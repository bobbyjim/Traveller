I don\'t think K\'kree "hatred of change" would restrict their exploration or
technical innovation. My understanding of the K\'kree is that they are
*socially* conservative and not *technologically* conservative. In
MegaTraveller Journal 4, the K\'kree take enormous risks and embrace things
like genetic engineering of themselves in order to expand their influence.
However, their social and military structure has remained unchanged for
millenia.

    'body' => 'There are a number of interesting things that
did NOT develop in Imperial history, who\'s absence
is a Good Thing.  The fact that they never
developed can be laid at the feet of Vilani 
conservativism, Solomani monotheisim,
or the vigourous independence of the
local systems.  Here\'s my hitlist
of Things that Never Were (Thank God!)

* The God-Emperor.  The Emperor has an
astounding amount of power and wealth: it would
be a cinch for him to create a personality cult
around himself.  Moreover, if you define godhood
strictly by the amount of power you have, then the
Emperor certainly qualifies as a god in the 
traditional pagan understanding. [1]

Yet NONE of the Emperor\'s - not even Lucan - 
tried to create such a cult.  Perhaps 
they were afraid of all the dirt the interstellar 
press could dig up, or riot\'s on every monotheistic 
society, or some massive revolt led by high-pop,
high-tech Imperial theocracies?

* Immortal nobility.  Anagathic\'s are currently
discouraged from noble use.  In a different, less
disiplined society, anagathtic\'s could be limited
ONLY for noble use.  Or immortality could be
obtained through genetic engineering.

The probable reason for this never happening
is the Younger Nobility, endlessly waiting for their
elder\'s to die.  This may have been tried before
ona smaller scale, and the younger nobility, 
after slaughtering their elders, resolved never 
to allow anti-aging technology to be used among 
themselves.

* Master Race. The Imperial Nobility define 
themselves as servant\'s to the Emperor.  Had
the nobility decided that they should instead define
themselves as superiour to the commoner\'s
they would have set up a genetic research program,
to make themselves as truly superiour.

Why did this never take off?  Well, this probably did 
happen in some subsector or another, but word
leaked out.  A serious uproar develops, and the
Emperor, to save his own throne, kills the guilty
nobility. [The charge?  Conspiring to overthrow the 
Emperor (High Treason) and Conspiracy to Enslave/
Genocide Imperial populations.]  Moreover, by law
no genetic "master race" may hold any noble title.

* The Levathian State.  Taxation is quite limited: 
and the Imperium doesn\'t even tax individuals or
world-bound business (except at the starport, or
Imperal systems under military occupation).
It\'s in the nature of governments to continually
expand their tax base, and to have an ever-expanding
bureaucracy.

This might have actually occurred at one time, but the
Civil War put an end to it.  Remember that Imperial
Buraucracy that ran the Imperium while the war was
fought?  Well, assume that Arbellatra decided that 
money needed to be found to repair the damage, and
decided to carve that funding from the hide of the
bureaucracy.  (The massively reduced tax rate 
helping out her popularity, and solidifying her 
hold on the throne).

Moreover, remember that she terminated
the Archduke of Antares for the treason of Not 
Supporting Her?  Assume that the bureaucracy 
got a massive downsizing for that same reason (not
as bloody - most were merely fired, and given a 
one-way ticket home...)   In addition, she zapped most
of the bureaucracy\'s power, returning it to her 
nobles (aka "Friends of Arbellatra").

* The Imperial Church.  Certainly, some of the
42 Emperor\'s and Emperess\' of the Imperium
must have been devout follower\'s of their
religion (or ideology, if atheist).  They have the
ship\'s, they have the men, and they\'ve got the
money too - why not get *everyone* to follow
the One True Faith?

In all probability, because A) they would have
angered a massive number of Vilani, who do not
want some religion interfering with their traditions
B) they would have angered the high-pop systems, 
who would have seen this as a stealthy way to get 
more power in the hand\'s of the Emperor 
C) They would have caused Serious Problems
with not only the system theocracies, but with the nobles
who have their (non-Imperial) titles based on local 
religions D) they would have angered the Solomani,
who are known for their devoutness to their God, 
compared to other forms of humaniti.

Moreover, it\'s unlikely that even devout 
Emperor\'s would really want to share
power with an Imperial Church, unless they control that
church as well.  Then you get the God-Emperor
issue...

One could imagine Vargr being at least a little startled by the variety of
dog breeds and the strong servile streak that has been bred into them.
One could also imagine revenge-minded Vargr breeding monkeys as pets to
develop specific characteristics - breeding them to look as much like
miniature humans as possible, but with exaggerated baboon-like posteriors,
for example.

	Do you have any citations for the "gravity" model?

	I don\'t think squaring the distance is a crazy idea since it\'s not
just the cost of transport that matters, it\'s also the time it takes to
get goods to market.  If you accept Ian\'s argument (which I do) that
economies of scale & specialization are going to play a big role in
interstellar trade, then you have to imagine that a great deal of trade 
is in intermediate goods -- goods that are inputs into other products.  
Since coordinating a supply chain in terms of inventory, design specs, 
defects, etc. is a communication intensive business, message lag times 
will be important.  Even in today\'s world of instant global 
communication, many manufacturers like to have their suppliers as close 
as possible.

	Also, the profitability of trade between two worlds is probably 
the thing most in need of fixing in the Traveller trade system.  As Ian 
has pointed out, economies of scale play a big role in RW trade.  
Increasing TLs are only likely to increase the benefits from 
specialization and make trade in intermediate goods more attractive.  We 
don\'t necessarily need to model this directly, but we do need a reason 
for the longer range trade that canon history says takes place.  Under 
current Trav trade rules, there\'s rarely reason to leave the subsector.  
Where\'s the adventure in that?

Uh... no.  The K\'kree, shortly after unifying their world (and eliminating
*all* of the native carnivores (meaning anything that ate any amount of meat),
discovered that their moon was inhabited by intelligent beings.  Their studies
let them conclude that the native sophonts were carnivores (descended from
chasers).  The k\'kree went from TL7 to developing fusion power, antigravity
(CG IMTU <g>), amongst others, completely skipping rocketry and primitive
spacecraft, etc...   The century long war also led to further development.
When they discovered Jump Drive they decided to make the universe safe and
eliminate or convert every meat eater they could find.  Colonization and such
were strictly secondary to that goal.  Converts were conquered and the
obstinate meat eaters were eradicated.
   Then they encountered the Hivers.  The Hivers were in the process of
uplifting a species that the K\'kree had decided to eliminate
(omnivore/hunters).  The K\'kree also learned that the Hive Federation included
carnivores and omnivores (gasp!).  War naturally resulted.

Numerous reasons.   Distance.  Problems of interstellar govt, and others.
They haven\'t been expansionist since the Hiver-K\'kree war.

The K\'kree hate anything that eats meat, regardless of whether it eats its
veggies, too.  Omnivores have as much to fear as carnivores.  All meat-eaters
must beware the K\'kree... I, for one, find the K\'kree\'s exploits with their
neighbors on their moon to be pretty horrific.  No attempt at dialogue, no
parley, no quarantine... just a war to exterminate them.

Margie dear had declared (within her space) thatafter a certain percentage
of cybernetics was attained, the suject was no longer a sophont, imperial
(margret\'s faction, at least) citizen, nor a protected being. So slavery
was techinically legal if the slaves were cybered sufficiently. Makes me

It actually parallels certain periods of Imperial Russia, and has parallels
in american history.

Not a fact at all, Anders. The Fact in evidence is that the ranking systems
in all editions of traveller which I have ever seen are derived from US
structures. With the noteable exception of marines, who seem to be only
slightly deviant, as perfectly beifts all marines I\'ve met (US, Can, and
RMC).


The more I read about the imperium, the more I understand it to be "Yanks
in space with imperial russian meritocratic nobility. And all the other
historians I\'ve loaned copies to see those same parallels, if pointed out.

Same reasons they discovered flight, etc. The occasional K\'Kree is
dangerously deranged, and if he\'s not a loner, he might actually do
something useful!

as for expansion, based upon the K\'Kree supplement, they believe the stars
their destiny. Rulers to be of all they can survey. They can see with the
naked K\'kree eyeball about two-thousand stars....

More like a realization that they\'d not survive as a species... genocidal
war tends to draw genocidal solutions from more than just the target. The
3rd imperium is larger, with better tech levels than the 2kworlds... which
are only around 6-700 mainworlds....

Also, they only exterminated those which were on worlds they were planning
to exploit soon, and adapted others that they could. Humans can be adapted;
the K\'Kree would feel there is hope for the "outworlder" humans. Cannon
provides that there are humans in the 2kworlds as minor races.

Small, automated meson-comm sensor-buoys in orbit, others in atmosphere on
gravitics. The latter could also be providing power by being constantly
skimming, then sending some of it as meson fire to a power reciever on the
orbitals.

Network these, and you can have a good view, while being totally out of
view. Especially if dumps are hourly, based upon sending the consolidator
drone your location, to which it sends data, then you scoot.

deep meson sites.

Why not use a specially designed meson locator ship?

The Target class, Deep Site Meson Locator is based around a spherical
hydrogen fuel tank (over 25,000std) specially designed so that it can
function as a bubble chamber.

Combined with the use of advanced monitoring devices and highly armoured
crew, electronics and power sections, any meson attack will be detected
and the direction can be determined. Several such shots should enable
a location to be determined sufficient for counter battery fire.

The Target class is designed to appear like a heavily armoured battle
rider - an ideal target for a deep meson site - its agility close to
planets should be enough to discourage missile attacks, along with its
point defence lasers.

To increase its utility outside of planetary attacks, the Target class
also functions as a fuel shuttle.

It\'s more common in space than it is on Earth.
For instance, the impact theory of dinosaur
extinction got started when geologist Walter
Alvarez mentioned a layer of clay at 65 million
years ago with abnormaly high levels of irridium
to his father, astrophysicist Luis Alvarez.


If that situation holds for other planetary bodies,
then it is symbolic of "ruling not planets, but
the space between them."

By modern definitions it *is* slavery*. After all, you are legally

Alas, Weber has a bad habit of not thinking things thru. For example,

You can find such diagrams in astronomy texts and various articles.

Note that the gravity won\'t increase very fast as you go deeper,
because the mass of any atmosphere farther out than you are no longer
affects you (for gravity). 

Pressures go up fairly fast. I don\'t recall what temperatures do.

It\'s escape velocity that\'s the killer.

You get paid for a job, and if you are willing to take the loss of pay,
you can quit. That makes it *voluntary* servitude. *Involuntary*
servitude is a different matter. So are kidnapping and "false
imprisonment" (the difference between the last two being that
kindanapping consists of dragging you off somewhere and then confining
you, whereas "false imprisonment" can be as simple as refusing to
unlock a double-locked door to let a person *leave* a place they
entered voluntarily)

Actually, gold is a *worse* conductor than copper. Silver is better
than copper. And it\'s about the only thing that is.

Gold is useful because of its malleability and ductility *and* because
its so corrosion resistant. So you\'d expect plumbing to be gold plated.
Especially sewer pipe. :-)

Hardly. NORAD SpaceWatch tracks space junk down to *inches* across
*optically* with *one meter* telescopes. These are about the size of a
garbage can.

Add in a fiber optic comm grid, and it\'s gonna be *really* hard to
prevent tracking. Especially when you can take *amateur* grade
telescopes and synthesize some damn good tracking data. 

Scopes that good or better will be on the local Internet equivalent and
more common than cameras are on the current internet. Normally, they\'d
be used for things like tracking comets (or shipping!) by local citizens. 
In time of war, they\'d be like the "coast watch" stations the Aussie
had all over the place. 

You run into the problem of deciding what is an isn\'t "civilian". And
worse, while it might be perfectly justifiable to decalre such things
"military" targets, *politically* it\'s not justifiable.

Now you understasnd why the amendment repealing slavery in the US says

You should clarify this by noting that intent to commit the action in
question is required. That is, if you *intended* to turn on the ships
Heplar drive, you are going to be in trouble even if you didn\'t intend
the *consequences* (vaporizing the crewman who was inspecting the
drive).

Well, given the increasing complexity of the laws, I wouldn\'t be
surprised to see a system where ignorance of some obscxure clause of
the law *would* be an acceptable excuse, if your conduct was otherwise
"sensible". 

In this, I\'m going for an extension of the "reasonable man" standard in
that a "reasonable man" could not be expected to know about the law in
question.

I guess you weren\'t paying attention. The wehole point has been that
the Imperium *does* require that member worlds enforce certain laws,
and the ban on slavery is part of this.

The thing is, you are taking those 6 g while lying flat on your back.
And any manuevers involve a *small* side acceleration  to get the main
drive pointed in the proper direction. Thias is true even for spinning
the ship 180 to decelerate. The thrust of the main drive *always* goes
in the same direction *relative to the pilot*.

This isn\'t at all like atmospheric fighters where you use control
surfaces against the airstream to change directions. There. the
accelerations from rapid turns tend to be in *bad* directions, such as
"head to feet" instead of "front to back".

NASA and Air Force studies show that there\'s very little problem
handling extended periods oif accelerastion on your back. 

So the "rules" for "g-tolerance" for aerial combat just plain *don\'t
apply* in space combat.

Huh? You must be using the pre-t4 sensor rules. Active sensor ranges

Actually, the above *will* work (sort of). You see. a cubic meter of
liquid water contains more hydrogen than a cubic meter of liquid
hydrogen! It also *masses* about a lot more.

Most simple hydrogen compounds contain more hydrogen by *volume* than
liquid hydrogen does. 

But the way I see it, the problem with the standard view is that you
*can\'t* store water and LH2 in the same tank. And doing so with gas
giant atmosphere and liquid hydrogen has its own problems. You really
want to have unrefined fuel in a *seperate* tank. from the one the
refined fuel will wind up in.

There are several techinques for "easily" seperating hydrogen from
other gases. For example, there are a lot of materials that hydrogen
will diffuse thru but nothing else will.

One major difference is that a depedent can leave, if of legal age, and
if *not* lergal age, can petition the courts to either be assigned a
new guardian, or if capable of supporting himself, petition for
"emancipated minor" status.

A slave can do none of these things.

As I recall, the courts eventually *di* decide that it amounted to
slavery. That\'s why companies can\'t do that anymore.

No, the line wasn\'t gray, it was merely drawn in different places at
different times. *All* the changes have been due to changes in
*definition*, for example the change in determining that blacks were
"people".

And BTW, we *do* still have slavery in the US. Mostly it\'s called
"prison". But there are quite recent cases of charges of slavery being
filed against people for importing "servants" from Mexico and then
confining them, not paying them and even beating them.

Again, while the rules may change at any given point in time they are
quite clear. And like any other law, they *will* be enforced.

Huh? Do you have documentation for this? Carbon monoxide production by
*oxyhdrogen* jets playing on limestone, that is.

Among other details, there\'s damn little carbon *present* once they\'ve
reached operating temp *once*. After that, the "lime" part is calcium
oxide. And since you are using hydrogen and oxygen in the flame, you
*can\'t* produce carbon monoxide!  You *do produce a lot of water vaopr
though. And it\'s not that hard to set things up to *start* with an
oxide, rather than a carbonate.

Aside from the large loses in slaves you\'ll suffer, if they have reason

Won\'t matter. If they can confirm that the sophonts *were* placed in
slavery and that you *knew* this was what was going to happen, they can
still throw the book at you.

Contracts signed under duress are invalid. Attempting to coerce someone
into signing a contract is a felony in *every* jurisdiction I\'ve ever
heard of.

Also, contracts requiring either party to commit an illegal act are in
themselves illegal.

That is illegal in and of itself. In fact that *constiutues either

Illegal, in anmd of itself, given the motive this *alone* is enough to

Illegal imprisonment.

Illegal. And again given the *motive*, enough to convict you of slavery.

And every single one of those constitues slavery in and of itself.

As I note above, all of your dodges are crimes in and of themselves
(slavery, kidnapping, or illegal imprisonment).

Wrong. It\'s no harder than busting *any* criminal ring. And every
single dodge you\'ve given above would IN ITSELF be sufficient evidence
to convict you!

What "exploitation cases"? If you are talking about your silly attempts
to hide the fact that you are *enslaving* those people, sorry, but they
don\'t make judges and juries *stupid* enough to fall for that sort of
nonsense.

Nope. Preventing enslavement is *good* for business. Slaves make lousy
customers. Free "men" make *good* customers.

You have *got* to be kidding. If not, I suggest that you get yourself
arrested and see how you like prison. Prison inmates (in the US) are a
lot "freer" than any slave.

Slaves can be worked until they drop. Inmates can\'t. Slaves get fed
whatever is cheap and will keep them going (unless they are cheap
enough, in which case the food may only prolong their starvation).
Inmates have to get not only "decent food" but frequently have sued to
get the variety improved!

The basic idea you are missing is that slaves have *no* rights.

A book wouldn\'t necessary say anything about that, unless the

Ok you have convinced me.  How thin a layer of gold is liable to be
sturdy enough for use in plumbing fixtures?  How will Traveller
technology change this?  If your starship has (thinly) gold plated
plumbing will the gold that comes loose be recoverable so it can be
reapplied?  Maybe part of a ships annual maintenance is pulling the gold
out of the bottom of the ships waste tanks & reaaplying it to the
plumbing ducts?

Since it is so thermally conductive as well maybe starship radiators are
made of, or at least coated with, gold?  You know I think I am beginning
to understand why Traveller starships cost tens of millions of credits.

Is this really the case for small, agile fighters, though? I\'d always
imagined that the excess power used to generate the \'agility\' score was
being used in off-axis thrusts (rather than spinning the boat in place),
whether you\'re vectoring the thrust axis of a T-Plate, or you\'ve got
additional *main nozzles* for the HEPLAR drive. Do we have a feel for
just how fast you can spin a 50 dton fighter around one of it\'s
non-thrust axes without having to cater for the kinds of stresses that
current aerospace fighters have to handle?

If I\'m dodging lasers, then I don\'t want to have to waste time rolling
and thrusting and rolling and GULLLLPPPPP....!

It\'s very Star Warsy, but if we\'re talking fighters instead of gunboats,
then I imagine the paradigm should be one of *flying* the ship, rather
than *plotting* movement - you use your automation to translate the
pilot\'s (aerospace-like) control inputs into the necessary
pitch/roll/yaw/thrust/VIFF commands.

The original AD&D Deities and Demi-gods had entries for the Cthulhu mythos.
Lovecrafts estate made them take it out of the next edition. It\'s now a

In traditional feudal systems with serfs, etc., the serfs are not
chattle property.
Its the treatment of people as personal property that is the hallmark of
slavery.
Feudal serfs weren\'t treated this way.  They were entitled to certain,
albeit few,
privileges from their feudal lord and vice versa.  Serf\'s didn\'t own the
land the
worked but were permitted to work the land and feed themselves from a
portion
of the benefits of the land.  Certainly feudal lords had incredible
rights over
the serfs, such as the right to take the virginity of all women in their
feifdom
in some cases.  But it is clearly distinct from slavery.  Serfs could
always leave.

Well, we don\'t really disagree.  My point that it will always be in the
jurisdictionof both the Imperium and Member worlds.  If the member world
takes care of it,
there is no reason for the Imperium to spend its valuable resources on
the problem.
However if the member world ignores it, and tolerates or allows it to
become
significant (wherever that threshold is for each regional Imperium
head), they\'ll
take a direct hand.

Its in the Warrant of Restoration, which is the nearest thing to a
written constitutionthat the Imperium has, as it applies to all member
worlds.

This is exactly in line with my thinking on the Imperial appellate
judicial administration.
Here\'s the outline I have.

Imperial District Court - Administered by the MoJ
(One in each starport, starport type and system population determines
size of this office - it may be 1000 judges with huge support staffs, or
a MoJ starport master who is also the Postmaster, Customs Officer, and
cook).
|
Appeals to the Subsector Court of Imperial Appeals - Adminstered by the
MoJ
(The losing party may appeal once.  This Court will sit at the Subsector
capital).
|
Subsector Duke
(Certiorari authority, i.e., further appeals may only be had at his
permission.
So, he can either pass a case along for further proceedings (but he
doesn\'t rule
on these), or he can reverse or remand the case for proceedings.  He
also has the
authority to alter damage awards, etc.)
|
Sector Supreme Imperial Court
(Must hear cases assigned to hit by a Subsector Duke.  Sits at the
Sector Capital.)
|
Sector Archduke
(Same authority as the Subsector Duke, but he may either send a case to
the final court,
or recommend the Emperor deal with it, directly).
|
The Court of the Imperium
(The highest of MoJ courts.  All judges are of Noble rank.  This court
has authority
to deal with disputes between Nobles, among other things, and can
recommend
to the Emperor that Nobles be stripped of all heriditary rights.)
|
The Emperor
(The last word on the law.  The Emperor may "reach down" and take
authority over
any matter desired, at any level.   The Emperor\'s power is complete and
final.
The Emperor surely excerises his power most by refusing to hear
appeals.)

Thats my first draft anyway.
If the Imperium is as litigious as the Western world,
85-90% of cases will settle before a District Court can rule.
99% of the cases heard in District Court will not be appealed.
99% of the cases appealled once will not be appealled twice.
Etc., etc.
So, we end up with a very, very low percentage of cases going up the
chain.
However, given the sheer size of the Imperium, its important to know the

potential limit.

Quite correct."General Intent" crimes/liabilities arise when you
intended to turn on the Heplar
drive, but didn\'t intend to start a fire in the downport.
"Specific Intent" crimes/liabilities are when you intended to kill
Strephon.  Even if you
miss and kill someone else, your intent transfers.

Hehe.  In Massachusetts, and probably other states, lawyers may not be
sued for malpractice from errors made in dealing with the Rule Against
Perpetuities.  Its the only subject matter that is treated this way.
Its actually a very easy rule to deal with, at least in my limited experience with it,
but no one is capable of expressing it eloquently in modern English.

Fair enough.  This kind of idea has often been applied with regard
to"boilerplate" fine-print in complicated contracts for unsophisticated
parties, i.e., non-business people, but has yet to used concerning
awareness of the laws of the state.  However, you can find interesting
dicta, i.e., language in a judicial opinion not necessary or part or the
decision, that says criminals must have "Fair warning" that their conduct
could constitute a crime.

The cost of owning the goods between source and market is a function of the
time taken and the cost of the goods, while the transport cost is a
function of the distance travelled and the volume of the goods (perhaps
with the mass of the cargo being a more minor factor). Cost of goods isnt
important for transport cost, except for insurance purposes.

My personal solution is for the GM to look at the map and plot something.
This only raises the issue of where the players get a jump-3 ship, but hey
... speaking of which, has anyone tried to convert a TL12 cruiser into a
trading ship ... it\'s obsolete, so buy it at surplus after it\'s struck off.
It\'s shakedown cruise could be a pass through the frontier, selling off
surplus bays, accumulators and dampers as it goes ...

Seriously, look at FFS or something similar with lots of hi-tech hi-value
goods. Any planet that has just stopped having a local war is a good one -
they want to buy goods to rebuild the civilian economies, and have all this
only-one-owner Army Surplus going cheap. Military goods can easily cost a
megacredit per displacement ton, so they are worth shipping a long way.

This is actually the key to making long-distance trade viable. If goods
cost a megacredit per dton, then you can ship them a hundred parsecs to get
a 10% rise in price. Long haul trade is only unviable when you assume that
goods will cost KCr 5-10 per dton, which is completely unreasonable with
the prices listed in the rest of the Traveller material.

Whilst not wanting to restart the piracy debate, very valuable cargos also
makes piracy by ethically challenged civilians less of a losing proposition
- - when cargos are worth hundreds of megacredits, it is worth it to risk a
ship.

There is a subtle difference between Slavery being illegal in the Imperium and
the Imperium requiring local laws against Slavery in order to sign the treaty.
I\'m all for local slavery laws.  But I can\'t see an interstellar government being
able to adjudicate every case.

Seems to me this should be either the Sector Duke, or the Domain 
Archduke, but not the Sector Archduke....  Perhaps the Sector Duke sends 
appeals to the Emperor, but the Archduke makes the decision (speaking 
for the Emperor, unless the archduke decides the case should go to the

emperor.)

Also, the K\'Kree aren\'t stupid. They\'re technologically inferior to the
Imperium, have no recent experience of major interstellar war, and suffer
from severe handicaps in starship design. In a war against the Imperium 
(unless the Imperium was otherwise distracted) they\'d get handed their
tails.  

Note that once the Imperium was distracted (by the Rebellion) they 
did start making trouble...

Ship detection ranges can be calculated from the sensors in FFS2 or from
my sensor rules (available at various places on the net, or email me privately
and I can send them to you.) The range at which ships can see each other 
(unsurprisingly) varies a lot; dinky civilian sensors might be able to see
another Free Trader out to a tenth of an AU, big military sensors could 
see a huge dreadnaught out to 30 or 100 AU if it wasn\'t masked. 

Seeing planets is more complicated. Good science sensors can probably detect
gas-giant planets out to 30 parsecs or more and earthlike planets to several
parsecs (maybe even 10 for a big PEMS-14.5sci array.) I posted some rules on
this (and on looking for free-floating objects), but I\'m not 100% happy 
with the detection-of-planetary-companion rules yet.

If the MoJ knows about it, and can find you, you are done. And if
slavery is bad enough to the Imperial conscience, only an insane
lawyer would try to defend you.

(Historical example, Terra, post Oliver Cromwell\'s revolution in
England: in the backlash against the roundheads, Judges were
willing to apply the most horrendous punishments not only
against suspected revolutionaries, but also against anyone who
attempted to defend them. Punishments like, "drag him naked
behind a galloping horse through every village in the county once
a week, leaving him chained in a dungeon otherwise, until he dies".)

Imperial Law, in the Imperium, exists as a diplomatic convenience,
a matter of treaty and commerce. When faced with something
offensive, like slavery, the MoJ can find ways to walk around
any inconvenient parts of it.

to the point where the "slaves" would fight against an outsider to maintain

I have been in the process of developing one for, well - a long time now.
(sigh)  It\'s still up on my list of \'THINGS I MUST DO\', but obviously, not
on my list of things I have done.  Real Life is such a distraction!  ;)

I\'ll stop adding features and just try and get the durn thing coded and out.
It is intended to be a 32-bit VB app, which means a Win9x or WinNT platform
to run it on.

The software advertised was never release - I tried to order it!  :(

The company that contracted for the development backed out, I never heard
why - just got my check back (ahem...*uncashed*) with a short note.

	I\'m not arguing with you about the cost of interstellar trade, 
I\'m making a point about the *demand* for interstellar trade.  Since 
relying on a source of supply that takes weeks or months to communicate 
with is in and of itself costly (necessitates large inventories, 
increases problems with coordination, means defects are likely to go 
uncaught before a lot of bad products have already been made, etc.) 
people are likely to avoid such situations where possible.  This means 
products that require cospecialization and frequent communication are not 
good candidates for long distance trade.
	I was basically trying to point out that having at least some 
kinds of trade drop off with the inverse square of distance isn\'t a crazy 
idea.

	A very good point.  Higher value cargos would solve a lot of 
inconsistencies between Traveller background and rules.  
	The Al Morai trading company in the Spinward Marches maintained
routes for centuries that connected all the subsector capitals of the
Marches.  Now unless this was merely a private x-boat service, there must
have been something worth transporting so far.  Since piracy is also a
part of the background, and one that many people like, being able to
create an incentive for that activity with high value cargos is also nice. 
	High value cargo gives the incentive and long-distance trade may 
give the means since it gives more ships a reason to pass through poorly 
defended backwater systems on their way to a more profitable destination.

This is true - but is it _chattel_ slavery?  The Warrant of
Restoration explicitly prohibits _chattel_ slavery, but says
nothing of serfdom, peonage, debt slavery, or any others of
probably a million different kinds of involuntary servitude.

Slavery as practiced in the United States prior to the 1860s is
absolutely verboten - that\'s inarguably chattel slavery.  But
slavery on the Roman model (debt enslavement) or medieval model
(manorial serfdom) isn\'t chattel slavery, and is arguably
allowable in the Third Imperium.  It\'s very definitely a gray
area, and I intended it so when I wrote that paragraph.

It\'s entirely possible I\'m mistaken, but I thought that limestone
had a fairly high amount of carbon compounds in it, so that no
matter _what_ you used as the gas, there was CO production at a
level that the U.S. Government would find unacceptable for use in
enclosed spaces.

Last Euro Gen Con the fun Traveller scenario had the players seting up a
\'McBurger\' franchise on the local 2000 worlds subsector capital. They
didn\'t know what this chain was before the <magically> expanding box full
of material expanded with those two gold arches.

Then they started running...

Check out "Backus-Naur" notation. It\'s used for defining "syntax" when
designing programming languages. I\'ve found that any well-written law
becomes *much* shorter and clearer when translated into it, and even
poorly written ones become clear (or at least the ambiguities jump out
at you). 

It also encourages you to take sub-sections that are frequently
repeated (eg the section in the Child Pornography law that describe
*what* sort of "activity" in a [film/photo/video/etc/etc] is "child
pornography") and either give them a name, or make them an
"independent" sub section so as to avoid the endless repetition. 

(I picked the kiddie porn law because as a BBS sysop I\'ve studied it
 *very* carefully!)

Anyway, I can *hope* that by the time the Imperium arrives, we\'ll have
had the legislators, lawyers, and syntax design people get together and
come up with a *rational* way to describe laws.

Well, I\'m reminded of the time that the company I was working for
needed to expand their parking lot. They got the permit, and had
actually started construction before some drone at City Hall noticed
that we were in an area that the City had designated as some sort of
"Greenway" or the like, and thus we had to add a lot of landscaping to
the plans (which delayed things almost a year, because by the time the
plans were re-drawn, the "rainy season had started and construction was
impractical.).

I\'m sure this regulation was published *somewhere*. But I\'m equally
sure that it was buried amid a lot of unrelated stuff.

By my lights, a local regulation that affects only a limited area
should be accompanied by a mailing to the owners of properties in said
areas notifying them of the new rules...

I wouldn\'t count failure to get the notification as a complete defense,
not unless it could be shown that the city/county hadn\'t made a
"reasonable" effort to notify the affected people. 

The day when being published in the federal register constituted
adequate notice for the average person or small business owner is
*long* past. 

Hopefully, as computers and the Internet continue to spread, there wil
evolve some sort of expert system that you can tell what you want to do
(or not do) and it can tell you: yes, no, or "talk to a lawyer". 

But first we have to dethrone outfits like Westlaw who are turning
public domain info (the laws passed by Congress) into *proprietary*
info. 

Forgive the ranting, but this has long been an issue with me.

On the other hand, the Imperium can set "standards" for the local laws.
In which case, there are bureaucrats in the IMOJ who spend their entire
day going over the reports of arrests and trials under the local laws
that are Imperially mandated. And cross-checking with news items and
complaints sent to the IMOJ. 

If they find a discrepancy or something suspicious, they\'ll push for an
investigation (after all, if they are right, it\'ll improve their
chances for promotion, and even if they are wrong they can say that
they were "just doing my job").

So if a planet is truly enforcing the laws as intended, no problem,
just a lot of boredom for the IMOJ clerk in charge of monitoring them.
If it isn\'t, then things get interesting. 

Remember, you *can\'t* charge the Imperium with "malicious prosecution".

There were times and places where it was illegal for the serf to leave
his land. But they were the exception.

Heck, for that matter, the ideal of fuedalism is a lot different than
what most people think of.

In a way, feudal relationships were the beginning of contract law. A
vassal didn\'t just swear oaths to his lord. They swore oaths to *each
other*. Failure by *either* party to carry out his duties voided the
oaths.

Heck, this has the potential to be a lot better than the current setup
for a lot of things. For example, you and your boos would have
interlocking oaths, either that or you\'d have oaths with someone higher
up and the boss would be their representative. So if you felt the boss
was mistreating you, you\'d actually have grounds to challenge his
behavior as being in violation of the "contract". 

The problems come when the oaths become pro forma, rather than actually
reflecting the needs and desires (and *duties*!) of each side.

Oh yeah, another interesting point is whether or not feudal
relationships are transitive. That is, you\'ve sworn to your ship\'s
captain, and he\'s sworn to Lord so-and-so. If the feudal relationships
are transitive (fairly rare in history except during eras where the
royalty were attempting to centralize power and *destroy* the fuedal
system) then Lord so-and-so can give you orders, because as a vassal of
his vassal, you are his vassal as well. If the feudal relationships are
*not* transitive, then Lord so-and-so has to give orders to your
captain, who then decides which of his people would be best to carry
them out. The the *captain* issues appropriate orders.

This is a much more *personal* system than modern society is used to.
But it may actually be *more* workable (and "livable") *because* of this.

It\'d be fun running players up against a planet that did fuedalism
*right*. :-)

You aren\'t as apt to get the "petty bureacrat" mentality, because
acting that way makes your "lord" look bad. And that\'s a *big* no-no. 
Honor provides a lot of checks and balances in such a system.
Especially since people *won\'t* swear to a person who has been shown to
be dishonorable (ie has failed to carry out *his* side of the
"contract").

Well, it helps to remember that the K\'kree evolved alongside a
carnivore species that was almost as intelligent. Details aren\'t
available as the K\'kree attained civilization and technology as part of
the struggle to exterminate the carnivore species.

On the other hand, Nazi Germany (and to some extent the USSR) made

I\'ll bet that there are some fairly severe restrictions on the *terms*
of an indenture contract though. Limits on work hours, limits on type
of work (mostly according to local mores, in "Kansas" even "exotic
dancing" as a duty might be forbidden", while in "Nevada" sexual
activities could be legal "duties").

There\'d also be limits on the term. And on what sort of things could
result in an increase in the term. Basicly, an average or even somewhat
*below* average person should be able to earn themself free in a
reasonable period. On another other tentacle, someone who refuses to
put any effort into his work, and keeps "accidentally" breaking things
(as a means of "getting back" at the boss) could be indentured for a
*long* time. 

Another item is likely to be a basic part of the contract. Namely, is
the contract transferable. And if so, to what extent. For example, it\'d
be unusual for a contract to be transferable to an owner on another
world without the agreement of the indenturee.

See my post about the way the feudal system was *supposed* to work.
Under that sort of system, it\'s pretty workable.

The key is making sure that the "lord" has duties to the serf, and that
failure to carry them out releases the serf. So if the crops are bad
due to a drought or some other thing beyond the serf\'s control, the
lord has to supply food from *his* reserves. If he doesn\'t, the serfs
can legitimately consider their "contract" null and void and leave for
a lord who could use more serfs (and there will usually be such
*somewhere*).

Honour was the big reason in most places *before* the Church got really
strong. If the lord didn\'t carry out his obligations to the serfs,
they\'d quit carrying out their obligations to *him* and fade into the
forests. This tended to be *really* bad for the lord in question.

There\'s a difference between a "servant" and a "vassal". The only duty
you have towards a servant is to pay them, and possibly to feed and
clothe them. And you can terminate the relationship whenever you feel
like it.

A vassal is bound to you by a web of oaths, duties and obligations. One
that goes *both* ways. The oaths spell out each parties obligations to
the other (like a contract). And the relationship is only terminated by:

Death of one party
Mutual consent
Violation of the terms

That last one is important. It means that if you fail to carry out your
obligations to a vassal he is free to consider himself no longer a
vassal. If he fails to carry out his obligations, you can dump him too.

Honor gets into it too. Failure to carry out the obligation means that
one has lost honor unless one has tried their best and still failed. So
if a vassal owes you a company of troops for up to X months a year, and
due to a plague or some such, he can\'t supply them all, it\'d be
considered abuse of *your* power to terminate the relationship if he
did his best to scrape up troops for you.

If he just made a half-hearted effort then you can tell him he\'s no
longer your man. 

Likewise, if (as is likely) part of your oaths to him are to aid and
protect him, then you\'d better have sent medical help for that plague.
Ditto for sending a reasonable amount of help if his territory is
attacked.

But as you can see, this is *far* different from a servant/master
relationship.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
According to some information I\'ve seen, "Indentured Servants" were often
worse off than slaves - at least in 17th and 18th century UK/America.
The signing of the contract in the first place was often nonexistant - unless
you count getting conked on the head by a labor gang signing a contract.
You woke up on a transport at sea, were dropped off at a labor market
in the Carolinas or Carribean, and were worked to death usually in
the first year. Not hard to do, especially since you were probably about
twelve years old. If there was a contract, you never saw it or signed it...
a family member might have, or a magistrate might have given a labor
broker leave to clean up some "surplus population". If there was a 
contract, it was worded so you\'d never get out of it - your room and
board, whether you got any or not, would cost more than you were
paid, so your debt to whoever bought your contract would simply grow.

Robert Louis Stevenson\'s hero in _Kidnapped_ was facing just such a
fate from what was then a common occurance - his uncle intended
to get rid of an unwanted orphan relative by selling him (for next to
nothing) to a labor broker. Stevenson didn\'t make this up out of
thin air - the threat he challenged his hero with was made from the
happenings of his day.

The horrors of Workhouses and Prisons we\'ve seen from Charles
Dickens were nothing compared to what happened to those 
who fell to the labor gangs. A lucky few (of the half or so who
survived the trans-atlantic voyage) might have their "contracts" bought
by people needing farm workers, craftsman\'s assistants, or other
survivable lives. Most went to the logging camps, sugar plantations,
and mining operations that used up "indentured servants" faster than
they could be supplied. 

There was a large underclass, especially in the cities of the United
Kingdom, that quite literally no one cared about. If some of them
were taken from their hovels and died in some unknown land, what
of it? There were always more. 

The factors that lead to this practice dying out were several and slow
to work. It was almost the turn of the century before chimney sweeps
couldn\'t buy four-year old boys from their parents and drive them to
their deaths in hot, cramped chimney flues. 

ObTrav: Slavery, serf, indentured servant, prisoner - these terms mean
what the governing power wants them to mean, for as far as they want
to enforce these meanings. If you are in a part of space where no
one cares, or are of a class of people no one cares about, you can
have anything done to you for a very long time. Say you\'re a sophont
race that no one will accept as sentient, for example.

Well, to start with, it makes good sense to put the pilot at the center
of masss of the ship. So that minimizes the sideways accelerations he
feels. Figure a max of 1 meter from the CM, and any rational spin rate
for the ship produces pretty low accelerations as perceived by the
pilot. 

Also, you get a much *stronger* (and lighter!) design if you fix the
main engine in place and use steering jets or the like. and unless the
thrust vector passes thriu the center of mass of the ship, the thrust
will put a *spin* on it!


	Acceleration on a cylinder (space colony, etc.) of radius r and
	    rotation period t:

	    a = 4 pi**2 r / t^2

So, let\'s plug in aa radius of 1 meter and see what sort of rotation
rate it takes to give one g.

10 = 4 * pi^2 * 1 / t^2
2.5 = pi^2/t^2
2.5 * t^2 = pi^2
t^2 = pi^2/2.5
t^2 = 1.9869...

So you can do a 180 turn in *one* second and the pilot would feel a
whole 1g "outwards". 

I\'d say that\'s adequate performance, wouldn\'t you?

The reason aircraft experience higher g loads is that the aircraft is a
*long* ways from the center of the turn. 

BTW, note that the acceleration increases *linearly* with radius, so
you *don\'t* want long narrow fighters. The stress at the points
farthest from the center gets pretty bad. Instead you want something
like the fighters B5 uses. Roughly spherical, with the attitude jets on
outriggers to increase the moment arm (giving faster turns). 

And as I said before, the advantages of placing the pilot at the center
of mass *far* outweigh any disadvantages. For one thing, except when
docking, unaided eyesight is pretty much useless. So you don\'t *need*
360 degree vision. Instead, you places subsystems so as to give the
pilot extra protection.

Doesn\'t make a bit of difference. The *only* way to change your course
is by doing a burn with the main engine. Movement is space works by
vector addition, and your main drive is the only thing powerful enough
to make a significant 

Fighter pilots aren\'t susceptible to motion sickness, or else they
don\'t last long.

Well, that\'s another thing. Given the velocities involved, and the
accelerations provided by the main drive "Viffing" is not possible. Not
in a useful manner. Most of the dodging is likely to be handled by the
computer, while the pilot worries about where he wants to be when.

I expect that one of the displays will be a sort of "plot" showing the
fighter, and with several circles surrounding it, showing where he can
be at various times at various accelerations. (spheres if you have 3d
displays). The pilot would control a dot that indicates where he
actually wants the future position to be.

This is a lot harder to *describe* than to visualize. I may have to try
writing a "fighter vs fighter" game.... :-)

ps. one *big* advantage of being in space is that course and
orientation are mostly un-coupled. So you can be going like a bat out
of hell in one direction while firing your main weapon in a quite
different direction.

It won\'t take a lot of gold. After all, in normal use the contents of

Well, for radiators it\'s *emissivity* not conductivity that counts. As

Iridium generally costs somewhat *less* than platinium, but more than
gold. It gets the name because its compounds have lots of iridescent
colors. 

Iridium (in the form of platinum iridium alloys) is noted for
*stability*. Not only are such alloys corrosion resistant, but they are
thermally stable (that is they don\'t expand and contract much as
temperature changes). That\'s why they were used in creating standards
for mass and length in the old days.

And about those asteroids. Actually, asteroids *arte* well
diferentiated. It\'s just that after they cooled, collisions broke off
chunks of the stony "crust" leaving behind the exposed "core". Makes
mining a lot simpler.

I did use the table. But there was a time when I could *draw* a
periodic table from memory and be fairly accurate. If there were any
lists (even partial) of elements around that gave atomic number, I
could draw an empty table and fill in from them.

	I\'d be interested to hear what your idea of Feudal Technocracy 
might look like.  I\'m interested because I\'m detailing Oriflamme in the 
RC.  I think it is an interesting world precisely because F-Techs seem to 
be generally portrayed as oppressive.

	This is actually a class of problems I\'ve studied.  Economists 
class them under Transaction Cost Economics or Agency Theory.  You have a 
problem in defining when an adverse crop yield is the result of an 
exogenous event (eg. drought) or through failure by one party or another 
(eg. laziness).  Who gets to decide?  How does one allocate 
responsibility?  Maybe there was a mild drought, but the serfs took this 
as license to slack off and the resulting drop in crop yield was much 
greater than it needed to be.  You can try to create a dizzingly complex 
contract that specifies all this, but there will always be things you 
can\'t anticipate and/or the need to adapt to changing circumstances will 
exceed you ability to quickly write a new contract.  The only solution is 
to align the incentives of the parties sufficiently well that they have 
the same interests.  In the context of the above example, that means the 
lord and serfs splitting the crop yield so that the serfs have an 
incentive to work hard on the lord\'s land and the lord has an incentive 
to provide the sort of capital improvements (irrigation ditches, etc.) 
that will improve yields for everybody.  It\'s not perfect but it is, in 
general, the best solution.

	I\'m not sure how this would work in practice, either in a 
Medieval or Futuristic context.  The serfs still have to eat.  I suppose 
Medieval serfs could live off the bounty of the forest for a limited 
time, but not indefinitely.  Technocratic serfs are likely living in 
their liege\'s housing and using his TV cable system.  More likely they\'d 
just practice the sort of work slowdowns and "accidental" breakages that 
you mentioned under indentured servitude.

	I think the only way to make a feudal system work well, especially
in a futuristic context, is to make Honor very important.  Ambiguous
situations will still be subject to different interpretations, but if one
party isn\'t seen by the public to be genuinely working toward the common
good it will lose honor, making future dealings with *anyone* in that
honor-bound society more difficult.  The economic models I mentioned above
all assume that people practice "self-interest seeking with guile" meaning
they are willing to lie and cheat as long as they can get away with it
under the letter of the contract.  To the extent that a Feudal Technocracy
is able to culturally eliminate such behavior, I think it will be a viable
system.  An F-Tech gov\'t might even be desirable in the same way that a
benevolent dictatorship is said to be the best form of government.

That works well for things that they know are there already but doesn\'t take
into account what search procedures are in place.  The thing they are
tracking that\'s just inches across is a wrench dropped by a cosmonaut YEARS
ago.  That\'s not new or noteworthy, they already knew its track and exactly
where to look for it....All data on it is in a major dBase and they just
look it up when they want to go look for it.

I agreed with you right up to the last point.  Serfs couldn\'t always
leave.

In some cases Serfs were bound to the land (not the Lord, but the
land) and could not legally leave...period.  In most other cases,
they had to get permission from the Lord (or his representative) and
provide an acceptable replacement to work the land they were
leaving. 

Even if they did leave, legally or illegally, where was there to go?
Towns and cities.  Ok, if you could get to one, if you could get one
to let you through the gates if you got there, if you could get a
job once you got in.  Vagrancy was frowned upon, in both town and
country.

OTOH, the Lord could usually find a way to get rid of serfs if he
wanted to.  And if he and his peers engaged in a little rape,
pillage, and murder who was going to stop, or bring them to justice?
Not their victims (they couldn\'t), not their peers (they wouldn\'t,
not for peasents), not the church (they didn\'t care about the
physical, just the spiritial), and not the King (as long as he got
his cut and the peasents didn\'t revolt, he didn\'t care).

No, serfdom wasn\'t slavery, but it was the next thing to it.

There\'s a song I\'ve heard sung around a Society for Creative
Anachronism campfire, that they tell me is based on an old
folk song one didn\'t sing when the Laird of the Manor was in
earshot. It\'s called "Worms of the Earth". It\'s based on what
a couple hundred desperate men can do when they know
they have nothing to lose.

"They\'ve killed us before and tomorrow we die, but we\'ll
drink from their helmets tonight..."

It was about the serfs of a manor ridding the world of their
lord, though they knew that (by the social contract of the
day) it meant the lords around them would slay them all.
It was a warning to those lords as well - aye, we\'ll die for
it, but push us too hard and others will have to avenge you
as well...you\'ll be avenged, but you\'ll be just as ignobly dead.

Contracts working both ways aren\'t generally based solely
on honor. Many are based on fear as well...

Yes, Leonard, but serfs and peasants weren\'t covered by such things.
Oaths of fealty were between Nobles...peers.  Serfs weren\'t
considered the peers of the nobility.  Any thought of equality
between the peasant in the field and the Lord in the castle would
have been considered *real* heresy.  ;-> Serfs weren\'t slaves, but
don\'t make them out to be anything but oppressed.

You are probably correct.  I\'m not up to date on my Nobility/Region of
Control, so Duke, Archduke, whatever.  I meant whoever is the rank noble
for the sector.

Don\'t know anything about domains.

Gold is considered a good *reflector* of IR.  It has been used as an

Its in Milieu 0, in the reference data.  Very handy place for it, since
that book covers the beginning of the Third Imperium.

Although I have referenced it frequently here, I imagine it is not the
only very important legal document of the 3I.  I picture the legal
backdrop of the 3I similar to the UK, or at least my understanding of
it.  There is no one written constitution, as there is in the US, to
which all citizens may look for the bedrock law of the government.  This
isn\'t an especially prudent thing to do for an Emperor and it will be
moot if the Emperor changes his mind.

What I picture is a very select few documents that are cited as legal
authority that in total, paint
the backdrop of fundamental Imperium law, and to which most Emperors
accede.  The general nature of such documents as well as their rarity,
give most emperors enough wiggle room to say that they are acting within
the letter of Imperium constitution/fundamental law, while actually able
to do whatever they want.  Thus placating member worlds.  [From what
little I know about MT, there may be some reason for this in that
situation].

As far as actual written laws go, I think the Romano-German tradition
found in England, France, Germany, etc., is appropriate, where the laws
are often brief and in general language, and the courts are not bound by
precedent (Stare Decisis), as they are in the US (at least on paper).
That gives a court freedom to decide the same situation differently in
different cases.

Uhmm, the US legal system is almost entirely based on the English Common 
Law system (to the extent where decisions in one are obiter <sp> in the other). 
I think what you are referring to is the Civil Code systems prevelant on the 
continent. IMTU I\'ve always assumed that the Imperial legal system is an 
inquisitorial Civil Code system rather than an adversorial Common Law system 
(eg the US, England and most of the Commonwealth). IMTU you have Imperial 
tribunals (3 to 5 judges) which decide both law and fact.

IMTU law theoretically derives from the Moot not the Emperor (a Sylean 
holdover), but the Emperor as President of the Moot is the instrument of the law 
and as such the legal system runs down parallel to the Nobility, every Imperial 
noble is in theory a judge, but in practice they delegate their authority to a 
trained court. All but the most minor cases are heard in County court in the first 
instance (most Barons and Marquis do not have courts, but do occassionally 
hear minor cases; sort of like current JP\'s). An appeal to a Ducal court is 
usually automatic, with further appeals being by leave only (requiring a serious 
point of law or fact). Aquitals can only be appealed on the grounds of purjury. 
Some serious cases (treason etc.) are heard directly in a Ducal court, but the 
superior courts (Sector Ducal, Archducal, and Imperial) are stricly appellant in 
nature. Courts are not bound by precident, but are required to "be guided by" (a 
deliberatly vague term) decisions of superior courts (note they are not required 
to "be guided by" other courts of the same level). The courts are inquistorial 
and the judges are required to determine the facts as well as the law, as such 
they call witnesses and question them. Both parties to any case are _required_ 
to engage council and councillors may ask leave of the courts to call or 
question witnesses (but the court can in theory refuse). Note here that 
councillors do not have the automatic right to call or even question witnesses, 
but that a refusal would be very good grounds for an appeal.

It\'s in the T4 rules.

The Warrant of Restoration is the founding
document of the Third Imperium, where Cleon
lays claim to the legacy of the First and
Second Imperiums (Imperii?) [thus the
"restoration" of Imperial govenment], 
and establishes the basics of the 3I\'s political 
and organizational structure.

You are assuming that the clerk is on world. That\'d be
*extraordinarily* stupid of the Imperium. More likely he\'s at the
subsector capital.

There\'s a 4th book, "Drakon"(?). It has a Draka from a time several

Well, that explains why I never saw it...Is it actually written out or
just sort of glossed over?  What are the key points?

The slavery clause sounds suspiciously like a political gambit.  Slavery
seems incongruous to the politcal and organizational structure that the
rest of the Warrant describes.

And just how does multiple parsecs of distance make him any less of a mushroom
if the local world wants to keep their dirty little secret?

anyone could help.

As you may be aware I\'ve been creating a bibliography of the \'big 5\'
Traveller periodicals.  I\'ve endeavoured to "locate" adventures and other
material wherever possible in known space, but have struck a blank on a few
worlds.

Is anyone able to provide a sector and hex location for any of the
following (as well as a reference as to how you know):

Essex
Hinterworlds.  Mentioned in Challenge 48/50/51 \'Behind Blue Eyes 1-3\'

Giettaciin
Traveller Chronicle 8, \'Tsuga Orbital\'

Githiaski
"Githiaski/Dartho 0806 on the fringe of the Lesser Rift" if that helps.
Mentioned in JTAS 16, \'Contact: The Githiaskio\'

Melantris
Old Expanses.  JTAS 24, \'The Dynchia\'

Mikkadhir
Challenge 75, \'The Long Fall Club\'

Stataorlai
Supposedly in the Kyaenkha subsector of Dark Nebula sector but not in the
_Solomani and Aslan_ version that I can see.  JTAS 20, \'Raid on Stataorlai\'

Vrirhlanz
Vargr Extents, JTAS 22, \'Contact: The Hlanssai\'




I have about 20 other worlds too, but I\'m reasonably convinced these were
not located anywhere specific.  If anyone wants to see these and have a go
at locating them, contact me and I\'ll send the list.  (Early JTAS articles
often referred to a world as \'in the Spinward Marches\' even if it\'s not
appeared on any sector map that I\'ve ever seen.  Lorelei, JTAS 21,
\'Homesteader\'s Stand\' seems to be an example of this.)

 It is possible that some of the above are the same, but as they have
little location info, I thought it worth a shot.


Many thanks and good hunting.  I should say that I\'ve had a fair crack at
trying to find them homes but I\'ve done hundreds of worlds and my eyes may
be swimming!

	Yes, it\'s a great book.  I plan to use \'it\' as a most evil

There\'s always the possibility of putting such a planet into a system
named by another world. That is a point that confuses me sometimes - e.g.
Regina has a lot more other worlds, some of them populated. But you get
not much information of these. 
The only exeption might be Sol - besides Earth, Mars would be populated
too.

What if you were to make use of "retractable surfaces" like are used 
with the corsairs, or flow through openings or channels in the hull of 
the sphere?  You could probably create something that would give small 
lift surfaces, but I have no idea if it would really be feasible.

You don\'t need lift as much as you need steering vanes. In-atmosphere
work requires much tighter maneuvering than deep space work,
thinks are closer by a couple orders of magnitude.

If your contra-grav is good enough, your fighter might be able to
work in atmosphere just as well as it does in space - just slower
because of atmospheric resistance. In that case, you\'d go with the
semi-spherical body styles we were talking about earlier. 

On the other hand, you might not have the power on board for
sufficient contra-grav, or may want to spend it elsewhere. In that
case, you might build your fighter in a hypersonic airframe, so you
can buy some lift from all that soup you\'re flying through.

	Fortunately I\'ve read those books, otherwise I\'d have no idea 
what you\'re talking about.  I don\'t think Barrayar is a feudal 
technocracy, just feudal.  Niven & Pournelle make reference to something 
like "industrial feudalism" very briefly in Mote in God\'s Eye, but I got 
the impression that it would produce things like "Baron of Garbage 
Collection."  I\'m looking for something that transplants the notion of 
nobility and feudal obligation onto the complexity of a technological 
society.

This world will be in the rimward (Imperial) part of The Empty Quarter sector 
or the coreward end of Ley sector.  I don\'t know if either of those sectors has 
been detailed, though.

0633 Leonidae   A6669C7-C

This is the 2nd sector to trailing of Old Expanses.  The author wrote the 
article without reference the the Atlas of the Imperium, so made up his own 
sector names and world locations, which do not agree with that source.  I 
assume he had only the known space map shown in the Library Data LLBs, and the 
Dynchia occupy the blob straddling the rimward border between Hinterworlds 
and Leonidae sectors.  Alas, but when the Hinterworlds were written up later in 
Challenge, they did not try to fit the Dynchia in, and a different polity 
occupies that blob of space.

The adventure was written before Dark Nebula was detailed, and didn\'t make it

Even a Jump-1 vessel will be 99% fuel, bridge, and drives, so it looks
like Sansterre ain\'t going anywhere without lots of deep space refueling
platforms.

(Thanks to Jim Vassilakos, Galactic is a wonderful program)

The shortest route out of the clusters is still a long haul.
It looks like Zuflucht can send a Jump-7 ship to Tonnurad in
Usher/Reft sector. I\'ll bet this is where _El Dorado_ left Islands
Cluster from after getting help at Serendip Belt. I am wondering
at the scouts who made the voyage back to the Clusters after
the war - what a trip (scenario idea?) that must have been.
And once the scouts discovered Serendip Belt trying to use their
copied Jump drives to take over the cluster, how did they distribute
the secret? One jump ahead of the Serendip Starfleet? Or were the
Serendipians doing an economic domination, rather than a military
one?

Imagine how much things changed for the Islands cluster after
_El Dorado_\'s visit. Peoples who had, for generations, only known
the occaisional interstellar visitor. I\'ll bet C-Jammer and the other
asteroid-hulled STL colony ships were\'nt combat vessels.
If their radio astronomy was up to it, they may have recieved or even
sent messages to the Imperium beyond the Rift - 30 years
one-way transmission time or more. They may have known that
FTL was possible, but I doubt that they\'d have built or maintained
defense fleets or planetary defense bases. In their world, you
could see an invasion fleet about a decade away or so.

Suddenly, without warning, ships appear out of nowhere 
only 100 diameters from their homeworlds. Serendip ships, then
the ships of the worlds granted Jump drive by the IISS. In a
generation or so they go from isolated worlds to connected
worlds, it takes a week to get to the system next door instead
of generations. The disruption must have been amazing.

    'body' => 'My personal opinion (which should not be construed as an attack upon 
anyone elses opinions) is that fighters have the following roles in the 
Traveller universe (I define a fighter here as a sub-100-ton craft 
without significant transport roles and with an emphasis on manoeuvre 
performance and armament):

1. Reconnaissance. This could be performed physically (i.e. there is no 
enemy here because I\'m here), or by providing inputs to a very long 
baseline array for high-resolution, long range, sensing. Larger units 
could perform these roles but this could lead to dispersal of effort. 
This role may require a high endurance fighter design with a 2 or more 
crew and bunking.

2. Shadowing. Here a fighter is able to detect and shadow other forces 
performing a \'light cavalry\' role. If the shadowed unit wishes to chase 
the fighter away it is unlikely to be able to catch the fighter and if 
your enemy wishes to chase inferior units with larger vessels he\'s 
welcome. This role requires a fighter with long endurance and ideally the 
ability to detect it\'s target while remaining undetected or then good 
anti-missile defenses.

3. Ground attack. Space fighters, despite their inferior performance 
compared to atmospheric fighters, do represent significant firepower on 
the Striker battlefield. They also represent rather poor targets for deep 
meson guns, being hard to hit and massively overkilled if hit.

4. Attack of weak units. This includes shooting up freighters/supply 
ships (I certainly wouldn\'t want a Traveller Universe where the PC\'s 
\'freighter\' couldn\'t be attacked by a group of fighters :) ). Even a 
naval auxilliary would not want to waste significant displacement on 
armour and weapons that it could use to carry fuel, or missiles - it 
would probably be better to spend the cost of armour or weapons on 
escorts and then send the valuable hold space away while battle is 
joined. Other vulnerable targets would include enemy cripples or possibly 
enemy SDBs (but I expect that these latter would not be popular targets, 
much like attacking PFs with fighters in SFB). This is probably the only 
role in which I would expect to see massed fighters making concentrated 
attacks, and their relative performance advantage should allow them to 
concentrate on selected targets.

I agree with many posters that the attack of capital units and especially 
of integrated (fleet) squadrons would be an act of desperation or 
suicidal stupidity. These are not SFB, Starfire or Star Wars fighters. I 
do however feel that an allocation of 2-5% of displacement on a cruiser 
or larger ship may be worthwhile to allow some of the roles above to be 
performed they add to ship flexibility. This is especially true on ships 
like the AHLs which will not be accompanied by many escorts and will tend 
to be operating with minimal support. Though I have always felt that the 
Tigresses could have used 50 or so 400 ton SBDs each rather than their 
300 heavy fighters.

I have found the current (and the last series) of fighter posts to be 
useful and informative. I would also welcome more views on the roles of 
Traveller naval units and hence their required performance.

Along these lines, and in line with the Star Wars mention Fred
made earlier:

The Death Star from Star Wars, according to West End Games\'
_Death Star Technical Manual_, carries a flotilla of _Strike Cruisers_
in addition to it\'s hundred or so T.I.E. fighter wings. Not to mention
some pretty big transport ships.

I kind of like the idea of carrying gunboat flotillas aboard these
really big dreadnaughts, give them a real Space Control capability.

During preparation of an adventure for a Con, I began to think about underwater
combat, as a lot of the adventure will take place under water.

How does the different Traveller weapons perform under water?

Let\'s assume for the purpose of this investigation that all weapons are built
sturdily and capable of tolerating water (i.e. electronics will not be damaged,
etc.)

Slug throwers powered by chemical explosions: I should think that it would be
possible to construct such a weapon in a way that the gunpowder does not get
wet, but apart from that, would it be able to fire? Or does the explosion still
need air? Even if it can fire, I realize that speed of the bullet will drop
much faster than when shooting in air, but how much?

Gauss weapons: I suspect that these would work rather well under water,
although the needles would also loose speed rather rapidly.

Energy weapons: What happens when you fire a laser weapon under water? I would
think that the beam does not get very far, as the energy is absorbed by the
water; but how quickly does this happen? Will it heat up the water so much
that it could become harmful to the firer? Will it heat up so fast that an
explosion-like effect will be the result?

And what about plasma and fusion weapons? The plasma shouldn\'t get very far
through the water, but it\'s very hot. What happens? My feeling is that this
could get pretty messy.

Any comments and/or answers will be greatly appreciated.

IMTU, it is the basis/backing of the imperial currency. It also used to be
used in jump drives, before the doped lanthanum coils/grids. The symbolism,
therefore, become "I\'m so weathly I can WASTE the makings of Jump Drives."

Sorry, but serfdom was a status of unfree person TIED TO THE LAND. They
could Not leave. At lest in feudal brittain and imperial russia. Yes, they
had some rights. THey could own properties other than "real properties"
(like horses, land, and buildings). They could determine, in some cases,
their local law enforcement. They could have and spend money. In order to
leave, they became outlaws until they had lived in a city for a year and a
day (brittain). If the property was sold, they were required to stay put,
unless they were household serfs (russia).

Serfs caught off the lands they were bound to could be whipped, tortured,
or even executed, depending upon time and place. sounds like it fairly well
fits the company store approach....

HOWEVER, at least IMTU, serfdom is safely ignored when it occurs on a
world, and is not extended off that world.

	Great minds think alike. IMTU, it works like so:

The local noble\'s feif is generally the starport. Any local crime could be
appealed to him. His court hears ALL imperial crimes occuring outside the
authorityy of the local world that are tried here. The Noble himself only
hears appeals; his magistrates (whom he appoints) here the trials.

He can bounce appeals up to the subsector duke. They cannot be taken that
far by the convicted individual lest they be nobles.

The Subsector Duke has a trial court for crimes against the imperium, and
for crimes by nobles. THe sector duke himself hears appeals from both his
court, and for appeals by nobles of lesser courts, and for appeals sent him
by a local noble.

At the Sector level, should a trial be needed, it shall be before the moot.
The Sector Duke hears appeals to subsector court ruleings, or nobles
appeals to judgements from any level.

The domain level works just like sector, only slower.

The final layer is the Imperial See, including the moot for trials and the
Emperor as final appeal.

IMOJ, IMTU, is the fact finding and Law Enforcement Bureacracy. Almost all
magistrates of Imperial (read noblemen\'s) courts are drawn from IMOJ. IMOJ
also has a magisterial system for Civil Servants of the Imperial Will (ie,
you work for the imperial government, in one of the bureacracies), outside
the normal noble chain. The CSMS has limited authority over non civil
servants. And can be appealed to the local subsector duke.

As for as firing, it\'s just like in space, they\'ll work just fine.
The range will be very short.  I think I remember reading that a 45
pistol slug would travel only 5 or 6 meters before losing most of
it\'s power.

>Gauss weapons: I suspect that these would work rather well under

Well, assuming the electronics don\'t short.  The needles might
travel further than slugs, being more hydrodynamic, but they\'re also
lighter, so....?

>Energy weapons: What happens when you fire a laser weapon under

Depends on the frequency.  Beams that would work best underwater
would be in the UV range, and might have to be specially designed
for underwater work.  Shorter range than in atmosphere and problems
with heating the surrounding water, certainly.

A bad way to commit suicide.  I suspect the steam explosion around
the firer would be worse than anything that happens to the intended
target.

I was recently offered an option by my FLGS where they would sell my
Ringworld and Ringworld Companion, and I would get half the proceeds and a
discount in future.

The owner quoted selling a copy last GenCon UK at 140 GBP (ie $210 US) plus
40 GBP for the companion ($60).

I almost gave in to that one.

It\'s in M0 and is the charter for the third Imperium. I believe that Jeff

IIRC UK law *is* precedent driven. At least, that\'s what faded memories of

This is of course just speculation on my part, but...

I always assumed the "Irridium Throne" concept was \'barrowed\' from the fact
that the Emperor\'s Throne depicted by Michael Whelan on the cover of H.
Beam Piper\'s book "Empire" was made of a black metal and that the metal was
likely Irridium.

"Empire" (with the cover in question) was first published in May of 1981. I
don\'t know if this was before or after the first mention of the "Irridium
Throne" in Traveller, but it would be interesting to find out.

Marc Miller asked one (or more) of the lists
about what would likely be on the Imperium\'s founding
document, which was followed by much commentary
about general points vs. specifics, and what
things wouldn\'t be in it because the were enacted later.

I suggested the title "Warrant of Restoration" to Marc,
and Jeff (I think -- fading here, too) did the
hard, messy part of putting the better suggestions into
ersatz officialese.

If he is located locally, he can be influence by the local culture, or
have various pressures placed upon him.

In another system, you either bribe him, or you try to talk him over to
your point of view, both of which are *very* dangerous.

Well, I think one key, *especially* in a technical society is to keep
the vassal/lord ratio fairly small. And to "diversify" somewhat. That
is, you have one relationship for your work, but a different one for
some other aspects of your life. This winds up somewhat resmbling
anarcho-syndicalism. And it means that if you terminate *one*
relationship , you have other aspects of your life unchanged to provide
a buffer.

The bit with keeping the vassal/lord ration small is that this makes
the relationship more personal. Which tends tomake honorable behavior
simpler.

Also, with technology, you can have fuedal "groups" interpenetrating.
Which helps spread the word about the "dishonorable".

One *big* item that comes with making "honor" important is that folks
who try to go by the *l;etter* of an agreement rather than the spirit
will get a bad rep in a hurry.

The thing is, it\'s no different than finding comets. You just take
snapshots, and compare everything in the snapshot with your database.
New items and items that have moved in an unexpected way stick out like
a sore thumb. 

The electronics involved (a decent CCD image array, and a small
computer) cost maybe $2-5k *now*. They\'ll be minor added features on
any decent amatuer telescope in a couple of TLs. By TL12-15, the whole
package from telescope to data link will be cheaper than survielance
cameras are now.

I think it\'s just a case of Miles not getting stuck in as many "no win"

And of course, there\'s the Task Force from Hell:

Fleet elements:
	Admiral Harrington\'s task force
	Dendarii Fleet
	a squadron of Dorsai

Ground elements:
	Falkenberg\'s Legion
	more Dorsai

	Although they don\'t know *exactly where it is, or there\'d be no need
to track it.  Points up the difference between search and track ...
if you know where an object on a ballistic trajectory was yesterday,
you just need to find out how much it\'s moved today. Incidentally,
how well do these tracking telescopes work in daylight? What if I\'m

I think you missed my point.
Mushroom:  Kept in the dark and fed lots of sh*t.

He\'s certainly not psychic, so if your planetary government doesn\'t mention
anything about slavery, how\'s he supposed to find out?  With the clerk offworld,
you don\'t have as big a likelihood of a slave escaping to rat you out (since
slaves don\'t generally have access to ships).

True until the 1960s.  There was an adminitrative judical rule (the
exact name of the law escapes me) that became effective in 1966, IIRC.
It allows the UK courts to diverge from precedent.  I don\'t know enough
about the subsequent application except in what I have seen in UK
Copyright decisions, but at least on paper, the UK courts are no longer
bound by precedent (although there are now a great many overlapping

Sorry, this just doesn\'t work. To begin with; the space junk tracked by
NORAD Spacewatch is mostly
in LEO which is why it can be tracked by such small optical telescopes. The
bits of upper stages,
 dead satellites and so on are generally bright optically, and as they spin
or even just orbit they
 present different facets to the sun. Which all adds up to make them easy
to spot.

Tracking a warship which has non-reflective black surfaces as it comes in
from 100 AU is an
 entirely different matter. To get a targeting solution would require
miliradian accuracy - something
small telescopes aren\'t capable of.

Even ignoring the above - difficulties - with optical tracking systems,
would you REALLY expect
a commander to rely on a system that provides *at best* one-third coverage
on any world with
an atmosphere? For practical purposes the atmospheric dispersion of light
will make telescopic
 tracking systems useless during periods of daylight (which is 2/3rds of
the planetary revolution period).
In short, you can\'t use telescopes during the day.

Reminds me of those WWII films where the green fighter pilot screams:
     "Aaargh!  They\'re attacking out of the sun!"

Of course, you could hide your (larger) telescopes on asteroids or small
satellites - but this just
 gives fleets something to shoot at while coming insystem. Besides, they
couldn\'t provide
secure firing solutions to your meson canons unless THEY were also close by
in the belt.
Hey, maybe  that could be a useful role for your fighters - ferreting out
camouflaged observation
 posts and meson canons in asteroid fields. Hmm.

from JTAS 24 when preparing the Hinterworlds for Challenge 39.  The Dynchia
Comitia became the \'Council of Leh Perash\' in the Hinterworlds  supplement.
 As it mentions in the article on the Dynchia, the Atlas of the Imperium
was not consulted when writing the article, and neither was the K\'kree
Alien Module, which gave the correct names for Hinterworlds and Leonidae
(Margin and Melande in the Dynchia article).  I just wish that Peter
Rasmussen had checked these two sources for names and other info, because I
think the Dynchia was one of the best written and useful of all of the
Contact series in JTAS.

Iridium *dust* may be black. But in bulk form, it looks silvery.

Cartridges are *already* airtight and water tight. You\'d have tio go
fairly deep before you had to worry about water getting to the powder.
There\'s neither space not time for air to get into a cartidge *during*
firing. The reaction is entirely self contained.

So common firearms will work in anything from vacuum to underwater.

If it\'s powerful enough to actually *damage* a person, firing it
underwater will result in a steam explosion at the "muzzle".

It\'d be fatal to the firer.

For *any* sort of energy weapon, all the energy is going to get dumped
into the water within a meter or so of the muzzle. And that superheated
water/steam is *not* going to be healthy to be around. 

You also don\'t want to use grenades. The concussion will be *nasty*.

Ultrasound based weapons *may work. But you are basicly stuck with
short range projectile weapons and *trying* to use melee weapons. For
long range, it\'s torpedoes.

  I\'m not sure about limits here, but explosively propelled rounds may very
well have _serious_ problems with chamber pressures if there\'s water in the
barrel. OTOH, an ARL (/Gyrojet) shell might work OK, especially if the load

Depends. If the ships are using HEPlar, they\'ll do pretty well. :-)

I also have to wonder about passive radio frequency tracking.

And it just occured to me that even in daylight, firing a weapon at the
ground (other than meson weapons) will show up pretty well too.

Remember, we are talking about *millions* of these scopes. Therefore
comparing the snapshots from several scopes gves you an *instant*
position fix. 

And they are *civilian* gear, they just switch from tracking comets and
spacraft as a hobby during peacetime to being civilian observers during
wartime. 

To take them out, you\'ll have to raze the cities. Not a good thing.

We weren\'t talking about racking ships that far out. We were talking
about target aquistion for deep meson sites, primarily against the
ships in orbit of the planet which are tyrying to find said meson site.

As a backup, *passive* system for a series of deep meson sites, it
works just fine. It restricts the enemy\'s movements *severely*. They
can\'t put anything in an orbit that is visible from nightside without
risking fire from the meson sites. 

As others have noted, active sensors won\'t last long once the enemy is
in orbit. But passive optical and IR systems can at seriously
inconvenience the enemy while remaining hard to take out.

Passive RF tends to require antennas large enough to be easily spotted,
but I wouldn\'t even rule out those. Is it possible to create sensors
that can record EM fluctuations well enough to synthesize the reading
from a bunch of them into waveform info (sort of the inverse of a
phased array radar). 

If it is, then you can scatter a *lot* of those sensors around (say one
on every telephone pole equivalent) and reconstruct the waveform of any
radio opr radio signals sufficiently well to have at least a *rough*
idea of where to shoot.

This sort of thing isn\'t all that different from an attack sub relying
on *passive* sonar. Sure, it takes time and luck to localize the
target, but you can do so *without* revealing yourself to *their*
sonar.

I am not sure about this, but I think I remember a reference to \'Iridium
throne\' in a sci-fi book earlier than Traveller. 
\'Foundation\' (or some sequel) springs to mind, but it has been some time
since I last read them.
At least \'Emperor Cleon\' is from Foundation books...

  I suspect that most of us got that one, although its\' accuracy is highly
debatable. Human Intelligence is unreliable and inadequate for military
purposes, but almost ideal for law enforcement looking for subjects worthy
of detailed investigation (unless you have a fairly cynical view of the
future of telecommunications and eavesdropping).

  Wouldn\'t visitors have access to ships? Like maybe visiting merchants,
tourists, or Imperial personnel of various sorts? Unless you\'ve got a
totalitarian hermit state all it takes is one person who has a problem
with your social system to report it to make your situation untenable.
They might ignore the first 500 rumours, they might not. This also supposes
that not a single local dislikes the situation, including immigrants and
off-world personnel (businessmen, Imperial agents, TAS/TNS staff).

  One has to wonder if the local nobility dare to send their children off-
world, even for Imperial service. What might someone who\'s spent 20 years
in Imperial service say about effective slavery when they come home and
take a fresh look at things?

  If they do investigate and find something unacceptable they\'re going
to be at least tempted to make an example of someone, particularly if
they determine that efforts to hide the system have occurred (which
just screams "we _know_ what we\'re doing is a serious crime").

  The 3I may not believe in genocide, but they may very well believe
in making examples of people (or peoples).

A couple of unusual current world weapons for underwater combat.

Russian Shkval rocket torpedo.
The first model came out in 1977. It is a cone-shaped rocket torpedo
developed by the Russians to combat superior. Basically the Russians
expected to be ambushed by quieter Western subs. The first indication a
Russian sub driver would get is the noise of approaching Western torpedoes.
The Shkval would be fired at bearing only launch and use a nuclear warhead
to allow for aiming errors. Performance is 200 knots to 12000 yards.
Follow-on designs offer conventional warheads with slow speed acoustic
search at 60 knots followed by a 300 knot attack speed. This is a submarine
or SDB weapon. I\'d imagine by Traveller times some form of common missile
for space and water combat would exist, especially for SDB.

Italian A202 bazooka fired torpedo
Ordered in 1996 for Italian navy special forces. A 16 kilogram mini-torpedo
fired from a bazooka (I think the system is called Medusa). The warhead is
5 kg, speed is 18 knots for 3 minutes. Useful for attacking targets without
having to swim up to them. Also handy to avoid enemy dolphin-type sentries.
Imagine a Medusa firing a Shkval!

Lastly the US Navy is studying the use of directed sound waves to destroy
incoming torpedoes.

IMTU the MoJ agents are an elite force; that mitigates against the chance
of bribing one (though it does happen, of course). Think of a cross between
a Federal Marshal and a Texas Ranger. The agents are chronically overworked
and usually work singly and in pairs with at least one agent on any world
with a population over a few hundred - more on high-population worlds, of
course. Agents are required to file reports regularily. Each subsector also
has a few MoJ teams: 6-8 highly experienced agents working together. If an
agent goes missing. a full team goes looking for him (And if they go missing
too, the next step is a Special Investigator armed with an Imperial Warrant
and backed by a borrowed IN task force). It is generally considered bad
luck to kill a MoJ agent...

I\'ve been toying with the idea of running a campaign where the players are
the members of such a MoJ team.

The connections to the Island Clusters are in TNE\'s "Regency Sourcebook".
By the period shown (1200), the Regency has established a couple of free-space
refuelling/"calibration points" to reduce the travel to Jump-5 or so (though
it\'s still a haul.)

They probably didn\'t have radio communication with the Imperium. A favourite
TML conspiracy theory is that the ESA long-range colonization mission was 
sent because the ESA had some hints of the existence of the Vilani
(crashed Vilani scoutship at Roswell for the extreme conspiracy types, 
interferometer and radio observations of Barnard\'s star for the non-conspiracy
types) and was trying to send out a branch of Terran humanity far enough to
be safe if Terra got invaded.  That explains why they picked such distant
and isolated stars. The colonists might have historical records telling them
to avoid communication...and would have been *really* unhappy when the
Imperium arrived.

I believe most NORAD detection of new debris (which generally works down
to about 10cm diameter) is done via radar, not visible-light, though i coudl
be wrong. 

A 1-m telescope can detect a Military Black warship out to perhaps 50,000 km.
(It\'s TL-12 equivalent would be about 30cm in diameter and weigh about 100kg.) 
That\'s not the same as being able to provide a fire control solution good enough
to fire a meson weapon, though - it could probably only do fire-control quality
tracking out to 500 km or less, which is somewhat inadequate.

I forgot about that. Combined with reduced IR sensitivity (warm telescope
and warm sky), it would require quite large ground-based passive sensors - 
maybe a PEMS-15 - to hit a warship that was ~15,000 km out on the daylight
side. Sensors that big are easy to find and destroy. A PEMS-13 - which is 
small enough to hide - could be used for initial detection, and the 
defenders would then have to depend on active sensors - lots of cheap
expendable LIDARs and radards - for fire control. There would be an active
dual to pick off these LIDARs as they light up, before they can get a solution
for the deep meson sites.

The other important sensors would be orbital - a PEMS-12.5 or 13 in a 
satellite would be enough for fire control. Most developed worlds would
probably have dozens or hundreds of little fire control sensors hidden on 
apparently-junk satellites. And, as previously noted, if they had a moon,
they\'d carpet it with cheap optical/IR sensors.

There were three (?) editions of D3eities nad Demigods (sometimes Legends
and Lore)

One had Cthulu and Nehwon (sp?) Mythos, one had just Nehwon, and the latest
had neither.  The Cthulu was only in the first printing(s).

When you get your out, check for Cthulu.  If its not there, put it back in
the attic for antoher 10 years or so, otherwise bounce over to
rec.games.rpg.marketplace and make a mint (assuming it is \'mint\' condition).

Oh, and while you\'re in the attic, look for the series of AD&D modules
starting with G1, G2, and G3, D1-2, D3, and ending in Q1 "Queen of the
Demonweb Pits".  If you have them all (they were all sold seperately, or in
2-3 packages) and they are the original versions in very good+ condition,
you can get good money for them.  I thought I had them all, only to realize
I lent out Q1 when I was in college (like, 10 years ago) and never got it
back...grrr.

  {
    'body' => '	I had another idea for uses of fighters and other patrol craft.  
One of the big arguments against them is that all a navy has to control 
is the 100-d limit of the mainworld.  Since for most worlds the 100-d 
limit is almost within weapons range of a ship in orbit, there\'s really 
no reason to have scouting vessels like fighters or gunboats.  I\'ve 
agreed with this point of view until I started thinking about it in more 
detail.
	The problem is that an attacking fleet will very likely _not_ 
jump in right at the 100-d limit and start shooting because all of the 
ships in the fleet will be arriving at different times.  In a poorly 
executed jump, ships could be coming in over a two day time span.  Since 
having your fleet arrive on the battlefield in dribs and drabs invites 
defeat in detail, fleets will want to jump into a "rally" point somewhere 
outside the 100-d limit of the mainworld.  This represents an opportunity 
for the defender to keep his system well patrolled so that when advance 
elements of the enemy fleet start arriving they can be picked off before 
they can get organized.
	Since we have t-plates in Traveller again, I think gas giants 
will be more attractive places to begin an assault on the mainworld 
since they give the attacker a place to organize, refuel, and do some 
long-range sensor examination of the defender\'s forces.  A trip from GG 
to mainworld at 4-6G continous accel probably will not take more time 
than a micro-jump but will allow the attacker to continously monitor the 
situation on the mainworld and avoid the need to once again rally after 
the jump.  This makes battles in interplanetary space more likely and 
offers lots of exciting possibilities such as spreading missile

I received a call from the local used book store guy.  Someone cleaned 
out their closet and had some Classic Traveller stuff they gave him.  I 
went to look at it yesterday.  Unfortunately (or fortunately for you) I 
have almost all that he had for sale.  So, I pass on the list to you.  I 
will be happy to pick up anything that you want and will send it to you 
for whatever the cost plus postage is.  

Everything was in very good condition.

"The List"

CT Books 4 and 5:  $4 each

Supplements 1,4, 6-12  $4 each

Adventure 1, Kinunir, $4

Journals 2, 5-16 (I might have missed #4 but not sure)  He\'s asking $6 
for each journal 2-10, and $5 for the journals numbered 11 and up.

"FCI Consumer Guide" from FASA (probably $5 or $6)

Let me know if you want anything, and I can get it this afternoon or
tomorrow.

And since any society that uses imprisonment *at all* has to make an
exception anti-slavery laws that allows involuntary servitude as a
punishment, it might be *really* tempting to sentence the examples to
"life at hard labor" on the sector hellhole\'s terraforming project or
some such.

Talk about "the punishment fitting the crime"!

BTW, it just occured to me that I don\'t recall anything that would
indicate that the Imperium has a prohibition on "cruel and unusual
punishment". And given the *variety* of societies involved, I\'m not
sure it *could* have such. 

This opens up a whole \'nother set of ways to both discourage crimes and
to get across to players the "you\'re not in Kansas anymore" feeling.

"What happened to Charlie?! I thought they had him in custody for that
fight in the bar."

"They did. Since he started the fight and then broke one guy\'s arm and
knocked out a couple of some other guy\'s teeth, the judge sentenced him
to the same..."

Hey, with high TL medical treatment, it\'s a reasonable punishment.
They give you the same discomfort you gave out, then let you think
about it for a while before sending you off to a doctor. In the
spacer\'s case they saw no reason to waste their money treating him,
they just sent him back to his ship to be treated by the ship\'s doctor
(and to clue in his crewmates that they should read the fine print in
the Imperial encylopedia entry for the world)

Great way to hint that you *don\'t* want to be caught *starting* trouble
on that world. Especially since even an idiot can figure out what the
penalty for murder is... :-)

I\'ll note for the record that I don\'t think Kim Kinisson(sp) and the
Galactic patrol can be crammed into the "feel" of Traveller. I\'m not
sure about the Petit Harriers, as the only story about them I\'vbe read
was by David Drake, who by his own admission went off on a bit of a
tangent from the concept.

I suppose Commodore Grimes and his wife Sonya could be fit in there

Flandry (with Anderson\'s permission)).

Not "Game over, man! Game Over!".

For a slightly less military situation, you could always find that your
"great trade opportunity" has yu up against a ship from "Solar Spice &
Liquors" (GMs choice whether it\'s Nick van Rijn himself, or David
Falkayn and crew)

And for the *personal* touch, we\'ve got folks like Jason dinAlt, or
Slippery Jim diGriz (and family).

No wonder US doctrine was to run the torpedoes out quietly on a *big*
dogleg. That way when you launch at the source of the highspeed run,
you aren\'t aiming anywhere *near* the actual sub that launched it.

BTW, TL differences can make for interesting situations. Say a
balkanized world is at about WWII TL. There\'s a war going on, with
convoys, wolfpacks, the whole bit. They\'ve only recently been contacted
and little tech has gotten imported yet.

Now some helpful person imports a 688 class sub for one side. Here\'s
this "unguarded" convoy sailing along. And as the enemy subs approach
they all get knocked off with no warning and out of range. :-)

Depends on the size of the blast, and depth of the blast (and gravity

The agents need a lot of backing from desk types. Heck, consider the
CIA, they need more folks to process data from their various sources
(including agents in place) than people to *gather* it. They\'ve just
taken it a bit *too* far, with not enough people on the ground.

Also, the type of agents you are describing above are *not* the agents
I just described. They are "covert ops" rather than "intelligence". Two
*very* different jobs. Different enough that I agree with a suggestion
made some years back that we should take the covert ops types *out* of
the CIA (and a few other agencies) and lump them together in a
reincarnated OSS (Office of Strategic Services). 

Though I do note that it would appear that your agents aren\'t
*necessarily* covert. So the analogies are a bit strained.

True enough, but they don\'t have to worry about the "debris" shooting

Since when is 30 cm equivalent to 1 m? :-)
(I do know what you mean, but I\'d say 50 cm to 1 m is a better idea
even at TL12)

Don\'t you get any improvement from using dozens of scopes (all with
precisely known locations)? Especially spread out over hundreds of
miles?

I get the impression that their government is just modified and
extended herd dynamics. (Someone got their ethology right!)

So you have a herd/family as the basic unit. In such a unit (assuming
horselike ethology) there\'s the lead stallion, and a lead mare. The
lead mare provides the stability, whereas the lead stallion is likely
to get challenged by indepedent males wanting a herd of their own.

Groups of herds have their leads "fight" it out to determine a "lord".
The lords fight it out to determine the Steppelord. And the steppelords
of the various planets determine the ???? (I forget the term, it\'s the
ruler of K\'kree space). 

Much of this is based on "dominance" (sort of like "attitude"). But
actual fighting will occur. And as I vaguely recall from what little I
have read on such things, herbivore dominance fights tend to get a
*lot* uglier, because once the challenge is given the normal
"submission" signals go out the window. 

This may be why the K\'kree can\'t see any middle ground between "make
them vegetarians" and "exterminate them". 

Niven & Pournelle\'s "Footfall" deals with *some* of these issues, but
their model was *elephants* who have mixed sex herds. Horses (the
apparent model for the K\'kree) don\'t tolerate adult males other than
the lead stallion (as I recall). So the rules are different. Such as
"submission" being a lot less common. Fights between stallions are
*bloody*, whereas fights between wolves for pack leader often result in
almost no injuries.

Gordon R. Dickson\'s earlier books made a lot of use of the idea of
alien cultures based around the "social rules" (ethology) of various
animals. One book had a society based on Bears. And then there was the
one that was essentially human society except that the prime rule for
behaviour wasn\'t "is this the right thing to do?" but "is this the
proper thing to do?" The consequences of that major difference are
*huge*. He also had a couple of books where the aliens merely used
existing *human* social systems. Just not the ones we are familiar with
from Western Europe *or* those of China and Japan. 

Anthro texts are *good* references for GMs trying to design races and
cultures. Ditto for the texts on animal societies. 

I ought to try seeing if it\'s possible to get what most agree is *the*
single most alien human culture on the planet to work in a
technological society. The basic "idea" is that once you are past
childhood, you trust *no one*. You assume that everyone is out to get
you. It\'s a *very* strange culture. Yet outsiders are treated well.
Since they so obiously *trust* other people, they are *obviously*
crazy, and being crazy, they are exempt from the rules and treated
decently. 

I think I can see them as a technical society. It\'d take some
handwaving to get them from primitive society to technical one though.
Probably have to assume some "helpful" traders. 

I\'m not sure that they *could* join the Imperium. But they probably
wouldn\'t object to being surrounded by it. And I have this feeling that
a lot of *freelance* covert ops types would be from there. There\'s no
way any organization would be trusted by them enough for them to join.
But with "adequate" safeguards they could pull off jobs for them.

See my other post. I suspect that much of the K\'kree social structure
is based on "instinct" far more than with humans (though our societies
are more instinct based than many want to admit)

The Melnibonean mythos was also yanked after the first printing.  Chaosium
had the rights to both Cthulu and Elric, and jumped all over TSR when they
published Dieties & Demigods.  TSR owned the rights to the Newhon (Fafhrd &
Gray Mouser) mythos, and published several supplements for it.  I never saw
a third edition printing without Newhon (Had gotten away fronm D&D by that
time).  The first edition of Dieties and Demigods is the only AD&D book I
still own, because it is valuable.

About Ringworld & Ringworld companion, if you know of anyone interested in
it I have both (especially at that price).  The box for Ringworld is torn a
little, and the dice are missing (like a gamer won\'t have dice), but
otherwise everything is there and in good condition, right down to the
registration card.

Leonard, who is coordinating this effort and what data transmission system
are they using to pump all this data into ONE dBase.  I would be willing to
bet that there are no more than 3 or 4 telescopes (at our technology level)
that are working the issue at the same time.  The delay between data being
received and then "analized" (spelling on purpose) is several days at best.
From what I can remember, the telescopes are looking at very specific points
in the sky and take a series of pictures. Then a few hours later they take
more pictures and run a "visual" comparison first and a computer generated
comparison some time later to help determine anomalies.
Given that, you have the next problem of lack of resources.  There just
aren\'t enough people or computers dedicated to this or any other
"intelligence" project to give timely input.  This has nothing to do with
the number of telescopes working it, I\'ll even concede that you could have
your million telescopes.  You could have collected all the intelligence that
was available and not see the results in some cases for years because the
amount of data is so overwhelming.  This probably would be true for even
10 - 15 telescopes.

Presently we are just discussing telescopes, consider radar, ir, low light,
laser transmission and a myriad of other "sources" for input to your dBase
and you can see where there might be an overwhelming amount of data just
dying to get into the right persons hands but unfortunately just don\'t get
noticed.  There are of course "triggers" assigned to specific conditions
that we hope will help us pull up truly relevant data but remember, these
were written into a program by (hopefully) gifted people.  You just can\'t
cover all contingencies and the amount of stuff that slips thru unnoticed is
staggering.  That brings us finally to the real problem, the human element.
After its all said and done it is left to a couple of people that have had
some extraordinary training (see programmers above too) but have been on the
project for years and seen countless false positives.  They just might miss
it even if they looked right at it.

Ships/asteroids/comets could come in from blind spots, and there are some,
to wreak havoc on us poor Solomanies.  IMNSHO, there is just as a good a
chance of not being seen as there is to being seen.

I did some calculations (when the last piracy disscussion came around) on
T-plate in system travel times, and got this chart for the average time
from Earth to Jupiter using T-plates for constant acceleration:

Time to Jupiter (with turn around)
Acc (G\'s) 1      2      3      4      5      6      10     20     30
Seconds   557960 394537 322138 278980 249527 227786 176442 124763 101869
Days      6.5d   4.6d   3.7d   3.2d   2.9d   2.6d   2.0d     1.4d   1.2d

As you can see even a free trader will take less time than a micro-jump
normally takes. In fact lokking at these times IMO an attacking fleet can\'t
afford to emerge closer than this, unless their commander is sure that he
has properly coordinated his fleets jump, because otherwise the defenders
could arrive before the last of his fleet did. This means that for those
little red dwarf systems an invader is going to be quite a long way from
anything in the system.

I\'ve pretty much always assumed that this is how things would be done in a
T-plate universe, largely because I can\'t see how you can avoid producing a
thumping great gravity pulse when you emerge from jump. Besides IMTU a fair
chunk of the jump fuel is used as a \'jump bubble\', and this also emerges
from jump with you, and is fairly hot so all in all hiding a jump emergence
is damned hard if there\'s anyone looking for you. This means that it is
essential to be far enough away from the defence that they can\'t get to you
before you can get it together. However looking at the travel times I think
that most GGs will be too close to the main world to be of much use. As I\'m
not a beliver in fighters the patrols would normally be SDBs, which have
the adventage of maybe lasting a little longer and having a better
endurance. The other likely scout IMTU would be a Midu or equivilent, for
their more complete sensor suite, placed a long way out to extend the
defence\'s sensor reach.

It can be done, but you must get ALL the gas out of the barrel. Apparently
burst barrels are caused by the inability of gas in front of the bullet to
escape fast enough. I\'ve seen a rilfe that someone had benn using to shoot
fish. He had accidentally put the muzzle underwater, and as a result burst
the barrel. The barrel had burst about an inch back from where the water
level was.

A while back _Guns & Ammo_ magazine did an arctile on underwater firing of
guns. They got into a swimming pool with an assortment of handguns and
fired them. IIRC none of them blew up, and the bullets went 10 - 20 feet
before running out of steam.

	Position fixes are fine ... once you know something is there and
approximately where it is, so you can correlate *this* anomalous
speck of light from this telescope with *that* anomalous speck of
light from that telescope. And the original detection, from my
understanding, takes a while. You take a photo tonight. Tomorrow
night you take another photo, and again, and again. Then you look for
specks of light which seem to move from night to night.

	OK. I jump into your system (in my ultrablack hulls ...), and take
up orbits which keep me on your sunlit side, so you telescopes are
worthless. Then I start pounding you.

	Or I change my vector each time I pass over on the sunside, where
you can\'t see me. Now you can\'t correlate targets from pass to pass,
so you can\'t compare different telescopes\' images.

	Meanwhile, I\'m jamming the hades out of your planet, and I\'ve
already taken out major hardline comm nexi with pinpoint strikes--how
are you even going to get data from multiple scopes together? Are you
really going to have millions of meson comms?

	Why, just as far as a conventional explosive shock wave, of course!
More seriously, I\'m fairly certain shock waves follow 1/r^2 just like
most other expanding wavefronts.

Concussion wavefronts aren\'t 1/r^2 (overpressure is usually 1/r^3, and its
usually overpressure which determines damage).  As water is mostly
incompressible, I\'m not sure how it will be affected; it probably actually
depends on the depth of the local water, since it is likely to create
conventional waves as well as compression waves.  In any case it will drop
faster than 1/r^2, because shockwaves travelling through a medium always waste
some energy heating up and/or decomposing the medium through which they pass.

It\'s a shame!  There are so many interesting games and game
supplements out there, but being \'out of print\' they become rare and
too expensive for people to do anything but collect them.  It\'s too
bad we can\'t find a way to keep all these things available.

  A8 Prison Planet had a sort of nice take on things, if you looked at
it right. There you are, slaving away (pardon the expression) doing what
could be done hundreds of times faster with powered machinery, at great
pain and risk. It goes a long way towards reminding you that your society
has determined that you are a liability, and worth almost nothing.

  Perhaps for Imperial military personnel who really screw up they can
at least hope for the option of being punished in a fashion that allows
them to do something useful - salvage crew, mine-clearing, security work
on a real pesthole; unrealistic, perhaps, but an interesting source for
adventures or character background.

Firstly let me say the new version is well worth the wait. However I found some 
specific issues when I converted a number of my existing sectors. Firstly after 
running the converter you need to go into the sector.dat file and strip out the 
"adacent sectors" (the bits that go <north>, <south> etc). If you don\'t galatic 
will see these as the first four subsectors and the blank line as the fifth (I 
suspect that there can only be one blank line between the sector header and 
the subsectors). Second you need to go into the sector.mnu file (in the gen 
directory) and the data.mnu file (in the maps directory) and add "gals/" to the 
file directory tree (it looks like "@dir=gals\\Intwars\\1stcont\\gen"). Other than 
those minor point everything seems to run brillantly.

Well, what you say is essentially true.  But I don\'t think its a choice,
really.
The Operations Branch of the CIA is perennially understaffed and is
almost
always recruiting.  The main problem is lack of personnel with necessary

language skills, aptitude for the job and a willingness to work covertly

recruiting foreign national agents to give desired information.  An
apparently
rare combination.  The initial examination as part of the CIA
application process
is an all day standardized test of basic skills, world
politicial/social/cultural
knowledge and, somewhat surprisingly, two separate lengthy psych profile

questionaires (reminds me of The Parallax View with Warren Beaty - a
good
rental if you like Kennedy-Oswaldesque conspiracy plots).

Nah, promote \'em instead.  But promote \'em to Coreward or Spinward deep
scout missions,or particularly hazardous duty, such as testing new jump
drives, investigating ancient sites
on extreme hostile envirnoment planets.  You know, jobs where 90% of the

fail and die, 9% of the time they will succeed and die, and 1% of the

Why is it cracy? If the cost depends on distance and the time depend on
distance wouldn\'t this give us that the total cost (given that time =
money) wouldn\'t this give us distance squared?`

BTW A big me too for getting quotes, URLs, books etc for the "gravity model".

I don\'t see it.

Let\'s see...  There would be *heavy* wind currents in the upper atmosphere of a GG.  Probably on the order of hundreds of klicks per hour.  Don\'t quote me on it, it\'s been about 25 years since I\'ve studied any kind of physics.

What does military ranking systems have to do with historical models of a
society?

OK, lets say the US actually resemble the Imperium a lot, then:

The US allow their states (or more likely their individual counties/cities)
to have from anarchy to police states, communistic, capitalistic or
whatever without interference from washington. The federal government of
USA allows small scale wars to be fought inside single cities as long as
the intracity trade is not hampered etc (one could argue that these are
gangwars in say LA and that the federal government actually allow them :-).
The president rules supremely and the congress/senate etc can only do one
thing: dissolve the government.

If the above description fits the USA and/or russia then your claim is true
but if the only resemblance with historical fact is the name of ranks etc
then I don\'t see any resemblance.

Its a hard to find metal on earth but abundant in asteroids. Marc et al
probably thought it would give an SF feel with an asteroid metal replacing
gold, silver etc. I don\'t think much thought was put into it as anyone can
see that a metal that is scarce on planets but plentiful in space would
only be valuable on planets. Thus an Iridium throne would signify an empire
that hadn\'t been in space for very long and still valued metals etc by
planetary scarcity.

Just my 0.02 Cr.

OT: The main reason paleontologists think an asteroid killed the dinos is
due to an everpresent line of iridium in the sediment with the same age as
when the dinos died out.

If you are doing convoy defense, a 688 is waaaaay overkill (and far too big
to import IMO). You\'d be a lot better off with, say, half a dozen air/rafts
or helos with dipping sonars, plus a couple of Salmons or similar towed
sonars for your frigates. If the hi-tech units report where the subs are,
then the lo-tech units can do the killing.

I believe that "decimation" originated with the Roman legions. It was
the punishment for a unit that mutinied. The idea was that since who
would get executed wasn\'t forseeable, you had a *strong* incentive to
turn in any would-be mutineers.

You can use snapshots over much *shorter* intervals too. For one thing,
any *new* object will stick out immediately. And it won\'t take a
computer long to take the list of "new anomalies" from several scopes
and convert the relative bearings into 3d position maps.

Well, until you get close enough to take them out, the *active*
sensors, as well as the passive orbital sensor packages, are going to
be telling me enough to chew you up a lot.

It\'s only after youve knocked those out that "stealthy" sensors on the
ground start to look good.

You can correlate the images from the *same* pass, if you have good
positions for the scopes. Which means that shortly after you cross the
terminator, you are in danger of being terminated. :-)

And all those course changes eat up not only *power* (and fuel in some
cases), but they also eat computer time (making sure everyone is in
orbits that don\'t interesect) and comm bandwidth (trying to distribute
the courses).

That\'s exactly the sort of situation the packet networks such as the
Internet were *designed* for! To keep carrying communications reliably
with large holes chopped in the net.

No.

Taking a dton of cargo a parsec costs about Cr 900. 2 parsecs cost about Cr
1300. 3 parsecs cost about Cr 1750 (ref Hans\' Passenger and Freight table).
In all cases, it takes about 10 days per jump.

Now, look at a cargo going 8 parsecs. Assuming \'normal\' distribution of
refuelling points, it should take 3 jump 3s. The cost of this is therefore
Cr 5250. Time is thirty days or so.

This is a lot less than distance squared times cost of a jump one, or Cr 57
600.

Now, a cargo will cost money to hold for the extra 20 days, but even at a
phenominal ten megacredits per dton and 5% interest, the 20 days only add
KCr 28 or so to the total cost (and thus make it well worth using a jump-5
freighter).

I agree (totally and humbly) and wonder only; where can I find "Hans\'
Passenger and Freight table" as this surely seems a handy reference when
calculating what kinds of ships there are given a certain TL.

Run on battery power/flywheel etc and scan with neutrino scanners. That is

batteries/flywheels etc cannot run the gravplates for long.

No, that\'s because the atmosphere thickness is so small compared to radius.
The mass of atmosphere at say 1000 atms or less is totally inconsequental.

>Pressures go up fairly fast. I don\'t recall what temperatures do.

The pressure increase goes up in proportion to gravity times average
molecular wight of gasgiant atmosphere. When I had my PCs dipping really
deep into a GG I worked it out and to my surprise the pressure doesn\'t
increase much faster than on earth as the higher gravity is counteracted by
the lower average molecular mass of the gas. I\'ll dig up my calculations if
anybody e-mail me directly.

Not if the ship has CG.

Lawyers today speak a language designed solely to force us hiring them to

Hm.  Our equivalent quote is "Characteristic look and feel."
Shorthand for the memorable quote "This has the characteristic look
and feel of a complete fiasco."

In my games, I\'ve heard that phrase both at planning time, meaning
"this plan is way to complex and unworkable" or "we\'re doomed", and at
execution time, meaning "this isn\'t working" and "we\'re doomed."

Given the strong personalities in the \'Task Force from Hell\' I would
put it on the players\' side.  Then you can give them huge shocks as
their task force breaks up and starts sniping at each other.  After
all, in _each_ of those examples politics plays a big part.

Hmmm.  Let\'s see.  Harrington can insist on defending this convoy,
trading a large military exchange which could otherwise been fought on
favorable terms for the lives of the convoyed ships (Solar Spice and
Liquors, of course).  Meanwhile, the Dendarii will split up, leaving
some units around the planet you just left to rescue a relative.  The
rescue will fail, because Slippery Jim deGriz has already spirited the
relative away in a fast ship -- probably at a prearranged rondezvous
with Harrington.  However, in the rescue attempt, the Slammers will
"accidentally" topple the government, placing Miles on the throne
(kicking and screaming all the way) because it\'s the expedient way to
marshall the planet\'s resources to carry out the search for the lost
relative.

That\'d give the PCs plenty to deal with, and I haven\'t even talked
about the Dorsai or Falkenberg\'s Legion because I\'m not familiar with
the books.

  I\'d thought of something like that. You can also deal with profoundly
irritating regimes (e.g. de-nazification, the Khmer Rouge, Ba\'ath Socialist
Party) by trouncing them on the battlefield and then lining them up by rank
on their membership list ("why thank you, young man, here\'s an amnesty and
Cr 1,000,000..."). Do that sort of thing as necessary and locals will simply
block out dumb ideas like holding off-worlders hostage or massacring their
political opponents grass-roots supporters en masse.

  Of course, killing the political oppositions\' leadership could be a
protected cultural activity, just like in the Imperium :)

Falkenberg\'s Legion is primarily a light infantry unit, every bit as
specialized (and dangerous) as the Slammers - in their field of expertise.
While I can see either unit integrating well with the other, I do not see
either Col. Hammer nor Col. Falkenberg subordinating himself and his unit to
the other.

Now, Falkenberg on one side and Hammer on the other...  8^D

I\'ve an extra copy of that issue, complete with the Hinterworlds insert. If
you\'d like it, I\'d let it go for $8 - and that\'s including the 2-day

	Really? Just off the top of my head, I\'d expect r^2--the energy is
distributed (basically) in a spherical shell; the surface area of the
shell goes as r^2, therefore the (fixed) energy gets spread out as
the shell increases. At least looking at an inviscid, incompressible
fluid, that\'s what I\'d guess ...

	Ahh ... neglected the viscid/compressible aspects of the issue ...

There is actually a way that out of print copyright items can be copied legally. If 
the original author asks the copyright holder to reprint and the copyright holder 
refuses, then the copyright reverts to the author. Its all got to do with the legal 
concept that "ownership" of intellectual property is not transferable (eg you can 
only sell the "rights" to it). This of course gets horribly complicated with 
derivative works (eg supplements) and multiple authors.

Two in fact, although both are secondary sources:

1988, p. 71.

Goodall, Brian, "gravity model", _Dictionary_of_Human_Geography_, p. 198-9,

So authors can force mean, nasty companies to give them back the rights to
their hard earned writings? This will come as news to several people I know.

At least in NZ they can (I\'d assume that since the US also has a common law 
system some similar provision would exist). However I think the coyright holder 
has to give an absolute refusal (I\'m not sure but I think that mean nasty 
companies can get out of it by saying "not now, but we\'ll reconsider in 5 
years").

Well, Andrew, that may be true for New Zealand and the UK (and probably
the EU),
but in the US, that won\'t fly.  In the US, the rights of an original
author of a copyrighted
work completely terminate on transfer of the copyright.  Though the
author may still
have a right of affiliation, i.e., to say that he is the author and for
the work to display that
as well, he has no standing to do anything about anything after the
transfer.

As a general rule, US intellectual property law does not recognise what
are often called
the "moral rights" of authors and inventors of items of intellectual
property.  By contrast,
most European countries do protect these rights, sometimes in very
strange ways.  For
instance, I paint a mural on a wall in my house.  Then I sell you the
house.  I may be able
to prevent you from painting over the mural.  However, if you chose to
destroy the entire
house, I couldn\'t stop you.  Odd, from an American point of view.

The closest the US comes to such things is a recent change provision for
visual graphic
works created and published in very limited print runs.

Sorry to split hairs with you again, Andrew.  The term "common law"
means "judge made" law and it used to distinguish the law found in
written, published court opinions from the laws created by legistlatures
which is also written and published and referred to as "statutory law."
There is no such thing as a common law of copyright in the US, and if my
International Intellectual Property Law Professor was correct, anywhere
among the members to the Bern Treaty on Copyrights.

Of course, the value of a written law is somewhat less important in
countries which do not use a rule of Stare Decisis (The thing decided),
i.e., binding legal precedent, because even though the basic law may be
written down, judges are free to decide the issue as they feel
appropriate.

There is such a thing as "customary law" which is not written down, but
this is generally only used in the context of international law and
still requires proof that X was a custom of such standing and tradition
that it has risen to the level of customary international law.

I don\'t know much about NZ in particular, but I do know some about the
UK and the EU. But its very, very dangerous to assume any similarity on
these kind of issues.  US intellectual property was written long after
the steady accretion of such things in England primarily, and as a
result, is a large comprehensive body of statutory law (actual, its
rather small as US federal laws go).  Especially with regard to
copyrights.  Also, the US system was in many ways a reaction to the
English and/or European systems and has some deliberate choices that are
the opposite of those laws.  The termination of an author\'s rights,
completely, on transfer of copyright and patent and the first-to-invent
system for patent registration, as opposed to first-to-file for most of
the world.

Nope.  WRT US Copyrights.

This stuff is confusing.  Thats why international lawyers make the big
bucks.

And just in case you\'re wondering, I just completed law school with a
heavy concentration of intellectual property law courses.  So at least I
know a little about what I\'m saying.  ;-)

Note 1: The prices above was arrived at by designing a number of 600 T ships
(with QSDS1.5) each dedicated to one kind of passengers, ie. a ship with 1 T
of cargo space per passenger and 1 steward per 8 passengers for High
Passengers, another ship with negligible cargo space and 1 steward per 50
passengers for Middle Passengers, a ship with small staterooms for Economy
Passengers, a ship with Low Berths and 1 medic per 20 berths for Low
Passengers, and a ship with bunks only for Steerage Passengers, plus a ship
with cargo hold only for freight. In all cases, except the ships for Steerage
passengers, the design included emergency medical low berths enough to
accomodate a full complement of crew and passengers.

Note 2: I\'ve used my own rules for life support costs and introduced a
"misjump insurance" based on the value of the ship to compensate. As a
result passenger rates are a bit lower and freight rates a bit higher
than official rules would get you.

Not to contradict what Ian and others have said, but to clarify:

The "gravity model" I cited measures interaction between two points.  That
interaction could be trade, traffic, communication, immigration, or any
number of relationships.  The model is empirically derived - that is, it is
an observation, not a theory.  In the case of Traveller economics, I used
it to  reflect the *demand* for trade between two worlds with given
characteristics, one of which was the distance between them.  Demand is
influenced by a number of factors beyond transportation cost:  type of
goods offered, whether they can be obtained from another source closer to
hand, communications delays in advertising, ordering and payment, etc.  I
abstracted some of these into gross or net "profitability", and left the
rest to the inverse-square relationship.

IMO extradition would be a matter for the individual planetary governments
to decide. There are two factors involved: 1) Does the original planet want
the perpetrator badly enough to pay the expense of tracking him down and
paying to get him back (Which can easily run into serious money)? This
question alone would eliminate a lot of cases. Secondly, does the planet
where the alledged perpetrator is now want to turn him over to the first
planet? This would depend on the nature of the crime, the weight of
evidence, the reputation of the first planet and the mores and customs of
the second planet. 

The Imperium would be able to demand extradition of people charged with
Imperial crimes regardless of the wishes of the planet he is on, but they
would still have to decide whether it is worth the trouble. Just getting
him arrested would be tricky if the planetary authorities decided not to
cooperate.

The problem is that WTH presumes that everybody is involved in primary and
secondary production. There is at least three sectors missing: Service
sector, Administration Sector, and Non-contributing Sector (Criminals,
unemployed, idle rich, etc.). As the society grows bigger these sectors
would all increase significantly.

I\'d love to work out something similar to WBH to describe mainworld
societies, but there\'s so much else to work on...

Well, it\'s a LOT more complicated than that...it all depends, as Loren knows
well, on exactly _what_ rights the author signed away on the dotted line of
the contract.

This is also why, in the fine print of movie and television credits there\'a
always a line like:

"For the purposes of copyright law, Columbia Pictures is the sole author of
this picture"

Mind you, in the case of some of the more schizophrenic megacorps, this could
still lead to years of legal wrangling before the two distant subsidaries
realized they were, in fact, parts of the same company.

Falkenberg\'s Legion is your basic infantry regiment. They\'ve got
artillery, and the like, but they are definitely *infantry*.

The Slammers are armored cavalry. Tanks and mechanized transport for
their infantry. 

They\'ll support each other nicely. And they both have the attitude that
it\'s best to fix the damn problem rather than play politics. I think
Hammer and "Christian Johnny" would like each other.

The Slammers and Falkenberg haveboth been in situations where it was a
choice between survival and orders. And they\'ve been in the position of
being hired to solve an "insoluble" problem. They\'ve been known to
allow people to give orders that can allow them to do what\'s needed and
be "unable to be contacted" when the horrified bureacrats realized that
they were actually going to *carry out* the orders.

And for anyone who thinks the Dorsai haven\'t done their share of this,
I suggest that you listen to the Balld of Jacques Chretien as found in
the story Brothers.

That\'s why both are under either Cletus Graham, or Donal Greame. Since
I think Donal is overkill for this group, we\'ll have Cletus in overall
command.

I really can\'t see Falkenberg *stopping* the Slammers without *very*
favorable terrain and circumstances. But he\'d sure as hell slow them
down and make them *pay* for every inch of ground.

You can do without internal grav comp if the crew is in good shape. 3 g
for Jupiter, only 1 g for Saturn. Other gas giants it depends.

And frankly, I can\'t see anybody having *anything* to do with the *big*
gas giants we\'ve detected out there unless they had no choice. 

The one that comes to mind is that one that\'s 50 times the mass of
jupiter and orbiting a G or F type star at *less* than an AU. If it is
a gas gaint (and not something weird), then it\'ll actually be *smaller*
than jupiter due to the gravity causing more of the core to be
degenerate. 

That means 150-200 g at the top of the atmosphere. With more solar
input than earth gets to drive the atmospheric circulation. Giving you
storms I don\'t even want to *think* about. And even CG won\'t let you
get away from a gravity well like *that*.

The sort of Gas Giants generated by all the world creation systems I\'ve
seen tend to be smaller than Jupiter, so the gravity on a ship "hiding"
in one of them won\'t be a big problem.

Hey! That exlains the odd layout on some of those ships. They\'re
expected to spend a lot of time loitering in GG atmospheres! So the
decks are laid out for that!

Sure, but after they quit getting fooled by the "undefended" convoys,
you then start hunting down their Navy.

And actually, I\'m sure that a 688 will fit into the hold of a medium
sized freighter. You just sinks the freighter, sail the sub over the
hatch into the flooded hold. Submerge, have the sub secured by hawsers
to tiedowns, close the hatch. Then set the internal grav field to keep
things oriented properly in the hold. The "caretaker" crew for the sub
just spends the trip in the sub using it\'s life support.

Much simpler than messing with cradles and all that. It also makes it
easier to unload covertly at the end of the trip.

Hell. It just occured to me that if you fitted it with a CG unit, you
could *fly* the damn thing into orbit (have to use the batteries
though as the reactor won\'t run without lots of seawater for cooling). 
Have it rendezvous with one of those cargo carriers with the "net" jump
grid. and away you go.

Hmmm. Now *there\'s* an adventure idea. The players have been hired to
assist in daring venture. A late TL-4, easly TL-5 goverment has
purchased a bunch of "mothballed" TL-6 (wet) Navy units from a TL-7
world. It\'s been decided that the easiest way to transfer them is to
fit "bolt on" some drive and power units form scrapped starships and
fly the ships up to hook onto an old battle-rider tender(is that the
right term) which will ferry them to the destination (only one jump
away or nobody would be crazy enough to try this).

So you get to deal with things like sealing some compartments (and the
bridge) for use during the "flight", and finding places to attach the
CG and fusion power packs where they\'ll stay put but also be easy to
remove at the destination.

Sure, it\'s not a *normal* thing to do. But I can see it looking just
possible enough for someone to try it. 

And many a pilot would be interested just to be able to have entries in
his flight log saying that he flew a wet navy *battleship* from surface
to an orbital rendezvous, and a week later landed the damn thing!

Hell, I can even see some planets that are newly contacted deciding
(correctly, IMNSHO) that orbiting some old battle ships might make a
good start on a space station. The main guns *will* work in space at
"short" ranges (ie a few thousand km). They\'d be enough to keep
merchant ships in line.

No, you forget that pressure works out to energy per *volume*. So you
get closer to r^3 than r^2. Check out tables of blast effects for
nukes or other large explosions. First approximation is inverse cube.

In fact the standard crater diameter formula uses 1/r^3.4!

It\'s pretty much confirmed. They found the crater a few years back.
It\'s in Central America, on that "bump" that sticks out into the Gulf
of Mexico. It was a coastal strike, and the crater\'s "only" about 200
km across. If it wasn\'t for all the oil drilling in the Gulf they\'d
have taken a lot longer to spot it, as it was pretty well filled in by
sediment.

On the other hand, *none* of the above are in the habit of shafting

The Dorsai are from Gordon R. Dickson\'s "Childe" cycle. But for us
"military" buffs, I\'d suggest starting with just "The Tactics of
Mistake", "Soldier, Ask Not", "Dorsai!" (also printed as "The Genetic
General"), and some of the short stories in books like "Spirit of the
Dorsai" and "Lost Dorsai".

Falkenberg\'s Legion is from a number of books in Jerry Pournelle\'s
"Co-Dominium" series. Falkenberg starts out in ther CoDominium Marines,
and later due to cutbacks, he\'s pensioned off and basicly rebuilds his
regiment as a mercenary unit. 

The books that come to mind (far too much of my library is in storage)
are "Mercenary" and ...  (damn, I can\'t recall any other titles!)

That may not matter, depending on the nature of relationship between
the subsidiaries. Even a wholly-owned subsidiary, in the absence of
orders from above, has authority over it\'s property above that of
another wholly-owned subsidiary. Tukera may own Akshel Lines
and Aramanx Starport Management, Inc., but that doesn\'t mean Akshel
starships get free use of Aramanx berths - unless Tukera ordered that it
be so, in which case there would be contracts involved just like any
other association between two seperate business entities.

Taco Bell and Doritos may both be owned by Pepsico, but that doesn\'t
mean the manager of the local Doritos plant can send his workers over
to Taco Bell for a free lunch every day.

Btw, in the case of the more schizophrenic Megacorps, it may matter
even less. Some megacorps may decide that allowing their subsidiaries
to compete as if they were independent business units may be a good
idea - competition as a business improvement strategy. The winning
subsidiaries would be used as models for other subsidiaries, the
losing subsidiaries would be gutted and discarded. And all would
be assets of the Megacorp, ready to be taken over and directed if
some major project is intended (a corporate war, subsector settlement
plan, etc.).

directly by the Imperial Government.  For example, in America a bank
robber or interstate kidnapper can be tried directly in Federal court
without any state getting involved, even though the crime was committed
on one or more states\' soil.  Most of these laws were enacted to deal
with crimes where the perpetrators typically get away by crossing state
lines.  (Although a few may have had no other purpose than to get a
particular politician elected.)
	It would make sense for the Imperium to punish certain crimes in a
similar manner.  The most obvious would be interstellar piracy, followed
by assaults on Imperial personnel or property.  Beyond that, it\'s really
up to the GM.  Is your Imperium a lassaiz-faire state that doesn\'t
really care whether planetary governments achieve justice?  Does
virtually any felon who crosses over into another jurisdiction open
himself up to punishment in an Imperial prison?

There\'s a combined edition of the first 2 books out here called Falkenberg\'s
Legion, also interesting, while being somewhat divergent, are Prince of
Sparta, Go Tell the Spartans and... D**N now I\'ve gone into brain lock. At
any rate these books describe the actions of a detached unit of Legioneers
on Sparta. The final book also described the beginning of the First Empire
of Man (in Jerry Pournelle\'s universe). Pournelle\'s works are a good read
for Traveller, they have a lot in common, primarilly slugthrowers for ground
pounders, Jumpdrive (with fixed J-points) etc.

I\'d like to add one possible name to the list o ground pounders... Raj
Whitehall fro S. M. Stirling and David Drakes "The General" series. At the
later stages of the series he might be an excellent choice for overall
command of theground units, even if he operated on a low tech world. Of
course the fact that he is being helped by the computer Sector Command and
Control Unit AZ12-b14-c000 Mk. XIV would allow him to understand an
integrate the "modern" units into his strategy.

Common law is *always* written down as case law - that is, the decisions
of judges.  (For example, the concept of judicial review is common law,
written down in the judicial decision _Marbury v. Madison_.)  Before you
rely on this, talk to an intellectual property lawyer for your
particular country and see if he can give you a citation to a case that
states this specifically.

Marketing effects would drive the Economy/Middle/High passage distinction
higher, I suspect, in the same fashion that business and first class 
airfare is *much* higher than economy; first class gets perhaps one more
attnedent
of dedicated service (negligible cost) and occupies seats that take ~2
seats room but cost much more than twice what economy does.
The price delta isn\'t set by the cost delta but by the value delta, as it 
were. (And by the fact that most people aren\'t paying their own money to
fly business class, of course.)

This is (almost certainly) technically a brown dwarf rather than a gas giant.
(There is a meaningful distinction; brown dwarfs form like stars, as 
independent condensations out of the original dense nebular cloud, while 
gas giant planets form from accretion in a disk surrounding an already-formed
protostar.) Observationally, this means planets should tend to be in circular
(and relatively wide) orbits (unless the planet is then shuffled in to a 
close orbit, as is thought to have happened with all the newly-discovered
close gas giants) while brown dwarfs can be in the same sort of arbitrary
orbits that binary stars are.

From a Traveller standpoint, the gas giants in the PGB column should all be
real gas giants - 0.1 - 3 jupiter masses or so; 50-jupiter-mass brown dwarfs
should be generated on the table that generates binary stellar companions.

Could someone offer an explanation of exactly what each of these passage
types means in terms of actual accomodations? I mean, Low Passage offers a
chance of death in cryo - do steerage passengers (presumably awake, though
cramped), have a casualty rate as well?

And it wouldn\'t make a difference on the outcome!

IRL - there is a major oil company that a friend of mine did some consulting
work for.  It consists of 5 major business units, and the infighting is
fierce.  Part of what he (and the team he was a member of) were trying to do
was migrate them to a new e-mail system.  Most of the problems that they had
to overcome came from the fact that each business unit had it\'s own IT
department, and none were willing to subordinate themselves to any of the
others.  Each department had to literally be ordered to make the concessions
necessary from way, way up on high, and each decision was fought (from what
I heard) all the way up to the VP level (probably exaggerated, I\'m sure not
*every* decision was contested that high...)

The main problem is that the business units were, in essence, competitors
within the corporate framework.  And since they are not competing in the
open market, but behind the corporate front, only corporate policy
constrains their actions.

OBTrav - just how nasty would a internal megacorporate conflict get?

As several others have pointed out it greatly depends upon what rights you
sold to the company. And, in the case of defunct companies, how those
rights were held by the company.

There is another point which will probably benefit game supplement writers.
A company cannot buy rights to your ideas, only to the article in which you
express those ideas. So, if you developed an alien race for Traveller, the
Shoaojin, and sold an article on the Shoaojin to a publisher whom you have
a falling out with, you can write a new article on the Shoaojin, keeping
your creative work and research and sell it to whomever you wish. The mean
publisher owns your first article, you own the Shoaojin.

If the original, mean publisher hires someone to write an article on the
Shoaojin without your permission, you can sue them for poaching your idea.
If you can produce your development notes for the Shoaojin, and if the
publisher fails to prove that the Shoaojin exist in reality and therefore
are free for anyone to write about, you will have a good case.

	This is correct if you are talking about a simple copyright to a
written story.  However, there are other tools and scenarios that make
this more complex.  For example, if you sold the mean publisher the
right to trademark the word "Shoaojin," you will have to rename your
aliens before you publish a story anywhere else.  You can also sign over
rights to unwritten works, sign non-competition agreements, and a host
of other things.  Under American law, at least, just about anything goes
if the contract says so.

Part of the problem with this is that there is a massive history of
substantial long-distance trade over large distances, especially in luxury
goods, but sometimes in staples such as grain.

I\'m not going to go into detail unless people really want me to, but the
mere fact that goods people wanted were from halfway around the world (in
fact, from well beyond the \'known world\' for the consumers) and would take
6 months to get to market never stopped them being shipped, if the profit
was high enough.

I\'d even throw up the counter-theory, that consumers are often want goods
from far away, just because they are from far away.

I think the solution is using the Culture score of a world in PE ... high
culture worlds demand goods from far away, while low culture worlds dont.

My take, and the way it works IMTU, if a planet wants to extradite somebody 
where there\'s no existing extradition treaties, they place it in front of the 
Imperial Extradition Court.  Outside of the Imperium, in areas where there is 
an Imperial presence but not Imperial territory outside a Naval or Scout base, 
the senior scout administrator (for a Scout base) or the JAG officer (for a 
Naval base) will conduct a hearing in order to see if there is sufficient 
evidence to prosecute the defendant.  If so, the hearing board kicks it 
\'upstairs\' to the regular Imperial Extradition Courts.  This works both ways; 
a non-Imperial world can ask for extradition from the Imperium, and the 
Imperium can ask for extradition from non-Imperium worlds.

The gotchas are as follows:  

First off, the offense must be a crime against the safety or security of the 
Imperium, against the safety or person of an Imperial citizen, or against the 
property of an Imperial citizen.  Things like blasphemy don\'t fall under any 
of these categories, so it\'s not very likely the Imperium will extradite 
anybody to stand trial for it.

Second, there can be only one extradition attempt for any extraditable event.  
This means, if the prosecution blows it, it\'s almost the same as an aquittal 
since this event may *never* be brought before the Imperium again.  Of course, 
if the PC ever goes back there, they\'re on their own.  <grin>

Third, there is a statute of limitations in some cases.  Murder, enslavement, 
treason, and such don\'t have a statute of limitations.  Things like smuggling 
might have a statute of limitation depending on what was smuggled and what the 
smuggled goods were intended for.  Example:  the character smuggles a gauss 
rifle onto a high law level planet for use in assassinating an Imperial 
official.  The attempt succeeded, so the PC is up on smuggling, weapons 
violations, terrorism, and accessory to murder.  Some of these charges have a 
limit, like the smuggling and the weapons violations.  The accessory murder 
and terrorism charges don\'t.

Fourth, the loser has to pay the court costs.  <grin>

If it was an Imperial crime that they were interested in actively persuing, they\'d go through the trouble because it is worth it.  Shutting down a slavery ring or closing down a pirate operation is worth it, even if it\'s only for example value.  Examples tend to be deterants to the people who tend to waver.

Don\'t consider this canonical; I couldn\'t resist the Star Trek
reference, and it\'s positioned so as to (a) have broken an
otherwise nice route across that arm of the Lesser Rift, and (b)
enable one of the other systems in that subsector to have been

Hey Jeff, would you mind clarifying something for me?  By point (a) above,
can I assume that nebulae can block jump routes?  I suppose this makes a
certain amount of sense, since it might be difficult to arrive at a point
within a nebula that was "100 diameters" from *all* of the nearby gaseous
matter bitz...

Not Soloman_i_, but Soloman (RD 1538).
Hans created the "Soloman Economic Sphere",
a Reaver-era polity that got into a conflict
with an Aslan company (and its related clan)
that left both spent.

I think the reason behind it was to explain
why there wasn\'t a greater Aslan involvement
in that immediate area.

Yes.

Go through the stuff that was in the APPROVED
directory. That had a lot of the historical
material Hans had worked up.

You can run a search for Soloman Economic Sphere
on any unzipped file. That should turn up
what you\'re looking for.

	The Chixtlub?? impact basin ... Purists would note that this merely

iridium-enriched sedimentary layer, and is only circumstantial
evidence of any cause for the die-offs.

Now, consider the voyage those ships had to take. Assume their
communications gear was up to intercepting routine radio traffic out to ~1pc. 

At ~0.23c (divide the 174pc distance from Earth to New Home by 2,462
years), they would not have passed within range of their first star
(Zaggisi/1523 Solomani Rim) until c. 2118 - 5 years after the start of the
First Interstellar War.  They might hear Terran voices and codes, 7pc from
home, but they would be  fighting for their lives!  No wonder they just
kept going.

They pass through a corner of the Vegan Polity between c. 2167 and 2193,
and get a taste of some really *alien* aliens for the first time there.

When word comes in 2302 that the Nth Interstellar War has ended in victory
for Terra, they have just passed Yrsai (0511 Solomani Rim).  By the time
the Rule of Man is declared (in 2317), the ships have passed out of range
again.  They pick up the news in 2352, near newly-renamed Sidon (0308
Solomani Rim).

I imagine there was quite a debate among the crews (who were by then in
their 12th shipboard generation) and the sleepers who were awake at the
time, about whether to contact the 2d Imperium and end the voyage.  In the
end, we know what the decision was.

About the same time as the collapse of the Rule of Man and the start of the
Long Night, the colony ships pass the former borders of the Ziru Sirka,
into the semi-civilized peripheral states beyond.  After 700 years of
eavesdropping on their more successful cousins, the silence between the
stars must have been at once deafening and a vindication of their
ancestors\' decision to press on.

Seventeen hundred years of the Long Night was enough to see them unmolested
and undisturbed through Daibei and Ilelish Sectors to the Great Rift.
Another debate, this time over whether to settle in the Bight on the
rimward boundary of Ilelish and Zarushagar Sectors, may have resulted in
some colonists landing on worlds with names like Havre ("Haven", 0338
Zarushagar) and Colony Four (0738 Zarushagar); other colonies may have been
lost.

Finding the Islands Clusters in the center of the Great Rift was either the
greatest stroke of luck, or the result of Really Huge Baseline
Interferometry (TM) telescopes in the Solar System (Lunar farside? Asteroid
Belt?) picking them for a destination before the ESA launched the mission.
The colonists settled the three most promising systems in 4512-18 - just
before Cleon Zhunastu declared the founding of the 3d Imperium (4521).
Their history from then to first contact (5501) centered around colonizing
and exploiting the rest of the Clusters.


I have always assumed that, since _Eldorado_ misjumped from battle damage
sustained in the Third Frontier War, her captain would want to return to
the Spinward Marches by the most direct route:  Serendip
Belt-Gloire-Zufluct-deep space-Cerebin (0207 Reft).

I like the idea enough to think it worthwhile keeping: I am cc\'ing
this message to HIWG, and hoping that they will let the nebula stay.

The only rough thing about it is that it\'s a large coincidence:
supernova\'s are a rare thing, after all.  But I can always blame the
Ancients....

[Aside...]

Also, Jeff V., the star\'s in the Beyond sector: some of them form an
obviously
artifical hexagonal pattern.  If this is for real, then the ancients somehow
got the power to move *Star Systems* around.  I hope this isn\'t canonical,
as this
means that the Final War would have left more than mere asteroid belts
as debris!

(read blurbs in Galatic 2.4)

Apparently this IS canon, or at least semi-canon, as Paranoia Press
published this sector as shown!  Yikes!

[End aside]

(Grab\'s copy of "What if the Moon Didn\'t Exist" by Neil F. Comins)

Summary: A supernova will kill all life within a 50-light-year diameter
(that\'s
15 parsec\'s).

(Closes book)

Does anyone here know what to expect, at so-and-so
lightyears from the supernova? Ie, my guesstimate...
    50-light years - kill\'s everything
    100-light years - kill\'s all higher lifeforms
    150-light years - causes extensive damage to the biosphere:
        if human setteld, 1/2 of population dies
    200-light years - causes sigificant damage to the biosphere:
        if human-settled, 1/20th of population dies
    250-light years - marginal effect\'s of the supernova.  Slight radiation
        increase.

Actually, it doesn\'t affect my development of the Empty Quarter
too much, as it is thinly settled anyways.  And it shouldn\'t affect the
Imperium as a whole too much, either (the Imperium is BIG,
and the Empty Quarter will be taking the brunt of the explosion).
Still, I\'d like to at least discuss the implications before locking in
the supernova as HIWG dogma....

*********

I have just been informed that the system in hex 2423 at the Empty Quarter
is a client state of the Imperium (in Atlas of the Imperium).
If you have copies of the Empty Quarter, pelase change your info to match
this: I will do so from my end.

Rob has been working on the following this summer -

Metator 2 - Detailed world building for all published milieux
Imperial Grand Survey 2 - Domain scale sector mapping and generation

He may also have the following ready soon -

QSDS - quick and dirty QSDS ship design a la Infini-V
Armoury - FFS2 (1) weapon design (part of his development for FFS2)

I haven\'t seen them yet as he is emailing via a PC, not his Mac laptop.

I was reading about the takeover of Avalon Hill by Hasbro on
Gamespot.com.  They cancelled all agreements with developers
for their wargames - a Hasbro manager was reported to have said
that "Anything that takes more than an hour to play can\'t be

Not a clue about what makes a game. They probably think

	Colonel Nathan Jessup was a murdering slimeball bastard trying to
hide his disgrace behind the concepts of "Duty, Honor, Country" and
soiling them in the process.

determine the route a "lost colony" would take following the Fall of the

I\'m also concidering placing a new sector beyond Rimreach, with a "rift" of
planetless stars stretching from Spinward to Trailing. This would also
expain the fact that graphical maps show the Aslan. Sol Confed, and Hiver
territories all "ending" with their Rimward boarders basically parallel
(realizing of course that this was done originally when the first maps were
drawn, probably at the edge of the paper used).

Of course this is only relavent to MTU but I\'m interested in comments.

Gee, World Cup soccer/football is watched by nearly one quarter of the
planet and it "takes more than an hour to play" one game.  I guess it shows
you what 1+ billion people know...

Found some of it, digging more of it up as I can get to it.

There was some *NIFTY* stuff in that archive.  Too bad they shut the Pocket

By "blocking" the jump route I mean, in this case, that the
planet/system that would have enabled a nice route across that
arm of the lesser rift is simply no longer there, having been
converted into part of the shell of gasses that presents the
appearance of a colorful ring.

By now, the nebular matter probably isn\'t all that much more
dense than vacuum.

isnt as much design system abuse as usual. At this point.

Helllooooooooooo .... weeeeeee\'ve been asked to build a reeeeecon gravvie
wavvie bikie wikie. An we\'re goanna build it at techie-weckie ten, so
weeeee can have it built most anywhere, cept for those really riiiiiillly
boooooring places.

Weeeee should mention that weeeeeeve been playing-waying with
gravity-wavity wave detectors rigged up to counter-battery wattery
artilllllllery, an an an contra gravity wavity puts out gravity wavity
waves so weeeee\'d use propellors, if ourselfie welfie was on the bikie
wikie. All you hafta worry about then is sound an iiiiiiiiii-arrrrrrrr an
an an the visuuuuuual spectrum itself. An an an it\'s easier to paint
something black an an an hiiiiiiide in the dark than hide gravity-wavity
wavie-wavies.

But iffff you\'re riiilllly rilllly rillly sure that the baddie-waddies wont
have gravitic-wavitic scanner-wanners, then feeeeeeeel free to use contra
gravity wavity. But Iiiiiiii wouldnt.

Okie. So the first thingy wingy we need is a hypersonic streeeeamlined
shellie-wellie. Weeeee reckon that 7 cuuubic meeters in a short rounded
cyliner-wilinger is the way to go. That is 3.35m long an an an 1.67m in the
other diiiiirections, so it\'s 20.355 squaaare meters, so one millimeter of
liiight composite-wompisite laminate plus tennnn geees of structure-wucture
will be two hunnerd kiiilos. Weeeee then add some stealthy-wealthy
coatings, which will cost one hunnerd an twenny free kilo-wilo cwedits and
make it rillly rillly really black. Or infra-pink. Or have it in
riiiiilllly pretty patterns. Preeeeetttyyyy ...

Weeeee then add two hunnerd kiiilos of contra gravity wavity, providing
tennnnnn kilonewtons of thrust, of which you can use onnnnnne point twoooo
horizontalllllly. This costs two hunnerd cwedits an an an demands seeeeeven
kiiiilowatts.

Weeeee then add a fiiifty kiiiilos of fuuuueeelll cells (2), which will
provide twenny fiiive kilo-willo watts of pooooower an an an cost one
thousand kilo-wilo cwedits an an an use point zeeero seven fiiiiive cuuubic
meters of fuelie-wulie per hour at fuuuuullll power. Weeee\'l add zero
poooint three cuuuubic meeeters of aiitch geee aitch ceeeee deee masssing
two hunnerd seventy kiiilos an an an costing threee hunnerd cwedits.

Then we put in avionics an an an fliiiight avionics so you can go
closie-wosie to the groundie woundie at one hunnnerd an forty kilomter
wometers an hour. Weeee reckon you shoudl turn this offie-woffie an an an
calculate velocities in your headie-weadie, but those MEEEEAN mothers
against gwav bike caaaaaarnage wont let us *pout*. An an an they can set
the Navie-wavie on on on us if they wanna.

Booooth sorts of avionic-wonics add up to fooorty one kiiilos an an an cost
forty seven thousand cwedits. They will neeed fiiiiiive kilo-willo watts of
pooooower when turned on.

Then we addie-waddie iiiintergral position-wisioning, so you can telll
where you aaare, but Iiiiiii reckon this isnt that usefull, coz you\'ll
aaaalways beeee fifty centimeters offf the groundie-woundie at one hunnerd
forty kilometers an hour. It costs fiiiive kilocwedits and masses one
kiiiilo an an an demands one half a kiiiilowatt.

Then we addie-waddie a ceee-peee one computer-wuter and and and it\'s fully
functional an not one of those silly fliiiight ones. It masses 4 kiiilos,
costs nine hunnerd cwedits and need threeeee point one kilowatts.

Then we addie waddie a fifty kilometer wometer vehicle passive sensor,
which takes tennnn kiiiilos an an an costs fiiiifty thousand cwedits. It
neeeds zero point one kiiiilowatts.

Then weeee add a wooorkstation, massing twooooo hunnerd kiiilos an an an
costing onhe point fiiiive kilocwedits.

This all massie-wassies nine hunnerd kiiiilos, so weeeeee\'ll figure on nine
hunnerd and fifty so the pilot wilot can take some chhhhhiiiiiiiiiizos.

At nine hunnerd an fifty kiiilos an one point twoooo kiiiilonewtons at a
thrust efficiency of fouuurr point one. Therefore effective-wecktive full
thrust is fiiive point seven eight gees, so the top speeedie weeedie is
nineteen hunnerd an fifty kilometer wometers an hour. Cost is ummmmm two
hunnerd and thirty kilocwedits, an an an there is plenty of spare thrust an
an an internal space for a particle-warticle accelerator or fusion gunnie
wunnie or somethin, if you want it to go slower.

****************************************************************************

Woooo. I started with a grav bike, and ended up with something that is
looking suspiciously like a stealthed Vincent Black Shadow crossed with a F16.

Ditzie\'s comments about gravitic sensors are well made. It is hard to hide
gravity waves, and propellors are lookign better and better for stealth
vehicles.

The design has lots and lots of surplus internal space - about 2 cubic
meters. You could fit an observer or some sort of gun. It is also running a
power surplus of about ummm five kilowatts. Damn. I forgot communicators,
and I\'m braindead. Oh yeah. Maneuver enhancement. The Vilani Export Version
would include two more redundant computers. The Vargr export version would
incorporate go-faster stripes, and remove the flight avionics for the extra
Charisma boost. The Sayat Export Version would include a drinks cabinet and
use the waste heat from the fuel cells to run a Jet Bong (tm). The Sayat
Export Model v2 would include a small jacuzzi and a Vibrating Workstation.
I\'d better stop now.

It\'s listed in Gal (and therefore the data that I got it from) as

As I wrote to the last person that asked about it, consider it
non-canonical, and treat it as an empty hex if you don\'t like it.
I added it for two reasons: (1) Couldn\'t resist the Star Trek
reference, and (2) made a convenient explanation for the
existence of an inhabited planet that was better than J6 from its
nearest neighbor.

Oh lord! You\'ve just given me a truly *evil* idea. Picture the

annex a newly recontacted planet. The one that Raj is "Governor" on.

Ask anyone who\'s read Heinlein\'s "Friday". For those that haven\'t,
sorry, I can\'t say much because while it *isn\'t* the storyline, it
*does* affect important portiions of it.

<FNORD on>
But just remember that there are folks who claim that both world wars
were actually the fallout from internal fights in the Illuminati.

Given the hassles MegaCorps cause them, I rather suspect that unless
they were *required* to intervene (say, because they were endangering
innocent bystanders) the Imperial forces would just sit back and laugh
themselves silly (while making side bets on the outcome).

And in some case the contracts back-fire on publishers. For example,
the contracts Heinlein signed with at least one publisher had a
"lifetime" clause of some sort in them. So Heilein made arrangements
with his wife, and shortly after he died (and the rights reverted to
her) she dug out the versions *without* certain editorial changes he\'d
disagreed with and submitted them to a different publisher. They were
promptly published and it\'s generally considered that Heinlein was
correct about the changes having been stupid.

They aren\'t that rare. There\'s about one supernova VISIBLE TO THE NAKED
EYE every 500-1000 years in the galaxy. Telescopicly we observe several
a *year*. 

A galaxy has a *lot* of stars.

Shadow,

You are a truely evil Ref!!! I wish I lived close enough to play in THAT
scenario!! Of course, it would be a "disposable" character, since I expect
the next scenario would involve new ones, but what a party while they
lasted!

Yes, but . . .be careful about trademark issues.  If the Shoaojin
effectively become a trademark for the publisher, you could be prevented
from publishing anything using that trademark, and thus, lose your
rights to do anything with the Shoaojin.  Trademark and copyrights are
getting into overlapping and confusing areas these days and even the
courts can\'t keep them straight in some cases.  The answers are unclear
at best.  So, be careful and read what you sign.  ;-)

No, but . . .If the Shoaojin has effectively become a trademark for you,
then maybe yes.
Otherwise, its very doubtful.  Intellectual property doesn\'t protect
ideas, except in patents.
Using the name Shoaojin may be within the doctrine of "Fair use" in the
US law.

This sounds like misappropriation, which isn\'t really a copyright
issue.  Misappropriation is a common law state law action, and isn\'t
available in some states.  Another extremely murky area.

Hmmm.  What would you estimate is the probability of a supernova
in Imperial Space over it\'s thousand-year history?  Over Vilani Space
since the First Imperium?  If there have been supernova/nova\'s
showing up, where would you stick it in time and location?  And what would
be the effects on the Imperium?

Asking annoying questions,

Well, hopefully that same manager will be willing to let the rights to
these "non-games" go cheaply.

It\'s only "obviously artifical" because of the way the maps are
printed. Those stars could be almost half a parsec from the center of
the map hex in various directions. That\'d spoil the hexagon. But the
*map* would look the same. 

And it\'s perfectly possible for such an arrangement to happen
naturally, too.

You are forgetting that the effects are subject to the inverse-square
law. So at 100 light years, the effects are 1/4 as strong as at 50.

Also, don\'t forget that while the *light* spreads at c, the effects
that are really dangerous beyond a few parsecs travel *below* the speed
of light. That\'s because they are caused by the expanding shell of gases
from the supernova. 

So here\'s your timetable. The first column is the ditsance from the
supernova in hexes(parsecs). The others are the time it\'ll take for
effects travelling at various speeds to get there. Format of the time
is year:weeks, so 3:14 means three years, 14 weeks. The weeks are round
up to the nearest week. (I\'ve included the BASIC program that generated
this so anyone who want s to can generate tables for whatever range
they like.

Don\'t count on it.  <sigh> They\'ll file everything away and sit on
it all. 

Hasbro, supposedly, wanted AH just for the computer titles it
*might* be able to get out of their games.  You\'ll notice they
followed up by buying MicroProse last week.

I\'m really bummed about this!

Let me put it this way. Those "visible" supernovas are thousands of
parsecs away. 

Another datapoint. I have the old SPI game OUTREACH, which has to hold
the record for the largest *scale* of any wargame ever published. On
the tyical *huge* SI map, it manages to get about 2/3rds of the galaxy.
Each hex is 1200 lightyears (call it 400 parsecs) across. That means
that the entire Imperium, plus all the surrounding areas that we have
mapped don\'t even fill *one* hex. 

So there\'s a *lot* of room out there, and the odds of one happening in
or near the Imperium are slim. For one thing, supernovas tend to
involve stars of types that very rare in the Imperium (and everywhere
for that matter). The only main sequence stars that are massive enough
to eventually become supernovas are the O, B and A stars. And O, B and
A stars that have left the main sequence are type M *giants*, which we
also don\'t see in the Imperium to any great extent. 

The other type of supernova requires a close binary where one star is a
white dwarf. And I mean *close*. Again, these are and most such stars
are only recurrent novas. Which just make for interesting viewing from
the next hex over.

A hundred a *WEEK*????????????????

I\'m reading here, TNE-RCES, wearable computers, FVWM, QVWM, & *%* PBEM\'s.  I\'m 
getting 150-200 msgs a DAY, and that\'s *NOT* including the spam my sister

There are two in my webified Dean Files, one at TL11 and the other being
the memorable Ultima Grav Racing Bike. I\'ve had _man_ PC\'s drool over that
one. It\'s fast, it\'s fabulous, it goes 4200kph. Sensor arrays? Well that\'s
the problem. You can cross your sensor window in 1.6 seconds at top speed.
That\'s just enough time to say "Is that a mount...".
I think someone has already offered to post them. The Dean Files will be up
on the Core website sooner rather than later. I have a phobic reaction to
"Under Construction" signs and I\'m not keen on posting the stite until it
is _all_ ready.
Cheers,
Jo

According to the dot maps in the Vargr section of
_Cogs_and_Dogs_, the Lorean Hegemony is part of the Julian
Protectorate, and when I did up those six sectors for Galactic, I
colored them accordingly.

There wasn\'t really a way to create a "J" code for them; as I
recall, there already was a Jh (Hhkar Sphere, IIRC) and a Jl
(Lumda Dower, IIRC).  I really object on general principles to
case distinctions in something like this.

Remember also that the Protectorate is a much looser federated
state than the Imperium, or indeed most of the major polities in
Charted Space.  There\'s no reason that you can\'t have internal
Julian politics with the Loreans acting as a bloc that attempts
to oppose some of the important policies of the Protectorate, and
there\'s no reason that the Loreans can\'t go their own way on
"foreign affairs".  Check out the sector notes from Amdukan
Sector in the current version of Galactic; there is _extensive_
information on the Protectorate there, all of it either take from
or consistent with canon.

to be one of the flat-out no sh*t _weirdest_ places on the planet to be
stationed. A naval base in an actively _hostile_ country with which the bases
owner has no formal diplomatic relations. 

Seen from the Cuban perspective it\'s as if the Soviets maintained a naval base
in South Carolina throughout the cold war to the present day, and there was
nothing we could do about it short of war to kick them out.

Many years of that\'s gonna warp anyone\'s perspective of what duty and honor is.

Funny you should say that...  <grin>

IMPBEMTU, the party is in Reavers\' Deep, outside of Imperial space.  They\'re 
not too fond of Dulinor there, but they\'re even *LESS* fond of the Solomanis 
coming up from Dark Nebula to stab at Dalbei through the \'back door\'.  Some 
heavy naval actions have already gone down concerning the Impies, and of 
course, more \'stuff\' is gonna happen...

    'body' => 'I\'ve been working on refining my freight and passenger tables. I\'m still not
quite finished, but since they\'ve come up I thought I\'d better post them:


Here is a brand new set of calculations based on a series of 6,000 T ship
designs done with QSDS1.5 (plus a few extrapolations of my own). The reason
why I\'m using such a big ship is to avoid considerations of the minimum size
of a power plant at TL 9 (100 T). Since there is no 6,000 T hull in the hull
list, I\'m using the 800 T disk and multiplying all figures by 7.5.

The main difference from the earlier calculations (apart from the larger
ships) is that I\'ve adjusted the cost of the ships for TL and chosen the
cheapest one for each kind of jump. This is not quite as straightforward a
question as one might suppose, because the increased efficiency of power
plants at TL 13 and again at TL 15 makes higher-tech power plants
effectively smaller and cheaper. However, as it turns out this effect can\'t
quite compensate for the higher value of the higher-tech credits. For ships
of this size and above TL 9 ships are the cheapest jump-1 ships, but be aware
that this is not the case for smaller ships, due to the minimum size of power
plants which makes smaller TL 9 ships grossly owerpowered.

THere were some errors in my eralier figures. I hope I\'ve eliminated most of
them (without introducing new ones ;-). It seems that jump-2 is slightly
cheaper than jump-3 for jong distance freight traffic. Another interesting
point to note is that due to the high life support costs, jump-6 turns out
to be the cheapest way to for passengers to travel long distances.

I\'ve worked out two sets of ticket and freight costs. One is pretty much based
on straight Traveller rules with a few insignificant exceptions (slightly
different crew salaries, Cr300/T for refined fuel). The most significant
departure is that I\'ve allowed regular ships to jump every 10 days on the
average instead of the canonical 14. I\'ve still charged the full Cr2000/jump
life support costs.

In both sets of calculations I\'ve assumed that the ships on the average are
90% full each trip.

Note: MT and T4 to the contrary notwithstanding, I do not think that it makes
no difference to the cost of a ticket whether a passenger sleeps in a full or
a half sized stateroom. IMO a Middle passenger occupies a 4T stateroom alone.
OTOH I do think that people will be willing to put up with a little inconve-
nience to save several thousand credits, so travelling two to a stateroom or
in half-sized single staterooms do make sense. So I\'ve introduced \'Economy\'
passages for that sort of Middle passage (Actually, I\'ve only done \'two to a
stateroom\' designs, but \'half-sized staterooms\' designs will be very close in
costs). I\'ve also introduced \'Steerage\' passage which is even worse
conditions: bunks and no steward service whatsoever.

The second set of costs are based on my revised life support rules based on
the assumption that the canonical figure includes an Imperial tax of Cr1000
per jump (obviously Low passage is not so taxed, but I\'ve assumed that the
canonical cost of Cr100 per occupied low berth is a tax too) and that plain
life support comes to Cr2000/month. Furthermore that life support for
passengers (who spend only 8 days aboard on the average jump) cost a bit less
than the full Cr1000/jump. The figures I\'ve used are: Steerage passengers:
Cr500 (they have to supply their own food); Economy passengers: Cr600; Middle
passengers Cr700; High passengers: Cr800; Low passengers: Cr0.

Unfortunately it isn\'t enough just to add Cr1000 to the price to get the cost
of a ticket in Imperial space, because this supposed tax is applied to the
crew as well, so the tax on the crew spots has to be added to the cost of the
passenger tickets. A jump-1 High Passage, for instance, would cost
Cr3,118+1000+168=4,286.

  I think your need to apologize is nil. The quote itself is the gruff
sentiment of many military that have experienced combat and/or seen how their
dedication to duty was ridiculed during the Vietnam period. The context from
which it came; the Col. in the movie and his actions; is what should be
vilified. Yes, he attempted to hide his misconduct behind the sanctity of the
flag and rightly should be condemned. But, if the quote is separated from the
man, there is some nobility of spirit to be discovered in the sentiment.
   
   Before I get flamed on this, I am a military brat (my Dad retired from the
military), I grew up to serve in the military myself, I married my wife who
was in the military, with both of us retiring just a few years ago. I have a
son-in-law just back from duty in Korea. I served proudly even when we were
held in low esteem and a future president  wrote letters about how he despised
and loathed us (and who, like the Col, now wants his actions overlooked so he
"can get back to the peoples work"). I think I have some small measure of
knowledge into the military environment. So, if some on the TML wish to
disagree with the quote, please specify whether it\'s the words themselves you
wish to disavow or their use in the context of the movie.
   
   Dave (who I understand is currently in the Air Force) posted a great quote
from Thomas Paine. 
"He that would make his own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from
oppression; for if he violates this duty, he establishes a precedent that will
reach to himself" 
   
   Protecting everyone\'s liberty IS necessary if you are to keep your own.
But, while not required, it would be nice if those that do the protecting
occasionally heard a "Thank You." Either way, they\'ll still understand and
follow their duty to "stand the wall."

The difference between economy passage and middle passage is equivalent to
20% of an average yearly income (after taxes and dependents are accounted
for), the difference between middle and high 14%. You may be right, but I
doubt it.

Steerage: Bunks, no steward service at all (Non-canonical).
Low: As per rules.
Economy: Two to a stateroom, 1 steward/50 passengers. (Sort of canonical)
Midddle: As per rules.
High: As per rules.

>I mean, Low Passage offers a chance of death in cryo -

Canonically they do, but they don\'t IMTU, since there is an alternative
that costs almost as little and is completely safe (Fast berth - you get
a dose of Fast drug (Cr200) and is stuffed into a bunk; at destination
you get a shot of Fast antidote (Cr900). If properly organized (Bunk
facilities at the destination starport) a passenger may even sleep off
the drug without the antidote in which case Fast Berth is actually quite
a lot cheaper than Low Berth (A lot cheaper if you allow the ship to
stack the passengers closer than 1 to a dTon)). So IMTU Low Berth is not
dangerous (given a competent supervising medic, that is).

No. No one dies from living in a bunk for 8 days. Though they may smell
like it...

There was a good scientific article (Either SciAm or APA Monitor... don\'t
recall which) on Infantile Facial Expression a few years back... it seems
that human (and other apes) have instinctual facial expressions, which are
then culturally overridden. I got in trouble in a sociology class for
citing said article, when the instructor asserted that "Humans have no

Example, graphic arts require a "10% difference in substance" to be a

"Difference in melodic line". US Copyright in music was covered in Mus
Theory IV (2nd half sophomore music writing) at UAA... and it is so
technical that it can be totally unintelligible.

Also, the US recognizes both hand copyright and registered copyright, with
different limitations and benefits. For music, a hand copyright is only
good for unpublished works, and only for 2 years, and merely requires the
notation of the circle-c, the date, the author\'s name, and the notation
"Unpublished work".

Another key issue in US Copyright is that they DO expire... not much help
in the US for another 30 years or so... registered copyrights in the us
have a MINIMUM life of 50 years, at least for published music and graphic

Assuming you have a multi-processor 1GHz system (probably not too far out
there right now, for top of the line tech with liquid cooling) per

A thought:

What if the supernova\'s effects extend into jump space, and no ship can cross 
the supernova\'s \'wavefront\' without being precipitated out of jump (as if it 
were a 100-diam limit).  This would last until the wavefront had travelled x 
parsecs from the supernova.  If no jump is possible within the volume of the 
wavefront, or if the effect of the wavefront is wide enough (a significant 
fraction of a parsec or more) but jump is possible within that spehere, a big 
chunk of space could be cut off from the rest of the FTL universe for 
centuries.

The waveshell moves at lightspeed.  Every time the distance doubles, the intensity of the bubble is square-rooted.  Ex:  The bubble has a force of 25 at 2 parsecs.  At 4 parsecs, it\'s down to a force of 5.  At 8 parsecs, it\'s down to 2.236.  

What would happen is, jumping toward the center of the supernova, you\'d run into the surface of the distorting bubble.  You drop out of jump.  The bubble passes you over.  Assuming you didn\'t burn out your jump drive, you can now jump *inside* the bubble, but can\'t jump *out*.  It\'s kinda like walking through a one-way door.

Eventually, the bubble\'s intensity dies out.  *THEN* you can leave the area of the bubble.

I never came across this language in law school, but thats neither
herenor there.  This sounds very much like case law, and is thus open to

interpretation.  I suspect that the numbers mentioned would rarely,
if ever, be definitive for a subsequent court.  Often such language is
only put into a judicial opinion as superficial support for the
conclusion
the judge makes (as the trier of fact much of the time in copyright
cases)
based on the equities, i.e., fairness, of the situation involved.

By operation of the Berne treaty, the circle "C" is NOT required at
all.(UNLESS - the work was fixed, i.e., written down, before March 1,
1989 -
so go put the (C) symbol, your name and the year of creation on all
those
old files).
There is no longer any such beast as a "hand copyright."
Registration of copyrights in not required.
Copyright endure for the life of the author (or last living if
co-authored)
+ 75 years (thus a minimum of 75 years) OR 100 years, whichever is
shorter.

However, _if_ you have to sue someone for violating your copyright,
_then_ you must register your copyright with the U.S. government.
Fortunately, you do not have to register it before the alleged
infringement,
but just sometime before the trial starts. So the normal process is,
- - you create something that earns copyright protection,
- - someone infringes that copyright,
- - you decide to sue them and file a charge,
- - you send the paperwork to register your copyright, then
- - the trial commences.

Just a little extra:
to qualify for copyright, essentially you need an original work of
authorship fixed in some tangible medium for a minimal period of time
(writing on a chalkboard that is erased moments later should qualify -
but it will be hard to prove infringement).  Thats it.  Copyright
attaches.  No (C), no registration.  You\'re done.  Of course, if you
have to go to court, you have to jump through a few more hoops as I
mentioned briefly above.

Having said all that, to make things easy on yourself, and the courts,
when you write something you think is valuable, or don\'t want anyone to
copy, do 2 things:
1) Date it.  There are so many good reasons to do this, I don\'t think I
need to explain but it _could_ be the pivotal issue in a case;
2) Go ahead and put the (C) on there.  Its not required, but it alerts
others to your intentions to reserve the copyright for yourself.
(optional: 3) Make a hard copy and file it.

Jeff, thanks for the clarification.  I think your explantion makes one
big tent for most TUs to fit into.
I hadn\'t considered the Roman model for MTU, but now I will for at least
systems off the Mains.
It certainly opens up the possibility of more complex systems of
indentured servitude, etc.

It\'s been a while since that ciourse, hasn\'t it? 

As I understand it, ever since the US became a signatory of the Berne
convention, a copyright is in effect as soon as a work is set down. No
notation of copyright is needed. In fact, unless something is marked as
being in the public domain, you are required to assume that it *is*
copyrighted. 

Registering is required before you can file suit about a violation, and
tyhere are substantial benefits to having registered *before* the
vuiolation occvured (that let\'s you collect statitory damages rather
than being limited to "actual" damages).

Again, since we adopted the Berne rules, a copyright held by a person
or persons lasts until 50 or 75 years *after* they die. Ones held bey a
corporation last for 75 years.

In the UK the title Esquire was a courtsey title given to 2nd sons. If you want it 
indicated noble birth without a title. It became applicable when the individual 
fathered his own children (I don\'t think there was any female equivlant); its 
usage is now quite obsolete.

I think the use of Esquire for non-inheriting children would be a "nice" addition 
to the background. I believe that in Medieval France lawyers had a specific term 
of address (its been over 15 years since I studied law and my memory is 
getting rusty). Doctors get the title ":Doctor" :*>.

My first FIASCO since the PBM side was pushed out - well, thats what it
felt like - was everything I expected it to be. Which is to say, it was a
wargames convention. There just isnt the crossover. With just a few
exceptions, we were ignored by the wargamers, or else theyd trundle up and
ask what sort of miniatures we used, then wander off  disapprovingly upon
learning that there was no official line of figures.
	Funny bunch.
	We were in trouble from the start. Sometime after making a promise to send
us some (unspecified) promotional materials or - better yet - bring them in
person, Andy Lilly fell silent. Ive heard nothing from him since. (You OK,
Andy?). As the day approached we had a scenario and a booked table, but
where was the BITS promotional material? On its way, we hoped. 
	It wasnt.
	We got there OK, if you call OK being trapped in a car with a Transport
Engineer, who insists upon explaining all the road signs, and of course
navigating in that manner that only blokes can manage.... but we got there,
praying to meet Andy with armfuls of posters and flyers..... 
	We exchanged a nervous look and set up the table. Just a bunch of
rulebooks and the scenario. But still folks came past and started making
THE STATEMENT: Traveller? I thought that was out of print years ago....
	Some of them looked the gear over, shrugged, and went off to storm
Stalingrad or Cold Harbor. But a few hung about, talked to us about the
game, and even played the demo scenario.
	I was playing the Cargo-Captain of a Subsidized Merchant, the others were
crew or passengers. We awoke in the crashed wreck of the ships gig, having
been hit in the midst of a passenger transfer. wed seen the ship go down
somewhere to the north, apparently under power. There was a space battle
going on overhead - we didnt know why. She gig was a total loss, and
slowly sinking through the ice - wed crashed on an ice world. The only
option seemed to be to trek overland to the wreck and salvage what we
could.
	Oh, good.
	We grabbed what we could from the sinking wreck (all the salvageables were
listed on cards. Anyone risking a grab for supplies got to stick their hand
in a paper bag and grab a card. I risked my life for.... three personal
medkits and a large spanner. Others were more lucky - we had a survival
shotgun and an SMG, plus some cold-weather kits. 
	Great.	
	The ship sank, we set out walking through the frigid landscape. The food
ran short, tempers frayed. The Captain took charge, which started friction
with a serving Imperial Navy Officer whod been returning from furlough
aboard our ship. One of the crew was attacked by what we dubbed the
Ferocious Dog-Headed Brainsucking Monster (probably an unfair name, but
descriptive). The SMG froze up, so we tried to beat the FDHBM up with a pry
bar and a spanner. The skipper helped out by shooting the ships security
officer by accident with the shotgun. This postponed gun-unfreezing
activities. In the midst of the chaos, the Navy man cracked a cold-light
stick and lobbed it at the monster, which fled in terror.
	Probably just as well.
	We marched on. The food ran out. We sighted some small craft searching the
planets surface, agonized about it (they were Aslan and maybe hostile)
then decided that wed die if we didnt make contact. We tried, but failed
to attract their attention. The security officer and skipper came to blows.
One of the crew got lost in a snow-hurricane. 
	Three avalanches, an unsuccessful attempt to bushwhack a snow-sheep or
similar beast and another internal dispute which led to an attempt to shoot
one another, we reached the wreck. Weak, starving, paranoid and ready to
kill and eat one another, we reached the downed merchant. She looked
flyable.
	And that was where our problems really started.....

	FIASCO was actually quite good fun, despite the rather lukewarm reception
non-wargamers get. It was a shame not to have more role-players present,
but were doing FIASCO II in November. Maybe things will improve....

  One possibility is that there are likely cases of hostile member worlds
(governments or cultures, with the latter being much nore trouble) where
simply using military forces to enact a quick solution is not desirable. The
thought that particularly amused me was that while different regimes may
decide that paying the Imperial defence bills (~1% of GDP) was a Bad Thing,
there\'s really only one type of world with any chance of making it stick.

  A high-tech, high-pop world can only do so much, and the major wars of the
background indicate the Imperiums\' willingness to force a conclusion against
whole sectors or major empires. However, what short-term course of action
will be effective against a culture (as opposed to a government, popularly
supported or not) that has rejected violence and declines to fund it on that
basis?

  Possible solutions: seize off-world assets to meet current unmet funding
obligations - good as long as they have them. Blockading the world to impose
import/export tariffs to meet the bill might be workable if the vessels used
aren\'t _needed_ elsewhere (following the model that in peacetime the IN may
have trouble finding places to stack all their spare cruisers :> ), although
offworld merchants and customers will suffer as well; it might also render
the condition effectively permanent once any dislocations have been undergone.

  Landing troops seems a dubious proposition, and would cause problems for
Imperial services using planetary inhabitants elsewhere in the sector. It
might be a boring mission, and wouldn\'t accomplish much except provide
propaganda for other anti-Imperial movements. I wonder whether an Imperial
sector noble would have the authority (or imagination) to allow their payments
to be designated for non-military purposes? Admittedly, if a major (peak 3I
tech) world tried that then occupation might be the best course in the event.

I just got back from Maui.  It\'s very nice there.

I\'ve skimmed over thoughts from Ian and others, and I think y\'all
are right -- I need to figure out what long-haul trade exists IMTU.


A comment first.  The interstellar traffic rules Jon Buller and I made up 
aren\'t from the Traveller rules at all... they make use of the UWPs, but 
the method and tables are completely new.  They do work with the Traveller
tramp freighter rules, but they aren\'t the same beastie.  What we did was 
look at several generic world pairs and think what the likely trade would 
be between them, then from there derive the tables and index caculations.


Alright then, on to Rob\'s Long-Haul Trade, version 1.0.  If you haven\'t
already looked at it, please see the article Jon and I wrote on 
Interstellar Trade in Traveller: it has the tables for determining
"local" trade between any two worlds.  It\'s at

	www.metronet.com/~washi/Tas/Calida_Orbital/RobNJonStarport.html

I\'m recycling the article\'s tables to determine long-haul trade also.  
Here\'s how:

Every sector and subsector has prominent ("Important") worlds which
trade over long distances to rich and/or industrial worlds.  This effect 
is large enough to influence Imperial economics: after all, megacorps
thrive on long-haul service.

The simple sum given below assumes that the average Imperial sector
has some "Important" worlds which drive long-haul trade.  The values
represent the effects of supply and demand of such worlds on a given
world\'s market.

For any given world, calculate its long-haul trade value thus:

Long-Haul Trade Index =
	+1 if a Rich world
	+1 if an Industrial world
	+1 if a subsector or sector capital
	+2 if its subsector has no non-Imperial borders
	 (+1 if its subsector has only 1 non-Imperial border)
	+1 if its sector has no non-Imperial borders
	+1 if the world is "Important"

The Long-Haul Trade Index is a number from 0 to 7.  Use this index
and the world\'s regular Trade Index as indices into the trade table
to determine long-haul traffic through this world.  Assume traffic is
between it and Important worlds.

What is Long-Haul transport?

Long-haul transport is the moving of freight between
two distant worlds on a regular route.  Perhaps 5 to 8 parsecs
qualify as the minimum distance to call a route "long-haul", but I
think it is usually thought of as tens of parsecs -- sector-wide
and trans-sector transport.  Perhaps "more than 3 jumps" could also
be considered "long-haul".

Long-haul freight is usually quite valuable, so that the costs due
to distance and time lost in transport are more than compensated
for.  For example, precious stones or electronic equipment might
net a profit of MCr1 per ton, which would justify a 20-parsec run.

Also, long-haul freight is likely to be carried by large freighters,
for economics of scale in production as well as transport.  So,
I would probably assume a long-haul ship displaces at least 10,000 
tons, and carries a nice living area for the crew, a heck of
a lot of cargo space, and little or no passenger space.

Please note that 1000 tons of cargo worth MCr1 per ton is a tasty
treat for pirates.  It also may or may not have an armed escort...
or even fighters.

What\'s an Important world?

I don\'t know!  An important world should have a Trade Index of at
least 10, I suppose.  Worlds with a index=10 would look like this:

(Examples)
Starport A, Population 6, TL 15, Naval Base + Xboat + Gas Giant
Starport A, Population A, TL 8,  Naval Base + XBoat + Gas Giant
Starport A, Population 9, TL 13, Gas Giant

Starport B, Population 7, TL 15, Naval Base, XBoat, Gas Giant
Starport B, Population A, TL 15
Starport B, Population 9, TL 14, Xboat + Gas Giant

Starport C, Population A, TL 15, Gas Giant
Starport C, Population A, TL 14, XBoat + Gas Giant

In general cases, important worlds have a high tech level and a
good starport, though there are always exceptions.

A last word: this formula will only determine long-haul trade for
a given world.  It is necessarily general and does not show what
goods are coming from what worlds.  If such detail is needed then
it is better to be determined by the referee... this system is
for guesstimates anyway.

in the Imperium sort of look like.  Using the random world
generation system, I came up with a list of "important"
worlds from a sample size of 10,000.

"Importance" is rated based on population, starport, tech
level, and the presence of a naval base and gas giants, etc, 
and generally range from 0 to 15.  I pulled out all samples
with "Importance" values from 9 up.  The highest score was D
(that is, a 13).  (The values I use to calculate Importance
are the same as the Traffic Index... see Jon and my article
at metronet.com/~washi/Tas/Calida_Orbital/RobNJonStarport.html).

I went ahead and caulculated a stripped-down Long-Haul trade 
index for each one too, and added it at the end of each world...
the more *\'s, the more long-haul trade it does.

I\'m starting to get the feeling that this long-haul vs. short-haul
issue may alter our article once again... hmmm.

Here they are.  Looks like 250+ systems per 10,000 are "Important",
25 per 1000, or 1 per 40... roughly 1 per subsector.  And it looks
like even a TL10 world can be "Important".

By the way, it looks like the "Law Level" value isn\'t working...

Actually, you could stick them into seats like a shuttle.  I think that\'s three
kL per person.  IIRC one "Fast" week is less than a day apparent, thus it would
be closer to a TransAtlantic flight in analogy.

The big deal with Low Births is that your trip may be more than one jump away.
You just stay frozen the entire time.  So an extreme example may be booking low
passage to the far side of the Imperium.  Might take years real time, but its
like waking up the next day.

You could always pop over to the Colchester Wargames stand and try
"Mammoth Hunting" (not Traveller, I\'m afraid).

Then again, I didn\'t go and say "Hi" to the BITS stand at Harlow
Games Fest, which was a bit remiss of me. :-(

I thought the big deal with low births was the low Social Standing you
ended up with... <g>

I altered the odds for "Ice Rot" in my campaign so that a passenger in
a TL-12+ low berth, of average endurance, with a Medic-2 in attendance
will never wake up dead from a low berth. Every one of these factors
not up to snuff will creep the chances of a snake-eyes roll killing the
character upwards a nudge - an endurance-5 passenger in a TL 9
low berth with no medic will snuff it on a 5-, more if the berth has
been damaged. I\'ve considered the more elaborate rules from later
versions of Traveller (dice of damage for low survival rolls), but haven\'t
run a Traveller campaign lately to try it out in. 

Hmmm...It just struck me that I never *told* the players that I had
softened the original low berth survival rules a bit. Maybe that explains
why the players in my original CT campaign took so many risks to
avoid using the things... <g>

actually, is cannon. TNE has steerage. Rates similar to low passage.

Fast berthing should be doable in half-bunks (MT\'s Hard Times, and, IIRC,
TNE\'s FF&S1). I don\'t allow it as a standard IMTU, but I agree it should be
available. Counts as 1/30th of a person for life support sounds about right
for the FF&S2 long term life support rules.

Quite likely... my info was from 1992... GPO had several (1990, IIRC)
handouts on copyright rules per subject matter. At the time, there were 3
different ones just for music: Recorded, Written (scores), and Lyrics
without music. As I was a music major at the time, I didn\'t read much of
the rest. I read the graphic arts one due to doing some graphics work at
the time.

Unfortunately, since the rules DO keep changing (due to case law,
especially), copyright is VERY tricky. Interesting that they dropped the
"Hand Copyright".

Ob Trav Copyright, Trademark, and Patents:
I seem to recall a CT reference that states that patents are not imperially
registered, held, nor enforced...

I have assumed that this also extended to Copyright, but NOT to trademarks
IMTU. I assume all imperial charters include a limited number of trademarks
(I assumed 2 per LIC issued) hence the stable sysmbols of imperial
corporations.

Sounds something like the company I work for. It is a subsidiary of
two large companies formed to allow them to work together in a certain
field and now the two parents are bidding against us in our contract.

I have hardcopy of a message dated 25 Jan 1994
from Joe Heck, Subject: FOR ARCHIVES (Core.Data)

which has full 1115 UPPs for RD, along with
other stuff. Have you found this file?
It has a lot of other background info as well.

The homeworld of the Poramat (one of which featured
in "The Survivor" scenario)was going to be 0310.
I forget the name of the world I was going to use.
It has an alignment code "Ta", so the Keith Bros.
had something for it, but since we couldn\'t dig it
up (it had never been published) I was just going 
to overwrite with my own stuff.

That world (and the one it controls) are on a
22-world main that extends into neighboring
Aslan space, and it\'s seperated from human-
dominated areas by a J3 gap, so it\'s major
ties were to the nearby Aslan clans rather
than to the Deep proper.

	Even worse than that ... we could probably have kicked the Soviets out of
South Carolina ... there\'s no way the Cubans could kick us out unless we
let ourselves get kicked out.

	And once a year we send them a check for about a thousand dollars, which
is the lease fee. And the lease was forever ...  I understand Castro
refuses to actually cash the checks, as a protest.

Possibly even worse, as you\'re basically right up against the real "enemy"
and not a two-bit puppet like Cuba.

Actually, they "could" kick us out.  They could overrun the base before 
we could respond militarily (with conventional weapons).  Training 
evolutions have proven this time and time again.  However, if they did 
this, they would face the full-scale US response, which would be to take 
over Cuba.  

And as Dave said, the lease is forever.  We must mutually agree not to 
continue the lease for it to lapse.

I am not a fan of GURPS - I had not planned on incorporating it into my
campaign.

But I like the TNS write ups (but Lauren, you may want to have someone check
the continuity - the dates jump around pretty badly), and they are going to
continue the setting that I prefer to run my campaigns in.

(gritting teeth) - maybe it\'s time to revisit that decision...  (but I\'m not
changing my IMTU yet!)

Really?  I figured he was being "cured" of what ails him...or at
least what ailed his brother.  Of course, the *original* Admiral
Ilethian may not exist once he\'s cured. ;->

Loren, as someone mentioned in another post, the TNS entries are
getting jumbled as each new set of entries is added to the beginning
of the file (it sort of looks like that).  Someone needs to sit down
and spend ten minutes cutting and pasting the document source of
news.htlm to get the entries back into chronological order.

We observe several supernovae a year, but all are in external galaxies.
The typical supernova rate is thought to be about one per fifty years
per milky-way-sized galaxy. As Leonard says, only one per five hundred years
are so has been visible to the naked eye, largely because the plane of our
galaxy contains enough dust to render the rest invisible. We\'ve only had
the technology to detect "invisible" supernovae (through infrared or neutrino
emissions) for about twelve years. (There was a supernovae in the magellenic
clouds, a mere 150,000 light years away, that was (barely) naked-eye visible
eleven years ago.)

One per fifty years per galaxy => 1x10^-13 / star / year. Charted space is 
maybe 400 parsecs on a side in Traveller, containing perhaps 80,000 stars,
so we would expect about 1 supernova per 100,000,000 years within its
boundaries.

If we pretend our galaxy is two dimensional, though, we then get 1 supernovae
per 1x10^10 square parsecs per year, or one every 62,000 years in the 
Imperium. 

Still a low enough rate that I woudl say no "official" supernovae should be
enshrined in Traveller canon.  (If nothing else, it would be a tremendous
coincidence to have *two* such events within the Imperium, and every referee
should have the option of blowing up one of their own stars.)

Supernova "kill radius" is a highly debated number - between 10 and 100 
light years is the typical value for wiping out an ecosystem and/or causing
a dinsosaur-killing mass-extinction.

Well, that takes care of another ringleader of the plot.  (Hutara 
brought his fleet over to Dulinor on almost the same day in the MT
timeline).  Note his watchdog "new aide", Lieutenant hault-Musillo.
We know where Isis ended up, so there aren\'t too many loose ends 
left undone; except, of course, where the point of divergence is 
and how the Imperium found out.

Perhaps Daddy Dulinor sent Isis to her room once too often and she tipped
INI.  ;-)

The G:T TNS batches are in reverse order.  The first one is at the bottom,
latest at the top.  If people are saving these, they\'re seperated a horizontal
rule.  It should be easy enough for interested parties to chop em up

This is the order that the TNS dispatches are on the page:
152-1116
212-1116
215-1116
230-1116

137-1116
140-1116
145-1116

131-1116
132-1116
137-1116

Now, you are right.  I can easily figure this out (and did) and set the
timeline straight.  I\'ve also been playing Traveller since 1977.  I\'m also
very familiar with the storyline and the layout of TNS messages.  I strongly
recommend that the TNS be laid out in either forward or reverse order
(reverse would probably be best), and that they be consistant.

For someone who is not familiar with the TNS layout, who is reading this as
new, it could be very distracting.

Might be more to that than you think.  Isis was reported to be a
close friend of the Grand Princess.  It\'s very possible her
friendship to Impegina (sp) and loyalty to the Imperium outweighed
her loyalty to her father.  She did get elevated to Arch Duchess
*awfully* quickly after Daddy Dulinor went boom...*if* he went boom.

Does Prince Varian\'s sudden departure for the Spinward Marches have
anything to do with all this?  Is he hunting for something...or
someone out there?

Hi Kenji, welcome back! Just where "back east" here are you going to school?

You could always just use the GURPS Traveller source books.
Behind the Claw (which covers the Spinward Marches) is in
playtest now ans should mesh smoothly with all your old
material.

That\'s true - they shouldn\'t be any harder to translate to my hodgepodge
than some of the other adventures I\'ve snagged.

Many thanks!  I will be using your system to help determine
the more important systems in The Empty Quarter, when I can squeeze
out the time....

Also, a tip of the hat to Leonard Erickson: even though I decided to
scotch the supernova in EQ, the info is still very useful for all Traveller
ref\'s - including those who decided to keep B. Niobe exploding.


Space is so large, and the Imperium so tiny....

When I read that quote, I was thinking of the many risk\'s that soldiers
take to protect the lives of their fellow citizens, and applying civilian
standards to a military situation is rather unwise and can be implicitly,
loathsomely santimonius (as well as fatal). The use of this truth by
Col. Jessup to justify violating the constitution that he swore to protect
was
not in my mind at the time (although, on reflection, that was obviously
what Col.Jessup was trying to do).

Heh.  Personally, I expect the Imperium to be more subtle then that,
especially with TL G technology available to them.

In the meantime, I wonder whatever happened to the Illeish Guard?

Lorean, I know you are probably drowning in work right now, but after
the tidal wave,  do you plan to update TNS on a regular basis, say
bi-weekly?
Will you skip 1117-1119, and go straight to 1120?   Or will it be a "special
event" notice board?

If you like where you are (say,TNE) stay there, and just buy the
GURPS book\'s as background material.  Actually, most GURPS books
*are* background material, if I remember correctly.
You will be in a position to work in a living, changing
Imperium with whatever rules you please.

Especially as one of the Stated Goals of GURPS:Traveller is to republish
lot\'s of classic Traveller material in an updated form - which remind\'s me,
when *should* we expect the Alien books?

In Milleu 0, Sylea at TL C was already rewriting personalities, with
unfortunate self-destructive side-effects.  I\'m sure that the 1110\'s
Imperium, with access to TL G, has it down to a few small tweaks -
the dear Admiral won\'t feel a thing.

Whether his niece will approve is, of course, an entirely different
matter....

Can you give us some numbers (in Traveller terms) for a system that has
novas? Things like size of the non-white dwarf companion, and the
corresponding orbital distance?

Also, what are the effects of a Nova like insystem? And how bright does
it get outsystem?

I\'d think that there ought to be a few novas in the explored area.

For that matter, how common are Cepheid variables (and other variable
star types). They\'d make for interesting systems, assuming planets are
possible.

I\'ve been thinking of suggesting that a table similar to mine would be
a good use of a page somewhere in the next edition of the rules. It\'d
give refs a quick reference for everything from the effects of
supernovas, to how long it\'ll take that misjumped ship to reach the
nearest star system. Or how long it\'ll take for their (radioed) call
for help to get there) :-)

And if we stick in some "local color" items such as nova stars, then
you can use it to figure out when they\'d be seen in various systems.
Makes a nice bit to drop into things when the local news tells folks to
keep an eye on the sky because the XXX nova should be visible soon.

1. The correspondence generated by "Mark Seemann" \'s initial query was
interesting.
In the TNE rules, energy weapons are described as having a \'pilot laser\'
which ionises
the air to form a conduit for the plasma bolt.
Why couldn\'t a similar device (appropriate wavelength laser or sonics)
be used underwater,
avoiding the messy steam explosion problem ?
The same trick could be used to fire missiles through the water at
transonic (?) velocities
- - a la the old \'Subwars\' game by MicroProse.
Other possibilities include taser type weapons fired like conventional
spear guns (elastic/compressed gas) ; sonic or electrical grenades
(though conventional HE would be
much cheaper) ; and rocketry or torpedoes (natch).

2. Using fast drug to act as a no-frills \'passage adjuvant\' would be
interesting, to say the least. The ship\'s medic would have to turn the
passengers several times a day to prevent the formation of pressure
sores. (Inferring from my experience of patients with spinal cord
lesions).
I wonder if fast drug also acts as a muscle relaxant - are your muscles
proportionately less flexible? If it does so, you will need to be placed
on artificial ventilation regardless of
your metabolic rate.
Imagine having a blurry human form glide up to you and try moving your
arm or leg into position - ten or thirty times, or more, faster than
your nervous system (maintaining posture through proprioception) will
permit - SNAP!
I think I\'d take low passage - it\'s more invasive, and you\'re unconcious
- - but, \'paradoxically\' it\'s safer as a result, as attending personnel
get advance warnings of disaster. If they pay
attention.....
Drugs are not without risk - ?anaphylaxis, unpredictable reactions eg.
total skin dequamation
with penicillin and sulphonamides...., interactions with other drugs...

3. Fuel purification plants - enigmatic little black boxes, aren\'t they?

Each cubic metre of gizmo burns from 5 to 10 kW per six hours per cubic
metre of \'fuel
processed\' , according to FF&S 4.1.
I would have thought one of the most efficient ways of sorting gas giant
scrapings or water, or whatever, would be to plasma torch it and use
mass spectrometry (different ionised species move differently in
electric and/or magnetic field).
It\'s difficult to reconcile the listed power consumption with the
advertised performance ;
you would need lots of power to heat up your inlet mixture and cool down
the stuff that comes out the other side...
An alternative would be to use high performance gas (or liquid)
chromatography. Less power is needed to run the compressors.
What do you do with your \'waste\' gasses - or do you crack ammonia and
methane down to nitrogen and carbon dioxide respectively via a plasma
torch first, and vent what you can\'t use (although ammonia and methane
might be useful for the ship\'s extended life support system..) ?
It\'s difficult to get deuterium this way (1 per 14000 hydrogen atoms or
less).....

4. A question for the gearheads :-
Why are some Traveller power plants either grossly inefficient eg.
fusion and fission or
thermodynamically ridiculous eg. low tech steam ?

i. Fusion - as published, efficiency is substantially less than one
percent.
Assuming 0.5% mass conversion per fusion, one litre of liquid hydrogen
is required to generate a megawatt-year (albeit at 100% efficiency).
High-temperature superconductors should be around by TL9 or 10 ; 10%
efficiency should be easy to achieve (doesn\'t zero electrical resistance
imply almost perfect heat transmission, within the limit of the Second
Law of Thermodynamics?)
The \'evil that is Fusion Plus\' is even worse. My guess is that it is an
intrinsically less efficient proposition because :-
     a. Heavy water requires electrolysis ;
     b. You need some energetically expensive processes to generate
muonic atoms.
(I suppose that electrons in the hydrogen are replaced with muons to
make the atoms smaller, and hence easier to approximate and fuse in this
contraption!)
The copious amounts of steam given off make this kind of power plant
\'non-stealthy\'.

ii. Fission - IG don\'t proofread too well. Either that or someone has a
distinct anti-nuke bias.
Fission plants burn way too much fuel.
Breeder reactor technology was described at TL 5. We\'re only just
starting to explore the more advanced designs now, in the Real
World(tm).
For a 1 MW equivalent plant, you\'re looking at about 250kg fuel per year
(enriched uranium
oxide, carbide or nitride with about 3% U235).
If you recycle the fuel (U-Pu recycling), you end up requiring 2 to 5 kg
per year to top up!
Radioactives should have a density of about 10 tonnes per cubic metre to
reflect that you\'re
using salts instead of elemental metal.
The nuclear thermal rockets listed from the adapted George Herbert table
are broken.
Fuel consumption should read :-
NTR - 7         5.94
NTR - 8         5.90
AdvNTR - 8   4.17
GCNTR - 9    2.5

iii. Antimatter - some of the pods are more than 100% efficient.
For a 1 to 1 mixture of  liquid hydrogen and antihydrogen, five litres
will produce 1000MW
per year at 100% efficiency....

Sorry for being a grizzleguts.

The facts:

On 131-1116 Archduke Dulinor\'s gig blows up killing Dulinor. Then the senior 
officers in the Ilelish Guard resign and the Ilelish Guard is pulled off duty 
protecting the Emperor. Dulinor\'s daughter Isis is appointed to succead him as 
Archduke and his brother resigns as Sector Admiral. Meanwhile Prince Varian 
leaves Capital and disappears.

The engimas:

Was Dulinor planning to assassinate Strephon? if so why not just arrest him for 
treason, was the Empire worried about the scandel, did they lack evidence to 
be sure, was it Strephon\'s "gift" to a friend (an honourable death)? Why was his 
daughter appointed to succead him? Surely the Empire would not put the 
daughter of a traitor in such a position. Why have the other "conspirators" been 
allowed to live? If you can alter their personalities why not alter Dulinor\'s? Why 
did Prince Varian suddenly leave Capital? We know from MT that prior to 131 
both he and Prince Lucan had been planning to travel together later in the year. 
Was Lucan "in on the plot"? Was the Type TJ that arrived and snarled up traffic 
on 212 carrying the real Strephon from the Longbow project? If it was then it 
had to have left before Dulinor\'s gig exploded. When Admiral Hutara\'s 
resignation was announced in 244 it stated that he was resigning to 
concentrate on the family business now his neice had been made Archduke. 
However Isis was not appointed as Archduchess until 140, even at jump 6 the 
news could not have reached Dlan by 244; however the news of Dulinor\'s death 
would have just reached Dlan on 243. But yet there\'s the fact that the press 
statement says the Admiral had been ill for a few days. If so did the orders to 
remove Hutara leave before 131 (I haven\'t done the sums, but if the TJ on 212 
was Strephon, then I think the orders to remove Hutara could have left Capital 
at the same time as the "recall" went out to Strephon).

The "wildcard":
Duke Norris. Appointed as Archduke of Deneb and summoned to Capital for 
001-1117 (meaning jump 6 there and back) along with Lady Isis. Is this just a 
red herring or is there something deeper here?

Hmmm, its all very interesting. Loren, can we expect more hints in G:T or BTC.

When I hear the word inverse cubed I reach for my Rheinmetall.

Well, I have a book on weapon design (non gamerelated, the real thing) and
in it I\'ve found a formula for pressure being proportional to inverse
square of range. They also mention that it is pressure that does the
destruction.

The reason crater diameters are roughly prop to 1/r^3 is that explosive
energy is more or less prop to the mass of matter blown away. That is not
the acse for a travelling wave in water or air.

Or rather big airliners are more economical per seat so the few business
travellers have to subsidize the economy class passengers in order to get
cheaper fares themselves. If everybody travelled at cost in airliners there
wouldn\'t be much nonbusiness travel and the airlines would have to use
smaller planes thus increasing the business ticket prices.

Or so they say...

THE DEAN FILES
   347 MegaTraveller Ship designs by the prolific R.S.Dean ranging from a
TL4  Longboat to a TL16 SDB.
    If others have MegaTraveller ships they would also like listed, I\'m
more than happy to increase the files.
    If someone has a large archive of ships from some other Traveller
vehicle design system, I\'d also be happy to consider hosting that.

ASTROGATION
    Many years ago GDW posted sector information to the GENII BBS. This
migrated later to Sunbane. These were a great service to the Traveller
on-line community but both of these are now gone. I\'ve tried to gather
together this information again, plus as much other astrogation information
we know about the Imperium and beyond.
    The concept of "charted space" was presented in several DGP
publications. This area covered 550 sectors and, basically, comprised
dot-plot information. On the CORE site you will find 550 sector files in
GENII format. Most of these, sadly, are empty. But I\'ve tried to collect
all the information I could on the rest. So far 64 sectors have more than
place-holding information.
    If any of you have painstakingly type in sectors from dot-plots, I\'d
love to hear from you. It would be really useful to have all this sort of
information available in once place. Space is limited, though, and the
archive is restricted to top level information. I know many people out
there have developed detailed information on subsections, systems and
worlds. If you send me you links, I\'m happy to link that part of the
astrogation database into your web-site. Hell, if you just have a web-site
and would like to give it some "locality", let me know the planet of your
choice and I\'ll link it in.

THE TRAVELLER ADVENTURE
    In the spirit of the Solitaire Play option of Classic Traveller and the

That\'s weird, if you find explosive safety manuals they tend to specify that at
a distance of X*(quantity*quality of explosives)^1/3 there will be a certain
level of damage.  If you find statistics on overpressure effects of nuclear
weapons you find that the destructive radius of the shockwave is about .32 in
explosive force (destructive radius of the flash is about .41).

Either (1) they\'ll actually know what it means, or (2) they\'ll consider it to

Alas, if you check the tables in books like "The Effects of Nuclear
Weapons" you\'ll find that *all* the blast effects that depend on
"overpressure" are inverse cube.

The inverse square ones are the radiation (nuclear and thermal) effects.

And since these tables were generated from actual tests, it looks like
there\'s a problem with your reference.

Because "ionizing" water *is* converting it to steam *plus* adding even
more energy. 

It\'s an insoluble problem. Water *isn\'t* "transparent" enough to
transmit the required energy densities without absorbing major amounts
of the energy. And absorbing that kind of energy converts the water to
*at least* steam, if not actual plasma, with the resulting explosion.

Heck, "ionizing" a path thru the air is creating a low-grade "linear
explosion". It\'s just that the volume difference between air and
ionized air (plasma) is fairly small. The difference between liquid
water and steam is a lot bigger and nastier.

> The same trick could be used to fire missiles through the water at

Except that the trick doesn\'t work at all. 

Consider the fact that to open this "passage" you have to exert enough
outwards pressure to keep out the water. That\'s going to create an
overpressure wave, which will cause the *same* effects as an explosion!

Remember, a measly 30 feet down the pressure if 15 psi *above* whatever
atmospheric pressure is. A 15 psi overpresuure wave will turn
reinforced concrete to gravel!

You\'ll have a major problem with current leakage thru the water. Also,
anything capable of much range will tend to do *severe* damage at
closer ranges.

Not necessarily the most efficient. That\'s probably an "easy" method,
but it does require heating, cooling, and those magnetic fields for
sorting. 

For *cheap* you electrolyze water. For the gas giant stuff:
1. 
  Input: H2, He, CH4, H2O, NH3
  Process: filter thru pertmeable membranes
  Output: H2 to tanks
          He discarded
          CH4, H2O, NH3 to step 2
2.
  Input: CH4, H2O, NH3
  Process: cool & condense
  Output: H2O to step 3
          CH4, NH3 to step 4

3.
  Input: H2O
  Process: electrolysis
  Output: H2 to tanks
          O2 to step 4
4.
  Input: O2, CH4, NH3
  Process: oxidation (combustion *or* fuel cell)
  Output: H2O to step 3
          N2 discard
          CO2 to step 5

5. 
  Input: CO2, possibly H2 from tanks
  Process: "cracking"
  Output: C discard [1]
          O2 to step 4
          H2O to step 3

[1] depending on various factors this carbon could be soot, graphite,
or even diamond. I expect that the process would be set up to produce
graphite or diamond as soot is too much of a pain to clean out.

Alternatively, you can send the CH4 thru a step using chlorine to turn
it to CCl4 and HCl. The CCL4 is easily decomposed into carbon and CL2,
and the HCl can be thermally cracked or electrolyzed. But this requires
large amounts of chlorine on board.

See above. Ammonia converts to water and nitrogen with the helkp of a
bit of (recyclable) oxygen. Methane converts to water and carbon
dioxide the same way.

Nope. Superconductors especially ones that operate at "high" temps,
tend to be *lousy* thermal conductors.

Very true.  Also, by rifling the barrel of a shotgun, you destroy it\'s
ability to project an even pattern of shot any useful distance.

Hmmm.  IIRC, it\'s more like half and half, but the answer is still right.
A frictionless barrel *would* help.

Nope.  If this were true, most full-auto weapons will cook off in battle.
(I own several machine guns, including a belt-fed, and have run several
hundred rounds in that short a period on numerous occasions with no ill
effects.) The actual temperature (ala boxed ammo caught in a residential

Actually, while caseless ammo is more likely to ignite, it is less
likely to do any damage since, unlike modern cased ammo, the deflagration
(not detonation) is not contained by a case.  These tend to go off like
little tiny grenades when they burn (although modern firefighting turn-
out gear will typically stop the shrapnel.)

Hope this helps.

I believe it was explained in \'Arrival Vengeance\'. Since I don\'t have
that one..I can\'t rightly say. It is mentioned but not explained in
\'Survival Margin\'

It might also be in the Regency Sourcebook.

Gee golly Anders, why don\'t you ask my wife that question.  Her response
would go something like; why are you working for less than half of what you
could make on the "outside" or why don\'t you get a job that you only work 40
hours a week like a normal person; or do we really have to be separated for
two years just because I want to stay here and finish my degree....Maybe she
would throw up the fact that I seem to have left bits and pieces of myself
on three continents or possibly where was I when my daughter was 1 - 5 years
old.  If you think about it, then the answer is too obscure to just say we
went into it with our eyes open and just to receive a pay check.  Its a shit
load more than that.

Have you ever served in the ARMED FORCES? (Think about those two words for
just a minute.)  No matter what country you live in there is something to be
said for the person that decides to make a commitment like that.  A
commitment to put your life and limb on the line for the beliefs that you
have.  Right or wrong, to serve without being forced (drafted) is making a
hell of statement to the rest of the world.

Never mind, this is probably all wasted typing based on the wording of your
comment.  I\'ll save myself for something that is more deserving of a
response.

They aren\'t the dates that the message arrives at a location - for example,
Regina? So some messages would arrive out of sync?

Definitely NOT.  Unless we are only talking about shotguns firing shot (I
see the word "rifle" mentioned above), a frictionless barrel cannot impart
any spin on the projectile, meaning that your accuracy is all shot to hell
(pardon the pun).  Fin-stabilized discarding sabot rounds would be
mandatory if a frictionless barrel were used on any conventional firearm
besides a shotgun.

I believe that the date/UPP represents when and where that specific report
was generated.

The messages I am referring to are not the \'this just in...\' messages, but
rather the archive that you can review the various story threads.  I would
(and do) expect those to be in some sort of order (chronologically has
always been the standard.)

It may improve accuracy somewhat, though most modern slugs are designed in
such a way that they spin anyway, or use a sort of \'fin stabilisation\'.
Rifling won\'t cause damage when shot is fired, but the pattern will spread
far to quickly, thus making shot useless when fired from that weapon.

>2)  Would adding a truly frictionless surface to the inside of the barrel
>help or hurt such a weapon?

My guess is that no modern firearm would work proberly if their barrels
were frictionless, because the bullet would leave the barrel before a
decent pressure built up behind it. However a weapon designed for a
frictionless barrel might work OK, until something damaged the surface.

>3)  At what temperature do modern 9mm cased powder pistol rounds start
>cooking off?

A few hundred degrees Celsius IIRC, though this depends on how long they
are exposed to the heat, as it has to penetrate the shell casing.

>4)  Can non-cased rounds cook off? (I believe Germany\'s ground forces are
>using
>such a round.)

Only at very high temperatures, because they are made from a stabilised
high explosive with a very high cook-off temperature. Normal propellants
cook off far too easily in caseless designs, because a caseless weapon
heats up faster because normally the empty case takes a lot of heat with it
when it is ejected. 

BTW the German Army isn\'t using the fine G11 caseless assault rifle, as the
then West German government decided to use the funds earmarked for buying
them to bolster the reunified economy instead. This was diredctly
responsible for H&K\'s purchase by Royal Ordinance.

I would say that a far more healthy statement is made by a person choosing
not to serve in the armed forces. True, armed forces were neccessary a
while ago, but times have changed in the US and in most of Europe (unless
you live in former Yugoslavia).

I choose not to serve in any armed forces of any kind, and I am proud of
it. I do not think that risking your own life is a good way to fight for
your ideals, since there are many other, more peaceful ways of doing so.

Except that is it _not_ a secret code.  Therefore we ask that anyone who

somewhere under that. Interesting to discover that the production of the

    'body' => '(Modified from Word Watch, from _The Atlantic Monthly_, August 1998)

K & R industry, noun
the growing number of personal-security companies that offer so-called
kidnap-and-ransom insurance -- costly policies that, in the event of a
kidnapping, provide ransom money and the services of a professional
negotiator -- to high-risk clients, such as out-of-subsector CEOs and
bankers, famous people, and the super-rich....

BACKGROUND: Most K&R professionals were once Imperial covert operatives,
MoJ field agents, or Special Investigation personnel.  They are typically
pitted against professional kidnapping squads made up of ex-mercenaries,
criminal syndicates, or anti-Imperial agitators.  Given this combination, it
is hardly suprising that the lingo of K&R is a blend of military jargon,
street slang, and bureaucratees: K&R _operatives_ on assignment are on
_deployment_.
On occasion they deal with _fast-food kidnappings_ -- ones inolving
relatively
low ransoms, of perhaps Cr 30,000 to Cr 60,000, and rapid negotiations.

Although K&R _companies_ offer little in the way of preventive services
(that being a mercenary or Imperial concern), some clients, in addition to
paying annual K&R _premiums_ ranging from Cr 10,000 to upwards of  Cr
150,000, buy _vaccinations_ directly from potential kidnappers: in Ian
subsector (Corridor), for example, a
Cr 60,000 vaccination is said to protect against a Cr 500,000 kidnapping.
(For their part, kidnappers follow the _Preserve the Porcelain Rule_, the
aim being to keep the victim alive.)

*************************

There are a number of cultural factor\'s that I hope will be addressed
in the (eventual) mercenaries book.  Among them:
   - Powerful independent groups (ie "Hammer\'s Slamer\'s" style)
   - paraImperial merc\'s, which act in a pro-Imperial fashion
     without actually carrying the Imperial StarBurst before them
   - baby mercenaries, effectively ghetto-boy\'s with gauss rifles
     (still trying to make the down payment for a TL C battlesuit)
   - Corporate mercenary groups: MegaCorp, major corp, and minor corp
   - Mercenaries, national armies, colonial troops, noble Regiments,
     Imperial Guards, and Imperial Marines - who look\'s out for whom? Who
are
     natural enemies?  And who is the Best of the Best - in equipment?
     In professionalism?
  - The Imperial Laws of War - what can be done, what can\'t, and what
     are the grey area\'s?
  -  Mercenaries and Hortalez et Cie, the megacorp banker: mercenary
     bond\'s and financing
  -  StarMerc\'s, Pirate\'s, and the Imperial Navy

This isn\'t all: but other\'s are more knowledgable about strictly military
concerns...

Sorry, Jens. If you wanted the matter in private email, you should have
responded to Thom in private email. Putting your own opinions up in a
public forum and then asking that other people please not refute them
publicly is somewhat... underconfident.

I would be very interested in your examples of "more peaceful ways" to
fight for your ideals. I would be particularly interested in which ones
would be effective in the face of an advancing invasion force. I would
also be most fascinated with your theories as to why a foreign power
would choose not to attempt to take away your nation\'s resources if your
nation had no means with which to defend those resources.

If your answer is \'fear of condemnation by the world community,\' I ask
you to say why there is any reason for a nation to fear the condemnation
of others under those circumstances. \'Economic sanctions\' hold no threat
to a nation which may simply advance across the next border to seize
what it wishes to.

I ask respectfully that you try, just try, to picture a world in which
everyone in your nation made the same choice as you -- not to serve in
the armed forces -- and in which no other nation took up the mantle to
defend your nation in their absence.

How long would you remain a soverign nation? How long until another
power decided to make your territory and resorces part of their own?

I also have chosen not to volunteer for my nation\'s armed forces. But I
do respect and appreciate the sacrifice that my countrymen make when
they volunteer to give up part of their freedom in order to defend mine. 

Making political statements, writing treaties, and forging economic ties
are all vital to improving relations between the nations of the world,
and these functions are not served by the military. However, it is the
military which ensures the peace under which those activities may occur.

Likewise, and to the rest of the list:  I fully recognise the fact that
this matter is off topic, however it was simply not possible for me to
allow these comments to go unrefuted. I hope that I have spoken for many
and that we can now put this matter to rest.

Thank you for your kind indulgence,

Ben

PS: Jens, since we have both had our say now, I do hope you will choose
to reply to my message privately. I am truly interested in the reasoning
behind your views.

There is name for a shotgun with a rifled barrel, it is called a
"rifle".  If you rifle the barrel of a shotgun it isn\'t a shotgun

Actually, the steel rifling lands would distort lead shot, screwing with
it\'s aerodynamic properties (ie: small round bitz fly truer than small
chunky bitz).

Interesting.  I suppose that modern firearms due take barrel friction into
account when working out the pressure spikes upon ignition.  My guess is
that they would have to go the opposite way of TNE\'s ETC ammunition and use
a v-e-r-y quick burning propellent.

  As a few wild guesses try:
  i) Yes.
 ii) Because - personal reasons (it\'s not original, but "everything is
personal")
iii) Relatively safe, and it defused suspicions?
 iv) Without Dulinor the other conspirators may only be dangerous if they
think that all their lives are forfeit (i.e., why not revolt anyway and
have a chance at success or an eventual amnesty?). However, Dulinor could
still function as a figurehead for his followers if he lived, and his
advisers could safely assume _that he would have wanted it that way_. Besides,
with his own INI (or other relevant agency) staffers on-side then his own
de- or re-programming might have been practical *.

I\'d agree, though Mr Cook is far more knowledgable than lil ol me.  : )  Not
two weeks ago at the range, I shot off 200 rounds of 7.62 in about 30 seconds
out of an M240.  That was both preceded and followed by 800 (in groups of
200).  That totals 1000 rounds in about 15 minutes and we weren\'t cooking off.
Though during one misfire (of many, grr), i was quite... startled (to put it
mildly) to see a round sitting in the chamber when i opened the cover
assembly.

I\'m not worthy.  My own feverish attempts to degrade my own moral health this
summer have come to naught :(    Translating excerpts from _Macho Sluts_ into
Vilani hardly counts. 

Maybe I should volunteer for the Armed Forces of my nation.  After all, much
like pirates in the Third Imperium, volunteer soldiers pretty much all have
repressed homosexual tendencies; take the famous war hero Duke Norris, for
example.  

(Actually, I\'ve noticed canonical evidence that Norris only rose to prominence
through the use of recovered TL-H Rule of Man technology.  That, and half-
dice.)

Well, I will get back to this later in my letter. First, I will answer
your statements, to show you what I mean.

Yes, I do. Let me explain why.

There are two neutral European states, Sweden and Switzerland. We have
been neutral for quite a long time now. Even Hitler (a far worse enemy
than Soviet) respected the neutrality of Switzerland, a very rich but
poorly defended country on the German border. Sweden is not a rich
country, even less so when compared to Switzerland.

Also, attacking a neutral state is extremely bad publicity for any state.

> Do you believe that anything less than armed force would have removed

No, and I agree with you here. Military force was needed to stop Saddam
(who I personally believe to be plain crazy). Also, the US military action
here was handled in a respectable fashion, with as little casualties as
possible.

Still, I would have preferred removing him peacefully, but that was not
possible.

> Do you believe that Hitler could have been stopped through peaceful
> means?

No, and I have nothing to say to defend my statement in this case. The
French resistance, and the D-day troops (US, Canada, Great Britain)
sacrificed themselves in a very brave way, and managed to succeed, despite
the odds. Many people have these heroes to thank for a lot.

There is one thing that the Allied forces (in this case led by the US) did
wrong during the cleaning of Europe. The Dresden bombings. Dresden was not
a military target, so many German civilians fled there from more
industrial cities. The Allied forced bombed the city beyond recognition,
in order to lower the morale of the Germans.

Boy, did they succeed.

I meant the "far more healthy" in a very literal way when I wrote it. I
do not want to get wounded or killed, and I will do almost anything to
avoid it.

And yes, I would like the Swedish state to scrap the military forces
completely.

> Ask the Jews in Poland what life is like, when one\'s armed forces fail
> to defend one\'s nation.

See the comment on Hitler, above.

Now, let me make a few statements. First, I cannot and will not accept
what the US did to Japan at the end of the war. Japan was on the verge of
surrender, and they would have been out of the fight very shortly. The
butchery of almost two entire cities of civilians can not be defended in
any way. People are still having serious medical problems in the area
because of this.

Also, the US has a history stained by many other crimes against humanity.
The Vietnam war is a good example of this, and the crimes against the
native Americans (I know, that was a long time ago, but still) is another.

I must say that I do not respect the United States of America. Please do
not take that personally, but still that\'s my opinion.

As for Communism and other political stuff, I am myself far out in the
left field, and I am proud of it. I think it\'s a shame that the US only
shows one side of the coin, so to speak.

That\'s a social/political problem more than a technical one. We\'ve had
the technology for some time. And once past a certain point it would be
economical. It\'s just that nobody wants to do the "up front"
investments. 

If we were being visited by TL-12 aliens, and hearing about the
benefits they get from space resources, you can be damn sure the
investors would be shelling out money. And the governments would be
doing their damndest to get us out there so that we can claim the rest
of the system before some enterprising offworlders did.

That\'s sort of true. 

But *my* viewpoint is based on the fact that if anyone had been willing
to, they could have built a V2 in 1910, and gotten to the moon with
40s/50s tech. And the Space Shuttle is only TL6! Thus:

TL5	crude liquid fueled rockets, access to orbital *altitude* (but
	no capability of actually orbiting objects)
TL6	good liquid fueled engines. orbital installations,
	interplanetary flight, crude solid nuclear rockets
TL7	good solid nuclear engines, regular orbital flights,
	interplanetary installations
TL8	regular interplanetary flights, start of interplanetary colonies?
TL9	colonies

I left out the other fission rockets, and other propulsion
technologies, as I\'m not really sure how "hard" they are. But the above
is where *I* think the technologies should be. I don\'t have any recent
stuff that\'d list current "official" rules on this.

But I am sure that liquid fueled engines are TL5, and by late TL6 they
are approaching the theoretical limits (Space Shuttle Main Engines).

Likewise NERVA was TL6, and I have little doubt that if it hadn\'t been
abandoned, it\'d have been pushing the limits by the end of TL7. 

This *does* have interesting implications, in that a TL 5 planet *does*
have the capability of damaging a ship or satellite in low orbit.
Though the crew of the ship would have to be *grossly* negligent to let
their ship get hurt. And they can possibly build a "antipodal shuttle"
(the old Sanger design that skips off the atmosphere multiple times to
extend its sub-orbital range)

A TL6 planet would likely put a lot of effort into getting a reusable
ground to orbit craft and building a space station. It\'d be a matter of
planetary pride to be able to meet the *next* ship(s) in orbit after
the first visit by an IISS ship.

For TL6 spacecraft and installations, steal from the 50s space stuff.
The old von Braun and Ley designs *are* workable, and ought to impress
the players. Especially the old wheel-type stations. Most 50s SF used
those designs a *lot*. 

I wish I had my old Lindberg Line model kits of those designs (the
first re-issue). I have the space station kit from the *second*
re-issue. And I\'d also like to have the old Revell etc re-issues of 50s
designs (in the late 60s they re-issued a lot of 50s space kits under
new names). They\'d be great starting points for designs.

TL7 stuff is pretty much a lot of designs that never got built. And TL8
is current designs (again, many of which aren\'t going to get built).

One interesting TL7 design is the British Interplanetary Society\'s
Daedalus probe. This is a design that while pushing the limits a bit
was designed to be built with 60s or 70s tech. And it\'s for a probe
that will make a one-way trip to Alpha Centauri. 

Just imagine the fun at traffic control in a "fringe" system when they
detect a probe coming at 5% of c (or is it 1%?) from the next system
over. And the fun back at the launch site when they get the images from
their probe.

Yes, I\'d be nice and wait until *after* the data from the probe got
back before jumping in with the re-contact team.

I have friends in Boston, is their any chance of your please aiming it

Yes, I do. Let me explain why.

There are two neutral European states, Sweden and Switzerland. We have
been neutral for quite a long time now. Even Hitler (a far worse enemy
than Soviet) respected the neutrality of Switzerland, a very rich but
poorly defended country on the German border. Sweden is not a rich
country, even less so when compared to Switzerland.

Also, attacking a neutral state is extremely bad publicity for any state.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>. 
[Walter Smith]  
Switzerland was the only invasion Hitler called off. A plane carrying
a German officer went off course and crash-landed in Switzerland,
the officer was captured along with his documents detailing invasion
plans against Switzerland. 

The Swiss army executed very detailed defensive plans. Unless you
haven\'t noticed, Switzerland has the most defensible terrain in Europe.
Their entire male populace is also part of the military reserves
(and were mobilized). 

Switzerland wasn\'t left alone because Hitler was being nice.
Switzerland was left alone because the Swiss army would have
killed too many Germans. If Germany had been successful in taking
over Europe, Western Asia and Africa, Switzerland\'s days would
have been numbered.

Germany invaded a host of neutral nations during WWI and WWII.
They weren\'t stopped by any fear of world opinion.

Communism has a track record of murdering more people (by an
order of magnitude or so) than Hitler\'s people ever did. While
capitalism may bring out the worst in some people, Communism has
a history of taking the worst in people and making it state policy.

I\'d  heard a French head of state say that it was normal for young adults
to idealize Communism, and normal for them to grow out of it.
Maybe America only supports "one side of the coin", but in a 
Communist state you could be shot for even mentioning that there
were two sides to the coin.

Shadow,

Reading your posts made my (sometimes called warped) imagination kick in.
What type of systems WOULDN\'T be among the first to explore in an expanding
3I? Say long range scans showed a system without a suitable GG (Question: Do
all GG\'s contain hydrogen bearing atmospheres?) and a dry planet, would the
IISS pass this system up on the first go through an area? Most ship designs
I\'ve seen tend to run toward a single Jump (of whatever #) worth of fuel
storage. If there is a nice, fat, populated system nearby, with a couple of
GG, would they by-pass the less desirable real estate? How likely is it for
the IISS to specially fit out a ship to explore a system with no easily
recognizable signs of civilization? Would they even bother, until/unless
they recieved such a probe? And how long would that sytem sit, unvisited,
before the IISS did rigout a probe?

I\'m thinking of something along the lines of Moties here. What factors would
cause a "pocket" in or around the 3I that would NOT be explored until much
later in Imperial history?

PS: I\'m cc\'ing this to the TML, since I think that\'s the more appropriate
place for this discussion, since it\'s not really technical.

That\'s why I have to go to Boston myself, in order to guide it in, and if I

Oh, that\'ll be the least of it.  Let\'s not lose sight of the Sayats\' long
obsession with overbearing computer widgets, and their strongly-felt need to
help primitive sophonts grow to share in the benefits of civilization.

Nor in their long interest in biomedicine.  Hence the threat of the STV
overrunning Known Space.  Who -- besides a Sayat, I mean -- would want to run
into sexually transmitted Virus?

["drive crazy" -- interesting phrase.  Memo: new skill under Vechicle cascade]

It\'s the only surviving fragment of _Backstabbing Cowards_, a widely-marketed
serial holonovel from Makhidkarun, essentially anti-labor movement propaganda.
In each episode, the lonely archvillain Eneri comes one step closer to
completely destroying the entire Imperial economy with his fiendish plots,
only to be foiled by the good planning and liberal operational scope of
megacorporate security.  The text available to us apparently consists of Eneri
admonishing a younger inductee into the horrible plot: 

  "\'Save your hatred for working families," Eneri advised grimly."

And WHY do we only have one fragment of this literature which should be a
WARNING to us all?  Because the COMMUNISTS, true to their traditional,
INHERENT LUST for the mass murder of CUTE LITTLE FUZZY THINGS, have suprressed
Makhidkarun\'S RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH!  

Think about it!!

Outpost in Reavers\' Deep comes to mind.  It\'s about 5 parsecs out from the 
border in the middle of independent planets between the Carillians and the 
Caledonians.

Collin\'s World (Reavers\' Deep 1631) also comes to mind.  Here\'s the blurb from 
the old PE list:

LIBRARY DATA: Collin\'s World (Reavers\' Deep 1631).

This small airless world that was originally a reaver stronghold.  Later
turned legitimate and became an Imperial client state in return for letting
the Imperium maintain a base in the system.  Protected by Imperial ships and
given preferred trade status, Collin\'s World prospered and increased in
population to the point where the resources of the system was strained to
maintain it.

When the Imperial Navy pulled their ships out in 1119 it precipitated an
economic collapse.  By 1128 many of the habitats had failed in part or in
whole and nearly a hundred million people had died.

My site has been going some major changes.  One change is the inclusion of

accross my old TNE folder full of other gadgets and gismos for the TNE

ships will also be available.

In short, I will create a MULTI-Denominational traveller site!

X-TEK is still around, a complete history year 0-1116 is available.  I
havent gotten around to a TNE history yet.

Planet X is now the "Infonet" of x-TEK.

Larry Niven wrote a short story on this very theme, titled "Like Banquo\'s
Ghost."  In that one, though, the aliens aren\'t polite enough to wait.

I\'ve never been quite happy with the recurring circumstance in canon Trav
history of bustling interstellar communities not knowing what\'s in systems
only a few parsecs away.  Simple caution and curiosity would dictate
sending a few scouts out to do recon.  I would guess that any moderate to
high population, B+ starport world will have pretty good intelligence on
anything within a few months\' round-trip travel.  Doing basic surveys
costs relatively little, and can pay huge dividends if you discover a new
market, resource...or even enemy, before they discover *you*.  Even the
Vilani would be able to see the value in this, I think.  Hence the setup
for the Terran/Vilani contact has never made much sense to me.

There is a beautiful parallel in real Earth history, though.  Europeans
started sailing around the Carribean and along the coast of Mexico in
1492, and more and more ships and men were in the region with each passing
year, as forts and towns were established on the islands.  However, it was
nearly three decades later that \'first contact\' with the Aztec empire
occurred, despite the two large, well-organized, and curious powers having
been within a few hundred miles of one another the entire time.  So maybe
I\'m being too optimistic about exploration and curiosity driving early
contact.

Hi,

I am looking to take a vacation in the Rhylanor Star System sometime in the
next year. Do you have any information on the best carrier by which I can
book middle passage from Terra/Solomani Rim, hopefully stopping at
Sylea/Core and then following the old frontier routes through Corridor
sector to the Domain of Deneb. I believe Tukera Lines, LIC offers a
complete service, but I have always questioned their ethics. Perhaps you
could advise if one of the smaller lines such as Oberlindes would be better
value, and perhaps more morally sound? In addition, please advise which
insurance you would recommend as I am concerned about Vargr Pirates and the
ever present Zhodani threat.

Regards

Dom

PS The Traveller Mailing list is dedicated to the Traveller Science fiction
Roleplaying game - as a result, the only real travel offers likely to be
appreciated would be those involving space travel. Hope that helps, and
thank you for not spamming again.

Let\'s see: Norway, a neutral state, far poorer than Sweden at that time,
was invaded and held by German troops. Norway had a long, nice, ice-free
coastline and was thus important for the North-Atlantic theatre. Sweden on
the other hand was not invaded. First of all, Sweden hasn\'t the same
importance to the North-Atlantic theatre, secondly trains with
KZ-prisoners and German personell were allowed to pass through swedish
territory.  Sweden also kept up trading with Germany, so there simply was
no sufficiently good reason for attacking Sweden. They cooperated and did
not hold sufficiently important territories, why invade them? Respect for
the neutrality of a state had very little to do with it, I think.

> > Also, attacking a neutral state is extremely bad publicity for any

Obviously didn\'t affect Hitler&Co when Operation Weserübung was
implemented. (The invasion of Norway.)

After WWII the Swedish armed forces has cooperated widely with NATO
forces, especially Norwegian ones, of course. (Isn\'t that a strict no-no
for a neutral state, co-operating with NATO, that is? :] ) The fact that
NATO, and I\'m especially thinking of the American military presence, could
back up their words with military force had very much to do with Sweden
not being Hungary, I guess. (Not to be unfair to the Soviets: They marched
into Northern Norway towards the end of the war, we (the Norwegians) said
«Thank you very much for chasing the Nazis, we would like you to withdraw
your troops now.» The Soviets responded by withdrawal. The Russians were
very popular in Norway right after WWII.)

And as for myself, neither as right-wing as mainstream American politics,
nor a communist, find it a pity that some communists have such a sadly
selective memory.

A number listed in "The Gulag Archipelago" by Aleksandr Solshenitsyn is 66
million people dead in Russion prisoner camps, from 1917 to some time
after WWII. As for what the Asian communist regimes, China, Cambodia,
etc, have on their track records I can\'t site number off the top of my
head. The Nazi KZ-camps killed 8 million people, 6 millions of these Jews,
IIRC.

Well, the McCarthy Era and the Moscow processes can of course not be
compared, but it doesn\'t make it any better for the people who had their
lives destroyed in the States during the communist witch hunts.

During the ACW, most kinds of artillery fired canister (like a big
shotshell) at close range if necessary. The really feared weapon was the
12-pound Napoleon (smoothbore cannon; somethat outdated at that time). The
10-pound rifled gun (eg Parrot) threw about as much shot, but where the
Napoleon made a big deadly cone with it, the rifled guns threw it in
unpredictable twisting patterns. Instances were recorded of canister being
flung up and over attacking troops at a fairly close range. That\'s pretty
bad news for the artillerymen, BTW.

By definition, wouldn\'t rifling a shotgun make it a \'rifle\'? A poor one at
that. Better to keep shotguns as smoothbore shotguns (with special ammo for
unusual circumstances) and use a real, custom-designed rifle for rifle
work....

Your mistake here is that Soviet was not by definition a communist state -
it was a dictatorship. Communism only sounded good. The Nazi party in
Germany was a "worker\'s party" in the same way as Stalin was a communist.
I hate that man for dragging the good ideals of communism deep in the
dirt. To make things clear, I do not want a society like the old Soviet
Union.

Not so in Sweden. I know many people of most ages who are communists and
socialists. The normal political view in Sweden is to the left.

> Communist state you could be shot for even mentioning that there

No, but in a dictatorship you would. An important part of the communist
ideal is respect for other people\'s opinions.

Sums up what? That I belong to a younger generation with other political
views than the Oldboys?

You need to understand that I live in a country where politics in the left
field are commonly accepted, unlike in the US. Both of your major (ie only
power-wielding) parties are to the right, even more so than the Swedish
rightmost party (of the large ones, at least). There are somewhere between
five and ten major political parties in Sweden, with quite varying
agendas. I think that is a very good thing, as it makes people see more
than one side of the story.

I will not discuss this topic further, unless you choose to take it to
private mail.

Sadly, history is full of mistakes like this. The situation might flare
up, and my country might be invaded. In that case, I will leave it behind
if I have to. I will not fight and die for my country.

I agree. Let\'s take the entire discussion to private e-mail from now on.

Thank you. It\'s nice that someone understands what I am trying to say. You
never tell if you agree or not, but that does not matter.

Side note: I am 20 years old and I study at a University here in Sweden.
Sanders made a post hinting that my views were explained by the fact that
I am a student. I forgot to make some facts about myself clear in my reply
to that post.

Don\'t worry Jen, there are enough people around willing to protect you
that you\'ll not have to leave your nice, safe home. And since most
of them know what they do is important work, they\'ll not give too much
of a damn what you think of whether they ought to do it or not. Your

Is service in the 3i Navy all volunteer? How about the sector, subsector
navies? I\'ll assume that the local defense forces have compulsory service
at times, depending on the local government type and the current
situation. If the Sector Duke tells the ruler of Esperance to provide
half his troops to the Navy for invasion and garrison duties, the ruler
might install a draft to make up the lost manpower. Point: Will there
be situations where Draft Evasion is an Imperial Crime, perhaps on the
same level as Desertion?

Local color bits: Peace party demonstrations outside Imperial
installations (scout bases, starports, other places players go) can
make a nice backdrop for other events. If the demonstrators get 
irritable, it can make common player activities a bit more interesting.

Nobody in their right *minds* would want to go through Core.  What\'s wrong

I was gonna keep my mouth shut, but I changed my mind.

Jens has the right to decide whether or not he choses to take up arms for his 
country.  A lot of jobs in a country don\'t require military service, however, 
this does *NOT* mean these jobs are unimportant.  I read *ZERO* condescendence 
in his posts toward military personnel; he merely stated it just wasn\'t for 
him.  So be it.  I can respect that.

FWIW, I\'m a veteran of the U.S. Army, \'68 through \'72, and I almost went 
career.  I volunteered for it because I felt it was right for me to go.  So I 
did.

Been there, done that, & packed my uniform away when I got back to \'the 
world\', at least when I was off-post.

I don\'t see the 3I as drafting anyone for military service.  When you\'ve got 
trillions of citizens around, it shouldn\'t be hard to find a couple billion 
people who want to sign up.  As for reassigning Imperial forces and bringing 
Colonial forces into the Imperial ranks, yeah, I can see this, but I consider 
them to have previously volunteered.

Drafts on a *local* level to fill the void left by colonial units getting 
Imperialised, *that* I can see in a heartbeat.  Imperial regs probably don\'t 
cover Colonial forces.

I\'m a capitalist, plain and simple.  State socialism tends to foster the 
mediocre in that if you can\'t compete, the government steps in and forces the 
\'other guys\' to *let* you compete.  When your taxes keep getting higher and 
higher to pay for people who cannot or *will not* work, something is 
inherently wrong.  Pure classical capitalism says, level the playing field, 
and if you don\'t want to play on that field, go play in another game.  Let the 
market and the consumers decide.  Socialism says, we will *constantly* level 
the playing field so that nobody ever has a clear advantage.

FWIW, Sweden has some of the highest tax rates for personal income tax on the 
planet.  The upper middle class and the upper class tax rates are *killers*.

The final estimates for the Nazis was 11 million, of which 6 million were 
Jews, the rest Gypsies, trade unionists, Communists, Poles, and anybody else 
they were mad at.

The Khmer Rouge killed 3 million people from the time they took over in 1970 
until the Vietnamese ran them out in \'74.  Cambodia had a pre-Pol Pot 
population estimated at 6 million.  Figures suggest that the Vietnamese killed 
more in the first 3 years of a total Communist government than the Americans 
and South Vietnamese killed throughout the entire war, from 1960ish until 
1975, when the US finally pulled out.  They estimate that 30 million died 
under Stalin during World War 2.

Or the people in the Soviet republics gulagged for loyalty to the old nobility 
after the October Revolution.  Except for the American Revolution, the *first* 
thing a revolutionary party does the instant it has control is to purge the 
party of the very people who can overthrow it.  Hitler did it to the Brown 
Shirts.  Lenin did it to the Bolsheviks.  The French did it to *everybody*.

ObTrav:

This kind of stuff even happened in the Third Imperium during the Rebellion.  
More than one planet was bombed back into the Stone Age by the various 
factions.  Almost makes you proud to be an Imperial citizen, doesn\'t it?

The Islands Clusters subsectors (New Islands/Reft, Old Islands/Reft) were
uncontacted by the Imperium until 980, although they lie between the
Spinward Marches and the Imperial core.  Even then, the initial contact was
an Imperial strike cruiser (Eldorado) that misjumped there due to battle
damage sustained in the Third Frontier War.  Based on Eldorado\'s report,
the IISS mounted a return mission in 1013.  The Clusters are separated from
the nearest outside systems by 7-8 pc.  [Trillion Credit Squadron, p. 40-48]

We\'ve been over the Hiroshima/Dresden ground before, but....

True. The bombing of cities of full of innocents is morally \'wrong\'. But it
happens. You know why? Because somebody wants to take your land and maybe
your wife or daughter and all your possessions. maybe your home and your
life too. They probably have their reasons, but you don\'t care. You want to
stop them. Force is the only way that works, and thus it begins.

(BTW: SADDAM is not insane. He just doesn\'t think like me or you.)

Violence has a way of escalating until either the horror grows so great
that it is unbearable, and someone breaks, or there is nothing left. So we
start with a \'clean\' war - just volunteer soldiers being killed. Well, they
knew the risks when they signed up says public opinion. But pretty soon
someone decides that total war is the only way. Attack the means of
production, destroy civilian morale, that kind of thing. The whole thing
snowballs from there. It can\'t be controlled.

Why? Because I can\'t stop the other side from bombing my civilians - except
by surrender or victory. And if I won\'t do the decent thing and surrender,
what choice has the opposing side? They must go on, because they can\'t stop
me bombing their cities except by surrender or victory. 

I can\'t make the other side stop fighting unless I break their will. Their
actions are beyond my control. But   I have the lives of the people on MY
side to worry about, too. And I CAN do something for them. I can break the
will of the enemy - make him stop fighting. 

Conventional bombing of cities won\'t achieve that. (Tactical strikes by
light aircraft eg the Mosquito were far more effective than carpet-bombing
in WWII for the destruction of  enemy war-making capability - ie factories
and such. But public opinion in Britain demanded the heavy bombers -
vengeance incarnate, retribution for Coventry and London etc). Carpet
bombing didn\'t break anyone\'s morale, though it did tie manpower and
production down into anti-aircraft defences which didn\'t work all that well
but were necessary to keep morale up. Thus two largely ineffective weapons
in WWII cancelled one another out, pretty much. As a sideline, they killed
hundreds of thousands of civilians and thousands of airmen. But nothing
much was actually achieved. Just death and destruction.

Nuclear bombing might work.

Fact: The firebombing of Tokyo killed more people ON THE SAME NIGHT as the
first nuclear attack. Yet the nuclear bomb pretty much ended the war. Was
it right? Who cares? Throw away your conceptions of right and wrong and
think about this for a minute.

The war had to end. There were 2 ways - invade the Japanese homeland,
fanatically defended by Sleeping Dragon*, suicide aircraft and God knows
what else. The cost in American and Japanese lives would be immense. OR
drop the bomb.

A horrible choice, but the bomb option might raise the horror stakes to the
point where the Japanese would give in. Truman chose it. Maybe because he
couldn\'t get the other lot to stop fighting any other way, so he did that
to save the lives that were under his command - you could even say he had a
moral duty to do that. A duty to the men under his command, to preserve
their lives as best he could.

Dropping the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki wasn\'t a great solution. It
wasn\'t even a good one. But it WAS a solution. That was what was needed.
Truman grasped the nettle and did what seemed like the best option at the
time. 

Right or wrong? I don\'t know. Yes I do - wrong, but less so than fighting
on. Because you can\'t take responsibility for the people on the other side.
You look out for your own people, and if someone won\'t stop fighting you
then you finish it, for the good of the people you CAN do some good for. 

Altenratively, you surrender. Because that will be good for the people on
the other side. And JUST POSSIBLY your own. But history does not show this
to have been a very good bet at any time.

Debating the rights and wrongs of it all is pointless. Fact it, these
things happened. we\'d be better to try to understand why, and make damn
sure it never happens again. THAT, I feel, would be \'right\'.

War is a horrible thing. But since I can\'t control the actions and
intentions of others, and because in this flawed and dirty world we live in
you can\'t rely on the goodwill of others - world opinion and condemnation
mean nothing in the face of determined armed aggression - I am humbly and
profoundly glad that there are men and women willing to face danger to
protect me and my way of life.

I would rather my great-uncle, killed in a torpedo boat action in the
Channel (posthumous DSO IIRC), my grandfather, his health destroyed by
mortar bomb fragments at Dunkirk and my friend, badly injured by a
terrorist bomb in Northern Ireland - and all the others - had served out
their days in peace as an expensive national trophy and nothing more. 

Better, I would rather they had never had to serve at all.

But for them, and the others I don\'t know, I can only say that I am
profoundly glad that they and others like them were there when they were
needed. Sadly, they will be needed again. Until Humankind grows up and
stops this pointless conflict altogether - not any time soon, I fear - they
will be needed.

\'For your Tomorrow
We gave our Today\'

It will happen again. 

Unless we stop it.

character generation (any version) - so presumably the 3I navy isn\'t all
volunteer. Unless you assume that the draft is local colonial fleets &
COACC forces. 

My take on the Traveller draft is that citizens go through a sort of
clearing process at 18 or so. Those with jobs or universities to go to, or
who pay an \'admin fee\' don\'t get selected. Of the rest, a proportion are
ignored (maily low-techers) to do whatever they can with their lives, the
rest get drafted into some service. This could be military service for the
Imperium (Scouts, Marines, Army, Navy), local forces (Colonial fleets,
COACC, planetary forces), or non-military service, eg Merchant Navy,
Administration, Labour Corps or som sort of humanitarian (sapientarian?)
aid programme.

That gives us a few adventure ideas - characters at 18 get drafted into
Imperial Projects, which turns out to be pushing paper or shovelling animal
droppings. (I had an uncle who, while on national service, volunteered for
PS Duty, trying to impress someone I guess. \'PS DUTY\' turns out to be \'Pig
Shit Duty\' - he spent several weeks cleaning out pig poo....) Characters
are offered an alternative - just fulfil this slightly dodgy mission and in
return we\'ll transfer you out of here....

Or draftees assigned to the \'Underpriviliged Children of the Imperium
OUtreach Project\' - babysittinga whole mob of tearways at summer camp. Now
wouldn\'t that have you itching for a nice safe reactor faiure or Frontier

As an aside - ever wonder why the Greenham Common bunch got so het up about
a bunch of low-yield cruise missiles when there were 72 Zigglion Big Soviet
Missiles pointing the other way? It had something to do with all the money
the KGB paid to keep the protests going.....

The 0 and 1 indicate that the second hex is 0 subsectors trailing/spinward

All gas giants contain significant amounts of water, if our
understanding of planetary formation is correct. Hydrogen isn\'t a
problem. Getting at it may be, though.

It may be easier for the IISS to bypass \'unfavourable\' systems, but is
there really such a thing ? Why couldn\'t you refuel in the system\'s Oort
cloud, for example - (a cometary halo is probably more likely to be
present than any planets). Travel time is longer, but surveying is (one
of) the Scout\'s primary mission(s).

Regrettably, response time is a function of bureaucracy and the distance
to the nearest C3I point. I\'d suspect most IISS field commanders would
be very canny (pick your favourite fictional example) and would tend to
act largely independently under service mandate to get around this
problem...

Isolation in Traveller is a function of jump technology. \'Pockets\' in
the Imperium would be separated by (mini or mega-)rifts, e.g. the Domain
of Deneb.

You\'d love the bit we\'ve come up with over on the tech list. Short

Assassin pulls gun, gets spotted, and a *small* meson discharge either
scrambles his heart/brain (if you are rushed) or blows away his gun

No more worrying about people being in the line of fire.

And a modified version is great for impressing the natives on low tech

All gas giants are 90%+ hydrogen. It\'s the only thing in the universe

Well, they\'d have to have not produced a lot of radio/radar traffic.
It\'s been calculated that some of our larger radar systems will be
clearly detectable as artifical signals for 5-10 parsecs!

Well, as I note in another message, there was a reason i made it a
fringe area. Preferrably with the world with Imperial presence being a
sort of "boom town" due to a major mineral strike. 

Under the right circumstances, I can see a scout discovering something
like this, and either being at the end of a exploration sweep, or close
enough to the end that he decides this is a good reason to head back. 

So he gets back, the news gets out, and meanwhile, the next sweep  of
the area happens to have that adjacent system at the end of the sweep.
So it could be a couple of *years* before that system gets visited, and
in that time, the system with the "big strike" could have grown into
someplace fairly large.

  Considering how much (a very great deal) Traveller warships cost per
crewmember required (at least in CT/HG) it seems extremely unlikely that
conscription would be necessary in the 3I or most of its contemporaries.
The same would likely apply to almost every conceivable Imperial service,
with the possible exception of the Army which would depend on how you see
their labour pool being raised.

  E.G. - the ultimate Yanks in space comparison; 300 million (3x10E8) people
at TL 14 (GDP per capita KCr 20), with a 5% military budget is MCr 300,000,
or enough to maintain a force in being of around ten Tigress equivalents
(call it 5 megatons of warships) with a total crew requirement of maybe 50,000
or, plus another 50-100 K in support personnel (note that extensive support
staffing is wildly non-canonical, particularly with respect to fully staffed
engineering and maintenance departments - see pages 32-33 in B5 HG).

  Even if the parent society were decidedly non-violent you should still be
able to scrape up a hundred thousand adventurous, non-conformist, or thrill-
seeking youngsters without too much trouble, at least if they were anything
closely recognizable as culturally human by the standards of the last five
hundred years.

  While I doubt that the Empire would be thrilled about subjects evading
required duty with planetary forces, it certainly wouldn\'t be evasion of
Imperial service as such (assuming that compulsory Imperial service would
be rare, and more likely to involve personnel with specific skills than
simple warm bodies - i.e., Dr. Krenstein might be important, but another
ten Marine divisions are easy to fill, if not train).

  Drafting replacements of levied units sounds plausible, but depends on
circumstances and background assumptions; I don\'t recall fow Mr. Berry\'s
essay on the IA treated this.

  IIRC, some of the German Left actually refused to participate and then
tried to end the Great War immediately, and I doubt that such a large
conflict to serve so little purpose can be found elsewhere in history.
While it\'s true that this attitude wouldn\'t have helped in Manchuria or
Czechoslovakia, the oft-touted conventional approach was a complete
disaster in 1914.

  Perhaps it\'s a question of actions and beliefs being appropriate to
the circumstances of the day. As someone pointed out, the Rebellion
would have fizzled completely if the IN had largely collectively decided
that their loyalties lay with the concept of the Imperium as a whole
rather than opting for their particular causes (region, race, lord, or
career as the case may be).

  Of course, given the writers\' knowledge of that fact it can be assumed
that the MT era Imperium was being defined as a rotted out shell, in terms
of its identity as a polity.

 Jens, you are probably a well meaning sort. I am caustic
in my response because you haven\'t quite thought out your
stance. Bless you for having the concept that a man is responsible
for his neighbor. But you mistake the value of liberty, it is not
something given, if it were it would have no worth. It has to be
bought, and unfortunately for you the coin is blood.
Even Ghandi put himself in harm\'s way.

Those who serve in the military generally have a sense of duty and face the 
prospect of death or injury (usually only in an abstract sense), for this these 
people deserve respect as _individuals_. But then again so do nurses, 
teachers, doctors and a host of other professions, they all deserve just as 
much respect. However let us not forget that war in all its "glory" is a crime 
against humanity and if it were not for those who serve in silence it could not 
exist. There are no "fortunes of war" just unmitigated horror. Nor should we 
forget that the greatest threat faced by any democracy is from its own military, 
far more democracies have persished on the bayonets of their own army than 
have ever fallen under the boots of an invader.

Answer me this, who deserves greater respect: the private who fell on Omaha 
beach or the quaker who perished in Dachau? [answer: both are equally 
deserving].

  Gee, I\'d have thought the Supreme Court decision on the constitutionality
of Quebecs\' potential separation would be of local interest only :)

  More seriously, the flexibility of the Imperium wasn\'t that bad (e.g.
allowing the establishment of the Solomani Autonomous region to defuse
tensions - OC, it didn\'t work). The problem in MT appears to have been 
that Dulinor decided that his opening position was incompatible with
Strephon and that negotiation was undesirable.

  It starts to make the Vargr look reasonable.

  Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that "pure classical capitalism
says we will do _whatever it takes_ to ensure that the playing field will
never be level again". That said, I\'m a capitalist* (not that there\'s been a
pure capitalist state in North America these last fifty years). In practical
terms the "capitalist" system has a history (everywhere in the West) of using
various state resources (intentionally or through criminal misappropriation)
to re-allocate wealth and income for various reasons.

  True, but their infant mortality rates aren\'t too embarassing.

  That said, the issue obviously becomes one of values, for which it
might suffice to say that the 3I is based on the (not unreasonable,
IMO) assumption that capitalist market mechanisms are deemed to be
_correct_ models for economic purposes. The Imperium itself is neither a
grand republic nor a market democracy, and doesn\'t really seem to much
care whether its\' inhabitants have those privileges.

  It might not be too cynical to suggest that the Imperium itself is a
representation of the principle that power is an end in itself, again
on the assumption that this is true for the purposes of discussing the
Imperium in the OTU (which point is not stated anywhere, it\'s just my
own meandering thought on the subject).

  See above :) - if the Empire assumes that little other than power matters in
practical terms (the theory must have received barest lip-service [inopportune
phrase, that] for the Rebellion to have slagged the Imperium so thoroughly)
then the outcome was almost predictable once the (very stable?) command 
structure was decapitated.

        1a) Rifling would improve slug accuracy.

        Many shotgun manufacturers have optional "slug gun" barrels
        which are rifled for improved accuracy. However, it is also
        possible to fire air-rifled slugs from smoothbore cylinder
        barrels. The air-rifled slugs have rifling-like vanes on the
        sides which induce spin. (I have been using air-rifled Fiocchi
        Brennekens (sp?) with my 12-gauge Benelli S90 M3. The slugs
        appear to be quite accurate.)

        1b) If proper shotshells are used, rifling will not be
        damaged. However, old shotshells and iron shot would probably
        damage rifling.

        If felt-plug shot (that is, very old shotshells) is fired
        from slug barrel, the shot pattern will usually become
        tighter since the shot will bounce off the rifling towards
        the center of barrel (old way to tighter the shot pattern
        was to make scratches and notches inside the barrel, but
        fortunately this method is not used anymore)

        In modern shotshells the shot is packed inside a plastic cup
        which falls off when the shot exists from barrel. This cup
        prevents shot from touching the barrel walls and damaging the
        rifling of slug guns.

> 2)  Would adding a truly frictionless surface to the inside of the
> barrel help or hurt such a weapon?

        Frictionless barrel would be a great advantage on any gun,
        and recent designs are striving towards less friction. Large
        amount of the heat generated during firing comes from bullet/
        barrel friction.

        Some modern low-friction designs include electrolyte erosion
        to smoothen the edges of rifling, polygonal rifling to minimize
        barrel inner surface area, lubricated bullets, barrel coatings,
        ceramic barrels, etc.

> 3)  At what temperature do modern 9mm cased powder pistol rounds start
> cooking off?

        3) Depends on the type of propellant used. The only estimate
        I was able to find suggested that rounds would begin to cook
        off at 500°C temperature.

        An easy way to prevent cook-off is to use open-bolt receiver
        which chambers the round just prior to firing. Some weapons
        can switch between the modes of operation, firing full-auto
        with open-bolt and single shots with closed-bolt.

> 4)  Can non-cased rounds cook off? (I believe Germany\'s ground forces

        4) They do cook-off, but not as easily as cased rounds.

        "Due to the cook-off temperature of the new propellant charge,
         approximately 100°C higher than for nitrocellulose powder, a
         cook-off point meeting the requirements of a new infantry
         weapon can be achieved."

I *was* going to stay out of this, but I couldn\'t. ;-)

You may well be right about the tax rate (it\'s certainly high), but then, in
Sweden it doesn\'t wreck one\'s economy beyond all saving if one has the bad
taste to get a serious, long-lasting, incapacitating illness that requires
constant hospital care and heavy medication. I see the Swedish taxes as a
lottery. Sure, the tickets *are* kind of expensive, but the jackpot (that
you don\'t really want to win ;-) can *easily* be worth several thousand a
day...

>  The upper middle class and the upper class tax rates are *killers*.

Um, no. I believe I\'m part of the upper middle class, and I make a very nice
living thank you. And the upper class generally have professional tax
evaders to make sure they don\'t actually have to pay for the services they
somehow forget to refuse using...

Now, I wouldn\'t *mind* lower taxes. Unless, of course, it meant that only
the truly rich can afford care, that the schools are neglected, that we get
a huge underclass, etc.

This is not to say that the Swedish system is perfect, because it *isn\'t*,
not by a long shot. It\'s just that it\'s not a horrible, evil
commie-mutant-bastard system run by power-mad taxmen either. Just like the
US isn\'t a horrible, evil, culturally imperialist robber baron capitalist
system run by warmongering lechers. ;-)

I will add them to my TNS-Library, where they are sorted chronologically, 
as they are sorted by date entry. I also don\'t know another way.
It would be interesting to calculate the time it takes the messages to
arrive at various worlds via the x-boat net. That\'s always been considered
in the TNS publication, and is part of the Traveller universe as we know
it. Hopefully it will keep this way.

We had a tense 15 minutes once. I was firing a friend\'s SKS and I pulled
the trigger and nothing happened. So I had everybody get well back and
just barely opend the bolt. Yep, there was a cartridge case peering out
at me. 

I *slowly* closed the action, and we tried several times to get it to
fire. No joy.

So we finally let it sit for a while (pointed downrange), and then
opened it (while trying to stay out of the direct flight path of any
pieces if the cartridge went off).

We finally got the casing out to discover that it was *empty*.
Apparently a bit of grit had kept it from ejecting, so instead of
loading a new cartridge, the old one had gotten shoved back into the
chamber. If I hadn\'t been doing rapid-fire I\'d have caught it.

But like I said, that was one *scary* quarter hour.

I agree with this.  

Someone posted that ITTU they believed that the draft rules indicated a 
draft.  I think the draft rules are only that:  rules designed so that 
someone can begin a career to gain skills.  I don\'t think it translates 
into an Imperial draft at all.  Maybe there are provisions for 
Sector/Subsector levies in the event of the next Frontier/Solomani 
/Vargr/Aslan war, but not imperium wide.  I think that billions of folks 
would see Imperial service as a way to get off the planet and out into 
life... like [ducks] Luke Skywalker.

Yep.  And maybe even in emergencies, prior service personnel (scouts, 
navy, marine), or heck, maybe even merchant captains can be "pressed" 
into service for a period.  Probably lots of powers granted to local 
Imperial force commanders...

No, the melting point of gun barrel steel is over a thousand degrees Centigrade.  I\'m not sure *exactly* what it is, but I used to work in a foundry making cast bronze, which melts around 1800 Farenheit, and we used steel tools to skimm the dross off the molten bronze.  They didn\'t melt unless you held them into the bottom of the \'pot\'.  The barrel will lose its temper maybe, but it won\'t melt.

Yep, I most certainly agree here.  We must respect human life, and treat 
others with dignity, as we would want to be treated.  This is a general 
rule of life.

We\'ll disagree here.  If it is a "crime against humanity", and I\'m not 
conceding that point, then the perpetrators of the crime must be 
punished.  That is why we had a WWII:  the perpetrators of the crimes, 
those who started the wars, were punished.  And that created the horrors 
of war.  They were, in most cases, brought on by the belligerents 
themselves.

I believe there are "just" wars...and that such wars should be fought.

Not to mention a popcorn kernel at worst will take out an eye.

One more thing, I saw the movie "Lethal Weapon 4" Wednesday night; it

*much* higher?

BTW, thanks to everyone who replied to my previous four questions. You\'ve 
all helped tremendously (as always)!

But if that kernel happens to be one of those Orvil Redinbocker pre

I\'m not sure about this one.  The only weapon that *I* know of that can
effectively used under water with no problems is the Glock series of
handguns.  I remember visiting a guy\'s website where he took quite a few
pictures of him firing his Glock while fully submerged in a large tank of
water.  You might be able to find the URL by doing a web search...

	From the point of view of an economist Sweden has just chosen a 
different risk/return trade-off than the U.S.  Think of it this way: in 
the stock market you can invest in risky technology stocks that could 
make you rich or broke, or you can invest in stable "blue-chip" stocks 
like GE & Ford that won\'t make you rich but will provide a safe, 
predictable, if modest, return.
	The U.S. has chosen a path like investing in the tech stocks.  
Individuals can become billionaires or live in cardboard boxes.  Sweden 
has chosen to be like the blue-chips where no one makes it big but 
everyone\'s well taken care of, too.  As long as both countries are 
functioning democracies neither really has the right to criticize the other.

ObTrav:  The government types in Trav have always represented quite a of 
diversity, but the economic system is never really mentioned.  Worlds 
with a democratic government could vary from Jens\' pacifist Marxist 
paradise all the way to unrestrained libertarian capitalism, and as long as 
these systems have the support of the people they\'re all democracies.

>  They estimate that 30 million died under Stalin during World War 2.

	No doubt Stalin was a monster, but how many of these 30 million 
should properly be laid at the feet of Hitler?  It\'s worth remembering 
that while the West likes to think of D-Day as the nail in the Nazi 
coffin, it was the Soviet people that destroyed Hitler\'s finest -- at great 
cost to themselves.

Stop and think about it a minute. You want to know the best example of
pure, parket driven, no state-interference capitalism on the planet?

The Mob.

They are subject to NO legal restraints in the conduct of their
business, other than the big one that their business is illegal. No OSHA
rules, no EPA rules, no IRS, no Justice department anti-trust rules,
nada. Pure money-driven capitalism. They do whatever it takes to
maintain and extend their markets.

You wanna live in _THAT_ society?

And in your definition of pure capitalism, you say \'level the playing
field\'. How, pray tell, do you do that? If the Government does it, how
is that different from your definition of socialism. If the Government
doesn\'t do it, what prevents the eventual consolidation of all power
into a few monopolies?

Remember all that eeeevil socialist anti-trust welfare state handholding
laws we\'ve got here in the US weren\'t passed in response top some
do-gooders whims, but in response to very real and very destructive
business practices arising directly out of the great capitalist lazziez
faire atmosphere of the 1800\'s.

Finally, if you don\'t like living in Sweden, don\'t. While socialist is a
filthy word in modern American conservative politics, there are many
places on the planet where they don\'t regard the amassing of capital as
the sole important goal in life. It boggles capitalists minds when the
run into people from places like Sweden or Denmark where there is a very
strong community nurturing ethos, where the fortunate are obligated to
care for the less fortunate. 

The prevailing conservative thought in US politics is "I got _mine_
Jack! Sod off! Sink or swim. Dog eat dog. If you can\'t swim with the
sharks, get out of the pool." This is as abhorrent to their way of
thinking as their state socialism is to you. But think, they have a
higher literacy rate, lower crime rate, lower infant mortality rate,
higher per capita income than the US.

Here we place great emphasis on the rights of the individual to achieve
as much as they can, with little emphasis on what that individual owes
society for their success. We idolize the \'self-made millionaire\'
without ever realizing that there\'s no way in hell that person got where
they did without a hell of a lot of support form the community,
somewhere. What we don\'t have here is as stong a feeling of \'giving
back\', of repaying the community for the success you\'ve achieved,
because we maintain this fiction that all of it was done by individual
will alone. 

This is all _utterly_ relevant to traveller, because we have on one
hand, the pure market-driven capitalism that is the cornerstone of the
Third Imperium. What of the other points of view. Does the Imperium just
ride roughshod over them? Or is that the basis of Honor that was so
important to Cleon..is the concept of nobliesse oblige strong enough to
temper the excesses of capitalism, at least until the Imperium
self-destructs in the Rebellion?

I assume this question is aimed at the TML readership in general.

For me, the answer is "You *BETCHA*!"

I\'m a vet and son of a vet.  I\'d die for my family and friends,
I\'d die for my principles, my country, and my way of life.

If this sounds pompous, consider: I wasn\'t drafted.  I *enlisted*
in the USMC.  I volunteered to serve EOD duty.  Although there were
no active military excursions during my hitch (in the mid-70s), we
were all ready and willing.

Do I *want* to die.  Of course not.  Do I think there are some things
in this world more important than my life?  Absolutely.

Been there, done that. :^)  BTW, for those of you will little or no
firearms experience, Leonard\'s description of the steps taken when
a round apparently fails to fire are *exactly* correct.  Hangfires
will usually go off in 2-3 minutes, if they are going to fire at all.
If they don\'t fire after that time, you can carefully open the action
and remove the defective round.

18 out of 438 worlds in the Marches are considered "Important".
These worlds support the long-haul trade for this subsector.

A big suprise for me is that Gram is quite a powerful world, 
rated higher than Regina and even with Rhylanor and Strouden.
Of course, Trin and Mora are no surprise.

Looking at specific routes, I\'d say the long-haul routes follow
X-Boat jumproutes (which are more likely to be constantly patrolled).
So, for example, we have, in Xboat-jump-distances:

	Efate    -4- Regina 
	Regina   -7- Rhylanor
	Rhylanor -1- Porozlo
	Rhylanor -5- Lunion
	Lunion   -2- Strouden
	Lunion   -4- Fornice
        Lunion   -5- Mora
	Mora     -1- Fornice
	Mora     -6- Trin
	Fornice  -5- Trin
	Strouden -6- Trin
	Pallique -2- Fornice
	Pallique -3- Mora

How exactly is a sector capital (with all other attributes identical) less
important than a subsector capital?  I suspect you aren\'t scanning for Cx, just
Cp ;)

Yes, we too in Ireland beleive that if you get sick, the state should be
there to support you rather than let you die on a curbside somewhere.
If you can\'t find work, the State won\'t let you starve either. Sure, some
people take advantage of this, but the alternative is either heniously
complex or else uncaring.
The free education, including College, doesn\'t hurt either.

What I noticed when visiting Sweden is that although the taxes made the
goods about twice as expensive, the average salaries were much higher as
well. (If only Ireland would catch on to the latter half!)

>This is not to say that the Swedish system is perfect, because it *isn\'t*,
Neither is the Irish by a long shot. They waste _so_ much money. The could
have taxes if they just got their act together.
It is hard to build a good socialist country. It requires people with more
of a mind for others than themselves. Idealists. Captialism is founded on
indifference to your fellow man, and self promotion. Much more common
traits in society.

Well, not exactly.

Capitalism is founded on personal responsibility and enlightened
self-interest (though some may call it\'s enlightenment a bit dim <g>). 

One thing missing in the current form of capitalism practiced in the US
is the social responsibility aspect. I think that as we have seen the
central government take up social welfare causes (and tax people to
do it), the social responsibilty ethic has withered. Why spend time,
money and effort to help others when the government is already taking
your hard-earned money to do so? A result has been a disdain for
charitable and socially responsible acts. Government responds by
helping more people (and helping people more), taxing and taxing to
do so, the aggravation by those who see themselves as supporting
everyone else increases. A vicious circle, on and on, even with those
who benefit from government aid adding to the discontent by claiming
their gov\'t assistance as an entitlement.

<Apostasy warning>
A recent bit of support for this: During the Reagan era war on taxes,
charitable donations went up in almost direct ratio to tax cuts. 
Of course, gov\'t tax revenues went up as well (people made a lot
more money, a slightly lesser percent tax on a lot more money
equals higher tax revenue after a tax cut).

<ObTrav>
Take a balanced society. Add a distant government (say, the 3i) that
takes over an important aspect of that society - defense, research,
social welfare, whatever. Make the 3i\'s involvement compulsory,
non-responsive to local interests, and burdensome. Then, one day
out of the blue, remove the Imperial involvement (Rebellion, anyone?)

Quite possibly, the influenced aspect of the society will have fallen into
disfavor with the populace - say "Scientist" has become synonymous
with "Impy Lapdog". Scientists would have a long, hard road before
being accepted into society again, before they gained support, before
anyone brought up their kids with dreams of being a scientist.
The society will have a hole in it, it\'ll be like a car engine with a piston
missing. The damage may take generations to recover, if it isn\'t
enough to usher the world into a long night.

(btw: the first paragraph of ObTrav is based on USgov\'t economic reform
programs of the 1930\'s great depression, which according to some
views were so mismanaged that they made the problem worse, 
before being abandoned.)

Don\'t blame us.  It\'s those darn Brits and their Empire that spread English
around the world.

To be honest, I tried to learn German while in the Army.  The few times I
made it to Germany and tried to practise, the locals spoke perfect English
and it was quicker to use my language.

By the way, I daily hear English, Cantonese, Spanish, and Japanese in my
home city of Mission de San Francisco de Assasi y Pueblo de Yerba Buena.
I\'ve even picked pieces of some of these.

This is unreal.  The Japanese continued resisting *after* the second bomb!
When the Emperor ordered the surrender, there was an abortive coup attempt
to force the war to continue.

People are still having medical problems?  Tough.  They started it.  We
finished it.  I learned a very long time ago that if you start a fight you
better be ready to accept the consequences.  The Japanese committed
atrocities on the Chinese, captured prisoners, Koreans.. anyone who got in
their way.  There is no evidence they were ready to surrender until we
demostrated the ability and will to devastate entire cities from a single
plane.

The Imperium expects planets to raise armies for their own defence.  A
certain, small percentage of these troops are organized as Imperial units,
and get high tech equipment and intensive training.

Those Imperial Regiments are paid for out of the Imperial coffers, but
remain on their homeworld (until needed.)  All the locals pay is the cost
of maintaining the bases.  In return they get a core force of high tech
troops.

It\'s inconvenient, to be sure, but maybe not as bad as you think.
In combat many (well, *most*) range safety rules are simply ignored.
If a "round in battery, failure to fire" occurs, the standard drill
is cycle the action, verify (if possible) that the round ejected
and a fresh round entered the chamber, and get back on the trigger.
After the battle, (assuming you survive) you can complain to the
QM (Ord.) about defective MilSpec ammo. :^)

Commercially, Glisten may be the busiest system in the Marches.  Under
the trade rules used in MT and later, its trade codes give it basically
the maximum possible bonuses as a source of cheap, high-tech goods.  In
addition, since it\'s an asteroid belt, the time to maneuver in normal
space will be cut way, way down too.  It\'d be a great base for players.

Yes.  But why throw England in with the other European
countries?Because, as I mentioned at least briefly in another post,
England
has moved away from its own Common law traditions.  Since the 60s,
it is not bound by precedent.  And some of the EU treaties and laws
have significantly changed the operation of English law.  While it
may not be immediately visible, it is changing.

At least in most legal academic literature, the "Civil" code systems and
the
"Romano-Germanic" system are synonomous.  I have no idea why some people

use one term or the other, but in non-American literature,
"Romano-Germanic"
seems to be more prevalent in my experience.  Apologies for any
confusion.

If this seems at all odd, let me briefly explain.  The "Civil" code
systems are so
called because they are based, at least philosophically on the code of
laws
compiled by, or under the rule of, Justinian.  Commonly referred to as
the
Justinian Code, the actual title is something like the Codex Civilus
something,
etc, (actual title escapes me).  Thus, the Roman part of
Romano-Germanic.
The Germanic part I\'ve let slip out the ol\' kettle.

I agree almost completely.  IMHO, adversarial representation is not
mutuallyexclusive of Civil code and/or Inquisitorial systems.  At one
time or another,
you can find different combinations of these factors throughout history,

and some still present today.   Russia is an example that comes to mind
with
a hybrid adversarial/inquisitorial system for crimes.  Also, some Common

law courts are not adversarial, and this practice has been growing,
albeit
not yet in significant measures, though not criminal courts.

IMHO, what defines the Civil Code is the attempt to fully legistlate for
all
circumstances with comprehensive codes, and the freedom from predecedent

to decide each case independently, even if factually identical.
Conversely,
the keystone of the Common Law is that judges may find the law through
the case.  But once found, they must adhere to it.  Common Law generally

refers to "judge-made" law and in legal parlance, we speak of courts
filling
gaps the legistlature left in its laws.  More succinctly, common law
courts
will make a law where there isn\'t one, and civil code courts will
interpret
what laws they have to cover any situation they encounter.

Who is the trier of fact or the trier of law can be changed in either
system
without destroying the inherent distinctions.  So too with adversarial
or
inquisitorial criminal justice.  These are merely different methods to
implement whatever philosophical approach is desired.

I\'ll have to check the Warrant of Restoration, but I think this hair
splitting isunnecessary.  IIRC, the Emperor\'s the law maker, Moot or no
Moot.
I guess the Moot is moot.   :-P

Again I agree, wrt Barons, but I call it Imperial Distric Court and
there is at least oneper system.

I have a Subsector Court of Appeals, and then appeal by leave as you
have it.

> Aquitals can only be appealed on the grounds of purjury.

I don\'t limit the possible remedy.  IMO, a Duke, etc., can completely
dismiss,
vacate, reverse, remand or alter the remedy of any case appealed to him.

So, you might risk a worse result by appealing.  However, Dukes would
very rarely be interested enough to make so radical a departure from the

court\'s judgment.

I allow nobles to reach down and take a case out of the court system
and decide it themselves if necessary.  Here\'s the scenario I see,
for dramatic purposes at least.  Joe Wildman kills Tom Softskull with
a lucky shot in a bar brawl.  He is tried and sentenced to death.
Duke Whatshisname hears about this just in time to stop the
execution.  The Duke steps in, declares that Joe is needed for
services to the Duke and the Imperium, and lifts the sentence.
Of course, if Joe gets out of line, the Duke can reinstate the
sentence and carry out the punishment immediately.

	I agree with everything else you said, and the literacy, crime, 
and infant mortality stats are all correct, but I have to quibble with 
the statement about income.  I can\'t help it, I\'m an economist and that 
makes me a little compulsive :-)

	Not only does the US have wider extremes of wealth than any other 
advanced nation, it also has higher _average_ wealth than any other 
nation.  Of course, if you take out Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Hong 
Kong which don\'t really count, then Canada is second to the U.S. and some 
people might find that they have struck a better balance than we 
Americans have.

	Again, as a professional economist, I have to differ.  The 80s 
economic boom had far more to do with falling oil prices, the taming of 
inflation, and massive economic stimulus in the form of deficit 
spending than any tax cut.  Reagan had nothing to do with the first, 
actually made the second far more difficult, and was very much 
responsible for the third even though it was nothing more than 
Keynesianism which he professed to despise.  
	BTW, we currently spend more money just covering the *interest* 
on the national debt than we do on the military.  If we hadn\'t spent all 
that money in the 80s, imagine the tax break we could have *now*.

Totally pedantic point here, but IIRC centigrade only runs between 0 and
100 deg. Celcius runs from -273 upwards.

Interesting information on the steel though.

Thanks for the correction...as soon as I sent it, I had second thoughts
about those numbers...

But, I\'d like to play devils advocate here a bit.

A major component of those societies is also a high degree of importance
being placed on conformance to the group. Much like Japan, those who
stick out, tend to be viewed as nails to pound in not leaders to
emulate. This is another thing that makes many people, particularly
Americans quite uncomfortable in these societies. (and vice versa)

This makes them much more like a dominant cultural component in the 3I,
particularly the Core area..those Vilani all over the place. 

We really have to understand what the effects of such a long-lived
culture of absolute conformity would have on the trillions of beings in
the old Ziru Sirka. Even though Solomani \'Yanks in spaaaaaccceee\' have
gone through the old system, much like the Meiji restoration in Japan,
where Western culture swept through what was essentially medival Japan
of the Shogunate, there was still an essential charater to the culture
that remains to this day that was not changed a whole lot.

I see the collision of the Vilani and Solomani much the same way...some
solomani ways would have swept through the Ziru Sirka displacing the old
ways, and much would have swept _over_ it as water over a rock. It may
slowly wear the rock down, but it will take a very long time.

So...bearing this in mind...what _is_ the kind of societal mindset of
the 3I in this regard? Much of the canon material suffers heavily, as
various furriners ;-) are wont to point out, very biased towards \'Yanks
in Space\'. Given that the dominant culture of the 3I is heavily Vilani,
the basic societal outlook will be colored very much by entrenched
Vilani culture. You don\'t wipe out 5000 years of history with one series
of wars, fought mostly on the fronteirs until the very end, and a mere
1600 year long interregnum.

Here, however, I\'m woefully ignorant of canon as I don\'t have either the
Vilani Alien Module or the semi-mythical Vilani and Vargr DGP
publication.

Comments? Flames?

All four rule sets seem to be pretty clear on the matter. ["A character
becomes subject to the draft if 1) If he fails to pass every
enlistment roll, 2) if his enlistment roll is ever a 12 exactly, 3) he
volonteers for the draft."  Marc Miller\'s Traveller, p21]

The Gazelle class close escort write up from CT details that the ship

I apologize for the brevity of my reply.  I\'m on the road (in Washington
D.C. today), connecting with a PowerBook 540 (not to shabby, for a mac)  
over a PPP connection to work, telneting to my ISP, and back on PINE to

   While you can cite the *extremely* rare case where someone has fallen
through the cracks, *everyone* in the US that needs healthcare, gets it.
Part of the costs are picked up by the State (in the form of Medicare),
part by individuals, and part by private health care providers who pass on
their additional costs to insurance companies (who in turn pass the costs
on to their subscribers).

   In the US, no one goes hungry unless they do so out of choice.  There
are simply too many government and private charitable organizations for
anyone to have an excuse.

   College is not free, but 2 year community colleges provide low cost
education to anyone who graduates high school or obtains a GED (an
equivalent diploma earned usually through night classes).

   Sales taxes in the US run between 4.5 to 8 percent.  Salaries vary
generally according to cost of living, which tends to be higher on both
coasts.

   Comfort is relative.  While our Swedish friend here believes he lives
well, one wonders how much better (or maybe worse) he could live in the
American system.

   Which in the US is why many people don\'t trust the government to handle
everything.  They figure you are better off "paying as you go" for the most
part.

   In the *ideal* capitalist system, everyone is paid what they are worth,
businesses charge a fair price, and if they don\'t, their competitors do and
the bad companies go out of business.  It is an *economic* system, not
social system.  Capitalism can be tinkered with by government so that
resources are diverted to the government which allows government leaders to
perform social engineering, but nothing in Capitalism\'s structure takes
into account caring for the disadvantaged.

>>US isn\'t a horrible, evil, culturally imperialist robber baron capitalist
>>system run by warmongering lechers. ;-)

   Thank you for that ringing (?!) endorsement.

>I could argue, but I\'d better not. :-)

   There is no perfect way to live but some ways are better than others.
Political extremism (Fascism, Communism, religious dicatorship) is
generally agreed to be the least favorable way to go, while moderate
democracy (elected government leadership for which all citizens have a
right to vote) is the preferred.  

   In any case, the preferred economic system is the one that works best
for the people.  Note that is not necessarily the most popular.  People
being what they are, the most popular would no doubt involve the delivery
of a certain amount of gold bars to your door each week....

As an aside, I don\'t find comparisons of GNP terribly illuminating or
explaining much in Traveller -- but then I\'m more of a half-trained
anthropologist and not an economist, so that colors things.  What\'s more
helpful and personally interesting is to imagine and compare are a) wealth
distribution, b) social stratification, and c) standard of living.  Appending
indices of these to the UPP might be of more practical use to more refs and
players.  (With "standard of living", it\'s probably not necessary to point out
to this group that it\'s not really predictable from GNP/GDP, but that does
seem to be the popular assumption...)

No, no, no.  It\'s the _Aslan_ who are the Japanese.  Sheesh!  I thought
everyone knew that! ;)

Disclaimer: despite my name, I\'m not Japanese.  That being said, I\'ve
_personally_ seen considerable real cultural change in Japan, including in the
corporate workplace and in public attitudes towards politics, during just the
1980s and 1990s.  Also, many of the "enduring Japanese cultural traits" we
talk about abroad can convincingly attributed to relatively recent (post-
Meiji) political and historical forces.

Also, the Meiji Restoration is a poor comparison to the ZS/ROM transformation,
IMO.  If, say, a faction of the Vilani leadership had deposed the Ishimkarun
and reestablished traditional collegiate rule by the heads of the Bureaux, and
the Ziru Sirka then maintained political sovereignity through the ROM while
rapidly adopting "modernities" from the Terran Confederation, then I\'d agree
<G>.  Occupation Japan in this century might be a slightly better example...
or much better yet, I think, the effects/experience of the BEIC takeover of
India and subsequent British rule.

"Hey, what a great idea, having one person make decisions!  Those Solomani are
something else.  Don\'t you think so, Eneri?"

"You bet, Sharik.  I think it\'s a swell idea, putting just one person in

"Good thinking!  I\'ll go see if Marketing can come share their input about
that, and check if we can use the conference room."

I see the 3I\'s elite culture (i.e., that of interstellar society) as being
more of a syncretistic beast: heavily Vilani-influenced in its approach to
bureaucratic and organizational methods, but heavily Solomani-influenced in
its policy orientations.  

The imperial nobility I also see as a fundamentally Solomani feature (non-
consultative, absolutist rule) inspired by a poorly-understood Vilani "noble
class" (maybe more like a patron/client system than a feudal one, which is how
the Terrans understood it). 

Whether or not you believe Vilani die-off due to microbial infections to have
been extensive (<slam lid on low berth full of worms>) ISTR considerable
canonical reference to large numbers of Vilani assimilating to Solomani
culture after the IWs.  Likewise, there seems to have been extensive intrusion
of Solomani settlement everywhere through the old Z.S., including in Vland
sector; I think contact & diffusion in the ROM and again in the 3I must have
been quite extensive.  

While at first I would have expected that during the ROM the majority the
upper strata of Vilani society would be among those assimilating (along with
members of the lower strata whose position was particulary disrupted by early
social/economic reforms of the ROM), there\'s also canonical mention of the
fact that the directorates of the big Vilani-based megacorporations are
"conservatively Vilani" and generally instill those old Vilani cultural values
in their employees.  My suggestion, to have our argu and eat it too, would be
to posit a period of "Vilani revivalism" sometime early on during the 3I, when
elites in a position to do so had strong reason (political and/or emotional)
to "reclaim their lost heritage" or "acknowledge their ancient traditions" or
however it might be phrased.  Thus, the late 3I "conservative Vilani culture"
is actually a recovery or recreation of aspects of a high civilization that
pretty much _did_ dissappear as such.  That is, ISTU (in such a Traveller
universe), the "high culture" of Vland really did disappear during the ROM
(surviving in museums, libraries, and fragmentarily on this or that world),
while the "popular culture" of Vland lived on and fused variably with the new
Solomani cultures.  (For example, take SemoFetus\' post from last year about
"adushirga", Vilani charm bracelets.)

Someone more familiar with 3I history might be able to comment on this...

Anyone who\'s interested in Vilani civ. might want to look in on the TravLang
list; Stephen Johnson and I have recently been debating kinship structures and
family dynamics... and no, Stephen, I\'m not done with it yet <G>.  

Or maybe we should move the non-linguistic aspect of that discussion over
here?

    'from' => 'Douglas douglas@teleport.com',
    'body' => 'Has anyone given any thought to what exactly the software on ships does?
Or what should be available?  What I have is very much specific to my
campaign, but it seems that this is an area that could use some attention.

ANTI-HIJACK
Anti-Hijack is used to augment shipboard security against possible hostile
takeover.  In its basic form it provides:
- - Access control to critical portions of the ship.  A basic installation
would consist of a keypad on critical areas requiring a PIN for access.
More advanced installations could consist of a card reader, hand- or
finger- print scanner, retina scanner, DNA scanner, voice or ultimately
optical recognition.
- - Pattern matching - comparing crew/passenger actions against hijack 
profiles.
- - Air pressure and movement sensors to detect unauthorized access.

In its more advanced forms, the following upgrades are available:
- - Addition of lethal and non-lethal defense systems to the interior of the
ship.
- - Automated release of lethal and non-lethal defensive measures when
specific threshholds are exceeded.
- - Addition of sophisticated data, optical and audio sensors around the
interior of the ship to increase the level of data acquired by the
software.
- - Remote, mobile units to increase the detection/response level.

GENERATE
\'Generate\' allows the astrogator to set up and execute Hyperspacial
Transitions (Jumps).  Stellar and planetary data is culled from the
Library Data package and used for the calculations.  Making a Jump in any
but the most controlled conditions is considered very hazardous, and to
this end most astrogators prefer to reduce as many additional variables as
possible.

The most basic Generate package allows for a Jump calculation for a direct
course from point A to point B.  Upgrades in the software allow for:
- - Running Jump - jump to hyperspace with a realspace vector.  Normally an
astrogator will plot a jump with a system neutral vector.
- - Running Exit - emerge from hyperspace with a realspace vector.  Normally
an astrogator will plot a jump to result in a system neutral vector.
- - Jump offsets - permits the astrogator to plot a realspace course that
would result in a Jump to one point, when in reality the Jumpgrid
activates in such a way as to provide a J-Vector to another point.  (i.e.
he leaves Mos Eisley on a apparent course for Dantooine, but actually
jumps to Yavin.)  If a scanner is directed at the starship at the time of
jump, it is possible to eventually - it\'s a formidable task for a
astrogator even with computer assistance - be able to determine the course
laid in.
- - Emergence offsets - normally the course of the jump is calculated, if
possible, to cross the path of the destination planet.  This is to allow
the gravity well of the target planet to precipitate the emergence at
approximately the 100 diameter point.  It is possible, however, to program
the jump to emerge at any point the astrogator desires, within the
capability of the J-drive.  This is considered to be a very challenging
task for an astrogator because of variances in the individual ship\'s jump
fields, as well as the minor errors in the library database, as well as
any errors introduced by the astrogator or pilot in the course of plotting
and executing the jump.
- - Coordinated Jumps - used when more than one ship will be jumping, and it
is desirous for all the ships to appear in a coordinated fashion.  Again,
because of individual variances in the jump fields, detailed information
must be passed between all of the ships in the squadron for the \'Generate\'
programs to produce an effective jump-plan.  This can be a very dangerous
maneuver, and is generally only performed by military ships with a
task-optimized \'Generate\' program.

GUNNERY
\'Gunnery\' - provides an interface between the ships computer and weaponry
systems.
In its most basic form, it provides the following functions:
- - Records the ships sensor, weapon status and telemetry (if any) into the
ships log into the ships log.
- - Interfaces the gunners workstation to the ships sensors, and provides
fire control solutions.
- - Provides basic threat assessment and target prioritization.
- - Requires the gunner to make target assignment and authorize weapon
release.

Additonally, the following features can be obtained to upgrade the gunnery
suite:
- - Anti-Missile - a specific upgrade that provides specific threat
assessment and allows the computer to override the gunners target
designation.  Allows designated ships weapons to be fired without operator
intervention.
- - Return Fire - a specific upgrade that allows the ships computer to
activate designated ships weapons and return fire on hostile ships,
without operator intervention.
- - Gunner Interact - a specific upgrade that allows the gunner to override
the fire control solutions provided by the ships computer.  This allows
the gunners experience and intuition to enable him to increase the
probability of hitting his target and causing damage.
- - Predict - a series of specific upgrades that add increasingly
sophisticated algorithms to the Fire Control routines.  The end effect is
that the system is better able to predict the reactions of the opposing
ship and target the weapons accordingly.  IMTU, this is a progressive DM
(i.e. +0 the first combat round, +1 the second, +2 the third - to the
maximum Predict level available.), rather than a constant assigned.  A
spectacular failure in Gunnery will cause this DM to be reset to 0.

MANEUVER
\'Maneuver\' provides the Pilot with an interface with the ships computer,
allowing him to offload many routine maneuvers.  Even in its most basic
forms, is one of the more versatile software packages available to the
starship pilot.  (Note: many of these functions can and are performed by 
qualified pilots.  These functions merely relieve some of the standard
tasks a pilot performs to allow him to concentrate on other functions he 
may have to perform.)  It has the following functions:
- - \'Establish Orbit\' - moves you from a point in space to a designated
planet and establishes a Imperial Standard orbit.  Also used to return to
a Standard Imperial orbit from either a downport or highport.
- - \'Land\' - takes you from an Imperial Standard orbit to land at the
designated spaceport (requires either active sensors or a direct
communications link with an ATC computer.)  Note - local gravity must be
less than the rated output of your M-Drive (the software does not allow
for overdriving the M-drive.)  This function is not designed for \'Wild\'
(non-spaceport) landings, although it will take a ship down to a \'soft\'
(i.e. water) landing quite well.
- - \'Dock\' - computes and executes the maneuvers necessary to dock with a
designated space platform or craft (requires either active sensors or a
direct communications link with an ATC computer.)
- - \'Go There\'  - the pilot picks a point or planet from the system display,
and the software computes and executes the necessary maneuvers to reach
those coordinates.  When the \'Generate\' package is running, the Maneuver
series integrates the resulting calculation into the \'Go There\' function
and executes it.

There are also the following advanced features, available as add-ons that
can be purchased separately:
- - Advanced Landing - this is a specific upgrade to the Maneuver package
that allows the computer to interface with the ships sensors and any
stored data regarding terrain to ealuate, select and perform a \'wild\'
landing (outside of a starport.)  Requires active radar/ladar in order to
be successful.
- - \'Evade\' - A specific series of upgrades to the software package.  Evade
permits the pilot to override specific safety functions in the \'Maneuver\'
software (such as closest permissible approach, drive ratings, max
atmospheric speed, hull stress warnings, etc...)

I generally provide \'basic\' packages to the players - if they want access
to more advanced features they need to either \'upgrade\' or write
additional features into their own software.

Being one of "them Yanks", my point of view is naturally suspect; however,

I figure that it was the Vilani cultural mindset among the masses, whether
Vilani-descended or not, and the resulting tendency to stay at home and do
what was expected of one, that led to the creation of a class of
"Travellers".  It became the role of these social misfits to undertake all
the dangerous, unpredictable, and individualistic tasks on the margins that
keep an interstellar society running smoothly, so that the rest of society
could get on with the really important work.  Occassionally, one of these
"adventurers" makes a pile of money - then society pushes them off to the
margin again, this time with the "nobles" and other trouble-makers.  Most
of these "Travellers" don\'t survive long enough to breed, however (show of
hands:  how many of your characters, regardless of their ages, have *ever*
been married or had children? PE characters don\'t count), so in the long
run they are not a problem.

I also rather like Frederick Jackson Turner, so what can you say?

What kind of family life do Traveller characters typically have?  Take, for
instance, the difference between a subsidized merchant and a free trader.
The reaction I usually get to the merchant is, "What, be tied down to a
specified route?  Where\'s the adventure in that?"  But consider:  the
merchant can have a home and a family on one of the worlds on his route,
and still expect to see them once in a while.  Most free traders I know
leave their notional "homeworlds", never to return.  Does everyone wait
into their 50\'s (anagathics or no) to retire and have a family?

The military, up until very late this century, has been a single man\'s
game.  Only senior officers ("Lieutenants may not marry, captains may
marry,...") and *very* senior NCO\'s were allowed to have families.
Presumably, the Imperial armed forces work on this basis, but what if you
character is one of those senior officers?  "...majors should marry,
colonels must marry."

This becomes even more interesting for GURPS Traveller campaigns.  GURPS
character generation uses the concept of "disadvantages", including
Dependents.  Now, for essentially the first time, we have to ask, "What
happens when Free Trader Captain Nicole Fearless brings along her husband
the artist and the kids?"

Food for thought, I hope.

in my last traveller game we had as a ship a Beowulf-class free trader (the

daughters (both of who where PCs).  her husband was dead and both of her
daughters wanted to follow moms footsteps, so to speak.  

now Kat\'s home world was a very interesting world where marriage was more
along the lines of three women to one man kind of thing due to the fact the
population was seven females to every male.  so lot\'s of the planets female
population would leave the planet looking for a suitable husband material and
bring them back (plus there was the HUGE blackmarket where unmarried males
where brought in as "labour" only to get their visa\'s and passports
confiscated by their bosses and used as "Indentured Husbands"- now this is a
really cool adventure if any of you want the info on it)....

any how, Kat\'s two daughters spent most of their time as the ships techs,
ships steward, and what ever else they where needed for at any given time (no,
not that- well, unless they where in the mood and you where cute)...  

so a free merchant could actually take their families with them on their ship
if they make the room. so one passenger stateroom gets turned into your family
apartment big deal, think of all the plot hooks and adventure ideas your GM
and think up that deals with your family!!! (uh oh.. i see a robot screaming
"Danger Will Robinson! Danger!" runing around with lights flashing on this
note...  oh well its a cool effect).

as for other PC types, the Noble has the money and resources (and possibly the
lands \'Back Home\' to keep up a nice house with the picket fence, the
chambermaids in the skimpy outfits, the perfect bodysculpted wife (who is
spending your adventure moeny and sleeping with the pool boy, the
chambermaids, the postman, ect), the kids, hte pets, ect...  

the military in my setting also have what is refered to as family ships.  they
are huge (larger than even the largest colony ships) and used to transport
military personnel families.  of course these ships travel in packs (or Home
Fleets) along with resort ships, agriculture ships, prison ships, ect. with
some escort vessels as well...   this allows military families to stay close
together. but in times of war, these ships are ported in civilian ports and
sit out the duration of the war. 

other careers can have families as well, you just have to be inventive with
them... 

hope that gives you some ideas for some games...

IMTU, every anagathic found so far causes sterility as a side-effect.

People are used to it, they think of it as one of the prices one pays
for immortality. The social balancing effect is also beneficial - Fred
may live 1000 years, but he won\'t have 1000 kids. "Immortals" become
disconnected from society a bit, what with not being able to have
children and all, but that disconnection is also seen as a price of
immortality. Without these perceived prices, those who could not
afford immortality would eventually resent and perhaps even destroy
those who could.

IMTU there isn\'t even any (public) research going on to find out why
anagathics cause sterility or how sterility can be prevented.

Other possible side-effects of Anagathics IMTU:

1. Interference with normal development. Not usually a problem with
adults, but children should never be exposed to anagathics. The effects
would be unpredictable at best. The Troglodyte lost colony mentioned
in the Leviathan adventure had some racial oddities IMTU caused by 
exposure of the young to low levels of natural anagathics in their 
environment.

2. Changes in physical appearance. Many users of anagathics will
experience loss of hair color (or hair), changes in complexion, etc.
Many of these are related to the aging process - the user will take on
some appearances of aging, often faster than they would have without
the drug, while otherwise retaining youthful capabilities. These
changes in appearance serve to indicate (to most people) that the
person in question is a user of anagathics, though many can be
disguised. The mix of youthful appearance and aged appearance on
the same individual is quite disconcerting to many people - imagine
realizing that the twenty-something you\'re talking to has ancient 
wrinkles around their eyes, like their smooth cheeks were a mask.

3. Health risks. Some people\'s bodies develop a tolerance for
whatever anagathic the person is using, forcing them to try a different
variety - and they may suffer some unusual aging between losing
the orginal anagathic effect and building up a new one.
Some people develop allergies or other environmental sensitivities,
probably because their body systems are made abnormal by the drug.
Some medical procedures may become more complex as well,
perhaps leading to a medical specialty in treating "Immortals".

4. Psychological risks. Memory overload? Gradual erosion over
centuries of one\'s sense of self? Resistance of brain tissue to
anagathic effects? Some unnoticed psychological effect of the
anagathic drugs themselves?
Regardless of the reason, many long-term anagathics users show
eccentric behaviour, and they have a sligthly higher incidence of
mental disorders. 



Just some concepts used IMTU, on the one or two times we
mentioned anagathics at all...dying of old age was seldom a problem
players worried about IMTU...  <g>

  Given the historical record it appears that the original posters\'
assertion is factually correct. An exception would require the definition
of most of the post-colonial Latin American republics as being non-valid
for the discussion of democracies, but such should be stated clearly.

  Actually, even then it might be tricky, as the number of democratic
regimes to fall (at least for any length of time) to external force
is very small (OC, so is the number of non-democratic...). OTOH, non-
democratic regimes are notoriously harder to remove from power by
internal efforts without the participation of the military, which is
of course almost always involved with said authoritarian regime, which
should tell us something right there.

  FWIW, fron the POV of many of its\' members, isn\'t the 3I a military state?

  (Once upon a time a Vietnamese immigrant [father left VN for health
reasons, having been an ARVN officer] asked me whether I felt guilty
about the treatment of NorAm aboriginals by the Canadian gov\'t. He was
somewhat surprised when I gave a qualified yes followed by an inquiry
as to the highwater mark of the medieval Vietnamese Empire and the
extent to which other Indochinese peoples had been subjugated by those
conquests).

  As something of a social conservative (no Comrades, not the purge!) I
tend to agree; luckily the 3I restricts itself to providing the public
good of security, both internal and external (maintaining command
channels and enforcing their mandate not being counted as separate
responsibilities - i.e., the X-boats & IISS are at least nominally
there to serve the Empires\' needs, and not because they would be neat
services for its\' inhabitants)

  To be fair, all of the Western gov\'ts (Nazi Germany not being included
in the political West in this case, not surprisingly) dropped the ball
pretty badly on that one, at least initially.

  Re the part about distrusting the central gov\'t: you can certainly
connect that to the Vilani cultural region going turtle during the
Rebellion.

  FWIW, how well would intact Vilani social groups (with a drastically
curtailed economy, admittedly) have recovered from Virus*? I don\'t recall
having seen anything on the subject.

Once an invading force has dealt with SDBs, etc. planetary defences must
be broached.COACC looks after everything closer than geosynchronous
orbit, or thereabouts. Besides aerospace craft, COACC also runs
antispacecraft defenses that are ground-based. At sufficiently high tech
levels, buried (deep) meson guns are used because they\'re harder to find
and destroy and do a lot of damage....
In the current incarnation of Fire, Fusion and Steel, deep meson sites
are spherical gun carriages lined with contragrav modules to permit the
gun to point in the required direction, with power and control
facilities in an adjacent cavern, linked to surface sensors.
Roughly, each metre of meson tunnel (gun) length = 1000km of range.
The gun carriage\'s diameter is 20% longer than the meson gun.
You need an accumulator bank to quickly charge the gun, and a power
plant to run the accumulator and the carriage.
There are some sample designs on trav-tech@qrc.com - retrieve one of the
lists (v1.n209 or thereabouts).

There could be a benefit in that your subordinate craft are protected by
the mother ship\'s armour. Externally mounted space craft are easier to
launch than hangar based ones (although the fastest way to get ride of
your ships is through launch tubes, if space permits).Essentially, it\'s
up to the architect.
Separate area has been allocated to the jump grid (which I assume to be
a fine tracery running all over the hull, so it\'s not easy to defend,
but also difficult to significantly damage).

Cultural bias. The jump field extends over externally mounted ships, so

The Tigress dreadnaught is a huge (500000 displacement ton) ship, and
hugely expensive (453389.2 MCr).
Cost is the primary constraint. The ease of detecting such large ships
is another important factor to consider. Has someone looked at
risk/benefit (investment vs. survival) for vessels of this size ?
Terraforming or colony ships might get bigger, but they\'re virtually
custom vessels.
A billion displacement ton ship? - that\'s a sphere just under three
kilometres in diameter.  The city-wreckers from \'Independence Day\'
(yecch) may be about the right size.
Psychologically intimidating, at least.
But then again, it would be cheaper to fake it eg. Cordwainer Smith\'s
"Golden the Ship Was-Oh ! Oh ! Oh !"

It\'s easy to second guess the people on the ground at the time. Why should the
US have expended one more US or US Allied life to save a Japanese life? Mr.
Rydholm can be as pacifistic as he wants, but *he* wasn\'t one of the PBI (and
Marines!) who were *going* to be casualties in Downfall. *ANYTHING* that saved
allied lives was justified. Sod the Japs ... and their continual whining about
how unfair it all was. Berry is right, *they* chose to go to war, shaft the
consequences of the actions needed to end it home to *them*.

Nope!

Iron and steel don\'t get appreciably plastic until noticeably *above*
"dull red" heat. Which is above the melting point of lead and near the
melting point of aluminum. I pick those metals because we had all three
being worked with the same forge. Casting for lead and aluminum, and
forging for iron and steel.

Now you know why the DIs emphasize keeping your rifle (*not* "gun"!)
clean! 

Our best guess as to *how* that grit got there is that the stripper
clip we loaded the rifle from had been in my friend\'s pocket *without*
the paper wrapping they come in. And it picked up the grit from there. 

I\'m making it a point to *not* unwrap the strippers until use!

Alas, the cheap SKS ammo is steel cratridges, so it\'s not reloadable.
We still pick the casing up to clean the area, but that\'s just being
good woodsmen. (I also pick up the 22 brass everybody leaves laying
around, because when we get enough we can use it to cast ornaments out
of).

Our problem was that the round *wouldn\'t* eject. Of course, it turned
out to be an empty casing, but still...

BTW, I\'m reminded of a tale I heard once upon a time. It\'s a nasty that
could be used by or against players.

Seems a certain government agency that shall remain nameless was able
to insinuate someone into an operation smuggling arms and ammo to a
"non-approved" geurilla group.

As the story goes, their man swapped a few cases of ammo for "doctored"
cases. These had a few "special" rounds scattered thru them. 

The special rounds looked the same and weighed the same. But they
contained an explosive charge rather than normal gun powder. Pull the
trigger with one of these in the chamber and the gun *literally* "blows
up in your face".

A similar bit of nastiness was replacing the occasional coil of delay
fusing with a coil of detcord doctored to *look* like delay fuse. Delay
fuse burns at so many inches per minute (or some such). Detcord
"burns" (actually detonates) at a few thousand feet per second.

So our happy little bomb maker measures the fuse to give a X minute
delay, and lights it. He might even have time to *think* "Oh sh!!" he
won\'t have time to say it.

Well, as I recall, Sweden had to convene an emergency session of their
law making body when it was discovered that the tax laws they\'d passed
during the last session could result in a tax rate of 102% for certain
persons! 

This *was* 10-15 years back, but still....

The problem with such high tax rates is that above a certain point is
starts to look like it\'s not worth the effort to earn more as you\'d
only lose most of it to taxes. 

In Britain, this resulted in a *lot* of people opting to move elsewhere
to avoid the taxes (Arthur C. Clarke being one of the more famous
cases). 

I don\'t know what it\'s done in Sweden, but it *is* a possibility to be
considered. "Brain Drain" as the Brits called it can really hurt a
country.

Celsius and Centigrade are different names for the same scale. And it
runs from -273.15 (0 Kelvin) on up. 

Kelvin uses the same size degree (1.8 Fahrenheit degrees) and starts at
absolute zero.

Well my legal training was over 15 years ago and I didn\'t pursue it as a
career and NZ is still bound by precident from a superior court (at least it was 
15 years ago :*>). I guess its another case of being divided by our common 
language (kind of like how the US got to keep attornies while the rest of us got 
lumped with solicitors)

I choose deliberatly to heavily accentuate the inquistorial aspects, it just fits 
better with my image of the Imperium. They are more interested establishing 
the "truth" in a lot of matters (refer to the powers I gave the courts to exclude 
witnesses, evidence and lines of questioning).

[WARNING: mindless constitutional debate follows]

It becomes important in 1116 :*> Its covered in Articles II and III. Article II 
states that "the powers of the Imperium shall be vested in the Emperor".
Article III states that the Moot "shall provide their advice and council to the 
Emperor prior to any legislation or action by the Emperor" and it also gives
the Moot two other powers: "to dissolve the Imperium" and to "disqualify an 
Imperial Heir"

From this I\'d say the power of law derives from the Imperium and that the Moot
represents the Imperium to the Emperor. However this is all theoretical. In
practice of course the Emperor is supreme by the authority of the Imperial
fleet. The "Right of Assassination" is an interesting point here; it gives the
Moot the right to remove an Emperor (putting the Moot above the Emperor).

Lets see, in NZ a gentle nod is the appropriate acknowledgement and

I like the more "feudal" feel of calling the courts by their noble titles. helps to 
remind players of the true nature of the system.

I worked on NZ\'s levels as a model. We have 5 tiers (with a 6th about to be
introduced). Most cases are heard at the 2nd tier, with appeals to the 3rd. 
Serious cases are heard at the 3rd. Appeal from 3rd to 4th to 5th is only by
leave (though a case heard first at 3 would almost always be granted leave).

I put it in to allow the prosecution to appeal a not guilty verdict without
creating double jeapardy. Convictions and sentancing can be appealed
much as our current legal system (with the inherant risks that involves, as
you detailed).

Most definitely. It would be exceptional for any noble to reach into a court. It 
most certainly would be noticed in *all* sorts of places :*>

I like it give PC\'s an incentive to perform. Also if the Duke can trump up some 
"nice" charges in the first place..... (my modification in only allowing the court 
itself to call and question witnesses is intended to allow the Empire to stack 
the deck if neccessary). Just I wouldn\'t have the Duke commute or reverse a 
sentance. I\'d have the good Duke suspend it. Much easier to explain to your 
superiors if neccessary. Then if the character performs really well the Duke can 
exercise the perogative of mercy and issue a pardon.

Machinegun barrels are swapped at about 500 degrees Celsius, which is just
starting to glow in darkness. At this point the barrel wear rate is
starting to increase rapidly, but deformation is still some way off.

And one shouldn\'t forget that the Japanese army in Manchuria kept on until

I suspect that sooner or later some of the propellant gas would remain in
the barrel beteen firings, with disasterous results for the barrel. However
the firer would probably be OK as the barrel would probably only slplit,
not shatter.

It was _Guns & Ammo_, probably about ten years ago. I can\'t do better than

This gets messy. Any decently populated planet is going to have to be
*forced* to surrender. A fleet can\'t carry enough people to take over
against any sort of determined resistance. After all, if the population
is a *mere* billion people, how many troops does it take to keep them
in line. A million troops would be hard to transport, and give you
*one* soldier per *thousand* people. So you have to wear them down
somehow.

It\'s possible to just blast the planetary surface (and any subsurface
installations you can detect) into rubble from orbit. But one generally
attack a planet with the intention of *taking over*. If you blast it to
rubble, you\'d be better of starting fresh on an uncolonized planet!

So the various planetary defense are to cut downm on the amount of
surface bombarment from orbit and try to make landing troops as
difficult as possible.

The original designs *didn\'t* have the riders carried inside. I don\'t
know about more recent ones.

And even if you go along with the surface grid idea, it\'s possible to
have a grid installed on the riders, and just have it connect to the
"carrier"\'s grid thru the grapples.

Because the designer felt like it?

Well, you run into problems getting rid of waste heat on really big
ships. Not enough surface area for the volume.

From: Andrew Moffatt-Vallance <a.vallance@netaccess.co.nz>
Subject: An open letter regarding miitary service, pacifism, etc.

>Andrew etc.


Andrew the point here is out of context.  In both cases these people stood
up for what they believed in and DIDN\'T run and hide in a cave or something.
Don\'t think though that I don\'t respect Jens\' personal beliefs, I
volunteered to defend his right to believe any way he wants.  Sweden is
after all "affiliated" with NATO, I just don\'t want him or anyone else
putting me down for my beliefs.  What\'s the old saying, "don\'t look down on
me until you\'ve walked a mile in my shoes."  No one knows , not even me, why
I stayed in the military for 20 years or why anyone else would stay in for
that matter.

It has been interesting reading so far about a lot of personal feelings and
beliefs from a whole lot of people.  The reason its so interesting to me is
the fact that its happening on the TML.  This is a place where a good 98% of
careers start in the military.  I didn\'t say 98% of the occupations
available, I said 98% of the occupations started.  For those figures check
your own game and poll how many of your players are NON-Military or military
affiliated (Scouts) as a beginning career.  Add this to the fact that
everyone wants their ship armed so that it might defend itself and you come
to the conclusion that SOME people aren\'t being honest with themselves.  I
would almost bet that 99.99999% (1 in a 1,000,000 haven\'t) of all Traveller
players have participated in combat of some kind or other so at least some
where at the sub-conscious level all players believe that there are a hell
of a lot things worth dying for.  They just don\'t want to admit it because
the image that they project to their peers and the rest of the world would
be tarnished.  The mind set is a little skewed to the right of center to
begin with in Traveller, after all wasn\'t it originally written by another
war mongering American.  Those of us who play the game know this is true,
haven\'t YOU participated in combat of some form?

Does anyone else find this as ironic as me?  Actually, I would be very
interested in finding out the backgrounds of several "player characters"
based on some of the fan/hate mail I received for posting my views.  BTW, to
those of you who responded positively, THANK YOU!  For those of you who
responded negatively, THANK YOU!  My response to all of the mail I received
is as follows:

I tend to believe that ALL people are due the right to live and die anyway
they want to as long as it doesn\'t interfere with the majority of the rest
of the world or is morally wrong. (No I really don\'t want to get into morale
beliefs, please don\'t over extend the definition of the word or the way it
was intended to be used here.)  In that way I have mellowed dramatically
over the last 30 years or so.  When I first entered the armed forces I was
intent on wiping out those stinking commy bastards with what ever it took.
As the years went by and I learned more and more about PEOPLE and other
countries I started to have a lot of doubts about a lot of "American" ideas.
A whole bunch were good and solid but some where pure hogwash and I was able
to slowly distill the good from the bad on my on.  I\'ve been reading a lot
of history and some sociology books and I am much more liberal in my views
today than I was in 1969 (once again, I\'m still skewed toward "American"
interpretations on a number of things, sorry, the nature of the beast).

All I can say to the list is, don\'t be so naive as to believe that the way
you think is the only RIGHT way.  Its not!!!!  Jens is a communist,
so....Communism in its purist form is a great IDEA.  Socialism in concept
ain\'t that bad either.  I personally don\'t believe that they will work
because you\'re still stuck with humanity (read that to be greed, avarice,
envy, ignorance, arrogance, egotistic, etc.) trying to carry them out.
America is somewhere in between a socialistic and, and, and, hell I\'m not
even sure any more.  I looked up the definition of Democracy as published in
an English dictionary in the 1750\'s and found it to be slightly different
from our current "implementation".  That makes me wonder if we are following
the tracks laid by our founding fathers as they understood it and wanted it
for the people of the USA...This leads me to say, "I neither condone nor
condemn MOST actions that occurred or will occur by ANY country in the
history of the planet."  That leaves a big open playing field for
interpretation and I\'m not willing to discuss specifics as related to ANY
country, mine or yours.  Life goes on, the world still turns, and we will
only live for x number of years.  What impact I will have on this planet
will be so negligible it might as well be ZERO.  Same goes for almost
everyone here, so calm your egos down.


Bottom line, I\'m sorry for my comments to Anders Backman that seem to have
gotten this started.  I can\'t take back my opinions as stated in the
original message and I\'m not really sure that I want to BUT, I am sorry for
the heated discussion that it seems to have started.  No that wasn\'t an
apology to Anders, rather an apology to the TML.  No amount of ranting or
raving is going to change anything here, it won\'t happen until everyone
searches their own hearts and tries to get answers based on their own
convictions.  In any case, you have to be first and foremost HONEST WITH
YOURSELF about what YOU truly believe.  Any further discussions on this
directed toward me please use private mail.  I won\'t promise I will reply
but I will at least read your opinions and hopefully they will further
mellow me in my "wisdom gaining years".

  IIRC, that was against the Communist/leftist nationalist insurgents in

It did?

My grandfather\'s brother has vivid memories of Japanese soldiers
returning to Japan after the surrender by the tens of thousands or more,
most of them from Manchuria.  His small unit was one of those accepting
their surrender. It made him very uncomfortable, these hordes of troops
marching off the transports, veterans who had never been defeated
in battle, outnumbering the American occupation force in the whole
port city. The Japanese stacked their rifles and went home without
incident, much to my great-uncle Floyd\'s relief.

The only Russian involvement in the Pacific theater (IIRC) was a
declaration of war just days before the Japanese surrender so the
Soviets could grab some undefended islands north of Japan.


ObTrav: Has the 3i\'s opinion on what to do with troops who retire
(or get invalided out, or discharged, or whatever) been spelled out?
Say you sign on in Core and your tour is up at the Regina navy base?

Do they just hand you a stack of Middle (or even Low) passages
with your retirement check? Maybe the ones you end up with from
the "Benefits" table represent tickets you had left after you found
your way home, or ones you had left when you decided that "home"
didn\'t mean that much to you any more.

Or do you spend the next few years hanging around military bases
as an "Ex", hitching rides whenever you can find a ship going in 
the general direction of home? (Admin and Bribery skills might be
useful here).

Does the Military reserve some space on regular transport runs for
taking people home? Space that is usually sufficient, but sometimes
(say at the end of the 5th Frontier War) gets overwhelmed by a sudden
surge in people released from the military?

I recall a Heinlein story where a spacer claimed a right to a ride home.
I\'m imagining a retirement benefit, an ID card or token with your
designated homeworld on it. Present it to any naval transport heading
towards your homeworld, and (space permitting) they\'ll give you a bunk.
You\'re supposed to turn it over to a Navy (or Army, or whatever) 
representative when you get home, but I can imagine some retirees
keeping it as a memento (or to scam some free rides with later).

"The Long Way Home" type scenarios are classic themes.

Interesting.  I find this reminiscent of Banks\' Culture, with the Contact
service and particularly Special Circumstances serving to absorb and
occupy all the misfits.  In the Culture, of course, this is so the rest of
society can get on with hedonism and political maneuvering. :)

Hordes of local folk armed to the teeth.  On any habitle planet you are
going to have to pacify the population, and that\'s a tall order (just ask
the German Army of WW2.)  On non-habitle worlds, control of the
life-support machinary will ensure control.

A deep meson site is a very large meson cannon buried deep inside the
planet\'s crust.  Since mesons ignore matter when they fire, this is a very
effective planetary defence scheme.. your gun is buried a mile or two (or
seven, or fifteen) under the ground, and is virtually undetectable.

The weak point is the power supply, and the need for a sensor array to
target enemy vessels in orbit.

FFS2 had rules for building these monsters.

We\'ve built them though!  Someone posted the "City" class mega=frieghter a
few months back.. about a billion tons, crew in the low 10,000s.. and the
design worked!  We even came up with a use for the bloody things.  I\'ve
done a design for a billion-ton Army Transport..  the *entire* Army (close
to 100,000 troops plus equipment) in a single ship.

158 306 307  -

Note: these are the active fleets assigned to the subsectors, on the eve of
the rebellion. The book mentions that there are reserve numbered fleets in
each subsector, but does not list them. In addition there is the named fleet
for the sector; in this case I have to asume that it is named The Empty
Quarter Fleet as again the book does not list them. The book implies that
sectors with smaller amounts of fleets (like this one) use the named fleet as
merely an administrative echelon of command, and not an operational level.

As for regiments; the Rebellion Source Book does not list them. It gives an
organizational outline (ex. what types of troops-Infantry, etc.), and a
generation table that gives numbers of Battalions on a world. In my opinion,
the Marines would have one maneuver unit per subsector fleet (the size of the
unit would depend on the size of the reserve and active fleet in each
subsector- ie. how many Squadrons per fleet, and if there are dedicated
transports for the Marines, or if they are converged ship\'s troops). I have no
idea how to organize the active Imperial Army troops, except maybe one Corps
per subsector. This is based on an assumption that an AssaultRon is in each
subsector Fleet, and each AssaultRon can lift an Army Corps.

Hope this helps...

I assumed that this is a device to limit the number of characters needed
to be rolled to start a game.

Capitalism, is not there to provide for social responsibilities...  It is
the job of the people...  It is not the job of government (their job is to
keep people from shooting at you while others do it...)...  Nor is it the
job of business (their job is to make money...)...

The whole thing of it is, is that people do for other people...  Not
governments or businesses...

liked the Maneuver write-up, as this filled a nice gap in my own 
thoughts about the capabilities of the program.

The improved generate program to allow co-ordinated jumps 
sounded a litlle "hand-wavey" at first, but now I have thought 
through the idea, I like it.

IMTU subsidised merchants (like the one in The Traveller 
Adventure) are not sold with a Generate program. Instead they use 
pre-generated tapes (I vaguely recall that these are canon) that let 
you jump for A to B.  Tapes are only valid for a relatively narrow time 
range (two days) due to the movement of planets, but are available from 
the local "Office of Subsidised Traders" (OST) for 100 Cr a time.  Such 
offices exist on all worlds of a subsidised route.  Often, the OST is 
one of the many small jobs the local portmaster has, which I usually 
compare to the the film "Local Hero".  In that film, one man ran the 
local post office/hotel/fishing rod hire/etc because there was too 
little trade to justify a full-time person for each job ... my D and E 
starports are often like that!

Because ships come with limited (or no) version of each program, the 
ability to write your own programs was more important IMTU.  With 
Douglas\' rules I can easily extend the system to cope with (say) 
generate-5 (the Imperial Data package definition of the version that 
supports co-ordinated jumps) - you just need someone with Computer-6 
and Nav-6 to write it, plus a six months (1000 sophont-hours + 30% for 
each additional sophont needed to get the combined skills).  This gives 
players something to do during jump:

Example 1: "I\'m working on the new anti-hijaak program, to tie it into 
those new motion sensors we got cheap from Ripley.  I reckon I can use 
them to track everyone\'s location and use that as a second-tier 
authenication process in case some smart alec tries to reproduce the 
captain\'s retinal pattern again."

Example 2: "I\'ll put together an IDP 9001 documentation package and 
submit Jack\'s new Generate-4 program for verification testing on 
Glisten so that I can sell it.  No, I\'m not telling Jack - besides I\'m 
paying the verification fee <wicked smile>."


There is something strangly satisfying in exchanging a knowing 
look with the Ref and being told "you made a good roll there - add 100 
hours towards the completion of your latest project".  The gradual 
build up towards a final goal (be it study to gain a new skill level, 
writing programs or working out in the gym) is similar to those 
experience point awards that make Dungeons & Dragons fun for 
"competitive" role-players (i.e. most players, in my experience).  I 
prefer this form of continual assessment to the "make a roll - no you 
failed to achieve anything in the last six months".  I have even 
this type of character development for absent players - "Scotty is 
working feverishly to complete his latest program and refuses to come 
out on some fool expidition in a cramped ATV".  The extra dose of 
experience points (hours) towards completion of a pet project can be 
significant compensation for missing out on an evening\'s role-playing 
.. and it always seems to provide ample justification for Scotty 
turning up to save the day when the party cock-up in grand style.

Of course - with two reminders:

1. You\'re not breeding with your political-alliance spouse if she\'s
an immortal as well. Anagathics + female pregnancy hormones
do not mix, at least not in any way that will create a survivable
womb environment.

2. Immortals don\'t have kids. This is a cultural view that just happens
to match the usual state of reality. If you\'re the supreme leader and
can get away with anything then fine, but it\'s often dangerous to go
against your people\'s cultural biases.
Immortals don\'t have children or heirs. They are the embodiment of
whatever dynasty they wished to found, it lives and dies with them.

Above is IMTU, of course - YTUMV.

Imprecise and misleading language.  All Japanese war criminals who hadn\'t been
captured by the Soviets and Brits were in the hands of the US at the end of
the war.  The US eventually _chose_ not to prosecute many of them, and in fact
tried to help many of them get back into politics and business.  There was
this Cold War thing starting up, y\'see, and the US felt that some chastened
and "probably reformed" fascists were better allies than the political parties
and factions that would have been left surviving if a genuine war-crimes sweep
had been made.  

The opposition parties in Japan at the time of surrender and onwards would
have been _DELIGHTED_ to see the war criminals prosecuted -- but, alas, those
people were mostly socialists and feminists and cosmopolitan intellectuals and
other subversive types, and so had to be kept out of power in order to protect
the security of the Free World.  So it goes...

>Let us not forget the Rape of Manchuria...

I assume you mean the Rape of Nanjing?  Manchuria was _prosperous_ during
Japanese occupation, and underwent considerable increases in population,
capital investment, and agricultural and industrial production.  Still no
picnic, but a far better place to be than most of the rest of East Asia in the
\'30s and early \'40s.  I\'ve met older Chinese workers who fled _into_ Manchuria
in the late \'30s to get away from the Guomindang government and to live in
relative security and affluence.  It\'s not a real acceptable piece of recent
history in the PRC, but it seems to be widely known to be true by the folks
who live(d) there.  

The Soviets disassembled quite a few choice factories and whatnot and hauled
them over the border; then the civil war in China expanded into the Northeast
and damaged the infrastructure -- and the inhabitants -- quite a bit, clear
into 1949.

As Walter Smith has pointed out in another post, the Japanese army in
Manchuria was pretty sizable and still relatively intact at surrender.
However, he also wrote:

>The only Russian involvement in the Pacific theater (IIRC) was a
>declaration of war just days before the Japanese surrender so the
>Soviets could grab some undefended islands north of Japan.

Manchuria too; fought a couple minorish actions and interned all the Japanese
soldiers and civilians they could lay hands on.  Some weren\'t repatriated
until the late \'50s.  

Also, the islands in question weren\'t technically north _of_ Japan; they
_were_ northern Japan, politically speaking.  IIRC, southern Sakhalin
(Karafuto) was administratively part of the home islands since the late 1910s,
and had a population of several hundred thousand Japanese civilians.  That\'s
why the territorial dispute between Japan and the USSR/Russia is so quaint-
sounding to Western newscasters, who are under the impression they\'re just
"strategically located barren islands".  Besides having heaps of oil and coal
on Sakhalin, the place was _home_ to large numbers of Japanese.  It generates
the same sort of knee-jerk patriotism as handing Alaska back to the Russians
and deporting all US citizens would generate in the US <G>

Phillip McGregor suggested:

> Sod the Japs ... and their continual whining

FWIW, I can\'t recall _ever_ running into Japs who whined, even intermittently,
about the two nuclear bombs.  Not to say that there isn\'t an anti-nuke
movement in Japan with a particular historical chip on the shoulder, but in my
experience living there it wasn\'t any more significant than similar movements
in the US.  I do remember watching TV once and seeing news coverage about some
non-approved memorial service in Hiroshima; NHK definitely implied the anti-
nuke grassrooters were nuts from the fringe.  But then I lived in Tokyo...

    'body' => 'There has been considerable effort expended by several contributors to this
list, aimed at determining the cost effectiveness and viability of ships
with jump numbers above Jump-1.  I\'ve been doing some reading in
here-and-now merchant marine shipping.  One point that stuck out is the
facility with which these ships trade fuel-on-board for cargo deadweight
capacity and vice versa, depending on the requirements of their route.
Similarly, the large class of Ore/Bulk/Oil (OBO) carriers use cargo spaces
that can, with a certain amount of cleaning, be used for anything from
grain to crude oil to industrial ores.

I looked into the ship construction rules in CT, FF&S, and GURPS Vehicles
(2d Ed), and I can see no reason why fuel tanks (especially for H2) can\'t
be fitted with hatches and used as auxiliary cargo holds.  Granted, fuel
tanks are more expensive than cargo holds (which generally cost nothing, in
fact), and there is some wasted space, ranging from 5% in FF&S (per
collapsible tanks) to 10% in VE2 (0.15ft^3/gal).  Also granted that such
spaces might be extremely awkward, especially on small, streamlined ships -
such as PC\'s are wont to have, and at which the current trade and commerce
system is aimed.  A large, unstreamlined, Jump-3 merchantman making a
series of Jump-1 or Jump-2 legs (where 10-20% of the ship\'s tonnage is
currently going to waste), might realize some benefit from this approach,
however.

The question I put to the list, particularly those who have done the
extensive cost analyses, is this:  how would converting the unused portion
of a route merchant\'s fuel tankage to cargo on short legs (less than
maximum jump rating) affect the cost of operating those high jump ships? 

- ----

A Sidebar on Procedure:

Converting from fuel tankage to cargo hold:  Pump as much remaining fuel as
possible into another tank.  Either vent the remainder to vacuum (in
orbit), *slowly* vent in controlled amounts of outside air and combust the
residue into water vapor (oxygen atmosphere), or vent it directly into a
reducing atmosphere.

Converting from aux cargo hold back to fuel tankage:  Remove all solid
waste (dunnage, scrap, residual cargo, etc.).  Steam-clean all inside
surfaces.  Vent remaining atmosphere to vacuum (in orbit) or pump out into
ship\'s life support system (on surface).  Fill tank with H2 and check
purity.  If necessary, recirculate fuel through fuel purifier, either
onboard or ashore.

Cleaning the tanks would be a service available at all Class A-C starports
and many Class D, for some reasonable fee (Cr1 per dton cleaned, in local
currency?).

\'thud\' - possibly sting as well if in a particulate-heavy atmosphere. Oh yeah, and major 
amounts of radiation. Integration of meson play with imbedded metallic objects is left 
as an exersise for interested Sayat (have we lost our PG-13 rating yet ?).

Secondly, Kenji asked about economics data. My preferred solution is to provide a per 
capita GDP figure, income distribution (1=perfect income equality, 0 = perfect income 
inequality) and interestellar trade as % of GWP. This will provide most of the 
information players need, and enough to extrapolate most of the rest.

Thirdly, there is a major debate going on at the moment about cultural values. Without 
being judgemental, I am going to make these points

1) there is a strong thread of violence being wrong in many religions and philosophies 
(see for example \'Thou shalt not kill\' as one of Moses\' Commandments compared to the 
work of, say, Hugo Grotius on Just Wars)

2) most governments have seen a need to have access to orginised violence, and people 
prepared to perpetrate it on command

3) most cultures have examples of figures who have refused wrongful orders, or who have 
carried out correct orders wrongly (I am thinking of Mush Morton here, who machinegunned 
survivors in the water after sinking their ships)

4) many cultures have a concept of internalised honour, while others only consider 
\'honour\' or \'status\' to be relevant when recognised by other group members

5) most individuals have a \'loyalty horizon\' - people are willing to do things for 
members of their family that they would not do for a stranger

6) most cultures have examples in their history of conflict between loyalties - if you 
are loyal to your country and to the ideals of Democracy, what do you do when your 
country orders you to crush a democratic government ?

Now, the Imperium does not have to follow our own assumptions on what is right action 
and what is not. I find it almost certain that Imperial individuals will have very 
different ideas of right and wrong, that may seem strange to us. For example, where a 
noble has opposed feudal obligations, they may see no problem in proposing that for one 
month he fights for one side, then for the other for a month, and so on. That idea is 
ludicrous to someone with the idea of a citizen having one over-riding loyalty (to their 
nation) but it could make perfect sense to someone from a culture that values noble 
oaths over mere citizenship.

During my life I have seen and experienced horrors which I hope that people 
can\'t even imagine. To me this attitude (and many others expressed by more 
than one person) is offensive and disgraceful, it sickens me to my stomach. 
Real people die in wars in ways more horrible than we care to think. There are 
no white hats and there are no black hats. The Japanese and Germans are no 
more responsible for the horrors of Nanking and Achwitz than the Isreali\'s and 
Americans are for Deir Yassin and Wounded Knee. They no more deserved 
destruction and death. War is not about justice and honour, it is about 
expediency and politics. This will be my last post on this matter. I have no 
desire to remain here, goodbye.

I think we have gotten way off onto a topic (or perhaps two) 
that no longer has any bearing on Traveller. It has touched 
corners of our souls that are deep and personal and the 
messages are reflecting that.

When we stray too close to deep moral and philosophical 
areas, our close kinship as Traveller players, referees and fans 
is tested as our differences in politics, religious beliefs, 
political and moral viewpoints are highlighted

t is time to put aside this discussion for the good of our 
Traveller community here on TML.

Note carefully that it requires the Moot to provide et cetera; it
says nothing about whether the Emperor is required to follow that
advice et cetera.  The entire Moot can say "This is a Bad Idea,
Your Imperial Majesty.  We urge you not to do it." The Emperor
can say "Get stuffed.  I want to do it, and I am the Emperor.  It
will be done."  The Moot then has two choices:  say "As you will,
Your Imperial Majesty.", or call for a convention of the full
Moot, during which they may put forth for vote a proposal to
dissolve the Imperium.  If this vote succeeds by a majority of
the _sum_total_of_the_nobles_of_the_Imperium_, the Imperium
ceases to exist.  Along with it goes the Imperial nobility, the
Imperial armed services, and so on.

Actually, the power of law in the Imperium derives from the
barely restrained megalomania of a certain Cleon Zhunastu, and
the acceptance of his assertions in the Warrant.  The _stability_
of the Imperium relies on, as with all governments, the consent
of the governed.  The Imperial nobility can withdraw that consent
- - but they\'d better be so convinced collectively that the Emperor
has so lost the mandate that they\'d be willing to collectively
commit hara-kiri - messily - to show it.  The right of
assassination has no basis in the Warrant, and was basically a
Moot running amok, unless Cleon the Mad had no qualified issue.
Cleon\'s madness would not be "just and proper cause" (Article
III) for disqualifying the heirs unless it was clearly exhibited
in those heirs.  The "right of fleet control" that was asserted
by Olav is equally nonsense under the Warrant.

Technically, the Imperium lost legitimacy when Cleon II abdicated
and the Moot confirmed Artemsus Lentuli, unless Cleon had first
_adopted_ Artemsus _and_ designated him Heir Apparent.  Accepting
the Lentuli dynasty as legitimate, it _may_ have been
delegitimized upon Artemsus\'s death, as the Moot did not confirm
the eldest child, but instead confirmed Martin I (the _second_
child.  Non-service in government is not in and of itself
necessarily a disqualification).  The next questionable move was
the ascension of Cleon III (the Mad); accepting the Lentulis as
legitimate gave the best claims to the siblings of Martin II and
their issue; if no qualified heir could be found among them, the
siblings of Martin I and their issue are next in line, and only
if no suitable heir can be found among them are the descendants
of Cleon II considered.  If Porfiria was in fact the best claim
among the Lentulis, she should have been considered _before_
Cleon.  The rest of the Lentuli dynasty, ending with the death of
Nicolle, was as legitimate as could reasonably be asserted, given
the prior circumstances.

Subsequent Emperors, by assassination (Cleon IV), right of fleet
control (Olav), and self-proclamation by any theory (Constantus,
George) are absolutely nothing more than usurping pretenders.
The circumstances of Nicolai\'s confirmation are unknown, but he
may have been the most legitimate ascension between Nicolle\'s
assassination and the Core Disintegration (of 613-615).  Also
possibly more legitimate were the ascensions by "Moot election"
(Jerome, Jacqueline I, Ramon I); there is nothing governing _how_
the Moot selects an Emperor in the absence of any qualified heir.
However, the fact that this rationale is specifically called out
suggests that it was not the "normal" confirmation/selection
procedure, but yet another irregular method devised to give a
veneer of legitimacy to one who would otherwise be yet another
usurper.

The post-Disintegration Barracks Emperors (Cleon V through
Gustus) are all of questionable legitimacy, but arguably no more
questionable than Nicolai.

The ascension of Arbellatra was possibly the most responsible
exercise of the Moot power to act in absence of a clear heir
(Article III).  The subsequent Emperors of the Alkhalikoi
dynasty, through Strephon, form a case study of the _proper_
pattern of Imperial succession under the Warrant.

The assassination of "Strephon" (actually a clone - an act of bad
judgement on Strephon\'s part, compounded by concealing his
absence from his family and the Moot - or did he?), which set off
the Rebellion, and indirectly the Collapse, represents a
situation where previous poor decisions and an unwillingness to
act decisively led to problems.  The key previous poor decision
was the (illegitimate) creation/acceptance of the "right of
assassination"; had this never been enshrined in any way, Dulinor
would never have been able to make a claim to the Iridium throne.
The proper order of succession would have been to Iphegenia, then
to Varian, then to Lucan (given that none of them had issue at
the time of the assassination).  Iphegenia was killed with the
clone of her father by Dulinor (Iolanthe would have had no
legitimacy other than that of Strephon.  Upon his death,
regardless of her survival, Iphegenia becomes the Empress, and
Iolanthe becomes the Empress Mother), thus handing the succession
to Varian.  Varian was murdered under mysterious circumstances,
possibly by Lucan; nevertheless, it is clear that Lucan would
have been the most legitimate claimant to the throne.  The Moot
can either confirm or disqualify; there is no third route.  They
chose to do neither (unwillingness to act decisively), and
compounded that error when they accepted Lucan\'s (illegal)
"dissolution" of the Moot.  The subsequent actions of the
archdukes of Vland, Antares, Ilelish, and even Deneb, and of Duke
Craig of Daibei were perhaps necessary, but definitely illegal
without the Moot meeting to dissolve the Imperium.  Also
egregious was the actions of the nobles who rallied to Margaret,
who had no legitimate claim at the time of the assassination, and
of Margaret herself, who accepted the de-facto declaration of
independence without actually proclaiming it.  Complicating the
matter was the fact of Strephon\'s survival; as it was a clone
that "bought it" from Dulinor, there should have been no question
of succession - if the Moot or the family knew, they should have
said something right off, and perhaps headed off the whole thing.
Lucan\'s failure to do so (assuming he knew) makes him a usurper,
with absolutely nothing to figleaf him into legitimacy.
Strephon\'s subsequent de-facto abdication was moot, and
technically deficient (as he did not _publicly_ abdicate); there
was no legitimacy to his acceptance of Norris\'s declaration of
independence - although you could make a shaky case that he
accepted Norris as Regent for Avery and withdrew Imperial
hegemony over the rest of the Imperium.  Avery\'s status as heir
is illegitimate prior to Lucan\'s death; questionable afterwards,
since we don\'t know whether Iphegenia, Varian, or Lucan had any
issue prior to that time - or whether Strephon had any other
acknowledged then-living issue.  If none of them had issue, _and_
Strephon formally adopted Avery and named him heir, then Avery is
the best claimant to the Iridium Throne.

Norris\'s actions to democratize the Regency were arguably legal,
as he was acting with the Emperor\'s sanction; however, in order
to complete the process, the nobility _must_ meet in Moot and
dissolve the Imperium - then, the power brokers of the area can
meet and form whatever kind of government they want.  Barring
that, Norris\'s failure to install Avery when he reached his
majority, and Avery\'s failure to either assert that right or
publicly abdicate, represent the final abandonment of any
legitimacy to any "Imperial" government - or any government
derived from the Imperium\'s legitimacy.  Certainly, Seldrian
Aledon had no legitimate claim - even as Regent - to the
leadership post she held on her true-father\'s death; Caranda
should not have been Regent but Emperor, as he has the most
legitimate claim through Avery.

There\'s some good stuff (even if I do say so myself) on Military Retirement
Benefits in Dark Star #2, available from Hyperbooks.com online bookstore (you\'ll
have to ask Terry specially, as he doesn\'t have it listed on his web page).

Things like Medical Care, Transport rights, Legal defence rights, rights to
Government jobs, right to use Military/Government transit hostel facilities etc.

Makes the military a sensible career choice.

  AFAIK the Soviet effort against the major element of the Japanese army
was a very substantial undertaking. The big difference is that they
surrendered in droves, having received a treatment many times worse than
that in their clashes in the `30\'s - the Japanese army simply wasn\'t well
equipped by 1939 standards, and the Sovs were doing fairly well in `45.
Anyway, I\'ll try and look it up.

  Wait a sec - wasn\'t the South abandoned to Hanoi anyway? And that\'s 
without getting into the interesting question of who should or shouldn\'t
have been intervening there (hmm, Vietnamese "intervening" in Vietnam -
now there\'s an interesting concept).

  And a number of Western states didn\'t allow Jewish refugees fleeing Germany
to enter before the war - and they didn\'t have to worry about offending the
Nazi\'s. And quite frankly, if the Swedish and Swiss authorities _knew_ the
scale of what was happening, then so did the Western governments - ours. They
were weak and within arms (well, Wehrmacht) reach. What were our excuses?

...
>Yes, but one of a small handfull out of a whole nation...  A

  One individual who probably saved as many Jews from death as most
of the efforts of the Western armies, short of the Commonwealth
blocking the German drive on Egypt (and Palestine, which certainly
gives me the shudders).

This book is pretty ideal for anyone that hasn\'t already shelled out cash
for many of the original CT Alien Modules (otherwise you are simply getting
text that you already have).  For good Vilani info, try to locate a copy of
the MT alien book: "Vilani & Vargr".

Why thank you for your input, but I have served & served with honor in the
USMC...  I have seen the face of war, my father, & grandfather both saw the
face of war...  Hell, every male member of my family has served this
country well & honorably in the time of its most dire need...  I have never
said that the Japanese or German peoples are to blame, but their
governments were...  A subtle difference, but a major one...

In war there is only victums, on both sides...  The civilian who is back
home is as much a victum as the Marine, soldier, sailor, or airman who the
government sends out to fight in it...  As to Nanking, Achwitz, Deir
Yassin, & Wounded Knee, well men did evil & were at fault...

As for justice & honor, well war is not about those Ideas, but about the
muck that makes up what humans really are at heart, animals...

I know that the Japanese government still owns millions of dollars to the
US for WWII & should be made to repay it

See ya...

> Should we hold you responsible for the fate of the Aboriginies?

Nope, do not live in OZ, as for the Native Americans, well, my Grandfather

had any contact with them until he was 60 yo & took a trip out west...  So
I would have to safely say, that I have nothing to do with the Native
Americans, other than be dating one...

From what I know, the Russians fought well against the Japanese, but their
major threat was the Nazis...  So after the Nazis were done, then they
could turn to the Japanese...

Maybe, but as an allied nation-state we (the USA) had to intervene in
Vietnam, that plus the fact that the North rigged the voting for the left &
the people of \'Nam by & large voted not to be commie...

This is true & I do not deny that fact, but what about the rest of his

never seen any deckplans for the 200 ton Free Trader (well I do have Snapshot,
but the Scout Courier in that game looks nothing like the Type S\'s I see
elsewhere, so I have to asume that the Free Trader has also changed...), and
the 400 ton Patrol Cruiser from Book II. I have seen a zillion pictures of
them from the outside, but not deckplans. Has a third party (like FASA or DGP
or Seeker games) ever printed any deckplans of these two vessels (or GDW for
that matter...)? I have Fat and Far Traders, but would love to have a Free
trader too. I have seen the deckplans on the Missouri archives online, but I
can never get the d--n things to print properly; I just get the upper left

joining in on this particular discussion thread.

The diversity of viewpoints, political and religious philosophies gives
this list a unique flavor.  It also leaves us vulnerable to some
particularly unpleasantness when they clash.

I think we are all pretty sure of where we stand on certain issues, and
the venting that is occuring on the list has reached the point of being 
unpleasant.  This is no longer passionate discussion, but ranting
and, in some cases, personal attacks. Could we agree to disagree and move
back to discussions more pertinent to the TML?

There are deckplans for the Type A2, type S, Type J, and quite a few other
small ships in \'Traders and Gunboats\'.

Seth,
Unless you happen to be able to locate a sadle stitch stapeller I recommend
using a large needle and heavy thread. You can use the existing holes left
by the staples or add others, then just stitch the books together. Should
hold up for years.

I\'ve seen the plans somewhere, but... They are not in Traders and Gunboats,
much to my surprise.

Give me a private mail with the program you\'re using to try and print out
the plans, I might be able to tell you what\'s wrong. It\'s probably just a
matter of correcting the image size when you print them. I don;t remember
d/l\'ing those plans but in Photopaint I\'ve managed to print most files out
on all of the HP deskjets here (800, 855 and 1000) without much problems.

Thanks Doug, I liked that design.

Well it really wasn\'t a combat craft when I designed it. It was my answer to
one of the other threads that\'s been kicked around lately, "How do traders
have famillies" the City class was just that, a small town in space. It had
quite a number of Mobile Fabrication Facilitiy units included, along with a
lot of cargo space. One thing we\'ve used it for is to plant colonies. The
colonists travel "low berth" in the cargo hold along with live stock etc.
The City takes up orbit with it\'s auxillaries mining either a planetoid
belt, if available, or a moon for raw material. The MFF-10\'s go to work
churning out the hardware for the colony. When the colonists wake up they
have a ready-made settlement. Depending on the contract, one of the "Cities"
might stay in orbit for years, providing a pre-made space-based
manufactoring facility until the colony is ready.

I came to the conclusion that they were really independant habitats with
J-drives. Kinda like a forruner to Commander-X\'s Planet X.

Hmmm. You\'ve just reminded me of a series of stories that refs can mine
for some nasty little scenarios. 

Mack Reynold\'s "Section G" stories. 

"Section G" is a section of a department of the United Planets that
"doesn\'t exist".  The United Planets is a sort of "overgovernment" for
human space that by its charter *can\'t* interfere with planetary
affairs. The problem is that they\'ve discovered a civilization coreward
of their territory. One that\'s *many* TLs above theirs. It\'s also a
socirety that is *so* caste-ridden as to effectively be a hive culture.

This wouldn\'t be a problem except that they\'ve found ample evidence of
what happened to planets that tried to steal technology from the
aliens. The planets were given a methane/ammonia atmosphere by
virtually *instantaneous* interstellar teleportation. This wiped out
the populations and left the planet to re-develop life from the ground
up. 

So the UP wants to have the planets ready to deal *intelligently* with
contact, even though their charter forbids meddling. So they created
the department. Section G is a sort of special operations unit. They
make use of people with "unique" talents for covert infiltration teams.

One team that I recall fondly had your typical absent-minded scientist
type, a little girl, an ordinary looking fellow, and some others I
don\'t recall. The trick is that they aren\'t what they appear to be.

The "scientist" type is from a 3g planet. Upon being introduced to the
head of the section, who wants to know what he can possibly do on a
team, he walks over, picks up the section head\'s *metal* desk, and
tucks it under one arm, and strikes a casual pose leaning against the
wall with the other arm.

Section head: "That desk weighs a ton!"
   Scientist: "No, it doesn\'t have the heft."

The little girl is an adult from a planet where people are all
"midgets" (or whatever the term is for people who are very short but
properly proportioned) and average 3 feet tall. She has to wear a
breast binder, but does a great imitation of a little girl. She\'s great
for "wandering" into secure areas, or distracting guards.

The average looking guy has a hobby. He throws things. *Anything* he
can pick up easily. With deadly accuracy. 

Another member is a woman with eidetic memory. 

The rest of the folks are equally abnormal. They make a great team
because they don\'t *need* all the fancy gadgets. They don\'t have to
smuggle out documents, because they\'ve got the lady with the memory.
Ditto for smuggling *in* plans that might be incriminating.

Throw these folks against your players and watch the fun begin.

And the folks who deplore the loss of lives conveniently forget that
the Japanese were preparing a "to the last man" defense of the home
islands. Both US *and* Japanese estimates of the "civilian" casualties
in such an invasion ran into the multiple millions. As well as reducing
all the major cities to piles of rubble. 

Compared to *that* Hiroshima and Nagasaki were minor. 

And don\'t forget that after Hiroshima the military was *still* in favor
of defending to the last person (not merely to the last *soldier*)
rather than surrendering. 

It took Nagasaki to get them to ask the Emperor\'s opinion.

This is *all* in the records.

That was a Merchant Spaceman claiming the right under a specific law in

More to the point, check "Glory Road". It had the detail that a soldier
being mustered out at a location outside the US had a year during which
his discharge papers allowed him to ride military transports on a
"space available" basis until he reached the states.

The is (or at least *was*) a "Military Space A Travel FAQ" that deals
with exactly this subject. 

Assuming we project this forward to the Imperium, you get to hitch
rides on non-combat vessels for a period of time after your discharge.
This is subject to their having the space available. And to some extent
to whether or not you can argue that it is going to get you closer to
"home". 

Military personnel on leave can use the same system by using their ID
cards and leave papers.

Military dependents can also use the system, by using their dependent
ID, but they rank lower on the priority scale than active military on
leave. And I\'m not sure where discharged personnel rate. 

Given the size of the Imperium, and the time it takes to move around, I
rather expect that the Imperial forces give you at least a couple of
years (I might go as far as 5 years). It doesn\'t really cost them
anything as they have to *budget* as if the ships will be full anyway.

Well, one *big* limit on longevity is the fact that unlike cells in the
rest of the body, nerve cells in the central nervous system *don\'t*
reproduce. 

So for the rest of the body, anagathics can work by doing something as
"simple" as restoring the teleomeres[1] on the ends of DNA strands, or
preventing them from being lost during duplication.

But for the brain (and spinal cord?) the problem is doubly difficult.
First of all, the cells don\'t replicate. So when they finally die, they
don\'t get replaced. And add to that the "blood-brain barrier". This is
a membrane that seperates the brain from the bloodstream. It\'s *very*
difficult to get chemicals to cross this barrier. It\'s intended for the
protection of the brain from things like infections, but it makes
getting drugs to it a real pain.

So, one limit on anagathics could be that they "merely" ensure the
proper duplication of DNA. So while your body stays young, your brain
slowly loses cells.

This happens *very* slowly. I think I recall a figure of something like
10% loss by age 90. Extreme radiation exposure can greatly increase
this. As can head injuries.

And the brain has a lot of "spare" capacity (but nowhere *near* the
"only 10% is used" stuff you keep hearing, that\'s based on what they
knew in the 1930s!). So the effects will take a while to show up.

I\'d model this by requiring aging rolls against Intelligence, but at a
reduced rate. I\'d say that Education might also be affected (loss of
memory). 

Anagathics that counter this could have *really* weird side effects.
Just look up the effects of various disorders caused by brain chemistry
imbalances. Depression, Bipolar disorder (used to be called
manic-depression, but was changed because it really *isn\'t* related to
ordinary depression), various schizoid and psychotic disorders
(including megalomamia and paranoia). 

And some have speculated that re-growing brain cells could have a side
effect of wiping memory. So without memory storage and transfer
technology (which has other uses that players won\'t want to be on the
receiving end of[2]) an "immortal" may eventually have to choose between
death of his body and death of his personality.

BTW, the same concerns about loss of brain cells apply to anyone who
tries cloning new bodies and transplanting the old brain into it.

[1] teleomeres are "junk" DNA at the ends of DNA strands that are there
solely because every time a strand is copies a little bit from the end
*doesn\'t* get copied. So this "junk data" allows for multiple
duplications before any real information gets lost. Much of aging is
thought to be due to the gradual loss of genetic info once the
teleomeres are gone.

[2] If you can record memories, you can in effect "read minds". You can
*certainly* find out anything a person has in their long-term memory.
And if you can write memories back into an empty brain, you can likely
re-write ones that are already there.

If you can access *short-term* memory, you\'ve effectively got
telepathy. See Spider Robinson\'s "Death-Killer" for a sample of the
possibilities. 

And this would make life just a bit *too* interesting for players. So I
advise against mind-recording, mind-wipe, and mind-write technologies.
Unless the first folks to get them are *angels*, the result is worse
than any dictatorship ever imagined.

  A lot of them just languished in jail, plus leftists like labour activists
and academics could simply ride things out by keeping their mouths shut -
the political police (Kemputai?) were pretty efficient but focussed only on
vocal dissent, IIRC.

  The government certainly refuses to discuss war guilt or reparations to
this day (at least since the "final" settlement with the US occupation
regime); FWIW, everything I\'ve read indicates that all but their own
nationalist fringe ("The Japan That Can Say No"?) has accepted their
responsibility and their punishment.

  As Kenji pointed out, the "final" status (i.e. the current situation as
viewed by the Japanese gov\'t) is that agreed to/imposed by the US occupation
authorities, regarding both war criminals and reparations. Their current
position appears to be more closely tied to domestic concerns than the actual
cash outlay required to modestly compensate the few surviving victims. I\'ve
no idea about US claims to reparations, although those would be much more
likely to have been extinguished by that final settlement.

Of the four Traveller charecters I have played FTF in the past 4 or 5
years most were or had been in LTR\'s and/or had children or wards.  This
is one of the more interesting aspects of role playing (as opposed to
roll playing). 

I happen to think that most player charecters are the product of
dysfunctional families  - why else are they out their risking their neck
if not because of some suconscious sense that their life or death won\'t
really matter :)

Sir Sigrid Ottawa (female ex Mechanic, ex Belter, ex Scout) started the
campaign the product of a recent divorce & ended up in a relationship
with a high noble.  At the time of her death they had a serious side
relationship going although his position would not permit him to marry
her.  She also was in the process of becoming legal guardian to her 17
year old half sister after their fathers death & despite the fact that
said sister had tried to kill her.  The fact that it was due to Zhodhani
deep conditioning or not forgiving attempted murder takes a commitment
to family values.

Baron Trier dehah Tarlineal, (male Imperial Navy Flight branch) a
Darmine, was single at the start of the campaign & was denied
reenlistment when Admiral Count So & So\'s daughter complained that Trier
wasn\'t monagamous enough for her.  In the course of the campaign he
happened to end up in a political marriage of convenience to another
part Darmine minor noble which did not in any way hinder his very
promiscuous bisexual escapades.  He had no children he was aware of.

Fred Grandy (male ex Merchant, ex Rougue, ex Agent - the boy next door
type, except for being a cannibal) gradually foungd himself growing
attracted to another PC (despite the fact that she would actually let
sunlight strike her body & did not enjoy the other, other, white meat). 
He proposed marriage to her, and did not receive an answer, mere hours
before ending us mostly dead (but possibly still revivable on a high
tech world) in a gunfight.

Orina Melinte (female Merchant, age 38 ) had an 18 year old son who had
just run off to join the Imperial Marines.  She was a bit scarred from
past relationships & did not consider immediate family important.  As a
Gypsy (Earth Romany are out their among the stars in that Traveller
universe) she thought that non Rom were not really the same sort of
people as Rom (who were family) and that taking advantage of them for
the benefit of the people was acceptable.

  The Soviets killed around 20,000 Japanese troops in clashes in fall `39,
mostly before Germany invaded Poland. of course many Chinese would argue
that WW II was already long underway by this time.

  The Soviets, _in accordance with their commitments at the Yalta meeting_,
invaded Manchukuo August 9, 1945. Over a million men extensively equipped
(and using US trucks, boots, food and av-gas, of course) would encircle
the Kwantung Army and neutralize it within a week, killing nearly one
hundred thousand Japanese troops in the process. By that time those troops
(400,000+, although not all available for redeployment) represented the only
strategic reserves outside the home islands as well as garrisoning the only
industrial capacity with access to resources, although doing anything with
those capabilities was moot given the effective destruction of the Japanese
merchant marine.

  By some observers, this had more to with the Japanese surrender than
the nuclear bombings (not at all sure about that, myself). In any case
the Soviet involvement cannot seriously be considered minor, although it
clearly was of significantly less importance in reversing Japanese
expansion* than the US immense efforts.

from over-running a wider defensive perimeter and major industrial
and raw material assets)

  There was quite an interesting article in a recent JMH that looked at
the origins of the "million Allied casualties" figure, and concluded
that it was an informed SWAG that was probably the best info going, and
accurate enough with hindsight (it might have been too low). Given the
nuclear option I\'ve yet to hear why the US should have chosen not to
bomb Hiroshima instead of sticking to the planned landings.

  You\'re quite right in indicating that Japanese losses would have
been staggeringly large, although I wouldn\'t expect the US to be held
responsible for what the Japanese insisted on inflicting on themselves.

  Luckily, by Trav TL\'s you need to be pretty well equipped to handle
combat armoured troops (at least in CT Striker), so civilians have to
try fairly hard to make themselves worthwhile targets.

  Admittedly they were largely second rate troops, but the Kwantung
Army did surrender en masse, which may very well have been indicative
of their assessment of the larger state of affairs. AFAIK, no credibly
conclusive answer has been reached about when the Japanese would have
surrendered, and in the current circumstances I won\'t venture an opinion.

It\'s perfectly possible to store *ova*. We do it now. Ditto for
fertilizing them with stored sperm. And for fertilizing them in a test
tube and implanting the fertilized in a host mother. All things we can
do right now.

I can see the genetic material being stored by some of them against an
accident or eventual death. Once they die the material is used to
create an heir. 

But this wouldn\'t be all that common. It\'d require a person with a
*much* longer term view than most folks.

Well, the big problem is that LH2 is a cryogenic liquid, which leads to
certain handling problems. 20 K is one *low* temperature. 253 C *below*
zero.

Also, Hydrogen being a *very* small molecule will leak through any sort
of normal seal as if it wasn\'t even there. 

But I will grant you that normal tanks are already set up for this. You
might run into trouble with a cargo like grain because of the
insulation on the tanks. A little bit of moisture produces some heat
from fermentation type activity. Normally this would escape. But not in
an LH2 tank! So fire is more likely, unless you store the grain in a
dry nitrogen atmosphere (which is a good idea anyway).

BTW, I just recalled an *important* detail regarding liquid hydrogen
storage. They learned the hard way early in the Apollo program that
there are *two* forms of the hydrogen molecule. 

In one, the spin axes of the atoms point the same direction. In the
other, they point in opposite directions. One has more energy than the
other. The higher energy form will spotaneously convert to the low
energy form, releasing the energy difference as heat. And this is
enought to *boil* LH2. 

So they have to run the LH2 past a catalyst that converts it all to the
low energy form. 

Nasty way to sabotage a ship is to remove the catalyst from the fuel
system. They\'ll fill the tanks, start for jump and have the tanks
venting madly (or even rupturing!) within the hour!

Fill the tank with a nitrogen or other inert gas, as the cargo won\'t
need oxygen, and the nitrogen will prevent problems with some cargos
reacting with oxygen.

BTW, oxygen and hydrogen only burn in a fairly narrow range of O2/H2
ratios. Outside that range they react slowly if at all. So you can vent
the tank to ambient pressure, then run oxygen thru a grid like on a
catalytic heater and it\'ll quietly, harmlessly convert it to water and
heat. 

But it\'d be easier to just pump it down to a near vacuum and then fill
with something inert.

Personally, I love the CJ Cherryh style Merchanter\'s and believe you could
use them as a template for Traveller, especially when they operate on a
fixed route...

One of the girls at my secondary school (11-16) had an interest in
following a legal career, and looked at our two week work experience
placement at the age of fifteen as an opportunity to further this ambition.
On her form she indicated that she was interested in soliciting as a career.

In the UK soliciting has a completely different meaning, and you can be
locked up for it ;-)

Fortunately, the teachers decided to give her a placement in a legal firm
instead....

One country divided by a common language?

The other thing you have to consider is thatalthough the social welfare
provisions in Europe tend to be better than the US (IMO) , the cost of
living is higher. For example, we pay roughly the same amount in pounds
sterling as you pay in dollars for electrical equipment. Bear in mind the
exchange rate is something around 1 GBP to 1 USD. ... Similarly, cars are
significantly more expensive, as is fuel (*).

Dom

PS A few years ago I saw some work an economic\'s student friend was doing
for their disseration at the end of their degree - they looked a
differential oil prices, and proposed the theory that if the US Government
taxed fuel (Petrol/Diesel) to the same extent as most European countries)
the entire national debt could be paid off in less than two months.
Unfortunately, it would probably cripple the economy doing so... I\'ve
always wondered if that was still true?

Fine. *You* didn\'t start a brutal and unprovoked war of agression, nor did you
support it (as far as I can tell :-).

On the other hand, I see the whining of second guessing revisionists, and of the
supposedly poor put upon Japanese, about how awful the A-Bombs were. To which I
say, garbage.

No, I wasn\'t there ... and, I guess, you weren\'t either. But I know people who,
in 1945, were young enough to be *bloody* grateful that they wouldn\'t have to
either a) invade the Japanese Home Islands or b) continue fighting the maniacal
little bastards in the SW Pacific.

They didn\'t care for the rights or wrongs of it ... they only wanted to survive.

If *you* had been there, and if *you* had been earmarked for the first wave onto
the beaches for Olympic, Coronet or any other late 1945 operation against the
Japs, well, then I guess you might have the right to say "I\'d rather have died
than have the A-Bombs dropped" ...

Since (and I\'m only guessing this, correct me if I\'m wrong), *you* weren\'t so
designated, then, well, I still say tough luck to the Japs. And note that *I*
didn\'t make the reply you have quoted as mine anyway.

>Real people die in wars in ways more horrible than we care to think. There are 

Yes, and governments have the right - and, goddamnit, the *responsibility* - to
end them with as few casualties to *their own citizens* as possible. FDR and
Truman had no responsibilities to the Japs ... only to the US and Allied troops
(and civilians) who *would* have died if an invasion had gone ahead. All other
considerations are secondary.

>white hats and there are no black hats. The Japanese and Germans are no 
>more responsible for the horrors of Nanking and Achwitz than the Isreali\'s and 

No, the individual Japanese and Germans who stood up and opposed those things
weren\'t ... the rest, well, sorry, but they should have. I know its not fair, no
one ever said it was. But it is ludicrous to expect the Western Allies to pursue
a policy or strategy that saves the lives of their enemies by killing more of
their own citizens.

If you don\'t agree with this, well, might I suggest that the next war you see
that NZ gets involved in, or seems *about* to get involved in, that you offer
your services as a volunteer to die in some other poor sods place who would die
because of your scruples. Then and only then would you have the right to take
the moral high ground.

Uh, wait a moment. You must be aware of some secret vote that was taken on the
matter that no-one else in the real world is.

The "people" of Vietnam were *supposed* to get the chance to make such a vote
after the Geneva Accords in 1956, supposedly by 1958 IIRC ... the US encouraged
a small clique of anti-communist thugs who had no popular support to prevent
this occurring in the south. Why? Well, as even the US acknowledged (privately)
at the time, Ho would have won by a landslide ... there would have been no
*need* to rig the votes ... he was a genuine war hero who had rid the country of
the French.

Just so you know, they pay your way back to your "Home of Record".  The
place you lived when you enlisted/joined the military.  Oh, and Phil there
is another benefit that you left off....free burial with a head stone and an
Honor Guard.  Please, lets not forget that one.  Gives my wife someplace to

Not quite. Most of the operators are straight James Bond types. The
problem is that it takes years of observation and subtle training (just
imagine how difficult it is to train someone to be an effective secret
agent without him knowing that he is being trained!) before they dare
induct a potential recruit because the secret they are guiding is so crucial
that they can\'t afford even one "bad apple". They are always understaffed.
So one of their top supervisors comes up with the idea of a "Special
Talents" group, using computers to track down reliable people with, well,
special talents.

Yeah, seeing her running around bouncing her little ball (concealing a
hypodermic needle with memory-wipe drug) and chanting "Three little girls
in blue, tra la la" is sooo cute...

>She\'s great for "wandering" into secure areas, or distracting guards.

More to the point, she is an olympic class gymnast and can perform
amazing acrobatic feats. The scientist has a trick of throwing her up
to third story windows and at guards.

My favorite is the guy who is the luckiest man in all of human space.

Lucky Guy: "Whew! That was lucky!"

Lucky Guy: "Yeah, wasn\'t that a piece of luck for me?"

Then there is the best bull-whip artist in human space.

>Throw these folks against your players and watch the fun begin.

I once worked on a team of friendly NPCs in my fantasy campaign based on
this idea. I never got around to using them, but the basic idea was that
they should all appear to be dead useless as allies. One was a guy who
"could imitate any bird in the world". What the PCs weren\'t going to
find out until much later was that he could actually communicate with
the birds.

Since the technology dosen\'t exist, it is up to the Ref to decide if it
does or not. In some of my science fiction/superhero scenarios I\'ve used
an "Immortality Virus" that is tailormade to an individual (it dies if
it leaves the body) and replaces dead cells whenever it finds them,
including brain cells. The new cells are naturally empty, but there is
enough redundancy in the brain that it dosen\'t matter (severe trauma
will wipe some content beyond recovery (ane really severe trauma will
kill, of course)).

I haven\'t used it in my TU yet, and I\'m not quite sure I wan\'t to make
it available. If I did, I would propably make it hideously expensive
and/or TL 16 technology.

Re:  GURPS Traveller

For those of you who aren\'t familiar with or don\'t see the utility of
GURPS, this kind of scenario can be created in an easy, simple, and clean
fashion, using the advantages/disadvantages in the basic set:

High ST and Skinny (to keep the normal human appearance)
Dwarf
High DX and Throwing skill (though any version of Traveller could do this,
too)
Eidetic Memory, 2 levels

The other, perhaps less obvious, benefit of GURPS is that all characters
are constructed by design, rather than by chance.  This isn\'t always
necessary or desirable, but it is nice for creating the "referee special"
for a particular purpose.

We now return you to your regularly scheduled program...

For one thing, fuel tanks contain baffles that would prevent you from
using them for solid cargo.

Collapsible tanks are the reverse; tanks that can be installed in cargo
space and used for extra fuel. That is canonical, but there is one problem:
You can\'t use the fuel directly for the jump. Don\'t ask me why; I\'ve never
been able to figure out an adequate explanation. But the rules clearly state
that it can\'t be done. Possibly the same reason why you can\'t use fuel tanks
at least for liquid cargo (whatever that may be).

Demountable tanks can be used directly, but it takes quite a while (several
days, maybe even a week IIRC) to mount and demount them.

Hmm. Maybe you can use fuel tanks for liquid cargoes, but the switch takes
so long (cleaning the tanks) that it would eat up the profits?

Operating costs would be the same, but the bank payments and return on
investment will still be based on a more expensive ship (bigger jump
drive, higher TL), so they would not be able to compete with ships built
specifically for those jump lengths.

THe information is slightly contradictory. The way it reads to me, the
named fleet of each sector is just a collective name for all the fleets
of that sector. OTOH, the Corridor Fleet is specifically said to consist
of four fleets (with numbers given), none of which are identical to the
16 fleets shown as stationed in Corridor. OTTH the Corridor fleet and
the Core Fleet appears to be the only named fleets with separate numbered
fleets (every other numbered fleet is shown on the map, mostly one to a
subsector). And the Corridor Fleet that Lucan orders away from Corridor
seems, by implication, to contain all numbered fleets (and subsector
fleets) stationed there (I mean, "stripping" Corridor of 4 out of 20
fleets (or 4 out of 28 if we count the subsector fleets too) would hardly
leave Corridor helpless).

For one thing, her earning potential is reduced by the number of cabins the
family occupies and her expenses are up by the life support cost for the
family. Bringing up children on a spaceship is much more expensive in the
TU than in, say, Cherryh\'s Alliance/Union universe.

What I\'m about to say is based on information for which I cannot vouch. The
last time I was involved in this discussion I was told that the Japanese
refused to surrender _unconditionally_. At the time when the first bomb
was dropped, the only condition they still insisted on was that the
Emperor\'s life should be inviolable.

Now, if that is true, the situation appears to be quite different from the
one Doug and Phillip believes in. If the only alternatives really were to
bomb or to invade, then a case can certainly be made justifying the bomb.
But if the alternative was between plea bargaining with one war criminal
and killing hundred of thousands of people, then I wonder if those defending
the decision is quite as sure that they are right?

It comes down to whether you believe in the concept of civilians or not. If
you don\'t, then anything goes. If you do, the situation was a lot less
clearcut.

The problem is the DPI rating of your printer vs. the DPI rating of the
image.

For example, if the Image is at 50 DPI, but your printer can print 500
DPI...well, you can see how that might screw things up :)

Possible solutions:
  a) Tell your viewer program to "stretch to fit", if it has such an
option. Remember to tell it to keep the aspect ratio. The problem with
this is jagglies...basically it "blows up" the image, making each pixel
larger.
  b) Use an image manipulation program and "resample" the image.
Photoshop, Paint Shop Pro, and others all do this. You\'ll want to
convert the image into 24-bit color before you do it, so the program can
anti-alias correctly. Done correctly, this will enlarge the image
without the jagglies. I\'ve done it many times with my copies.
  c) Tell your printer to print in a lower DPI mode. If you can find out
what DPI the image is at...try to place your printer in the same mode.
Thus, you\'ll get more of a "true size".

Most of the carriers I have seen detailed are fighter carriers as opposed
to rider carriders.

You\'re wrong there. The Lurenti is a dispersed structure carrying seven
Nolikian battle riders. The design calculations include the Nolikian in
the Lurenti\'s size, but they are actually carried outside.

As to why, there are commercial adavatages to larger ships, though the
gain is minuscule above a certain size. If you are designing a fleet for
use with High Guard combat rules, you don\'t want any combat vessel larger
than the smallest one necessary to mount the largest meson gun available.
With meson guns a hit is very often a kill, so you want as many guns as
possible and you want your opponent to have as many targets as possible.

>Is the Tigress as big as the 3I needs?  They wouldn\'t care
>for a billion-ton ship, would they?

According to High Guard rules the biggest available computer does not
allow any ship bigger than 1 million tons. I can recall mention of at
least one ship class that big: the _Gorodish_ Fleet Tender (_Fighting
Ships_).

    'body' => 'Anybody here ever read any of Timothy Zahn\'s works on the Blackcollars or the 
Cobras?

Cobras were guerilla fighters surgically altered during training to replace as 
much bones as possible with a ceramic composite to make them nearly impossible 
to break.  They were also wired up with some neat high-tech weapons like a 
heavy anti armor laser in their leg, a sonic weapon in their stomach, and 
smaller lasers in their fingertips.  The new bones also had built-in servos to 
increase muscle capacity.  They could jump up a couple stories no problem.  
Running all the equipment was a preprogrammed nonocomputer implanted just 
below the brain near the pineal gland.

Disadvantages were that the bone replacement caused leukemia-like symptoms due 
to the bone marrow eventually dying out, cutting the production of red cells.  
They also come down with arthritis.  Worst of all, the nanocomputer can\'t be 
removed, nor can the Cobra implants be removed without killing the trooper in 
the process.  The nanocoputer was designed and programmed to protect the Cobra 
without regard to bystanders and had a very loose definition of \'attacks\' on 
the Cobra himself; a couple of kids screwed with a demobilised Cobra after the 
war by playing \'chicken\' with him.  The nanocomputer took the groundcar\'s 
approach as an attack on him, jumped him out of the way, then flattened the 
car\'s tires with the fingertip lasers, the only weapon availiable to it.

Some candidates of the Cobra program also scrubbed their psychological exam 
after recieving the initial implants.  These Jects were fitted with a 
nanocomputer that would only control the implanted servos and allow normal 
movement.  Jects tend to be bitter as hell.

Game Effects:  Treat the implants as laser rifle-1 for the leg laser, laser 
rifle-4 for the fingertip lasers for damage.  Treat the nonocomputer as having 
Laser Rifle-2 for hit determination.  Treat the implanted ceramic bones as 
jack-1 armour.  And roll reactions for the nanocomputer as having Tactics-2 
*seperately* from the character.  The implants would give the character a UPP 
of FDFxxx as far as endurance, strength, and dexterity go, but use the 
character\'s *normal* UPP for wound resolution.  (Character is treated as 
wearing Battle Dress-2).  Cobras also start having aging rolls after their 
first term as a Cobra due to the arthritis and anemia.   Finally, Cobra 
implants are *ONLY* availiable to Commandos.

Blackcollars:

The ultimate low tech fighting man.  These commandos were trained to 
infiltrate high tech installations with low tech weaponry:  shiriken 
(\'throwing stars\'), nunchucks, slingshots, and the like.  Blackcollar weapons 
are made of composite materials such as ceramic/carbon fiber, with zero metal 
content to allow them to pass through metal detectors without getting caught.  
Their uniforms are made of ballistic cloth (treat as combat environment suit) 
with a pull up hood.  Anti laser capability is built into their uniforms as 
well.  They are trained heavily in hand to hand combat as well as their 
martial arts weapons, but mostly, they are trained as \'super ninjas\', tactical 
mavericks and masters of misdirection.  Finally, and most importantly, they 
were modified biologically with a drug, Whiplash, that halves their reaction 
times.

Game effects:  

Blackcollars move at Speed 2 in combat for as many rounds as their endurance.  
They must rest for their endurance in hours before they can move at Speed 2 
again, or twice their endurance if they are still in motion.  Their hand to 
hand skills are at +2 during the Speed 2 segments as well as their blackcollar 
weapons skills.  Whiplash is a TL 14+ drug availiable on TL 14+ worlds with 
law level 2- on a roll of 12, no die mods allowed.  1D-3 doses are availiable. 
 Throw Endurance or less on 3D to avoid an allergic reaction, no DMs.  
Commandos may become blackcollars if their hand to hand skills are 2 or better 
and they have at least Tactics-3.

The following is the introduction from the JTAS article on Romany that I
never got around to finishing:


Contact! Romany

Location:  Anywhere in human space, but probably the bad section of a
run-down Class C or D starport.

Situation:  You are the purser of a merchant ship down on her luck.  You
are desperately trying to find paying passengers to fill up her staterooms
before liftoff, when a shabbily but colorfully dressed man approaches you
and offers to make a deal.  His son, he says, has married a beautiful girl
and they are very happy together.  Her family, however, has moved to a
neighboring system, and the girl is almost dead from missing them.  Being
poor, he himself cannot afford two high passage tickets, or even two middle
passage tickets at standard rates.  Low passage is out of the question:  it
is against their religion.  Besides - what if only one of the young lovers
should survive?  What he proposes is to pay for one middle passage ticket,
and then you let the couple both ride on it, double occupancy.

Action:  If you agree, a dozen or so of these brightly clad individuals
appear on your gangway, out of equally bright but shabby vans.  These
people range in age from babies in arms to one great old grandmother, who
presides over the whole circus in a language you\'ve never heard before.
You soon lose count of the number of bags, boxes, children, animals
("pets", you are told), and miscellania that are loaded into and out of the
cabin, saying goodbye, or going along as a last-minute gift.  Finally, the
hatch is closed on those tearfully remaining behind with the vans.

Conflict:  Once in jumpspace, you have a moment to check on your two odd
passengers, who have not left their cabin since the voyage began.  They do
not wish to be disturbed, says the young man.  Maybe it was the unusual
drain on the life support system, or maybe it was just a funny smell coming
from the cabin, but something leads you to get the captain and override the
lock in his presence.  Inside are not two but seven of these people,
together with a number of their livestock.  The women start a wailing that
sets your teeth on edge; the men come forward, both to offer some later
recompense (work, perhaps?) and to forestall any move on your part to
collect right now.  Any attempt at threats, physical force, or coersion

	This is absolutely the most disgusting thing I have ever read on this
mailing list.
This list is for discussion of TRAVELLER, a science-fiction roleplaying
game. It is not a place for racism and hate couched in the guise of
"history". I don\'t care who was "right" or "wrong" at this point. and
before people start talking about "freedom of speech", this is a private
mailing list, and is supposed to be kept on topic. This sickening crap is
OFF TOPIC. I would like to ask Rob, or whoever administrates this list, to
put a stop to this. I would also like to suggest that perhaps moderation
might be in order if this subject is not dropped.

Seconded!!! I feel I am a patriot, maybe more than some, less than others,
but this whole discussion is slowly degenerating to the type of posts that
have driven people from this list before! I enjoy Traveller. I also enjoy
most of the exchenge of information that this list provides. Flamewars over
points in Traveller are (barely) tolerable. What has been coming through
lately is (IMNHO) NOT! Should I wish to read this type of thing I would sign
on to a list where this is appropriate (I am quite sure they are out there,
and would encourage those that wish to continue to find them!)

Please list me as one in favor of a moderated list if this is what is meeded
to put it back on track!

Flames of this message and the thread that has caused it to be written WILL
be totally ignored!

This is *exactly* why I told you to drop this subject.  Do you *honestly*
expect to perpetuate worthwhile conversation on an OT topic on this list
with "hate" like this?  Stop your damn flag-waving... your government is
not going to come to your rescue and back up your views on this mailing
list.

Agreed!  While "freedom of speech" may be a constitutional right obtainable
to some, it also possesses a certain grey area where "hate" is seriously
frowned upon.  Anyone wishing to continue their "hateful" viewpoints about
an event that took place over fifty years ago can create their own ON-topic
mailing list of their own.  Forgive and forget, or do most Americans still
hold a grudge against a few individuals that burnt down the White House a
while back?

I hear this a lot, but I can\'t find any sort of reference -- even a broad

And if they did, so what if it\'s a little problematical?  Eh?  That\'s what

That _is_ a point... I\'d never noticed it before, but you\'re right.  Notice
it\'s not "Gaming" skill or something like that, but specifically "Gambling".
You might be on to something there...

Actually the drug was Backlash. Whiplash was a drug developed by the
resistance on earth which broke the conditioning the aliens gave to ensure
loyalty in certain humans. As the aliens (I can\'t be bothered digging out my
copies of the books to get their names) and their flunkies consider all
conditioned people to be totally loyal this would give the resistance a
major benefit.

anything on it. So, here are a couple of questions, if they\'ve been
asked/answered before and that is on the Web, please just point me in the
right direction.

1) How much radiation protection is superdense? Equal, less or greater than
the equivalent thickness of lead?

2) If the superdense isn\'t enough would nuclear dampers work to reduce solar
flare radiation?

3) (Probably covered some what in 1&2) What effects could be expected on
ship\'s electronics? Obviously communication would be affected (radio), what
about laser (my guess is not but...) and meson (really have no idea on this
one)? Computers Iand other electronics I would expect to be shielded. But
what effects would there be on ship\'s sensors?

Adventure Class Ships, Volume 2. As with much of FASAs deckplan work, it ain\'t
the greatest, but it will do.  The Type T is one of the ships on my list of
deckplans to correct...

 If enough people are curious/interested/willing to help I\'ll do a big list of
printed deckplan sources for my website.  Anyone?

Interesting, but I see one serious problem with this scenario.  You don\'t
have to start taking antiagathics until you are over 30.  Most folks who
are going to have kids do so when they are under 30. 

Some folks won\'t even have decided to become immortal when they have kids. 
What would prevent someone from having a child at 25 then start taking
antiagathics at 30. 

Then again, IMTU, I tend to assume (non-Vilani) human lifespan has been
raised to around 150-200 w/o antiagathics (with limits maximum terms to
prevent munchkinism) so everyone is living a *long* time, the rich just
live even longer.

Cute story.

>One country divided by a common language?

No, soliciting has the same meaning in the US.  ;-> I think the
biggest difference between the UK and US legal professions is we
don\'t make as big a distinction between litigators and
non-litigators as is done in the UK.  We\'re apt to use the terms
solicitor, lawyer, councilor, attorney...shyster and mouthpiece
(it\'s a joke, so don\'t sue me) ;->...interchangably.

Yeah, you\'re right, it *WAS* Backlash the blackcollars took.  Temporary brain 
spasm.  The aliens were the Rylq, if I remember correctly...

The biggest help to the blackcollars in their operations was twofold.  After 
the aliens conquered the humans, they ended up in another war on the other 
side of their space, sucking materials and aliens into the fight.  The other 
thing was the blackcollars\' ability to use the Rylq\'s thought processes 
against them, setting them up to do exactly what they wanted them to do, then 
sneaking in behind them to fulfill their mission.

Great reading.

That depends on the configuration of the baffles.  If they are spaced
sufficiently far apart, small breakbulk cargo could be fit among them
(which would also partially serve to secure the cargo).

Or the baffles could be designed to fold flat when not required - part of
the 5-10% wastage using a tank for cargo.

For what it\'s worth, the deck plans for Azhanti High Lightning do not
include baffling in the fuel tanks, other than dividing the tanks
themselves by deck.  Perhaps one of the engineers on the list can tell us
how necessary baffling is for LH2, with a density of 0.7 tons per m^3.

The only reason I mentioned collapsible tanks was to arrive at an estimate
of how much volume would be wasted in using a fuel tank for cargo; per
FF&S, p. 62, the volume of the tanks without fuel is 5% of their capacity.

>Hmm. Maybe you can use fuel tanks for liquid cargoes, but the switch takes

Possible; the answer depends on how difficult the switch would be.  For a
subsidized or large route merchant, paying a large enough gang to clean the
tanks in time to use them seems to me a small price to pay to avoid wasting
useable cargo space.  For a free trader, where the crew might just have to
do the cleaning themselves, it might well not be worth the effort.  

This has the effect of minimizing changes to the existing trade and
commerce rules as they relate to PC\'s, while going some ways towards making
large-scale trade more viable.

Traveller has not, to date, explored the possibility of liquid cargoes,
although I agree with you that they exist.  Also consider the possibility
of mixing dry bulk cargo (ground ores, in particular) with a working fluid
to make a slurry and handling it essentially as a liquid.  Once loaded,
most of the working fluid could be pumped off or vented to save weight.

>>The question I put to the list, particularly those who have done the

All useful routes are not made of uniform legs.  High jump numbers (I
really mean Jump 3-4) are sometimes necessary, but it would be rare that
they would be required on every leg of every route.

In the here-and-now, OBO and general cargo ships trade on their flexibility
to remain competitive with single-cargo configurations.  I think it has
already been demonstrated (by you, wasn\'t it?) that ships with high jump
numbers are not competitive under the existing Traveller trade and commerce
rules.  I\'m not suggesting that converting fuel tanks will change that
completely; I\'m asking whether it is a valid technique to narrow the gap.

Truth is often a matter of opinion.

You can use your brain and maybe realize that using derogatory comments
like "damn Japs" on an *international* mailing list *might* offend some
people.  If you *honestly* did not expect some sort of reaction after
posting comments like those, you are more naive than I thought.

I have to agree with this analysis.  Not sure I like the "right of
assassination."If that is ina  quasi-legal document, its opens the door
to constant warfare.
If thats canon, I\'d prefer to handle it as an inherently understodd, yet
unwritten
rule for government.  Its dangerous because its a safeharbor for anyone
who
wants to kill the emperor.  The more I think about it, the more glaring
an error
it seems to me, at least with regard to running a government.

How does it work?
A) Assassination fails and the assassins are let go because they were
merely
attempting to exercise their right of assassination?

or

B) Assassination succeeds and the assassin is able to escape subsequent
prosecution claiming he was justified by the right of assassination?

I think the former is ridiculous (no offense to its author - I\'m looking
for an
explanation).  For an emperor to watch failed assassins go free is bad
policy.
The latter seems more plausible, but IMHO, its unnecessary.  The
successful
assassin can be given amnesty, he could be a patsy, etc.

However, if the right of assassination were more along the lines of a
\'legitimate\'
blood fued between rival families (with the emperor and his heirs immune
from it),
then I begin to like it very much.  In fact, there is ancient legal
precedent for this.
There is an ancient Greek stone on which the crime of murder is
detailed.
Essentially, IIRC, it outlines when it is legal for someone to kill
another.  I think
the only legal way was to avenge the murder of ones own family member.
I think there are germanic/nordic/viking traditions along similar lines
with
blood-debts, etc.

Well, thats probably true, but I\'m way back in Milieu 0, Year 0020.  And
the ink isbarely dry.

FWIW, for later years, I would only imagine the Warrant as one of the
various
legal foundations for the 3I, when its necessary to examine them (which
might
be very rarely).  IMHO, to the extent that the 3I has a constitution, or
at least
a body of fundamental laws that most citizens are aware of and rely on,
towards the goal of having a stable and predictable environment in which
to
live and do business, I assume it to be an unwritten one.  Or more
accurately,
an accretion of statements, treaties, etc., that all compile to make a
reasonably
stable whole, albeit with the understanding that it can all be changed
by a
suitably motivated noble.  In this light, the Warrant is only a starting
point.
Next comes sophont rights, in Cleon\'s speech in 17.  Then something to
publicly justify the pacification campaigns.  And so on, and so on.
Certainly, changes will happen along the way so that by 1116, or
whenever,
many of the principles in the warrant may be contradicted by subsequent
events.

Does this mean whoever actually kills the emperor becomes the emperor?If
so, I don\'t want the job.

"The "right of fleet control" that was asserted
by Olav is equally nonsense under the Warrant."

IMTU, Olav borrowed the idea of succession by right of fleet control from
the Rule of Man.  The right was claimed by a number of Emperors late in the
Rule of Man, when the Council of Noble Officers was so fragmented and
divided that it was unable to choose or confirm a successor.  On more than
one occasion, the Chief of Staff to the deceased Emperor took control,
using his control of (most) of the Navy to keep other claimants from
disputing his claim.

Eventually, as the ROM continued to crumble, and regional powers became
more important than the central government, no on eperson was able to
control a majority of the fleet.  Several claimants crowned themselves
emperor, no one claimant controlled more than a third of the Rule of Man.  

Olav, looking for a way to legitimise his coup, used this precedent to
claim the Iriium throne. Since the Third Imperium claimed to be the
successor of the Rule of Man, he felt some justification.  (of course,
succession by right of fleet control was never legal in the Rule of Man -
it was just used for expediency).

Later, when the Civil War had run it\'s course, Arbellatra assumed the role
of Regent until a proper heir to Nicholle could be found.  The \'core
worlds\' surrounding and including Sylea had broken away, ruling themselves
for a time as an independant state, with Sylea as the capital.

Arbellatra, having consolidated her power and persuaded (with the threat of
force in the background) the Core Worlds League to rejoin the Imperium,
renamed Sylea to Capital.  Partly as punishment for breaking away, but
mainly to remind the people and rulers of the core worlds that their fate
was bound to that of the Imperium.

Actually, I recall reading that the last dependent of a WW2 veteran will not die
(or is not expected to die) till around 2010 or later.

So you can add ... Widow\'s Pensions, Children\'s educational benefits, Children\'s
access to OTC (doesn\'t West Point allow children of holders of specific medals,
like the Medal of Honour, automatic access if they meet the academic and
physical requirements rather than having to get their local Senator recommend
them?).

Not a totally awful deal.

that does open a whole realm of software that would be available to
interface the computer with the port systems.  It does bring up and
interesting point, does the Imperium restrict advancement?  these
interfaces would have to be standardized, to permit any ship from anywhere
to be able to interface with them.  Any changes would have to be centrally
controlled, to ensure that changes made on opposite ends of the Imperium
are not mutually exclusive.  So how does the Imperium react to advances in
\'hacker\' technology?

I\'m working on a write-up of my IMTU jump system, which included the
various ways that a jump plan can be generated.  I hope to be able to post
it in the next couple of days. And, of courrse, once I finish
incorporating any suggestions I get from the list, I\'ll be posting them on

Just for the record, my character during university, Dr. K. Iverson, was a
total pacifist and never harmed another sentient creature in his entire
life. He never even fired a gun once in the entire campaign. He was, I
admit, partially a response to what I felt was an overly militaristic
campaign, but was nevertheless an important contributor to the campaign.

I can tell you it wasn\'t easy. And, truthfully, he required all the
ex-marines and mercenaries to get him out of trouble more than once. But I
was able to thwart a hijacking without loss of life on either side, and
able to rid the Annic Nova of the predatory alien (what, you thought they
were all killed by some disease?) without bloodshed.

More.  Alpha and beta particles are, as I recall, fairly easy to stop.  It
is the Gamma which is the killer, and superdense should have a compressed
enough structure to prevent Gamma from sleeting through.  I\'m not clear on
how it would be affected by the radiation, though.  I think because the
molecules are actually compressed against one another, they would not be
able to translate to different energy states.

Nuclear dampers can prevent chain reactions from starting within their
field, but do not reduce ambiant radiation.  So while they will prevent
the runaway chain reaction that culminates in a nuclear explosion,
they would not effectively reduce the radiation front from one that goes
off outside the field from affecting the area, nor reduce the effect of a
solar flare.

I expect that most sensors sitting behind Superdense are probably safe.
The connections to the exterior of the hull would be designed with solare
radiation in mind.

Respectfully, while I agree with the intent, I disagree with the
specifics.

The thread has degenerated to the point where many of us are calling for
it to be terminated.  And, hopefully, the contributers to the thread will
be courteous enough to yield the point and at least take up the discussion
in an alternate venue.

However, calling for the outright squashing of the thread and muzzling of
the participants (some of whom are the most prolific and creative citizens
of the TML) would be, IMO, very much against the philosophy of the list.

According to canon it was a legal precedent introduced specifically to deal with 
Cleon III. It was not intended for any other purpose than that. It works like this:

In 245 the surviving member of the Moot met in secret to deal with the 
"problem" of Cleon III. They decided to remove the Emperor as he was plainly 
unfit. Porifia was selected by the Moot to assassinate Cleon and in return was 
rewarded with the position of Empress.

Now I\'d imagine this was strictly intended as a one off and the "right of 
Assassination" as such was never written down (not the kind of precedent you 
want to commit to paper). However in the Barracks Emperor period this peculiar 
"right" was revived. The following provisions appear to have evolved during that 
period: The assassin must be a high noble (member of the Moot); the assassin 
must personally kill the Emperor by their own hand in the presence of
witnesses; and the Moot must approve the new Emperor.

Thus an unsuccessful assassin would most likely be dealt with by the 
Emperor\'s bodyguard; and even a successful assassin has to be able to justify 
their actions (or frighten the Moot into acquiesce).

My take on all this is that the "Right of Assassination" is strictly an unwritten 
constitutional understanding. As such it would be open to interpretation, but I 
can see in it that the Moot may legitimately remove an unfit Emperor, thus I 
would argue that it places the Moot superior to the Emperor.

NOTE: This is all legal theory. As both the Barracks Emperors and Lucan 
clearly show, the "real" power in the Imperium is derived from the Emperor\'s 
control of the military. If an Emperor wishes to ignore these constitutional 
practices then there is little that can be done about it (Which is why the "Right 
of Assassination" came about in the first place :*>).

I can\'t believe it would be that soon.  Take an 18-year-old kid who joins
up in 1945.  Let him wait until he\'s 48 to have a child (late, but not all
that uncommon).  That puts the kid\'s birth in 1975.  Said kid then lives
the Biblical three score and ten (less than the projected mean lifespan,
btw), and that puts his/her death in 2045.  Even with the child born when
the veteran is only 28, the 70-year-old offspring dies in 2025.  Or look
at it this way:  A child born to a WWII vet *in 1945* will be only 65 in
2010.

In short:  Something\'s fishy with your statement, unless we give a very
liberal interpretation to \'or later.\'

With apologies to Tom Lehr, and in honor of my favorite NPC from the FFW
period:

  Some wish the Admiral had been on leave,
  But others, more practical, can see past the tactical;
  Like the widows and cripples, who firmly believe
  They owe their large pensions to Sir Santocheev.

    You too can command a warfleet,
    When you learn how to abandon your fleet
    "In Vargr or Galanglic I surrender with ease,
    And I\'m learning Zhodane," says Sir Santocheev.

Or, to quote a British Army recruiting poster as designed by Eric Idle:

  "How else can a young man see so much of the world, and still
   get a decent military funeral?"

Yes, which is why the "Right of Assassination" came into being. I\'ve always 
seen the constitution of the Imperium as being an unwritten one (akin to that of 
the Westminster system), which allows for it to changed in exceptional 
circumstances. So in 245 the Moot is faced with an Emperor who is plainly 
ignoring their advice and unfit to rule; what are their options. legally they can 
either do nothing or disband the Imperium; neither of which is practical. 
Therefore they act and remove the Emperor. Thereby they create a new 
constitutional precedent (that the Moot may remove an unfit Emperor).

De facto yes, de jure is another matter entirely. This is an important distinction. 
Most governments need a de jure legitimisation. Thus in the Imperium of 1116 
we can argue that the Moot is de jure superior to the Emperor (various 
constitutional precedents would be advanced to support this); but in the 
situation the de facto supremacy of the Emperor is quite evident.

I\'d see the Right of Assassination as the Moot acting to correct an oversight in 
the Warrant (or at least that\'s how the Moot would argue it). Thus while the 
Warrant is the first constitutional document of the Imperium, I\'d be very 
surprised if its the only one.

I\'d expect that when Cleon II abdicated something was put in place to deal with 
the constitutional issues (perhaps Cleon did adopt Artemsus, perhaps some 
other constitutional avenue was pursued). Martin I, here I\'d extend the definition 
in Article II "provided that such child shall have been publicly acknowledged as 
the rightful heir". Thus we get that the oldest is default, but that the Emperor 
can select a younger sibling (aside just what intrigue went on to keep the elder 
child out). Thus nothing here needs to negate the Warrant. Now on to Cleon III, 
Porifia is on the face of things a more legitimate candidate. However perhaps 
Martin II did not publicly acknowledge any heir and maybe the memory of the 
Julian War had tainted the Lentuli dynasty and the Moot choose to restore the 
Zhunastu dynasty. A close reading of Article III indicates that if the Emperor 
leaves no direct heir "by blood or adoption" then the Moot is _not_ forced to 
automatically chose the closest blood heir. Again nothing here has directly 
contradicted the Warrant.

Cleon IV did not claim "Right of Assassination", if he had there would be no 
doubt as to who assassinated Nicholle (Cleon IV is _believed_ to be 
responsible for her death, if he claimed RoA there would be no doubt). It 
appears that although many of the Barracks Emperors claimed the throne by 
"Right of Fleet Control" this concept was not accepted as a legitimate 
constitutional precedent as it is only mentioned in association of Olav (though it 
probably was used by Donald). Others may have used it to support their 
acceptance by the Moot, in which case it becomes a legitimate constitutional 
precedent.

Definitely. I\'ll leave a constitutional analysis of the issues raised by "Strephons" 
assassination for another post.

And there\'s the guy that they used *once*. He can kill anyone (possibly
any*thing* just by thinking at it). But he needs to see them. I think a
photo is enough. And, as they discovered, cosmetic surgery to give
someone else the face of the victim *doesn\'t* work (ie he\'ll *never*
kill the wrong person). And it worked at interstellar ranges.

Now *that* is a psi power!

I wouldn\'t be at all surprised. I don\'t drive, so I\'m not up on the
price of gasoline (petrol). But I think it\'s a bit above $1/gallon.

Baflles are to stop sloshing and lower density means higher "waves". On
the other hand, artifical gravity and inertial compensators will help a
lot. 

Note that the sort of oil used by bulk cargo ships on earth as fuel is
about one step up from tar. In fact, bunker C won\'t flow at room temp!
I\'ve heard of a ship that had such a failure with a full tank. The
shipyard workers had the chop the "fuel" out with pick and shovel until
they found the broken part of the system. 

So sloshing *isn\'t* much of a concern with seagoing ships:-)

BTW, due to the *extreme* cold of LH2, filling a tank consist of
circulating progessively colder hydrogen *gas* thru it for several
*hours* to precool the tank. If you don\'t the contraction of the metal
(or whatever) as it is hit by the LH2 will likely rip the tank apart.

It *does* depend on the nature of the liquid carried. I can\'t see them
carrying chemically active liquids in the fuel tanks, nor things that
don\'t flow well. So cleanup shouldn\'t be *too* hard. 

BTW, another thing to consider is that since the ship has to be able to
keep LH2 cold, it\'s got to have decent refrigeration capacity. I
suspect that a lot of "liquids" will be carried *frozen*. For one
thing, it makes getting the "net weight" easier. :-)

No it can\'t! I\'ve *worked* with slurries. Unless you keep circulating
them (and do so in a manner that keeps the "holding tank" *well*
stirred), they settle to the bottom of the tank as a "mud". And the mud
is *not* easily converted back to slurry!

On the other hand, powders can be easily "fluidized" by forcing gas
through them. The difference being that unlike surfaces wetted by a
liquid, the gas doesn\'t tend to make the particles stick together. 

You can load and unload the tank with what amounts to a overgrown
vacuum cleaner if you load it dry.

Good question. But another thing to be aware of is that "almost enough"
shielding can be *worse* than "practically none". You see, when the
very high speed protons from the star hit your shielding, if they are
stopped, they\'ll knock loose a shower of what are called secondary
particles. These are moving slower and thus *more* likely to affect
people and equipment. 

So the shielding has to be able to stop not only the primary radiation,
but the secondaries as well. This is why current manned space vehicles
are essentially *unshielded*. The few high energy particles will zip
right through. If they built them more heavily, they\'d *increase* the
radiation exposure by generating secondaries!

Nope. The "radiation" is high speed protons. Nuclear dampers affect the
rate at which certain nuclear reactions take place. But radiation isn\'t
reactions. Nothing to affect.

Actually, it won\'t affect the radios. The reason solar flares cause
radio problems on earth is because they affect the earth\'s magnetic
field and the ionosphere. And any radio that travels more than line of
sight distances does so by bouncing off the ionosphere one or more
times.

Once a flare has messed things up, short wave tends to bounce
unpredictably, or even just get absorbed.

Out in space, the only way the ionosphere will affect your
communications is if you are using wavelengths belong the microwave
band to communicate with the surface of the planet.

The big problem is that if your ship *isn\'t* properly shielded, the
particles going thru will screw up semiconductors at least temporarily.

And the trapped magnetic fields in the stellar wind can induce voltages
in long conductors. A sort of low grade EMP. Currents induced in the
hull aren\'t a problem. But things like radio antennas have to be
*insulated* from the hull. So if you\'ve got an antenna at the bow and
one at the stern, you\'d better have a something like a *big* surge
protector between them and the radios. Ditto for the J-drive and the
lathanum grid. (Hmmm could a flare prevent a jump?)

That *should* be part of the design. But if you have *really* bad luck,
you might burn out the protector. Which means that during the "flare
alert" (the radiation travels a lot slower than light, so the actual
flare may be over with be the time the effects reach you) you  might
hear a loud *bang* from inside a cabinet or junction box. And when you
open it, the failed protector will be easy to spot. It\'d be the broken
hunk of charcoal. 

Don\'t worry, no designer will put them where anything *else* would get
damaged when they fail. This *isn\'t* Star Trek. But when you open that
cabinet or junction box (sort of like a fuse box :-) expect some smoke
and fumes. And you\'ll want to test the other protectors (*after* the
storm, stupid!) to see if they are damaged.

Until you replace the protector, the antenna, Jump grid or whatever it
was protecting is useless. You *can* short around it, but that risks
frying the expensive equipment that it was there to protect. 

Lightning strikes and *nasty* planetary ionosphere activity could also
blow a protector. But normally, they just redirect the charge to
"ground" (ie the hull). It\'s just that there\'s a limit to how much they
can redirect, and they are built to fail as an "open circuit" so the
charge can\'t get to the gear they are protecting.

The ship should have spares. Several even. But you can use a protector
for the radio for the jump driove and vice versa. You *might* be able
to swap one for the radio for one for the radar. You see, they are
designed to pass the *normal* radio waves, jump grid energy, whatever.
But obviously, one designed pass radio won\'t pass "jump field". :-)

So if the protector for a specific system gets blown several times
before you can buy more spares, you either do without the system,
improvise a protector, or short around it and *pray* that you don\'t get
another surge (because then you lose the system).

I wonder if thrust plates need a protector?

No. The way I see it, the *assassin* has to be the person who is going
to be Emperor. So you have to be qualified as a candidate for the
throne. 

This means that Joe Nobody can\'t claim right of assassination. But John
Noble *can*, if his family has a reasonable claim on the throne. (I bet
that there are a *lot* of "Pretenders to the throne" living in areas
outside the Imperium. The Solomani probably have a couple)

Given that the Moot supposedly has the right to approve/disapprove
heirs, I suspect that there\'s a *lot* of complex law dealing with who
can an can\'t be considered as an heir, including distant relatives of
the current line and possibly even descendants of former lines.

Of course, since as I recall, "right of assassination" was used *once*
before Dulinor, most of this is likely a bunch of theoretical papers in
the Imperial Law Journal.

And all this is why I wish we had a standard *vector* format that was
easily accessible to folks with lower end equipment. Then we could just
tell the program how big a printout (or image) we wanted and it\'d
convert to bitmapped for bitmapped devices or issue the proper commands
to vector devices (like my B size plotter). 

Of course, what we\'d all *love is a freeware "CAD for Traveller"
with a matching CAM program for doing the designs.

For those not up on CAD vs CAM, the CAM program would be like the
various ship and equipment design spreadsheets only more so. And being
properly matched to the CAD program means that you could feed the CAM
output specs to the CAD program to produce plans. 

Now *that* would be a nice pair of programs!

All the following, "In My Understanding of Canon"
Neither, although a bit of (B)

The Emperor has the right to have assassinated his/her predesessor.

Thus there is no right to fail :-)

After killing Strephon, Dulinor should have ascended the throne and said
"I am Emperor".

Then if the guards shoot him, or some process in the Moot decides that he
is not the new emperor it can be shown that he did not have the Right
of Assassination.
If the guards and The Moot say "The Emperor is dead, Long live Emperor
Dulinor!" then he did have the Right of Assassination.

The Rebellion can be argued to have started precisely because Dulinor did
not wait to receive the verdict of The Moot.

Technically the guards don\'t have a role, but if the shoot the
assassin then he\'s not going to become Emperor and loses the
Right of Assassination :-)

It\'s not the labor cost that\'s the problem. It\'s the time it takes. In my
calculations I assume that regular freighters can do one jump every 10 days
on the average (this is not canonical, I know). That enables it to move a
certain amount of freight, for which it gets paid. If it takes, say, one
day extra to change over from fuel to cargo and vice versa, and you change
over 10 times per year, then you\'ve lost the revenue for one whole trip. If
it takes longer or you change back and forth more often, the loss is greater.
If the extra revenue you get from carrying more freight is not enough to
compensate you for the loss, you won\'t do it. If it is, you will. So the
answer depends on your assumptions.

Assuming that regular freighters and liners can jump every 10 days will help
much more.

I realize that, but I think it is much more likely that the freight will
be transferred to another ship, allowing the high-jump ship to jump back
the way it came along a route that does allow it to use its full potential.

Yes and no, I have (IMO at least) shown that having uniform freight and
passenger rates for all jump lengths is very, very strange whatever
assumptions you make about the underlying costs. Someone else pointed out
that if freight rates are different from the true freight costs, they can
be gotten around by the ship owner "buying" the cargo, moving it to the
destination system, and "selling" it for the original price+the true costs.

Maybe. But it would be like putting a band-aid on a mortally wounded; it
may help a little, but it won\'t be enough.

What do you mean?  What you have described is normal, isn\'t it?

I GM\'d a group who (during the 5FW in the Spinward  Marches)  had
to sneak a weapons cache onto a neutral planet for future use  by
covert special forces.  On the way to pick up the freighter  they
would use, their beat-up old Gazelle  was  attacked  by  raiders.
The only gunner onboard kept his turret dutifully  aimed  at  the
enemy while blazing away with all  guns.  As  the  raider  passed
behind and below them the gunner inadvertantly pumped shot  after
shot into their  own  engineering  section  (nearly  killing  the
engineering crew)!  Only then did they think to  inventory  their
ship\'s software and found only generic gunnery programs  (ie.  no
safety features).

However, they did make it to the rendezvous ...  changed  to  the
freighter ...  and  got  it  to  the  right  destination  without
misjumping.  Once  on  the  planet  (Tarsus/District  268),  they
encountered a terrorist group.  "Ah, ha.  This must be the covert
Special Ops team." they said, and  handed  over  their  cargo  of
weapons  and  supplies!  Getting  the  weapons  back   from   the
terrorists involved a number of running gun battles  through  the
streets of the capital city, after which  they  were  \'asked\'  to
leave.

This is when the pilot failed his roll ...  during  take-off  ...
and he crash landed the ship through a department  store  display
window in the downtown area.  Once  they  did  make  orbit,  they
_then_ realised they hadn\'t refueled and sent the backup pilot in
the cutter (with fuel scoop  module)  to  the  local  gas  giant.
Oops, he didn\'t make it.

They were eventually bailed out by a  covert  Naval  Intelligence
operative who had been secretly on planet and needed a ride  back
to the fleet.  Of course, he was really a double agent, and  once
back with the fleet he assassinated the  Intelligence  Chief  and
tryed to frame the party.

Fortuneatly,   before   they   could   be   courtmartialled   for
incompetance, the fleet was attacked and the cruiser which served
as their HQ was blown up.  The party managed  to  make  it  to  a
lifeboat and landed on  Mithril  (Sword  Worlds).  After  treking
through snow and ice,  fending  off  wild  animals  and  strictly
rationing the alcohol, they found a  hidden  ancient  site.  That
was when their luck went bad!

I\'ll not say any more as this is currently ongoing.

> Subject: [T98#758] Imperial "Constitutional" Debate and analysis of the Emperors\' List

The issues raised by 1116 are extremely interesting. They show a very deep 
malaise within the Empire; basically by 1116 the Empire was rotten to the 
core. Without reforms (such as Dulinor wanted and Norris effected) it was only 
a matter of time before it collapsed.

It is certain that Strehon acted extremely foolishly and almost certainly 
unconstitutionally. For the Empire to be ruled effectively in crisis it requires 
certainty, with the Emperor absent there can be no certainty. By removing 
himself from the Capital without putting in place provisions for a crisis show a 
dreadful lack of judgement. The only possible "excuse" would be that he did not 
trust his subordinates (which would be in itself *very* telling).

Very very definitely. The "fault" here lies at the feet of Cleon I and the Warrant 
of Restoration which provided no means for the removal of an unfit Emperor. If 
the Moot in 245 had not been faced with the need to remove Cleon III and no 
"legal" means they would never have resorted to such a radical move. However 
this in itself would not have been so bad if it were not for the actions of the 
Moot during the Barracks Emperors period. By accepting Emperors who 
claimed RoA (of the 18 barracks Emperors, 6 claimed RoA and 3 of them had it 
accepted by the Moot) the Moot effectively legitimised a very dangerous 
constititutional precedent, one which up till that time had been of very dubious 
legality. In effect the cause of the ultimate demise of the Imperium was a part of 
its creation.

More critical is the total failure to in any way prepare the 3rd in line for the 
throne. This was an unforgivable error which had predictable results, one can 
also only assume that Varian received similar training for the role of Emperor as 
Lucan. Again the only possible excuse is that the Imperial succession was so 
insecure that no potential rival claimant could be "encouraged".

One can argue that their actions were in fact legitimate. When the succession 
became disputed there was effectively no Emperor and thus the powers of the 
Emperor devolved back to the Nobles on a local level (each noble was required 
to act as Imperial proxy in their area of influence). Part of this authority would 
include the right to grant portions of the Imperium dissolution from the Imperium 
(precedent in the withdrawal from Querion subsector after the 3rd Frontier War). 
Now this appears to be an example of "furious" legal thinking (it is), but this is 
exactly how new constitutional processes might evolve in the 3rd Imperium. In 
this case Norris retains the greatest legitimacy in that he did not seceed, but 
rather choose to function as Imperial proxy.

Margaret has almost as much legitimacy as Norris. While her actions were a 
de-facto secession, she was de-jure merely acting as Imperial proxy.

Strephons survival should have ended the matter right then and there (he was 
still the legitimate Emperor). Again Strephon\'s failure to make adequate 
provisions for a crisis in his absence is thrown into sharp relief.

> Strephon\'s subsequent de-facto abdication was moot, and
> technically deficient (as he did not _publicly_ abdicate);

Yep, his failure to make provison for crisis is further compounded by his failure 
to act quickly to end it, despite the personal cost that would have entailed 
(probably an enforced abdication al la Styryx). His failure to act quickly is still 
further compounded by his failure to act effectively when he did finally act. He 
should have been able to prove his legitimacy very simply (just transmit the 
approriate authorisation codes and its all over). Strephon failed totally but this 
does not remove his legitimacy.

> there
> was no legitimacy to his acceptance of Norris\'s declaration of
> independence

By this stage all bets are off. The Imperium had de-facto ceased to exist (in 
effect the Moot had voted by its members actions). Strephon as the most 
legitimate surviving Imperial candidate acted responsibly by allowing the sole 
surviving portion of the Empire to act independently.

Avery\'s status is quite clear. As the oldest surviving issue he is the most 
legitimate successor after Strephon\'s death. The only possible disqualifier is 
did Strephon publically acknowledge him?

Irrelvant, without a formal abdication, as long as Strephon lives he is Emperor 
(there is no constitutional provision for removal of a reigning Emperor except for 
Assassination or forced abdication). Therefore his oldest surviving issue (Avery) 
is the most legitimate heir end of story (so long as Strephon publically 
acknowledged him at some point).

One can quite convincingly argue that by thier actions they (the nobles who 
made up the Moot) had effectively voted to desolve the Imperium.

Um, I have to differ though on your synopsis.  These "Travellers" may 
not settle down, marry and have kids, but they probably do frequent 
startowns, lovers in many ports...  Perhaps lots of kids that they don\'t 
know about...

She tried everything, and so, here I am!  I have a brother too...  I

named me "Sue".... :-)

Fealty to the interstellar governors, who are their defenders and aid, is

I believe I\'ve heard of such things. A Viking(?) tradition where you
could be found guilty of murder, but the court would not execute
you. They would simply make it legal for the family of the victim
or their designated agent to kill you. In some cases, the court would
make it legal for anyone to kill you - a form of Outlawing.

With respect to canon Right of Assasination, the limits seemed
pretty clear.

1. The assassin must be a Noble.
2. The Noble must perform the deed with his own hand.
3. The Moot must approve.

Case 1 keeps the riff-raff from lynching the Emperor and claiming they
had a right to do so. It doesn\'t keep them from obtaining a Noble
for a patsy. Of course, if the riff-raff are lynching the Emperor things
are so far down the tubes that it probably doesn\'t matter any more.

Case 2 keeps disgruntled Nobles from sending waves of lackeys
against the Emperor. If you want the Emperor dead, you have to
risk yourself to do it. If you blow it, you probably don\'t survive the
enthusiastic attentions of the Imperial bodyguards. Of course, for
a proper palace coup the Emperor\'s bodyguards should be on
your side anyway...

Case 3 should be the biggest control of the whole affair. You do this
with the support of the Moot, or you get executed for Murder and
High Treason. Just for fun, you may not get to find out just how
supportive the Moot is of you until after you\'ve done the deed.
Maybe you\'ll be lucky, and the late Emperor\'s kid will be so happy
with you for getting him on the throne early that he\'ll give you a pardon.

Maybe your daring plan was orchestrated/ennabled by him from
the beginning...

A somewhat expensive solution is to buy page protectors, and dissasemble
the entire book, put them in the protectors and then into a three ring
binder. I believe you can even get the 5x8 size that the LLB\'s are.

And that was  the  abridged  version!  They  did  have  a  second
gunner, a  female  character,  who  was  in  a  turret  that  was
destroyed.  She survived but lost most of  her  internal  organs.
After she got out of Intensive Care she  had  a  visit  from  her
psychologically-fragile mother and had to explain to her why  she
(the mother) would now never be a grandmother.

Both the engineering NPCs got the hots for the Sensor Officer and
were always harassing him.   One NPC was female, one was male.

One PC is a robot ... and thus has no civil rights.  Some  senior
officers (and some not-so-senior crew) view him/it as equipment.

One PC has a drug addiction problem.

And once the party went to a briefing meeting and, while  waiting
for the Commodore to arrive, had a food  fight  with  the  donuts
supplied (there\'s always fresh coffee and donuts in  IN  briefing
rooms).  Unfortuneatly when the Commodore  entered  the  room  he
caught a cream donut across the face.  That\'s why they always get
the worst equipment!

I\'m going to write this up properly when I get back from Gencon UK.

I would interpret that situation as an initial failure, but saved
by a luck roll or whatever house rules you use.  (Even with  luck
rolls only 2 out of  my  6  players  still  have  their  original
characters!  ... but they seem to enjoy  themselves.)  And  "his"
name was Draal.

Actually, I once drew the deckplans for the type T patrol cruiser. I don\'t have
the FASA product though, so it was completely from scratch.

I have it, though, and it\'s in the same general quality as my \'unofficial\'
Nishemani Corsair deckplans
(available on http://www2.dk-online.dk/users/mark_seemann/traveller.htm ).

Would people be interested if I put it on my traveller pages?

Okay, that _was_ a mistake on my part.  But the players went along with

The terrorists never intended such a disception.  I  was  stunned

  Subject: Piloting

  \'Excuse me, sir. Is this YOUR passive sensor array main collector dish we
  found rolling about in the next crater?\'

  Five sessions, three major crashes. 
  Also a fumbled electronics roll that resulted in a major fire and
  near-electrocution for the comms tech. 
  Shot myself in the foot, too.
  Flew the ship right into an asteroid (a different one) while trying to
  avoid collision with a little asteroid. 

  Does this happen to anyone else?

Yup.  Current non-traveller fantasy game I run, one of the players is
so effectively cursed this way that I gave her PC a curse.  No
mechanic necessary, until they finally found about and removed the
curse (at which point I just turned critical fumbles into successes,
with some unlikely and humorous coincidence behind it).  The players
got a good laugh when they discovered the so-called mechanic for the
curse.

Or the time I played a AD&D game with the fumble rule being "if you
roll a 1, reroll the d20, and if you roll 1-5 something bad happens; 1
on that second roll is of the order break/lose weapon."  I managed to
break a sword and two bowstrings, in a row.

You mention a jinx disad in gurps.  What\'s the mechanic behind it?

I don\'t believe it was ever specified, but as a rule, protection from ionizing
radiation is almost linear in weight, increasing slightly for heavier elements,
which means SD should probably be 40-100% better than lead per unit thickness. 
Most solar radiation is actually relatively low penetration, but high enough
energy to induce high energy secondary radiation -- which is more dangerous for
metals and heavy elements, with comparable penetration to gamma radiation.  A
couple centimeters of SD should be plenty.
The other problem is cosmic rays...which will tend to go right through an
unshielded vehicle (or person) but if they were to hit heavy radiation
shielding will cause a spray of secondary radiation, which is likely to have
immense penetration, and will be dangerous without shielding amounting to a
couple _tons_ per square meter -- high-altitude aircraft still have the
equivalent of a few tons per square meter of shielding, and collect noticeable
radiation doses (which might well be hazardous over the long term).  Providing
the equivalent of earth\'s atmosphere as shielding is probably at least 50
centimeters of superdense....

Well, ionizing radiation tends to fog optical fibers and cause shorts in
semiconductors, so it isn\'t all that great for electronics -- but most likely
anything capable of killing off a large portion of your electronics will kill
the crew as well (minor electronic faults might occur, which is redundant
computers are for).  Energy weapons would be unaffected, laser and meson
communication would be unaffected.  Radar wouldn\'t be terribly happy, IR and
visible light sensors (and lidar) wouldn\'t be much bothered, though again minor
electronic damage might occur, and possible occasional ghost signals caused by
radiation.

nearly twice as much hydrogen in your tanks.  However, Methane (CH4) is
1/4th hydrogen by mass.  It liquifies down below -150C (I think), but I
don\'t know its density in liquid form.  As I figure it, you could crack out

out there have a better chemistry book that tells the density of liquid
Methane?

Well, no. Interruptor gears (to allow machine guns to fire between their
own spinning propellor blades) were a couple of years behind
machine guns on aircraft. Mounting machine guns on the upper
wing of the biplane (so they fired outside the propellor arc) was a 
common workaround, as were metal deflectors on the propellor blades
to knock aside bullets fired between the blades. Even after interruptor
gear was in place, it was not uncommon for it to become misaligned
and give you the joy of shooting yourself down.

Many craft (especially those built in the 20\'s-30\'s) had unpowered turrets
that were effectively ring or pintle mounts. Most of these had no
gearing at all, were just standard machine guns. The bit where
Dr. Jones (Senior) shoots the outmoded observation plane he
and his son are riding in (carving up the tail nicely) in _Last Crusade_
is very accurate. Even the the mid-1940\'s there were three guns
on a B-17 that could shoot the plane down - Radio gunner and both
waist positions. This doesn\'t include all the mounts that were faulty,
poorly maintained, or had the blocks removed (perhaps as part of a
jury-rigged field repair).

The example in question - an outdated Gazelle shooting itself - is
unusual, but not impossible. That production run of Gazelle\'s gun 
turrets probably depended on computer-based safeties instead of
mechanical ones, and there was a glitch or
incompatibility with the program - perhaps the intended "Gazelle
Upper Turret Gunnery Program" had been lost and replaced with an
older, generic gunnery program intended for turrets that _did_ have
mechanical safeguards.

Most military hardware (and probably software) expects you to know
what you are doing, after all.

Rob, I agree!

OvTrav:  Did you here about the barfight in the SilverStar in Startown 
last night?  Seems to Solomani got into a fight over some ancient war...

You shoulda seen it!  It was brutal...  They were kickin and gougin, 
callin each other names.  And the war was fought in the Terran 20th

No.  The effect of a nuclear damper on a blast crater is to \'cook off\'
radioisotopes which are remaining in the crater.  This isn\'t eliminating
_radiation_, it\'s eliminating a _source_ for radiation.

Incidentally, a sufficiently large nuclear damper would turn off a star, which
would (eventually) eliminate it as a radiation source, thus dealing with solar
radiation....I don\'t think that\'s quite what you want, though. ;)

No.  The effect of a nuclear damper on a blast crater is to \'cook off\'
radioisotopes which are remaining in the crater.  This isn\'t eliminating
_radiation_, it\'s eliminating a _source_ for radiation.

It seems to me that one of the problems isn\'t the solar radiation per se,

Couldn\'t you use nuclear dampener technology to nullify or reduce this
effect? Focus the dampener within the hull plates, cutting out the
radiation source of cosmic rays kicking particles off your hull and
through the interior of your ship.

Hello.

Some posts on the weekend regarding Solomani/Vilani cultures touched on 
something I\'ve been wondering about.  Namely how do we explain so many 
Solomani sounding names for systems so far from Terra?

I suppose Regina could have been called something else in the First 
Imperium (I don\'t think Regina is a Vilani word).  Perhaps its name was 
changed during Rule of Man or the foundation of the 3I?

If a lot of system names are relatively new (ie last 1100 years), would 
they only be used by the "Imperial class."

A Traveller and Imperial Nobleman may call a planet X, but if a minor 
race has been there for 5,000 years I can\'t see them referring to their 
home by another name (assuming you view planet\'s inhabitants keeping 
their cultures and not assimilating into a 3I melting pot).

This may suggest that most planets (at least ones with native 
inhabitants dating back to pre-3I) may have two names, a native one and 
an Imperial one.

Of course I realize that twenty years or so ago when  Mr. Miller et al 
created the Regina subsector they did not imagine having to defend 
system names to an international cyber-community two decades later.  
Nevertheless I suppose that\'s the fun of this list.

Looking forward to some opinions,

Induced secondary radiation from solar particles is caused by an interaction
with the electron shells of heavy elements or metals, not a nuclear reaction,
so a nuclear damper won\'t have any detectable effect on this.  Induced
secondary radiation from cosmic rays is either created as above, or by
particles whacking nuclei and causing a large spray of nuclear fragments and
incidental particles -- the energy of this reaction does not come from the
strong nuclear force, it comes from the kinetic energy of the particles, and as
such a nuclear damper won\'t affect it much.

To add to this. I\'m post to a ship witch can shoot it self (temp problem).
The wedge never came with the ship(she is only 2 yr.. old). Still waiting
for the wedge.

Do long-haul trade corporations have bases in your system?
IMTU there are three basic types of worlds:

	Unimportant.  These worlds contribute insignificant amounts
	of goods to the interstellar economy.  These worlds are fun
	adventure sites due to their relative wildness.
	
	Common.  These worlds contribute to the local interstellar
	economy, and act as feeders to the Important worlds.  These
	worlds are good places to find skilled work or skilled workers, 
	for cheap, or to find bargain used equipment in various states
	of disrepair, or to find pirates awaiting that intermittent
	easy-target high-value cargo freighter.

	Important.  These worlds contribute significantly to the
	local interstellar economy, and serve as bases and terminals
	for long-haul trade and travel corporations.  These worlds
	are good places to find high-tech goodies, mercenary tickets,
	assassins, politically-inspired chaos, and Megacorps.

Important worlds are usually on an X-boat route (or its equivalent).

MTU has 2 ways to determine world Importance:

1. The referee can rule a world as "Important" by fiat.

2. The traveller can use a rule-of-thumb.  In general, a world is
   Unimportant if one of these is true:
      the TL can\'t support long-haul trade (0-9)
      the mainworld is poor (Po) or non-industrial (Ni)
      the system is a Red zone.

   Now we can make some checks to see if the world is Important, or
   merely Common.

   Based on my & Jon Buller\'s local-trade rules, I evolved a complex formula 
   using the UWP to determine world importance.  Then I iteratively simplified
   the formula, distilling out what I believe to be the most important
   elements in the system\'s UWP, leaving a simple way to sift lists of
   UWPs.

   The world IS Important if it has at least 3 characteristics
   from the list below.  Otherwise it is Common.

   Trade code [ Ag, Ri, Hi, In, Cp, Cx ]
   Naval base
   Starport A or B

   The more characteristics the system has, the more Important it is,
   with the maximum possible being 5 (I think).  Glisten is a 5.

This very simple rule of thumb yields these 25 worlds in the Spinward Marches:

Vland has 32 Important worlds, and Core has 28.  I think they should
probably have a lot more than the Marches, but I\'ll leave that for
another day and another revision.

Traffic Implication IMTU:

Unimportant worlds may have local trade routes, but typically are
isolationist, backwater, or frontier worlds serviced by tramp freighters... 
depending on the sector and the referee, of course.

Common worlds use the "Rob & Jon" traffic model to determine local
(subsector) traffic through that system.  They lack the incredible
resources of the top 6% of systems, but may still be very well off.

Important worlds use the "Rob & Jon" traffic model to determine local
(subsector) traffic through that system.  To determine sector and
trans-sector traffic through that system, divide distances by 4, or
perhaps use the X-Boat jumproute for distance calculations.  Use these
"shortened" distances as inputs into the traffic model, and use 
"nearby" Important worlds as destinations for the traffic.  The traffic
number generated might be correct for people; however, the cargo volume
should be very high -- say, 25 times the passenger value, in tons.

For example, if long-haul passenger traffic is from 550 to 1600 people 
per week between Regina and Rhylanor, then long-haul cargo traffic would be 
from 14,000 to 40,000 tons per week, implying there are from 16 to 50 
10,000-ton freighters plying the X-Boat lanes between those two worlds.

significant chance of emerging into a flare, so all starship crews would 
get killed about 1 jump out of a hundred. One has to either assume that
(a) there\'s some layer of Magical Radiation Shield Material on the inside of 
the hull, or (b) clever ship design (using fuel as shielding and/or 
machinery) protects the crew and passenger spaces, especially if the ship
is rolled/turned to put the thick bits between the crew and the star (eg
the engines have enough bulk to absorb nearly all the radiation, so one
just makes sure you emerge from jump with your tail pointed at the target
star; design the ship so there\'s enough pointing margin that you can correct
your course to reach the safety of a planet\'s magnetic field.)

(b) still leaves room for making life tough for players with the (very rare)
big flare or when visiting a double star system, but overall, since 
interstellar travel is common, ships must be protected from the sorts of 
flares you get in most inhabited systems.

Crocket:  Chief just called.  Seems there\'s a report of supply over-

Dampers can cause radioactive material to become non-radioactive (though how
they do this without causing said material to emit a HUGE burst of 
radiation is a mystery.) However, they can\'t do anything to block the
actual alpha/beta/gamma/etc. rays that are flying through the air...they 
destroy radioactive material, not absorb radiation. So a damper could only
reduce the effects of a solar flare by damping the source of the radiation - 
the star - which is somewhat impractical.

How they do it without causing non-radioactive materials to become radioactive
is also a mystery, given canon explanation on it (i.e. it strengthens or
weakens the strong nuclear force).  Described behavior is probably more
consistent with adjusting the range of the strong nuclear force, thus adjusting
the chance of tunneling without seriously impacting the total potential energy
of the nucleus.  Alternately, it could be some effect which manipulates the
chance of tunneling occuring, but I think that would have horrible effects on
normal chemistry as well.

As far as it goes, though, is there any reason not to have dampers trigger a
HUGE burst of radiation?  Striker seemed to suggest that it triggered
low-energy decay (which has horrible consequences in terms of energy
conservation, but the generic damper does anyway).  Later things haven\'t really
specified what the effect was, so it might well disable weapons by triggering a
sufficient burst of radiation to cause the fissile material to melt.

"SCREENS

Early space vessels relied on sensors and heavily shielded \'storm rooms\' to
protect the crew against solar flares and other cosmic radiations. The
problem became more acute while setting up the mining colonies in Jupiter\'s
orbit: the radiation belts forced the construction of specially armored
stations, very costly and not all that safe.

With the space emigration boom, a solution was found: why not equip each
station and vessel with a magnetic shield generator similar in effect to
the field surrounding Earth? Power was plentiful, and the new equipment
stopped almost all harmful radiations. It even had two side bonuses; it
stopped the smallest space debris (which could damage a spaceship) and,
more importantly, it reduced the effectiveness of the weapons used against
the vessel.

The screens do not affect the game. They exist soley to explain why humans
can live near a dangerous radiation belt and not start glowing after a few
minutes. They also help explain why a multi-megawatt laser or a
hyper-velocity slug does not vaporize an exo-armor on the spot.

This system is free and should not be confused with the reactive shield
from the Techbook. The magnetic screen will only stop radiations and very
small particles, never weapon fire. At best, it will slow it down. Furture
technical refinements, however, may make the reactive field possible.

A clever gamemaster will use this to his advatage: a colony cylinder is
hard to destroy, but what about destroying the shield generator."

(from Jovian Chronicles (the Mekton source-book, not the later game) p42
ISBN 2-921573-07-5)

I use modifications of this hand-wave in all my SF gaming. It solves an
embarassing problem while introducing all sorts of fun details. The
magnetic field would need to be very powerful to compensate for lack of
depth. Vessels and stations develop their own radiation belts as long as
the field is on. EVA suits powered by a tether can also be shielded. Any of
suits, vessels or stations can be sabotaged in a deliciously insidious
manner. PCs are much more powerful without resorting to personal
battleships.

Also, don\'t forget:  Gazelle\'s are built on government  contract.
Therefore, they are built by the lowest  bidder!  It  could  have
been a design flaw, like the air filters on  the  Suleiman  class
Type-S Scout/Courier.

This is a strange thread.  The Gazelle in question  was  inspired
by a scene in the third Indiana Jones movie  (as  Walter  noted).
It was fun at the time but in retrospect I don\'t buy  it  myself.
I was improvising and made an error.  Now people  are  coming  up
with reasons how this might be so!

Nobody is arguing that Cleon III should have been kept on the
throne; viewing the Moot action as a rebellion, it becomes clear
that the government had lost the consent of the governed, and the
Moot rebellion is a legitimate response with a long precedent,
even if we restrict our view to Solomani history.  But to then
claim that it is the same Imperium is definitely questionable.

By the way, remember that I\'m looking at this as a "strict
constructionist" to some extent, quite frankly with the ulterior
motive of provoking discussion and further analysis (and less
hate-spewing and anti-Americanism).  If it became necessary, I
could come up with arguments to support the legitimacy of almost
any of the pre-Alkhalikoi Emperors.

De jure legitimization occurs when your government enters into
and can enforce the kinds of agreements that only make sense when
dealing with a sovereign government.  Or when another government
that claims hegemony over the same territory you do acknowledges
your hegemony and renounces its own claims.  Once the Senad of
the Sylean Federation accepted Cleon\'s proclaiming the Third
Imperium, it was de jure and de facto legitimate.

Let\'s be careful here; in the context we\'re discussing,
"Constitutional" has to pretty much mean "fundamental/core" and
with an at least implicit requirement that it be more
"change-resistant" than ordinary law.  It may very well be the
only Constitutional document of the Imperium.  Although, like the
U.S. Constitution, it may have a good deal of case law defining
its interpretation.

No, but the Emperors\' List in the old Library Data booklets
(where I got the names and circumstances of ascension of the
Emperors) makes no mention of the "mitigating circumstances" (or
rather, the reasons for disqualification); rather, it calls out
unusual circumstances, implying at least the possibility of some
"irregularity" in the ascension.  Certainly, there are possible
explanations, and in fact, as you mention, Cleon II may have
adopted Artemsus and named him heir - but we don\'t know for sure;
all we know is that Cleon II abdicated in favor of Artemsus -
which leaves things open to question.  (Which makes for good
discussion on the TML, and good politics in Traveller.)

Whoops, you\'re right about Cleon IV.  Substitute Emdiri; the
point otherwise is unchanged.  And your comment thereon is still
perfectly valid, although I question whether using fleet control
to "support" Moot acceptance can _ever_ be legitimate; consider a
roughly equivalent scenario:  "I have discussed this with the
rest of the Armed Forces General Staff; the Army will march on
Washington on my order unless you pass this legislation/
Constitutional Amendment."

Fleet control doesn\'t sound so legitimate any more, does it?

This actually sounds like a GREAT idea for a campaign of some sort.  IMHO.

There\'s actually a canonical sort of hook to hang it on, right in _Vilani and
Vargr_:  the Admegun Rangers, who patrol Vland\'s "vacation/nature reserve"
continent, chock-full of shady import/export magnates relaxing in the sun and

Actually the key word here is dependent.  Children 19 and over are no longer
dependents unless they go to college and even then they lose eligibility at
age 22.  If they have an ailment that makes them stay a dependent past their
19th birthday then they generally are converted to the Medi?(-Care/c-Aide)
program.  That means that only wives of the vets are dependents. Even if
they were 12 in 1945 (the youngest legal age to get married in any state I
believe) they would be 77 years old.  It sounds like 2010 actually isn\'t
that far from an accurate number.  There will of course always be an
exception; one will probably live to be 160 just to prove ME wrong!

You\'re clearly correct about reforms being needed - but I
question whether Norris maybe didn\'t go farther than strictly
necessary in essentially converting to a pure republican model
from an Imperial model.

We have to be careful when we start using the word
"Constitutional".  While communication made exercising direct
day-to-day control problematical, legally, the Emperor of the
Third Imperium, even as late as Strephon, was an absolute ruler,
with no more control over him than Stalin (though certainly with
a better record of benevolence), rather than being a
"Constitutional Monarch" along the lines of the post-Magna-Carta
sovereigns of England.  Remember that according to the Warrant -
the document on which the _entire_ legitimacy of the Imperium
ultimately rests - the Moot has two choices: "Yes, Your Imperial
Majesty" or a very messy version of hara-kiri.

Certainly, there is bad judgement (plenty of it, in fact)
involved, on many sides - but that should not have led to the
collapse (not the Collapse) of the Imperium.

I question whether there was a necessity to make provisions for
removal - and to do so would have absolutely compromised the
absolute power of the Emperor.  Something that Cleon Zhunastu
could not possibly have found acceptable, given his goals.

Regicide has plenty of precedent, as does usurpation, and even
rebellion.  They are all legitimate (but not legal) means of
forcing change.  However, regicide is - with good reason, I think
- - the _least_ common method used.

(As a side note here, Gerald Ford ruled out absolutely the use of
assassination (and therefore regicide) as an instrument of US
foreign policy.  Consider the potential result of response in
kind.)

If the Moot felt it necessary to remove Cleon III (as they did),
they could have "arrested" him quietly (since there was evidently
a lot of support for his removal - there was no Rebellion as
happened in 1116) and run the Imperium "in the name of the
Emperor".  Or, they could have pulled a Runnymede the way the
English barons did with John in 1215 (Terran Common Era date).

And even that\'s not an excuse, as the documented line of
succession was clear.  If Strephon really had concerns about
Varian or Lucan attempting to usurp Iphegenia\'s right, he could
have easily arranged to have them be absent from Capital as long
as necessary after their majority, or even to be "accidentally
killed" (though this is rather extreme, and _very_ unwise if
there is _any_ public knowledge of the internal politics of the
Imperial Family).

Correct analysis, though built on shaky premises - provided that
none of the nobles in question explicitly declare independence.
Once Craig of Daibei, Ishuggi of Vland, and Bzrk of Antares
explicitly declared themselves to not be part of the Imperium,
their legitimacy as regents/proxies is void.  Dulinor would,
under such an analysis, be a murky case, as the problematical
"right of assassination" enters the picture.  Margaret and Norris
are both on the firmest legal ground - but that doesn\'t mean that
the legal ground is firm in an absolute sense.

Yes.  But Lucan may very well have known about the ceremonial
clones, and _not_ known that the real Strephon was off Capital at
the time.  Ignoring the question of whether he murdered Varian,
he properly claimed the Throne, and legitimately raised the
question of whether the real Strephon was in fact real - it
_could_ have been one of the clones - perhaps standing in for
Strephon as the ceremonial Marquis of Usdiki - claiming to be
Strephon (it wasn\'t - but we didn\'t know that at the time).

No doubt - but in this case, responsibility and legality aren\'t
the same thing.  And as far as voting through actions, that\'s not
legitimate - it was the "créme de la créme" of the Moot-eligible
nobles that acted; the lower-level Moot-eligible nobles may very
well have been drowned out in the storm.  And the Warrant is
specific; it requires an absolute majority of all Imperial nobles
eligible to sit in Moot, not just those who are present at the
time of the vote.  That vote never happened.

But it\'s not clear, since we _don\'t_know_ whether Lucan is alive!
A living Lucan, if acknowledged (and he was), has priority over
Avery.  By 1200, it\'s really not an issue, except as I pointed
out in the analysis of the Regency - but at the time the Arrival
Vengeance took custody of Avery, it was a wide-open question.

Nope.  Avery was not his oldest surviving and acknowledged issue;
Lucan was.  Even if he _was_ a usurper.

Again, consider the requirement for an absolute majority.  In the
case of the Regency Reforms, one can argue that only the nobility
of the Regency must Moot to dissolve, as hegemony over the
remainder has been withdrawn - but Norris would still have needed
an absolute majority of that set to complete the reforms.

Regina wasn\'t settled until the mid-400s, well into the Third Imperium, so
that one is explained easily.  For the others, Solomani officers early in
the 2I period probably account for that ("I\'m the new Commander of
Zarguus.. Zaragusi.. err..  Star Lane Subsector!)

This happens on Earth, witness the Falkland/Malvenas Island dispute between
England and Aregentina.

Norse courts generally didn\'t execute judgements simply because they had
no executing body (Before the kings, Iceland is classic in this regard.).
(As a sidenote, the norse courts did not have the the death penalty as
such before christianity. (And our southern neighbours called our
forefathers barbarians, tsktsktsk. (Oops, sorry, didn\'t mean to make a
political statement. No flamewar, please. ;) ))) The Norse courts are very
interesting, but I\'m starting to drift off topic.

My understanding is they strengthen the weak (?) nuclear forces and prevent
decay.  However, this would mean the material would only be non-radioactive
while in the damper field.  Afterwards the would just resume decaying normally.

You could, if you have someplace to put the energy and radiation released, turn
them around to make a material non-radioactive by making it decay faster until
it is cold.

Someone who is more knowledgeable on the details of the settling of the

Not necessarily.

No problem, really. All official documents, and a lot of other sources
refer to the planet by its imperial name. In surprisingly few generations
I would guess youngsters would refer to their home planet by its imperial
name. This would have highest possibility of holding true if it was status
attached to the Imperium, which it generally has. Lots of real world
examples of this kind of mechanism. Also, changing a planet\'s name could
be a symbolic act upon membership in the Imperium. I see no problem with
the planet keeping its culture, _and_ still viewing the original name as
archaic.

As pointed out, not necessarily.

Hhhhmmm, you have a point.  Did they also tell you that the average life
expectancy after military retirement (20 year, not disability retirement) is
10.3 years.  BTW, I\'m at 8 years and 11 months.  Did they mention that
almost 85% leave the military after 20 years with a 20% or more disability.
Mine is no one\'s business but my own.  Not even my wife knows.

There are a few other things that they don\'t mention that seems to have been
forgotten, time away from your family.  Unlike the Commander-In-Chief, I
don\'t believe in cheating on my wife so I had to endure severe cases of
"blue balls" from time to time (please pardon my language, I just couldn\'t
come up with a nicer way to say it).  When assigned to "hard ship" tours
(family can\'t come) you lived by yourself with AFN for radio and TV (if you
were lucky) and if you drank you could always go down to the "club" and get
sloshed every night.  Oh BTW, that left me out, I quit drinking alcohol in
1980 because I was warned that if I continued that my liver would move out.
This wasn\'t because I was an alcoholic, just something I picked up on one of
my little jaunts "overseas".

 I won\'t detail this with why I spent 175+ days in the hospital recovering
from various assorted and sundry things like; objects being removed from my
body; 21 fractured bones (11 vertebrae) from 12 separate incidents; a couple
of diseases I can\'t even spell right today and more.   I am however, due to
receive a new knee in the next three years paid for by my military
retirement.  Oh, another minor little thing which isn\'t too bad, I can never
give blood or donate organs, that is until medical science comes up with a
better filtering system.

Is it for everyone, NO!  Would I do it again, absolutely!!  Did I know what
I was getting myself into, pretty much after my first hitch.  Was I doing it
for the benefits and the pay, doesn\'t even deserve an answer.

P.S.
I looked into one of those Government jobs that you mentioned.  I would be
working for over $40,000 a year less than I make now in the civilian
industry.  Makes you want to ask what would I have been making for 16 of
those 20 years I was in the Army don\'t it.  If I had left the military back
in 1973 then I would probably be making close to double what I make today.

	I\'m away from my references right now, but IIRC it\'s not just ANYBODY who
can assassinate a sitting emperor and become the new emperor. Usually it\'s
got to be somebody who can already make the claim stick anyway (by force of
arms, support among the Moot, however ...). "Right of Assassination" is
just some fig leaf to cover the fact that he/she got away with a coup.

	Nuclear dampers affect the SOURCE of the radiation--the atom which is
either decaying (fission) or being merged with another atom (fusion). It
doesn\'t affect the actual radiation itself.

	Thus, in order to remove the lingering radiation effects from a blast
site, it is either speeding up the reactions (causing the radioactive items
in the area to hurry up and finish emitting) or somehow stabilizing them so
they don\'t emit. But it won\'t do anything to radiation that\'s already
"passing through."

    Study harder.  Communism lost.  The only places it\'s still taken
seriously is Peking, Havana, and Cambridge, MA.  :-)

Ob-Trav:  According to my T4 book, there is a draft (pag 21).  It doth state:
"A character becomes subject to the draft if 1) If he failes to pass every
enlistment roll, 2) if his enlistment roll is ever a 12 exactly, 3) he
volunteers for the draft."

It goes on to say:
"Unlike enlistees, draftees are not eligible for commission as an officer
during their first term in service.  They become eligible during their
second and subsequent terms if they reenlist."

That is for *Imperial* military service.  Local (sub-sector, planetary,
local Grand-Dutchy) forces probably cover the gambit.

    It  probably also had something to do with the fact the protests

Not terribly great. LH2 is *so* cold that everything but helium is

Well, actually, I\'d say that your pointing isn\'t that accurate when
leaving jump. But it doesn\'t really matter, because it doesn\'t take
*that* long to swing the ship to point the right way.

This *will* cause delays.

As I recall, LH2 isn\'t half bad at shielding from high energy protons,
which are the main rad hazard in flares.

This post caused me to think for a moment and then grab FFS 2. Once I
installed Electrostatic Armor on a ship design and someone asked me why I
would bother, since it\'s cost was more that the equivalant armor in
superdense or some such. Now, reading the discription, ESA provides about
half protection against kinetic energy type weapons KEAP, but full armor
value against "HE, HEAP and *plasma/fusion* attacks".

Could this be construed as radiation sheilds? Since it uses an EM burst for
effect it seems to react in much the way Gordon describes from Jovian
Chronicles. The only problem I see is the delay between when the penetration
of the field is detected and when the burst can be activated. Also, would
the duration of an ESA last long enough for the radiation to pass by?

What do you all think, is this a viable alternative?

As I see it there would now be a reason to install ESA. Then there may be a
roll to determine how much radiation gets through before they are activated,
with damage in ratio to that amount.

Obviously Black Globes are the ultimate answer, but in MTU they are very
very rare, Ancient artifacts (based from the LBB discription) and have only
been seen on a FEW 3I Fleet flagships, and kept, basically as a secret, at
that!

No, it doesn\'t. The damper removes the *source* of the radiation
(contamination be radioactive isotopes) in the crater. With the solar
flare, the *source* is an AU or so away. What you are getting is the
equivalent of a poorly focused particle beam.

We\'ve assumed that you can also weaken the weak force to increase decay
rates.

For the "cleaning up the crater" scenario, there\'s no real problem. The
radiations are all short range. And the energy release will (at a
distance) be nothing but heat. So you increase the decay rate until the
crater is "simmering" at a dull red heat. Nothing nearby will be
appreciably damaged (not after the initial blast!), and the heat won\'t
last all that long.

At a guess, I\'d say a day or two. Maybe a week. 

For missiles, you could suppress decay, and then when the explosive
charge goes off, no fission would occur. Alas, once out of damper
range, the warhead *would* explode (though with nowhere near the yeild).

Alternatively, you can increase the decay rate, and the fissionable
will melt or even explode from the ebnergy release. This will scatter
pieces of warhead all over the place. But it\'s probably the better
choice if you can do it at a decent range.

Nope. The secondary radiation doesn\'t really involve the weak force.
The particles in the nucleus aren\'t decaying. Instead they are getting
*physically* knocked loose.

Actually, it\'d result in *more* radiation than you want to deal with.
You see, if you stop the reactions, the core of the star will collapse.
You won\'t get an average star to supernova this way, but it\'ll be a
mess. Likewise, if you leave the damper on until the star finishes
collapsing, you\'ll get an even *worse* blast when you turn it off (and
all that overly compressed hydrogen gets to react).

Yep. Most folks don\'t realize that originally "Outlaw" meant someone
who had been declared as being "outside the law" and as such anyone
encountering them was free to do anything they wish to them. Kill
them, enslave them, whatever. And the law would ignore it.

Outlawry was a *nasty* punishment. Also very sparing of resources. It
meant that even peasants or serfs could carry out the sentence and
possibly even get a reward for it. And they usually got to keep
anything the outlaw had had with him.

I wonder if the Imperium ever uses Outlawry? 

If they do, picture the scene. You spot an outlaw, shoot him, and when
the police check and find that he is indeed an outlaw, they give you
directions to the Ministry where you can collect the bounty. And they
also give you a ticket for disturbing the peace. :-)

Actually, I\'m told that the first plane to mount a machine gun *didn\'t*
have such. After the gunner perforated a lot of the plane, they
equipped it with such safeguards before the next flight!

Basically, I did!  Since the weapons were all created up and  the
\'transfer\' took place near the PC\'s ship (which  was  armed)  the
terrorists behaved themselves initially.  Once safely  away  they
sent the PCs a \'care package\'  ...  a  booby-trapped  bomb.  This
trap was spotted right away and the PCs took it into  their  hold
and successfully defused it.  (I still don\'t understand why  they
didn\'t defuse it _outside_ the ship, just in  case.)  After  that
the PCs went after the terrorists, who were now fully armed  with
the weapons supplied to them.

I haven\'t seen this chart before,  it  looks  useful.  Are  there
others?  Actually, the NPC who attempted to skim  the  gas  giant
had Ship\'s Boat 2 ... which fits the chart.

"Starport/Planetfall" is overflowing with charts of this sort - Andrew even
admitted to me that he\'d gotten a bit carried away with tables when writing
the supplement - personally though, I think he did a great job and struck a
good balance.

Yeah, I heard the same. Apparently the mechanical device to allow the German
pilots to fire the machine gun through the propellers of their aircraft
wasn\'t invented until some unlucky chap(s) blew the propeller to sawdust...
I wonder how they tested the mounting in the first place?

uhh.. It is a very old clause from "Danske Lov" (transl: Danish Law). it
could happen, but it would have to be put to a vote by the local lords at a
yearly (or bi-yearly??) "Tinge" (sort of a very big market, where legal
affairs were also handled) -the effects are as described, but before the
vote, it would be subject to vengeance to kill or otherwise harm the
miscreant.

They had something similar in all the nordic countries at the time.

Danske Lov is still legal, AFAIK

I believe the idea of firing a machinegun through propellers came from 
the French, initially.  The inventor (Raymond Salnier) thought about it 
while looking at fan...  He borrowed a machinegun from the military, but 
because of malfunctions, etc., the military lost interest following 
outbreak of the war.  Roland Garros had him put steel deflectors on his 
prop.  He shot down 5 German aircraft in a short time...two weeks or so, 
and then was himself shot down.  His aircraft fell into enemy hands and 
his technology was transferred to the German airforce...and Anthony 
Fokker.  Fokker improved the design and developed the 
syncronization...leading to the "Fokker Scourge" when Fokkers with twin 
Spandau machineguns could shoot anything with impunity.  The allies 
developed matching technology and balanced the "playing field" again.

ObTrav:  What is the latest "leading edge" technology that will turn the 
tide of battle in the Imperium?  We know about the Terrans and their 
development of higher jump capability, but what is currently being 
developed to change the face of Interstellar Wars?

Or rather there should be a task system that makes this for you ie at each
skill level there should be a specific task level that is impossible to
fail.
CORPS handles such things fairly well but then argues against its own rules
on this point regarding really high skill levels and shots to the head.

similarly to what we did with the centuries systems on earth.

It\'s a weird result that I\'m not inclined to believe. The original 
press release claimed something about "negative resistance", which
makes me thing they have just failed to temperature-control their
apparatus and discovered the thermocouple.

This made me think of the discussion we had recently regarding why the
Imperium is so slow to develop new technologies. Mostly people brought up
the issue that the Vilani are so culturally slow-moving people. But it
occurs to me that all the sub-races within imperial borders are not
necessarily the same way.

What happens when some world in the Imperium takes the current technology
and has a real knack for risk-taking research and groundbreaking
innovation? They start improving on the current designs faster than anyone
else. Their culture values change and newness, so they integrate the new
developments into their society very quickly, where they are thoroughly
tested, refined, improved, and redeveloped into even better systems.

Does the Imperium value this world, or fear it? What happens to the
markets for goods from other worlds when this world begins exporting
quality, reliable, high-tech goods to its neighbors? Does the Imperium
have an interest in maintaining a "balance of trade" between worlds?

What if some world in the Imperium managed to rise naturally to tech level
G, or higher? What kind of power would such a world have?

What about neutrons, you get a lot of those too and they\'re much harder to
stop (I\'d say any ship with a decent PP output can stop most charged
particle radiation easily)

I don\'t recall neutrons being that big a factor in solar radiation, but in any
case hydrogen is an excellent shielding material against neutrons -- it strips
them of about half their kinetic energy per collision, and has a respectable
chance of absorbing them (and forming deuterium) which gets rid of the neutron
entirely.  It actually isn\'t very good at stopping ionizing radiation, its main
advantage there is that any induced secondary radiation tends to be low energy
(and thus easy to shield against), and charged particles have extremely poor
penetration to begin with.

Of course, this neglects the fact that _empty_ fuel tanks don\'t shield against
radiation at all.

Hm...actually, I was aware of that (and in any case, nothing will happen very

Hmmm... seems to me that El Gigante del Norte (Phoenix) has been averaging
about 10 degrees warmer than Tucson lately.  Are you implying Hell is a
cold and icy place?

Ob. Trav. ->  The Rebellion era certainly implies that there are distinct
cultural divisions in the Imperium beyond the planetary and race level.
How would Imperial Regionalism affect the Imperial Navy in staffing its
fleets and Marine units.  The Rebellion sourcebook sort of implies regional
staffing of such units made it easier for Dulinor to gain control of the
Ilelish fleet, but this same factor does not seem to have prevented Lucan
from drawing in most of the rest of the Imperial forces.

Ah, but Terry, \'ditch\' means an attempt at a *controlled* crash.

I\'ve always seen it as speeding up the reactions; stablization would imply
an effect lingering after you turn the damper off, which doesn\'t make
sense to me.  I would imagine that combat engineers *hate* nuke decon
jobs...while you\'re \'cooking off\' the radioactive elements in the crater,
the radiation environment is going to be absolutely hellish.  Nothing that
can\'t be dealt with using proper procedures, of course, but still not the
sort of thing that makes for a comfortable feeling, given the consequences
of screwing anything up.

IIRC I saw a program on the discovery channel which was on the development
of aircraft. They showed how this system was tested - the aircraft just has
the engine running (either below take-off speed or with chocks in position).
The machine gun is then fired and any interrupting gear can be safely tested
(unless you happen  be downrange and get hit by a falling bullet.

  In the event, all we had to do to make them play dead was ask them nicely
(although bankrupting an already backward and nearly impoverished economy
didn\'t hurt) :>

  In addition to being exceedingly uncooperative when not treated respectfully
(OTOH they did cough up Austria) they never really positively modified their
behaviour when criticized, but tended to react negatively instead.

  Given some of the ways that Trav is played (i.e. TCS, PE) then the players
may run into various states (interstellar or not) that may be inordinately
touchy or downright irrational about being taken seriously (at various times
in the last two centuries most significant states in the modern system have
fit that description). Whether as Admirals or merchants, PC\'s can be made to
regret gratuitously insensitive comments or gestures. Of course, if they
didn\'t behave stupidly they wouldn\'t be nearly as much fun, now would they?

Black Globes are a good example - as people figure out their uses
(particularly their advantages for stealth and for quick retreats) warfare
will become even more dominated by hit-and-run, and fixed installations
nearly undefendable. (There was some MT/TNE example of this kind of thinking
involving a plan to preposition high-jump capability raider cruisers with
black globes, a whonking great spinal mount, and no other weapons - I can\'t
remember the name.)

Tactical FTL through psionics is probably another thing that could at least
somewhat alter the balance of power...

(Tactical FTL comm, I mean - using a small ship with a telepath to relay
targeting info to a large ship to overcome lightspeed lag and hit an
evading target at long range.)

I would say that like here in Arizona, there are regional divisions... 
Like people from Phoenix & Tucson may fight, but don\'t let someone from
outsiz Arizona step in...  I would have to say it would be the same thing
in the 3I...  A cruiser may have mostly people from the same place crewing
it...  This makes for greater crew integrity...

RSDS abbreviates several steps from the QSDS and provides a 
quick way to whip up bare-bones TL-12 starships.  Supports
up to 50,000 ton ship designs (I need that for my ongoing
traffic studies).

T4ResourceGen generates:
	1. random characters (10 at a time)
	2. random adventure hooks (5 at a time)
	3. random ship\'s lockers (3 at a time)

I will be fine-tuning these scripts in the future, so please
send me lists and suggestions.  I really appreciate it.

P.S. These scripts should be on my page by this evening.

Folks, if the list is choosing to avoid saying and hearing unflattering things
about the USA and various forms of capitalist economies, it seems to me the
the minimally adult thing to do is not then turn around and make digs about
_other_ political and economic systems.  

Goading a minority of listmembers when you\'re secure in the knowledge that the
bulk of the list will rally to drown them out and chuckle fraternally at your
own bon mots is childish.  It\'s unworthy of members of the virtual Moot ;)

Actually Leonard you are partially correct on the kids (see my previous

	Sorry, this wasn\'t intended as a goad or a continuation of the flame
war--something I very carefully sat out of, having strongly-held opinions

    'body' => 'Looking over all the (generally off-topic) politico-military posts over
the past few days, an on-topic thought occurred to me:

Historically, on this planet, most colonies/settlements have been
established for economic or military reasons.  Some, however (Deseret,
for instance), were intended as Utopias, a place where those who had the
same goals and ideals could build a more perfect society, unhampered by
those who disagreed.  It stands to reason that at least some planets
were settled for similar reasons during the Rule of Man (I would think
that most Vilani would be resistant to any Utopian movement).  Others
may have been settled during the Third Imperium.

Given this premise, there are any number of curveballs a referee can
deliver to players in a recontact situation (especially Milieu 0 or
TNE):

  1.  Take any socio-politico-economic theory, exaggerate an aspect of
it, and transplant it to [fill-in-the-blank] world.  Give the players
the original basis of the colony [for instance, the main world of
[f-i-t-b] is named Rand, after the noted author/philosopher of Terra\'s
mid-20th century (old style).]  Ensure that the players have access to
the inspirational work(s) in question (_Atlas Shrugged_ for Rand).  Let
them figure out what kind of society might evolve over x-hundred years,
given that inspiration.

  2.  Once they\'ve had a chance to research and brainstorm, allow them
to make contact (planetfall or commo).  They might find:

      a.  The society has made a going concern of its colony, while
remaining true to the Utopian roots (_highly_ unlikely, since Utopian
movements tend to have a prescriptive, rather than descriptive, view of
human behavior ["people should", rather than "pepole do"]);

      b.  The society has moved entirely away from its roots, but still
pays lip-service to the original founders/thinkers (current example: 
just how many folks in here believe that either Marx or Jefferson would
recognize the societies built in their names?)

      c.  The society has split into various factions, each claiming to
be the "True" followers of the ideal that inspired the colony.

      d.  Following whatever tangent, the descendants of the original
colonists have decided that the original founding philosophy was in
error, and have gone off on their own path.

A referee should be able to use this to generate all sorts of
interesting societies (read:  deeply unpleasant situations) to challenge
both the resourcefulness and the preconceptions of the players.

    'body' => '>Has anyone given any thought to what exactly the software on ships does?

IMTU, most "computers" are sealed units dedicated to a specific function,
like a battlefield computer or starship jump computer. This is why
characters don\'t have to make computer rolls to do things like fire a gun
or fly their ship. All electronic devices past TL 10 are able to operate
themselves without external computer control, which is why you don\'t need
special pilot, navigation, gunnery, engineering, cargo, life-support,
medical, financial, and so on ad infinitum computer software. This also
explains why the first computer hit doesn\'t disable your ship.

There are general-purpose computers and specialized software IMTU, but they
change the standard operation of existing subsystems or provide new
functionality. This gives the game interesting new features without having
to backfit computer rules in existing designs, and rationalizes the lack of
computer rules in existing design and combat rules.

>Or what should be available?  What I have is very much specific to my
>campaign, but it seems that this is an area that could use some attention.

I agree. The lack of rules for software is a shortcoming in much of the
recent Traveller material. Two of the players in my campaign are
professional programmers and one of the main things their characters do
during those long weeks in jump is develop new computer programs.

I have been using some ad-hoc computer rules to handle this. One of these
days I\'ll quantify the rulings and post them.

I agree with the proposed descriptions of standard software, with one
exception.

>ANTI-HIJACK
>Anti-Hijack is used to augment shipboard security against possible hostile
>takeover.

Ah yes, the infamous anti-hijack program, in my experience the most abused
software in the game. I remember back in high school arguing with a GM that
had the anti-hijack program able to virtually take over the entire ship.
This was long before Virus.

>In its basic form it provides:
>- - Access control to critical portions of the ship.  A basic installation
>would consist of a keypad on critical areas requiring a PIN for access.
>More advanced installations could consist of a card reader, hand- or
>finger- print scanner, retina scanner, DNA scanner, voice or ultimately
>optical recognition.

Remember that Anti-Hijack is a computer program. Software. It does not
allow the computer to grow new hardware that is not already installed. A
computer must already be able to identify authorized users in order to
function, and things like control consoles, airlocks, and weapon lockers
had better already have security hardware in place to prevent unauthorized
use or vandalism. IMHO, things like this are standard construction and not
part of a separate computer program.

>- - Pattern matching - comparing crew/passenger actions against hijack
>profiles.

I agree, depending on what is meant by "hijack profiles". Being able to do
things like identify and target hijackers among other passengers is a "Hard
AI" problem. Trained professionals, like police officers and secret service
agents, make mistakes in doing this, and a computer program able to predict
future behavior from casual observation would revolutionize civilization.

>In its more advanced forms, the following upgrades are available:
>- - Addition of lethal and non-lethal defense systems to the interior of the
>ship.
>- - Automated release of lethal and non-lethal defensive measures when
>specific threshholds are exceeded.

Let me get this straight; you are installing weapons specifically designed
to *kill the ship\'s occupants*? Wow, hijackers must love this one... You
don a filter suit, do something to trigger the anti-hijack program, and the
ship obligingly gasses the entire crew. Cute. Or are there separate defense
and control systems for different areas of the ship? Since by necessity
data paths for these systems must be spread throughout the ship, you just
need to hack into communications to kill the captain, gas engineering, and
hold passengers for ransom. You might even be able to do it remotely...
Virus for real!

I imagine this is a hit with travel agencies too. "Yes, for passenger
safety and convenience, Oberlindes Lines ships are rigged to kill you as
soon as anything goes wrong!" Hey, maybe the showers could dispense poison
gas (*Smack* oww...).

Seriously, most legal systems ban lethal traps on the principle that life
is more important than property. And "automated defensive measures" are
already banned by the Shudusham Concord and illegal in the Third Imperium.

IMTU, such defense systems are found only in bad holovids.

Interesting idea but, again, not software.

I don\'t want to be a wet blanket, but with players who are computer
professionals this kind of stuff came up early in my campaign. The way I
handle computer programs is with a list of "features", which are available
depending on the tech level, level of automation, and subsystems (like
MFDs, jump drives, weapon batteries, et al) connected to the computer. I do
have anti-hijack programs in my campaign. Features I have defined already
for this program are:

TL 8: Logs the time and user of all changes made to connected subsystems.
It will override a forbidden command, optionally explaining the reason or
confirming the command to mislead the user. "Forbidden" commands can be
pre-programmed or changed by authorized users, but typically include things
like overloading the power plant, colliding with other objects, leaving a
flight path during takeoff or landing, firing weapons or opening hatches in
Jump, jumping to a Red Zoned system, firing at targets identified as
"friendly", rapidly changing internal gravity, shutting off life support,
or studying the effects of high explosives on internal ship structures.
Characters in command positions may un-forbid commands.

TL 8, communications subsystem (ie. the software is running on a computer
that can communicate with the outside world): With access to crew records
or passenger manifest, will contact system networks and search for arrest
warrants or criminal records of all ship occupants and warn command crew
(except crew with such a warrant or record). Will also warn command crew
immediately when any other anti-hijact feature is triggered.

TL 10, communications: The software monitors all public broadcasts and
public areas in the ship (and private ones, if legally allowed) for events
matching predefined threat patterns. These patterns include people saying
things like "hijack the ship" or "kill the captain", carrying weapons, or
sounds like alarms or weapon fire. Professional criminals can usually avoid
being caught this way by disguising weapons and using code words. It can
match visual scans of occupants against crew records or a passenger
manifest to identify possible impostors. It will also monitor for sounds or
movement in supposedly unoccupied areas, like access ways or cargo holds.

An important thing to remember is that an invitation to dinner by a Vilani

I\'ve never found this a convincing argument, because the Solomani were
never more advanced than the 3rd Imperium, despite having (until the rim
war) the highest population and TL sector of the Imperium (the Solomani
Rim). If slow advancement was merely an artifact of the Imperium\'s cultural
background the Confederation (and its earlier forebears) with their Terran
cultural ancestors would\'ve been the polity with the technological edge,
not the Imperium, and the Rim War would\'ve quite possibly have ended very
differently (let alone the \'Rebellion\').

Unless I missed something, nobody\'s mentioned DGP\'s SOM (Starship
Operator\'s Manual).  The centerfold (heh, heh) is a large 11"x25" set of
deck plans for the famous Beowulf-class Free Trader.  They are done in the
traditional "white on blue" method, similar to the way *real* blueprints
are made.  Unfortunately, this makes the deck plans rather difficult to
photocopy without producing ugly results.

  Greater crew integrity is only a good thing if the society they come from
is loyal to the state/regime/corporation/herd/whatever. If there\'s a question
about that then a mixed crew (& officer corps) is preferable, as although
they may not be overly enthusiastic in service it will be much tougher to
arrange for the entire vessel to defect; at worst a cadre of mutineers will
be stuck with a badly damaged or under-crewed vessel.

  OTOH, the Imperium really muffed many aspects of internal political 
policing; perhaps the fall of the Empire can be dated from the reversal
of the repressive policies indicated in Adventure 1? :)

Obviously NOT! The rules mechanics (CT, MT, T4) include a chance of being
drafted.

IMTU, if a citizen is not gainfully employed by 1 imperial year after
attaining majority (by the established criteria for his species as per the
IISS standards), he or she or it may be drafted. I mechanic this by
allowing two different attempts to enlist in services of choice,
sequentially, not simultaneously, plus up to 2 attempts to enroll in
acadamies or college, and the  enlistments may be swapped for additional
college/acadamy attempts; no more than one attempt may be made to any
service or acadamy; if all of these options are failed, the draft must be
submitted to.

Also IMTU, draft results for Army, Sailor, and Flyer are Planetary. Scouts
are Imperial. Navy and Marines are variable; I allow player choice, but if
a player wants to roll here\'s the procedure: 2d6, DM + (Total of all DM\'s
for promotion, position, enlistment, and survival), DM+2 if HiSt tech, DM+1
if AvSt Tech, DM-2 if EaSt tech
	<=9: system navy
	10-11: subsector Navy
	12: Sector Navy*
	>=13: Imperial Navy
* some persons do not use sector naval forces other than the imperial ones.
I assume the more pupoulous sectors have some sector naval forces. In the
Marches, a 12 gets you imperial instead.

Rationale of MTU\'s Naval and Marine Draft:
The Imperial Navy supports the draft because it allows them to pick the
best and brightest from it\'s member worlds.assuming that one in 100 goes
into one of the 18 MT/CT careers, counting draftees, that still winds up
with some huge numbers imperium-wide. I actually assume the 18 careers
account for nearly 40% of all employed persons in one form or another. (The
rest being in things like farming and maufacture, that don\'t lend
themselves to Traveller\'s skill lists). So the Imperial Navy takes
volunteers, and takes the cream of the misapplied individuals.

For Example: Joe wants to play a scout. Joe fails the enlistment for the
scouts, so he applies to the scout acadamy, and fails that. Next he rolls
for Merchant acadamy, failing that too. So he tries to go merchant, fails
that. Now he must submit to the draft or take a job as a farmer or base
level laborer... not to his adventuring tastes. He submits, and just
happens to be sucked into the Marines (probably objecting loudly). WHen he
checks, he finds a total DM of +5 (totalling up the various DM\'s from the
Career Table). He is obviously a good fit for what they want (Max DM Total
is +7 under MT, IIRC), and rolling a 7, the Imperial Navy recruiter at the
local draft office grabs his chit, and ships him off to Marine basic. His
brother, almost identical att wise, has no clue, and submits to the draft
right off, also being drafted to the maries. Fred\'s roll is a 2, so he has
a totla roll of 9 (He obviously did poorly on the aptitude tests due to an
acute bunch of apathy), and the local space marines get stuck with him.

Gee, you\'ve never lived in any of the american colonies (Alaska, Hawaii,
possibly also Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, American Samoa), where
cultural imperialism is supporting massive corporate bodies, and making it
hard for small concerns to get by. And WJ Clinton sure seems like a
warmongering Sex-Addict from here. While alaska and hawaii are states,
Alaska is definitely more of a colony. All the population centers of note
invlolve government centers or military fortifications. Government is the
number 3 industry (Oil and Tourism are the first two). No heavy industry,
and almost no light industry. And, of late, the feds just took away our
fisheries and game management.

It wasn\'t any better in Roman times, so don\'t complain!

The Legionaries served 25-6 years with the colours (usually joining at around 18
AFAIR), making them in their mid 40\'s when they retired. ISTR that the average
life expectancy of soldiers, Legionaries especially, was around 10 years more
than for their wives and children ... they were expensive to train, so the
Romans provided the best possible medical care for them.

They, too, did not do well after retirement, and ISTR that they mostly got
around 10 years extra.

Of course, for some senior officers (senior Centurions, holders of the
Primipilate, Camp Prefects, or those who managed to get a series of commands
over the Auxilia) could be still "in the harness" at age 70 plus.

>There are a few other things that they don\'t mention that seems to have been

Also nothing new. The Romans didn\'t even allow you to get married, officially,
while you were in the army ... and this meant that your children were bastards
unless you legitimised them *after* you retired. This was important for
Legionaries posted in out of the way places who cohabited with local women,
women who were not Roman Citizens ... the children inherited the citizenship of
the mother.

Yes, the downside ... but at least you get free medical care (when Congress
passes enough appropriations for it to filter down to you, I guess, from what I
understand of the reality of the VA these days ... or at least as it is
presented in "Proceedings" from time to time)! Of course, arguably, you wouldn\'t
have *needed* such care if you hadn\'t been in the military! Still, a not
inconsiderable benefit in a country with (effectively) no free medical care such
as the US. Even in Oz, veterans get much better "free" care than, say, I would
(if I didn\'t pay for medical insurance extra).

But a lot do. Especially in the technical areas, I guess. Especially those who
see it as a way to get an education on the GI Bill rather than as a career.

Ex-Legionaries got a *very* good deal ... for a start, they were literate in a
society where literacy wasn\'t universal. They filled important (and well paid)
jobs as part of the Officia of Governors, Procurators and even in local
Municipal Councils (in the Provinces, at least). Pay for such positions was
often better than they would have gained in the Legions ... though things like
Medical Care would not have been included, for example.

While I agree with everything that you are saying, I think I need to make one
thing plain that *may* not have been ... I was talking about the *Imperial*
military. And High Tech Imperial society ... a lot of the problems you are
suffering from will be less of a problem (or no problem at all) for vets of the
Imperial military (though there will, undoubtedly, be new ones).

As a "for example" ... because of the lack of off-Terra disease, there is little
chance, I would guess, that most Imperial soldiers would be exposed to something
really exotic and nasty as you were!

P.S. The tax free salary *was* important to me! As a struggling Uni student on a
pittance of a Teacher\'s Scholarship (A$36 a *fortnight* in 1973 for example, as
compared to a Private\'s tax free A$90 a *week*).

It was also an interesting experience ... but not one I really wanted to
continue beyond the two years. Anyway, teaching High School probably has some
similarities!

One thing I have thought would contribute to the slow increase in tech
levels would be that many of the scientists/engineers move to low tech
planets to earn thier "fame".  The added paper work that the Vilani
culture imposesdrives these people to areas where the paper work,
testing, etc are limited.  Those who would become scientists may become
explorers on low tech/ newly discovered worlds.  Those who would become
engineers may decide to open manufacturing plants on lower tech worlds
to avoid the paperwork/liability requirements of high tech worlds. ( I,
as an engineer am more interested in building things than liability
limiting paperwork and excessive testing)  IMTU the Vilani culture which
was carried into the Imperium culture requires idiot-proofing the design
before it can be sold.  Excessive testing and revision before a profit
can be obtained.  This will limit technological advance.

It was a wild ride. That brings up a question for the list. In said
crash, when we impacted the water, it sent my co-pilot crashing
through the view window in front. I certainly can accept that in the
game but how tough would those things have to be for structural

A possible scenario:

You discover that the local pirate has an ex-Gazelle upper turret fitted.
So you figure that as he is about to board, there will be a point where
the turret can\'t track but you could fire and disable the turret.
Unless of course they have removed the Gazelle safeties...

Alternatively, you have the ex-Gazelle turret and as you track your target
it safeties suddenly go "sorry you can\'t fire there because if this was a
Gazelle there would be something in the way"

IMTU: IN Depots (not other IN bases) completely own  and  control
the system they are in.  Any \'civilian\' population represents the
non-military support services for the depot, its  personnel,  and
its personnel\'s families.  As such, any civilian government is  a
"capitive government" of the IN,  and  thus  subservient  to  it.
That\'s not to say that the civilian government doesn\'t  have  any
input into non-military decisions.

IN Bases, on the other  hand,  only  control  the  base  grounds.
Basically an IN base lies beyond the exterality  line  (like  the
starport).  Usually there is a high degree of cooperation between
the base commander and the local government over such matters  as
juridictional access to the startown by MPs, etc.

IISS Bases (of all types) also only control the base grounds  and
legally lie beyond the exterality line.  And while there are less
local powers for an IISS base commander  there  is  more  contact
between IISS personnel and the local  government.  The  IISS  can
offer greater local  services  to  the  local  governemnt  (local
surveys, interplanetary search and rescue, assistence with  major
trade agreements, library services, etc).

Test? 

You have to realize that the first few armed planes were a matter of
pilots doing this on their own. Strictly improvised.

For example, they started out as observation only. Then a pilot on one
side got POed at one on the other side and took a rifle up with him.
Things escalated from there.

You don\'t get neutrons in flares. For one thing, free neutrons decay in
something like 13 minutes. So they wouldn\'t last long enough to get
there (it takes 20 or 30 minutes for the particles to arrive). Also,
the particles in the flares are accelerated by the star\'s magnetic
field. That doesn\'t do much for neutrons.

Given the *range* of dampers, you can be out of the hazard area. But
the fun jobs are things like flagging the hazard perimeter and taking
periodic readings of the output of the crater so you can tell how far
along things are. 

Other "fun" problems are if you let the heat generation get high enough
for the rock to soften or flow. 

And if ground or surface water is involved, it\'s a *real* pain. You
have to build a coffer dam, pump the water out thru a damper treatment
unit, then dry things carefully. You see, steam might carry
radioactives out of range...

This would have a major impact on the Imperium.  If the Zhos became 
"unbeatable" for a while, kind of like the time period of the Fokker 
Scourge I mentioned, due to their psi-targetting and psi-comm, the 3I 
would need to either rethink (sorry) the use/acceptance of psi or 
develop something that would defend against such a system.  

Just how quickly does the list think that the 3I could get a few psi 
talkers into positions in the fleet?  How would the Navy\'s use of psi 
affect the 3I general public?  Make psi acceptable again?

If he was a Virushi, maybe.  No, I don\'t  think  so.  Given  that
the window of the Space Shuttle was nearly penetrated by a  paint
flake less than the size of a postage stamp ... I would say  that
any Traveller spacecraft viewport would have to have  a  strength
equal  to  that  of  an  unarmoured  ship  hull.  If  I  remember
correctly (I don\'t have the materials with me) that is equivalent
to 33.6 cm of steel.  So your co-pilot would burst on the  window
like a water mellon before he\'d go through it!

I don\'t have my books around here, so I don\'t know.  Changing a tech 
level requires the ability to maintain or manufacture things in the 
local economy.  Going from a B to C would mean that the world is now 
capable of doing C-type things locally.  And this would not be too hard, 
in that there is a lot of C-F stuff in the Imperium.

What would it take for a world to officially reach TL G?  What would 
their capabilities be?

Then, what are the barriers that have stopped the tech development?

Realize (as previously posted) that we are talking about Vilani culture 
as the reason for slow increases.  The Darrians, K\'Kree, Vargr, Zho\'s, 
Solomani, ?, etc., don\'t share that culture, as previously pointed out.  
There must be tech barriers that are holding up development.  We should 
identify those.  Those barriers would represent the area in which the 
scientists would be doing research.  The frontiers of what we HAVE been 
able to do, but can\'t duplicate, can\'t do safely, etc are what I have in 
mind.

Some areas are possible, but taboo.  Like cloning, I think.  Because it 
goes against the grain, is against religion, still isn\'t stable for 
sophonts (even after all these years) whatever.  Higher jump capability 
comes to mind (and we\'ve discussed that).  Misjumps take ships up to 36 
parsecs away, but we can\'t control it, and it\'s too expensive to really 
tackle (unless you are the Imperial Research Federation with a gazillion 
credits, whose budget is being cut because of ......).  Research 
continues into J7, disposable fuel tanks, misjumps, jump sickness, 
higher g maneuver drives, g-compensators.  But for some reason, the best 
minds in the galaxy can\'t break through. 

Adventure Hook:  A scientist on planet Fitb A666666-F (f-i-t-b stolen 
from another poster) has a breakthrough in XX.  A patron, working on 2XX 
discovered that while reading an obscure journal from a subsector over, 
and the information is a bit stale (2 years or so).  He thinks it will 
be the breakthrough that he needs to provide the control to the process 
he\'s spent his 30 year career working towards.  He wants you to go meet 
the scientist and try to get all his data so that he can apply it to his 
process.  Problem is (choice) 1) the scientist is dead, 2) the world is 
red/amber zoned, 3) he couldn\'t duplicate it after all, 4) he knows of 
your patron but hates him for stealing some of his ideas 25 years 
before, 5) the government sealed his work for (unknown security 
reasons), 6) YOUR government (captive) won\'t allow the research to be 
imported....  Etc.

If we could identify the barriers that we think are holding up advances 
in various areas...could make for good adventures to push the envelope 
on technology development...

Has the tech list done this?

Hmmm ... remember that the orders issued  in  800  to  close  the
Psionic Institutes were secretly recinded on two  occasions?  The
Imperium already uses Psi in limited cases.  If assigning a long-
range telepath to each fleet admiral were  practical  they  would
have done it by now.  I  also  seem  to  remember  that  Research
Station Gamma in the Spinward Marches was researching long  range
psi communications.  Perhaps long-range telepaths  are  extremely
rare, or maybe they are prone to spoofing by enemy telepaths.  In
any case if this were  possible,  the  IN  could  do  it  without
informing the general public.

someone finds a bug. I really should sack my quality assurance staff...but
since my QA staff is the same as my developement staff (and that would be

Version 3.1 is now available. It fixes one minor bug - but I\'m striving to
make this as bug free as possible, so here we go...

The bug deals with Contra Grav use on missile design sequence #1. It was
using some figures from missile design sequence #2 for some reason :P

As usual, the spreadsheet can be found:

http://www.ames.net/igor/traveller

in the File List section. OR, if you go into the site itself, it can be
found in the Operations section.

Thank you, and my apologies. I\'ll go do that flogging now...

> The precedent is unfortunate, but that\'s Imperial Law.

I don\'t think it actually evolved quite like that. I more see the evolution of RoA 
as having evolved more like this:

1 - In 245 the members of the Moot meet and decide to remove a loony from
    the throne. Now this is _not_ strictly necessary. Under the Warrant of
    Restoration (WoR) the Emperor can only be removed from the position of
    Emperor by death or abdication; however nothing in the WoR gives the
    Emperor either a) immunity from the law, or b) the right to murder members
    of the Moot. Therefore the Moot could have simply had arrested Cleon III for
    murder and let the law take its course. Now the Moot choose not to do that,
    instead they choose to have Cleon assassinated. Now given that the Moot
    would most likely include the odd constitutional lawyer this had to have been
    a deliberate choice. Why? because it so firmly establishes that the Moot
    may remove an unfit Emperor, thereby avoiding this situation in the future (or
    so its hoped).
    Now with the Emperor removed the question arises as to who will succeed
    him. The way I see things happening is that someone in the Moot said "Hey
    Porifia had the balls to knock the bugger off, I bags she gets to be Emperor"
    (or words to that effect) and the rests of the Moot decided fair enough, she
    took the risk of the assassination (showing great courage, honour etc.) so
    she\'d make a good Empress. NOTE at this point the RoA does not exist,
    its simply that Porifia\'s actions have swayed the Moot into electing her.

2 - Some time down the track (612) the Civil War is raging and George is
    looking through his copy of "The succession crisis of 245" (Langor, Duriim
    and Hankl, Sylean University Press 311) and notes the events. Then George
    assassinates Nicoli and claims he has acted for the good of the Imperium
    just as Porifia did; and claims the throne by "Right of Assassination" citing
    245 as his precedent. Of course the Moot do not accept this and George
    meets a sticky end in 613. But more Imperial candidates claim this
    supposed right and in 619 the Moot accepts Catherine as Empress on the
    basis of RoA. Right at that moment the Right of Assassination comes into
    being as a legitimate means of Imperial succession and nothing short of a
    written amendment to the Imperium\'s constitution can change it. Now this is
    actually a simple thing, but nobody ever gets round to it. Then in 1116
    Dulinor revives the RoA and the Imperium comes apart.

  Gee, Kenji, you\'re beginning to look like a backslider - remember the
official line is that we\'re not dead, just pining, at least until this
Virus thing is over with...

  Besides, it\'s not like the US has very closely resembled their own
theoretical capitalist model very closely at all since at least the
Second World War.

Depends.  On colonised planets, maybe 2 or 3, of which Galanglic would be the 
most common if the colony was Imperial.  On worlds with a native minor race, 
you could get donzens or hundreds, depending on the TL the planet was at when 
contacted.

But what about the proxies.  With Capital being so far away, the 
MT IE explains that most of the Imperium\'s nobles have given their
votes to proxies.  Could the "créme de la créme" have held an overall 
majority?

One hand, they\'dve been standing for going on 4000 years.  Other hand, 3700 
years of probable intermittant maintanance.  Gripping hand, if there was 
enough to make off of them through tourism, the sites themselves at least

Oops.  You are, of course, correct.  I guess I should brush up on my 
Spinward Marches history.

After posting my question I noticed that CT Book 6 "Scouts" mentions the 
Regina system in detail, explaining that all the planets around the far 
companion star were named for distinguished Vilani writers.

I suppose the Vilani strain of Imperial colonialism is there if you look 
for it.

Poetic license.  He was slated to die by the dice during the landing, so I 
thought it would look *cool* if he hit the viewport and took it out.  
Remember, you guys hit at over 300 km/hr.  I calc\'ed it out at better than 100 
meters/sec, so the decel would have been 10G or more.  The chair he was 
strapped into increased the total weight to over 150 kilos, and it didn\'t slow 
down very much when it broke loose.  150 kilos moving at 100 m/s is a LOT of 
kinetic energy.  Thus, through the viewport like a straw in a hurricane.

BTW, your guy broke at least a rib in the landing.  <grin>

Living in San Francisco has given me an interesting view on multi-lingual
cultures and names.  SF has quite a collection of different linguistic
groups, from the expected English and Spanish, to Italian, Chinese,
Russian, and oddities like Hmong.  In different areas of the city, you\'ll
find entire blocks with nary an English language sign in sight.  Two of the
more notable examples are "Coso de Cristibol Colombo" (Columbus street
where it runs through the heavily-Italian area of North Beach), and
Chinatown, where the street signs are in English and Chinese, as is the
menu at McDonalds.

As for naming, we had quite a controversy when the Board of Supervisors
decided to rename Army St. after labor activist Ceaser Chavez.  The street
runs through several different neighborhoods, and there was the usual SF
activism both for and against the measure, split straight down ethnic lines.

I could imagine where the naming/renaming of systems during the early 2I
would cause intense problems, especially for the tradition-bound Vilani.
On the other hand, the Solomani seemed more likely to colonize marginal
worlds, giving more opportunities for "native" naming without offending
Vilani sensibilities.

I wasn\'t suggesting it as something that would make them unbeatable - just
something that would create tactical surprise until the Imperium figures it
out, and help the Zhondani overcome the big TL-15 vs TL-14 disadvantage.
Once the imperium figures out what\'s going on, they can start targeting
the (close) spotter ships early in a battle; taking full advantage of 
psi-spotting requires very careful Zho tactics (could be an interesting
Battle Rider or BL scenario. THe rule would be that an[By time a Zho 
ship fires, use the average of the range from it to its target and the
closest Zho ship to that target for the -1DM/3 hexes modifier. Tactically
what one should do is use a small hard-to-hit 6G ship close to the enemy 
while your big warship stays farther away.)

In Travellers\' Digest 13, when the characters visit Earth, it has changed
considerably.  The average temp. is warmer resulting in a 15 meter increase
in sea level.  Many 20th century era cities now look like Holland with
seawalls preventing submergeance.  One illustration by W.H. Keith shows the
New York Historical Museum (old Long Island that was once domed over due to
pollution), with the Statue of Liberty still there.  A lot of the plot of
the adventure revolves around the Pyramids of Giza (where a hidden Psionics
Institute is located within more tunnels in the big pyramid that were later
discovered with the help of densitometers).  The Eiffel Tower is still
around as well as the ruins of Machu Picchu.  A lot of old sites are
protected and maintained by the Terran Historical Administration.

Well the Regency sourcebook states that Vincennes has a significant amount
of TL17 technology in prototype form and it is imminent to becoming an
official TL 17 world. I think the main reason so many worlds seem to stop or
at least slow down greatly at TL 15 is probably due to cost - it states in
the sourcebook resources were used to bring worlds up to that level rather
than having a few TL 16 or 17 worlds while most are left behind.
Unfortunately I couldn\'t find the page but I do vaguely remember seeing
something in the sourcebook about the regency not going for TL16 because of
the difficulties of maintaining a large fleet of mixed TL 15 and TL 16
ships. I would suspect the current Darrien Patrol Cruisers are kept at
artificially low numbers to ensure the two TL16 worlds in the regency have
no problems maintaining those ships. I would expect the next stage of the
regencys industrial development plans would be to raise the 6 worlds who
tried to be come TL 16 instead of Mora to TL 16 and allow Vincennes to raise
to TL 17 (thus providing them with the opportunity to work out the best way
to raise other worlds to TL 17). Once they have about 8 TL 16 worlds they
would probably be able to start turning out the maintenance facilities
required to maintain a TL 16 fleet.

These are just the sorts of things I was imagining would make this a hard,
annoying, avoid-if-possible job.  Not to mention the fun of doing the
walk-around-the crater final survey for \'hot spots\' missed due to (say)
poor damper geometry...I\'m sure there are just *loads* of volunteers for
that duty.  (And yes, you could use robots, but where\'s the evil GM glee
in that?)

provincial to megacosmopolitan.  

Provincial towns, states, systems, and clusters which represent one 
cultural group would only have 3 languages... Galanglic, Vilani, and 
whatever their language is (which is likely to derive from a Vilani, 
Zhodani, Darrian, or Terran variant for humans).

Cosmopolitan regions will have representations from all neighboring
cultural groups, including their religions, languages, and politics.

Assuming a few interstellar languages originate per sourceworld, and a 
few variants each for world clusters, you could still be up against 
thousands of distinct languages, with a beautiful language tree
branching out wide and dialects abounding.  The Long Night may be
sufficient to give every world its own set of languages, even if
there were only "official" languages (Galanglic and "Vilani").

But then, the longer an official state language dominates the less
hold local languages will have on their population.  Core, then, having
thousands of years of interstellar trade -- and especially Sylea --
would tend to have Trade Vilani (and perhaps Galanglic later) used as 
native tongues.  Same with Vland.  Other sectors of the 1st Imperium
would probably have cultural regions, blurred by the Imperium, with
a handful of surviving languages each which would flourish and entrench
during the Long Night.  The Solomani Rim would be a hodgepodge of 100
Terran languages and dialects, mutually unintelligible, and Galanglic
may be prominent and even official, but I really doubt everyone there
knows it or cares to.

So, to sum up:
	1st Imperium Sectors: 
		Trade Vilani				80%
		Galanglic				80%
		0-10 languages per subsector or so	25%

	Solomani Sphere: 
		Galanglic				50%
		100-1000 Terran dialects		90%
		Trade Vilani				25%

	3rd Imperium "new" Sectors: 
		Galanglic				90%
		Trade Vilani				40%
		0-10 languages per world or region.	50%

I dunno... do these percentages look okay?

It\'ll depend a *lot* on the world\'s history. 

A world settled by a relative homogenous group and not subject to
massive immigration will have whatever language that group spoke
(possibly with greater or lesser linguistic shift if it\'s been settled
for a long time) and a smattering of whatever recent immigrants speak. 

If they\'ve gotten later batches of immigrants from a group that tends
to maintain its own culture independent of the culture they are (Jews
being the classic example) then you\'ll find that language too, though
it may only be used inside the group.

If the original settlement was mixed or there have been large waves of
immigrants you could have several languages.

I\'d say some will be there, some won\'t. Consider that the "Seven
Wonders" of the Ancient World were all tourist attractions (really!)
yet only two or three of them still exist (and of those two are in
ruins). 

The one that still exists, in something like the original state is the
Great Pyramid. It\'d take a *close* nuke to damage it noticeably!

BTW, it must have *really* been something a few thousand years back.
Back then not only were all the limestone facing stones in place
(giving it a smooth surface), but they were still white and polished.
(the surving facing, up near the top, has been sandblasted for
thousands of years and has a lot of dirt embedded in the pores of the
stone). When they were relatively new the sunlight must have been
blinding at some times of day!

My vote for the *least* likely to survive goes to the Eiffel Tower and
the Statue of Liberty. They are both large metal structures exposed to
the elements. The Kremlin is stone & brickwork, and those last. The
Whitehouse is stone and wood, also materials with a long track record. :-)

Eeep!  I goofed!  The Warrant don\'t say _squat_ about the size of
the majority or quorum, or whether proxies are valid.  I seem to
remember some other discussion that suggested that this was the
case - but I don\'t have it in canon anywhere that I can easily
lay my hands on.

And that, coupled with this, makes the whole thing a whole
\'nuther ball game.  Except that we have _no_ indication that a
vote ever took place, thus putting us right back in the same old
game.

Actually, I think the main barrier is a fundamental part of the
background. Once you spread beyond a single system, communication
between researchers takes longer. Rate of increase *is* directly
proportional to the rate at which info travels between different
scientists.  And it seems to be a "rule" that the higher the TL, the
more people it takes working on something to achieve a breaktrough.

Given the size of the Imperium, we have a lot of people. But how many
of them are researchers at TL-F? And how long does it take for info
about new results to circulate? 

There\'s going to be a *lot* of duplication of effort, simply because
Researcher A doesn\'t know that Researcher B tried the same thing 4
years ago on the other side of the Imperium. 

And worse yet, Research can be sidetracked for years here on earth
because someone reported a result and it later turns out that they or
on of their grad students "fudged" the results. In the Imperium, when
you add in lag time, it\'d easily be decades or even a century or two
before someone decided to re-do the critical experiment (maybe as a
class assignment, maybe just out of frustration).

And finally, keep in mind that the "easy" stuff gets discovered first.
So *of course* the hard stuff takes longer.

Well, to start with, if the inertial compensators were online, you
wouldn\'t have felt the crash at all! And if they were offline, in a
"typical" ship layout, every time you used the main drive you\'d have
been on a *wall* instead of a deck. (Major gripe of mine)

As for getting thrown thru it, sure it\'s *possible*. But consider that
that window has to be *at least* as strong as a jet fighter\'s canopy
(probably stronger) and he won\'t *survive* being thrown thru it. That\'s
why they added a projection to ejection seats to break the canopy
*before* it could mangle the pilot if the canopy release didn\'t work.

DGP\'s Digest 13 was an Earth special.  The cover shows the Sphinx
and a pyramid surrounded by green grass and tall trees.  The text
inside mentions that New York  was  covered  by  a  dome  due  to
polution, but the problem has now gone and the  dome  has  become
the New York Historical Museum.  The Sahara has  become  a  giant
automated farm called the Sahara Agricultural Project, except for
a small  area  designated  the  Sahara  Desert  Preserve.  Global
warming has melted the ice  caps  and  raised  sea  level  by  15
meters.  A few densely populated areas are protected by sea walls
... these were attacked during the  Imperial  invasion  but  have
since been rebuilt and the water  pumped  out.  There  are  large
underground cities thousands of feet high,  sometimes  projecting
above the surface of the ocean.  Several hundred  thousand  acres
of eastern Australian coast has been purchased by the Hivers  and
is now a Hiver enclave.  The Nile River valley is flooded due  to
increased sea levels but places of special interest like Giza are
protected by sea walls.  An internal  picture  shows  two  people
standing on what I suspect is a sea  wall,  near  the  Statue  of
Liberty (about level with the head), looking across a bay at  the
New York dome (it is transparent).

    'body' => 'My quick blurt about stuff in this thread;

1) With 1000+ years of Long Night, there\'s _ample_ time for a monolingual
Solomani colony to undergo enough linguistic divergence that by M:0 or CT
times it has to be considered a multilingual planet.  Languages change all the
time; they don\'t need "outside influence" to do it, and they can do it real
fast, often for no apparent "reason".  Why?  Not to get all anti-gearish and
luddite on y\'all, but language isn\'t just a tool for transmitting information
bits; it\'s expressive.  People play with it constantly.  Maybe more than they
use it according to the alleged instruction manual.  And look what happens
when people play with power tools?  Tsk, tsk, tsk.  Very messy.

2) By the same token, the idea that Zhodani, Vilani, and all other Ancient-
transplanted human minors are essentially monolingual, or at least don\'t have
the linguistic diversity of Terran humans, is frankly a GREAT BIG STINKING
LOAD OF -- untenability.  300,000 years of linguistic development and change
on Vland will get you exactly as much diversity as 300,000 years of the same
on Terra has produced.  If non-Solomani humans are relatively more monolingual
_nowadays_, a non-linguistic (in the strict sense) explanation should be
found.  Politics and recent history, namely.  The Zhos are mind-raping
fascists; the Vilani are soulless corporate clones who all go around talking
like they live in a managment seminar; the Geonee engineered their language so
it\'s absolutely perfect and efficient, damn your eyes; etc.

3) Non-Anglic-speaking Solomani colonies.  Absolutely!  Besides the speakers
of "major" languages besides English who would\'ve contributed heavily to
colonization efforts, I still advocate the existence of the Confederation
Agency for the Preservation of Representative Indigenous Cultural Expression
(CAPRICE), forcibly airlifting (spacelifing? jumplifting?) endangered minority
language communities to "safe havens" offworld during the dark days of the
Interstellar Wars.  (I also very strongly advocate that this agency be made
responsible for having transported Chomsky\'s frozen head, that priceless
intellectual treasure, to a secret secure storage facility, on Cymbeline.)
Finally, as I think I mentioned before, IMTU the Islands Cluster was
originally settled by different groups advocating one or another artificial
auxiliary language -- Esperanto, Novial, Lojban, Glosa, Interlingua, etc. --
and so Trillion Credit Squadron is merely one more way in which the adaptive
fitness and superiority of these improved, better langauages may be proven.
Because, as we all know, languages and cultures evolve just like organisms,
under the influence of natural selection   :|

4) Multilingualism in the Third Imperium.  IMTU, the Imperium itself (i.e.,
Navy, Scouts, Marines, megacorps, Imperial noble and court business) is
strictly monolingual, in Galanglic.  If you want to Travel(l), you learn
Galanglic; if you want to do business with outsiders on your homeworld, you
pretty much have to do it in Galanglic.  Some of the Vilani-based
megacorporations encourage the use of Vilani, though -- especially at the
senior management levels and above.  Outside of official Imperial and
corporate contexts, though, there _are_ other languages in interstellar use --
mostly Vilani, but maybe other regional (subsector-wide, sector-wide)
vernaculars that interstellar travellers might use to communicate if they
don\'t want to use Galanglic or Vilani.  So for recruits and draftees into the
Imperial services, part of their "first term skill package" is also functional
fluency in Galanglic, if they don\'t know it already.

5) Following along from 4), IMTU all the major interstellar states have
official language policies and in most cases, codified, prescriptive language
norms.  Underlying planet-to-planet linguistic diversity is far greater,
except perhaps in the Aslan Hierate, where cultural and linguistic conformity
is explicitly enforced.  I\'d expect the Hiver Federation to the on the
opposite pole (most quantitative diversity and qualitative vigor), followed
closely by the Imperium.  The Solomani Confederation seems more interested in
making Rim Anglic the standard language of everyday speech, but also created
Firstspeak to ease interstellar communication.  The Vargr regions of space --
all of the above and everything else, reshuffled once a fortnight.

6) Following from 4) and 5), the reliance on electronic translation equipment
IMTU is probably less than in other TUs, maybe including more canonical ones.
Electronic translation is only needed across species boundaries, essentially,
and even then it isn\'t necessary: Vargr and humans can communicate effectively
in each other\'s languages, Aslan and humans as well, but with more difficulty.

IIRC inertial compensators are limited to a specific number of G\'s dependant
on their tech level.  I don\'t think any of them go past 6 G\'s.  In a crash,
you decelerate from hundreds of KPH to zero over the course of the length of
your ship (or the depth of the impact crater).  I think this is significantly
greater than 6 G\'s... At the point that the deceleration exceeds the internal
structure rating of the ship, it crumples up like spagetti... usually this
disables any existing compensation thus aggravating the problem.

Of course, IF your gravitics are working, you would kinda just float there
wouldn\'t you?

Some ships are designed to have the decks perpendicular to the primary
thrust.  Broadswords are like that and IIRC so is the Azanti.  Ships that
AREN\'T designed that way have a different reasoning.  The various trader
ships are intended to land and thus their decks are arranged so that they can
be powered down while on the ground.  Traders also don\'t have very high
accelerations as a general rule, thus the shifting of cargo isn\'t such a
problem even without compensation.

    'body' => 'Here\'s my stab at a chart like the one from the old JTAS that Doug B. just
mentioned.

Notes:
1) My personal feeling is that quantifying linguistic difference is sticky at
best and moronic on the average.  "Percentiles of mutual intelligibility" as
given below should be interpreted as the ref sees fit -- the term has
absolutely no linguistic meaning.

2) The numbers in the chart are mostly meant to be relative to one anothe; add
or subtract points across the board to suit the degree of cohesiveness of YTU.

3) My assumption was that increased interstellar commerce increases exposure
to Galanglic, as does the presence of Imperial installations (presumably
involving more traffic and off-worlders resident in the system). 

4) 100% intelligibility does not mean 100% identity; the speaker and hearer
dialects are still distinct and noticeably different, but fully mutually
comprehensible without preparation.

5) Listeners with more formal education and who are multilingual have an
easier time understanding unfamiliar dialects, because they have more prior
exposure to linguistic difference and are more likely to have developed
(consciously or not) habits of linguistic self-awareness.  

6) This chart compares only the local version of "Galanglic" to the standard
form used by the Imperial institutions in the region.  If a planet is known
(or decided) to be populated by people who don\'t speak a language related to
or based on Galanglic, then mutual intelligibility is zero.  (Unless the
listener happens to know some other language that _is_ related to the local
vernacular, of course.)  

7) "Hearer" refers to the off-worlder/PC who\'s trying to understand what the
shady character/bartender/exotic dancer in the local mudside startown is
saying to him

Obviously, locals need to understand the offworlders too; a hayseed customs
official on a backwater planet might not have the faintest clue what the crew
of the Empress Marava is saying, even if they can understand _him_.

If the hearer is not a fluent speaker of Standard Imperial Galanglic, figure
out what his or her "intelligibility percentage" to S.I.G. is and multiply it
by the local percentage.  For example, Vladimir Smith is a hick from
Bloomfield (B537865-7 S) who speaks Riftian Galanglic with only 85% base
fluency (75% from TL/Starport + 5% from Scout base, plus 5% based on his later
travels and experience).  While waiting in a hotel lobby on Saussure
(B262732-6) between ships, he is approached by a young lady in flowing white
robes.  Saussure\'s local vernacular is 70% intelligible to those fluent in
S.I.G.; Volodya, however, is an unedjicated lout (monolingual, Edu 5: -10%
ability to understand other dialects) and can only understand (0.85 x
0.7)-0.1, or 49.5%, of what she tells him.  Accordingly, he refuses to get
involved in helping her risk his blubber for the sake of napping children, or
whatever the hell the silly wench is talking about.  Apparently she\'s a welder
of some sort, because her friends show up to take her back to the metal
installation, and everything turns out okay.

  That\'s a very interesting theory, but hardly believable. By way of
disproof, merely consider for example the secrecy issue. If you told
me about said conspiracy and I wasn\'t supposed to know about it, then
"they" would have to off me if I believed this tripe, wouldn\'t they?

  Luckily I don\'t believe any of this claptrap, which would in any case
save "them" the trouble of silencing me if they knew (and they always do)
that I knew - but you probably knew that when you told me, right?

Since I joined the TML (oh, three years ago now?), there have been
countless threads on the J-Drive and the pseudo-science behind it.  Rather
than define the physics behind the drive itself, I would like to work on
alternatives on how to use it, and how I use it IMTU.

Let me start with the DMs I use:
Jump Base Roll: 2-
PC interaction:
Successful Navigation roll: -1 *
Successful Engineering roll: -1
Successful Piloting roll: -1
Each missed skill or failure roll: +1
Each spectacular failure: +3
If there was a Spectacular Success and a misjump is rolled, that character
can abort the jump (spotted the condition that causes the misjump and dump
the jump.)

Navigation factors:
Jump Plan:
Generated by shipboard Generate program: +1
Generated by shipboard Generate program w/the aid of a System Book: -2 to
+2
Generated by starport and followed without deviation since last update: -2
Generated by starport, maneuvers made but back on course: -1
Maneuver/Evade active: DM +Evade factor (If Pilot fails task roll)
Sensor Suite:
Running totally blind: +5 
Running passive or degraded (jammed or damaged sensors): +1 *
Commercial/Merchant: 0
Military Standard: -1 *
Scout/Survey: -2 *

Engineering factors:
Ship jumping with 72 hours of previous jump: +1
J-Drive (Discovery TL) driven to max factor: +1
Maintenance (# of jumps since annual maintenance - 20)
if Maintenance < 0 then: DM +0
If Maintenance >0 then: DM (# of Jumps over 20 - Engrng Skill Level of the
most compentant engineer aboard)
Fuel:
Refined: 0
Unrefined: +1

Avionics factors:
Diameters at the time of the jump
On the ground/in the atmosphere: automatic misjump  **
0-5: +10		Task Difficulty: Impossible
6-99: +5		Task Difficulty: Formidable
100-199: 0		Task Difficulty: Average
200-399: -1		Task Difficulty: Average
400-799: -2		Task Difficulty: Easy
> 800: -3		Task Difficulty: Easy

*Does not apply if you are using a Starport generated jump plan or System
Book.
** Roll for jump regardless, if result is 2- ship is destroyed.  Task
Difficulty is Impossible and the DM is +10.

First, let me establish the conventions I use IMTU.  This is not intended
to tout my way as being better than any other way, just to make clear the
assumptions I use in my definition of the Jump process.

JUMP: IMTU
The components of the Jump Drive consists of the power supply, cooling
systems, field generation plant, and control devices that create and
distribute the Jump field.  The Lanthanum Grid, external to the ship,
radiates and shapes the Jump field around the ship.  The Jump Field, to
produce a successful (read that survivable) jump must achieve a extremely
high level of energy initially, which causes the ship to transition into
Jump Sapce.  Then the field strength is permitted to decay until enough of
the energy is successfully bled off into Jump space that the controlled
collapse of the field will result in emergence from Jump Space.  While
enormous amounts of energy are required to make the translation to Jump
Space, the actual energy level on the grid, at any given point, is not
relatively large amount (the key word being relatively).  Much of the
energy is lost in the translation from N-Space to J-Space, and the
remainder is used to create a field around the ship.  When the field
collapses at the end of the jump, that energy must is transmitted back
into the grid and dispersed by the J-Drive.

Because gravitational forces extend into Jump space, the jump field is
very sensitive to gravitational fields in the early and late stages of the
jump.  Trying to form a stable Jump Field deep within a gravity well is
extremely difficult, and can cause a misjump or even catastrophically
collapse the forming Jump Field, overloading the capacity of the Grid and
instantly destroying the ship.  At the destination end of the jump,
however, the gravity well is commonly used to spontaneously precipitate
the ship from Jump Space.  While, in theory, the effect is the same as a
catastrophic collapse, the energy involved that late in the decay of the
field is well within the ability of the grid to handle.

Warning: An extreme gravity field (such as that of a black hole) can
affect a ship even when the field is at its strongest  (in the first 24
hours of the Jump) and can pull a ship out of Jump space by collapsing the
Jump field (the energy backlash would make this a hazardous emergence even
if the proximity to the Black Hole did not).

Once the Jump Drive in engineering has produced the field in the required
frequency, and amplified the power to the desired levels, it is delivered
to the Lanthanum Grid.  Once a powerful enough field is built up around
the ship, it will make the translation to Jump Space.  But creating a
uniform field around the ship only translates the ship into Jump space, it
does not give the ship a vector.  It is the sequence in which various
segments of the Grid are powered up, and to what intensity, that applies
the Jump Vector to the ship - establishes the course through Jump Space.
And finally, when the field begins to collapse, the Jump Drive will absorb
the returning energy and attempt to reshape the field to create normal
space vectors (effectively allowing a ship to appear at rest with respect
to the target planet, even if the originating system had a large relative
velocity) when the ship emerges from Jump Space.  It should be noted that
extremely large vectors (>J-drive factor * .001c) are not possible without
causing damage to the Lanthanum Grid and Jump Drive.

The Jump Field itself has two functions.  One is to facilitate entry into
Jump Space and create a vector for travel, and the other is to maintain a
bubble of pseudo-reality around the ship.  Canon is pretty clear in that
the interaction between Jump Space and our Environment is hazardous to the
extreme.  To prevent this, there is a primary and secondary field
generated from the grid - the Primary Field creates the entry into
Jump-Space and imparts the J-vectors needed to get the ship to the
destination.  The Secondary field is relatively low powered, and is used
to maintain a survivable environment in J-Space.  This bubble consists of
a buffer zone of Hydrogen (H2), created by the controlled release of H2
into the space between the ship and the secondary field.  Any contaminants
introduced into the H2 buffer may cause a slight, uncontrollable change in
the J-Vector of the ship.  

I have broken the components of a Jump into 4 major categories:
  1) PC Intervention - the rolling of the dice, etc...
  2) Navigation, the process of generating the course needed for a
successful jump.  
  3) Engineering, the process of generating the field needed for a
successful jump.
  4) Avionics (not the best term, but it works) - which is basically the
Pilot combining the inputs from Navigation and Engineering to make the
Jump process work.  

PC INTERVENTION
The first step in the Jump process is the Jump plan.  It is pretty simple,
it consists of the destination, the time of departure and the intended
Jump Point.  This is set up prior to any rolling of dice, and once it is
set it is not subject to change without some form of outside influence.
This means that if the PCs set up a Jump Plan for 95 diameters, and
someone fails a roll, they cant decide to run out to 200 diameters to
offset the DM.  Get the idea that this is a process that culminates in the
jump, while it is possible to dump a jump, it will take a spectacular
success roll on the part of a PC to notice something is wrong and abort
the jump.

Currently, the interstellar travel under the Traveller system calls for a
single jump roll.  I always felt that was overly simplistic, and now use
up to 4 - three of which are task rolls from PC/NPC characters acting in
the Pilot, Engineer and Navigator roles.  For each successful task roll, I
allow a -1 DM to the final jump roll.  For each failed task roll, I assign
a +1 DM to the final jump roll.  The task difficulty is determined from
the jump point selected, to reflect the influence that a gravitational
field has on the forming Jump Field.  It should be noted that in my
system, not only does it get progressively more difficult to make jumps as
you progress deeper into a gravity well, but it becomes much easier as you
progress out to the well. (For GMs with detailed system maps, this should
include not only the planets gravity well, but the solar gravity well
too.)  If the Jump Point is within 5 diameters, the task difficulty is
Impossible - this includes jumps from within the atmosphere, although
regardless of the final jump roll, jump originating in an atmosphere will
automatically misjump.  However, if the final Jump Roll is 2-, the ship is
destroyed.  If the Jump Point is from 5 diameters out to 99, the task
difficulty is Formidable.  From 100 out to 199, the task difficulty is
Average.  From 200 out, the task difficulty is Easy.

Where there are not enough crew onboard the ship to fill each critical
skill slot, the missing roll is assumed to be a failure (but not a
Spectacular Failure).   If a PC chooses to try and fulfill more than a
single shipboard role (and that PC must have at least 1 skill level per
role they are trying to fill in order to do so), I allow him to make all
of the die rolls, but he is not able to apply his skill levels to any of
the rolls (simulates him attempting to do two jobs, but not able to
concentrate fully on either.)  

In other words, if Heln (Pilot-3, Engineer-2, Navigation-1) were to act
only as a Pilot, she would be able to apply her full skill level to the
task roll.  If, however, her Engineer jumped ship (due to her penchant for
flying *under* bridges) and she were to take on his duties as well, she
would still be able to roll for the Pilot task and the engineer task, but
she would not be able to apply her skill levels to either roll.  If the
Navigator were to also jump ship, even though she possesses the skill to
set up the jump, she would not be able to attempt to roll for a successful
task resolution, she is not skilled enough to take on the three jobs.  The
Navigation for this jump will have to be set up and run by the automated
systems.

It should be noted that even though using unsupervised automation does not
allow for the same levels of performance that a skilled operator may bring
forth (i.e. a DM of +1), the shortcomings may be overcome in other areas.
If there is no Engineer on your staff, you may offset the DM by not
jumping at the 100 diameter mark, but moving further out to the 200
Diameter mark.  If there is no Navigator, use of a Starport generated Jump
Plan will more than offset that lack.  If there is no Pilot aboard - you
shouldnt be trying to jump!  :) (but I would strongly recommend that you
interface your Maneuver program with the Generate program and hope for the
best.)

The final jump roll should be made by the Captain or Owner of the ship.
This is the jump roll, and should be used to determine success.  A roll
equal to or under the modified Jump Roll indicates a misjump.  In any case
a 2- indicates a misjump.  Normally (as long as there were no exceptional
failures thrown) this would be a failure to initialize the jump field, in
which case a 2-12 hour delay is needed to check systems and reset
controls, after which the jump process can begin anew.  In the cases where
a exceptional failure is thrown, a system failure is indicated, in which
case maintenance of the Jump Drive components associated with the skill
(the J-Drive for engineering, Avionics for Piloting, and Sensors or
Computer for Navigation) is called for - a process that should take 72
hours and is performed by any competent Engineer (skill level 2 or better)
and will cost 3D6 * 1000 credits (I actually double the cost further for
each 6 rolled.)   The one exception allowed to avoid the misjump is if any
of the crew rolls (Engineering, Navigation or Pilot) were exceptional
successes.  In this case, the PC making the roll noted an anomaly in the
process and may, at the PCs option, elect to dump the jump.  In this case,
the Jump drive is never activated, the fuel is never spent.  A new jump
plan will have to be generated, and the process re-initiated from that
point.

NAVIGATION
The effect Navigation has on the Jump process mostly originate from three
factors.  
  1)Where the Jump Plan was originated from.
  2) The Sensor platform used to provide the data for the generation of
the Jump Plan, as well as to maintain course while executing the Plan.
  3) Whether or not any maneuvering, not part of the Jump plan, is
performed.

The Generate program uses system data for computing the Jump plan drawn
from Library Data..  While this is able to generate consistent, mostly
reliable Jump Plans it is limited by the detail of data available from the
Library Data software and augmented by direct input from the ships
sensors.  Navigation data from the Library Data is limited to the area
immediately around the MainWorld, as well as rudimentery information about
the remainder of the system.  Detailed system data must be acquired
separately, either by first hand sensor data, or in the form of a
purchased System Book.

To acquire detailed system data the use of active Scout/Survey sensors are
the most effective means.  Plotting a jump after surveying the system will
allow a DM of -2.  Active military sensors are also designed for this
task, and give a DM of -1.  Active commercial sensors give not advantage,
they are just not sensitive enough to discern the detail necessary to
augment  Jump Plan generation, but do provide the necessary information to
maintain the precise navigation necessary to execute the Jump Plan.  This
cannot compare to the accuracy and detail of the data that is available
from the local Starport, and its constantly updated sensors.  Once we
leave the realm of active sensors, however, we rapidly lose the ability to
gather the data necessary to effectively augment or even correctly execute
the Jump Plan generation.  Attempting to execute a Jump Plan with passive
sensors, or in a heavy sensor jamming environment incurs a DM of +1.
These modifiers can be compensated for using the highly detailed system
data available from a starport generated Jump Plan or System Book,
discussed later in this monograph.  And on the extreme end of the scale,
if for some reason a ship attempts to execute a Jump Plan while running
without sensors incurs a DM of +5.

The Starport can supply a ship with two different forms of assistance.
These would be Jump Plans and System Books.

Class A, B and C starports are able to supply a ship with a pre-generated
Jump Plan.  Most have several different levels of support, the basic being
a plan that is generated on request with a specific start point and time
(usually the starport), requiring specific levels of Thrust, ending with
Jump occurring at a specific jump point at the specified time.  Basic Jump
plans such as these can be had for as little as cr100 at low traffic ports
(Class C), to cr500 at high traffic ports.  A ship travelling under a
pre-generated Jump Plan is generally pre-cleared by the Starport Authority
to lift and exit SPA space in accordance with that Jump Plan.  Generally,
if a variation from the plan is required, or a problem is detected, an
update to the current jump plan can be requested from the SPA for an
additional fee.

The other option are System Books.  These, simply, are specific-use
computers that have detailed data on a system programmed into them.  To
access the data in the System Book, they are plugged into the ships
NavComp via the auxilliary port, and addressed by the NavComp as any other
device.  The data in the System Book is encrypted, and any attemp to
access the data other than via the Navigation program will result in its
erasure.  Generally, System books will come in one of two varieties -
Single Use and Maintained.

A Single Use System Book is obtained from any Class A, B or C starport TL
9+.  It contains the detailed data for the system, but the System book
clock is deliberately mis-timed so as to degrade the value of the data
over a fairly short time.  For the 8 hour period surrounding your target
Jump time, the System Book provides a DM of -2 (same as provided by a
Starport generated Jump Plan).  From 8 hours to 24 hours, it provides a DM
of -1.  From 24 hours to 72 hours, it provides no benefit, but the data is
accurate enough to provide no detriment either.  If a System Book is 72 to
96 hours out (either before or after) its target time, the data provided
will cause a DM of +1 to be incurred, and from 96 to 144 hours a DM of +2.
Past that, the differences in the data supplied from the System Book and
that detectable by sensors will be sufficient to cause the data to be
flagged as corrupted and disregarded.  A system book can be obtained for
cr 1,000, but once obtained for a system it can be reset (and updated) for
cr 500 (same time limits apply).  Additionally, a System Book can be
turned in to a SPA for a cr 300 or credit towards a new System Book for
whatever system the ship may be in.

Maintained System books are very similar to Single Use, with the exception
that the data does not intentionally degrade over time.  These are
intended for ships and/or corporations that do a great deal of business in
the system, and can be expected to need the data for the long term.
Effectively, the data is accurate enough to supply a DM of -2 for one
year, and a DM of -1 for and additional 2 years.  The data will be updated
for free for the first year, and for cr 500 at any time after that.  Cost
is cr 5,000.

The best Jump Plan in the Imperium is useless if the ship does not stick
to it.  If, for any reason, the Pilot elects to override the computer, the
course will be invalidated.  The only exception to this would be if
Maneuver/Evade is operative.  Maneuver/Evade allows the computer to adjust
for Pilot overrides and bring the ship back to course.  However, because
it will be virutally impossible to restore the ship to the exact course
and vectors, a DM of +[Maneuver/Evade factor] is imposed.

ENGINEERING
Successive jumps are hard on people and equipment.  The Lanthinum grid
retains residual energies that must be dissapated either naturally over
time or by some artificial means.  Normally, the grid will have eliminated
enough energy in apprroximately 72 hours as to not affect the next jump.
If it should be necessary to engage the Jump Drive before that time
period, however, you will incur a DM of +1.

Ships that are operating at the extreme energy levels of their drives
and/or grids may not be able to maintain adequate power to both. Because
losing power to the primary grid would cause a catastrophic field
collapse, power may be routed from the secondary grid and cause localized
breeches in the environment field.  While this may be the lesser of two
evils, it is nonetheless extremely hazardous both to the crew and the
ship.  To this end, the environmental field is segmented, with control and
engineering spaces receiving priority power, followed by passenger and
crew spaces, weapon turrets and fuel bunkers, magazine and cargo spaces.

By this, I am describing ships that receive cutting edge J-Drives
(Jump-1/TL-9, Jump-2/TL-B, Jump-3/TL-C, Jump-4/TL-D, Jump-5/TL-E,
Jump-6/TL-F) drives and perform a jump to their maximum capacity  (i.e. a
ship with a TL-14 J-Drive performs a Jump-5.)  To this end, I impose a +1
DM for misjump when using a jump drive built at its originating TL, and
jumping to the maximum factor the drive can sustain.  At the TL+1,
advances in safety, control and power generation nullify this danger.

This does mean that keeping track of the TL of the drive is required, but
since the ship is usually built to a homogenous TL, that information is
usually available already.  Ships receiving upgrades may have to track the
TL of the J-Drive separately, but I do not see this as an onerous burden.

And since we are looking at record keeping, lets examine the maintenance
cycle.  I do not believe that J-Drive maintenance is time related, but
rather it is the use of the J-Drive that stresses it.  After approximately
20 Jumps, the stresses on the drive core and control systems will begin to
show, and while a competent engineer can keep the drive running smoothly
for a while longer, it is time to consider having starport-level
maintenance performed.  

For each Jump past 20, you will incur a DM of +1.  However, you may
subtract from that the skill level of the most competent engineer aboard -
this will not give you a negative DM, if it falls below 0 then you ignore
the result and take a DM of 0.

The use of unrefined fuel does not affect the J-Drive, other than to clog
filters.  However, while H2 released into the Jump Bubble does not affect
the Jump, impurities introduced into the Jump Bubble will cause
uncontrollable variations in the form of the bubble, and also in the
vectors the form creates.  Use of unrefined fuel, thereforre, incurs a DM 
of +1.


This monograph, as with all of my IMTU series, will be posted on my web
site when I return from my road trip.

  There was also a whole bunch about Naval use of psionics in the 
Regency in the RSB. It all struck me as being either terribly 
optimistic or feel-good propaganda; I simply found it unlikely that
the Regency forces could have any significant advantages in overall
psionic capabilities when compared to a large interstellar state that
not only is based on psionics (and has used them for thousands of years)
but also has integral society-wide competitions in those talents.

on the list - the stabilizing effects of permanent media.

The only examples we have of long-term linguistic variation are from
Terra. A planet that, until recently, had limited literacy and no media
for preserving how words were said.

Recall the archaeologist in _Star Gate_ realizing he\'d been
mispronouncing ancient Egyptian all these years...

The Chinese example, a common written language supporting several
verbally incompatible languages: when written language was developed,
it became consistent - it did not stop developing, but the rate of change
slowed. The verbal languages kept evolving, changing at a higher rate.

Now we have audio recordings. I can hear not only what Herbert Hoover
said, I can hear how he said it. If I want to say "Never have so many
owed so much to so few" just like Winston Churchill did, I just have
to listen, right down to the inflections and accents. 

When the Emperor speaks at Capital, the TNS carries a full-audio
recording to every corner of the Imperium within a year or so - just as
he said it.

Once a culture starts speaking Galactic, it will speak the same sort
of Galactic heard on the science tapes, the news holos, 
the entertainment videos. There will be accents and slang terms,
idioms of local color, but the drift will never be far from the galactic
norm as long as the couriers keep stopping by.

IMO the common language of the Imperium has been standardized
throughout the Realm to within a few degrees of whatever they use on
Capital since before the X-Boat links were up.

They were on (failing) battery power when they came in.  The compensators went 
down early, and the batteries weren\'t strong enough to crank the M-drive much, 
just barely gave them some *slight* manuvering thrusters.

The ship was over 70 years old and indifferently maintained for over 5 years.
And no, the co-pilot didn\'t survive his meeting of the minds with the forward
viewport.

ObTrav...  How many people think that comedy from the late 20 th Century

Great theory, but what about the 3I...  I have run them as keeping tech
levels at an artifical level of 15 because if a sector had a TL of 16  they
might beable to fight back vs the 3I...  So the emp. suppressed
technological development...

Works for me..

After the begining of the Civil War, the emp was able to pull out a
butt-load of TL-16 & 17 stuff & won...

 Considering that bridge windows have been a "point of ingress" to derelict
ships in Traveller since the very beginning,we have to assume that they are
easier to breach than, say, the average hull plate. I would expect the actual
window to break well before it popped out if its frame, however...
 Of course, after the crash the local port\'s Flight Cert Mechanic would ground
this
ship for a very long, very expensive repair job. ("You \'popped\' a window?!?
Not \'broke\'.
\'Popped\'? Sonny, your ship has suffered a catastrophic frame failure. You
ain\'t getting to Aramis in THAT ship, not this week or next!"). Of course,
this assumes that the ship isn\'t sitting at the bottom of a very deep ocean
amusing the local fishoids...

 IMTU, the second point would be more important than the first. Even one year
of neglect can run a ship through most of its remaining useful lifespan. Five
years and _someone_ walking away to tell the tale is only for characters too
foolish to be killed off  (In the Amber DRPG they refer to it as "Too much Bad
Stuff
to be allowed to die.").

Lucky bastard. Hint: Starship captains with hair that would give a
centauri (B5) an inferiority complex.

ObTraveller: How about the PCs buying a ship where the contract shows that
some of the crew follows the ship and cannot easily be fired? («Hmmm,
nice, we automatically get some people who know the ship. Perhaps things
are beginning to look better?» Poor schmucks...)

Some megacorp found the planet to be rich in [insert your favourite rare

So has anyone else noticed that prior to his conquest of Egypt a certain

conquering the world game then he did after he conquered Egypt.

MT states [Players Manual pg 97] "Psionic activity cost increases with
range.  Psionic ranges are identical to ranges used in combat.  Psionic
range costs are 1 point per range band (Close is 1; Short is 2;
Planetary is 10; Extreme Orbit is 12).  Psionics has proven incapable of
interplanetary ranges.

[Note that the comment that Psionics has proven incapable of
interplanetary range is contradicted by the point costs given elsewhere
in the text.  Consider the case of a Telepath who has just taken a dose
of Psi Special and has Psi 15.  He attempts to use Life Sense [base cost
1 + Range]  He spends all 15 Psionic points he has and can therefore use
his life sense for 14 Range bands.  14 range bands takes you to the end
of the System Range band (1,000 AU\'s) yet the tables say she could life
sense out to this distance.]

 Psionic activity, at the ranges given is effectively instantaneous and
is not affected by intervening matter in most cases."

Extreme orbit range extends to 5,000,000 km, almost 17 light seconds,
yet the rules [which use 6 second combat rounds] clearly state that it
is effectively instentaneous rather than stating that it is subject to
spped of light lag.  Therefore if _must_ be FTL or the rules would not
call it "effectively instantaneous".  Note also that the rules for task
_duration_ for psionic tasks do not make any mention of task duration
varying with speed of light lag, therefore Psionics must [in MT] indeed
be "effectively instantaneous".

[Alternate view - Whomever wrote this paragraph was not as much of a
rules lawyer as I am, they considered 17 seconds to be effectively
instantateous, and Psionics is subject to spped of light lag]

[On the Gripping Hand - Psionics includes (as a Special in TNE)
Precognition.  Obviously if you can learn about things that have not
even happened yet you are _not_ following speed of light limits,
therefore QED, Psionics is FTL.]

Well the plot most certainly has thickened. If this was Dulinors message, why

Hmmm  ...  this  gives  me  a  thought:  Is  is  possible,  using
different materials and shapes, to  construct  a  room  inside  a
mountain or pyramid or other  structure  ...  that  uses  stealth
techniques to defeat detection by pre-densitometer  scanners?  It
seems to  me  that  the  principles  of  scanning  through  other

think?

So should the guy you are replying to. Regina was settled in 75. It was
independent of the Imperium until 250 where it joined together with 6
other systems in the same cluster.

Interesting. I didn\'t know that (_Scouts_ is one of the books I lack, alas).
Are there any other interesting historical tidbits in _Scouts_?

>for it.

My theory (and it\'s only a theory) is that almost all early Imperial
settlement spinwards of the Vargr-infested Corridor was limited and
driven by commercial interests. Not until the latter half of the 300s
does immigration play a major part. But in addition to Imperially
(actually, megacorporate) settlements there are a number of utopians
(people going far away to build their own vision of the ideal society) and
a lot of exiles driven from the interior by the Pacification Wars (Anti-
imperial settlements, so to speak) that runs the Vargr gauntlet and settles
down in some parts of the Marches.

So Regina is propably settled by a group of utopians (75 is just too early
for Pacification War exiles).

Also in FFS1 (albeit under "Alternate Technologies") the Psi-Drive uses
Clairvoyance and Teleportation at interstellar distances.

However, Psi would hardly be useful in a naval battle.  Canon references to
electromagnetic fields disrupting Psi abilities (especially Telepathy) are
numerous.  Psi shields, the psi jammer from "Expedition to Zhodane", or just

IMTU, this kind of thing is why pirate ships are in such bad shape.
The crew keeps jury-rigging and spot-welding things to keep her
flying long past a scheduled annual maintenance, wearing out
major components until everything gives out at once. Almost
enough to make Scotty cry.

Basically I let a crew do "field expedient annual maintenace" if
they can\'t get to a class A or B starport. While it resets the
counter for misjump malfunctions, it provides a permanent
increase in chance of system failure and puts wear on things
that are expensive to replace. Do too many field expedient
maintenances, and a ship intended to last 40+++ years will wear
out in ten - or five.

Field expedient annual maintenance is also time-consuming,
difficult, somewhat dangerous, and requires a supply of spare
parts. It\'s not for the financially sensible or faint of heart.

Let me put another spin on.
Do you (or does anyone else) think (proxies and all) that enough votes 
are sitting in capital to dissolve the Imperium?  Could citizens wake up 
one day and find the status quo is no more?  Or do you think there would 
be a call for all members of the Moot to come to Capital to cast their 
vote?

Agreed. This is another one of those things, like ships whooshing by in
space, that always irritated me in SF. It seems a holdover from ocean-going
ships and makes absolutely no sense.

>thrust.  Broadswords are like that and IIRC so is the Azanti.

And I always liked those ships for that reason. I had hoped this would
become the standard in Traveller but alas...

So? Why can\'t a ship with decks perpendicular to their thrust land? Why
couldn\'t they be powered down? They would land and take off straight up,
like a helicopter. This would take less parkbay area and not need long
landing strips.

Even an airframe ship can have perpendicular thrust and decks, like a
harrier or VTOL. If, for some reason, you absolutely must land and take off
like a glider you can still mount the main engines in the belly of the ship.

>Traders also don\'t have very high
>accelerations as a general rule, thus the shifting of cargo isn\'t such a
>problem even without compensation.

This would seem to rule out ships with parallel thrust and deck
orientation. Consider that, in order for a ship with such an orientation to
use its main engines to thrust away from the planet it would have to pivot
90 degrees after takeoff. Cargo on the floor will now be hanging off a
wall. This must be the "different reasoning" they are designed with.

With the thrust and decks perpendicular, there need be no shifting at any
acceleration. Even 6 uncompensated gees wouldn\'t budge your cargo an inch
(unless it wasn\'t strong enough to hold together under that acceleration).

  Isn\'t there a tremendous amount of background radiation in space?  IIRC the
rads build up quickly for astronauts.  Thus, wouldn\'t the very nature of space

After a lot of feedback from various TML members and approval from
Marc Miller, I\'ve decided to release (re-release in the case of LOM)
all five of the J. Andrew Keith manuscripts by New Years in what I
hope most will consider a professional format. 

The three larger supplements - "Letter of Marque," "Scams," and
"Faldor" (all originally intended as boxed modules) will be released
as large adventure type supplements, roughly the size/shape/format as
say DGP\'s "Flaming Eye". 

The two smaller supplements, "Planetfall Starport" and "Artic
Environment" will be released in their originally intended LLB (Little
Balck Book) format, like "Duneraiders" for example.

All five J. Andrew Keith supplements will be autographed by Andrew as
well as being fully \'gone over\' (typeset, proofread, etc.), and
(drumroll please) fully *illustrated* with both \'old\' and \'new\' (i.e.
previously unpublished) artwork by William H. Keith. All five
supplements (staying true to the chosen format) will also be folded
and stapled with cardstock covers featuring Bill Keith artwork as
well.

OVERVIEW

Below is a simple description of each supplement:

"Letter of Marque" -  First in the "Rogues in Space" series. Set in
Reaver\'s Deep sector on the fringes of the Imperium, it details
many/most aspects of playing/running pirates in the Traveller
universe.

"Scams" - Second in the "Rogues in Space" series (or, as Andrew wrote
on the manila folder this handwritten manuscript arrived in - "Pigs in
Space"). Also set in Reaver\'s Deep sector, it fully details
playing/running gangsters in the Traveller universe. 

"Faldor - World of Adventure" - Companion module to both "Tarsus" and
"Beltstrike." Set in the District 268 sub-sector of the Spinward
Marches, this supplement fully details a \'lost colony\' world
originally settled by the Darrians. Features several adventures, and
throws additional light on the Darrian, Sword Worlders, Zhodani, and
Imperial intelligence services.

"Starport Planetfall" - Companion supplement to "Startown." Described
by Andrew as "An encounter booklet for Traveller," it details many
aspects of starports and the individuals to be encountered there, as
well as priviously untouched aspects of making planetfall.

"Artic Environment" - Last in the Keith\'s "Extreme Environment"
series. What\'s to say - this supplement explores in-depth the aspects
of surviving on Iceworlds ("Tran-ky-ky" anyone?).

EXTRAS

I am working on several \'extras\' to include with the supplements. They
are:

"Imperial Calendar" - Will feature the \'best\' of Bill Keith\'s
Traveller artwork, and will be autographed by Bill. Large format, 54 pages.
(Only available when purchasing the entire set.)

"Reaver\'s Deep" - Sector supplement featuring: Sector and sub-sector
maps with matching UWP\'s. I am also thinking of including the library
data for this sector, but am not sure yet.

2 Cluebooks - LLB versions of the original loose-leaf and stapled 
cluebooks for both MegaTraveller I & II computer games.

And lastly, the results/winners of the NPC/Starship contest (HINT - I
could use more than two submissions :). Not sure what size/format this
extra will take at the moment - judging by the present results, it
just might end up being a folio. I am thinking of merging this in with the
"Imperial Calendar."

RELEASE DATE

I\'ve set Christmas as my deadline - orders will be shipped on or
before December 31, 1998.

PRE-ORDERS

Except that my daily speech is done with a California accent, and my normal
vocabulary is sprinkled with bit of Spanish.  I could do Sir Winston\'s
speech to Commons, but it would be obvious that I was trying to impersonate
the accent.

Take the American South.  One of the most recognizable accents in the
world.  After living there for a few years I had picked up the accent
(along with the use of "y\'all" in daily speech).  Someone from Missouri
trying to do Churchill will sound very odd to me, since I\'m filtering it
through two different accents; the speakers own, and the one he\'s doing.

For amusement, I watch the Prime Minister\'s Question Time on C-SPAN.  There
are times when I have trouble understanding what some of the members are
saying.  This is a case of a fairly literate son of an Englishman listening
to the (alleged) cream of Great Britain.

They can.  The Broadsword is a classic example.  But Needles and Wedges give you
problems.  A Needle form is six times longer that its width.  That makes it
unstable and likely to fall over in a breeze.  Landing is likewise a problem;
imagine tossing a stick to the ground and hoping it lands perfectly balanced. The
upside to Needles is using it for spinal mounts.

Another inconvenient thing about parallel orientations is that you fly by looking
up. This isn\'t so innate in ground pounders.  Here on Earth, we move around
perpendicular to gravity and we\'re used to it.  In space, suddenly, up is forward
which is disorienting.

I think it all boils down to where the ship will be most of the time.  If its in
space, then save on the artificial gravity and make a parallel orientation.  If it
lands often, then use a perpendicular.  Note that thrusters are not used in jump
space thus grav plates are needed for half the time aboard starships.

I haven\'t seen anything that says how big it is ... analysing the
picture: it goes nowhere near the Statue  of  Liberty,  but  does
cover dozens of  skyscrappers!  I  would  guess  it  covers  just
Manhatten (more or less) ... which is still pretty impressive.

We both stand corrected.

Not really (although I don\'t have the book in front of me).
It uses Terra and Regina as examples of a detailed system description.
It mentions that Regina (a moon orbiting a gas giant orbiting a primary 
and close companion) was named after St. Regina, and the planets 
orbiting the far companion (most or all inhospitable I believe)named for 
the Vilani writers.

All in all they are really more like footnotes in an example than any 
source for cultural information.

As I mentioned, I don\'t have it with me right now.  If I find anything 
else I\'ll pass it along.

This would seem to rule out ships with parallel thrust and deck
orientation. Consider that, in order for a ship with such an orientation to
use its main engines to thrust away from the planet it would have to pivot
90 degrees after takeoff. Cargo on the floor will now be hanging off a
wall. This must be the "different reasoning" they are designed with.

With the thrust and decks perpendicular, there need be no shifting at any
acceleration. Even 6 uncompensated gees wouldn\'t budge your cargo an inch
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.
What\'s happening here is the ships with decks perpendicular to main
engine thrust were designed by people who think of contragrav and
intertial compensators as standard safety features, so reliable that
it\'s OK to have a ship that\'s unusable when they\'re offline.

We\'ve got some examples of assumptions like this today. How many
airliners are equipped with high-altitude emergency escape
capabilities? We\'ve got the technology, but we don\'t see the need.

My impression was not that any random EMF disrupts telepathy but that only
specifically-designed ones of some particular intensity/frequency/etc. do 
so; walking under a power line doesn\'t disrupt telepathy but a psi shield
does.

Still, even if it is susceptible to random interference one could design a 
ship to minimize such interference (I have a vague recollection of a 
"Games Workshop" (or some other british house) zhodani frigate design with a

friendly ships. Should work fine. Maybe an EMP from a close (100 km) detlaser
detonation would briefly interfere, but if a small ship gets hit by a laser
missile that\'s the least of its worries.

That\'s actually because the Egyptians (like the Hebrews) didn\'t write down
the vowels. The scholarly convention is, basically, to always use "a" as
the vowel. This is just for convienence, though, so they don\'t have to try
to juggle collections of consonants in their technical speech. If you note,
in the film when challange about saying he couldn\'t speak it he says "Once
I learned what vowels to use...".

What I use in the various campaigns to simulate only partial understanding
between characters and NPCs is syllables. If they barely know a language I
say they can speak to people only in words on one syllable. If they know
something of it, I let them use up to two syllables. This isn\'t perfect,
they\'ve been able to come up with some rather complex statements using
words of only two syllables, but it suffices for game purposes.

For written material, well I do a number of things. Most often I will use
an odd font, and print the material in that. If they players want to spend
loads of time working out the correct substitution cypher to translate the
message, I\'m happy to assume the characters have spent an equally tedious
time translating it. Otherwise as they get clues, I print bits in
plaintext. Or, if they hire an expert, they may be able to work out some of
the characters (Would you like to buy a vowel?). In another circumstance,
one player had knowledge of a related language so I printed, in clear text,
the first 5 letters of every word (simulating the roots being similar, but
the endings being different).

The infamous \'Talking Head\' of the Templars was obviously recovered not from a
site in the Empty Quarter of Arabia by Hiver archeologists, but from the
glovebox in the Sphinx.  If you listen to songs by the \'80s pop group of the
same name, backwards, you can find independent scientific confirmation of this
fact.

Furthemore, I would like to point out that the alleged "decipherer" of the
Egyptian hieroglyphic script (itself a bastardized version of Hiver (Sign))
was, like most of the French intelligencia of the 18th and 19th centuries, the
merest pawn in an intertemporal Sayat-Vilani struggle.  And _why_ did the
Hiver M. Rosetta arrange for Champollion to receive a personal (Sign)-French
translator module?  Eh?  And why did another cell of French agents arrange for
a pair of giant metal edifices -- one eerily prefiguring the doyenne of the
Empress Wave, the other ominously functional in appearance -- to be erected at
a carefully selected locations on Terra?

But more alarming even than that -- what pressing need did the Templars have
to make them build a dome over Manhattan?  What sinister machinations do they
need to protect in that secretive, mysterious, ancient metropolis?

	Which is why IMTU anything beyond about TL8 or 9 doesn\'t HAVE "bridge

in the center of the ship, the most protected location (b) run sensor
fusion (you\'re not seeing anything that would be visible, it\'s a composite

TNE gives pretty good (IMO) evidence that telepathy (anyway) is not FTL, in
that it says that telepathy is the reading of a mind\'s electromagnetic
patterns. As electromagnetic signals move at lightspeed, I assume that
telepathy will also be at lightspeed. Personally I rule that teleportation
is FTL, because IMTU it sort of \'skims\' Jump space to give a micro jump
that sends scientists wild by violating the jump=1 week rule.

There _are_ probably enough votes sitting in Capital to dissolve
the Imperium - but I expect that you\'d need near-unanimity of the
sitting votes to do it.  That\'s unlikely to happen unless there\'s
a _really_ egregious situation that can\'t be fixed by even
massive tweaking.  However, for a vote of such moment, I would
expect that, even if there were sufficient proxies available, a
call _would_ go out - on something like that, you don\'t want to
assume that the proxies you hold are necessarily going to agree
with your personal opinion.

Er... every writing system on the planet that we can understand represents

This is all possible through audio recording and mass communications, but it
isn\'t made necessary by it.  The situation you propose presupposes that
everyone in the Imperium will _want_ to model their own speech after that of
offworld political/entertainment media figures.  This is IMO a huge and
unwarranted assumption to make.  It represents the general trend we\'ve seen in
the development of modern nation-states, particularly after WWI.  Like you
mention, a particular, historically specific set of related examples.
However, it is not at all the pattern found in many or most "old-fashioned"
patrimonial empires, whether you\'re talking about the Austro-Hungarian or
British empires, imperial China, Romanov Russia, pre-colonial Java, etc.  

In societies with this general type of political structure -- which I see as a
much better model of the Third Imperium than 20th century "nations" --
differential language and dialect use was one of the key elements in
expressing, protecting, and creating class difference.  A peasant in the Pearl
River delta who tried speaking guanhua to his  landlord from the capital
wasn\'t expressing solidarity; he was being insolent.  Petty London clerks and
shopkeepers who tried imitating the accents of the educated classes were
merely getting ideas above their station.  Russian nobility preferred French
over Russian, symbolically separating themselves from their subjects and
affiliating themselves with a culture that was "foreign" from a petty-
bourgeois nationalistic perspective, but more prestigious and suitable from
the perspective of aristocratic power.  Why would Imperial nobles tolerate
silly little provinicials on low-tech mudballs aping their betters?  Much less
advocate this?

On a popular level, in situations where you do have some form of incipient
ethnicism or nationalism, mass media and audio communications often has merely
heightened the sense of difference and separation.  Promulgation of
standardized languages catalyzes awareness of regional distinctiveness; there
has to be some element in addition to mass media per se which overcomes this
and makes people think "we sure don\'t talk like that around here, but really
should" instead of "sheesh, listen to those funny-sounding foreigners squack
on about how we\'re all one family, one nation..."

The technology of mass communications, even just in printed form, reifies
language to a larger degree and to a wider base of people than previously
possible.  People become aware of it as a _thing_.  Things can be manipulated
and changed.  In the last fifty years, we\'ve seen 1) terminology in East and
West Germany drift apart in only a few decades, likewise between the PRC and
Taiwan; 2) the creation of Bahasa Indonesia as the language of public affairs
in post-independence Indonesia, and the intentional separation of it from
Malay which it is originally based on; 3) the continuing effort to separate
Croatian and Serbian languages from one another after the breakup of
Yugoslavia, in the effort to make them into independent, "pure" languages not
so obviously related to one another; 4) revivals and revitalizations of
moribund or completely dead languages and regional speech forms (pick
convenient W. European example of your choice).  The great Ebonics flap from a
few years back was part of this phenomenon: in the face of mass media and
aural communication promulgating a single standard/correct form of the
vernacular, a non-standard form can be counter-promulgated using exactly the
same technology.

This is why I think the 3I is diglossic _at best_, if not thoroughly
multilingual.  Code-switching is a great way of managing multiple layers of
identity and allegiance with a minimum of conflict.  The \'feudal\' political
structure of the Imperium pretty much demands that sort of management, IMO.

But now... now I must go and get packing.  Cambridge MA, and the
Comintern^h^h^h^h^h^h school await me.

One of the things I like least about Traveller starships is that there is no
avenue for upgrading anything but the weapons in the turrets.  I disagree with
it, and have been trying to generate rules for it for a couple of years now.

This section of the software descriptions reflects that belief.  Yes, you can
add new hardware to the ship\'s internal defenses, and then the software must be
upgraded to be able to access the new hardware.  (or vica-versa - I can see
someone buying a A/H package that controls the release of gas, then having to
upgrade the ship\'s hardware to utilize the function.)

I think it makes a lot of sense to have these capabilities in the cargo and
\'tween deck areas.  For some ships, accesses to critical portions of the ship
(outside the hatches to engineering and the bridge, for example) may also be
covered.  I don\'t forsee indiscriminate usage.

Remember, the ship\'s computers are linked into *everything* in every incarnation
of Traveller except TNE - that is the only timeline where the utter dependance
on the AI systems becomes suspect...well, and the Kinuir adventure!  ;)

As I understnad the Concord, automated defenses are not banned, just defenses
where the AI is permitted to decide at what level those defenses are prosecuted
at.  Anti-Hijack uses a decision tree created by a sophont security specialist,
and those areas where lethal force would be used should be clearly marked.

> IMTU, such defense systems are found only in bad holovids.

I\'m afraid I must disagree.  With the Ship\'s Computer able to interface with all
systems, including the floor plates (grav), inertial compensation, and
ultimately, life support, the A/H has a variety of lethal responses that can be
utilized if properly programmed (or worse, improperly programmed.)  If you
primarily operate in a TNE universe, then I can see where this may not apply to
your campaign - but there are legacy starships.

Thats as may be.  But I spun it a different way, in a plot for my players
that never came about.  I had a secret society, naturally, of evil but
powerful people, secretly enslaving psionic sensitive people.  They were
behind the promotion and tolerance of psionics in order to produce a larger
pool of psionically enabled people.  From these, telepaths were given
rigorous and often deadly tests.  For those with the greatest strength and
telepathic aptitude, an unforunate future awaited.  Not death, but something
worse.  The brains of these psionics would be removed from their bodies (and
the bodies destroyed).  All vestiges of personality and memory to be wiped
out.
The brain, however, would be preserved and through the use of experiimental
psi-drugs, bio-cybernetic hardware, etc., the brains would be used as
conduit for FTL communications.  Of course, you need another brain on the
other end.  With psi-strengths radically increased, FLT communications a
parsec in distance could be achieved.  Or at least it was hoped.

I never decided whether the experiments would be successful in any permanent
way, but just that it worked at least a few times, justifying in the minds
of the evil guys, even greater excesses.

I basically stole the germ of this idea from Simon Green\'s Deathstalker
books, in which Psi-Shields are made from the brains of psionicists.  Then I
changed it from psi-shieds to communications.  I suppose you could
extrapolate it to teleportation as well.  But I didn\'t think my evil guys
would waste a good teleporter.  Teleporters get brainwashed and made into
shock troops, like those Zhodani \'porters discussed recently on TML.

  "Tiaflfiet IV" Patrol Frigate. Basically a gimmick for the GM, and not
really consistent with AM 4 (IIRC, you _can\'t_ generate non-psionic nobles
or intendants, so all 7 of the officers must be psykers - oops, wrong game).

  Basically the IISS is guessing, and the analyst doing so is unfamiliar with
the true nature of Zho society or the Thought Police ("prevent...defection 
when beyond Zhodani space" - what? - in that zoo of sociopaths?)

  "(a psionicist is) unusual for a non-capital ship...". Yeah, right. OTOH,
these are back in the days when GW did really interesting SF stuff, for which
Mr. Slack (among others) are to be thanked.
