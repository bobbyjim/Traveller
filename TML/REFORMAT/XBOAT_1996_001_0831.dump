 MicroJumps are, as far as I can tell, canonical (there\'s that
 word, again) back to the Little Black Books, and were used for
 exactly the purpose in your example.  As I recall, in Classic
 Traveller, they took the same amount of fuel as a J1 for the ship
 in question; in MT, they took half that.

Do you understand how viruses work?  As I said in my previous posting, the
genetic codes (sequences of base-pairs corresponding to given amino acids)
are likely to be completely different between unrelated biospheres (barring
your Greg-Hoyle-esque "panspermia" hypothesis, which I find wholly untenable
and unsupported by the existing "canon" literature).  So if the Suerrat-world
DNA code codes guanine as CGA but the Vland-world DNA uses TCG (left-handed,
moreover, for incompatability) and the Geonee-world DNA is UGA (hell, let\'s
assume they use uracil in DNA instead of RNA over there) while Earth and the
Vegans and the Tahavi mantaforms all use something else completely different,
then how the hell, pray tell, will you get compatible viruses between these
divergent ecosystems?  One attempting the crossover will produce nothing but
random junk, not a fresh protein coat and virus progeny.  So, again, the
Vilani will, in all likelihood, have no experience whatsoever with viral
infections, but only with bacteria and other macro-parasites.

Note that encoding proteins differently still preserves inter-edibility:
Suerrat and Vegan and Terran lifeforms are all carbon-based and use the
same amino acids, they just encode for them differently during reproduction
or mitosis or what-have-you.  So you can still have opportunities for
hunting in Animal Encounters without corresponding opportunities for viral
infection.

This is, of course, a good objection.  However, since we as Traveller referees
are trying to build on "canon" except where we explicitly disgree with it
(which all Traveller referees, of course, are entitled to do and usually do!),
and since "canon" does not describe such viral outbreaks during early Vilani
contacts with multiple human races (which would have, no doubt, significantly
affected their own technology, culture, procedures in dealing with other
humans, etc.), then we must needs assume that the Ancients "sterilized" their
transplanted human servitors, as no doubt they had the capability to do.  It
would make sense to assume that your primitive human servants weren\'t going
to be put out by random viral infections, so you eliminate all traces of same.
Yeah, it requires possibly superfluous/unnecessary actions by the Ancients:
but it\'s not an untoward stretch of the imagination, and it preserves "canon",
therefore it\'s a reasonable assumption.  If you wish to violate "canon", you
are of course welcome to do so, but should acknowledge that you\'re doing it.

Dave Nilsen once commented that his research work on unifying and referring
to previously published material probably made him the greatest authority on
the many hidden inconsistencies within the Traveller background.  And the
dates given for early Solomani/Vilani interaction are, according to my
researches, one of those glitches.

The 8th and 9th Interstellar Wars are definitely separate and distinct from
the Nth: Classic Supplement 11 (Library Data N-Z), p. 11, notes the Nth is
"-2235 to -2219" (as you noted above).  The First Interstellar War lasted
from -2408 to -2400 (ibid), "the second through seventh wars were marked by
seesaw exchanges of territory, mostly confined to the Dingir and Sol
subsectors."  "Terran invention of the jump-3 drive made the ninth war a
crushing victory for Terra and forced the Imperium to relinquish most of the
Solomani Rim."  And modern convention "simply labels all interstellar wars
after the Ninth with the indeterminate variable N."

Unfortunately, of course, the MegaTraveller Referee\'s Companion, with its
figure of -2210 (p. 34, as you noted), directly contradicts that written
history, since the Nth War was over some nine years previously!  That same
page quotes Terran discovery of Jump1 as "-2431", but if we take Alien Module
8\'s figure of 2087 AD and subtract the 4520-year difference between Solomani
year 1 A.D. and Imperial year 0 (see Supplement 8 chronology, p. 10), we find
that discovery occured in -2433.  Similar difficulties occur in reconciling
dates among Library Data, Solomani, Solomani & Aslan, Referee\'s Companion,
and assorted other references.  Oh, usually only a year or two, mind you,
but enough to worry the pedants among us (myself included).

So, unfortunately, we are up a creek as far as exactly chronicling the early
Solomani-Vilani contacts and conflicts go.  No doubt, as you say, Traveller-4
will unify and correct all these published materials in the Interstellar Wars
milieu book.  For now, however, each referee has to adjudicate it separately
and rely on "historical errors" to justify an individual interpretation.  (I
have, for example, moved the Treaty of New York (-2499, but glossed over in
many later publications) to about a century later in my own setting for
purposes of greater Terran disunity and excitement, assuming it was a very
early math error by Sylean historians converting between Imperial, Vilani,
and Solomani systems, perpetuated throughout the literature)).

Anybody else want to leap in to repair the chronology?  Given time, I can
dig up more disagreements in the published "canon".  And I\'m sure other
areas of the literature have their own bugaboos.  Would that Dave Nilsen
would publish his list so we could all wrangle over them!  :-)

As do I!  I just see a difference between "memory duplication," which by
all means should require higher tech levels (and does, in all published
material!), and "sleep-teaching", which does NOT involve "copying" memories
from one person to another, but rather, the CREATION of memories from whole
cloth within the subject.  The professor\'s machine is said to be "a custom-
built device which lays on a new personality with a combination of drug-
induced changes and hypnosis reinforced by sleep tapes" (p. 33).  In large
part, IMHO, this involves convincing the subject to believe or learn something
rather than reproducing a full-fledged memory from another person.  (Remember
that the "personality overlays" produced are not, in themselves, individual
personae, but just TYPES -- "aspiring intendant," "tourist," "meddling
busybody," etc.)  I don\'t see any reason why growth-quickened clones could not
receive basic training in a similar fashion: overlays of beliefs and skills
over their "natural" (and, for socially-isolated vat-grown clones, probably
rather bland) personalities.

Perhaps you should define exactly what YOU mean by "partial memory dupe."

Of course not!  But if you\'d read my whole quote, rather than just seizing
on the part that supports your own argument, you might note that the Solomani
also used robots for "expert medical robots or administrative support."  Would
you want a robot to look after your tender combat casualties?  Well, if it
CAN, mightn\'t it not be applicable for child-care as well?

I\'m not sure you can draw that much from the encouter tables.  I doubt
they were so carefully draw up as to consider evey possible issue and,
as I remember, they usually don\'t address edibility (just how dangerous
they are and how hard to kill).  I don\'t think you can draw much on
how common edible organisms are from these tables.

Again, even if every adventure is set in a world where organsims are
inedible, and even if all the races in the supplements are from such
worlds, you are still a _long_ way from unique.  An occurance of
<10% would consistent with this also.

I don\'t know about the "original" post.  It was certainly the subject
of _my_ original post (when I pointed out you can\'t make certain statements
because there is not enough science to support the issue either way) and
from which all these posts have been drived.  There certainly has been
some topic drift in other posts, but in these cases I make a conscious
effort to avoid that.

Yes, encountering another world where other Terran organisms are will
provide _some_ increased risk of viral disease.  However, since
these organisms are themselves protected by a "virally incompatible"
biosphere that danger could be nothing compared to that arising from
encountering Terra.

My postion is that both your approach and GDW are equally valid.  If
you prefer yours, that\'s fine.  I don\'t, think however, you can
characterize GDW\'s as flawed.

I would say you shouldn\'t have presumed that I didn\'t have them in
first place (hence the comment about arrogance).  After all, even
with a what some might consider suitable credentials, I have never
resorted to trying to bolster points by attacking your, or anyone\'s,
credentials.  After all, if one is really right, then you should
simply be able to point out where your opponent is wrong.  There is
not need bring up even what you know about your opponent, let alone
what you speculate to be true.  I am, however, willing to drop the
matter.

I would say that the knowledge accumulated since then is as supportive
of their approach as it is contrary to it.

Again, you are getting arrogant.  You simply _assumed_ that I didn\'t
know what I was talking about just because I didn\'t agree with you.
Then, when I call you to account for it, you restort to calling
it "whinging".  I suggest more respect for your opponents might
be called for.

You can\'t just subtract \'the 4520-year difference between Solomani year =
1 A.D. and Imperial year 0\'. The Imperial calender operates with a year =
of exactly 365 days, while the Solomani have 365.25 days in a year. This =

me for a moment.

* Spinward Marches (CT Supplement #3) - 440 Worlds, 872.123 billion population
spread across 16 subsectors in c. 1100 Imperial. Thats an average of 1.982
billion per world or 54.5 billion per subsector. (And, yes, I know it\'s
sparsely settled, but, like I said, bear with me)

* Terran Confederation (CT Alien Module #6: Solomani): c. 42 Subsectors at the
beginning of the Nth Interstellar War, c. 20 Subsectors *outside* the Ziru
Sirka\'s prewar borders.

* Ziru Sirka (as above): At Forst Contact, approx. 310 subsectors ... approx.
292 at the beginning of the Nth Interstellar War.

* First Contact: Based on current extrapolations, Terra = 11 billion (perhaps
less, probably less) ... assuming 54.5 billion average per subsector for the
Vilani Imperium, the Ziru Sirka has around 17000 billion people.

* Beginning, Nth Interstellar War: Terran Confederation has (based on 54.5
billion per Subsector), around 1000 billion *outside* the old ZS\'s borders and
around another 1200 billion in the "occupied territories".

Thus, we can see that for the 1st Interstellar War the ZS had 1500:1 odds
against the Terrans (and, yes, I know that they didn\'t even realise what was
going on *was* a war ... and that the Sector Governor, with a potential 900
billion population (based on 54.5 billion per subsector) had to rely on his
own resources.

At the beginning of the Nth Interstellar War the ZS had 14:1 odds (assuming
that occupied subsectors of the ZS are not counted as part of the Terran
Confeds population; and, while we are told that many such welcomed the Terrans,
I think we can safely say that they would not have been of a net benefit to
the Terran War effort ... there would have been some resistance from the
pre-Terran ruling classes and, if they were replaced wholesale, the terrans
would have had to emplace considerable resources to garrison the planets,
ensure social stability and the like) against the Terrans. How big a threat
were the Vargr? Enough to attract 1/3 of Imperial attention? Say that\'s the
case, and the Terrans are *still* outnumbered (on the face of it) around 9 or
10:1.

Now, it is pretty much universally acknowledged that the attacker must have at
least 3:1 odds against the Defender to have a better than 50% chance of
winning. Here we have a situation where, on the face of the above figures,
the Ziru Sirka (which by the last wars was fully aware of Terran intentions)
canm apply triple that figure, theoretically, along the whole border with the
TC! Sure, the overall figure isn\'t as important as what the attacker can bring
to bear locally ... forces evenly matched can still achieve successes by
picking the time and place of their attack and making sure that have 3:1 or
greater odds then and there. Still, the above figures don\'t look good for the
Solomani ... on the face of it.

Sure, we can factor in a *tiny* advantage because *some* of the Solomani forces
have TL/12 gear and the ZS still only has TL/11 (remember, the Regency
Sourcebook seems to pooh-pooh the idea that there is any great difference in
force multipliers between TL/15 and TL/16 as we had been previously assured
there was and, on the face of it, it seems as if there is even less difference
between TL/12 and TL/11, apart from J3, than between TL/15 and TL/16). We can
factor in some sort of "decadence" factor and "hide bound tactics" factor as
well, but with 10:1 odds, things *still* look bad for the Terrans. You can
even try to assume (perhaps quite reasonably) that the Vilani hadn\'t geared up
for wartime production until the start of the Nth Interstellar War, and give
the Terrans a modest material advantage because of that. But still, on the face
of it, it seems like the Terrans are in a *deep* hole.

What do they need to become viable. Well, one option is a bigger population
.. but the sort of growth rates to get from 11 billion to 1000 billion in 300
years are pretty gross already. The other option is much simpler, and requires
no heroic (or *anti*heroic) use of tuber colonies ... it is to use the
population you have in a more militarily effective way ... by having industries
that are more productive per worker, requiring less to keep them running so
that more can be put into uniform, and by using masses of materiel in place of
masses of men (a standard US style trick in WW1, WW2, Korea, Vietnam and the
Gulf). To run a "rich man\'s" war, in effect. We know that the Vilani were quite
hidebound *and* it is implied that their factories were *manned* factories --
but we have implications that the Terrans had *robotic* assistants from at
least TL/12 on a widespread *tactical* scale, so why not assume that they had
had robotic factories with virtually no workers from well before that. Socially
disruptive, the Vilani say ... but the Terrans don\'t give a damn as long as
they win the war! *And* it explains why the Terrans were able to dominate
Vilani industry and economics in the post Imperial period.

But, you reasonably ask, why are things so expensive in Traveller? Well, we can
assume that, despite some claims to the contrary, the Terrans were absorbed by
Vilani culture far more thoroughly than anyone admits, and there was a gradual
move back to more labour intensive, but socially stable, manned factories.
After all, the Solomani were at the top of the social and economic heap now,
and they got all the goodies regardless of how they were produced.

And, note, this accepts the possibility of higher population growth rates than
I would, FWIW, personally find believable and also allows for all the other
things that people are so attached to. Sound reasonable now? Do you have to use
this? No, never said anyone had to, and, frankly, it doesn\'t worry me if you
all use Tuber Colonies and assume that the Plague of Duskir was the war winner.
This is a *game* after all. But, again FWIW, I think that my position is better
than most, fits the facts at least as well as many of the rest, and is more
likely overall ... but, hey, that\'s a personal opinion. Let it rest at that
if you are all hot and bothered over the matters raised.

Whether there were Tuber colonies (not necessary, Occam\'s razor, I would say)
or whether the Vilani had good medical tech, while interesting in and of
themselves, my contention is that the facts seem to support the likelihood of
my original suggestion regardless of whether you accept or reject my positions
on those other matters.

(Using the Spinward Marches numbers will give the right *relative* figures, I
suspect, even if the absolute figures are wrong. And, if anything, I suspect
that the actual balance of population was *much* more against the Terrans than
the use of the Spinward Marches figures would suggest. The Imperium had been
around for a couple of millennia by then after all, and even with Tuber
colonies, the Terrans had only had a couple of hundred years).

It is also .4 billion more than the average produced by generating the

First of all there is no basis to conclude that the Terra of the Traveller
universe will behave the way current projections predict the Real Life Terra
will. If GDW (or DGP working under license) states something that logically
requires Terra to have a higher population than 11 billion, then obviously
things worked out differently in their universe. Now, perhaps you think that
more than 11 billion people are not just unlikely but starkly impossible, but
others appear to disagree with you. (About the only data we have about the
population of Terra is that it is possible (at least with TL 15) to have 42
billion people and still keep the environment healthy (Traveller Digest 13
or 14, I think). Since that is in 1100 it tells us very little one way or
the other about conditions during the Interstellar wars.

There is no reason why the average population of a Ziru Sirka planet has to
be the same as the average population of a Third Imperium planet. We just
don\'t know. What we do know is that the Ziru Sirka must have practiced some
form of population control (do I have to elaborate on this?). Perhaps they
deliberately kept their planetary populations small (perhaps in order to
ensure prosperity for all). We just don\'t know. (However, from the fact that
the Terran Confederation was able to outfight them it seems likely that the
ZS _didn\'t_ have a 1500:1 advantage over them).

The reverse argument can be used to "prove" that since the ZS wasn\'t able to
stand up to the TC then obviously the Vargr were a bigger threat than that.

Very true. So perhaps the figures are wrong.

I don\'t have access to my books right now; where does it say that only some
of the Terran forces were TL 12? Going by the TCS rules it should not take
more than 50 years tops to upgrade a navy by one TL.

>(remember, the Regency Sourcebook seems to pooh-pooh the idea that there is
>any great difference in force multipliers between TL/15 and TL/16

Allow me to suggest the (possibly unwarranted) possibility that the authors
of the Regency Sourcebook had not extensively playtested TCS-type campaigns
between TL 15 and TL 16 forces.

>as we had been previously assured there was and, on the face of it, it seems
>as if there is even less difference between TL/12 and TL/11, apart from J3,

Steve Higginbotham once estimated that TL 12 navies have a 2 to 1 advantage
over TL 11 navies. This assumes that both sides have been designed by people
who knew what they were doing. If one side was composed of ships like those
published in most official sources and the other side were properly designed
then almost anything is possible.

>We can factor in some sort of "decadence" factor and "hide bound tactics"
>factor as well,

This is quite likely for the first wars. If the ZS are used to fighting with
numbers on their side then design flaws might very well have been overlooked.
I would expect them to improve over time, though. Still, if the TL 12 step
took place just before the final push then the Terran forces may have found
some design flaw that they could _really_ exploit. You see, so much depends
on the design. Something that works quite well against TL 11 opponents may
be utter disaster against newly encountered TL 12 opponents (but in time
new TL 11 designs would approach the 2 to 1 factor).

>but with 10:1 odds, things *still* look bad for the Terrans.

I quite agree. So perhaps the odds were _not_ 10:1 after all.

>What do they need to become viable.

Different basic assumptions about Terran population levels, Vilani population
levels, Vargr population levels, cohesiveness of Vilani empire (how much real
cooperation was there for example between the three bureaux? How many Vilani
governors tried to become Emperor instead of the Emperor?), Vilani ship
designs, Vilani fleet doctrines... stuff like that. And while we CAN dismiss
some aspects of the _Imperium_ board game as being grossly oversimplified, it
would be nice if the basic assumptions produced effects that mimic those of
the game.

>But, you reasonably ask, why are things so expensive in Traveller?

Well, one reason is that the whole economic system is broken.

>(Using the Spinward Marches numbers will give the right *relative* figures, I
>suspect, even if the absolute figures are wrong.

But the Spinward Marches figures are for an altogether different period of
time with an altogether different prior history. There is no reason to
believe that either the ZS nor the TC had the same kind of population
distribution. They _could_ have, of course, but they could equally well
not have. And, indeed, given that your assumptions makes the force disparity
between the ZS and the TC so great, there\'s some reason to argue that they
did not.

The Vilani had been in space for ten milennia, IIRC, and had stopped
expanding long before. They must have practiced some kind of birth
control, otherwise they would have expanded far more. Given that, there
is no way to estimate just what level they had chosen to freeze their
population at.

For the sake of brevity, let me summarize your calculations:

x=average subsector poulation in Spinward Marches (54.5 billion)
s=number of Solomani subsectors
z=number of Ziru Sirka subsectors
.: s*x=total Solomani population
.: v*x=total Ziru Sirka population
.: v*x:s*x=ratio of Ziru Sirka population to Solomani population

So, using your assumptions, the actual population *figures* don\'t matter.
If you assume a constant population density (which you\'ve done), all that
matters for determining these odds is the number of subsectors commanded by
one side or the other. This discounts the possibility of greater population
density on one side or the other (which is what the debate about vat-grown
Solomani was all about).

Universally acknowledged by whom?  I\'ve never heard of this sort of military
algebra before.  This aside, there\'s the whole problem of how much of their
massive resources the Vilani could have brought to bear and how much they
actually wanted to.  First, their huge population was spread across a much
larger area, and in _Traveller_, that is a non-trivial problem.  Also
remember the first seven Interstellar Wars were restricted to a single
*subsector* [MT-"Nth Interstellar War, IE, p.33].  With the benefit of
hindsight, we can see the Interstellar Wars for a battle to take over the
First Imperium, but the whole process took nearly two hundred years, so it
probably took the Vilani a very long time to realize they were fighting for
their lives.

Furthermore,  not everybody was terribly happy to be subject to the Pax
Villanica and would have either passively or actively supported the
Solomani.  For instance, Vegans "were severely restricted under Vilani rule,
as wer all races who resisted being integrated into the rigid Vilani
culture.  Because of this, they welcomed Terran victory in the Interstellar
Wars and the advent of the Rule of Man" [MT-"Vegans", IE, p.44].  In actual
Terran history, situations like this have enabled low-population,
technologically disadvantaged groups to conquor empires with more human and
material resources (e.g. the Arab-Islamic conquest of the Sassanian and most
of the Byzantine Empires).

The difference between TL11 and TL12 is far from "tiny".  TL12 gives you
Jump-3 ships (50% faster than Jump-2).  This means that you can move troops,
naval fleets, and *information* around half again as fast as the enemy.
Also, TL12 gives you *robots*.  The Solomani didn\'t use warbots, but the use
of robots for medical and administrative support, as well as for lots of
construction would have freed up a lot of their population for fighting the
war (Book 8, _Robots_, p.6).  And what\'s this with the Regency Sourcebook?
I thought DG and TNE weren\'t "canon" :)?

>But, you reasonably ask, why are things so expensive in Traveller?

Actually, I don\'t.  Nor do I ask about interstellar conflicts that (as of
1100) are more than three thousand years old.  I\'m more concerned with
elements of the _Traveller_ universe that have a direct influence on my
players (e.g. the question of how to make a free trader economically
viable).  I don\'t sit around cooking up conspiracy theories to explain
things away.  As much as possible, I take the rules and background as given.

Correct me if I\'m wrong but these odds assume that both the Terrans and Vilani
conscript equal proportions of the population into the armed services?? What I
mean is that out of, for example 100 people 1 of them is in the armed services,
both for Terra and Vland. If the Terrans were more automated in their
production and other areas then they would probably be able to conscript 2 of
every 100 people into the armed services, for example. I suppose what I\'m
trying to say is that even though Terras population was smaller it could
possibly have a larger percentage in the armed services than the Vilani.

On the subject of prices of common items costing so much what I think is that
the prices given for say a TL12 air/raft represent how much it costs at TL12.
It should then devalue with progressing TL as it\'s becoming old tech, with
newer models at higher TL costing the about the same as the price stated in the
book. There is also the option of purchasing second hand equipment as well...

All this doesn\'t really matter, IMO. If the Ziru Sirka was decadent enough
then just about anything could be possible. About all this shows is just
how bad the ZS had become before the Terrans pushed them over the edge.

Yes, I see what you are getting at. However, even leaving out Viruses (and as
you accept partly that there are many other Terran inhabited planets settled
during the Ancient period, there is a good chance that *they* will have viruses
endemic there), bacteria are a big enough problem! So, leaving out the matter
of viruses which may well be unacceptably optimistic to assume what I had, this
still leaves the matter of bacteria ... and the Vilani are going to be subject
to those effects regardless. Then, unfortunately, consider the current problem
with Bovine Spongiform Encephalitis (and its Human, Feline and other variants),
which is thought to be *either* an as yet unidentified virus *or* the as yet
unproven (existence wise) "prions" ... which are some sort of protein, as I
understand it (and, having been in the UK for 6 weeks in 1988, I am following
the matter with some interest, being a non-vegetarian :-( ... ), and this seems
(on my understanding of it) to be potentially free of such objections as may
apply to viruses. I would hazard a guess, based on nothing other than a gut
feeling, that there are going to be a hell of lot of potential traps out there
where alien organisms may be quite nasty in their interactions with humans,
regardless (and, perhaps, *because*) of their base DNA compatibility etc. So
the Vilani may be more experienced in *other* areas than the Terrans.

But there\'s the matter of mutation. As I understand it, diseases have a
short(ish) "life cycle" where they start off as the nastiest form and gradually
mutate (along with human resistance to them) into less nasty forms ... thus the
childhood diseases, for example, as we all know, were all originally killers
like Smallpox (or in that degree of severity). The reverse, as far as I
understand it, is also potentially true ... otherwise benign bacteria (and
viruses, even, I spose?) will have a chance of mutating ... especially where
they are in contact with alien biospheres and influences. Given their short
lifespans and potentially high rate of mutation, this means that the
development of local bacteria that may be rather nasty is reasonably high, as I
understand it. Also, there is the probability that one planet\'s human
inhabitants may be quite at home with some bacteria that will prove lethal to
any human visitors from another planet.

The problem, as we both admit, is that canon is so vague that you have to fill
it in from *you own* idea of what makes sense. Obviously this will differ from
person to person ... and both you and I believe that the assumptions the other
is making are incompatible with canon. That\'s life, I guess!

Well, I don\'t see how sleep teaching, however advanced, can create a useful

But look at the portable medical computer equipment in Traveller. All it does
(even the higher tech stuff) - well, what it *mainly* does - is to support the
work of medical personnel. It doesn\'t really replace them. It seems to be more
like a palliative care unit that is bright enough ... under close supervision,
of course ... to call for help when it is programmed to see it is needed. Maybe
I\'m just wary of relying on computers too much :-}

Correct me if I\'m wrong, and I very well could be, but wasn\'t ther a major
anti-Robotic prejudice in the Third Imperium?  This might account for the
lack of robots found in the equipment guides(if you consider robots equipment).

Well, regardless of whether it is 11 billion early next century or not, the
figure of 17000 billion for the Vilani Imperium is based on the average figure
for the Spinward Marches.

No, of course there isn\'t. However, we\'re merely looking at some likely figures
here. Sure, the Vilani may have practised population control, but the Vilani in
the Third Imperium do not seem to have. And, in any case, as we\'ve all noted,
the initial wars were all with the sector Governor nearest Terra ... and we
don\'t know how much of a population base he had at this time. All we are
looking at is averages across a whole Interstellar Empire.

Yes. So perhaps they are. On the other hand, perhaps, even though they may be
"wrong" in one sense, they seem to be reasonable in terms of the overall
picture and the likely *relative* populations of Imperial Worlds. After all,
an average of 55 billion per subsector is not all that great for a 3000 year
old empire. Even if you assume *half* that, you are looking at 8500 billion for
the whole Empire and less than a billion per world on average ... and *still*
750:1 if against 11 billion terrans (or 550:1 vs. 15 billion Terrans, which is,
I believe, the *old* figure for Terran population maxing out in the next
century ... and, after all, the Terrans encountered the Vilani on their *first*
Interstellar Jump, so there were no significant colonies to boost this figure).

But according to the (admittedly contradictory) timeline, there\'s only around
9 years between the Terran acquisition of TL/12 and the beginning of the last
Nth Interstellar War. Given Traveller shipbuilding rates of up to 5 years for
large ships, a significant proportion of the TC navy would still have been non
J-3 capable J-2 ships, or it seems likely to be based on what we know of the
Third Imperium.

Yes, but regardless of whether they had or hadn\'t, they still have a whole
section "debunking" the idea that they presented in *Darrians* that TL/16 gear
was an order of magnitude better than TL/15. According to this new material
there are marginal differences ... so marginal, in fact, that they seem to be
insignificant in a military sense. Check it out if you haven\'t already.

Yes, but based on previously published materials (Darrians etc.) TL/16 was an
order of magnitude better than TL/15 ... so much better that even TL/16
*merchantmen* refitted with TL/14-15 Imperial weapons and used by the Darrians
as regular naval combatants ... yet GDW has, in the Regency Sourcebook,
rewritten the rules to make them so marginal an improvement as to be militarily
insignificant. Then, consider this, the Terrans have 9 years to pick up all the
advantages, if any major ones at all, between TL/12 and the beginning of the
last war. And, in any case, if you assume that the ZS had a much smaller
population, then the amount of people the Terrans  "captured" when they took
ZS territory is much smaller ... so we still have around a 3.5:1 to 7:1
superiority even if we assume that the ZS is half the population I orginally
calculated. And that is *not* assuming that the TC is half what I consider to
be a ridiculous figure based on the *unmodified* 54.5 billion per subsector
that you dispute for the ZS (where it is more justified considering its age).

Yeah. They are configured (more than likely) for "colonial wars" a la the
British Army of the 19th Century. However with, potentially a 3.5:1 to 7:1
advantage and much higher TL weapons to begin with to "overawe the natives"
(who may well have quite a high TL themselves), the factor should *probably*
not be estimated.

Yes, but these figures are for First Contact and the First Interstellar War.
Before Tuber Colonies could have had any significant effect -- and I believe
that they are from later in the piece than this period. So, the ZS had a larger
population *by far* at the start.

Well, as a wargamer since 1970, and as a reader of much military history and
the like I have come across this statement in assorted Field Manuals, Battle
Reports, Wargames, Military Documents, and statements by famous Generals (and
successful ones, to!). I assume you are being facetious here? This has been
known for at least as long as there has been any professional military art
at all (say, since the Romans if not the Greeks ... though lost, undoubtedly,
during the Middle Ages). This is not personal assertion or opinion, it is
"generally accepted" as noted.

As for the fact that the Terrans were initially blessed with interior lines
and closeness to their logistic bases than the ZS may have been. This makes as
much assumptions about the ZS as about the Terrans. The first wars seem to have
had to have had Terra as the logistic base, and with only 15 billion population
(remember, it takes time to grow even Tubers ... even if you accept their
existence, and, for the sake of this argument let us assume that they do) at
the start (the generally accepted population max out at the time GDW wrote
CTrav. Even allowing for 40 billion by c. 2010 (which assumes a ridiculously
high growth rate for the 1970\'s on), the Terrans are intially outnumbered.

Then, consider that at TL/10 (the start of the 1st Interstellar War), they
have had neither the time nor the tech to create tuber colonies, and that
this would have taken generations, probably centuries, to redress, then the
achievements of such a small number of people as the Terrans had *in comparison
to what the ZS had* seems so much more unlikely. At the end of the period,
sure, the factors that you assume would have likely redressed the problem ...
and a growth from 15 billion to in excess of 1000 billion Terrans in around
300 years is a pretty incredible (and I mean it in a derogatory sense, not
believing in Tubers) growth rate ... and that doesn\'t allow for some of the
1200 billion or so in the conquered Vilani colonies to actually be Terran
colonists *nor* does it allow for the many Terran colonies outside the TConfed
(rimward and also towards the Aslan borders). So the Tubers simply do a partial
job of redressing a massive imbalance in favour of the ZS.

And note that the last wars are noted as having attracted the entire attention
of the Empire (well, apart from the Vargr) ... and, allowing for the fact that
the Vargr were attacking the ancient heartlands of the Imperium *and* did so
well as they are alleged to have done, then this seems to imply most of the
Imperial forces were being committed, or in the process of being committed, to
the Terran Front. And as the Terrans advanced *they* were getting further and
further from their bases and the Vilani getting closer and closer to their.
So, my assumption is that the Terran *mass* of equipment and ships simply
overwhelmed them is not that far fetched. Not the only solution, sure, but more
likely than many.

Yes, and this still doesn\'t give the Terrans all that much of a definite
advantage. The Vegans (and others) would still have had to have been integrated
into the Terran Confed to be of any use ... their factories, for example,
would have been geared up to produce Vilani standard gear and not Terran
Standard (and related problems). And as for you example, historically speaking,
there is now mounting evidence that such things as command and control
problems, economic problems (failure to pay the troops) and the like had as
much to do with the initial Arab successes as any dislike based on primarily
religious matters (which is, of course, neither here nor their).

As for the former. Well, consider construction times ... a large military (or
civilian) style ship takes up to 5 years to build. The time between Terran
acquisition of J3 and the outbreak of the last war was nine years. Ergo, it
seems almost certain that only a small percentage of Terran Naval strength at
the beginning of the war was J3 capable. And the Terrans were still outnumbered
between 7 and 14:1. So the Vilani, once they are aware of the Terran
capability, can easily circumvent it by attacking where the Terran J3
squadrons *arent* and/or simply garrisoning their systems in depth. Consider
the similarity (in a weird sort of way) to the situation of the Germans at
the end of WW2 ... lots of high tech equipment, but the allies had *humungous*
amounts of medium tech equipment and simply steamrollered them. Even allowing
for TL/11-12 difference to halve the Vilani numerical advantage, this means
that, all other things being equal, the Vilani still outnumbered the TC 3.5:1
to 7:1.

Now, I\'m not saying that the Terrans couldn\'t win, I\'m simply saying that they
did it by outproducing the Vilani ... by using robotic factories when the
Vilani were using manned factories. Perhaps ships of a tonnage that took the
Vilani 5 years to produce took the Terrans 1 year to produce? Or less -
considering how geared up for war they would have been. This is a more
reasonable explanation *to me* than Tuber colonies. But, hey, to each his own!

Well, according to Striker 2, there\'s not a great enough difference between
a warlike and peaceful world\'s armed forces size to make a dint in the 1500:1
odds (or 7:1 to 14:1 for the Nth Interstellar War). The Terrans not only have
to conscript a larger percentage, they need to conscript a massively larger
percentage ... *and* they *also* HAVE to have a massively more productive
economy to allow for this conscription *and* allow for mass production of
weapons at a level the Vilani just couldn\'t match.

Consider this. Armies in peacetime are rarely more than 2-3% of population (and
mostly less) because of the economic cost. In wartime, percentages usually go
to no more than 5-6% (in modern times at least). Israel managed 10% in times of
need ... but the whole national economy grinds to a halt and wars *have* to be
short as a result. The Soviets managed slightly more than this during WW2, but
were only able to do so because Lend Lease substituted more efficient US
factory workers for Soviet ones, who could then be sent to the front.

So assume that the Terrans manage 10% ... 100 billion ... at the beginning of
the Nth Interstellar War (and some of these would have to be on the borders
*opposite* the ZS, and, therefore, useless). The ZS has only 5%, or "only*
800 billion. Say 1/3 on the Vargr border ... or 500 billion to oppose the
Terrans. 5:1 odds still!

Yes! And there is actually a "rule" to that effect in Mercenary (book #4), but
it has never been reprinted in the later MTrav or TNE gear! So, presumably, GDW
decided it wasn\'t correct? Anyone know?

Ahem!

The "Solomani" (actually Gregorian) calendar has years that are
365.2425 years long. It was introduced by Pope Gregory in 1582 AD.
Dates of adoption on Terra vary from 1582 (Catholic countries) thru
1752 (Britain and colonies) on up into the 20th century (The USSR
adopted it only after the revolution)!

Its predecessor the Julian calendar (introduced by Julius Caesar in 42?
BC) has the length of 365.25 days. The difference between the two is
that in the Julian calendar every 4th year is a leap year. In the
Gregorian calendar century years (years ending in 00) are only leap
years if they are divisible by 400. Thus 1600 and 2000 are leap years
in both systems, while 1700, 1800, and 1900 are only leap years in the
Julian calendar.

There\'s also a variation used by the Orthodox churches, that says
century years are only leap years if when divided by 900 the remainder
is 200 or 600. This gives a year of 365.2422 days. It will disagree
with the Gregorian calendar around 2700 AD.

The Gregorian calendar will require *some* sort of correction around
3000-4000 AD. The Orthodoxcalendar will make it into the Third Imperium
or so before any corrections are needed.

In any case, this makes figuring out the differences even messier. If
someone want to send me the rules for the Imperial calendar, and a date
in that calendar and the corresponding Gregorian date, I\'ll write up a
conversion program. (My books are in storage or I\'d just look it up
myself)

I already have a set of routines that convert between Gregorian dates
and Julian Day Numbers (nothing to do with the Julian calendar!). The
JD# is the number of days since 1 Jan 4400 BC (or somewhere around
there). It\'s useful because calculating in *days* is easier than all
these silly months and years. :-)

So all I have to do is write routines to convert both ways between
Imperial dates and JD#s. If I get the info, I\'ll even post the TP
source for those routines here (it\'ll make some Trav related stuff
easier for folks! :-)

No, I wasn\'t being facetious at all.  I\'m a graduate student studying
medieval Islamic history, and I\'ve *never* heard this before.  It sounds
reasonable for wargaming simulations, but I wouldn\'t rely on it to
reconstruct history.

What assumptions am I making that you haven\'t already?  You based all your
calculations on the population of the *entire* Ziru Sirka, and made it clear
that it was much larger than the Terran Confederation.

You don\'t understand what I\'m getting at.  I didn\'t mean that the Terrans
could rely on Vegans and other unhappy subject races to enhance their forces
(although that certainly is a possibility), but rather that the Vilani
*couldn\'t* rely on a great deal of their population.

[This is getting less and less relevant to _Traveller_, but where is this
"mounting evidence" from?  Most of what we know about the Arab-Islamic
conquests comes from Arab historians two hundred years after the fact--not
the sort of people who would be likely to know too much about Byzantine and
Sassanian economic and C&C problems.  Very rarely does one get "mounting
evidence" about pre-modern history, just new theories about and
interpretations of old evidence.]

I was going to take issue with the discussion of technology, but I made an
interesting discovery:  at the start of the Interstellar Wars, the Terrans
actually were at a technological *disadvantage* (Ref\'s Companion, 34).  One
thing I would like to point out is that Tech Levels are a measurement
*after* the fact.  The Terrans put years of R&D and prototype production
before actually reaching TL12.  They didn\'t just get their TL12 certificate
and start producing Jump-3 ships the next day.

Actually, the more this argument is tossed around, the more I\'m inclined to
go with the theory that the Ziru Sirka collapsed under its own weight, and
the Terrans just happened to be around to take over.  Given the numbers that
you\'re putting out, you\'re right that they couldn\'t have won if it were an
all-out war (like WWII on Earth), plagues, clones, and overproduction
notwithstanding.

In an early issue of JTAS (reprinted in _Best of JTAS I_), Frank Chadwick
has an article on economic differences between worlds based on TL and
starport type.  It may have been reproduced in TNE; I thought I saw the same
chart in the rulebook.  Anyway, it\'s a good concept and it would address
this problem, but it does look a bit complicated.

Actually, the Gregorian calendar will probably be alright because every year
they insert a couple of "leap seconds" into the year if it doesn\'t match up
precisely with the solar year.

The Imperial year is exactly 365 days long.  2087AD=-2431 Imperial (date of
Solomani acqiring jump drive).  I couldn\'t find any exact dates.  According
to Solomani & Aslan, though, the difference between the Solomani and
Imperial calendars is nominal.

Yes, but as I noted, it applies to professional military people as well. Try
reading something general (and interesting to the non-military reader) such as
Dunnigan\'s "How to Make War" and you\'ll see that, as I stated above, 3:1 *is*
generally accepted as being a requisite. It has nothing to do with wargaming
except, insofar as it is relevant, wargamers need to have some knowledge of the
same things professional military people have to. *sigh* I suppose it\'s like
all those idiot "expert" journos who think anything with a gun bigger than a
pistol mounted on it is a "tank" ... whether it\'s a APC, LAV, Armoured Car,
or even a damn Jeep with a machinegun! Not your fault - no, not by any means -
I\'m sure that you could run rings around me in Islamic history! But the general
lack of knowledge that people have about things military ... no doubt *you*
have reason to "sigh" over peoples\' ignorance (say) of the difference between
Shia and Sunni (or whatever is your pet peeve!).

Yes, but unless you\'re assuming that the average population was only a few
hundred thousand each, which is (in my opinion, FWIW) quite ridiculous for all
sorts of reasons, none of which you\'d probably accept.

Well, yes. Perhaps ... but only on those who had some realistic chance of being
"rescued" by the Terrans. And with strict censorship (something the 3rd
Imperium  has inherited from the 1st), they are not likely to get a certain
picture of the "truth".

OK, well, mounting evidence based on re-interpretation of Byzantine histories
scant as they may be) of the period, plus other documents. But the current
line seems to be that, while the Arabs did rather well, they did so more
because of Byzantine incompetence than because of any perceived religious
persecution. Of course, since you have (undoubtedly) a better overview of the
field (I presume) then perhaps my more general reading of the military related
material that I\'m interested in, perhaps you have seen different trends that I
would not be aware of.

Sure. Of course. But it still takes a *long* time between the creation of a
prototype, through pre-production trials, then to gear up to full production.
Especially when we know that for anything over around 5000 tons it takes
5 years to build! Of course, it depends on just what the date we have *means*.
Like all of Traveller, it\'s very vague. However, I would assume that it would
mean that it was the date at which the first examples of such vessels entered
service *for trials* ... and that this still means a considerable delay, just
as I said.

Yep, even disallowing Tuber colonies, that\'s more or less what I\'m saying. A
combination of outproduction and collapse (but I was assuming that the
outproduction is *because* of the fragility of the ZS and its intolerance of
new ideas/techniques that could have saved it).

Yes, I vaguely remember this article. I\'ll have to (re)check it out. But, IIRC,
it was not as comprehensive as what is needed ... but I may well be wrong.

But when arguing against canon one is saddled with the burden of proof. It is
not enough to demonstrate that one\'s own take on a subject is more likely than
canon; one has to demonstrate that the canon is completely unlikely. Not just
unlikely - unlikely chances have come off before in history - but so unlikely
that one absolutely refuse to believe it (The problem here is that we each
have a different level of incredulity ;-).

>Sure, the Vilani may have practised population control, but the Vilani in
>the Third Imperium do not seem to have.

Well, I\'d say that that was one of those things that is never mentioned but
must logically be so. The speed of geometric progressions in their latter
stages are such that IMO the whole history of Charted Space is completely
unlikely (;-) unless one assumes that _every_ spacefaring race practice
birth control - not necessarily everywhere and at all times, but at least
most of the time. (And that includes the Aslans). Note that "population
control" may well take the form of homicide in one of its many aspects,
but the unrestricted population growth potential to humans and similar
critters _must_ be restricted in some way; otherwise the Vilani would
have covered the entire galaxy like a coat of paint in their first 10,000
years.

And restricting a planetary population to a few hundred millions offers
advantages to the quality of life that a population of several tens of
billions could not enjoy on the same planet. The main advantage of a
high population is a high military potential. This is an advantage that
a planet under the _Pax Vilanica_ may well not have appreciated. So I
really think that the assumption that Siru Zirka planetary populations
were generally lower than post-Long Night populations is quite defensible.
I\'ll put it no higher than that.

Yes, they are quite reasonable (though, as I pointed out, they are about 30%
higher than the average you get if you generate populations according to the
random generation system). But that\'s not, IMO, enough to refute the canon.

What I would find acceptable was the notion that a population level of 8
makes for a nice, uncrowded population for a planet whose defensive needs
are served by a large surrounding empire. That would reduce the odds to
7,5:1 and is thus propably too low, if anything. Of course, Vland and any
other \'native\' world would have populations comparable to Terra, so the
average would propably be an order of magnitude more. That gives us 75:1
at the initial contact and seems about right to me. Let me emphasize that
I don\'t put forth these figures as the One True Answer; just one answer
that I could accept.

We should propably accept the initial starting position of the Terrans in
_Imperium_ as reflecting the state o the TC at the start of the first war.
That was two colonies, wasen\'t it?

Yes, nine years is too short a time for a complete replacement of the fleet.
Remember, though, that a major refit of a ship will only take 1/4 the time.
The first thing I would do (in a TCS campaigh) would be to refit those ships
that were suitable with the new drives and weapons.

(And then there is the possibility that engine tech and weapon tech did not
follow each other to the minute; the Terrans could have had meson technology
for longer than 9 years).

Yes, but unless this change was a result of a careful playtesting of actual
proper ship designs, then that \'debunking\' is worth just as much as the

No, they didn\'t rewrite the rules (well, yes, they did, but I strongly
suspect that they didn\'t test them); rather the rewrote the background.

That\'s a very good point. But the Terrans could, by sheer serendipity, have
hit on a design that exploited a major weakness in the Vilani designs. It\'s
not a very likely thing to happen, but it _could_ have. The sources claim
that the meson gun was a major shock to the Vilani. I don\'t know enough about
the combat system to say for sure, but could that be used to explain it?

It\'s certainly _possible_ for the ZS to have populations that high -  heck,
after 3,000 years every planet could have population level A, for that matter
- but I don\'t agree that it is more or less likely than an average of 9.
(Well, except that the fact that the TC was able to conquer the ZS tends to

I really will have to dig out my _Imperium_. That will tell us the proportions

Ah, you\'re making two mistakes here: 1) You\'re assuming that the lessons of
land warfare can be directly translated into space warfare. 2) You\'re
assuming that general rules apply in all cases. But history is full of
examples of battles that didn\'t follow the general rule. Belisaurus used
to _routinely_ beat forces that were 5 and 10 times the size of his own.

But we do have some indication that they could create viable colonies in
quite a short time. The _Imperium_ rules may give a much simplified view
of reality (Traveller reality, mind you), but it must at least correspond
to reality in _some_ degree. If it wasn\'t tuber colonies, then they must
have had some other dodge.

But even so the Vilani could never commit all their forces to the Terran
front. Some must have been left behind to guard the rest of the frontiers.
You might with the same kind of logic say that the goths could never in a
million years conquer the vastly bigger Western Roman Empire; but they did.

According to Striker 1 a peaceful world might use 1% of it\'s GPP (Gross
Planetary Product) while a world at war can use a maximum of 15%. If the
15% represent the maximum effort a society is capable of, it must be
crippling for the economy in the long run; but the Terrans could have
ships laid up in ordinary for far less than the cost of maintaining
them in readiness and then refitted them when the war became imminent.
That could provide a difference of an order of magnitude in their navy
size - always provided the Vilani didn\'t have the smarts to do the
same - a very iffy \'provided\', I admit.

>The Terrans not only have to conscript a larger percentage, they need to
>conscript a massively larger percentage ...

No, that will not be a problem. It takes several thousands of citizens to
pay the ship maintenance of each crew spot. You could man the number of
ships any society could produce with far less than 1% of the population.
Even invasion troop won\'t be a problem, although transport slots for a
soldier is somewhat cheaper than navy crew slots.

Unless the Vilani were unable to use their full potential.

Like all military maxims, this should be taken with a grain of salt, but this
rule of thumb has been taught for years.  In WW2 it was phrased (by the UWS
anyhow) as "you need a company to attack a platoon", "you need a battalian to
attack a company", etc., which worked out roughly (sometimes very roughly) as
3:1.  Charles Roberts borrowed the concept from military thinking when he
founded Avalon Hill, an I\'m told that a few thinktanks (RAND primarily, I
think) spent a lot of the US military\'s money to basically come up wih the
same answer.

Me:
These leap seconds affect how many metric seconds are in a day. This number
varies because the metric second is defined in terms of atomic transitions
in a cesium atom. The day is defined in terms of the earth\'s rotation around
its axis and its revolution around the sun. With two different standards
(or "canons" ---- that word again!) these two different units of time are
bound to get out of sinc sooner or later. Leap seconds are necessary to
correct the problem.

Back in the old days, the second was defined to be 1/86400th of a day.
This problem did not occur then. But scientists wanted a higher
precision definition of a second. This new metric second was designed
to be as close to 1/86400th of a day as possible, but of course,
it can\'t be perfectly close since days can actually vary in length somewhat.

Keeping days and years in sinc, however, is a completely different problem,
one that has nothing to do with cesium atoms. No leaping of seconds will
fix it. You have to have leap days.

Ah, but how long is an Imperial Day?  Is it always 86400 metric seconds (as
Edgar pointed out, our days aren\'t allways that long.) I always assumed they
were 86,459 metric seconds, 1/365th of a sidereal years; since the Imperium
doen\'t have leap days.

Of course, you can assume anything you want. But what you do assume will
affect the nitty-gritty of your calculations.

I\'d also like to point out that if you assume the Impy day is 86400 s
long, the differences between the Imperial and Gregorian calendars
will be more than nominal. It will be over 20000 seconds per year.

The Ine Givar are, primarily, a plot device and a minor piece of
background material.

Their cause is to further confuse players as to the true purpose of having
Zhodani in the game. They\'re mostly trying to get players to follow
red herrings. Their cause is difficult to determine, but is probably
due to a sneaky refere.

Well, you name \'em. Probably a lot of anarchists go around
claiming to be the Ine Givar when they\'re really just dorks
with bombs, or more probably, terrorists from within the Imperium
trying to blame stuff one someone else.

What I would find acceptable was the notion that a population level of 8
makes for a nice, uncrowded population for a planet whose defensive needs
are served by a large surrounding empire. That would reduce the odds to
7,5:1 and is thus probably too low, if anything. Of course, Vland and any
other \'native\' world would have populations comparable to Terra, so the
average would probably be an order of magnitude more. That gives us 75:1
at the initial contact and seems about right to me. Let me emphasize that
I don\'t put forth these figures as the One True Answer; just one answer
that I could accept.

We should probably accept the initial starting position of the Terrans in
_Imperium_ as reflecting the state o the TC at the start of the first war.
That was two colonies, wasn\'t it?

Yep, 1 main system, 2 Colonies, 3 Outposts. Approximately 1/4 of the
colonies excess resources is shipped to Sol and all of the outposts excess
resources are shipped to a colony or Sol.
Note that Sol and the colonies have approximately 8 times the excess
production potential of the Vilani Worlds.

Yes, nine years is too short a time for a complete replacement of the fleet.
Remember, though, that a major refit of a ship will only take 1/4 the time.
The first thing I would do (in a TCS campaign) would be to refit those ships
that were suitable with the new drives and weapons.

(And then there is the possibility that engine tech and weapon tech did not
follow each other to the minute; the Terrans could have had meson technology
for longer than 9 years).
 ----

Seeing as Meson Guns appear at TL 11 the TC could have had them for a long
time.
I assumed that the Terran B and BB ships in Imperium were armed with Meson
Guns.

 ----
>Then, consider this, the Terrans have 9 years to pick up all the

That\'s a very good point. But the Terrans could, by sheer serendipity, have
hit on a design that exploited a major weakness in the Vilani designs. It\'s
not a very likely thing to happen, but it _could_ have. The sources claim
that the meson gun was a major shock to the Vilani. I don\'t know enough
about
the combat system to say for sure, but could that be used to explain it?
 ----

There are several reasons why the Meson Gun would be such a shock to the
Vilani.

1. They didn\'t know how they worked at all, hence they had the shock of
dealing with an enemy equipped with a "magic" weapon!

2. The only previous encounter they had had was at Sambiqys (sp?) which had
become mythological to the extent that it was the equivalent of a "boogie
man".

3. The Vilani ship designs and tactics took no account of Meson Guns and
were heavily optimised to defeat a missile/Pacc/Laser threat.
   Under High Guard (and therefore MT) the best defence against Meson guns
is small size and agility, the best defence against the other weapons is to
be a big heavily armoured sphere, which is too massive to have much agility
at all.
   The Vilani had thousands of years to optimise their ship designs to
defeat all the weapons they knew about. Look at the Imperial ship
silhouettes in Imperium and you see lots of spheres.
   The best weapons to attack such ships (in the absence of Meson guns, for
which they are the perfect targets) are Nuclear Missiles and really big
Pacc\'s.
   The factors in Imperium reflect this in the high missile factors assigned
to most Imperial ships.
   The Terrans OTOH seem to have concentrated on beam weapons, possibly
because of political restrictions on the deployment of nukes, and defences
based on agility, which is more effective v\'s beam weapons than missiles.

When the TC got J-3 and TL12 it would have complicated the Vilani\'s position
considerably because the TC could now communicate up to 50% faster than they
could. This would act as a considerable force multiplier. Also the Vilani
now had to defend many more systems against a J3 attack than the TC did
against the Vilani.

During the Nth war the Terrans appear to have broken through to the rear
areas of the ZS and moved so fast that the Vilani couldn\'t respond. The
Terrans would appear at worlds well inside the ZS, engage the local defence
forces (if any) with "magic" weapons and then dissappear again, all before
word of their coming had arrived!
I would think that this sort of thing would have caused massive morale
problems for the ZS.

Looking at the counters for Dark Nebula, the Solomani seem to be using
Vilani ship designs during the long night...

I really will have to dig out my _Imperium_. That will tell us the
proportions
of the forces involved in the first wars. However, remember that the Vilani
governor is tied hand and foot in his struggle.
 ----

The size of the forces are fairly close in the first wars, with the
Imperials holding a slight edge. The Imperials should prevail providing that
the player is competent and the Imperials don\'t get too much bad luck.

It is stated that the TC thought the ZS comprised about 35 systems at the
start of the First Interstellar War, presumably this about all that was used
against the Terrans until much later.

Ah, you\'re making two mistakes here: 1) You\'re assuming that the lessons of
land warfare can be directly translated into space warfare. 2) You\'re
assuming that general rules apply in all cases. But history is full of
examples of battles that didn\'t follow the general rule. Belisaurus used
to _routinely_ beat forces that were 5 and 10 times the size of his own.
 ----

Assuming similar capability, 3:1 makes a good rule of thumb.
Remember this is 3:1 at the point of contact, local concentrations can be
made that outnumber the local forces of a considerably larger enemy.
Superior command, technology, experience, training, equipment, supply and
morale all act as force multipliers.

 ----

But we do have some indication that they could create viable colonies in
quite a short time. The _Imperium_ rules may give a much simplified view
of reality (Traveller reality, mind you), but it must at least correspond
to reality in _some_ degree. If it wasn\'t tuber colonies, then they must
have had some other dodge.

Robots and automated factories, for mining, processing and manufacturing.
Even today we have giant factories, mines etc that require very few people
to run.

Besides, the TC was at TL11 by the time of the First Interstellar War, which
started more than 20 years after first contact with the Vilani.

same - a very iffy \'provided\', I admit.

What we have here is an argument? dispute? misunderstanding? over what is meant
by "birth control" or "population control". Your position seems to be that,
because humans are capable of producing an average of a pregnancy every 9-12
months that they will do so. No, I realise that\'s *not* what you\'re saying, but
why would you assume that the Vilani would, in 10000 years of civilisation, be
so populous as to be spread across the entire universe in A pop planets? A
modest growth rate would be enough to give the sort of figures that I suggest,
and in 10000 years, too. You could assume that, once the Vilani reached what
they considered to be the "carrying capacity" of a world they have less and
less incentive for having large families ... and the ones that do leave the
planet and go to the frontiers to have them. With a modest population growth
rate and this sort of process, what\'s 10000 years?

I see what you mean, I just don\'t agree with it ... just like you don\'t agree
with what *I* mean. Just one of those things we\'ll both have to live with!

Refitting a ship not designed for it, considering that JDrives get bigger for
each JNo regardless of Tech Level, would be more than a refit. You\'d have to
gut the interior and rebuild it. It\'d be easier in most cases (probably in all
cases) to simply build a new ship. Weapons would, insofar as they were smaller
in overall tonnage than those they replaced, be more likely an upgrade. This is
the way most ships (military ones) do it ... better, smaller, engine, and
better weapons, smaller (or the same, overall) as the originals.

Yes. True ... but why say that TL/12 was achieved at a given date if it was
actually achieved many years before in some areas? Surely the date given would
be the date at which they achieved the first operational trials of whatever
qualified them for it. However, think that we can all agree that the Traveller
Tech Level system is, at best, a crock ... and that there are all sorts of
major holes in the chronology.

Are you seriously suggesting that GDW playtested *anything*? Just think of that
wonderful 1st Edition T:2300, the TW:2000 Boardgame "Last Battles" (or
whatever), replacing Thruster Plates with HePlar and more such "gems" of
playtesting!

Actually, these rules apply pretty much to *warfare* ... you are making the
mistake of separating the different types. Also, note that the 3:1 odds assume
troops of equal quality. There are modifiers that professional military men
should have (and sometimes do ... the ones that tend to win wars, that is!)
to allow for better performance for a whole lot of reasons.

Hark back a moment to the Falklands unpleasantness. All the "expert" reporters
(you know, the ones who think Jeep + Machine Gun = Tank!) were rabbiting on
about how the Argentinians were going to crush the Brits simply because they
had more warm bodies on the wet soggy ground than the Brits were sending after
them. Almost nobody in the media, nor any of their "expert" consultants
predicted any better ... but it was obvious, thinking about it, that the Brits
would win (assuming they got ashore which, in itself, was not necessarily as
uncertain as all the media assumed). I (modest "aw shucks") predicted a British
win beforehand ... why? Well, the Brits had regular troops; they had a regular
and well trained officer corps; the Argies had mostly conscript troops who
really didn\'t want to be there *at all*, and their officer corps was more at
home rounding up helpless streetkids and "disappearing" them than anything
approaching actual combat. Those, and other, factors, meant that, although the
Brits did not have 3:1 odds in *numbers*, they actually *did* have 3:1 odds.

However, and a *big* caveat here, *because* of their lack of actual warm bodies
they found that, on a number of occasions, they were brought to within a
hairsbreadth of a possible defeat (or a *major* setback) simply because they
lost more of said warm bodies than they could afford to. With the big odds the
Terrans were facing, whatever they were, they could similarly ill-afford any
setback ... and the numbers in favour of the Vilani are so overwhelming, even
at the end, that unless they were the equivalent of the Iraqui army, there must
have been some other explanation. Better morale wouldn\'t have been enough in
and of itself, though it no doubt helped!

I know we\'re not going to agree on it ... how can we when the canon is so
sketchy?! We\'ll just have to wait for the Interstellar Wars Milieu book to
settle the matter once and for all ... and let\'s let Marc Miller know that we
want all those loose ends tied up!

I think I have to disagree with this.  3:1 does not apply as clearly to naval
warfare at all.  The 3:1 rule of thumb takes into account an entrenched enemy,
defensive positions, and a lot of other things that don\'t apply to navies.
Also, while keeping a reserve makes sense in land warfare, it usually doesn\'t
at sea, as greater mass on the line makes a large difference and reserve
forces rarely are able to commit to battle.  [Anyone interested in this
discussion should read _Fleet Tactics_ by Capt. Wayne P. Hughes (USN, Ret.).
The techniques he uses to analyze surface combat and aircraft carrier tactics
could easily be used to analyze Traveller space combat as well.]

This is true in real war -- in board wargames, this usually gets abstracted
into "combat factors", so actual numbers of counters/units is of lesser
relevance.

Regarding the Falklands, if I recall a considerable number of experts were
wondering what would happen if the Argentines seriously hit the British
carrier.  They would have been between a rock and a hard place, and even if
the US was prepared to \'loan\' the Brits a jeep carrier (as reported), it still
would have set them back a ways, as \'borrowing\' a carrier is NOT like renting
a car. In such a circumstance, the continued support of the British public
would by no means have been certain.

Afraid you\'re a bit confused.

Leap *days* are added to keep the calendar in synch with the "tropical
year" (time between the sun reaching the "tropic of capricorn" and the
next time it reaches it). This is one of *several* "solar years" of
differing lengths. We use this one for the calendar because it\'s what
counts with respect to the seasons.

Leap *seconds* are added to keep Universal Time (UT or UT0), which is
based on atomic clocks, in synch with the solar *day*. As the earth is
slowing down, every year or so we have to add a leap second.

Since there are 86400 seconds in a day, you\'d have to add an *awful*
lot of them to correct the the accumulated *calendar* error of half a
day or so that will have accumulated by 3000 AD.

Someone has sent me the rules for a number of calendars used in
Traveller. I\'ll be going over them. But I\'ll *still* need corresponding
dates to synchronize them.

If somebody has the original GDW _Solomani_ supplement, I think an actual
*date* for Holiday, Year Zero was printed in a section on history.  Does
anyone know this?

One possibility is that the Imperial year and Solomani/Gregorian year are
not linked.  Assuming that they use the same measurements of time, then
by 1110, the Imperial calendar has slid back 274 days since Cleon I.  The
Imperium really won\'t care about matching the calendar to the seasons of
any one planet, even Earth, anyway.

Another possible solution is to make Holiday a permanent "leap day" by
making it about six hours longer than the normal day....

The timeline is misleading.  There is a clear statement that the Terrans had
jump-3 in the 8th Interstellar War or so, well before the date given for
their acquisition of tech-12 in MegaTraveller.  My personal opinion is that
the dates in Referee\'s Companion are rough guidelines, and not absolutely
trustworthy for achievement tech levels in specific fields.

Hi,

The thing that always annoyed me with COACC (the MT aircraft design rules)
is the names of the planes.

The book says that the Imperium names their planes after Terran cities.
Why would the Imperium name planes after cities on the homeworld of
one of their chief enemies.  Another thing, is that most people wouldn\'t
even know the names of cities on Terra, in real life, most people don\'t
know alot of cities in other countries.  Also I just can\'t see my players
being worried about being attacked by a San Diego Fighter plane.
So I came up with alternative names for the planes.  Some are better than
others, I don\'t know how much use this is to anyone, but I was typing
it up for my own use, so I figured I\'d send along a copy to the
mailing list.

Uh, Phil, could you _please_ try to be less inflamatory?  Of course GDW
playtested their games.  (I remember talking to Loren about it.)  You,
personally, may dislike the game, or you may have found a hole in it, but
that doesn\'t mean that they didn\'t playtest the game.

For an example I\'ll use the Chaosium game Credo (which I recommend, by the
way).  I enjoy playing it, but we eventually found a tactic that virtually
ensures a win if one person follows it, but leads to a long and boring game
if everyone uses it.  (Rather like epee fencing.)  Now, if you played Credo
as I suspect its designers did, you wouldn\'t have tried that tactic, because
it runs contrary to the entire spirit of the game!  But it is allowed by the
rules.  So we made a couple of house rules that invalidated the tactic and
made for a better game.

One thing I have noticed is that American games tend to have detailed rules,
and American gamers tend to use them literally (rules lawyers).  British
games have less detailed rules, and British players tend to interpret them
with an eye on the spirit of the game.  Compare soem Avalon Hill rereleases
of British games for an example.  Loren and Frank are both gamers in the
British style - in that they view the rules as being flexible and subject to
interpretation.  (Just read their design notes, or talk to them at a
convention.)

The 3:1 rule is a pretty good guideline, but its hardly a concrete rule.  You
need to remember that it does not apply to numbers of soldiers, but to a
non-real number we can call Force Level.    Force Level is a variable that
depends on the number of weapons employed, the Firepower (damage, penetration
and rate of fire), the Flexibility (speed,  mobility,
command/control/communications and area of weapon effect) and the Hardness
(fortifications, body armor, morale) of a body of troops and its gear.  One sid
e is generally the defender, and usually the defender has some sort of
preparation time to dig in or order their forces in the most logical fashion
available.    This lets the defender potentially increase his level of
Flexibility and/or Hardness.

As for the Falklands, the British were very careful to maintain a LOCAL
superiority in their attacks; they carefully concentrated their forces at the
point of attack, and used air support and artillery both as force multipliers
for the attack and to prevent Argentine reinforcements from getting to the
battle at the appropriate time.  Even then, the Brits did not have an easy time
of it, but they used their numbers and resources intelligently and managed to
win.    The sea battle, where things were generally more evenly weighted, was
fairly nasty for both sides; I can\'t imagine how the Royal Navy would have
bounced back from a major carrier hit (sinking or forcing the carrier to
retire).

Its been a long time since I studied Ancient Warfare (err, Ancient Human, not
Droyne), but I belive the same was true of Belisarius.  He lacked the luxury of
air support, but I recall that he was flexible enough to redirect his heavy
assault forces against the less well-defended parts of the enemy\'s line,
disrupting their forces and leading to his victory.  A large but disorganized
force might have a high Firepower value, but would be very weak in terms of
Flexibility and Hardness.

Of course, if all else is equal, I would want to be on the side with the 3:1
advantage.  There is a certain element of momentum that large numbers of troops
can give you, but only if you use them correctly and don\'t scatter them around
in a useless manner.  This would be true in any form of warfare; land, sea, air
or space.

One point to bear in mind is that the 100 diameter limit applies to
any body in "range", not just the target world. So if you jump to
Orbit 0 the chances are you\'ll be within 100 diameters of the central
star, so standby for a misjump. In practice the 100 stellar diameter
limit makes in system jumps risky closer than about orbit 3.

At least that\'s the way I play it........

There\'s a brilliant Fred Hoyle SF novel that\'s based around this

action is set in SW Ireland in the present and far far future.

    'body' => 'Introduction

Greetings, fellow Travellers.  I haven\'t contributed to the discussions
here prior to now.  in fact, I only subscribed to the Traveller and XBoat
mailing lists a couple of weeks ago.  I\'m a newcomer to your group and that
means I should introduce myself.  But how do I go about doing that?  What
can be said other than, "I\'m one of you?"  And, really, that is
self-evident.  I wouldn\'t be here if I wasn\'t "one of you."

Perhaps a quick biography is in order.  I began role-playing in November
of 1981 when my parents bought me the D&D Basic and Expert rules sets.
It took me until the summer of 1983 before I found the One True RPG For
Me:  Traveller.  Since then I have tried dozens of RPG systems, only to
ultimately return to Traveller (although I do keep up on the Hero System
rules as well).

In the last couple of years I have sold most of the thirty-six or so game
systems I have owned.  I kept only Classic Traveler, Hero System, and
James Bond 007.  Although I enjoy the other two, I have found Traveller
to be the best system for the type of role-playing I enjoy.  Oh, I should
mentin that in all my role-playing experience, with all of those games, I
have been the GM at least 90% of the time.  I should also mention that
when I say, "Traveller," I mean what is sometimes called Classic
Traveller (everything from th Little Black Books to the Traveller Book to
the two-book rule system known as Starter Traveller).

What of MegaTraveller and The New Era?  I purchased the entire
MegaTraveller system, but I didn\'t enjoy playing it as much as I had the
old rules system.  As for The New Era, I carefully perused it in the games
store and decided not to buy it.  I consider TNE an abomination - a
raping and pludering of a game that was once great.  That is all I will
say on those matters, as it is not my purpose to start a flame war.

Also within the last couple of years, I have begun filling in the gaps in
my Traveller collection.  Only in that time did I acquire the 1977
original edition, the Traveller Book, and many of the third-party
products.  There are still quite a number of Traveller products that I
hope to find someday.

What about this new Traveller edition that Far Future and Imperium Games
will be producing?  I ask myself, Is it really necessary to make yet
another rules change?  The game has been changed twice, and both times it
has suffered.  Will another change somehow make it better than the
original?  The evidence suggests that is not the case.


Imperium Games

Since I was concerned about the fate of the Traveller system, I called Ken
Whitman of Imperium Games.  I was quite impressed with Ken personally.  He
is as enthusiastic about the Traveller system as I am.

After getting amenities out of the way (including asking to be put on
their mailing list), one of my first quesions to Ken was, "What benefit
will I, as the owner of an almost-complete collection of the original
Traveller rules, get from buying this new system?"  He began by telling
me that the new system represented some incremental improvements that were
made in light of all the years of role-playing experience that Marc
Miller has.  But he startled me when he went on to say that it is not
necessary for me to purchase the new rules system.  He said that I would
be able to follow along with the rest of the Traveller community if I just
purchase the Milieu and Adventure products and use the original rules
system!

Even so, he did emphasize the benefits of the new rules, such as a task
system, complete listings of equipment, starships, and space ships, and
the new psionics rules.  Although I felt really good about the new
products in general after talking to Ken, I still felt some misgiving.
Essentially, I was thinking to myself, "Yeah, but why mess wih a good
thing?  If it ain\'t broke . . ."


Traveller Rules

Recently, I was going through the various editions of th Classic Traveller
rules, and I noted something new to me:  the original game has been
changed in many ways.  I had assumed that the Traveller system has been
through two changes (with a third on the way): from Traveller to
MegaTraveller, then from MegaTraveller to Traveller: The New Era.  In
fact, those two retitlings merely mark the major changes the system has
undergone.  From 1977, when the game was introduced, to the year
MegaTraveller was released, the basic Traveller rules underwent many changes.

For example, the Starter Traveller two-book rules set contains no
provision for experience, while the other versions (each edition of the
three-book basic rules set and the hardcover Traveller Book) do contain a
concise set of rules for character advancement.

Another difference between the rules sets is the amount of damage the
various weapons do.  In the original, three-book edition, the weapons had
various DM\'s.  For intance, the Body Pistol did 3D-8 damage.  In later
editions, there were no such DM\'s.  Thus, the Body Pistol in Starter
Traveller does 3D.

Additionally, the Tech Level Table was substantially expanded from the
Little Black Books to the Starter Traveller/Traveller Book editions.  In
those later editions, a listing of Terran equivalent dates was provided,
as well as additional detail on the various technologies available at
each Tech Level.  None of this was in the original.

While the lack of an Experience section in the Starter Traveller rules book
can be seen as an error of omission, the change in weapon damages can not
be so easily dismissed.  The weapon damage rules were probably changed in
order to simplify combat.  The changes to the Tech Level Table were almost
certainly introduced in order to provide players and referees with a
better grasp of the different tech levels.

What all this means is that even the core rules of Classic Traveller,
which I hold up as the prime example of excellence in a role-playing
system, is not consistent among its own various incarnations.  It grew
and changed in several small ways.


Traveller in the Not-Very-Far Future

Maybe changing Traveller isn\'t a bad thing.  At least, it doesn\'t have to
be a bad thing.  If th rules are changed once in a while, in light of new
experience, perhaps the result is good.  The changes I detailed above
fall into that category.  If Mr. Miller and Imperium Games are planning on
doing something similar, then perhaps I will buy the new rules set.

When I think of the new system coming out, I still feel a bit of
apprehension, but also some excitement.  Maybe the best edition of
Traveller is yet to come.

According to the \'Craft Design Errata\' in \'the Travellers\' Digest\' #13, =
p. 48, the correct values are:

The columns are as below
UCP   TL   POWER   VOLUME   WT   MCR

All power column entries for both Meson Screens and optimized Meson =
Screen Packs are too high by a factor of 10 - still according to the =
above mentioned errata.

By the way, why do you need to know craft design rules for vessels over =

My position is that both situations are possible. I won\'t claim that they are
equally likely, but they are, at least, both possible. Since the one seems to
contradict certain canonical evidence and the other dosen\'t, I submit that the
one that dosen\'t contradict canon should be preferred to the one that does.

Face it, whenever you build up a background the way the Traveller background
was build, the first pieces will look nice and likely; but the odd bits
needed to fit in _between_ those pieces can have very odd shapes indeed.

You may think so, but the rules dosen\'t agree with you. Tearing out one
engine and putting in another, even a bigger one, is considered a major
refit and takes 1/4 the normal time to accomplish.

No, I\'m suggesting that they didn\'t. However, since I don\'t _know_ for sure

I think you\'re wrong. Napoleonic sea warfare certainly dosen\'t follow that
rule. (Due to the weakness to raking fire imposed by ship designs, a second
ship, even one of markedly less size than the principals, would increase the
chances of success markedely. It was even considered possible for three
frigates to deal with a ship-of-the-line (usually frigates were not expected
to mess with ships-of-the-line); mind you, the two of them could expect a
very big butcher\'s bill).

Uh, Phil, could you _please_ try to be less inflamatory?  Of course GDW
playtested their games.  (I remember talking to Loren about it.)  You,
personally, may dislike the game, or you may have found a hole in it, but
that doesn\'t mean that they didn\'t playtest the game.

For an example I\'ll use the Chaosium game Credo (which I recommend, by the
way).  I enjoy playing it, but we eventually found a tactic that virtually
ensures a win if one person follows it, but leads to a long and boring game
if everyone uses it.  (Rather like epee fencing.)  Now, if you played Credo
as I suspect its designers did, you wouldn\'t have tried that tactic, because
it runs contrary to the entire spirit of the game!  But it is allowed by the
rules.  So we made a couple of house rules that invalidated the tactic and
made for a better game.

One thing I have noticed is that American games tend to have detailed rules,
and American gamers tend to use them literally (rules lawyers).  British
games have less detailed rules, and British players tend to interpret them
with an eye on the spirit of the game.  Compare soem Avalon Hill rereleases
of British games for an example.  Loren and Frank are both gamers in the
British style - in that they view the rules as being flexible and subject to
interpretation.  (Just read their design notes, or talk to them at a
convention.)

The 3:1 rule is a pretty good guideline, but its hardly a concrete rule.  You
need to remember that it does not apply to numbers of soldiers, but to a
non-real number we can call Force Level.    Force Level is a variable that
depends on the number of weapons employed, the Firepower (damage, penetration
and rate of fire), the Flexibility (speed,  mobility,
command/control/communications and area of weapon effect) and the Hardness
(fortifications, body armor, morale) of a body of troops and its gear.  One sid
e is generally the defender, and usually the defender has some sort of
preparation time to dig in or order their forces in the most logical fashion
available.    This lets the defender potentially increase his level of
Flexibility and/or Hardness.

As for the Falklands, the British were very careful to maintain a LOCAL
superiority in their attacks; they carefully concentrated their forces at the
point of attack, and used air support and artillery both as force multipliers
for the attack and to prevent Argentine reinforcements from getting to the
battle at the appropriate time.  Even then, the Brits did not have an easy time
of it, but they used their numbers and resources intelligently and managed to
win.    The sea battle, where things were generally more evenly weighted, was
fairly nasty for both sides; I can\'t imagine how the Royal Navy would have
bounced back from a major carrier hit (sinking or forcing the carrier to
retire).

Its been a long time since I studied Ancient Warfare (err, Ancient Human, not
Droyne), but I belive the same was true of Belisarius.  He lacked the luxury of
air support, but I recall that he was flexible enough to redirect his heavy
assault forces against the less well-defended parts of the enemy\'s line,
disrupting their forces and leading to his victory.  A large but disorganized
force might have a high Firepower value, but would be very weak in terms of
Flexibility and Hardness.

Of course, if all else is equal, I would want to be on the side with the 3:1
advantage.  There is a certain element of momentum that large numbers of troops
can give you, but only if you use them correctly and don\'t scatter them around
in a useless manner.  This would be true in any form of warfare; land, sea, air
or space.

One point to bear in mind is that the 100 diameter limit applies to
any body in "range", not just the target world. So if you jump to
Orbit 0 the chances are you\'ll be within 100 diameters of the central
star, so standby for a misjump. In practice the 100 stellar diameter
limit makes in system jumps risky closer than about orbit 3.

At least that\'s the way I play it........

There\'s a brilliant Fred Hoyle SF novel that\'s based around this
handedness stuff. I think it\'s called Ossian\'s Ride and most of the
action is set in SW Ireland in the present and far far future.

Greetings, fellow Travellers.  I haven\'t contributed to the discussions
here prior to now.  in fact, I only subscribed to the Traveller and XBoat
mailing lists a couple of weeks ago.  I\'m a newcomer to your group and that
means I should introduce myself.  But how do I go about doing that?  What
can be said other than, "I\'m one of you?"  And, really, that is
self-evident.  I wouldn\'t be here if I wasn\'t "one of you."

Perhaps a quick biography is in order.  I began role-playing in November
of 1981 when my parents bought me the D&D Basic and Expert rules sets.
It took me until the summer of 1983 before I found the One True RPG For
Me:  Traveller.  Since then I have tried dozens of RPG systems, only to
ultimately return to Traveller (although I do keep up on the Hero System
rules as well).

In the last couple of years I have sold most of the thirty-six or so game
systems I have owned.  I kept only Classic Traveler, Hero System, and
James Bond 007.  Although I enjoy the other two, I have found Traveller
to be the best system for the type of role-playing I enjoy.  Oh, I should
mentin that in all my role-playing experience, with all of those games, I
have been the GM at least 90% of the time.  I should also mention that
when I say, "Traveller," I mean what is sometimes called Classic
Traveller (everything from th Little Black Books to the Traveller Book to
the two-book rule system known as Starter Traveller).

What of MegaTraveller and The New Era?  I purchased the entire
MegaTraveller system, but I didn\'t enjoy playing it as much as I had the
old rules system.  As for The New Era, I carefully perused it in the games
store and decided not to buy it.  I consider TNE an abomination - a
raping and pludering of a game that was once great.  That is all I will
say on those matters, as it is not my purpose to start a flame war.

Also within the last couple of years, I have begun filling in the gaps in
my Traveller collection.  Only in that time did I acquire the 1977
original edition, the Traveller Book, and many of the third-party
products.  There are still quite a number of Traveller products that I
hope to find someday.

What about this new Traveller edition that Far Future and Imperium Games
will be producing?  I ask myself, Is it really necessary to make yet
another rules change?  The game has been changed twice, and both times it
has suffered.  Will another change somehow make it better than the
original?  The evidence suggests that is not the case.


Imperium Games

Since I was concerned about the fate of the Traveller system, I called Ken
Whitman of Imperium Games.  I was quite impressed with Ken personally.  He
is as enthusiastic about the Traveller system as I am.

After getting amenities out of the way (including asking to be put on
their mailing list), one of my first quesions to Ken was, "What benefit
will I, as the owner of an almost-complete collection of the original
Traveller rules, get from buying this new system?"  He began by telling
me that the new system represented some incremental improvements that were
made in light of all the years of role-playing experience that Marc
Miller has.  But he startled me when he went on to say that it is not
necessary for me to purchase the new rules system.  He said that I would
be able to follow along with the rest of the Traveller community if I just
purchase the Milieu and Adventure products and use the original rules
system!

Even so, he did emphasize the benefits of the new rules, such as a task
system, complete listings of equipment, starships, and space ships, and
the new psionics rules.  Although I felt really good about the new
products in general after talking to Ken, I still felt some misgiving.
Essentially, I was thinking to myself, "Yeah, but why mess wih a good
thing?  If it ain\'t broke . . ."


Traveller Rules

Recently, I was going through the various editions of th Classic Traveller
rules, and I noted something new to me:  the original game has been
changed in many ways.  I had assumed that the Traveller system has been
through two changes (with a third on the way): from Traveller to
MegaTraveller, then from MegaTraveller to Traveller: The New Era.  In
fact, those two retitlings merely mark the major changes the system has
undergone.  From 1977, when the game was introduced, to the year
MegaTraveller was released, the basic Traveller rules underwent many changes.

For example, the Starter Traveller two-book rules set contains no
provision for experience, while the other versions (each edition of the
three-book basic rules set and the hardcover Traveller Book) do contain a
concise set of rules for character advancement.

Another difference between the rules sets is the amount of damage the
various weapons do.  In the original, three-book edition, the weapons had
various DM\'s.  For intance, the Body Pistol did 3D-8 damage.  In later
editions, there were no such DM\'s.  Thus, the Body Pistol in Starter
Traveller does 3D.

Additionally, the Tech Level Table was substantially expanded from the
Little Black Books to the Starter Traveller/Traveller Book editions.  In
those later editions, a listing of Terran equivalent dates was provided,
as well as additional detail on the various technologies available at
each Tech Level.  None of this was in the original.

While the lack of an Experience section in the Starter Traveller rules book
can be seen as an error of omission, the change in weapon damages can not
be so easily dismissed.  The weapon damage rules were probably changed in
order to simplify combat.  The changes to the Tech Level Table were almost
certainly introduced in order to provide players and referees with a
better grasp of the different tech levels.

What all this means is that even the core rules of Classic Traveller,
which I hold up as the prime example of excellence in a role-playing
system, is not consistent among its own various incarnations.  It grew
and changed in several small ways.


Traveller in the Not-Very-Far Future

Maybe changing Traveller isn\'t a bad thing.  At least, it doesn\'t have to
be a bad thing.  If th rules are changed once in a while, in light of new
experience, perhaps the result is good.  The changes I detailed above
fall into that category.  If Mr. Miller and Imperium Games are planning on
doing something similar, then perhaps I will buy the new rules set.

When I think of the new system coming out, I still feel a bit of
apprehension, but also some excitement.  Maybe the best edition of
Traveller is yet to come.

According to the \'Craft Design Errata\' in \'the Travellers\' Digest\' #13, =
p. 48, the correct values are:

The columns are as below
UCP   TL   POWER   VOLUME   WT   MCR
A        16        0.150     325              310    50
B        17        0.165     375              340     60
C        18        0.180     435              390     70
D       19         0.195      485              460     80
E        20        0.210       540              560     90
F        21        0.225       595              640     100

All power column entries for both Meson Screens and optimized Meson =
Screen Packs are too high by a factor of 10 - still according to the =
above mentioned errata.

By the way, why do you need to know craft design rules for vessels over =
TL15 (especially TL 21)?

Hope this helps

Yes, that\'s it exactly.

My position is that both situations are possible. I won\'t claim that they are
equally likely, but they are, at least, both possible. Since the one seems to
contradict certain canonical evidence and the other dosen\'t, I submit that the
one that dosen\'t contradict canon should be preferred to the one that does.

Face it, whenever you build up a background the way the Traveller background
was build, the first pieces will look nice and likely; but the odd bits
needed to fit in _between_ those pieces can have very odd shapes indeed.

You may think so, but the rules dosen\'t agree with you. Tearing out one
engine and putting in another, even a bigger one, is considered a major
refit and takes 1/4 the normal time to accomplish.

No, I\'m suggesting that they didn\'t. However, since I don\'t _know_ for sure

I think you\'re wrong. Napoleonic sea warfare certainly dosen\'t follow that
rule. (Due to the weakness to raking fire imposed by ship designs, a second
ship, even one of markedly less size than the principals, would increase the
chances of success markedely. It was even considered possible for three
frigates to deal with a ship-of-the-line (usually frigates were not expected
to mess with ships-of-the-line); mind you, the two of them could expect a
very big butcher\'s bill).

I\'m new to this Traveller mailing list, and I\'ve never checked in
on the AD&D areas, but I have a good deal of online experience so I will
conjecture why the Traveller community is so close-knit:  We\'re a minority.
AD&D players are a dime-a-dozen.  Players of the latest fad games
such as the White Wolf line and the various card games are, at least for
now, almost as ubiquitous.   But Traveller players are few and far
between in comparison.
Further, any Classic- or MegaTraveller player who has stuck it
out this long obviously loves the system for what it is, not because it\'s
a popular hit.
So, our love for this game is deep and abiding.  We\'ve found
something great, and we know it.  Being able to talk to others who share
our passion is something to be treasured, and we do.

Call or write your congressperson and tell them to increase
funding for space exploration, or we may never get that far. :(

Just let me de-lurk for a sec here...
then don\'t you find it ironic that the majority of battles have been won by
the numerically INFERIOR force?  THAT might suggest that numbers AREN\'T the
primary factor we take them to be.

I think that info comes from "Numbers, Predictions, and War" but if you need

Remember, the rule of thumb says that the _attacker_ needs at least 3:1 to
win.

I would be very interested in seeing a citation that claimed that the majority
of _attackers_ win at odds worse than 3:1.  If the source claims that the
majority of _defenders_ win in battles where the attacker has less than 3:1,
it would of course support the 3:1 rule of thumb.

I\'ve always seen the 3-1 rule of thumb applied to tactical situations (and
usually relatively direct approaches, too). At a strategic level, the issue
isn\'t so much overall superiority but the ability to create local
superiority at the important sectors of the battlefield.

Even if the Vilani were vastly superior to the Terrans in overall numbers,
the Terrans would have been able to achieve 3-1 (and much higher than 3-1)
superiority at decisive locations. A good example of this principle is the
German attack on France in May 1940. The Germans were marginally inferior
in both numbers and technology; they succeeded by concentrating their
forces against small areas of the Allied front (if I remember correctly,
they reached something like 12-1 or 15-1 along the most vital sector of the
Meuse crossing).

Heh.  Complaining is natural, and I admit I\'m wont to do it as
well.  However, when it comes to RPG\'s I find that Traveller and I have a
perfect fit.
On that oft-discussed continuum between playability and realism,
perhaps Traveller isn\'t as far on the realism side as some (many?) would
like it to be.  I like where it is, though.  While I don\'t find
total-fantasy games to be much fun (ie, "Toon"), I definitely like my
games to be more playable than realistic.  I want my combat system to be
deadly and quick - Traveller gives me that.  Often after the first round,
people are down and unconcious.  I like that - it gives the players
something to think about before turning the game into a hack \'n slash
(er, lase \'n slash?) orgy.  And I like the fact that the best possible
character and the average character, in terms of characteristics
(Traveller\'s "hit points"), are not that far apart.  Someone who is FFF
vs. a 777 isn\'t as sure of winning, given equal weaponry and armor, as
someone who is AD&D Level 25 vs. someone who is, say, Level 12.  And no
matter what, the Traveller combat will take much less time than the AD&D
one (given that all four are using conventional weaponry as opposed to
magic).
In fact, I think those things are pretty realistic.  The space
travel is realistic as well, other than the fact that we haven\'t
discovered anything like Hyperspace and Jump Drives.
Sure, a lot of the things I consider to be background material,
such as the economics of the universe, are rather unrealistic.  But that
doesn\'t bother me.  I wouldn\'t have any more fun with the game if the
economic system was totally realistic.
This is not to say that those who long for a perfectly realistic
game should be barred from sharing their opinions - especially if they
come up with alternative systems that will bring more realism to the
game.  But, perhaps we can each become too obsessed with picking nits.

    'body' => 'Fellow Travellers,

The following is from my "Additional Rules Booklet" for
Traveller, which I printed for myself using a DTP system (ie, it was for
personal use, not for sale).  The booklet is a collection of house rules
that have been found to work in my campaigns.  Everything from prices for
items not mentioned in the books to rules such as the on below to new
character classes are included in it.
I will, from time to time, submit some of the material from that
booklet to this mailing list.  Please feel free to use, copy, critique,
and/or change these rules.  If you reproduce them, however, please give
me credit.


Character Improvement in Traveller

The basic Traveller system provides very limited rules by which
characters may improve themselves.  Book 2 outlines these rules, but it
requires eight years of a character\'s life in order to permanently gain
one skill level.  That is a realistic system, but it is not one whih
increases enjoyment of the game.
The following is an additional system by which a character may
improve himself during the course of his adventures.  It has been found
to increase the excitement in adventures by encouraging daring and risky
acts on th part of player characters.  This system provides rules for
gaining new skills as well as improving current ones.  It is meant as an
addition to the Book 2 rules, not as a replacement.

Gaining New Skills

In order to gain a new skill, a character must successfully
resolve a situation that would require that skill during the course of an
adventure.  If this occurs, at the end of the adventure the referee
should allow the player to roll 11+ for a skill gain, with a positive DM
of 1/2 the value of the related skill (round fractions down).  When more
than one skill is related to the skill to be gained, only the one at the
highest level is used.
In th case of weapons skill, a successful roll will yield a skill
of 1.  In all other instances,  skill level of 0 will be recieved.  In
either case, subsequent skill increases can be attained using the rules
outlined below, or through the course of study given in Book 2.
It is suggested that Jack-of-all-Trades skill not be used as a
"related" skill, as the knowledge granted by J-o-T is not great enough to
aid i the gaining of a new skill.
Example:  Jyond, an ex-marine who has no survival skill, has just
completed an adventure wherein he had to live off the land while stranded
on an uncivilized world for an extended period.  While his skill of
Hunting-3 helped to some degree by giving him meat, he also had to find
sources of water and edible vegetation.  Through good judgement and some
luck, Jyond survived this ordeal.
After the adventure is over and Jyond has been rescued, the
referee allows Jyond\'s player to roll 11+ with a DM of +1 for his Hunting
skill (3/2 = 1.5, rounded down to 1).  The player rolls 4 and 6, plus the
DM of 1, yielding 11. Jyond now has Survival-0.

Improving Current Skills

In order to increase the level of skill a character has, the
skill must be successfully used during the adventure in such a way that
it would cause the skill to be increased.  High-risk uses of the skill as
well as using it in original ways are both examples of this.  For
instance, repairing an ATV while under fire as the enemy steadily
advances (Mechanical skill); piloting an air/raft through twisting
ravines to avoid radar detection (Air/Raft skill); using a revolver to
fire at a cable, severing it and dropping 10 tons of cargo on the enemy
group are all valid specific instances wherein a skill may be increased.
Typically, two conditions must be met: first, the task must be
relatively difficult; second, success must have a great impact on the
adventure.  In the example above, the referee might have imposed a DM of
-4 to the roll for hittin th cable by firing the revolver.  Assuming the
character has a skill of Revolver-2, this would reqire a roll of 10 or
more on two dice for success.  This is hardly a roll on which to pin the
hopes of a band of adventurers!  But, if all goes well, the adventurers
will have gained a significant advantage (and the story will be that much
more exciting!).
The roll for increasing a skill is 7+, with a negative DM of the
current skill level.  In our example above, the player would have to roll
9 or more on two dice to increas his Revolver skill level to 3.  As you
can see, this system does not allow for skill increases beyond level 6.
If a character wishes to gain higher skill levels, he or she must follow
the rules outlined in Book 2.

Using the Skill Improvement System

Referees and players should keep in mind that a character may
never have more skill levels than the sum of his intelligence and
education characteristics.  This puts a restraint on which skills players
attempt to improve or add.  Because of this, players may of course choose
not to attempt skill improvement or gain in some intances.  The referee
will determine whether thecharacter may gain a skill as a result of his
actions, but the player decides whether to use that opportunity.  Use of
the above system, in conjunction with the system given in Book 2 of the
Traveller rules, will create a more dynamic and exciting universe for the
players and the referee.

often, though, numbers are important. The World Wars were rather unusual (well,
maybe not, they just stick in my mind) in that the combatants did not have any
great numerical superiority overall one compared to the other ... certainly
not of the 3:1 order. However, through careful generalship the side that
managed to attack the other with 3:1 or greater (often much greater!) odds *at
one point* was the one that could be regarded as "winning". The Germans did
this initially ... outnumbered (forex) in Russia in *overall* terms they
managed to have the numbers concentrated where they were needed and so
(initially) swept all before them. Unfortunately, they just didn\'t have the
oomph needed to win (actually, I should say *fortunately* here!) overall.

I believe that I read somewhere (it may have been from Dupuy\'s work, or someone
who quoted it) that small armies tend to be disproportionately better (or
worse) than large armies simply because one outstanding individual can have a
great and direct impact on them in a way that simply is not possible in the
mass citizen armies of the 20th century. So, in ancient times, a small army
led by a skilled and charismatic general *could* defeat a large army led by a
poor general qith some ease ... but it was always on a knife edge even then!

Read the Anabasis for some idea of the problems ... and think how close
Alexander came on a number of occasions. If the Greek mercenary commander for
the King of Kings had been given his head on at least one of the battles, there
is a good chance that Alex would have been minced, if not defeated outright.
Unfortunately, stupider heads prevailed ... or, again, should I say
"fortunately" (I rather like having the right to vote and other similar
freedoms).

Sure, 3:1 is a rule of thumb, but it\'s one that\'s proven itself over the
milennia.

We were talking in the staffroom at school the other day and, basically, were
talking over some of the more recent changes that our glorious leaders have
applied to us ... and which we don\'t think are such a wonderful idea. However,
that\'s neither here nor there ... one of the "expert" consultants the school
hired to convince us with razzle dazzle came up with this gem (all too common
these days) -

The children we teach now will change jobs at least three times in their
working lives, and will be working at jobs that have not even been invented yet

At the time I thought, "what a load of garbage" ... but, hey, I like an easy
life just like most people, and arguing against the "wave of the future" (or
what our beloved leadership have *decided* is the "wave of the future") is
*not* something that I bother to do very often. Pick battles you can win, I
say.

Anyhow, how is this related to Traveller?

Well, the statement is, at best, dubious ... I\'ll tell you right now, that most
people (kids) I teach now are going to do the same job for most, and probably
all, of their working lives, just as they do now. There\'ll still be plumbers,
carpenters, office workers, lawyers, doctors etc. ... at least in the next
couple of generations. As for the "jobs that haven\'t been invented yet" ...
well, that\'s a bit more believable ... but I reckon it may be on shaky ground
as well ... sure, new technologies give rise to some new jobs, and result in
others being rendered obsolete ... but how many people will end up doing those
jobs, and will they really be "new" or simply "new ways of doing the same old
things"?

Like, for example, the introduction of the mouldboard plough, horse collar, and
three field rotation system revolutionised agriculture in the Middle Ages. But
there were still farmers ... sure they were using tech that hadn\'t been around
when they were young, but, so what? More *productive* farmers, sure.

Anyway, think about this ... in the 53rd Century (or whatever ... I haven\'t
got my Referee\'s Comapnion handy, <grin>), what sort of jobs will people be
doing? What sort of jobs will be obsolete? What "new" jobs will exist.

Obviously (I think it\'s obvious, anyway) there\'ll be (relatively speaking)
almost no-one working in "heavy industry" anymore ... as it\'ll be even more
heavily roboticised than it is now. So, more people will be working in service
industries ... but a lot of that can be robot assisted as well ... so there
is bound to be some sort of new careers that people will be able to follow.

One thing that I can think of, very retro, is that with a highly mechanised
and roboticised society, there may well be a *big* market for personal servants
- just to show that you are filthy rich enough to afford them!

Information workers? Well, if you allow for the increasingly sophisticated
computers that even the crappy tech of Traveller allows for, then there may
not be the jobs in that area that we might think! Of course, if you think about
it, "information worker" is merely a different way of saying "office worker"
or, if you get down to tin-tacks, a "clerk".

Plumbers? Yep! Carpenters? Yes, again, for the prestige value of having
human-made work rather than robotically produced stuff. Chefs? yes!

So, what are *your* ideas? I\'d be interested to hear!

I think it is more than being a simple minority.  It has, IMHO, something to do
with the game itself.  D&D (and all fantasy games) have one thing going for them
that is a lot harder to come by in a sci-fi setting, explainability thru magic.

The question that arises in any game is "how did you do that?".  With a fantasy
game you can always use magic as a copout.  With a sci-fi setting you *can* use
hi-tech to replace magic as your cop - out, but the feeling is that tech has to
conform in at least some minor way to what we know of science.  That is what
makes it different, because we spend out time asking ourselves how does it
work and we keep each other honest.  Look at this mail list.  I would venture to
say that 85% of the stuff that gets distributed is relevant to answering
that question
in one form or another.

I have stuck it out because I bought into the system in \'77 (Origins 77, for
those
of you that were there) and because as a RPG system it is still one of the best.
I dislike many aspects of the system and I feel free to change them in my
campaign
just as I do with the history (Virus, what Virus?).

Heh.  Remember Gary Gygax\' dire warnings to those who would dare
fiddle with the Official AD&D System?   Published right in the AD&D DMG.
Amazing.
Thankfully, Marc Miller never felt the need to make such an
attempt at preserving the "purity" of the Traveller system at the expense
of some of his customer\'s outlets for creativity.
Actually, I have always felt that Traveller welcomes changes to
its system.  Right from the start, I kept a notebook of rules that we
made up as we went along, on an as-needed basis.  In later sessions we
would refine those rules, and add others.  Thus we got, for instance, a
fun rule for fishing, and what we consider to be an elegant system of NPC
physical description generation, and many more such rules - all tailored
to our style of role-play.
As you said, Traveller is still one of the best role-playing
systems around.  But that doesn\'t mean we can\'t improve upon it so that
it fills the needs of our specific campaigns.
I think that we often get way too attached to published
material.  While I have changed quite a lot of rules in my day, I never
did bother to generate my own universe for traveller - I just used the
Imperium.  I wonder how many Traveller ref\'s did the same thing?
  So, if you don\'t like something - change it.  Then post it here
so the rest of us can have an opportunity to benefit from your efforts. :)

Definitely.  I\'d assume that the Terrans had a few advantages over the
Vilani, in particular:
  o Mobility
    The Vilani were at TL-11 (max), and more generally at TL-10.  In other
    words the majority of their starships were J-1, with J-2 being reserved
    for the military.  Even if all of the Vilani warships were J-2 (and I
    doubt that they were), supplies would be restricted to J-1
    The Terrans are supposed to have clinched their victory over the
    Vilani when they hit TL-12; in addition to the psychological advantage
    of the meson gun, these new ships had superior strategic mobility, too.
  o Initiative
    The Vilani were not used to fighting against someone who could fight
    back effectively.  In the past, the Vilani contacted cultures and
    assimilated them on a timetable suitable to the Vilani.
    The Terrans, on the other hand, contacted the Vilani and initiated
    hostilities (sort of); the Vilani aparrently never gained the initiative
    (or if they did, didn\'t keep it for long).
  o Command Structure
    The Vilani traditionally organize themselves into committees, and most
    decisions are made collectively (rare Vilani "heros" are known for
    making decisions - that the group subesquently approves of - on the
    spot).  With no "hero" in the colonial administration, the time-lag
    required to achieve a consensus decision and communicate it back to the
    front robbed the Vilani of flexability and quick decision-making.
    Presumably the Terrans used a command structure similar to the present
    day military commands, which provides more speed and flexability.  In
    addition, the Terrans are, towards the end of the conflict at least,
    known for having a brilliant commander who was not adverse to making
    decisions rapidly and on his own.
  o Logistics
    The Vilani were fighting on the frontier of their empire.  Depending on
    how long the area had been colonized, and what the percieved military
    threats were, it\'s quite possible that there were no worlds in the
    combat zone with the proper combination of high-tech, industrial
    resources and population to support the large fleets needed to fight
    the Terrans.  The resulting long supply lines into the interior would
    cause an enormous delay in bringing up supplies (at J-1) and
    reinforcements (even at J-2); let alone the difficulties caused if the
    supplies had to come from a different bureau\'s area.
    The Terrans had a high-tech, high-population, industrial world that
    was rich in developed resouces; Terra was probably outproduced any world
    within 100 parsecs, and most of the early battles where probably fought
    much closer to Terra than to Vland.

This combination of factors probably made it possible for the Terrans to
achieve favorable odds when and where they needed them.

Okay, the Ine Givar  are  primarily  an  anti-Imperial  terrorist
movement active in the Spinward Marches  since  before  the  5FW.
Culling from various sources (including Survival Margin, the  5FW
boardgame, and the Traveller News Service) the following  aspects
can be discovered or inferred:

The Ine Givar recruit anywhere and this includes universities and
colleges where they sell themselves as a pro-democracy movement.

Their most famous act of  terrorism  _before_  the  5FW  was  the
sabotage of General Shipyard\'s Vehicle Assemble Building No 3  on
Pixie/Regina.  This facility housed the main assembly line in the
region for production of L-Hyd tanks.  Apart from this,  acts  of
terrorism had been limited to "scattered and ineffective  strikes
on Efate and Feri" and (possibly) Forboldn.

During the  5FW  they  are  attributed  with  "numerous  acts  of
destruction and sabotage" including...

- An  explosion  and  fire  in  the  scout  base  facilities   at
  Meleto/Mora.

- The release of a deadly viral toxin into the  water  supply  of
  the Imperial Navy installation at Bendor/Glisten.

Additionally, the Zhodani funnelled funds and other support  into
the Ine Givar in the lead up to the 5FW  swelling  the  Guerrilla
movement side of the organisation.  This was either direct or via
the Sword Worlds.  There were 10 notional guerrilla units at  the
start of the 5FW (minimum  3  on  Efate,  1  on  Ruie,  the  rest
anywhere).  Each unit has a strength  of  10%  of  local  defense
battalions at local TL.

At the start of 1107, Army Vice-Marshal Lord  Calavan  (commander
of the 43rd Army) formed the  3rd  (Provisional)  Frontier  Army.
Its mandate was to end insurgency action by the Ine Givar in  the
Vandere  district  of  Kormoran  (Efate\'s  northern   continent).
Staged  at  Down  Franklin  Starport  on  Efate   the   3rd   PFA
consolidated the 4 Imperial brigades already on planet (including
the Imperial Army\'s 1197th Separate Light Infantry  Brigade)  and
added another 12 (including the  317th  Air-Mechanised  Brigade).
This makes for 1000 battalions of local troops (TL13),  plus  160
battalions of Imperial Army troops (TL14?), plus  an  undisclosed
number of mercenary units ... say an effective strength  of  1500
battalions (double Imperial Army effective strength to reflect TL
advantage).  Ine Givar guerrillas  number  between  300  and  900
battalions (TL13) ... using the 3:1 \'rule\' I\'d guess  500  (or  5
notional units).  The Ine Givar tried  to  destroy  the  Imperial
force using a captured  Broadsword  class  Mercenary  Cruiser  on
collision course with Efate (and booby-trapped with a 5 megatonne
thermonuclear device).

One other thing:  "Ine Givar" does not appear  to  be  a  Zhodani
name.  I haven\'t found which language it is yet.



To summarise:

> 1. What is the modus operandi?  What are they trying to do?  What is
> their cause?

They used both acts  of  terrorism  (bombs,  contaminating  water
supplies,  etc),  and  insurgency  operations.   Their   rhetoric
relates to the overthrow of the nobility in favour of democracy.



> 2. What worlds are known to harbor Ine Givar cells?

Definitly Efate/Regina, Ruie/Regina, and Rhylanor/Rhylanor.

Probably Feri/Regina, Forboldn/Regina, and Regina/Regina.

Probable elsewhere throughout  the  sector  but  focused  on  the
coreward half and Regina subsector inparticular.



> 3. What are their numbers on these worlds?

Impossible to say, but at start of 5FW  some  500  battalions  of
guerrillas on Efate/Regina alone.  Perhaps the same number  again
of guerrillas  on  other  planets.  That\'s  an  equivalent  force
strength of 1000 battalions in total, and at 2000  personnel  per
battalion (including support personnel) it comes to 2 million!

The number required for terrorist  activities  is  negligable  by
comparison.  An \'active service unit\' of about 6 personnel  could
function away from any support for several months at a  time  and
still do a lot of damage.  I\'d guess not more that a dozen active
service units across the Spinward Marches at any one  time  (most
of their activity probably would only make local world news,  and
not TNS).

Supporters are harder  to  size.  Recruiters,  money  collectors,
rabble rousers, community leaders ... many would claim not to  be
actual members, yet would provide an essential political  support
base.  Based on troop size the political base needs to be in  the
100 million plus range ... though not all from the  same  planet.
(Efate has a total of 8000 million people at the time of the 5FW,
and of that only 50 million need support the Ine Givar - a little
over half a percent of the local population.)

So, a political nightmare: too few members and supporters for any
kind of political mandate to the  Imperial  government  (or  even
local governments), yet too many to just ignore.



> 4. How old is the group?  Have they been around for years in some
> form?

Guerrilla activities on Efate seem to have  started  around  1100
and rose  to  a  peek  in  1107.  Terrorist  activities  probably
started sometime before this but there is no  information.  After
the 5FW support from the Zhodani Consulate was cancelled and they
apparently dewindled into obscurity (making  a brief come back in
1124).



For more information check out  the  Traveller  New  Service  for
201-1105,  274-1105,  241-1105,  004-1106,  148-1106,   003-1107,
078-1107, and 243-1107.

Hope that helps.

Life in Australia must be rather sedate.  That\'s the statistic for _my_
generation in Canada; my students are looking at half a dozen career changes.
 Of course, if the private sector gets its way these will all be part-time
careers :-(

Personally, I\'m on my 2nd - 4th career.  I trained as an electrical engineer,
spent five years designing hardware, tech writing, and coding software,
lectured at a community college, retrained as a teacher, and now teach
computer science and administer a UNIX network for computer animators.  That
doesn\'t include some freelance programming, writing, and photography work.

(Parenthetically, my students are training for careers that didn\'t exist when
I was in university.)

Joe Walsh brought up something interesting in the last digest: what are
we going to do with the mailing list when "New Traveller" comes out?  I
would say that this depends on who is planning to buy/play the new
release.

If, like me, most of the xboaters plan to buy and convert to NT (barring
the possibility that it is a completely screwed up mess), then I would
suggest one amalgamated list for CT/MT/NT (NT is for "New Traveller", you
saw the acronym here first :-), and one for TNE.  My reasoning is that the
new release is essentially "what MT should have been", and thus belong on
the same list as MT.

If, on the other hand, most of CT/MT players _don\'t_ want to convert to
NT, then perhaps a third list would be in order.

There is another possibility of course.  And that is that _everyone_
including CT, MT and TNE afficionadoes converts to NT.  Then we could
have one big list.  ("You may say I\'m a dreamer...")

I guess we\'ll just have to wait and see what Harold\'s "Quick Poll" results
turn up.

Happy Easter, fast well, and all that good stuff,
Charles.

I agree with your assessment.  That\'s the trouble with house
rules: they tend to work well with the people playing at that "house,"
but perhaps not so well for the population at large.  That is to say, my
players never have gotten concentrated on character improvement to the
exclusion of other things, so that weakness of the rule never became a
problem for me.  I thought the caveat about exceptional usage would halt
some of that (if you have to put yourself and/or your party at great risk
in order to get a mere CHANCE at gaining a skill or skill level, how
often are you going to do it?  and, if you do, doesn\'t that improve the
excitement of the game anyway?), but perhaps not.
Of course, that was an additional reason for posting it.
Hopefully, other Referees out there will try it out in their games,
tinker with it, and post their modifications for the benefit of us all.
I hope you give us some feedback on how it goes in your game, and
what changes (if any) you make to it in order to accomodate the
predilictions of your own players.

> I for one would like to encourage the posting of some of your other

I\'ll do that.  Again, it\'s a large collection of house rules, so
there are quite a few rules in there that many will consider superfluous
in their own campaigns.  But, some might find them useful (I hope).

Thank you for the nice comments.

That\'s a good thought, and it\'s one I hadn\'t considered.  I was
thinking along the line of whether, when it comes out, NT turns out to be
as rules-compatible with CT as Ken Whitman of Imperial Games lead me to
believe.  If it\'s much like CT, with minor updates, then it would make
sense to put it in with CT and MT in xboat.  But if it is a different
system entirely, then put it in the Traveller mailing list with TNE.  I
like the idea of keeping the xboat mailing list purely for the classic
Traveller-type rules systems.
But your idea seems better reasoned, and since we will have the
handy reference of the survey to be completedy shortly, it sounds like it
will be easier to implement as well.

Thank you.  Happy Easter to you, as well.

                         Pirates of Space

     In Traveller, Pirates play a big part in everyday space life.
The Imperium and the other governments are always on the lookout
for this, the scourge of space.  The pirates are
outlaws who have taken to attacking and plundering honest ships,
most especially traders.  As trade is the lifeblood of all
governments throughout space, pirates tend to be the most hated of
all criminals.
     It is rare, however, that a pirate will attack government-
owned ships.  Nor will they routinely attack ships bearing the
insignia of one of the Mega Corporations.  Both of these
activities are much too risky for the average pirate.
     Pirates generally focus the thrust of their activities on
free traders and small merchant companies.  These ships yield the
best profit to risk ratio.
     This article deals with creating a character who is a member
of this "underground" organization.  It presents a step-by-step
process of fleshing out a complete Pirate character in the
tradition of Mercenary, High Guard and Scouts (qv).


                    Character Creation Process

     First, create the basic Traveller character by throwing 2D
for each of the six characteristics (Strength, Dexterity,
Endurance, Intelligence, Education and Social Standing), noting
the scores on a sheet of paper.
     The second step is to make the enlistment throw.  A throw of
7+ is required, with a +1 DM for a Social Standing score of 7- and
a +2 DM for Endurance 9+.
     Next, determine the type of organization the character is
joining.  Roll 2D6: two through five results in a Solitary Ship
Group, meaning that it is a relatively small organization, with
only one ship, probably hovering near one major world in a system;
six through nine results in the character being part of a small
group of ships, probably preying only on those who venture into
its\' two-or three-parsec territory; ten through twelve results in
being accepted into an Organized Crime ring, which may be as big
as a subsector, a sector, or even larger.  Whichever organization
is determined is used for the entire career.
     Fourth, determine where the character is stationed.  A roll
(1D) of one through five results in the character being on a ship
for the term.  A roll of six means the character has been caught,
and will spend the term in Prison, thereafter being mustered out
of the Pirates.  Stationing is only rolled at the beginning of
each term.
     During each year of the term, rolls will be made on the
appropriate assignment determination table.  Once the assignment
has been determined, make the appropriate rolls on the
corresponding assignment resolution table.  Note the results, such
as skills (which should be rolled immediately) and promotions on a
sheet of paper.  Once all four years have been completed in this
manner, go back through the steps, starting with re-enlistment,
and complete as many terms as wanted (or until the character is
put in prison).


                    Definition of Assignments

Crew:  The character is a member of the normal crew, and performs
tasks necessary on any starship, such as navigation, piloting and
acting as medic.

Boarding:  The charcter is a member of a boarding party, and will
see mostly combat action.  The charcter will have several
opportunities for physical self-improvement.

Slaving:  The character is on the slave training, disciplining and
trading end of pirate life.

Guarding:  The character acts as security guard on board ship, and
may even be a personal guard to an officer.

Mines:  The character works in the dangerous mines on planets with
horrible climates.

Factory:  The character pays for his offenses by producing useful
items for the public he has wronged.

Detention Camps:  The character is held in a prison-like detention
camp, in which he may gain useful every-day skills.

Cells:  Solitary confinement.  The character sees no one and does
nothing.  Essentially, it is a year of the character\'s life that
is wasted.


                            New Skill

Concealment:  The ability to hide objects on or about one\'s person
during a search.  At the highest level, objects may be concealed
from even the most thorough searches.


                           Pirate Ranks

E1   2nd Henchman (TR-1)      O1   Second Assistant Leader (TR-4)
E2   1st Henchman (TR-1)      O2   First Assistant Leader (TR-4)
E3   2nd Corporal (TR-1)      O3   Third Leader (TR-5)
E4   1st Corporal (TR-2)      O4   Second Leader (TR-5)
E5   3rd Sergeant (TR-2)      O5   Leader (TR-6)
E6   2nd Sergeant (TR-2)
E7   1st Sergeant (TR-3)
E8   3rd Lieutenant (TR-3)
E9   2nd Lieutenant (TR-3)
E10  1st Lieutenant (TR-4)

Benefit Rolls follow the basic Traveller rule of one per term plus
one per promotion.  However, the promotions are counted only in
Traveller Ranks (TR), not Pirate Ranks.

I beg to differ.

In a table listing 42 battles, from 1805 to 1967, Numbers Predicitons & War
figure 1-7 shows that:
        28 attackers succeeded, 14 defenders succeeded
        24 victors were numerically inferior

I do some programming (Visual Basic and learning C) and would like to get
something going WITH some people.  Who knows?  We just might get MM\'s
attention and produce something of enough merit to be included in the

I don\'t know how others feel, but Traveller has enriched enough of my life

Traveller is about playing an RPG that\'s part published _guidelines_, and part
your own imagination. No-one ever agrees with all pulished materials and rules,
and the great thing about Traveller is the freedom we have to change it to suit
ourselves.

I hope that Merc and Imperium Games continue to release new ideas for Traveller,
and I hope that others like me will pick up the best of those ideas for our
campaigns, and leave those that don\'t fit our particular needs. Vive La
Difference ! Personally, I think that Travellers\' future lies in the direction
of  more choices (like Products/ timelines/ sectors/ adventures/ characters/
books/ etc) and less hard "canon" ( compared to something like AD&D for example
).

Yes, all too true. However, what I was pointing out was that the likelihood was
that the Vilani had such a disproportionate force on their side (1500:1 at the
start, still 15:1 by the start of the final stages of the Nth Interstellar war)
that they could simply have 5 times terran forces along the front,
continuously, another 5 times in depth behind, and striking forces of another
five times worth spread out. There is no way that the Terrans could have even
defended against such overwhelming odds, let alone attacked. Of course, you may
well dispute the figures on which Vilani strength is based (and let\'s not get
into *that* one, again ;-} ), but *if* they are correct, then the 3:1 rule is
massively in their favour, at least at the end when the Empire put all of its
resources against them (or all those that were available).

Other than that, you are quite correct.

    'body' => 'Since people are posting their "house" rules, here\'s one of mine:

I use the MT rules and have noticed a problem with the Combat section.
Here\'s an example to illustrate the situation.

Joe BadGuy is 10 meters away from Sheila GoodGuy.  The two are engaged
in direct fire combat and both are under cover.  They just can\'t seem
to hit each other.  When it\'s Joe\'s turn in the combat round, he can
get up, run right up to Sheila, stick his gun in her nose and fire.

She can\'t interrupt because you can\'t interrupt your own attacker.  She
can\'t move because it\'s not her turn.

A similar situation actually happened during a session and spawned a
debate, lasting one and a half hours, over the rules.  Everyone, including
myself, was new to the MT combat rules but we couldn\'t find a way out
of this situation.

What we came up with was a new rule:  if you\'re moving and firing in the same
turn, you can\'t fire if you\'ve changed range bands to the target.  In the
example above, Joe BadGuy is moving from medium to close and therefore
must wait until next turn to fire.  Sheila GoodGuy will, of course, fire
first at her next turn.

Her response is then exactly like what she would do if this were real life;
she sees her opponent running up to her and fires at that opponent as soon
as she can see the whites of his eyes (close range).

What do you think of this rule?  Can you suggest a better solution or point
out something we missed in the original rules?

Feedback appreciated!

Thanks for taking the time to post those rules!  I\'m always on the lookout for
new character generation rules.  I\'ll incorporate those into mine, if that\'s
okay.

You\'ve fallen into the trap of thinking that a job is defined by the
*title*, rather than by the *skill set* required to carry it out.

Also, most of the jobs you list above amount to a *minority* of the
jobs in existence. You lump all "white collar" workers into "office
workers", and the only "blue collar" jobs you mention are plumbers and
carpenters, both of which are rather special cases.

Consider a "factory worker". That\'s what I was for 10 years. But no
factory worker when I was in school (even high school) could have done
my job any better than someone fresh out of school. And if I went back
now, my previous experience would be next to useless. *None* of the
equipment I used is still there, and the newer stuff operates a lot
differently.

An office worker from even the late 70s would have a lot of trouble
dealing with a current office. For the same reasons, though not quite
as extreme. The basic equipment has changed.

Getting back to factory work, the *product* (not the specific item, but
the *class* of item) didn\'t exist until I was in my teens.

Pick something like "auto worker". Then consider how many of them are
out of work or had to change jobs because of changes in the
manufacturing process. Consider the fact that "technological
unemployment" is *not* just a catch phrase for newscasters. It actually
happens.

It used to be that you *could* spend twenty to thirty years doing the
same job, with only relative minor changes in the equipment. These
days, it is *expected* that all the equipment will have to be replaced
in less than 10 years. And depending on how automated it is *and* on
what new skills may be needed to operate it, you may not be needed (or
*able*) to operate it.

I was at that company for almost 14 years. Almost no one had the same
job for more than a few years. But the company (unlike many) encouraged
people to learn other jobs *in* the company. And it tried hard to
recruit from inside. At other companies, you\'re as apt to get laid of
when they replace your job as not.

This *will* get worse until we hit a "balance" between the rate at
which we can re-tool, and the rate at which we can train people.

I\'d expect that in the high tech societies in Traveller, things have
slowed *way* down. Mostly from the need to maintain equipment
compatability across large numbers of worlds. After all, while it may
be *possible* for someone to come up with a new way to produce the
widgets used in the XYZ assembly on a jump drive, and to re-tool to
make them that way in a matter of *days* (we can see this point coming
*now*), it won\'t be done unless the new widgets are interchangeable
with the old ones.

Consider the situation if they aren\'t. You have to plan on getting the
new parts out to *all* the parts depots, and then notifying all the
folks with that model drive of when the switchover date is. This is
both so that you don\'t get stuck with lots of old parts on hand, and so
that the users don\'t get stuck *needing* the old part after they are
gone.

Y\'know, this alone could explain the slow rate of technical advancement
*and* why it tends to go in "jumps". By the time you\'ve determined a
distribution plan for a "minor" advance, somebody in R&D has come up
with an advance on the advance. So you just sort of save them up until
they amount to enough of a major improvement to be worth going to the
trouble of co-ordinating a change.

I do agree that most stuff handled by "people" is likely to be "custom"
work. For one thing, we aren\'t all that far from the ability to
reproduce any reasonable object at will. Not necessarily by Star Trek
type replicators, or nano-tech, but just by having what amounts to a
"universal" machine tool controlled by computer. Feed in the CAD/CAM
drawings and specs and out comes the part. And there\'ll proably be
equipment that can produce at least a "first cut" set of specs by
"scanning" an original. The limits would be in how finely you can
control the composition and structure at the molecular and later
*atomic* levels.

So "machinery" and other "gross" materials will be easy. Stuff like
ICs, advanced composites, etc will be harder. And biological level
complexity (and beyond) will only be doable this way at the highest
tech levels.

So I guess we get a lot of automated gear, a lot of folks with the
right skills/temperment producing either specs, or handmade "models",
as well as some one of a kind custom items. And we will *always* have
the "salesman" type <sigh>. Some "service" type jobs may get automated.
After all, consider that it really wouldn\'t be all *that* hard to build
something that would replace all the cooks and most of the staff at a
MacDonalds. Right now it isn\'t cost effective. But I rather suspect
that a Macdonald\'s with just a couple of people to clean the tables and
replace modules in the "kitchen" if something broke down isn\'t all that
far off.

Other types of "service" will still exist. But there will *have* to be
a change in cultural attitude about the jobs or people won\'t do them.
It\'s quite possible to be a servant and take pride in the job. But only
if the culture is willing to acknowledge that doing such a job well
*is* respectable.

Consider the stereotypical English butler. That is the sort of model
that service jobs are likely to follow. They will require skills, both
people skills, and "technical" skills. And they will be valued by the
people they serve. There are a *lot* of tasks involved in running a
large household, and doing them well isn\'t easy. If your staff quits,
you are in *trouble*.

There are likely to be other service jobs where the service is still
"personal" but to a more general client base. "Hairdresser", "tailor",
"courtesan". And there *will* be restaurants with human staffs. But
you\'ll be paying for service, atmosphere and that "flair" with the food
that autochefs just can\'t manage.

There will also be "office" jobs, though I suspect that we can scarcely
imagine what would be involved. I rather suspect that the only non
"management" positions will be along the line of current "executive
secretaries" (which is a job that *really* calls for JOAT skills!).

And there will be "professionals", though most of the "serrvice" jobs
above are effectively on a par with what we consider "professions" now.

The one thing there *won\'t* be are jobs that require little
intelligence, skill, or training. Any job like that can be done better
by a robot.

IF one counts simply numbers without modification for anything the
3:1 rule is obviously wrong.

IF one modifies the numbers suitably considering training, logistics,
experience, morale, quantity of vodka, quality of desserts etc etc the 3:1
can BE MADE accurate.

It seems to me that all force multiplies are very important but
are converted into numbers in rather arbitrary ways. If I trained for
2 years and you trained for 2 weeks, am I 50 times better than you are?
5 times? 2 times? 1.1 times? adjusting these weights is not easy and
there is no simple criterion to do it except that of reproducing the
desired result.

Thus I would conclude that the 3:1 rules is a very rough criterion which
works when the opponents are comparable in terms of force multipliers
available to them. When this equality is not present one can factor
in other terms to make it work and, surprise surprise, it can work.

Hmmm...it\'s been a couple of years since I owned the MT rules, and at
least five since I used them, so I can\'t really comment on the official
MT rules.  However, in my own CT campaigns, I always followed the rule
that all combat actions take place simultaneously in the game, whereas
in real life the players take turns saying what they do, rolling dice, etc.

If Joe BadGuy did that move and shoot combination, Sheila GoodGuy would
be able to do just what you have said.  Like you pointed out, in real
life combatants don\'t patiently wait for the opponent to take his turn. :)

In my game, the session would probably run like this:

Joe Badguy:  "To heck with this.  I\'m going to rush her, gun at the
ready.  I\'ll fire as soon as it looks like I have a good chance of
hitting her (if she pops up to take a shot, if she rushes me, if I get
around her cover before she sees me, etc.)."

Sheila GoodGuy: "I carefully peek from behind cover in preparation for
taking another shot just as I have been doing, and see him running at
me.  I immediately fire a shot."

Referee:  "Okay, so both of you roll, since Shiela is now only under
partial cover and Joe figures he can get a decent shot in."

Both characters could be hit, both could suffer any level of wounds.
Shiela is in the better position because she is still behind cover, however.

A poor role-player doing the character of Sheila might say, "OK,
so I hide behind this crate, waiting for him to peek around.  I have my
gun ready and will hit him at point blank range when he does."  This
role-player would be using knowledge her character would not have - that
Joe is running toward her - unless the character exposed herself to
fire.  My players have learned not to do such things, so this wouldn\'t be
an issue.  It might not work well in other people\'s games, though.

Sure, that\'s fine with me.  Just please let me know of any
problems you find with the system, and especially and solutions to those
problems you find.

This would also explain why the Tech Level chart for CT has
relatively fewer advancements listed toward the bottom of the chart.  As
the Imperium expands, not only is it more difficult to successfully
introduce new technology, it also becomes much more appealing (to
comanies) to sell old technologies to worlds on which it would be
considered "new" technology.
The incentive for producing new technological advances will
decrease as the market for such devices decreases in relation to the
market for old tech.

Perhaps the non-specialist will be valued.  In our society, the
Jack-of-all-Trades isn\'t much valued.  The person at the office who does
minor repairs on office equipment, negotiates contracts with suppliers,
moves boxes, maintains the central files, and does a million other tasks
that the "professionals" wouldn\'t dirty their hands with is paid the same
as the receptionist.  Perhaps, in the future, such a multi-talented
individual will command a higher salary and more respect.
It reminds me of Robert Heinlein\'s "General Services" company
from his short story, "We Also Walk Dogs."  The company would walk your
dog, change the baby, do your shopping, or anything else you would need
to be done but which you do not have time to do.  In the story, they made
tons of money doing just that (and other, less-common tasks).

Where does it say that you can\'t interrupt your own attacker?  I\'ve checked
my Player\'s Manual and the errata and it doesn\'t say anything like that.
Even without that, though, it does seem logical enough that Sheila should be
able to pick Joe off in the middle of his move no matter what.  I can\'t
think of a good rules solution, though.

In the last few Xboat and TML Digests there have been some messages
about what we should do with the mailing lists when the new traveller
comes out.  I think we should keep it the same, and let
people discuss Travler 4, on both lists.  Alot of the discussion on
both lists is not about rules, but about the Traveller universe, as all
of the rule sets use the same universe, albeit at different times, this
sort of discussion is useful to everbody. I started playing Traveller
with the Traveller Book back in 1981, but now I use the TNE rules, and
the RC setting, I like it, and I think it works well with my current
group of players. I still find X-boat to be interesting and useful.
Now with Traveller 4 trying to cover a variety of time periods starting
Miliue 0, and eventually getting to Miliue 1200 and beyond, it
would be a shame to further divide up Traveller fans.  After all
which ever rule set you use, its still Traveller.
Well enough rambling.

Well, I have, actually ... through ex-students I keep in contact with and with
the younger members (90%) of the games club I am president of. And they have no
belief in the above statement, either. But, more on this below.

Yes, I may well be falling into that trap. But I probably didn\'t express the
"theory" in question very well, either ... the idea is that the kids I teach
now will be *forced* to change their jobs several times because the jobs that
they have will be rendered obsolete. This is, to me, dubious.

Let me give several examples -

1) When I started teaching 20 years ago, we were still using Gestetner (Roneo to
you NorAm types?) ink duplicators and Fordigraph spirit stencil duplicators, no
computers at all, videos (if available) on 1/2" reel-to-reel tapes, and the
like. Now? Well, computers are more common, videos are VHS types, and
Photocopiers have *completely* replaced all the previous duplicators. But, as
for the actual *job*, apart from the usual fad changes in regulatory
requirements (which, take it from me, are mostly given lip service while we get
on with what actually *works*) and administrivia, it\'s virtually identical (no,
I\'ll go further, it\'s *completely* identical). I see no developments that are
in line now or in the near future that will change the core job that I do.

And I\'d go as far as to say (as I did recently) that teaching will be pretty
much the same in the world of the Imperium, too. Lots of extra you-beaut *aids*
to make you more effective, but the core job will probably be the same.

2) One of my ex-students went into Nursing and she\'s doing quite well - and
intends to be a Nurse for the rest of her working life. Her mother\'s a nurse as
well and, though she made the point that she\'s had to adapt to many changes in
the thirty years she\'s been doing the job, she\'s still doing the same basic job
she did 30 years ago. Sure, the tech has changed, and made the job easier, but
the basic job is the same ... and she developed the skills to use all that new
tech *gradually* as it was introduced. Her daughter expects the same sort of
changes to occur in her working career.

3) Another of my ex-students has been working in the retail trade as a shop
assistant (now assistant manager) for, what, something like ten years, and he
has seen considerable changes in that time, as well. Computerised inventory
control, computerised book searches (he works in a Bookstore) and the like -
but the books don\'t get onto the shelves themselves and the largest part of the
job is *still* having knowledge of the product that he can impart to customers
when they have inquiries.

4) Another friend has worked in the Printing trades for something like twenty
years also, starting with hot metal and now working with computerised
typestting gear ... his skills have changed, but the job is the same.

So, what I\'m getting at is, how do you define a job? By the skills needed to
do it or the end product? I see your point and it\'s quite true - but some jobs
*are* going to be made obsolete ... like, say, Scribes were by the introduction
of the Printing Press (no crossover) or draymen by the introduction of the
motor vehicle.

True, but what I\'m trying to get at is - what *other* jobs may be special
cases? I don\'t pretend to think I know all the answers ... and the examples
that I gave were meant purely for the purposes of discussion.

Fair enough. However, if you *had* stayed there, you\'d *still* be a "factory
worker" (or whatever the job title was) and you *would* have the skills, you\'d
have picked them up along the way. This is where we get into a fundamental
difference between the US (and Canadian?) experience and that of Oz ... I
understand that a vast number of US citizens change address each year - in the
sense (so the stats i saw claimed) that they change cities and states; this is
unusual in Oz, and not at all expected in most occupations. The thing is, do
these workers changing their career do it simply because they *want* to change
it (which may, so it seems to me, be the case in the US?) or do they do it
because they *have* to? It would seem to me that the latter case is the only
true support of the statement.

So look at it this way, with automation of the sort (I ... even if no-one else
can) extrapolate from Traveller Tech, factories of TL/15 will have no personnel
except for a handful of maintenance workers for those jobs the maintenance
robots can\'t handle for some reason and a handful of programmers to keep an eye
on the automated manufacturing process. No Fitters & Turners, no Lathe
Operators, no Drill-Press operators or whatever ... a whole class of "job"
(whatever that means) *gone*. But are the Maintenance workers and Programmers
a special "new" class of job or simply an ongoing development of ones that
already exist. Perhaps I\'m expressing myself badly here?

No, I\'m not disputing it at all. I\'m simply wary about accepting it as glibly
as the local pollies and "consultants" seem to ... without thinking about what
it really *means*. That\'s what I\'m talking about ... what *does* it mean in
Traveller terms? What jobs *will* be around at TL/15? Will they simply be old
jobs done with new tech or will they be jobs that we cannot even concieve of
the need for now? And how many of the currently available jobs we accept as
necessary will become obsolete *completely* in the intervening years?

For example, one thing that is sure to raise hackles. Will Starships still need
human Astrogators with sufficiently advanced computers. Now, bear with me a
moment ... when I did my last two years of High School, we were *still* using
*slide rules* and books of *mathematical tables* (you know, Logs, Geometric
functions like Sine, Cosine etc.) to work things out by hand on paper.
Calculators *just* came in and were *banned* from all exams (and these didn\'t
even have memories, let alone being programmable!). We had to learn how to work
out all these things *with pencil and paper* even though we always had the
tables handy. Today, except at the absolute top levels, no-one learns any of
this, it\'s all done on your handy calculator ... and exams are based on the
*assumption* that a calculator will be used!

So, with sufficiently advanced, multiply backed up, computers ... and the TL/15
(or whatever) equivalent of an emergency "hand-held calculator" special purpose
dedicated astrogation "calculator" ... would Astrogators be needed? Surely a
tech to make sure the computers don\'t go down and a programmer to keep their
programming bug free would be all that would be needed? (and, *NO* I\'m *NOT*
seriously suggesting that Astrogators would be removable ... just offering it
as a possible example!).

Fair enough, I see your point.

Why? Wouldn\'t it be a great business advantage to have the absolute latest tech
on sale when the others don\'t ... a great marketing advantage that would enable
you to steal their markets?

But with automated factories, producing an obsolete part from plans in computer
storage would be child\'s play ... expensive, of course, as it\'s a special order
item. Perhaps that\'s why everything in Traveller is so ridiculously expensive.
Actually, I did an article for a local fanzine entitled "Pardon me, but this
plug won\'t go into that socket" which made the assumption that all the tech
available in Traveller is so expensive because of the reasons you suggest -
there are definite imperial standards, and to get the special "Imperial
Standard of Approval" Seal you need to meet them. Of course, that doesn\'t mean
that everyone does ... but that\'s a cause for the sort of problem that I
suggested in the article\'s title. Say you have an absolute cutting edge TL/12
computer ... it\'s not compatible with the "Approved" model because the latter
is *not* cutting edge, but it\'s bog standard. Because people on planets capable
of producing TL/12 stuff want the absolute best, they buy local models - but
"Travellers" need to have something that can be repaired anywhere. Ergo, some
TL/12 "imperial approved" units are made, but are generally short run items and
cost more as a result. (Well, its *an* explanation ... I make no pretence that
its the *only* one).

Yes, yes, yes!!!

Some very interesting and thought provoking ideas.

In MT, the combat turns are definitely not simultaneous, which is both
more realistic and causes the problem I mentioned.  That\'s one of the
reasons Tactics skill is more important that it was in CT:  the side with
the highest Tactics skill level (the tactical point pool) decides who goes
first.

They stated (page 1) that given that a single unit of linked control panel
takes up 10-30 liters (depending on type) the circuitry in the panel is
enough to control simple vehicles (ie if the vehicle only needs 3 CP just
install 2 holo-dynamic panels.  In 1010 vehicles it was suggested that
one person could manage up to 12 units of panels, I\'d put that at more like
4 or 6 units, but opinions differ.

This brings me to a related point, there are serious problems with the
computer vs robot brain rules.  In the adventure Knightfall it is stated
that he ships computer volunteers sensory info (verbally) at one point
(page 20).  I\'ve found references to this a few other places too.  If a
starship computer can speak, how is it different form a robot brain?

Proposal:  Book 8: Robots implies that the big problem with robot brains is
the reliability of synaptic processors.  it seems that occasionally
synaptic robot brains act "irrationally".  Fine, that\'s the last thing
you want running your starship.  My guess is installing such a thing on a
ship would likely invalidate every warranty and insurance contract in the
Imperium.

However, there are also non-synaptic robot brains.  Low data robot brains
are no more than ordinary computers a few tech levels from now.  High
data robot brains are the same thing, only they use lots of parallel
processing.  Neither of these alternatives sounds any more unreliable
than any other computer.  A High data robot brain with basic Command
installed could speak up and inform the crew of a problem, just like in
the adventure Knightfall.  Why not just replace vehicle computers with
robot brains?  They are much smaller (which makes since, the MT vehicle
computers are ridiculously huge) but High data robot brains are still
rather expensive.

    'body' => 'In the case shown last Journal, Shiela could have interrupted, as well as
should have, assuming that she had not acted during the turn yet.

I do make one clarification to the MT interrupt rules: The interrupted
unit/character/animal gets to complete its turn after its interrupter has
finished; while this is implied (and listed in one of the MTJ\'s) it is not
explicit. The task as printed in all of my copies of MT PH is WRONG. It
reads:

        To interrupt another unit\'s turn
        Roputine, Movement Speed (Safe)
        Referee: If this task is successful, it becomes the interrupting
unit\'s turn. The interruppted unit\'s turn is considered spent for the
combat round. A Failed attempt does not count as a spent turn.

It is clarified to be that the interrupted unit is committed to the action
declared, and if it survives, it will take that action after the
iterruptor\'s turn, and in any case cannot interrupt anyone else this combat
round, but after the interrupt is over, and the first unit gets back its
turn.

In the case of multiple actions, I allow one interrupt per action
announced. the interrupt is attempted (and resolved) BEFORE the announced
action is resolved. Example:

Joe Badguy, Vs Shiela Goodguy and Fred Hero. All in partial hard cover, as
before.

1) Fred Gets init. Declares he\'s gonna shoot joe.
2) Joe successfully interrupts fred, and announces moving out of cover
towards Shiela, and then shooting her.  shiela attempts and fails to
interrupt before Joe\'s movement, fred can\'t because he\'s been interrupted.
3) Joe moves, and then prceeds to the shooting at shiela, shiela attempts
and succceeds at interrupt, so after he moved, but before he can shoot...
4) Shiela shoots joe, who cannot interrupt, as he\'s been interrupted (Fred
is similarly restricted) then ducks for cover.
5) Joe is non-functional now, so when it revertts to him, he is "Bleeding
and unconscious", and his turn ends.
6) Fred finally gets to shoot joe.
7) Joe is pieces-parts.

This is the basis (and strength) of MT combat interrupts. diagrammed out

 Joe, this seems pretty usable and well-thought out, at least at
 first glance.  You\'ve omitted something, though:

 Skill degradation.  Unless a person is one of those rare
 individuals with a near-eiditic memory, skills that aren\'t used
 will degrade.

 I\'d consider something like this (off the top of my head; probably
 needs tweaking):

 [NOTE: I\'m assuming the existence of a task system not dissimilar
 to the MT task system - translate as needed]

 If a skill isn\'t used at all within 180 game days, the character
 has effectively lost one level of that skill (never dropping below
 0).  However, if the skill is used as you describe above for an
 adventure upgrade within a year (of the beginning of the 180-day
 period), the "increase" back to the "original" skill level is done
 with an "easy" roll, _plus_ the increase _above_ the original
 skill level can be taken, but at one difficulty level higher than
 normal.  If the skill isn\'t used at all within a year, it is
 "permanently" lost, and can only be increased back to "normal"
 using your procedure unmodified.

 The 180-day period can be halted by including use of the skill in
 a "workout" or "maintenance" routine that is engaged in not less
 than once per 30-day period.  If it is not "exercised" at that
 level, but it _is_ exercised, extend the degradation period
 proportionally.

 Use of the skill in "adventure" mode (fully active, non-workout)
 is equivalent to 2 workout usages if done in controlled, optimum
 conditions (e.g., a shooting competition), 3 usages if in
 non-hostile "field" conditions (e.g., hunting small, non-predator
 game), and 4 workouts if done in hostile field conditions (i.e.,
 hunting large predators, or in combat).

 [Note:  Although my examples above are for a firearms skill, there
 is no reason that conceptually similar situations cannot be
 developed for any skill.]

 Known drawbacks:

        Bookkeeping is required, preferably by the referee,
        concealed from the players.

        Additional complexity does not increase playability (i.e.,
        some trade of playability for realism).

 I consider these minor, but your mileage may vary.

thoughts (worth what you paid for them):

1) I would like to see the _current_ lists change as follows:
   * \'xboat\': same as current \'xboat\'
   * \'tne\': same as current \'traveller\'
   * \'traveller\': combined list -- one copy of messages sent to \'xboat\' and
      \'tne\' get sent to people subscribed to the \'traveller\' list

This would greatly benefit the large number of people who subscribe to both
lists.  People who want to subscibe to both rather than the \'traveller\' list
(because, for example, they filter their \'xboat\' and \'tne\' mail into separate
mailboxes) would still have that option.

Adding a new list would obviously greatly complicate this structure.

2) Regarding a list for the next version of Traveller, I suspect that the
volume of traffic will be great enough as we get closer to release that such a
list may be warranted.  On the other hand, it is still only April, so maybe
that decision is best put off for at least another month.

3) I vote for \'T4\' as the official abbreviation for the next version of
Traveller. \'NT\' sounds too much like Microsoft, and \'New Traveller\' and \'The
New Era\' may be confusing to the incredibl;y huge horde of new Travller
afficionados T4 will create.  <grin>

No.  Well, possibly if the product required no support and was disposable,
but not if it requires support or repairs.  Look at the problems
manufacturers have introducing new lines of cars - sales are slow until there
are enough mechanics that people believe that they can get their car repaired
wherever they go.  Or look at computers and computer software.

Arranging for a product to be available, _plus_ the required infrastructure,
is what takes time.

I used to work in the telecom business.  We would, if possible, release one
patch tape to fix many bugs, rather than many that each fixed only one bug.
Similarly, we couldn\'t use the latest technology for many things, because the
entire system had to remain compatible.

Now, we did do a lot of technological upgrading, but there were a lot of
inefficiencies because every upgrade still had to work with the older
technology.  (This is one reason I design most of my equipment as a sequence
of versions, with gradually increasing tech level.  I find teh inefficiencies
more realistic.  But I\'ll admit it\'s more work.)

You may be right Americans *choosing* to change their careers, Phil. I for
one have had three different but related jobs in the past 3 years. I managed
one of the campus computer labs, and picked up enough experience there to
apply for a job as a technician at an Apple Dealer in town. After a few
months working in service I moved into sales. Now I write web pages and
handle customer support for our company. On top of all that, my degree is in
theatre - deep in my heart I really want to be a waiter :)

Now, I more-or-less chose each of those jobs, generally moving on to
something more interesting (and better-paying!) than what I was doing. My
mom, on the other hand, has had a "career" in higher education, but the
duties she\'s performed have varied considerably. She\'s taught English to
foreign students and GIs, edited Navy training manuals and programs, and now
is an administrator of a "teaching resource center", in charge of keeping
track of technology and getting teachers to apply it in their curricula.
Now, to me that\'s what is meant by the statement you refer to, and my
experience (though more by choice) and hers are changes in career. We\'ve
both stayed in the same field (me computers, her higher education) but our
jobs have had significant enough differences that the statement, for me,
holds true. Whether choice or coercion is involved makes little difference
to me; from what I\'ve seen, both of us were "forced" by a desire to earn
(more) money.

Additionally, for me part of the appeal of change is to do something new and
different. I for one can\'t imagine happily working in a carrer for 20-40
years. I\'d stagnate. To me such would be nigh unto a death sentence. The
only career I can imagine staying in is one where something new must be
built from the ground up repeatedly - film and theatre production for
example. Until then, working with computers seems to be a reliable source of
income.

No, actually.  42 battles is a tiny sampling of the possible choices of
material from 1805-1967.
Also, you chart seems to only talk about numbers, which does not include
technologic modifiers.

Now, had you said ALL battles from 1805-1967, then I would have been more
interested.

I would, however, like to play miniatures with you and watch you test your
beliefs.  :-)

Jeff Zeitlin.  Please let me know what you think of them.


                Dynamic Characters for Traveller

     The basic Traveller system provides very limited rules by
which characters may change over time.  Book 2 outlines some
rules for character improvement, but it requires eight years of
a character\'s life in order to permanently gain one skill level.
That may be a realistic system, but it is not one which increases
enjoyment of the game.
     The following is an additional system by which a character\'s
skill set may evolve during the course of his adventures.  It
has been found to increase the excitement in adventures by
encouraging daring and risky acts on the part of player
characters.  This system provides rules for gaining, improving, and
degrading skills..  It is meant as an addition to the Book 2 rules,
not as a replacement.


Gaining New Skills

     In order to gain a new skill, a character must successfully
resolve a situation that would require that skill during the
course of an adventure.  If this occurs, at the end of the
adventure the referee should allow the player to roll 11+ for a
skill gain, with a positive DM of 1/2 the value of a related skill
(round fractions down).  When more than one skill is related to
the skill to be gained, only the one at the highest level is
used.
     In the case of weapons skill, a successful roll will yield a
skill of 1.  In all other instances, a skill level of 0 will be
received.  In either case, subsequent skill increases can be
attained using the rules outlined below, or through the course of
study given in Book 2.
     It is suggested that Jack-of-all-Trades skill not be used as
a "related" skill, as the knowledge granted by J-o-T is not great
enough to aid in the gaining of a new skill.
     Example:  Jyond, an ex-marine who has no survival skill, has
just completed an adventure wherein he had to live off of the land
while stranded on an uncivilized world for an extended period.
While his skill of Hunting-3 helped to some degree by giving him
meat, he also had to find sources of water and edible vegetation.
Through good judgment and some luck, Jyond survived this
ordeal.
     After the adventure is over and Jyond has been rescued, the
referee allows Jyond\'s player to roll 11+ with a DM of +1 for his
Hunting skill (3/2 = 1.5, rounded down to 1).  The player rolls 4
and 6, plus the DM of 1, yielding 11.  Jyond now has Survival-0.


Improving Current Skills

     In order to increase the level of skill a character has, the
skill must be successfully used during the adventure in such a way
that it would cause the skill to be increased.  High-risk uses of
the skill as well as using it in original ways are both examples
of this.  For instance, repairing an ATV while under fire as the
enemy advances steadily closer (Mechanical skill); piloting an
air/raft through twisting ravines to avoid radar detection
(Air/Raft skill); using a revolver to fire at a cable, severing it
and dropping 10 tons of cargo on the enemy group are all valid
specific instances wherein skill may be increased.
     Typically, two conditions must be met: first, the task must
be relatively difficult; second, success must have a great impact
on the adventure.  In the example above, the referee might have
imposed a DM of -4 to the roll for hitting the cable by firing the
revolver.  Assuming the character has a skill of Revolver-2, this
would require a roll of 10 or more on two dice for success.  This
is hardly a roll on which to pin the hopes of a band of
adventurers!  But, if all goes well, the adventurers will have
gained a significant advantage.
     The roll for increasing a skill is 7+, with a negative DM of
the current skill level.  In our example above, the player would
have to roll 9 or more on two dice to increase his Revolver skill
level to 3.  As you can see, this system does not allow for skill
increases beyond level 6.  If a character wishes to gain higher
skill levels, he or she must follow the rules outlined in Book 2.


Skill Degradation

     Unless a person is one of those rare individuals with a
near-eiditic memory, skills which are not used will degrade.
If a skill is not used at all within 180 game days, the character
will lose one level of that skill (although the skill level will
never fall below 0).
     A single routine use of the skill during an adventure
each 180 game days will keep the character from losing any skill
levels.  If such usage is impossible for the character, then skill
degradation may still be avoided by engaging in one hour of non-
adventure use of the skill per skill level.  For example, a character
with Electronics-3 must engage in three hours of non-adventure
skill  use each 180-day period or lose one skill level.   If the
character has the time and materials necessary for excersize
of the skill, then the player has only to inform the referee that
his character will, from time to time, be undertaking skill
maintenance activities.  But if, for whatever reason, the character
is unable to complete the requisite number of hours of skill
maintenance activities for a given 180-day period, then the
skill level will be lost.
     If the process for a skill increase (as outlined in the
previous section) is completed within a year of the date on
which the skill level was lost, the result will be that the skill
level will return to its earlier, pre-degrade level.  In addition,
the player may roll an unmodified 7+ in order to gain an
additional level.
     If such exceptional skill usage is not made within a
year (including a successful die roll as outlined in the previous
section), the skill level is permanently lost, and can only be
increased using the procedure outlined in the "Improving
Current Skills" section, above.


Using the Dynamic Character System

     Referees and players should keep in mind that a character may
never have more skill levels than the sum of his intelligence and
education characteristics.  This puts a restraint on which skills
players attempt to improve or add.  Because of this, players
may of course choose not to attempt skill improvement or gain in
some instances.  The referee will determine whether the character
may gain a skill as a result of his actions, but the player
decides whether to use that opportunity.  Additionally, a player may
decide to let one or more of his character\'s skills degrade, which will
also Amake room for more skills or skill levels.
       Use of the above system, in conjunction with the system given
in Book 2 of the Traveller rules, will create a more dynamic and
exciting universe for the players and the referee.

Sure. The reason is that the *product* is still the same. The same goes
for the Nurse example, the plumber and the carpenter. As well as
doctors and lawyers. The "product" isn\'t going to change substantail,
nor are the "raw materials. The tools are improving. So are the
techniques (though *very* slowly in some fields).

Actually, scribes still exist. They just do *custom* work now. An
interesting example is a monastery in New Mexico of an order that was
long reknowned for the talents of its scribes. They now have people
designing web pages, and doing hand illuminated art to be scanned in as
part of them!

So I guess it is both the skills *and* the product.

Not necessarily. There\'s a difference between learning to use a new
tool for the old job (xerox replacing spirit duplicators), or learning
to produce a new item on the same old tool (running a milling machine
and they want you to produce a different part) and having to produce
something different with different tools.

The former are both cases of *transferring skills*. The latter is a
case of learning new skills *from scratch*.

So at many companies, if they get to a situation where the job changes
in a manner such that you are learning skills "from scratch", it gets
*awfully* tempting to lay the old workers off and hire new ones. Either
way, they have to pay for training. But with new workers, they don\'t
have to pay the *workers* as much.

Most of the moving across states is either a case of there not being
jobs in the local area (or at least not available jobs in what you are
trained for) causing the unemployed to move, or cases of people with
jobs being told that the company is relocating their job to another
location. If they want to keep the job, they have to move.

That latter even applies to things like telephone operators. As the job
gets more automated, the company decides to centralize operations (to
cut costs, it\'s cheaper to have 100 operators in one place than 10
operators in each of 10 places in a multi state area). So they get rid
of jobs in 9 of the places, and offer some of the operators jobs at the
new location. You move, or you don\'t have a job.

Ok, here is where we are going *way* wrong. (IMO). The future is not
likely to be big automated factories in the sense you are thinking of
above. Instead, unless certain trends just starting now are *blocked*,
we\'ll have a sort of "universal fabricator". Any part can be produced
by feeding it specs and raw materials. Eventually, even "assemblies" of
parts will be produced by such.

This makes a crucial change in a lot of things. For one, a "parts
supply" house *won\'t* have an inventory of parts. It\'ll have a file of
manufacturing specs, and a bunch of raw materials. You want a
replacement body panel for your Imperial Year 1100 model XYZ brand
air-raft, and you go looking for a parts house with the specs on file
and their fab unit will kick one out in a few minutes. The charge will
be based on materials used, fab unit time, and a "rental" fee on the
spec. Plus a markup for overhead.

If you want custom parts, you supply the spec file to anybody with a
fab unit big enough. You\'ll get charged for materials and time, and
overhead.

With a big enough fab unit, you could produce entire air rafts. But
there\'ll always be a point where it is easier to produce subassemblies
and put them together "by hand".  So the shipyards have *big* fab
units, and some specialized ones used for making/repairing hulls and
structural members.

This explains both the speed with which starships can be built, and the
big discount for using "standard" plans. (for one thing, they know the
plans don\'t have "glitches" :-)

Some of both.

>And how many of the currently available jobs we accept as necessary

I don\'t see any jobs *ever* becoming *completely* obsolete. For
instance, while there isn\'t a lot of call for blacksmithing, and even
less for flint-knapping, both sets of skills are still being taught,
and some of the folks learning them can make a living at it.
(Mostly in historical recreation, but there are still some instances
where the skills have use)

Yes. For the same reason that all naval and some commercial ships still
have folks with sextants taking star sights are reducing the calcs by
hand. The fancy gear works just fine. But not only is it good to be
able to do without it in an emergency, but it gives you noth a
cross-check on the fancy gear, and a "feel" for whether the answer from
the fancy gear is *right*!

Calculators started getting affordable *after* I got out of high
school. I do know one lady who boasted of the trick she played in high
school. She had a functional (if small) abacus as a bracelet charm and
*used* it during math tests.

And I actually *prefer* using my circular slide rule for comparison
shopping. It\'s much easier than trying to do it on a calculator. (so
much so, that I\'ve joked about trying to market a "shopper\'s friend"
which we\'d be careful *not* to describe as a "slide rule" :-)

I still believe in teaching kids to do it by hand, at least until they
grasp the principles. Then they can use the calculator. One recent
experiment bears this out. They gave a test to a bunch of people and
supplied them with *rigged* calculators. Most of them (80 or 90%)
accepted the answers from the calculator even though they were
completely absurd.

This proves the importance of having *some* sort of "feel" for what the
answer should be.

Sure. It can be done that way. And many, if not *most*, commercial
operations *will* work that way. But the Navy, and some of the more
justifiably paranoid operators *will* have a real astrogator. Just so
that they have a chance if all that fancy hardware goes south due to
accident, sabotage, or combat damage.

Since we don\'t really know what is involved in jump calcs, I can\'t
venture an opinion on those. But real-space manuevers *can* be figured
by hand if you have to, and it\'s not nearly as traumitic as you might
think.

Of course, if you get down to the hand calculator level, things are
pretty bad. On the other hand, if you "sleep" with your calculator,
it\'s a lot harder for something to happen to it.

The current craze for the "latest and greatest" is mostly a consumer
level phenomenon. And even there it shows signs of dieing out.

For a business, the prime considerations are things like being able to
fully depreciate equipment, and cost/benifit ratios. If it takes you 5
years to depreciate something, you are going to have a *loss* on the
books if you replace it before then. And you have to balance the *cost*
of new features against the benefits you can expect to get from them.

In the case of large items of capital equipment, the company is more
likely to *not* want the bells and whistles unless they have a specific
use for them.

For consumer gear, I remember when folks got laughed at when they bough
a foriegn car and then discovered that they couldn\'t get parts easily.

Actually, as I follow thru on the "fab unit" logic detailed above, what
they\'d be shipping would be new specs, unless it was a tech jump that
required a higher tech fab unit.

"Special order" isn\'t all that expensive *if* you have the specs. But I
rather suspect that the manufacturing concerns charge a rather high
price for specs, so as to not get people competing with them.

So for the sake of customer goodwill, if you are going to phase out a
spec (ie remove it from the "stock" set of specs you lease to parts
houses), you have to give ample notice so that the owners of items
using it can either by a copy of the (now discounted) spec, or replace
the gear.

I can easily imagine some *ugly* court cases on this that would require
*years* of advance notice for items distributed off world.

I also suspect that the "parts house" spec sets would be "copy
protected" and set to only be good for the length of the lease. If you
pay extra to *buy* the set, you\'d pay a different price depending on
whether or not it was for "personal" or "commercial" use.

Ships probably have several small fab units, just like contemporary
ships have an extensive machine shop. And this is why the virus might
actually be workable... (though I still don\'t think it was handled
right).

Heck, you get that now with stuff produced by different companies. Ever
try putting a different brand of floppy drive into a laptop? Often, the
cable is *only* long enough to reach the connector. And the other brand
has it on the right side instead of the left. Result? The connectors
match, but you can\'t *reach* them.

Or, with fab units, the latest and greatest stuff *isn\'t* for export,
because that means supporting the specs for decades, and distributing
them all over hell and gone (and parts houses, with only so much space
for the "modules" (tape, disk, whatever) that hold the specs, and
having to pay *annual* rentals on them (or pay huge prices to buy them
outright) only want to have stuff that\'s *likely* to be asked for. So a
few neighboring worlds will have a parts house with specs for the your
ABC computer. Beyond that, you either haver to have the part shipped
(ouch!) or pay for a set of specs (double ouch!).

So stuff from *big* companies can be fixed most anywhere, smaller items
are harder, unless you pay extra for a spec set.

BTW, "custom" doesn\'t cost any more than "standard", if the specs are
available. You just get a better deal on "setup" charges and usage fees
on the fab unit for a longer run. (it\'s a lot easier on the owner to
schedule running off a big batch of the same item, than a bunch of "one
off" items that\'d use the same amount of time).

I don\'t think that "fab units" would change Traveller all that much,
but they *do* rearrange some economic and employment issues. And they
*do* make the "Imperial Standard Tech" packages a lot more
understandable.

make a reasonable judgement call.

This character class is an expansion of the class that appeared in
Citizens of the Imperium.  Please let me know what you think.  The area
that needs the most playtesting, IMO, is the Strike table.  Although
there have been several characters made using this system, that\'s not
enough to really know if the table is too generous, not generous enough,
or just right.

At any rate, enjoy!

                Belters: Mining in the Far Future

     It is felt by this author that the basic character of the
Belter does not do justice to the idea of a "space miner 49\'er".
So, the following system is set out for your perusal.  This is
intended to be used to create both NPCs and PCs, in conjunction
with GDW\'s Traveller rules system.

Choosing Associates

     In the Far Future, mining is done by three different groups:
Companies (which includes governments), Informal Groups, and
Individuals.  The amount of risk entailed varies inversely with
the number of people who are engaged in the task.  Woe betide the
poor person who decides to strike it out on his own.  However,
individual profits for any given strike also vary inversely with
the number of people involved, and thus directly with the amount
of risk (as with any investment).
     A beginning character may enlist in any of the different
types of organizations.  The required enlistment roll for
Company or Group prospecting represents the chance that the
character is accepted.  The enlistment roll for individuals is to
determine whether a patron is acquired.  A patron is necessary
for one-person expeditions in order to cover initial expenses.
The patron then gets a share of any profits.


Initial Activities

     Initial activities include the following:
     Characteristics:  Roll 2D for each of the six
characteristics and record the rolls on a sheet of paper.
     Age:  The character begins at age 18.


                       Beginning the Career

Enlistment:  Characters begin their career by jointing the Belter
organization of their choice.  They may either join a mining
corporation, a small group of individuals, or they may opt to go
it alone.  In each of these instances, the base enlistment roll is
different, but the die modifiers are the same.  These numbers are
given in the tables section of this article.
     Prospecting corporations are owned by their shareholders, the
government, or a combination of both.  On the other hand, informal
groups are a small to moderate sized group of individuals who have
joined together and pooled their resources in order to gain a
chance at a major profit from ore sales.  Finally, there is the
single-handed prospector, who does all the work for his patron,
who in turn pays for all the expenses.  The character and the
patron then share the profits equally.

Terms of Service:  Upon enlistment, the character embarks on a
four-year term of service.  This is done by agreement among the
groups and individuals, or by contract in the case of companies.
However, terms may be cut short by accidents, death, or
dissatisfaction on the part of either party.

Assignments:  The character generation is further divided into
one-year assignments, which are resolved separately using the
tables given.  Survival is determined, skills may be gained, and
a successful mining expedition (called a strike) may be made by
the character (and/or his associates).


                    Definition of Assignments

Claim Jumpers:  A group of claim jumpers is encountered.  They
attempt to steal the Individual\'s, Company\'s, or Groups right to their
mine.  A battle ensues.  Note: If the prior year was spent doing other
than mining, it is assumed that the character spent the first part of the
current year mining.  Alternatively, it can be assumed that the character
(and his associates, if any) is doing the claim jumping.

Mining:  This is what it\'s all about.  The character spends a year
mining the claim, and selling the finds.  A roll is made on the
Strike table, to determine what the strike is worth.  Characters
in groups get a +1 DM to their roll, while characters going it single-
handedly get a +2 DM.  These DMs are given to reflect
profit sharing among the members of the mining party or employees
and shareholders of a company.  The amount of the roll indicates
how much money the character actually gets to keep.

Outfitting:  A year is spent examining the new technologies
available, travelling, making purchases, and having the ship and
equipment inspected and repaired, if necessary.  The character
basically has a year during which he may not prospect, but may
learn a useful skill nonetheless.

Recruitment:  The character spends a year trying to find new
workers to join the organizations.  During this time, the
character may pick up a skill.

Searching:  Possibly the most tedious part of being a belter.  The
character spends an entire year travelling around, looking for a
place to stake a claim. Planetoids and asteroids are scanned,
searched, and analyzed in an attempt to find the one with the best
probability of containing ore.  Then, a mine is made on that one,
and a claim staked.  But, just because a search takes place does
not mean that mining is going to happen the following year.
Claims must be registered, preparations must be made, and
equipment must be made ready.  Also, even if searching is not
rolled, a mining mission may be undertaken in any given year,
because it is assumed that part of that year was spent searching.

Seek New Patron:  A year is spent severing ties with the current
patron and looking for a new one.  Either the present patron
decided to cut all ties, and \'quit while he\'s ahead\', or the
character simply did not like that patron, and terminated his
service.

Transfer Down:  The character is seen as unfit for his present
occupation. Either the Company doesn\'t like him, the group he
is with throws him out, or he decides to leave of his own accord.  The
character may either go to the next lower class of prospector, or
muster out (player\'s choice).

Transfer Up:  The character is given the opportunity to join
either an informal group (if prospecting individually) or a
prospecting company (if prospecting in a group).  If the decision
is made to join, then the character re-rolls for the current year
on the appropriate new assignment table.  If the character decides
that he or she likes the present situation, then a re-roll is made
on the current table.

Reenlistment

     While there is no formal reenlistment roll, reenlistment is a
factor.  If the character is transferred down, that means that he
has not made his enlistment roll, and must either go down in group
classification, or muster out.

Mustering Out

     At the end of the last term, mustering out benefits are
received.  It is possible to receive a ship as a mustering out
benefit.  Receipt of a ship means that the character has the ship
and a 40 year loan.  Each subsequent roll resulting in a ship
pays off 10 years of the loan (and increases the age of the ship by
10 years).
     Unlike the basic character, there are no cash benefit tables
in this enhanced system.  However, there are strike tables.  This is
meant as a replacement.  So, while your character will not
receive mustering out cash, he or she has the chance to earn far
more during his or her career.

Skills

     Some of the skills listed are from the Basic Traveller Rules.
Others are from additional rules booklets, such as Book 4:
Mercenary, and Book 5: High Guard.  See these manuals for the
details on each of the skills.

    'body' => 'Well, my usual Internet connection (hanszen.rice.edu) died a gruesome flaming
death last week, but after a brief hiatus here I am back again at my alternate
address.  I missed you guys!

Looks like much of the furor over the Interstellar Wars has died down, other
than a side discussion about future society and job-changing.  (On that note,
has anybody read Jeremy Rifkin\'s recent THE END OF WORK?  I always thought
he was a bit of a loony, but he\'s got some interesting figures and assertions
in this one, possibly relevant to the current debate (and the recent one!) on
the nature of future societies and economies and the number of hours in a
work-week therein).  So I thought I\'d just slip in my slightly-late two cents:

Phillip McGregor asked about prions as a possible alternate disease source
that could bypass different genetic codes.  I don\'t think we know enough
about what the buggers are and how they work yet (they are, after all, still
theoretical).  BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) seems to cross over
seldom enough to cause KJD (Kreuzfeld-Jakob Disease) (for only a few who are,
most likely, genetically susceptible to it), that I doubt it.  But it\'s
an open question, and individual campaigns may treat it as they see fit.
There would certainly be some diseases (bacteria and parasites) passed back
the other way (Vilani -> Solomani): I just continue to think that the
completely new _character_ of viral infections, amidst the collapse of
their empire and social institutions, would significantly harm the Vilani.

A quick glance through my well-used *Atlas of the Imperium* seems to support
my gut feeling (nothing more -- there\'s hardly enough data to get more
serious over!) that the rimward parts of the Ziru Sirka were far, far less
populated than the coreward portions nearest Vland.  (Why they didn\'t,
then, pour through the gap into Corridor and Deneb is left as yet another
exercise for potential historian-apologists....)  *AotI* isn\'t much but
sparse maps with HiPop worlds named, but it provides some direction.  Sure
enough, near Vland we have many labeled worlds, almost all with Vilaniesque
monikers.  Then there\'s a rapid falloff as we hit the Verge-Delphi belt,
and by the time we hit Daibei-Diaspora-Old Expanses, etc., there are only
a few Vilani-named planets compared to many that are not so:  This could be
evidence either of massive die-off, replacement, and re-naming due to
the Plague of Duskir, or simple sparseness of settlement.  My own view of
the Vilani would tend to support a very far-flung empire, with only the
most habitable worlds settled and the rest limited to mining outposts and
the like (such as Barnard).  This would then add further weight to Terran
resentment: the Vilani are already spread further than they "ought", and
monopolizing habitable worlds while neglecting less-habitable real estate
within their borders.  The inherent  Vilani conservatism and caste-system
also make more-or-less draconian birth control (for the "good of society")
a seemingly likely prospect.  So the true population figures probably lie
far below Phil\'s rather gargantuan totals, and closer to Hans Rancke-Madsen\'s
splendid analysis.

Phillip McGregor\'s excellent point about the problems of sleep-teaching
force-grown Tubers ("clones" only in the sense that they are multiple
copies of a single zygote, not of a single previously-existing adult),
lends more color to my former description of them by the derogatory term
"Spuds."  Though quite human and useful, they will in all likelihood be
recognizable by some speech deficiencies, a rather bland personality due
to their mass-market no-frills electronic upbringing, and a woeful lack
of background and default knowledge on non-essential topics.  The colonists
won\'t really be full-fledged members of the interstellar community until
another generation or two down the line, when enough children have been
raised the "natural" way.  But in the meantime, at least they\'re
industrializing....  Thanks for the campaign color, Phil!

In closing, I agree with Phil that it\'s unlikely that the fledgling Terran
Confederation could have taken on the full might of the Ziru Sirka by
themselves: from what we can see of the canon, it was a combination of
Vilani stasis and decadence, internal dissension and rebellion in the
empire itself, uprisings by previously-oppressed minor races, superior
Terran organization and technology (a la Phil\'s robotic factories, which
I like!), the impact of Terran disease on the Vilani frontier settlements,
and distraction at the Vilani core by the ongoing Vargr incursions.  Gosh,
do you think that\'s enough to fell a major government?  :-)

The boast that the Solomani defeated the Vilani all by themselves, through
greater racial purity or whatnot, is obviously an exaggeration to salve
Party egos.  (And it must be embarassing to take over a thousands-of-years-
old empire and have it fall down around your ears in a mere couple of
centuries....)

As a brief postscript, on the matter of calendars, Classic Traveller\'s
Alien Module 6 (Solomani) provides the following equivalences:

001- +000019 Jan 4521Founding date of the Imperium.
001- +111116 Apr 5631Approximate current date.
111- -2537 1 Feb 1986Random ancient date.

The Belter character class I submitted today had some serious
typographical errors in the assignment resolution tables.  Therefore, I
am releasing this corrected version.  I am very sorry for any
inconvenience this may cause.

By the way, the previously submitted Pirate character class also had some
typographical errors (though none of a serious nature - just misspellings
and such).  If you would like a copy of that posted/emailed, please let
me know.  (As I type these things in, I am keeping a copy of them online,
so if you need a copy of anything I have sent, let me know.)

                    Definition of Assignments

Claim Jumpers:  A group of claim jumpers is encountered.  They
attempt to steal the Individual\'s, Company\'s, or Groups right to their
mine.  A battle ensues.  Note: If the prior year was spent doing other
than mining, it is assumed that the character spent the first part of the
current year mining.  Alternatively, it can be assumed that the character
(and his associates, if any) is doing the claim jumping.

Mining:  This is what it\'s all about.  The character spends a year
mining the claim, and selling the finds.  A roll is made on the
Strike table, to determine what the strike is worth.  Characters
in groups get a +1 DM to their roll, while characters going it single-
handedly get a +2 DM.  These DMs are given to reflect
profit sharing among the members of the mining party or employees
and shareholders of a company.  The amount of the roll indicates
how much money the character actually gets to keep.

Outfitting:  A year is spent examining the new technologies
available, travelling, making purchases, and having the ship and
equipment inspected and repaired, if necessary.  The character
basically has a year during which he may not prospect, but may
learn a useful skill nonetheless.

Recruitment:  The character spends a year trying to find new
workers to join the organizations.  During this time, the
character may pick up a skill.

Searching:  Possibly the most tedious part of being a Belter.  The
character spends an entire year travelling around, looking for a
place to stake a claim. Planetoids and asteroids are scanned,
searched, and analyzed in an attempt to find the one with the best
probability of containing ore.  Then, a mine is made on that one,
and a claim staked.  But, just because a search takes place does
not mean that mining is going to happen the following year.
Claims must be registered, preparations must be made, and
equipment must be made ready.  Also, even if searching is not
rolled, a mining mission may be undertaken in any given year,
because it is assumed that part of that year was spent searching.

Seek New Patron:  A year is spent severing ties with the current
patron and looking for a new one.  Either the present patron
decided to cut all ties, and \'quit while he\'s ahead\', or the
character simply did not like that patron, and terminated his
service.

Transfer Down:  The character is seen as unfit for his present
occupation. Either the Company doesn\'t like him, the group he
is with throws him out, or he decides to leave of his own accord.  The
character may either go to the next lower class of prospector, or
muster out (player\'s choice).

Transfer Up:  The character is given the opportunity to join
either an informal group (if prospecting individually) or a
prospecting company (if prospecting in a group).  If the decision
is made to join, then the character re-rolls for the current year
on the appropriate new assignment table.  If the character decides
that he or she likes the present situation, then a re-roll is made
on the current table.

Reenlistment

     While there is no formal reenlistment roll, reenlistment is a
factor.  If the character is transferred down, that means that he
has not made his enlistment roll, and must either go down in group
classification, or muster out.

Mustering Out

     At the end of the last term, mustering out benefits are
received.  It is possible to receive a ship as a mustering out
benefit.  Receipt of a ship means that the character has the ship
and a 40 year loan.  Each subsequent roll resulting in a ship
pays off 10 years of the loan (and increases the age of the ship by
10 years).
     Unlike the basic character, there are no cash benefit tables
in this enhanced system.  However, there are strike tables.  This is
meant as a replacement.  So, while your character will not
receive mustering out cash, he or she has the chance to earn far
more during his or her career.

Skills

     Some of the skills listed are from the Basic Traveller Rules.
Others are from additional rules booklets, such as Book 4:
Mercenary, and Book 5: High Guard.  See these manuals for the
details on each of the skills.

and CT/MT, but a recent post suggests it was somewhat acrimonious.  I see
no such trend so far in the discussions regarding NT (except that some
people have the temerity to suggest that T4 is a better acronym! :-) (More
on that below). I don\'t think it\'s something we have to worry about.

Here are the possibilities as I see them:

1. A completely new, third list.
This is the most obvious solution, but may be unecessary if many
people on one or both of the existing lists convert to NT.  Too many
lists could result in thinned-out traffic and loss of oportunities to
exchange ideas.

2. Include NT with CT/MT.
My vote is for this.  The xboat list is somewhat smaller than the
TNE list, so it could handle the extra traffic.  Also, the rules for NT
are supposed to be very similar to those for CT/MT, so it makes sense to
put them all together.  TNE/FF&S really is a very different game system
and a fairly different background, and therefore deserves its own separate
list.

3. Multiple lists based on milieu or subject.
I\'m afraid I don\'t like this idea.  It could dilute things, and
makes it difficult to know which list one is supposed to post to.  I like
the idea of a small number of list better, for logistical reasons if
nothing else.

4. One big list for everything.
This would be interesting, I think.  People would have to clearly
label their posts in terms of which era they were referring to, and give
good titles to their posts.  While I\'m on this topic, I would like to ask
everyone to give good descriptive titles to their posts, and to warn if
the post is long.  Thanks.

Are there any other ideas for how to handle this?

AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT...

I like the NT acronym for New Traveller better than T4 for a number of
reasons:

1. "NT" is similar to "CT" and "MT", just as New Traveller is supposed to
be similar to Classic Trav and MegaTrav.  TNE is a very different game and
gets a very different acronym.  I think the risk of confusion is minimal
(oops, there I go underestimating the power of human stupidity again! :-)

2. The new product isn\'t really the fourth edition of Traveller.
There have been many editions of Classic Trav, and there was also
Traveller:2300.

3. (Most importantly!) A "T4" is the income tax form here in Canada, and
it has very bad connotations for me, especially at this time of year! :-).
I\'m not the only one, there are a number of Canadians on the lists.
Please have some sympathy, we\'re the third most taxed people on earth (or
is it second?)!

While I\'m in a facetious mood:

Top Ten Rejected Acronyms For the Latest Traveller Product:

10. T:TENE (Traveller: The Even Newer Era)
9. T:ONYARS (Traveller: Oh no! Yet Another Rules Set!)
8. T:TNTE (Traveller: The Non-Typo Era.  (I hope...))
7. T:TG (Traveller: The Gathering  by Wizzes of the Coast)
6. T:TM (Traveller: The Masquerade  by White Wash Games)
5. BT (BattleTraveller  by FRESCA)
4. T:TNG (Traveller: The Next Generation by whoever does Star Trek RPG)
3. T:TESO (Traveller: The Imperium Strikes Back  by West End)
2. T95: (Traveller \'95  by Microsoft)
Drum roll please Paul to cover up the lousy last one on the list...
1. TL (Traveller Latest, too easy to confuse with Tech Level).

I\'ll stop lurking for a moment and throw in my contribution to this
thread. I have to say, however, that although its quite interesting, I
think its relavence to the digest is probably a little stretched by now.
For anybody wanting a different view on this you should read a book
called "The Player Piano" by Kurt Vonegut, published by HarperCollins. An
excellent story about the effects of technology on society that doesn\'t
quite go the way you expect it to. It beat William Gibson to the idea of
a future ruled by technology by at least a couple of decades and is well
worth reading. Enjoy.

EXACTLY! What I said some time ago, in fact ... but no-one else agreed. Which
makes the enormous cost of items when compared to wages so unbelievably silly!
I would go as far as to say that you will have something like a centralised
"data package" ... probably with regularly updated incorruptable storage (like
a CD-ROM) that has *all* of the specs for *all* of the items produced on a
given planet (or in a given sector, or whatever) and anyone with a MultiFac
(one of the fabricators your\'re proposing) would be able to run off a copy.
In fact, I would guess that one of the requirements of patenting an item would
be that the design go into such storage ... and there would be a licensing
fee automatically paid for using the design.

Now, again, this is where the way I see the future differs from many on this
list - *if* you can do this sort of manufacturing, *then* I see that the
requirements for 5 years to produce a 5000 ton starship are probably way too
long. With computerised "fab" units and a stockpile of raw materials
eliminating much of the delays that are inherent to our present system, the
production time should be reduced by at least an order of magnitude. And the
price should probably be much less ... especially for mass produced items such
as the Air Raft. Starships from common designs get a 10% discount, for example.
We know there are around 30000 Scout/Couriers in the whole Imperium (it says so
in the CT Fighting Ships booklet description of the S/C) ... yet there are
likely to be more than 300,000 Air/Rafts produced on a high tech/high pop
planet in a given year (Starships are good for 40+ years, remember), and there
is no provision in any of the design rules for *any* discount for such mass
production and the amortization of design costs across a much larger number of
units, nor is there an allowance for the savings due to experience in producing
the design, nor for bulk purchase of materials.

Good point. What I really mean, of course, is jobs in widespread *day to day*
use for general "consumption".

very much so, in fact!

Some interesting ideas.

first: in the NPC appearance rules you have a 2D roll for comelyness

characteristic (or an MT or TNE one: I recently obtained copies of
these but have not yet had time to read----I am, and think I always
will be a CT man----but we\'ll see what:  TRAVELLER: WAY BEFORE THE
NEW ERA has to offer)?  Is it a seventh characteristic added to the
basic six?  If its something not covered elsewhere; could you explain
how "comelyness" is used in game terms?

also:  the "letter" received a mustering out benefit for your
Pirate Generating system: what is it?

Thanks for posting these Joe!  I can see that a fair amount of work
went into them and I\'m glad you are sharing it with the rest of us.

                         Pirates of Space

     In Traveller, Pirates play a big part in everyday space life.
The Imperium and the other governments are always on the lookout
for this, the scourge of space.  The pirates are
outlaws who have taken to attacking and plundering honest ships,
most especially traders.  As trade is the lifeblood of all
governments throughout space, pirates tend to be the most hated of
all criminals.
     It is rare, however, that a pirate will attack government-
owned ships.  Nor will they routinely attack ships bearing the
insignia of one of the Mega Corporations.  Both of these
activities are much too risky for the average pirate.
     Pirates generally focus the thrust of their activities on
free traders and small merchant companies.  These ships yield the

     This article deals with creating a character who is a member
of this "underground" organization.  It presents a step-by-step
process of fleshing out a complete Pirate character in the
tradition of Mercenary, High Guard and Scouts (q.v.).


                    Character Creation Process

     First, create the basic Traveller character by throwing 2D
for each of the six characteristics (Strength, Dexterity,
Endurance, Intelligence, Education and Social Standing), noting
the scores on a sheet of paper.
     The second step is to make the enlistment throw.  A throw of
7+ is required, with a +1 DM for a Social Standing score of 7- and
a +2 DM for Endurance 9+.
     Next, determine the type of organization the character is
joining.  Roll 2D6: two through five results in a Solitary Ship
Group, meaning that it is a relatively small organization, with
only one ship, probably hovering near one major world in a system;
six through nine results in the character being part of a small
group of ships, probably preying only on those who venture into
its\' two-or three-parsec territory; ten through twelve results in
being accepted into an Organized Crime ring, which may be as big
as a subsector, a sector, or even larger.  Whichever organization
is determined is used for the entire career.
     Fourth, determine where the character is stationed.  A roll
(1D) of one through five results in the character being on a ship
for the term.  A roll of six means the character has been caught,
and will spend the term in Prison, thereafter being mustered out
of the Pirates.  Stationing is only rolled at the beginning of
each term.
     During each year of the term, rolls will be made on the
appropriate assignment determination table.  Once the assignment
has been determined, make the appropriate rolls on the
corresponding assignment resolution table.  Note the results, such
as skills (which should be rolled immediately) and promotions on a
sheet of paper.  Once all four years have been completed in this
manner, go back through the steps, starting with re-enlistment,
and complete as many terms as wanted (or until the character is
put in prison).


                    Definition of Assignments

Crew:  The character is a member of the normal crew, and performs
tasks necessary on any starship, such as navigation, piloting and
acting as medic.

Boarding:  The character is a member of a boarding party, and will
see mostly combat action.  The character will have several
opportunities for physical self-improvement.

Slaving:  The character is on the slave training, disciplining and
trading end of pirate life.

Guarding:  The character acts as security guard on board ship, and
may even be a personal guard to an officer.

Mines:  The character works in the dangerous mines on planets with
horrible climates.

Factory:  The character pays for his offenses by producing useful
items for the public he has wronged.

Detention Camps:  The character is held in a prison-like detention
camp, in which he may gain useful every-day skills.

Cells:  Solitary confinement.  The character sees no one and does
nothing.  Essentially, it is a year of the character\'s life that
is wasted.


                            New Skill

Concealment:  The ability to hide objects on or about one\'s person
during a search.  At the highest level, objects may be concealed
from even the most thorough searches.


                          Mustering Out

When mustering out of the Pirate ranks, follow the rules in
Traveller Book 1 with the following exceptions:

Letter:  If the character spent at least one full term working for an
Organized Crime ring of Pirates, then the character has received an
encoded letter from the leader of that organization, entitling him to
seek refuge on any ship controlled by that Organized Crime ring.  This
letter is non-transferable.
If, on the other hand, the charater has never served in an
Organized Crime ring, the player should re-roll this result.

Corsair:  The character has posession of a Corsair, as described in the
Benefits section of Supplement 4, Citizens of the Imperium.

Here is the last of my house rules which I plan to release at this time.
It is also the biggest of the rules (as my poor, tired fingers can
attest!:).  While there is not much background information given (as with
my other character classes), the character creation process itself is, I
believe, as robust as any official class.

Nonetheless, as with all previous house rules I have released, this class
was still only used in my own campaigns.  Therefore, it probably has some
aspects that will not work in all campaigns.  If you see any such, please
let me know the details (hopefully including a solution you have worked
out).

Enjoy!

===============
                              Spies

     Espionage in the far future, for the most part, is done on a
much wider scope than it once was.  The Imperium spies on the
Zhodani, the Vargr, the Hivers and all the other major and minor
races in the known universe.  This takes a very highly trained
group of people, of course.  The Imperium has its own agency, the
Imperial Investigative Agency (IIA).  The personnel in this branch
of the government are experts in their field, and highly respected
by most other branches of the government.  They are the ones who
are sent to get the Imperium out of delicate or embarrassing
situations.
     On the non-public side, they are also the ones who put other
governments into delicate or embarrassing situations.  Their
people are infiltrated within most other governments, as other
governments\' agents are assumed to be in the Imperial beaurocracy.
     It is into this web of intrigue that a spy goes daily.  He or
she may do things that could either result in his or her single-
handedly saving the Imperium, or on the other side of the coin,
destroying it.
     The following is a character generation system for use with
Traveller, GDW\'s science fiction game set in the far future.  It
was created to be used for making IIA agents, but, with a few
minor adjustments, could be usable for other governments\' agents
as well.

Character Generation:

     First, roll up the six characteristics, as usual.
     Second, roll for enlistment.  The chance is 7+.
     Third, define whether the current mission is combat or non-
combat.  This is done once per term, at the beginning of the term.
     Fourth, determine the mission.
     Fifth, determine the type of mission.
     Sixth, go to the Assignment Resolution Table which
corresponds to the specific mission determined above, and cross-
reference the assignment type.  Make the necessary rolls, noting
the results on the character sheet or scratch paper.  Roll skills
on the selected skill table as necessary.
     Seventh, repeat steps four through six each year, and step
three at the end of each four-year term, until the character
wishes to muster out (or is refused reenlistment).
     Eighth, using the Rank Table, determine the number of rolls
allowed in mustering out.  Use the mustering out tables to
determine which cash, material, and/or intellectual benefits are
granted.  Note any automatic skills received according to the rank
of the character.


                            New Skills

Concealment:  The ability to hide small objects on or around one\'s
body during a search.  At the highest levels of this skill,
objects may be concealed even during the most thorough of
searches.

Cryptography:  The ability to encode and decode messages.  Figure
the skill of the encoder as a negative DM when attempting to
decode.  Encoding typically takes 1D6 weeks, and is automatically
successful.

                           Skill Tables

     To use the skill tables, roll on the table that corresponds
to the mission the character is currently on.  Record the skill
rolled on the character sheet. Gun Combat, Blade Combat, Vice, and
Vehicle need further detailing to be completed immediately upon
getting that skill.

                      Assignment Definitions

Training:  A completely school-like setting, with no field work.
However, some of the simulations and exercises do involve some
small element of risk.

Routine:  An assignment requiring few risks, little originality,
and little skill.

Mission:  This sort of assignment is considered respectable,
usually entailing a good amount of skill.  Missions are usually
somewhat risky.

War Time Mission:  This assignment requires a lot of skill and
originality.  War Time Missions are highly risky.

Top Secret Mission:  These are considered the most adventurous
assignments, and often are the subject of fictional novels and
holovision.  An extreme amount of skill and daring are called for.
These assignments are extremely risky.


                       Mission Definitions

Assassination:  This is the systematic killing of a person,
usually a dignitary, noble, or some form of politician.

Blackmail:  This entails obtaining some embarrassing or valuable
information and requiring the person it concerns to pay money or
to perform to the blackmailer\'s specifications.

Breaking and Entering:  This entails breaking into an
establishment, obtaining some goods or information, and exiting,
all unnoticed.

Counter-Intelligence:  Giving false leads to the enemy.  Acting as
a double agent.

Cryptography:  The encoding and decoding of messages. May be done
on the battle front, and makes one a prime target for assassins.

Infiltration:  Getting in good standing with the enemy government,
learning and reporting its secrets, or destroying it from within.

Interrogation:  Questioning of captives through electronic lie
detectors and/or torture.

Rescue:  This is the recovering of a person or persons who have
been captured by the enemy.

Surveillance:  The actual detailed observation of a person or
establishment in order to glean information.

Transfer to Combat:  The character has been transferred to combat
duty for the remainder of the term.

I just wanted to add my comments to Mr. Collin\'s assessment of
this situation.  We should reach a concensus on this as soon as we can,
so that the transition (whatever it may be) can go smoothly.
Anyway . . .

When I subscribed to both lists, I subscribed to xboat in the way
that causes each message to arrive individually, as they are sent.  I
subscribed to the Traveller list in digest format, thinking there
wouldn\'t be much of interest to me on a TNE mailing list.
Within a week, I changed the Traveller list to be on a
single-message basis as well.  This was becuase much of what they were
saying was of interest to me.
Already, I am beginning to wish the two lists were one.  To add a
third would make it even more difficult to communicate efficiently with
all Traveller enthusiasts.
In short, I agree with your assessment here.

I could handle this.  It\'s not a perfect solution, but the
perfect solution of having all Traveller-related traffic (no matter which
rules system one is using) on one list is only possible if everyone can
get along,and if people use very detailed, complete subject lines.  I
don\'t know how likely all of that is, so this option is probably the
easiest to implement.

I agree (see my first response).

This would be great, but, as I said above, I have doubts that it
would work in reality.


> Are there any other ideas for how to handle this?

I think you covered it (other than putting NT with TNE, which,
from the description of NT, would be counter-intuitive).

I finally have to take issue with you Phil.

 (I followed the lengthy debates you were having on other subjects until I
felt I had better get on with my own life!  Where do you get
the time?)

"information worker" is most certainly not a different way of
saying "office worker" or even "clerk".

I work in a library, have an honours degree in library and
information science and for lack of a better word would
describe myself as a librarian or an information specialist.

Not only do I take exception to being called an \'clerk\' (I do
work in an office though!), I think you are
misunderstanding a lot of what is involved in my (and
related) professions.

It is true that a lot of the non-professional staff in
libraries are fairly \'replaceable\' by mechanised means.
Witness the Swedes implementing automated issue and return
schemes in public libraries.  That will take place more and
more.  There is nothing intrinsically difficult about
\'stamping a book\'.

However, contrary to popular opinion, professional librarians
do an awful lot more than \'stamp books\'.  (In fact, I don\'t
even get to do this in my current job!).

The Information service we provide to library users is
heavily dependent on very specialised knowledge that we have
developed over time with training and experience that is
extremely hard to replicate with artificial intelligence.

One of the reasons that the Internet is currently so chaotic
is that classifying subject content is a specialised skill
that the British Library will admit is not easy (hence CIP -
Cataloguing in Print - data not quite catching up with the
books it is supposed to be contained in!).  Anyone who has
tried to catalogue their own books (or CDs or whatever for
that matter) will have come across some of the problems involved.

Enquiry work, stock selection and maintainance, staff liason
(in an academic environment) and promotion of resources are
all jobs that automation will not handle for sometime to
come.  This is true whether we are talking about traditional
materials (e.g. books) or new technologies such as the
Internet.

In Traveller, libraries (and librarians) are one aspect of
the universe that are just a wee bit overlooked.  There seems
to be an assumption that the masses of \'library data\' that is
provided is easily accessible wherever you are - whether it
is a nearby computer terminal or a \'library\' a few hundred
miles away.  There is no consideration made of TLs of various
worlds, information access, censorship, availabilty etc. etc.
etc.  (One of the Journals had a brief article on the
subject).

Funnily enough I am in the process of making my own minor
contribution to the genre with "Book 9: Libraries and Librarians"
 [working title - if anyone can suggest anything better let me know!]
along the lines of the original Traveller black books.  It includes
 \'Librarian\' character generation, a ULP (Universal Library Profile)
 to describe the library/info facilities of any world visited and some
scenarios etc to show that librarians are not the dullards
some like to take us for!  If I can get this little lot into
some sort of shape, and there is any interest, I\'ll let you
know.

I\'ve gone on long enough but I couldn\'t let Phil\'s comment
pass!

My vote would also be for this solution. Like Joe Walsh I also subscribed
to the TNE list in digest format, unlike him I cancelled my subscription
to it...

thought you should know kinda stuff.

First, we will probably be moving the mailing list from our offices in New
York to our offices in Key West.  This could happen as early as today.  For
you, it should be pretty transparent.  We are going to switch to majordomo
as part of the change.  We will probably alias listproc to go to the right
place for subscribe/signoff commands.  Certain commands such as SET MAIL ACK
and stuff
wont work.  You will still use traveller@mpgn.com and xboat@mpgn.com to
communicate with the list.

Because of this, and the fact that we are busy with all these equipment
moves, I have not processed any address changes or other administrative
requests in several days.  I will probably clean these up during the
transition between servers.

With regards to what to do with the lists.  Alot of what to do with the list
depends on what actually comes out of the new Traveller system and the
reason for Xboat in the first place.

Regardless, "Traveller" will be to discuss the game in all forms, and will
naturally discuss the current shipping products.  Call it evolution, or what
ever.  Thats the purpose of the list, and that is not going to change.

Xboat was created for the refugees from Classic Traveller that felt that the
current Traveller was not for them.  If the new Traveller brings the Classic
Traveller\'s back into the mainstream, then Xboat\'s mission is less
important.  Probably though, the TNE exiles will need a home.  Xboat\'s
charter could be changed, but I would be inclined to leave Xboat alone, and
let it die of attrition while creating a list for the TNE folks to continue
to discuss TNE.  Maybe we could call it RCES or someother recognizable TNE
based word that would not be misleading to the non-Traveller savvy public
(i.e. no list called virus@mpgn.com).

I personally am going to be in a wait and see mode until August when this
stuff hits the streets.  We can then discuss what we want to do with the
lists.

So for the immediate future, please use "Traveller@mpgn.com" for discussing
the new Traveller.   Should traffic warrent changes before the products
release in August, we can work on a list for the TNE fans.

	Recent discussions of the fate of this mailing list when the new 
Traveller rules come out have mentioned how things have changed in the 
hobby since "way back when."  This made me think of the first few times I 
played Traveller, and how those affected my life.  I\'d like to hear from 
those of you who have fond memories of those first few times as well.  If 
you\'d rather not share it with the rest of those who read the mailing 
list, email would be fine.  But I think it would be interesting if we got 
to know each other better this way.  [If this has already been done to 
death, let me know!]

	I have mentioned previously that I came to the hobby, like many, 
through D&D.  When I first acquired D&D, we played it almost every day 
for several months.  Even so, our campaigns weren\'t much more than hack 
\'n slash.  Heck, at first I had so little concept of what an RPG was that 
I set up a dungeon, sent the characters through it, then as they died I 
let them come back to life at the beginning of the dungeon up to three 
times each, in a manner similar to video games of the time!  
	I got past that, and thought I was getting to be a pretty good 
role-player in general, and a good DM in particular.  Until I ran into 
Traveller.
	It happened this way:  I was reading Dragon Magazine in class, 
and the guy sitting next to me noticed.  He invited me to play with his 
group, and I accepted.  I wasn\'t nervous about joining another group for 
an evening of role-playing; I figured I was as good a role-player as the 
next 8th grade kid.  Hoo, boy, was I wrong.
	Although I had gone beyond the "RPG\'s are video games with paper 
and pencils" stage, I still hadn\'t progressed beyond the hack \'n 
slash/Monty Hall campaign style.  
	When I arrived at this guy\'s house, I met the group.  They all 
made me welcome, and helped me create a Gamma World character [Be 
patient...Traveller comes in later.].  Gamma World was new to me, so I 
needed a lot of help understanding the world, the characters, etc.  But, 
I figured it was role-playing, and role-playing is role-playing, so I 
shouldn\'t have a problem.
	As the game began, I realized I wasn\'t prepared at ALL for these 
people\'s conception of role-playing.  There wasn\'t a single combat the 
whole session!  They wandered around the wastelands, discovering a few 
odd artifacts, dealing with radiation, and /interacting with NPCs in a 
non-combative way/!  
	Within about an hour, the GM said he hadn\'t really been prepared 
for the evening\'s adventure, so perhaps we should try another game.  In 
reality, I think he simply realized I was totally lost, and wanted to 
spare me.  
	He brought out a game that was comprised of a few little black 
books. He asked if I\'d ever played Traveller.  I said no, which was the 
response he was undoubtedly hoping for.  He replied, "Maybe it would be 
better if you sit to the side and watch us play, then, so you can learn 
the system."  I thought, "Man, this must be a very complex system, 
then!"  Of course, he was just trying to give me a chance to see how REAL 
role-playing was done.
	So I sat there, and I learned.  I didn\'t know it at the time, of 
course.  All I thought was, "Wow, what a cool game!"  I had more fun 
watching them play than I ever had when /I/ played!  
	When I went home that evening, I knew I wanted to buy Gamma World 
and Traveller.  I believed it was the /games/ which were more fun than 
D&D.  I hadn\'t yet figured out it was the role-players who had made it so 
fun.
	At the end of the month, when I had the money from my paper 
route, my best friend and I went to the games store and purchased Gamma 
World (second edition, I believe) and Deluxe Traveller (the Starter Set 
booklets, Adventure 0, An Introduction to Traveller, and the Spinward 
Marches map).  My best friend, Will, decided to "DM" Traveller, and I 
decided to take on Gamma World.
	We played those games that way for a while, then went back to D&D 
for a while.  It wasn\'t as much fun as it had been with that other gaming 
group.  For some reason which slips my mind, we decided to swap GM jobs.  
I took Traveller, he took Gamma World.
	And you know what?  It worked.  The games got more lively, and we 
had a ton of fun in both.  He took Gamma World to places never imagined 
by the designers.  I, on the other hand, turned Traveller into a mixture 
of a soap-opera and an action movie.  Both approaches worked.
	But I think more than the scenario, our growth as gamers had 
improved the fun factor.  Over the summer after 8th grade, which is when 
we finally returned to those two games and traded GM jobs, we had finally 
matured enough as gamers to experience the heady rush that comes with 
\'living\' the role.
	After that great Gamma World campaign, we never returned to it.  
We realized a few things:  1) Will enjoyed being player more than 
being GM (although he did GM other systems occasionally from then on, but 
never again Traveller or Gamma World), 2) I enjoyed being Referee more 
than I enjoyed being a player, and 3) Traveller was the best system for us.
	Never before, and never since, did we find a better system, though we 
looked high and low, trying more than 30 different systems over the next 
10 years.  Maybe it was the fact that our /real/ role-playing abilities 
kicked in when we found Traveller that caused us to see that system as 
the best.  I don\'t really know.
	Sure, it is an emotional attachment I have to Traveller, but I 
think it is more than that.  I like to think that classic Traveller is 
simply the right system for me.
	As I look back, I am grateful to that group of gamers who showed 
a cocky novice what a /real/ role-player is like.

Hi folks

I\'m writing a scenario (that I expect will turn into a
campaign) set on the world of Arden in the
Spinward Marches.

I would like to try and keep this material within the
existing canon as far as possible.  I have consulted
all the sources that I have at my disposal (Spinward
Marches, Library data, Regency Sourcebook)
that at least cover the area.  I was wondering if any
of you knew of any information relating specifically
to Arden that exists outside of these?  I\'m referring
to anything from scenarios to snippets of information
about names of cities etc. (pref. 1110 or earlier)

If you know of anything I\'d be grateful if you could
e-mail me with the name of the publication so I can
try and track it down (or if it\'s only a little bit of info,
perhaps you could just let me know what it is...)
Thanks a lot.

By the way, in all the discussion about new lists and
names for the new incarnation of Traveller, and in the
light of the ongoing CT/TNE schism,  I\'m surprised
that nobody\'s mentioned:

Traveller 4: The Empire Strikes Back ....
;-)

Cheers

Iain

    'body' => 'I remember quite clearly my first encounter with Traveller: September 1983.
I had been playing D&D and AD&D for 2 years, and then we moved to Eagle
Rive, a suburb of anchorage. I didn\'t know anybody, and had just started
high school. I saw this group playing, and spent a week sitting nearby. Two
of the guys playing rode the same bus home, and invited me to play.
        That next monday, Rick (the GM) broke out his hand copied tables, I
rolled up my very first 6 term scout. Boarded a tramp freighter, and we all
got jumped by Zhos!

I sson discovered that Nobody in the group owned a copy of the rules! (Rick
had em memorized! From the Traveller book at the local Game Keeper shop!)

My parents kept hearing me talk about the games at lunch, the wide
assortemtn of characters, and NO MONSTERS!!! (Well, one, but it was my PC,
FAF113, Army 2 terms, big alien blob. Died of "indigestion" from eating a
police robot)

That Christmas (83) my folks got me Deluxe Traveller (Bk0-3 + Adv0
version), the Traveller Book (which I just recovered from a friend who\'s
had it for 4 years now), and Spacemaster. I was the first to own the rules,
so soon rick had me GMing...

If anybody knows Rick Singleton... Tell him I said Thanks for the fond
memories, and slightly bent version of the Imperium he gifted his entire
group with.

This was the only thing I could find:

"A Guide to the Domain of Deneb" MTJ #1:

"Arden, Federation of: The independent, human-inhabited state of the =

I know that the game definitely places restrictions on how difficult
it is to find Combat Armor and Battle Dress for purchase (no open
market), but what I\'d like to hear some opinions on are this.
Assuming that Joe Merc finds someone who sold him Combat Armor, what
is the likelihood that a High Law Level world would allow him to wear
it.  I\'ve always felt that the higher test detectable armors (i.e.
you can tell when they\'re wearing it), should be restricted on high
law level worlds, and have run my games accordingly...I wanted to
know if anybody else did the same thing?

Geez, Joe...where have you been hiding all these months?  After all
these arguments about CANON  (or is that CANNON?), here you are
posting all these wonderful house rules, new character classes, and a
neat first experience article.  Clearly you don\'t belong on this
mailing list ;-)

Anyways, I thought I\'d let you know what made me gravitate the game.
My first RPG experience, as I would imagine is true of most people,
was D&D.  I was 14, and was invited to play a game with a number of
other high schoolmates who for the most part were older and more
experienced than I was.

The GM that I had was rather good, and made his games lively and yet
thought provoking.  My first character was a Paladin who was killed
off rather sadistically in the opening session.  I played D&D once in
a while after that, but never got all that excited about it.  I don\'t think
I\'ve played the game in any form in about 10 years.

It was about 2 years later that I first discovered Traveller.  In the
intervening time, I had become an avid wargamer, had loved Star Wars,
and had started reading a lot of Asimov, Heinlein, Bradbury, etc...
One day, when I went by the hobby shop, with money earned from the
part-time job I worked, I had the intent of buying a wargame, when I stumbled
upon a black box with the "Mayday, Mayday, This is Free Trader Beowulf...
etc.) on the box and picked it up.  To be honest I had no concept
that somebody would actually write a SCIENCE FICTION RPG.
The text on the back cover sounded intriguing, so I picked
it up.  Frankly, the rules themselves didn\'t turn my crank, but the
thought of writing adventures based on a lot of the science fiction
concepts I\'d been reading really turned my crank.  A couple of months
later, I had a few people over, and ran Twilight\'s Peak, which is
still IMHO the best adventure that GDW ever published for the
game.  Well...we were all hooked.  Although I\'ve since tinkered with
a number of RPG\'s (most of which are covered with an inch of dust in
my bookcase), I still find myself going back to the game.  I played a
lot for the next 3 years 1980-1984, when most of my players moved
away.  I\'ve never actually played the game as a player to be honest.

Fortunately, I married somebody who is into RPG\'s and got her and a
friend of mine who was still in town back into the hobby.  We\'ve
played on and off since 1988.  I now run a completely different
couple of people as well as my wife through a bunch of stuff.  I
recently introduced somebody else who\'d been an AD&D player for a
long time to the game.  He now continuously asks me when we\'re going
to get together to continue the campaign I\'m running.

The average size of the groups I run have been 3-6 players.  I\'ve
currently got 3.  I run a hybrid CT/MT rules system, using the Combat
& Design systems of MT, with a CT background.  I like the MT & TNE
eras, but just haven\'t built a campaign for them yet.  You may find
this interesting, but I run the game currently with my wife and
another couple (2 women, 1 guy).  I find the SF mililieu, as long as
it doesn\'t go the hard SF way, actually is more appealing to women
than a typical D&D hack and slash.  My adventures tend to run heavy
on Alien encounters, heavy on political intrigue, and light on
combat.  I doubt if the characters fight a 1/2 dozen battles in a
typical campaign of mine, other than possible random encounters.
Yes, its space opera, but its FUN.  :-)

I have no intention of ever using the TNE combat system, which I feel
has a tendency to create characters that are near superheros.
Especially, when they usually come blazing up in Battle Dress, armed
with PGMP-13\'s and find themselves facing militia quality troops
armed with Auto Rifles, and if their lucky dressed in Cloth.   I like
characters that can die easily if they think with their Laser Pistol
instead of their mind, and therefore don\'t intend to use TNE combat
rules, even if I do run a TNE adventure.  I\'m of the opinion that
trashing the CT/MT rules system probably hurt GDW as much as forcing
people to chuck their existing campaigns did.  I\'m sure there are
others who disagree, and that\'s fine.

There are worlds, whole _worlds_, where a flint knapper or charcoal burner or

Possibly not. Digression, I suppose. But anyway, skills won\'t die out if there\'s

I wonder how many other role-players ran into the "role-playing

while having some misgivings, didn\'t protest very much about my hobby.

I never did put restrictions on the use of armor.  I ruled that
it was not a dangerous item, therefore governments wouldn\'t bother those
who owned Combat or Battle Dress (even though they might restrict or ban
its sale).

In retrospect, that probably wasn\'t the most logicl ruling I ever
made.  If I were to change that ruling, I would state that those items
are illegal on any world with a high law level.  Your ruling makes more
sense.

[grin]  Actually, I had heard of the xboat and Traveller mailing
lists, but had only had previous experince with digest format mailing
lists.  I wasn\'t too fond of that format, so never bothered to sign up.
Then I heard that one could request mailing list submissions be sent as
separate emails.  That made me want to sign up.
I wish I hadn\'t missed all the previous discussions!  Ah, missed
opportunities.

Yikes!  Sadism like that wouldn\'t compel me to play much, either!

As an aside, Will and I had a recurring routine where one would
begin with, "Mayday, Mayday, this is Free Trader Beowulf," and the other
would respond, "Free Trader Beowulf, this is Starport Authority.  You\'re
only two inches away from the stardock, so quit panicking!  Geez!"  Oh,

Hmm.  While I own 12 of the 14 Adventures, I have never run a
single published Traveller adventure.  I\'ll have to re-read Twilight\'s
Peak and see what we missed!

Being a Traveller referee is a pleasure.  I feel a sense of
freedom when refereeing that game that I don\'t feel with other systems.
I can decide to use the basic rules for world building, or the Scout
system, or the one published by DGP, depending on how detailed I want to
get.  For trading, I can use the basic rules or Merchant Prince.  And on
and on.

Thanks for sharing your tale.

Continuing with Joe\'s "first time I laid eyes on it" thread:

Pretty boring for us:  we stated playing Starfleet Wars at school at
lunch.  Then a friend of mine brought in Traveller and we started
playing that.  Yes we were young and foolish (one of my favorite things
to do was to go to planets which had just achieved nuclear power and
blast them from orbit.  Doning Vacc Suits I would decend to the planet\'s
now radioactive surface and relieve it of its precious metals........
ah young, foolish, and not knowing any better.)  From this humble beginning
we proceded to get more into the spirit of Traveller--to the point where
we looked with distain upon my friend\'s little sister\'s adventure (she so
wanted to play) which consisted of wave after wave of nasties until
finally all the PC were dead and which point she said "I won".

In the end however we finally worked out how role playing was supposed
to work and despite our shakey start I have been enjoying Traveller
ever since.  Its been only one of two games I\'ve ever played seriously.
(I was glad to see in Joe\'s post that I and my high school friend were
not the only people who enjoyed TSR\'s GAMMA WORLD.)

So that\'s it....pretty dull....We have had our moments though.  Chad,
if your out there, I will never forget, "Your ship shudders and goes
off coarse......but you don\'t notice it."........

My parents never thought that they were evil, although they did want to
limit the ammount of time I spent on them In Jr High I got into the "Brand
new" AD&D; I was 10 at the time. My parents were remarkably enlightened
about the whole thing: My father is a civil servant and a Roman Catholic
Deacon (Yes, he has his preaching faculties), and my mother was working on
a masters in Counseling Psych. They DID check with a noteable cult
specialist (Rev. Kent Burtner, OP) before giving an unreserved OK to RPG\'s;
He, as pastor of the local cathedral allowed us to have a gaming group meet
in the parish center, with adult supervision (21+) for insurance reasons,
and with the proviso that no players run Evil PC\'s.

Especially because Rick described things in such a manner that I got the
beastie\'s viewpoint, without the filter of "human" understanding. He didn\'t
tell me it was a robot, but a cold, hard-shelled creature that attacked me.
So I\'d eaten a child, with stroller, a pet dog, a cop, and a panicked

Doing the "alien\'s eye view" descriptions can be difficult, but
very rewarding, as you attested.  The first time I ran into it was in the
Gamma World game I previously mentioned.  The GM was describing what, for
the players, were modern objects, but which for the characters were
alien/pre-blast artifacts.  Trying to figure out that the box with one
glass side is a television was fun! :)
The next time I encountered this was in one of the books of Piers
Anthony\'s Kirlian Quest seires.  In one of the books, a human is
transplanted into the body of an alien who is an amoeba-like creature
about the size of a medium dog.  When the character, who has been living
as an amoeba for some time, encounters a human the description is
something like: "a huge being that looks like wax has been dripping down
its body."
I\'ve only rarely had the opportunity to use this sort of
description in a role-playing setting, but I\'d like to do more of it.
The Aliens modules do a lot to give one the perspective of the various
alien races that live in the Traveller universe, but they do not do
much to show what they think of the races of Humaniti, and the other
non-human races.
Perhaps the new traveller will go into more detail in this respect.

Whee!  :)  That must have been fun, even if it wasn\'t "in the
spirit of Traveller (whatever that is)."

A point in my role-playing education which was skipped in the
previous post is this:
I bought the game, "Universe," from the book store.  The first
time I GM\'d it, I didn\'t understand the game at all.  I took one of the
stock encounters (the game had this rather interesting idea: each
creature had a different description of what the character would
hear/see/smell at the different encounter ranges) and read the
descriptions for each encounter range, vebatim.  Unfortunately, I had
chosen something like a giant slug, which nearly killed the PC.  After
that, I randomly selected another creature and started reading the
description.  At this point, the PC turned his gun on himself and pulled
the trigger.
We never played that game again, and had much disdain for it.
Which is probably unfair, as the game was probably fine if played
correctly.
I think the little sister you described above would have related
to my GMing style in that RPG, though. :)

It is my opinion that had Gamma World and Boot Hill (and,
possibly, Gangbusters!) been produced by a different company, they would
have been huge hits.  At the time they were introduced, there was a true
paucity of role-playing genres.  TSR tried to fill that void, but while
their ideas were good, their implementation downright stunk.  TSR\'s era
of "grab a well-known setting, slap some rules on it, and sell it" games
was not a glorious one for the RPG industry, IMO.  But each system had
something about it that was very attractive (ie, in Gamma World, the
mutations and the whole idea of the wasteland scenario (which was, I
hear, done better in the Marrow Project, but I have never owned that)).
Too bad they didn\'t produce a larger rule set for each of those games.
64 pages isn\'t nearly enough.

I do not yet own all the items listed, nor do I own all editions of each

The games I run are rather "high level" as far as resource goes, so our Joes
have access to the tin suits. The mechanic we adopted was the Official Mercenary
Unit registration. It works like this. Group of PCs with a small ship (Iylvir
works a treat), couplea tanks, BD et al, set up as a merc outfit. Along with
registering their company name, they apply to the Home Port world for mercenary
registration. It\'s a bit like a gun licence (OK I\'m a Limey!), in that it allows
them to trade in and possess military hardware.

Obviously, the further from home you go, the less likely the locals are to be
impressed by this. But where the licence is accepted, the personnel get far more
lattitude in wandering around in armour and carrying weapons.

Unless they _use_ anything.

If there is trouble, and the mercs have\'nt a really good story as to why it
ain\'t their fault, they get blitzed with the full force of the law, and their
licence revoked. And bounty hunters sent after them, arms merchants (like the
MegaCorps!) warned off them, etc, etc.

It does seem to work!

IMO you\'re right. The publication of MT was certainly full of bugs, but the

Combat armour is fine, but BD is powered, meaning trouble. Work out the results
of hitting someone with a fist in 3x Str battledress and you\'re looking at
brains on the walls. Like Mel Gibson, battledress is a lethal weapon - even
without its\' many add-ons.

said that, some of the mail I\'m getting indicates that I may not have
been clear enough in my initial post.   Here are the options again, with
extra explanations.  Also please observe the subject line protocol I
have outlined below.  I check the text of each mail as it comes in, but
it will be easier come counting time if everyone does the following:

Read the following list of options about the future of TML/XTML mailing
lists, and send me email indicating your preference. My address is:

charles@hebb.psych.mcgill.ca

IMPORTANT:  The message subject line should be "Survey: Option x", where x
is the number of your preferred option.  If you have already sent me a
vote that was not in this format, please send in another and make it clear
in the body of the letter that this is a second vote so I don\'t count you
twice.  Thanks. Additional comments are welcome, but please make the
subject line as indicated.

Voting Options:

1. Leave Traveller and Xboat alone, create new mailing list for New
Traveller.  This would mean three lists, one for CT/MT, one for TNE, and
another for NT.

2. Leave lists as are, but discuss New Traveller on Xboat.  This would
mean two lists, one for CT/MT/NT and another for TNE.

3. Leave lists as are, but discuss New Traveller on Traveller.  This
would mean two lists, one for CT/MT, and one for TNE/NT.

4. Leave lists as are, and discuss New Traveller on either/both.  This
would mean two lists, one for CT/MT/NT, and another for TNE/NT.

5. Create single list for all game versions (CT/MT/TNE/NT).

6. Create several lists divided by topic, such as technology, history,
rules, etc.

7. Create new list for TNE, discuss New Traveller on Traveller, and leave
Xboat for CT/MT.  This is similar to option 1, except that the TML
retains its charter as a forum for discussing the latest Traveller version.

8. Other (please specify).

Just a reminder: I\'m "closing the poll" April 30th, so get those votes in
soon.

I\'m going to adopt that rule next time I run a campaign that will
benefit from it.  It is certainly a reasonable and sensible method of
handling the problem.

I\'ll set them up, somebody else can knock them down.

1)  Newsgroup: NO, please a thousand times NO!!!!!!!!

Sorry to shout, but...I frequently read about a dozen newsgroups, and
between the spammers, the RPG\'s are satanic thread, the appeals to fight the
Telecom Act, etc...the signal to noise ratio is ridiculously high...

I may not agree with everything everybody says here (thank goodness I
don\'t), but at least the comments are usually (99% of the time) on
topic.

2) Mailing Lists...

2 Newsgroups: 1) TNE
(I know this is going to make somebody mad at me, so I\'ll dawn the
asbestos underwear), Because like it or not, most CT/MT players
can\'t stand virus or the changes done by TNE to the mililieu as well
as the rules system.  Personally, I have no problems with Virus, but
I can\'t stand Dave Nilsen as a writer.  Most of the later TNE
sourcebooks looked a little too much like Dave Nilsen\'s personal ego
trips.  Heck, there\'re are a lot of CT people who thought
the Rebellion was a bad idea...

2) CT/MT/T4

Since T4 is going to have a rules system which is drawing heavily
from CT & MT, with the addition of a lot of good ideas from other
materials put out, the rules systems will at least be similar enough,
to have intelligible Technogeek discussions, even if the Eras will be
widely disparate.

I think TNE is just a different animal.  In some ways, it is
ironically enough, the most complete set of Traveller rules ever put
out, but they\'re just so radically different from what came before,
and what is apparently going to come after, that the 2 are just a
little too incompatible to coexist.  I subscribe to both mailing
lists, and will probably continue to subscribe to whatever number of
mailing lists come out of the smoke after August.

If there\'s one thing I dislike about xboat/traveller, it\'s when people 
post to both lists. Ah, but I digress...

Perhaps we should have a third list: tne

xboat would remain for CT/MT
tne would cover, you got it, tne
traveller would cover the most recent version of trav, plus any 
miscellanous (sp?) traffic, like flame wars on asteroid throwing
and such.

This would give a separate list for each set of rules/background.

Also, specifying that all common stuff would go to traveller would
save me from reading the same messages twice...

Well time to unlurk ... all the nostalgia got to me.

I started roleplaying about 1978 shortly after I got out of the Marines
amnd went back to college.  I had been a fairl consistant war gamer for 
about 3 years.  

When I went back to school I had heard of D&D but not seen it.  It that there
was a guy who ownbed a book store in Cookevile TN (Tennessee Tech) who had
copies of the D&D 3x5 sized books.  Several of us got to gather and plyed D&D
with grafted in Fantasy Trip riles for about a year.

The we found Traveller.  We stiull played D&D (we had a Dm who was incredible
-- now a histroy professor wonderfully detailed worlds)  but even in D&D 
we spent more time exploring and trading than hacking & Slashing.
Not that comabt was uncommon it just wasn\'t the focus.

We played a single campaign in Traveller for about 3 years - about 7 of 
us, including my wife.  We could never wait for th enew books to come out.

That campaign ended with the Imperium nationaizing our newly built custom
400 ton trading ship with the out brak of the 5th Frontier war (as it occured
in JTAS).

Those were great days.  Since then I play little -- collect alot.  I 
guess I own about 40-50 systems.  Still Think Travellar is one of th 
ebest - in any incarnation.

I am about to introduce my 13 year old and one of his friends to a very 
Modified TNE mostly because of the smaller focus and am eager for the new 
set.

I am also interested in trying a 2300 AD style campaign using real :^) 
traveller rules.

Later.

My money says that it won\'t be compatible with T4 anymore than it would be,
say, with Star Frontiers or any other completely unrelated game.  I have to
admit, I haven\'t actually worked with it, but everything I\'ve seen indicates
that any attempt to replicate CT and MT vehicles, equipment, or ships has
been a poor fit, and it looks like the New Traveller will be very much like
the old systems.

I wholeheartedly agree.

The main reason I was happy to see the original list split was because
of all the FF&S stuff plus all the TNE rules discussions. I think NT should
go into the XBOAT list since it will clearly be a derivative of CT/MT. I
expect that TNE will eventually dry up but it could still carry alot of
bandwidth due to the nature of the design rules.

We tend to treat it as Military Equipment (restricted at Lawlevel 3, I think).

Frankly, this is what you\'ll end up with anyway.  Neither the populations 
of Xboat or TNE will be able to stop themselves from speculating, 
which they will do in a vaccuum.

I vote for option 5 (one list), but I could not bear the resulting canon/
mechanics fights for the "one true way".  And certainly, at this point, 
there is no reason to split off another list for T4 (another vote; I document 
Windows NT for a living; if you must, then 4T).  There is not enough grist 
for the mill.

        I feel that is will be reworked, revised, and /or replaced with

the items are directly able to be pulled into MT as either replacements or
fixes, or in a few cases, additions, to existing MT rules: Computers,
Hulls, Even drives... things where performance in the game is measured by
real-world stats can be adapted quite easily: Just use MT\'s damage capacity
stats, and remember the difference in displacement tons! (Converting fixed
size/even DT items multiply volume by 27/28).

MTJ4:
        I just converted a ship I did in FF&S to MT; it does everything
better now. But I discovered a problem in MTJ4: the ship design options has
a medbay: it masses 201 according to the table, with a displacement of 35.
How would y\'all fix it?

List Split:
        Unlike Phil & Phil, I tend to think that T4 will not be close
enough to CT/MT for flame-free discussions (Hell, CT/MT barely are!). I
think it will be compatable, but not so much so that tech gurus would be
comfortable with some of those on this list who love to go off on
gearheads.

MT vs CT: I get the feeling that MT has no home even here... no offense,
but I feel like everything I\'ve seen here is aimed at CT, and have gotten
the feeling that MT is the "uninvited little brother" if you follow my
analogy.

	I not only hope they go back to Snapshop/Striker, I hope the new 
system includes all the old CT rules (with appropriate 
updates/modifications) -

Combat:  Basic, Striker, Snapshot, Mercenary
Space Combat:  Basic, High Guard
World Creation:  Basic, Scouts, Grand Survey/Census
Ship Creation:  Basic, High Guard
etc.

	In other words, I hope they don\'t just stick us with one system 
for each - either complex or simple.  I hope we have a choice.
	That is one of the things I like most about Classic Traveller: 
you can mix and match the systems as appropriate.  For quick and dirty 
space combat, I run using a modified (even more simplified) version of 
the basic rules; for more detailed combat, I pull out High Guard.  I 
might make a sector using the basic rules, then further generate a few 
worlds using the Scouts rules, ending up with one or two fully fleshed 
out with the Grand Survey/Grand Census rules.  It\'s my choice which 
system of the many available that I actually use in a given circumstance.
	I hope not to loose that with the new Traveller.

    'body' => 'I *finally* managed to pick up a copy of Alien Module 4: Zhodani.  It is
quite good, but did not answer one question I have about the Zhodani.  I\'m
wondering if anyone else noticed this problem, and what other possible
solutions are. 

Social status is hereditary among the Zhodani.  Individuals who\'s parents
were members of the nobility are nobles, even if their Psionic Strength is
quite low.  Every Prole with a Psionic Strength of 9+ is raised to
Indendant status, and 3/7s of Indendants are raised to Noble status,
either through competition in the Psionic Games, or as a reward for
service. 

This implies one of three possibilities:

1) Every generation a great percentage of the population joins the ranks 
of the nobility.  In 20 or 30 generations, nobles would likely outnumber 
everyone else, so this is unlikely to be true.


2) Proles are encouraged to have many children, while Nobles and
Intendants are encouraged to have small families.  This solves the problem
of Nobles outnumbering everyone else, but does mean that the Zhodani
population would be growing at an enormous rate, and would be continually
and violently expansionistic in its search for more inhabitable worlds. 
Given the slow and conservative description of the Zhodani Consolate,
this does not seem to be the case. 

3) Some method must exist to remove individuals for the ranks of the Noble
and the Intendant classes.  This seems to be the most likely answer. 

OK, what could such a method be?  Well, taking a lesson from western
history, perhaps only one child of a Noble family (perhaps the first born)
can become a Noble, the rest either become Proles or Intendants, depending
on their Psionic Strength. 

To keep the ranks of the Intendants down, any child of an Intendant who
has a Psionic Strength lower than 9 is automatically a Prole. 

Comments?  Other ideas, things I\'ve missed?

OK, my turn I suppose!

I first encountered Traveller (after a bad start when my then girlfriend, a
sometime D&Der like myself, had described a witnessed session as "a lot of
people shouting at each other") with a small group most of whom I knew through
college. The setting was a bit unusual; it comprised a race, called and styled
after the Gumball Rally, across an unnamed planet in groundcars. The difference
from certain "cute" films was that _anything_ went.

We hung out of car windows and shot at each other. We battled with hordes of
bikers a la Damnation Alley. We lost it, badly, and shot up 45o embankments to
crash into housing estates beyond. We killed nosey coppers and wedged them on
pinless hand grenades for their colleauges to find. We shot people merely for
wearing Bermuda shorts. We drove anything that\'d go, including milkfloats. There
wasn\'t a shred of plot, roleplaying, morals or background. Characters died like
Paranoiacs; I\'d take four each evening. We loved it!

Later, when the fuss had died down, we started to read some background stuff,
and then began to play Traveller for real. With hindsight, what we\'d actually
been doing was inventing Car Wars several years early, but it whetted our
appetites. Now, we have Imperium-spanning adventures, deeply developed
characters, background and environment detail you could live in.

But every so often, up goes the cry of "Gumball!" and we dig out the car rules
(recently upgraded to MegaTrav and including tasks up to Loony (23+), Forget It
(27+) and Aaarrghh! (31+) for keeping on the road at up to 300mph.

Assuming (without looking at my MTJ4) that the mass is in tons and the
displacement in cubic meters, I\'d guess that 201 is a typo for "20".  I
would figure that a med bay would be somewhat less dense than water, by the
time you leave space to move around....

I also wish for the ease of striker/AHL, and also for a broad base of
goodies to be added to vehicles and starships. Striker has a number of
interesting goodies, as does FF&S; MT\'s designs are essentially compatible
with striker, but end up being a stripped down system with few frills. The
biggest difference between striker and MT is the separation of the damage
stat from penetration, and the use of the DGP task system. The intterupt
system is great, but can be safely ignored.

that, law level 4?).  So any law level at or above that point 
*possession* (outside the home only at lower levels) of armor is illegal.

3). Local Law - Low law level planet

Here comes the role-playing aspect.  Ok, it is allowable by law
 to own and wear powered armor around town, to the grocery store, while 
renewing your driver\'s lisence, etc.  That\'s fine.  The same place would 
presumably allow one to carry around a loaded shotgun or a long bladed 
knife openly, or an FGMP.

The thing is, just because it is allowed under law doesn\'t mean it is 
allowed under society.  We just don\'t go around in Bostn, for example, 
with a sidearm, although (permitted) possession of firearms is quite 
legal.  If I were to come to work \'old west style\' I would be stopped and 
taken downtown for questioning, permit or no permit.

So your characters come striding into town in two-ton powered armor, 
punching through the floorboards of the local Registry of Motor Vehicles 
and boom out over the voice amplification system "I\'D LIKE TO RENEW MY 
DRIVER\'S LISENCE PLEASE".  When he or she steps back out into the street, 
the local constabulary (also armored at this point) wants to have a word 
with him.

Conclusion; Armor is NOT Subtle.  Unless there is a good reason (nasty 
predators, guerilla snipers commonly around, etc.) one will not be able 
to accomplish anything while wearing BD.  "Frontier towns" may 
occasionally make an exception to this, but in general it is considered 
military hardware, adn there is no excuse for civilians to have it.

Right now, I\'m running a campaign where the largest weapon we\'ve seen is 
a .44 magnum autopistol.  There has been plenty of carnage to satisfy the 
bloodthirsty, but it makes for a much more subtle campaign when no one 
possesses anything approaching overwhelming firepower.

Besides, think how excited and surprised they\'ll be when they first 
encounter the wrong end of a light machine gun!

	This, however, I would buy. That\'s a cool idea. 
	But, make the hex map sheet\'s second side contain the painting 
guide, and put the 1-page-only starship combat rules on another sheet - 
this would be more useful, IMO.

intentions on letting this list die.  I was not handed the reigns by the creator
to just close its doors.  This list has a long successful history and I think
it has a long successful future.

Here are my reasons for not supporting the news group idea:

Netnews is out of control.  A full news feed cannot be transmitted over a T1
without falling behind.  Netnews\' days are numbered.  Between the web, and
the total amount of worthless spam in the news groups, administrators are
less likely to want to carry netnews.  We receive a restricted feed of just
alt.,comp.,rec., and sci. (less alt.binaries).  Even then, as much as I have 
been a big news advocate for the past 12 years, find myself asking why?

So as diskspace becomes more precious, and so does bandwidth, admins will look
for things to eliminate.  News is at the top of the heap.  If sites stop
having netnews, then our group dies with it.  Mailing lists are more popular
than ever right now because they are not open to spam, they are low bandwidth
and they are effective.

I would like to ask a favor of the subscribers.  Please drop this thread and
return to discussing Traveller.  I have no intention of making any changes
in the lists or creating a new list until the new game takes shape and we have
a clearer picture about its make up.  Any discussion about what to do is very
pre-mature at this point.  Lets wait a few months.  If we let this kind of
thread die, and go back to discussing the game, and traffic looks like it 
warrents it, I will create a special, short term list for discussing the future
(i.e. news.groups) where we can rationally discuss the various options.  I 
like to think of this list as your list, since you are the people that makes
the list, so your opinion is very very important.  But my job as administrator
is to keep things in focus and maintain the lists.  At this point, there is
no need to change things, and there may never be.  Let it die, and we will
fix it when it breaks.

Thanks for your understanding

no idea we were so numerous!).  So this is a final plea for votes before 
I head off for sunny Florida for a week.  Here (for the final time, I 
promise!) are the instructions for voting and the voting options.


VOTING INSTRUCTIONS:

Read the following list of options about the future of TML/XTML mailing
lists, and send me email indicating your preference. My address is:

charles@hebb.psych.mcgill.ca

IMPORTANT:  The message subject line should be "Survey: Option x", where x
is the number of your preferred option.  If you have already sent me a
vote that was not in this format, please send in another and make it clear
in the body of the letter that this is a second vote so I don\'t count you
twice.  Thanks. Additional comments are welcome, but please make the
subject line as indicated.


VOTING OPTIONS:

1. Leave Traveller and Xboat alone, create new mailing list for New
Traveller.  This would mean three lists, one for CT/MT, one for TNE, and
another for NT.

2. Leave lists as are, but discuss New Traveller on Xboat.  This would
mean two lists, one for CT/MT/NT and another for TNE.

3. Leave lists as are, but discuss New Traveller on Traveller.  This
would mean two lists, one for CT/MT, and one for TNE/NT.

4. Leave lists as are, and discuss New Traveller on either/both.  This
would mean two lists, one for CT/MT/NT, and another for TNE/NT.

5. Create single list for all game versions (CT/MT/TNE/NT).

6. Create several lists divided by topic, such as technology, history,
rules, etc.

7. Create new list for TNE, discuss New Traveller on Traveller, and leave
Xboat for CT/MT.  This is similar to option 1, except that the TML
retains its charter as a forum for discussing the latest Traveller version.

8. Other (please specify).


Just a reminder: I\'m "closing the poll" April 30th, so get those votes in
soon.

Happy Travellin\',
Charles.

in genre, and tried to manage the issue myself in several campaigns. From
what I\'ve seen, the best approach is to look at the background of whatever
world - whether a universe or a single planet or city - and work from
there.

As for high Law worlds, it seems to me that the authorities are concerned
with being able to enforce the laws, and would likely have regulations if
not rules against people walking about in defensive gear that the
authorities cannot overcome. Police forces armed with simple gauss pistols
would not want to let someone roam their precinct in Combat Armor or
Battledress - but then, it\'s also unlikely that any actions by any part in
that precinct will require such.

I use this line of reasoning against players who try to argue "it\'s only
defense - it doesn\'t hurt anyone". The Law needs to be able to take you
down, and they don\'t want to have to call out the National Guard or a SWAT
team to do it.

Of course, on such worlds there will likely be other methods of penalizing
impregnable characters. One would be strict regulation of their vessel -
impounding it if needed. They may also have mechanical or electronic
devices, or even software (Virus!) that allows them to render your armor
useless (espedcially Battledress). On a smaller level, extremely high Law
level planets may require the implanting of tracers, chemical modifiers, or
other means of quelling an individual. If you act bad, they don\'t shoot
you, they just activate the Prozac-sac implanted in you by the Port
Authority :)

Of course, in the case of guerilla operations, anything goes, but in that
case, I would fall back on the words of Jason Carter, an excellent player
and GM from my days in Tacoma: What\'s good for the PCs is good for the NPCs

I rarely buy clothing that advertises what I buy... but in this case, I
could make an exception.  Either one would be cool, or perhaps different

I like the idea of having them all together in one place, but there\'s one
problem.  I didn\'t appreciate it until they came out with TNE miniatures,
but _Traveller_ starships are, on the whole, the *dullest* things in known
space!  They\'re just little wedges and balls and tubes!

>I\'m wondering if anyone else noticed this problem...

  The problem he refers to is that, as presented in the old Alien Module,
Zhodani society becomes top-heavy very quickly.  The underlying
reason for this is that there is "no way down".  No provisions are given
for a decrease in social standing, leading to a society that is
overwhelmingly made up of nobles in just a dozen generations.
  When I brought this up with Loren Wiseman three years ago (on GEnie), he
reminded me of one large factor: the roll to determine PSI is an artifact of
_Player Character_ generation.  The whole population does not just roll 2d6
for Psionic Talent.  Only a small percentage is psionic at all.  This slows
the social climber problem in Zhodani society quite a bit, even if you
assume that the Zhodani have a higher percentage of psionic latents than
Imperial Humaniti tends to (an arguable assumption).  This doesn\'t _solve_
the problem, however.

 For my purposes, I decided that Intendants and Nobles may only pass their
titles on to _one_ child.  The rest fall to the next rung down.  Thus most
of a Noble\'s kids are Intendants, and most of an Intendant\'s kids are Proles.
This is just the beginning, since every child is tested for psionic potential,
and may well rise on their own talents.
 As an additional wrinkle, only the two lowest ranks of nobility are passed
along at all!  These correspond to Social Standing rolls of 11 and 12.
These presumably are local and/or planetary levels.  You cannot be born to
serve in the Consulate High Council!
 The first change explains, for instance, how it is possible to be born
an Intendant (with an initial SOC roll of 10). The second change is
reflected in the social structure of the Zhodani already: You must be
elected to serve at any level above the city/community level, and that
election is (usually) held by your peers at each level. Truly high office
is _always_ based on individual effort and talent.

 So what do the two levels of hereditary nobility mean?  I could accept
that the upper level is awarded to a family for high service by an
ancestor.  Families with ancestors who served on the High Council would
tend to be at this level, as would the descendants of great heroes. It
could also serve as another rung on the inheritance ladder, producing the
following:

 SOC 12 - one child is SOC 12, the rest are SOC 11
 SOC 11 - one child is SOC 11, the rest are SOC 10 (Intendants)
 SOC 10 - one child is an Intendant, the rest are Proles
 SOC 9 or less - all children are Proles.

 On the upward side, as described in the Alien Module, we get:

 All children are tested for psionic potential
 Prole children who test at PSI 9+ are made Intendants.
 Intendants can become nobles (SOC 11) via the Psionic Games or as a reward
   for service.
 Nobles are fully participating members of the Consulate government, and
   may advance through the various levels of Council by the votes of their
   peers.

 And my own addition:

 Nobles who give exemplary service to the Consulate have their hereditary
   rank raised to SOC 12.

 Hope this helps,

So far we have: 

1) tranq rounds for snub pistols and gauss weapons
2) gas rounds for snub pistols and shotguns 
3) Neural weapons at TL 16
4) Tasers written up in Challenge # 40

This seems rather scanty compared to the vast legions of deadly hardware
which abounds in the Imperium.  Has anyone else added to this?  I would
think that there would be a significant number of options, especially in
the TL 12-15 range. 

I\'m not sure of stats for these, but one which come to mind are:

1) Sonic stunners, TL 12?
2) Electro-lasers (ie wireless, dart-less tasers), TL 13?
3) Tangle grenades/shotgun shells (quick hardening glob which entangles a 
   single target), TL 10?
4) Lower the tech level of neural weapons to TL 15 (they are (generally)
   non-lethal, and much less deadly than even a gauss pistol).

The sonic stunners may be a bit outside the Imperium paradigm, but the
electro-lasers and tangle grenades sound like they should work. 

Comments?  Other ideas?

	Perhaps that shows the wargame roots of Traveller as well as any 
other aspect of the system.  
	In all the systems I\'ve GM\'d, only very rarely have nonlethal 
weapons been a popular item.  The needle guns with tranquilizer needles 
were popular in one game, I recall (Shadowrun?).  In Star Frontiers, the 
stun gun was popular.  In Champions, the superheros rarely used lethal 
methos (in fact, most characters didn\'t even HAVE lethal powers).  But I 
don\'t recall any other games in which the characters chose nonlethal 
methods when others were available.
	So much for my theories of why things are the way they are in 
Traveller. 
	As far as adding more non-lethal weapons, why not?  Would it 
affect game balance?  It would depend on what sort of defenses were 
available, and how easily obtainable the items were.  If there aren\'t 
many defenses to them, then they should be as difficult to obtain as 
PGMP-15\'s.  But if we assume the normal defenses available to adventurers 
will be as effective with non-lethal weaponry, then perhaps they could be 
commonly available items.  After all, in 20th century America it isn\'t 
difficult to get stun guns, mace, pepper spray, etc.
	It wouldn\'t be a bad thing to add them to the new Traveller...but 
I don\'t know whether many characters would use these items if available.

I think the CT double adventure Divine Intervention has sonic stunners
as PC special equipment.  I\'m suprised these didn\'t make it into MT,
as almost every other piece of postulated equipment has.

Weapons of Non-Leathal Intent (WNLI) are the big topic of discussion in several 
UN subcommittees right now.  The US DOD, Russia and the British MOD have done a 
lot of interesting research into it, and come up with some very Buck-Rodgers 
ideas, including Focussed-Concussion Explosives, Tasers, incapacitiating riot 
control gasses, stcky foam, dowel guns and sonic projectors.  However, each one 
of these weapons has been a miserable failure from a purely economic view; the 
cost of the weapons and manpower to incapacitiate one person with WNLI is at 
least ten times greater than with standard weapons.  In addition, each of the 
methods come up with thus far have very limited applications; they can either 
be easily blocked/avoided, or easily defended against.  The WNLI that are more 
effective at avoiding these defenses tend to be much more drastic and more 
potentially leathal.

I would suspect that Traveller has less WNLI due to the wargame background, but 
also because a WNLI that effects a human would effect aliens very differently; 
aliens might be unaffected by a concussion wave, or might die when exposed to a 
gas that incapacitates humans.  It would seem very unlikely that there would be 
one thing  (beyond plain old kinetic energy) that would effect all races 
equally, from either a WNLI or Leathal Weapon viewpoint.

Some interesting things to look for:
1)  Sonics.  There seems to be a lot of potential here.  Police and Military 
have had major success with a very simple Sonic WNLI, the Flash-Bang Concussion 
grenade.  There are some new experimental flash-bang rifle rounds soon to be 
produced, and the actual grenade continues to be improved (but remains quite 
dangerous to bystanders).  In the future, you might see major improvements in 
some of the experiemental crowd-control sound projectors used in China and 
Russia; imagine a hand-held weapon that immediately stuns an opponent, or fills 
the opponent with dread and terror.  In Traveller, I have always included 
sonics as part of the anti-hijacking routines on a ship.  The PA system can 
project sound waves to stun or calm others, and the floors can be set to v
ibrate harmonically with similar effects.
2) Light.  The Flash-Bang Grenades work as much from the shock of the bright 
flare as from the sound.  Scientists have found several different effects that 
strobing light has on human brains, and human reactions to bright light can be 
manipulated to a stun or similar incapacitiation effect.  Tom Clancy used a 
really spiffy sort of light projector in his last book as a WNLI weapon weilded 
by some CIA agents in Japan.

Nonleathal Arms Co. Gooey Gun+
This classic crowd control and perp apprehension tool fires a capsule full of 
polymer strands coated with a tacky, sticky adhesive which expand as the 
travel to the target - up to 30 meters away!  Be sure to order the "Goo Melt-
away"  aerosol or you won\'t be able to reclaim your catch for hours!

Gooey Gun	Min Range; 5m	Max. Range 30m	Short Range 5m	
	Covers 5 sq. m area (about 1 person)
Weapon is single shot, air pressure propelled, 90cm long, wt. 1.5Kg, Cr. 1600

[Stats not worked out, simply an automatic drum fed version of the above, 
complete with air-compressor.]

Electric Stunner+
Renders a suspect unconscious or disoriented for a brief period at close 
range.  Also leaves your perp with a nasty headache.  This version of stunner 
uses an electric charge - not sonics - to do the job.  This renders normal 
stunner countermeasures useless.

warning; can cause serious injury or death in certain susceptible people.
usage warning; do not fire while touching target.

Stun Pistol	Max Range; 5m	Short Range; 2m
	Effects all touching one target

Non-lethal Hand Grenades
The only solution for riot control, personal protection from gang violence, 
or protecting your personal property.  All grenades are guaranteed to operate 
as specified and inspected by our quality control specialists.  They have the 
following common characteristics;
Wt. 0.5Kg	size; 30cm l. by 10 cm dia	Color coded.	Adjustable 
Timer (1 to 60 sec.)
Sold and priced in boxes of 12 only.  Usual persistence is about 2 minutes.

"Smoke and Light Show": makes a big bang, a blinding flash, and generates 
copious smoke to cover a 5m diameter circle.  Color coded white.	
						Cr. 240 / box

Smoke Only:  as above but leave out the bang and flash.  Colored Gray	
						Cr.200 / box

Concussion: momentarily stuns anyone in a medium sized (12 sq. meters) 
enclosed space who is not properly prepared (Please follow instructions 
carefully).  Colored blue	
						Cr. 480 / box
                                                
[proper preparation is to open your mouth and cover your ears; work on
a sudden overpressure principal]

Tear Gas   fills an area [circle] up to 5 m in diameter with an acrid vapor 
which causes burning eyes and severe disorientation to the unprotected. 
Colored yellow				
						Cr. 480 / box

Knockout Gas ; inhalant will render most people unconscious within 4 m of the 
source.  We recommend double coverage for certain results.  Releases a heavy 
duty inhalant sedative which will render the perp(s) unconscious for about 20 
minutes.		
	   					Cr. 620 / box

Knockout Gas ; transdermal effects as per the inhalant version, but nothing 
short of an environment suit will prevent the effects.	
						Cr. 1250 / box

Restraint Equipment

Constriction Bands:  Will respond only to grip of the person they are keyed 
to (or an emergency release device, provided).  Forget about thin wristed or 
double jointed perps, these conform to the suspects entire hands from the 
wrist up.				
						Cr. 500 / pair

Shock Collars:  An unremoveable collar paired with a special remote control 
which administers a shock whenever the bearer presses a button.  The shock is 
of an intensity sufficient to distract the perp from thinking of escape or 
disobedience without the possibility of serious injury.  Available in special 
sizes for Vargr and Aslan perps.	
		 			Cr. 1000 / collar
					Cr. 500 / contrlr

Gravitic Perp Transfer Case:  Having problems moving Perps around?  This 
coffin-shaped chamber will restrain a perp perfectly and its anti-grav units 
precisely counteract gravity to make transport by hand easily accomplished.  
external controls allow the administration of sedatives or other drugs 
without opening the case.  Liquid internal cushioning can compensate for up 
to 4 gravities of acceleration without injury.  Internal life support and 
waste elimination will last up to 8 hours.  The laminate composite shell 
is [mostly] impervious to small arms fire, and certainly up to whatever the 
guy inside can do.	
					Cr. 24,000

	I\'ve heard reports about the poor effectiveness of WNLI as well 
(particularly the sticky foam).

	This is an interesting possibility.  I would think that, in the 
future, they could do quite a bit with this.  Perhaps someone can come up 
with some specific weapons based on sonic technology, including specific 
game effects.

	It\'s interesting that both of these (light and sound) have a 
long, long history of usage in combat/dangerous situations.  The 
high-tech sticky foams and such are failures, while the most promising 
things spring from much older technology (although their current 
implementation may be through very high technology).

	Thank you for the great post!

How\'s\'about saying that the children of "honourary" nobles (ie those with no PSI

the social stigma of being a "handicapped" noble, it\'s probably less likely for
a PSI-less noble to attract a partner and have children.

If you can get a hold of them, there were a number of alien modules
published for "Classic Traveller", one for each alien.  In no particular
order, these were:  Zhodani, Solomani, Aslan, Vargr, K\'Kree, Droyne, Hivers,
and Darrians.  Another rare but valuable resource is back issues of the
Journal of the Travellers\' Aid Society.  The Contact!  section had valuable
information on alien races, often including character generation

Only two alien modules were ever published specifically for MegaTraveller:
Vilani & Vargr and Solomani & Aslan.  All of these are out of print, so
they\'re hard to get and are often expensive when you can.  The Referee\'s
Companion also included longer essays on Zhodani, Droyne, Vargr, and Aslan,
but no rules other than word generation.  Also, the Imperial Encyclopedia
(in the boxed set) includes articles on various alien races.  This isn\'t
much to go on, but it\'s a start.

Supposedly, an alien sourcebook will be a high priority for the latest
version of Traveller, coming out this August.  Until then, here are some
quick and dirty rules for generating Vargr and Aslan.  These are the major
aliens closest to humaniti and also the most likely to be found in the Imperium.

Vargr--Are weaker than humans and not as tough (-1 on strength and
endurance), but also more lithe and dextrous (+1 dexterity).  They may
enlist in any service, but suffer a -2 penalty to enlist in the Merchants.
In combat, Vargr may use their hands(normal), teeth(normal), or claws (-2).
Brawling skill for Vargr is called Infighting, and allows them to use all
their natural weapons.

Aslan--Are less dextrous than humans (-1 on dexterity), but bigger, tougher,
and stronger (+1 to strength and endurance).  Aslan may enlist in any
service. However, Aslan males receive a DM of -4 for enlistment and
re-enlistment in the Merchants and Scouts.  Both males and females receive
DMs of +1 for enlistment, promotion, and re-enlistment in the marines and in
the army.  In close combat, Aslan generally use their natural weapon--the
dewclaw.  Any receipt of Brawling or Blade Combat automatically becomes
Dewclaw (except for Aslan in the Marines who learn how to use the cutlass as
a matter of tradition).  Teh dewclaw should be treated as a dagger in combat.

NOTE:  These are only the basics, based on the original Contact! Articles
re-published in Best of JTAS 2.  There are other rules which really should
be included (e.g. Vargr charisma, Aslan skill restrictions by sex), but I\'m
way too tired now.

Could anyone post the stats on these stunners?  I\'d be most interested in

I still vividly remember my first expsoure to Traveller combat, we were
trying to foil a terrorist plot.  My character shot an escaping terrorist,
(I was attempting to capture the terrorist).  One shot from a pistol
(Striker rules) and that was it, one dead terrorist :(

Yes, I do. Or rather, I have a house rule about _decreased_ chance for psi
abilities. I\'ve introduced a throw for psionic potential. That\'s something a
character must have in order to even get a psi strength roll. People with 
potential can have an actual psi rating of 0; but people without potential 
_definitely_ has a rating of 0. The chances of having psi potential are:

Player Characters: Automatic.
NPCs: Roll 2D; if you roll 4- the character has psionic potential.
Modifications:
Home culture has persecuted psionics for millenia: -2
Home culture has persecuted psionics for centuries: -1 (The Imperium)
Home culture has encouraged psionics for centuries: +1
Home culture has encouraged psionics for millenia: +2  (The Zhodani)
One parent has psi potential: +4
Both parents have psi potential: +8  

Note that the psionic strength of the parents in no way affects the roll
for psionic strength.

Note: I\'m pretty sure that a rigorous statistical analysis of these
      figures will demonstrate inconsistencies; please don\'t tell me
      about them.

There was an article in White Dwarf, many years ago (below #50, I think) with
some stun weapons; tasers, LPL (low power lasers), a concussion rifle and a
nifty widget called an Anagun which fires needles - including special drilly
needles for penetrating battle dress. We build them into security robots

I would think that sound and light would be quite effective still on their
own, as they both can cause extreme pain in large quantities (eg. looking at

It would be good is you could calibrate it, but as for Aliens, they\'d still
have get specimens to figure out what the calibrations needed to be.

I like this.  The fact that basically *everyone* has psionic strength is
kind of annoying, especially when you consider the low roll needed to get
some abilities (5+ for telepathy).  

I also agree with not having psionics be a hereditary abilitiy, although I
think an extra column is needed for the DMs.  I think that Zhodani should be
able to forgoe the psionic potential and roll normally for psionic strength.
This is just due to the fact that they encourage and have practiced psionics
for so long.

The answer to those questions were given in MTJ#4:

" What are the tech levels of the Major Races? - J.M.
  Strictly speaking, there is no one tech level for each major race, =
just as there is no one tech level for the Shattered Imperium. Each =
major world per system has its own tech level. But the maximum tech =
level you find for worlds in the Imperium is TL15/16, with the emphasis =
on tech 15, although the tech 16 worlds are getting ever more frequent.
  As for the Solomani, tech level 14/15 is the maximum, with tech 15 =
worlds few and far between.
  The Zhodani are also a maximum tech level of 14/15, but tech 15 worlds =
are more common than in Solomani space.
  The Hiver maximum tech level is 15/16 with the tech level 16 worlds =
appearing more frequently all the time. The Hivers are well on their way =
to becoming the technological leaders of charted space.
  The Aslan are a solid maximum of tech 14, with an occasional tech =
level 15 world thrown in here and there.
  The K\'kree are the most conservative technologically, with a macimum =

1) SHouldn\'t it be 4+, not 4- ???
2) Zhodani Proles should take a negative, as they are not selected for psi
potential, as those with Psi of note are rmoved from the pool... I\'d
reccomend a dm-2 for proles, a dm+0 for intendants, and a DM+3 for nobles.

3) I\'d make even PC\'s roll (my current group has nought but psionic
persons... quite a danger).

4) Also, I\'d set it to a n 11+ roll (or maybe a 7+) to correspond to the
MT/T4 task systems difficulties, and if diff was a 7+, use +2/+4 for
one/both parents having had TRAINING prior to your birth, as they could
encourage and nurture certain small traits once they detected them... but
that\'s a personal thing.

SF tradition is part of it, but there\'s a practical justification -- when 
your society is spread out over long distances, time-wise, local 
governments have to have a lot of autonomy.  A feudal system, where the 
local rulers can act as they see fit on most issues, is likely to be one 
of the more effective ways to govern, when orders from the capital take 
months, or years, to arrive.  Democracies require good internal 
communications.

	Because they call it Space Opera..that\'s why.  The reason you see it 
so much in SF is that it\'s an easy cop-out way of having a 
pre-concieved governmental structure that all readers have some idea 
of it\'s structure...this is the same &@#%@$ reason Trav has 
cutlasses...sigh.

	The Rule of Man was called the Ramshackle Empire for good reason 
 Its government derived from the Solomani military takeover of 
Vilani government.  It was a sort of  autocratic sort of feudal sort of 
bureaucracy that, mainly, left things to local administrators to keep 
things running.  Therefore, I suspect the gamut ran from sheer 
anarchy to utter autocracy, and everything in between, depending on 
the resourcefulness and/or ambition of the local commander. 

	This, among other things, was what led to the Long Night; this lack 
of centralized authority, or more precisely, lack of centralized 
SOURCE of authority.  No government with communication lag times 
restricted by Jump 2 travel times can operate with any sort of 
centralized authority...the officials on scene have to pretty much 
run everything themselves. What makes the difference between this 
turning into a lot of independent states and a single empire is 
everyone\'s belief in the Emperor\'s clothes, and the strength and 
loyalty of his navy.

John (and anyone else who is interested), your best bet is you local library.  
Janes Defense Weekly has had several good articles in the past two years.  I\'ve 
gotten most of my limited knowledge from a Newsgroup on GEnie, but that 
newsgroup (like far too much of GEnie) has been basically dead for the past 6 
months.  You might also see if your library carries any of the UN proceedings.  
I don\'t remember the subcommittee name, but it was an offshoot of the Security 
Council\'s Peacekeeping oversight committee.  This whole subject is new enough 
that there are probably not much in the way of books yet, but there may be a 
few collections of essays and articles.

However, from the various ship designs and such which have been published,
I think TL 15 equipment and ships are rather common.  I\'ve always assumed
that it is possible to buy small, easily shipped TL 15 tech at almost any
Class A starport in the Imperium.  Of course, if the Starport is on a TL 9
planet, located in someplace isolated like Reaver\'s Deep, then I would
expect the equipment to be priced as much as 100-150% higher than normal. 

It does seem that the Imperial Navy and Scout service almost 
exclusively use High Stellar ships and equipment.

The *average* TL in the Imperium is around C or D (12-13), but the nominal
maximum is F (15).  Worlds of nonhuman races also vary, but I believe the
highest TL for the Aslan is D(13).  For the K\'Kree and Zhodani, I believe
it\'s E(14), and Hivers have achieved TL G (16) in many fields, especially
computers and robotics.

At the risk of being an utter geek, here\'s Marc Miller\'s justification for
blade weapons from _Best of JTAS_ I:

"For completenesss, Traveller is forced to include a wide variety of weapons
such as swords, knives, spears, and other "prinitive" weapons.  Dealing with
primitive cultures, players could find themselves involved in a fight with a
group armed with such weapons, and the rules must cover the use of edged
weapons, spears, and such.

"Another major consideration is law level.  American technology produced
nukes, artillery, napalm, machineguns, and dozens of other lethal devices,
but the law level makes moost of these unavailable and places obstacles in
the way of the purchase of the rest.  Anyone, however, gcan get a knife or a
tire chain or a louisville slugger.  A significant number of killings every
year are accomplished with weapons that a caveman would have no trouble with.

"As far as the military goes, tradition and esprit de corops can be used to
justify the inclusion of some blade training.  Perhaps arbitrarily, marines
in Traveller receive training in the cutlass as a service skill; it\'s
justified as a morale building effort, like bayonet training in the US Army
(I received bayonet training, hell, I _gave_ bayonet training, and th army
hasn\'t uised bayonets in any real action since 1918).  Officers in armies
all over the world were taught fencing long after it ceased to have any
military significance.  Over and above all this, some training is still
given in the use of the knife because it is one of the more efficient ways
to kill silently, always of use to commandos and the like.

"Finally, both players and referees sohould keep in mind that old fashioned
weapons are not really designed with the idea that characters will depend on
them for their lives.  Guns, even without skill, are more efficient in most
situations and can be used to great effect.  Blade skill is a background
skill, and should be put to good use only where it is needed."

Thanks. My reason for introducing this was that I found it difficult to
accept that it had been possible to whip up antipathy against a psionic
minority when there was no psionic minority. I mean, if more than half
the population is able to get some sort of useful psi ability, where\'s
the minority?

Psionic potential is a hereditary characteristic. With +8 for both parents
having psi potential, an individual in an ordinary (neither pro- nor anti-
psionic) will automatically have potential himself. 


William F. Hostman:
> 1) SHouldn\'t it be 4+, not 4- ???

No, you roll 2D if you roll a 2, 3 or 4, you have psi potential. If your
culture has favoured psi for millenia you have potential on 6- and so
forth.

Yes, very true. I hadn\'t considered that, not having had to use this roll
for any Zhodani in my campaign.

It\'s your PCs. If you don\'t want them to have psi powers, who\'s to say you

Well, I don\'t feel it necessary to fit everything into one mold. The
Traveller task rules are a great idea, but the implementation leaves much
to be desired.I think the graduation is much too big. Jumps of 4 with 2 D6
are far too much. I\'ve experimented both with using 3 dice and jumps of 2,
neither of which were quite ideal, but both of which worked better than
the official rules (Nowadays I mostly use my own rule system and just use 
the Traveller background).

Yes, but what about at the subsector or planetery level.  Surely the

  I just acquired a copy of the May 1996 Computer Shopper (Metro NY
  Edition) and saw an article in the Tech Section about holographic
  data storage (Title: Light Waves Ahead; p562).

  The article says that Stanford University\'s Center for Nonlinear
  Optical Materials has "a 100 percent working holographic storage
  prototype."  The article then claims that the technology is
  viable enough to be on the market within five years.

  In June 1994, when the first tests of the technology were run,
  the Stanford system successfully encoded, stored, and retrieved a
  JPEG image of the Mona Lisa (originally stored on a conventional
  hard disk), and passed the tests with flying colors.  It is
  claimed that technological improvements have been made, and that
  this year, an MPEG sequence successfully passed the tests.

  The 2cm x 2cm x 1cm holocrystal is made out of Lithium Niobate,
  and the read-write mechanism is based on a blue-green Argon
  laser.  Work is in progress to try to achieve a system which will
  operate using a common red semiconductor laser - much cheaper and
  more available.

  The article then goes into the technical details of how the
  system works - a fascinating read, but too long and complex to
  summarize here - go get a copy of Computer Shopper and read it
  yourself.  Near the end, the claim is made that a consumer
  product (remember, we\'re talking less than five years) will
  exhibit a transfer rate of 1Gbps - yes, that\'s one gigabit per
  second - not too shabby!

  FWIW, the Megatraveller Referee\'s Companion puts holocrystal
  storage at TL13.

A Note on Magazines:  While additional issues of many listed magazines 
(i.e., Travellers\' Digest, JTAS (as Challenge), etc.) were produced, 
they are not included here because those issues contained material related
to games other than Classic Traveller, even though they did contain some 
material usable in the Classic Traveller system.  This is also the reason 
certain issues of Space Gamer, Dragon Magazine, and others are not listed.

means of governing over large distances. Feudalism evolved with a feudal economy
- most people were serfs, bought and sold with the property they lived on. 

Feudal systems collapse when they try to administer an economy that is even a 
little more advanced than subsistence agriculture, because the middle class 
gains wealth and power from middle class activities, while property owners 
(aristocracy) become relatively less wealthy and influential. In order to keep 
their lifestyle and power, the aristocracy have to borrow, marry, or steal 
middle class cash. Eventually the middle class (or military) get sick of upper 
class parasites and demand \'democratic\' rule - that is, democracy so long as the
unwashed masses stay under control. 

Modern industrial democracy predates modern instantaneous communications. In an 
advanced republican system (the USA, for example) there is no NEED for lower 
levels of government to continually suck up to the federal government - that has
only started happening since the 1930s increase in federal power. The USA 
functioned quite well (indeed, some would say even better) when it took a few 
days or weeks for directions from Washington to arrive at the local/State 
government level. Washington didn\'t bother sending out instructions unless it 
was important, which was the way the state governors liked it. 

The only place in the modern world where feudalism has survived beyond a 
subsistence economy is in the Middle East, where the aristocracy managed to get 
their hands on the sole source of wealth - oil. When that oil runs out (or 
competing energy sources make oil worthless), the aristocracy are in the same 
leaky boat. 

Modern republican democracies have proven the most stable means of governing 
modern industrial economies. If the Third Imperium is really a feudal system 
ruling an advanced technological society, there must be a better reason for it 
than \'efficiency of government\'. I guess I\'m looking for a conspiracy theory 
here - can you help me out, Phil? 

And why are dukes and emperors plying the spaceways? \'Space Opera\' is the reason
- pseudo-historical romance is an easy way to get a setting for a story and the 
best way to sell books. Just ask that infinite horde of bloody terrible fantasy 
writers.

I always had a vague idea that marines were trained in blades as ideal
weapons for close-in shipboard combat which (unlike most projectile, laser,
etc. weapons) would not unduly damage any of the ship\'s fragile components.
Certainly if my players start firing large guns on board a ship, they soon
find that some of the systems aren\'t working as well as before, if at all,
due to the large number of bullets which have cut through walls and damaged
wiring, pipes, etc.

Plus, I would consider the term "cutlass" not to be the long curved sword of
Errol Flynn sea-faring films, but a vague historical reflection of the
blade\'s history; the actual weapon used by the marines would be more like an
over-sized commando dagger, honed for cutting or stabbing through vacc\'
suits, etc.

competetive marksman back in high school, when my learning curve was
higher. The same with computers now... the increase of result chances for a
given increase in skill gets much bigger for simple stuff, and much less
for harder stuff, with moderate stuff having the biggest gains, until a
certain point is hit, where the returns drop off.

[rant mode on]
My problem with the MT Task system is the LOW value of attributes in
relation to skill [5:1] and the relatively narrow non-crit-___  margin
[+2<->(-2)]; I would much prefer CS being 3 over and CF being 3 under, with
attributes being used at att/4 [4:1].

This also seems to be the critical break-point for attribute levels for
certain titles, like surgeon. (Many careers use it also, both basic and
advanced).


TNE, however, uses a 1:1 skill level/attribute level, and a given level of
skill or attribute is a simple (+20/+10/+5/+2.5/+1.25) at the five levels
of difficulty, and allows a character who meets the minimums of 1 level of
skill + 3 levels of attribute to have a 5% chance of success at the
Impossible task, something which only an expert (level 4+ minimum, with a
15 in the relavant attribute for a base +3 from attribute; total +7) could
do at all, and a maximum chance at it of 1/12 (less than 9%) assuming
hiting the DM limit of +8. Assuming Specialist Level 8, and a 10 in the
controlling attribute, that\'s a 4- on a d20, or 10%. FOr an Att14, skill 10
(the common max skill level allowed by all TNE GM\'s I\'ve talked TNE with in
alaska), that goes to a 6-, or 30% on an IMPOSSIBLE task; which the
coversions assure me will either be skill 5 -7 equivalent, and +3 (for a
15, because TNE atts are 1 point lower) from attribute, hitting the +8 DM
Limit, and maxing out at 8.something%!

Keep that in mind when trying to come up with a "universal descriptor
system"; after all, TNE uses the same difficulties (with one name change),
and most of the published tasks (except for combat tasks) had unchanged
difficulty levels in the conversion.

No, they haven\'t been disproven, which is different.  The so called
"Communist" governments functioned for decades, and until they fell,
there was no "proof" that they didn\'t work.  When they did collapse,
the apparent corruption and disregard for the people in the system was
as much to blame as the (mis)appropriated tennants.  Before all you
right wingers flame me, I\'d agree that Marx was wrong on many counts,
for example I believe he predicted that the more liberal governments
of western Europe would fall to people\'s revolutions before the more
oppresive ones in eastern Europe.  I\'m just pointing out that there is
no evidence that Modern republican (I live in a non-republican Kingdom
BTW) [capitalist] democracies are the most stable forms of government.
Most nations in history have been governed in other ways.  I believe
that the two oldest democratic republics (France & USA?) have only
been around for 250 years or so (I may well be wrong there, history
not being my strong point).

Sorry to rant so, but when the eastern European governments fell, I
had to listen to my country\'s idiot Prime Minister claim the "death of
socialism" and the "triumph of capitalism" on the eve of a series of
crises which could easily have lead to WW III (and still could)!

Well, yes, but what about Isaac Asimov and Poul Anderson, to name but
two.

A monarchical empire is only one of the possible forms of large scale
interstellar government postulated in Traveller.  The Zhodani have the
democratic consuls, the Solomani have the representation of
nation-states, the First Imperium was run by coalitions of powerful
oligarchs, the Second Imperium by essentially a military junta.  The
Third Imperium claims its form of government is superior, and colours
history to suggest a) its predecessors were more like it than they
truely were and b) their Human competitors are either less successful
(the Solomani) or use distasteful methods (the Zhodani).  Of course,
successful alternate alien forms of government don\'t count, because
they are aliens!

Another reason for a feudal system is that it allows local nobles to
be at odds, adding a political dimension to the adventure background.
This differs from democratically elected politicians in that the
nobility all have a right to rule under law, and if they have
different and conflicting ways to go about it, they just have to cope.
This still happens in democracies, I know, but it is more acute in the
Imperial form of government.  

Feudal systems *have* collapsed in the past in the face of change -
who is to say that democratic systems will survive change of a similar
magnitude?  Before you start extolling the virtues of Republican
Government, look around at the many different examples.  Isn\'t Italy a
republic?  Social concerns are as important as political mechanisms.
If part of Bosnia secedes from Yugoslavia, the result is Civil War; if
part of Minnesota secedes from the USA, the result is legal
proceedings and police actions.

Enough, back to work

	Oh?  It\'s not in the Zhodani - in fact psis in the Zho appear
completely at random and this is part of the background.  As far as I

not actually be detectible in a short period of time, so I would
reduce your +8 if both parents have psi potential to something much
smaller, +2 or +4.

\'Special\' tech:
	In my Traveller universe, certain areas of the Imperium have
\'special\' technologies.  It makes travelling across the galaxy much
more interesting, even though the divisions of technology might seem
completely artificial at first - and in fact they are.  There\'s no
real reason why one world couldn\'t manufacture the same tech as
another planet, provided they install the correct manufacturing
equipment.  THe reasons why those technologies are localized is
because of protectionism, Imperial patent laws and planetary
specializations.  The Imperium might encourage some worlds to keep
their technologies to themselves so that trade benefits.   if
everybody could manufacture anything, then there would be no trade.
So that\'s why some worlds specialize in their production, etc. 
Anyways, my question is, do you use the same idea in your universe?
And what technolgies are so special?  Here is an incomplete list that
I use:
The Darrians:  Star-trigger, advanced gravitics and stealth-jump
drives (drives without the brilliant flare), failproof systems.
Antares: Transparent metals; various metals varying in transparence
to many kinds of light frequency.   The Antares scout ship with fully
transparent underside is a very recent commercial hit.
Ziru Sirkaa: Automated jump drones (torpedoes, courriers, etc)  Their
network does not extend outside of the Ziru Sirkaa.
Solomani: Sandblaster HePLaR drives;  maneuver drives that use
high-power lasers to pulverize sand for propulsion.  The drives have
an alternative setting to use external air in any athmosphere.  
Zhodani: various psi devices.
Droyne:  Well, they could probably build anything, if you could
convince them to. :)
The Ancients; Dehydrated Water, of course.
etc.

	Any suggestions? :)

Absolutely, at least of the federal, or representative types.  (This will 
obviously depend on tech level to some extent; a planetary 
direct-participation democracy might be feasible with a small enough 
population or high enough tech.)  Remember, though, that Traveller does 
provide for the possibility of democratic rule at the planetary level.  
It doesn\'t, however, take into account the possibility that a huge, 
high-tech planet full of people who live under a democracy might demand 
representative government on a wider scale.  Seems like a pretty normal 
course of action to me, but then I wasn\'t raised as an Imperial citizen...
and I guess that\'s what the Imperial Navy\'s for.

A point to remember.  :)  Consider the situation back in the 1850s when 
California was a US state on the west coast -- before the Pony Express,
when Missouri was on the western frontier.  Ships had to round South America
to get there from the US east coast, overland travel being slow, difficult, 
and hazardous....

In Traveller, it\'s due to cultural reasons.  The aristocratic influences are
all Vilani in origin, filtered through the Terran reforms of the Rule of Man
period.  Basically, the all the Rule of Man did was take over the tottering
Ziru Sirka and try to shore up the Vilani caste-system and bureaucracy.  The
Vilani were around when the Imperium was founded -- the Terrans weren\'t. 

What we know of the Third Imperium seems to indicate that the Imperial form
of government is a cross between the old Vilani castes and a strengthened
version of the UN (the Terran Confederation).  Cast the Moot as the General
Assembly, the Emperor as a cross between the Secretary-General and Security
Council, with his Office of the Emperor as the Secretariat....

Of course, this is an extreme oversimplification.  The Imperium has a
military, the ministries, and a somewhat different mission.  But despite
Imperial propaganda, a democracy can work.  It\'s enlightening to note that
the other two human empires, the Solomani Confederation and Zhodani Consulate
manage to operate governments that can make the claim to be democratic.  
The Zhodani have a limited electorate.  The Solomani appear to go through
the motions of being democratic, even if one thinks that their elections
are rigged or one-sided.  So it seems possible that an interstellar 
democracy of all the people could work in Traveller.

I always looked at Traveller as more of a pseudo-feudalistic society.
Similar to pre-instant communication US in that the local areas (sytstems &
planets) are administered democratically (or however the UWP says) while the
overall wide government structure was a feudalistic republic.  The Moot had
to confirm the Emperor (similar to the Electorial College voting for
President).  The interstellar government takes care of the overall
government functions.  In the US these functions were state vs state
disputes, postal system, issues regarding relations with other nations, and
border defense.  In the Imperium these functions would be world vs world (or
system vs system) disputes, xboat system, relations with the Solomani,
Hiver, Zhodani, etc., and border defense.

I know the analogy isn\'t perfect, but it is close.  I believe one of the
only reasons the Imperium is considered a Feudalistic society rather than a
Republic is because the emphasis is on the local representative of the
interstellar government (the local nobility) rather than the interstellar
representative of the local government (the nobility of the Moot).

Of course, this is part of my interpretation of the Traveller nobility (an
issue which has received some coverage here).  I always thought that there
were two main types of nobles.

The first was the Noble appointed(?) to the Moot.  This was a local person
of prominent standing.  Depending on the government structure of this
individuals homeworld (sector, subsector, whatever) this person was
appointed or elected to this position.  This person\'s responsibility in the
Moot was to be the voice of the system (sector, subsector, whatever) in
advising the Emperor on policy and the vote of conformation of that system
(sector, subsector, whatever) when a new emperor was confirmed.

The other type of Noble was appointed by the Emperor.  This person was the
Emperor\'s liaison at the planerary (sector, subsector, whaterver) level.  Of
course the Emperor didn\'t appoint every single one of these individuals, but
only some of them.  The Emperor would typically appoint Archdukes (Domains)
and important Senior Dukes (Sectors) and occasionally Lesser Dukes
(Subsectors) and rarely anyone else.  The lower Nobles (Counts, Barons,
etc.) were appointed by the Archdukes, Senior Dukes, and occasionally Lesser
Dukes.  These nobles answered to the Emperor and did his bidding at the
local level.

Food for thought.

  Damn right! You can look at it two ways: Either the normal
projectiles are of higher penetration than the walls and would,
thus, endanger the integrity of your vessel by firing them, or
they are of lower penetration than the walls and would, thus
endanger the integrity of your troops by ricocheting about the
place.
  Either way guns and space ships do not mix. (Any Military
Submarine types have any comments about weapons policy on
underwater vessels?) Swords are your only man.

  Primarily space troops will have these as secondary weapons
for on-ship fighting. Primarily surface troops which occasionally
get called into space fix bayonets or equivalent (one race
uses axe-heads on the barrels of their weapons).
  In my campaign your have your normal blade weapons. There are
exceptional quality weapons which may have a slightly higher
penetration. Beyond that you have enhanced blades, vibro-swords,
high-tech (mono-molecular?) edges, etc, etc. These do twice the
listed penetration and damage of normal weapons. Beyond that again
you have "ancient" artifacts resembling hand-held weapons made
of glowing plasma (light-sabres, etc) that do three times the
listed penetration and damage.
  When you get to the high levels you have to watch where you
swing the things. They can still cut through computer consoles
and so forth.

  Swords should certainly be a part of dress uniforms in the
Star Navies. Often they are made of exotic substances, eg.
Crystaliron or Ironwood. Some of my players bought one of these
heirloom type swords and finds it generally impressive.
  Another PC picked up a very odd sword. It was actually a
genetically created mineral based quasi-life form. It had
dim thermal awareness and could "smell" living blood. It could
not move on its own but while being swung it could shift liquid
around in internal channels to direct and guide the blade
more accurately towards whatever it smelled. After suitable
penetration puts it in contact with its source it adsorbs
the blood through its hard outer shell creating a small amount
of suction that sometimes makes it hard to dislodge from a
body. When it has "fed" sufficiently its internal channels
fill up making it more sluggish and unwieldy.
  It has also been known to moan on occasion.
  ;-)

You are focusing in fuedalism as an economic system.  It is, in fact,
true that Traveller technically isn\'t a feudal system (it\'s a heriditary
oligarchy).  Semantics aside, such a form of goverment is what has
been historically applied to empires with the kind of communications
lags that the Imperium suffers.

The key here is that you don\'t need _instantaneous_ communications, but
you do need timely comunications.  There are no democracies where
the round tip communications time from the center to the edge is
on the order of two years.

Actualy, if you want to be accurate, feudalism hasn\'t survived beyond
a subsitence economy.  Monarchies and heriditary oligarchies have.

I\'ve always explained the coexistence of Liberal forms of government at the
local level and feudalism at the interstellar by imagining the Imperium as
a customs union with a navy. The Imperium has no direct jurisdiction over
most planets; it merely provides a set of rules for trade, defense against
outside threats, and a common currency. In exchange, it imposes relatively
light taxes on interstellar trade and other transactions contracted under
Imperial commercial law. The Imperial government, while it certainly
presents itself as a unitary government, is not recognizable as a state by
our 20th century standards. It simply does not impose enough burdens on
individual planets to induce them to push for greater autonomy; they
already have all the autonomy they want.

[   Damn right! You can look at it two ways: Either the normal
[ projectiles are of higher penetration than the walls and would,
[ thus, endanger the integrity of your vessel by firing them, or
[ they are of lower penetration than the walls and would, thus
[ endanger the integrity of your troops by ricocheting about the
[ place.
[   Either way guns and space ships do not mix. (Any Military
[ Submarine types have any comments about weapons policy on
[ underwater vessels?) Swords are your only man.

The US Marines maintain security on board its submarines (and all other
US warships, for that matter) using automatic shotguns which are called,
in the jargon, "CAW\'s" (Combat Assault Weapons.) When a security breach
alarm is sounded, all personel (except for the security guards of
course) onboard the ship must hit the deck, security squads of marines
patrolling the ship then immediately gun down anyone they see standing.
This means that the perp will either be dead from standing up, or easily
caught while crawling on the deck.

Of course, the crew lying on the floor get sprayed with buckshot
recoiling from the bulkheads, but the buckshot used in the CAW\'s loses
kinetic energy fairly rapidly, giving it a very short range, (not a
problem on a ship) and  insuring that the ricochet projectiles are not
deadly. (But keep your eyes shut!) The buckshot does not penetrate the
the bulkheads; it merely loses its kinetic energy during the recoil
to deformation, heat, and noise.

I\'m not a military submarine type, by the way; what I\'m telling
you is hearsay.

IMHO, swords will remain important for ritual use, and for combat
on high law-level worlds, but not for miliary action.

The Japanese in WWII used their swords to execute prisoners and maintain
discipline. I always assumed that Imperial Marines used their swords for
the same purpose.

Characters are basically not really convertable, but a rough approximation
is 2 TNE levels equals 1 MT level; the task systems give WILDLY different
chances, but the published tasks (except combat) remain the same.

On the combat side, MT is simpler, and far more deadly. TNE PC\'s can
generally take 2-5 times the damage of an npc, and are not laid up for more
than two weeks if they live (barring infection).

Ship Design (from FF&S) is much like MT; many of the tables crossed over
directly. FF&S mas more goodies. I\'m working on converting them. Will post
a list of what changes, and what works OK as is later.

Advancement & Experience: Mt is slow, steady, and has an upper limit; TNE
is rapid, potent, and has no upper limit. (A 20 year navy man started a
campaign with 41 TNE levels, 2 character years later [4 months of good hard
play, 3-5xp per week of play] same character had 101 levels). Attributes
have no improvement rules in TNE other than in CG, but can be figured; MT
has improvement rules for everything EXCEPT morale.

Summary: MT is Hard SciFi with a few problems...
         TNE is PURE SpaceOpera, which just happens to have Good Tech Stuff.

Hope this helps ( and isn\'t too anti-TNE Biased)

Originally, the absolute max TL of the Imperium was stated as 15. Very
few worlds are at this dizzy height, and most tend to be in the 8-12
band. There were some published lists of stats over the whole Imperium
from DGP which gave averages but I can\'t remember where to look for
them. However, as time went on, designers and writers couldn\'t resist
the temptation to play with better tech, and so we now have a
scattering of TL 16 worlds and one at 17 (sorta).
Pre-Rebellion/collapse of course. 

The Aslan, Zhodani, Vargr and K\'kree had a maximum of 14; again this
has crept up to 15 over time. The Hivers reached 15 with a 16 for
computers and mathematics. The Droyne could only make 12. The Solomani
(as part of the Imperium) have access to 15, with (debatably) 16 in
genetics.

If you\'ve got some time, run through the UPP generation sequence a few
times; that\'ll give you a rough idea of the distribution. Most sectors
were originally randomly generated.

The holocrystal device Jeff mentions strikes me as being the size I
imagined Imperial holocrystals as.  I don\'t know what the storage of the
Stanford crystal is, ut the TL 13 version would have to have sufficient
storage capacity to hold at least an hour of color real-time holographic
video (since they\'re used in holorecorders as well as computers).  I
have no idea what the scale-up factor from video to holo would be, but
since a 1 MB MPEG file runs for about 15 seconds with barely acceptable
video quality, you could be talking about many, many GB!  You also need
to get the read/write apparatus into a package which would fit in a
curent laptop computer (both in volume and power consumption) at the
worst.

Since psi potential (as opposed to psi strength) is a characteristic I
introduced in _my_ campaign with a _house_ rule, I should think I would
be able to define it any way I damn well please. As for the randomness,
I kept that; a character has to have psi potential in order to have any
psi strength, but the psi _strength_ is not linked to the parents\' psi
strength in any way.

The difference is that in my campaign you don\'t have 70% or more of the
population potentially able to develop some useful level of psi ability, 
but only 2% or so.

Well, now we are entering the domain of house rules, but I\'ll tell you =
how _I_ do it. The same problem has always annoyed me too, because, =
according to _my_definition, the mainworld of the system is the world =
with the highest population digit. As far as I can tell, that\'s where =
I\'m deviating from canon, because originally, I think the mainworld was =
just meant to the most \'important\' world of the system. Granted, it =
could make for some necessarily creative explanations, why this pop 1 =
planet is the mainworld compared to this pop 8 planet in the same =
system. What I don\'t like about this is that UWPs become very =
misleading. Say the player characters wishes to find a deserted system =
to hide something in. They look at the UWPs, decide on a world with pop =
0 and make the jump. Upon arrival, they find several heavily populated =
worlds with lots of in-system traffic! I don\'t like that, so what do I =
do?

It\'s actually very simple: I\'ve made the (arbitrary) rule that the =
population digit for secondary worlds is determined normally, with the =
exception that there is a ceiling of the mainworld\'s population digit =
minus two. Thus, a system with a mainworld pop digit of 5 will only have =
secondary worlds with pop digits of 3 and less. A mainworld with a pop =
digit of 2 or less will be the only inhabited world in the system. It\'s =
crude, but it works for me.

Cutlass training had been discontinued when I joined the Royal Navy in the 
late 1970\'s, although my Father can remember it in the 1950\'s when he 
joined.

However, I was taught that the last boarding action in which cutlasses were 
used took place during WWII when the Royal Navy put a party armed only with 
cutlasses on to a German ship to overwhelm the garrison and free the 
prisoners being held on the ship. The action was completely successful - the 
garrison (including machine gun points) was overwhelmed silently and the 
prisoners were freed before the Germans were aware that anything was wrong.

[Typical RN - if something can be done with out of date equipment, they\'ll 
do it!  :-) ].

Would you (or any other Brits or military types) happen to know if the
Gurkhas (sp?) still actually use their huge, ugly knives in battle?  I know
they\'re reputed to, but then they\'re also reputed to eat their prisoners.  :)

There are two potential solutions to this:

1) CT gives some basic prices of food, lodging, etc.  I quote the following
for "fair use" only, and besides, it\'s only about 10% of the book\'s text, so
it should be cool anyway:
        "*Basic Cuisine on a Daily Basis:*  Food is available in a variety
of forms and qualitites.  Prices indicated are per person.
        Restaurant meals of ordinary quality cost  CR 10 per day.
Excellent quality meals range in price form CR 20 to CR 50 per person.
Travellers\' Aid Society facilies provide excellent quality meals to members
and guests for CR 20.
        Food purchased from vendors for preparation at home costs about CR 5
per day, and weighs about 1 kg.
        Preserved foods for rations on expeditions may be canned or packaged
(CR 20 per day, weighs .5 kg) or dehydrated (CR 25 per day, weighs .2 kg,
dependent on locally supplied water).
        "*Subsistence on a Long Term Basis:*  In situations where time
passes quickly, personal survival or subsistence costs can be assumed to be
the values given below:
        Starvation Level--bare minimum of food, CR 60 per month.  Dismal
lodging, CR 60 per month.
        Subsistence Level--reasonable food, CR 120 per month.  Acceptable
lodging, CR 180 per month.
        Ordinary Level--good food, CR 200 per month.  Good lodging, CR 200
per month.
        High Living--Excellent food CR 600 per month.  Excellent
accomodations, CR 300 per month."
                                           Book 3, _Worlds and Adventures_, p.15

2)In MegaTraveller, cr250x[Social Standing] is the amount of money that a
characters should be spending on themselves for food, lodging, and other
incidentals.  Assuming that at Soc 2, an individual is just scraping by,
this can be over-simplified to cr250 a month for food and cr250 a month for
lodging, so the very worst food and lodging you can find will run you about
cr10 per day.  Prices at other Social Standing equivelants is left as an
exercise for the reader :) (NOTE:  At higher levels, MegaTraveller becomes a
lot more expensive than CT, but then you can also assume that part of the
costs are new dresses, manicures, weekends in the country, etc.)

 No, it didn\'t.  But I\'ve had some discussions with some people who
 are somewhat better informed, both in terms of the experiment and
 the theoretical physics behind it, and the low end that I\'ve
 heard suggested is that it will come to market in gigabyte
 quantities.  But that will be kind of like the original 160K IBM
 floppies - or maybe the Apple 143K jobs.  They expect it to
 increase really fast.

Well, I\'m certainly not going to tell them they can\'t! There\'s a Ghurka
engineering squadron based a couple of miles away, and they may all be little
guys (probably about 5\'6" average) but they look tough as hell when you pass
them in town (and smart with it, blazers and smart pants as a rule). As for the
Khukri being ugly, it\'s probably a matter of perspective. It\'s still part of
their official equipment and if they\'ve got them they\'ll use them (I believe
they used them in the Falklands).

    'body' => 'Okay folks. It\'s dumb-question time. Not meaning to pick nits,
but I\'ve recently stumbled across a few oddities regarding some
of the traveller sectors, and maybe somebody out there in netland
can be of assistance.

#1: Is it the Massilia Sector or the Massila Sector? DGP seems
to spell it one way, GDW another. Since DGP seems to have done
most of the work in describing the sector (trav digest 11), I\'m
inclined to go with them, but then again, the GDW-spelling is
probably more official, right?

#2: Allegiance Codes:
    Ma = Maggie\'s Imperium?
    Cv = ???  (appears in Lishun Sector data)
    V1 = Vargr?  (what flavor?)   (lishun)
    V8 = Vargr?  (what flavor?)   (lishun)
    Vv = Vargr?  (what flavor?)   (lishun)
    Vx = Vargr?  (what flavor?)   (lishun)
    V7 = Vargr?  (what flavor?)   (vland)
    Vn = Vargr?  (what flavor?)   (vland)

#3: Base Codes:
    Hinterworlds:  F, J, M   (what do these mean?)
    hint: hinterworlds were covered in challenge #39.
    am i just overlooking something fairly obvious?

#4: This one\'s actually sort of funny. In the Old Expanses,
    there\'s a subsector called the "21 worlds" (covered in
    issue 12 of the trav digest). Sure enough, there are
    21 star systems there (they don\'t give any stats other
    than locations). In the updated DGP data which is online
    at Sunbane (i.e. Nova), however, only 20 of these worlds
    are shown. Please tell me that Lucan didn\'t go blow one
    of them up, or something. That would be just perfect.
    "I wonder what they\'d do if there were only 20 worlds?
    Admiral, set course for the 21 worlds subsector" :-)

#5: One last one. Who exactly came up with the sector data,
    or was the chore spread around a bunch of different folks?
    I see in some of the trav digests that James Holden,
    Nancy Parker, Robert Parker, Philip Athans, Mike Mikesh,
    David Ridell, Mike Jackson, Clay Bush, John Meyers,
    Aleatha Parker, Dale Kemper, John Theisen, J. Andrew Keith,
    and (pant... pant...) a veritable swarm of multitudes were
    credited for several library data articles covering the
    various sectors, and some of these articles have maps
    while others go so far as to give UWP data for each and
    every world. Did these people actually create this data, or
    was it simply handed to them by somebody else for them to
    expound upon?

far too much of the overblown space operas of the 30s and 40s.  There are 
other, more interesting (to me) answers.  Snub pistols were mentioned as 
being designed for this purpose.  Their recoil is low and the 
penetration for all shell types except HEAP is 1.  They basically can\'t 
accidentally harm anything in the ship.  In addition, sonic stunners (if 
used), gas rounds, and for the very high tech, neural weapons all all 
good choices for non-military shipboard combat.  

For military battles things become a bit different:

Laser pistols (TL: 9) and Gauss pistols both only have penetrations of 4. 
This is enough to penetrate all standard vacc suits, but if every major
piece of equipment on a military starship had armor of at least 8 they
would be useful weapons.  However, if the military is fighting other
military it is likely that everyone is wearing at least Combat Armor TL-12
(armor value 10).  No hand weapons except Axes and Harlberds (not very
convenient to wield in a starship corridor) can do anything against this
type of armor.  In addition, most slug throwers and lasers have trouble
handling this type of armor. 

The weapons that can penetrate such armor and do significant damage are 
also a danger to the starship.  The problem is much worse when dealing 
with TL 14 armor (AV: 18).  To achieve a high penetration shot on that 
kind of armor you risk using a weapon that can shoot through the hull, 
and destroying the ship they are trying to capture.

I\'m not sure of how to get around this problem, other than to say that
mostly military forces just blow up starships at a distance rather than 
attempting to board.

Well Sorry to inform you but marines do not provide security on US
submarines. Aircraft carriers and large surface combatant ships are the only
one that have Marine units on board. On other US ships the sailors provide
the security for the ship typically the personnel are drawn from the weapons
handling/firing divisions on board the ship. Also as to gunning down anyone
who does not get prone!, get a better source of info please!!! The only
instance of gunning down might occur if the person encroached the zone of
the "Ready Aircraft". The discharge of weapon onboard a US Naval ship is a
very serious matter. If you do it you had better have perfect reason for
same. Contrary to what you might have heard the persons issued weapons have
guidelines in which they can use "Deadly Force", and they also have to have
good judgement. I personally have had the chance to discharge my weapon into
two officers that broke the rules but did not, I have no regrets either, the
officers made a simple mistake. The shipboard security personnel are not
grid locked into rules/orders unlike what you might have heard.

Well on the ships that I was stationed on the issued weapons were colt .45,
Ithaca pump riot twelve gauges, and M-14\'s. As to firing in the corridors
well there is a lot a electrical wiring routed thru the walls that protrude
out into the corridor.

  Last time the Carrier JFK was in Boston, Ed Barach & I spent hours in the
hot sun waiting to get on board.  It was worth it.
  One of the displays was the weapons used by the Shipboard Security Marines.
M-16 w/ M-203
M-92 9mm pistol,
M-60 GMP
12 gauge pump shotgun.

  When asked about the shotgun, the Marine on duty spoke of it fondly. :-)
They loaded Double-0 buckshot.  A couple of shots would fill a shipboard
corridor with a dozen .30 caliber rounds bouncing off the metal floor,
ceiling, and walls.
  Good shipboard weapon.  Fills the corridor, doesn\'t penetrate, good 
stopping power.
  Jump forward a millennium or so...The ship is a starship, the boarders
are wearing combat armor at least as tough as the ship\'s bulkheads.  Any
weapon that can breech the armor, can damage the ship.
  Have the shot gun fire \'tanglers\', perhaps even designed to gum up the
target\'s comm gear and sensors.  Then advance with that Space Ax!

FASA published a supplement for CT which had prices for a wide variety of

 :)

The Gurkhas are still issued Kukris as part of their official equipment, 
although I\'m not aware of the last time they were used in battle. The 
Gurkhas were scheduled to go into the line in the battles around Stanley, 
but the Argies surrendered before the Gurkhas could be used. They did, 
however, apparently fight a number of minor skirmishes when they were 
clearing Lafonia (the big uninhabited bit on the bottom of East Falkland), 
although they record that the Argies surrendered before the Gurhkas got in 
close (no surprise - I would too!).

The Gurkhas have a rule (possibly a superstition, although I don\'t know that 
for sure) that a Kukri must draw blood every time it is drawn. For this 
reason, Gurhkas cut their own thumbs every time they draw their Kukri.

Finally, yes the Gurkhas are reputed to eat prisoners. After 2 Para took 
Goose Green, Brigade moved the Gurkhas up to Goose Green to guard the Argie 
prisoners there while 2 Para moved forward for the final assault. When the 
Paras handed over to the Gurkhas, they told them to smile at any POW who 
gave them any trouble (they had told the Argies that if a Gurkha smiles at 
you, he\'s planning to eat you!). I have seen a Gurkha\'s smile - and it\'s one 
of the most blood-curdling things I have ever seen.

Apologies if anyone\'s offended by this conversation going off at a tangent.

  Wrong comment. I fight with a halberd in the SCA (Medieval Re-creation).
I\'m willing to bet that the armour I wear is, if anything, more bulky
than a vacc-suit or combat armour and that the bridge battles that I\'ve
fought in are a good approximation to ship corridors.
  While touring Cahir castle it struck me that my weapon of _choice_ for
defending some of the narrow corridors would be a halberd. You don\'t need
much lateral room to use a halberd effectively. Most motions are either
stabbing or chopping. You stand more sideways than straight-on. You
can fight two abreast in all but the most narrow corridors.
  A three rank deep formation would be ideal. However two ranks is
probably the most likely. (You need pole arms longer than 2 meters
for three ranks which would present other problems on ships.) The
first rank is primarily defensive to stab and deflect those coming
in. If you are defending or static they can kneel for extra stability.
The second rank then fights over the first rank. Mainly smashing/cutting
strokes from above or using all those wonderful prongy bits to catch
opponents off balance so your front rank can get an opening and stab
and undefended vitals.

  I\'ve only fought with an Axe a few times. Can say much specifically
there. However I can see weapon and shield tactics being useful. Say
your enemy doesn\'t care about their ship and does want to use bullets,
tanglers or shotguns. March a phalanx of axe and sheld marines over the
deck and up the corridor. Think of a shield as supplemental armour
right where you need it. Worked for the Greeks and Romans :-).

>No hand weapons except can do anything against this type of armor.
  See my previous post about my high-tech variants with better
penetration. Even if you don\'t accept vibro-swords, mono-molecular
bayonets, or chain-bardiches, look at a different approach.
  The main "problem" with high-penetration projectiles is that
if you miss they might blow a hole in something you would rather
they didn\'t. Look at how they slaughter cattle, though. They have
a small hand-held "gun" with a very short barrell. You press it
against the cow\'s head and it activates.
  Take this design and put your high-penetration bullets in it.
Mount it on the end of a stick (or whatever). You basically have
a spear/thrusting sword with a powerful kick. Since it only activates
when in direct contact you don\'t have as many strays.
  [Now, of course, part of the reason these bullets have high-penetration
is because they accelerate down a long barrell. For this design
you might have to put the chamber in the "hilt" and use the
shaft for the barrell.]
  Imagine this sort of like fencing with rifles :-). Touche!

>I\'m not sure of how to get around this problem, other than to say that
>mostly military forces just blow up starships at a distance rather than 
>attempting to board.
  That would be a cop-out. Get over your "problem" of swords
in space and tally-ho!

That depends upon how you look at it. Yes, GDW were the actual owners of =

Personally, I go for Massilia myself for another reason. Massilia is the =

All the Vargr codes can be found in DGP\'s Vilani & Vargr.

The other questions I can\'t answer.

   The ax would be your best bet.  The classic E.E. "Doc" Smith Space Ax.
Made out of very dense, high tech material, with a cutting edge and a
piercing spike.  It\'s a weapon requiring skill to weild effectively against
armored foes.  An armored knight feared a skilled foe with a poinard more
than a peasent with a bill hook.  
   An idea I had was for a retractable \'ice pick\' of crystaliron or SD 
material built into the forearm of Battle Dress.  Like the poinard of old,
it would be used against the weak points of armor.  Such as the joints or
faceplace.

   Depends on what you want.  If you want the ship, you minimize
the damage.  If you want the cargo, you just try not to blow up the ship
or at least the cargo bay.

   This is a safer tactic.  You only board if you want to capture the
ship, or something/someone on it.  A Princess involved in the Rebel
underground for example.  :-)

Tergen Orbital On-Line

The Tergen sector information service has gone on-line,
with a modest offering of data available concerning
this remote and often-overlooked sector.

Features include likely animal enounter tables for
the sector (seems to be off-line at this time), 
personality types occurring in Tergen, and general 
data sheets for 10 subsectors.  According to our
contacts, the other 6 subsectors are too perilous
to have been mapped thus far.

A highlight of the service is the on-line ship design
system from the Engra Shipyards, a glimmer of 
(relatively) high technology and research in an 
otherwise unimpressive sector.  However, it too
still seems to have some wrinkles to iron out.

At this point the heart of the issue has become one of taste.  I prefer 
(somewhat) realistic SF, such as Babylon 5 to Star Wars style space 
opera.  The games I run reflect this.  

Ship\'s troops using hi-tech swords make sense for a space opera campaign, 
snub pistols and stunners make sense for more realistic SF.

1st of all don\'t assume everyone will be in Combat Armor.  Standard Crew
will likely be in the least encumbering Vacc Suit they can wear.  They still
have to run the ship while the battle rages around them.  For a standard
VAcc Suit, a Rapier or other Thrusting weapon will suit very well to punch a
relatively small hole and distract the opponent long enough to at least
patch the tear.  A Cutlass or other slashing weapon would rip a big one and
probably be a combat kill.

2ndly the Military may very well use cutlass against non-military enemies
like Pirates etc.  These are unlikely to use anything other than a Vacc Suit
anyway.

Lastly the last point made about blowing up ships is perhaps the best.  Why
Board anyway?  Unless there is a reason just blow \'em up real good.  If you
have to board, its not likely a capital ship anyway, and the scale will be
smaller.

Lastly the Imperium is sort of a kindler gentler time in which honor does
mean something.  Troops adhere to rules of war, and try to limit collateral
damage.  Once again cutlasses might prove useful to sort of force the enemy
to use the same.

 Which is more official for the capital of the People\'s Republic of
 China - "Peking" or "Beijing"?

 That\'s about how I view this kind of difference - both "Massilia"
 and "Massila" are reasonable "Galanglicizations" of the Vilani
 name for the sector, "Masilaa".

Hey, this gives me an idea!  It\'s not unlikely that all other part of
Humaniti evolved the Homo Sapiens Sapiensis-style cranium of today,
but what about (the mostly ignored major race) the Darrians?  They
have a wider pelvis than Solomani & al, and the book claims that 
cildbirth problems are rare with the Darrian.  

        I\'ve ALWAYS hated the "Elves-in-space" look of the Daryen,
but
what if they kept the prognathous cranium?  The lower, longer
braincase?
It wouldn\'t mean their intelligence is any different than the other
races, but the rest of Humaniti might look upon them with some
contempt,
calling them "low-brow".

        Of course the rest of the body would have evolved from a
powerful
barrel-type body to a slight, spy one... With a very distinct head.
:)

Besides, there\'s so little documentation on the Darrians and so few
pictures... I don\'t think many people would mind a new \'twist\' to the
Darrians. :)

A very good point.  You\'d think that with the potential capabilities of TLs
10-15,
more lethal weaponry would have been developed, especially for use on high
tech, high pop "civilized" planets (especially Vilani-background worlds, where 
they really do care for the group/crowd/masses).

> The sonic stunners may be a bit outside the Imperium paradigm

Yes, but a sonic cone projecting at high volume, low hertz (pitch) can have
two effects:

o   One level (I think 12 hertz) causes an uncontrolled fear response.  This
is a bit iffy,
    as you may induce a fight (berserker) response rather than flight or
surrender.  But 
    most (human) folks just break down, cower and shake.  Most Vargr (and
K.kree, on 
    a different setting) try to sprint away.
 
o   A lower level (I think 8 hertz) causes a human\'s sphincters to open (kind 
    of demoralizing, especially in armor).

You would, of course, need various settings for various races.

(I\'d give affected PCs and NPCs an initiative roll against it, with minuses for 
holding (rigid, vibrating) solid objects and wearing rigid armor

Another option is various goo-guns and goo-bombs - these basically project a 
super-glue foam that immobilizes a perpetrator.  Goo-guns are short ranged, 
but goo-bombs can be shot using standard-sized grenade launchers...  These 
(which are being worked on now, actually) can be easily available by TL10, and 
get better (stronger) as TL rises...

Certainly it would be very easy to add a new bullet type to FF&S: rubber
bullets 
with say two steps worse penetration, but full knock-down effects for each
hit.  
These can generally be designed as low-power ammunition.

Joe Walsh comments:

No, it more shows the roots of Traveller in the mid-70s, where there was very 
little in the way of non-lethal weapons available beyond tear-gas.  Mace and 
pepper-sprays were just coming into existence. No one had heard of rubber
bullets.  And it was (probably) assumed that PCs would have little interest in 
these items.

"The FCI Consumer Guide". Lots of stuff from TL 0 to TL 7. Lots of prices
for clothing of various types. There were several different brand names for
each item and they had different AF (availability factor) and RF
(reliability factor).
Don\'t buy unless you as a GM are afraid of setting prices. Pick up the

In my completely unbiased opinion, Hard Times is absolutely the best
supplement ever put out by GDW and required reading for any Traveller player :)

Seriously, it\'s a supplement that sets up rules and scenarios dealing with
the years immediately following The Rebellion (1125-1130).  Nobody ever won
The Rebellion; all the factions remained, but by 1125, the widespread
destruction brought about by the war weakened all the factions to the point
that none could engage in any serious offensive against the others.  The
leaders withdrew to their greatly reduced "Safe" territories, leaving the
worlds between to fend for themselves in a sort of "no-man\'s land".  Hard
Times gives rules for implementing these changes on the worlds that were
left behind, and what sort of adventures characters can get involved in there.  

I like hard Times (in case you hadn\'t noticed) for a number of reasons.
With the advent of MegaTraveller, the Imperium had become both too big and
too small for my liking.  It was too big in that the Rebellion was such a
huge conflict that individual adventurers couldn\'t do much about it; it was
too small in that it seemed that virtually every sector of the Imperium had
been described in some detail, so there were no surprises for adventurers.
With the advent of Hard Times, there was no telling how badly worlds had
been damaged by the fighting until you got there.  A planet might have been
reduced from TL12 to TL6, so loading up on laser rifles would be out of the
question.  It might not even be easy to land; the former Class A starport
could be a huge crater!  Also, the scale of problems were reduced to
something that could be managed by a party of adventurers--evacuating
refugees, driving off pirates, or even simple salvage operations.

 Which is more official for the capital of the People\'s Republic of

 That\'s about how I view this kind of difference - both "Massilia"

    'body' => 'Hi All.  The discussion on sonic stunners has been missing a fundamental 
point: differing atmospheric densities.  Depending on what world you were 
on and what the weather conditions were, the stunner would have to be 
calibrated differently.  This would be quite a complex thing, though not 
outside the capabilities of a small computer and air-pressure sampling 
device.  You would also have to calibrate the stunner based on race (and 
perhaps the size of the opponent?).  A sonic stunner would not work in 
vacuum or trace atmospheres, and would probably have difficulty in very 
thin ones.  Depending on the exact nature of exotic atmospheres, there might 
be problems here as well.  Also, rain and snow might have adverse 
effects.  When in water or dense atmospheres, the stunner might have 
better range, though it would have to be properly adjusted.

This sort of calibration problem is common with other non-lethal weapons
as well.  Tranq rounds, for instance, have to be adjusted to body 
size of opponent as well as species.  This is why lethal weapons are favored 
by police forces: they are a known quantity.  Even a 300 pound guy on PCP 
will be "stopped" by a bullet (though he may not feel it), but he could 
very well laugh off a tranq round designed to safely sedate a 120 pound 
person.

Yes, this is intentional. The previous few issues of the TNS had
carried warnings of a virulent computer virus which was causing
widespread disruption throughout the Imperium. This virus was rumoured
to be some sort of Final Weapon unleashed by Dulinor or Lucan in an

thanked me for doing the survey, and to you I say "you\'re welcome and 
thanks".  Now here are the results (drum roll please): 

There were 63 total votes.  According to Rob Miracle, there are over 500 
individual addresses which subscribe to the list, so we may not have 
quorum, but here\'s the breakdown of the votes:

Option	 Votes	Percentage
1	 5	(08.0%)				
2	 6	(09.5%)			
3	 3	(04.8%)
4	 2	(03.2%)
5	23	(36.5%)
6	 2	(03.2%)
7	15	(23.8%)
8	 7	(11.1%)

In the likely event that you didn\'t memorize what the options were, 
here\'s a recap:

1. Leave Traveller and Xboat alone, create new mailing list for New
Traveller.

2. Leave lists as are, but discuss New Traveller on Xboat.

3. Leave lists as are, but discuss New Traveller on Traveller.

4. Leave lists as are, and discuss New Traveller on either/both.

5. Create single list for all game versions.

6. Create several lists divided by topic, such as technology, history,
rules, etc.

7. Create new list for TNE, discuss New Traveller on Traveller, and leave
Xboat for CT/MT.

8. Other (please specify).

Option 5 was the clear winner, though 7 may be a closer second than it 
seems, since option 1 was very similar (only the names of the lists are 
changed) and individuals voting for one often indicated in comments that the 
other was also a preference.

Most of the option 8 voters were calling for a "wait and see when NT 
comes out" approach, though there were one or two calls for instituting a 
news group instead.

For those of you who sent in votes in an improper format, rest assured 
that I did go through your messages and included your indicated 
preferences in the survey.

I have not had time to do any stats on the numbers above to see what the 
confidence limits are or anything like that, but I may do so within the 
next week or so.


NOW FOR THE EDITORIAL PORTION OF OUR PROGRAM:

There seems to be a split between two major groups here, which I will 
call the Fractionalists and the Unionists (Fracs and Unis for short).  
The Fracs seem to think that it is a logical progression to go from 2 
lists for two game versions to 3 lists for three game versions.  The 
problem of cross posting does not concern them as much as it does the 
Unis.  The Unis want everyone to be one happy family and get everything 
back together again.  The Unis hate redundant postings.

Personally, I put myself in the Frac camp, and prefer option 7 or option 1
(three lists for CT/MT, TNE, and NT, respectively).  My main reasons for
this are as follows: 

1. One big list (i.e., option 5 or the Unis position) would lead to
confusion in new players, who would be confronted with a list where 50-75% of
the material would not be about the version of the game they just bought. 
They would have to figure out the whole history the Traveller game
versions and then sift through to find the NT material they were
interested in. 

2. One big list would result in very large digests which would contain a
great deal of information irrelavant to anyone\'s particular favorite game
version.  For instance, I do not want to have to sift through a bunch of
FF&S designs to get to the CT/MT/NT stuff that interests me, and I\'m sure
there are others who just the opposite.  Also, individuals paying for
storage would have to pay extra for information they don\'t want. 


Having said that, I could live with the Unionist option if some rules 
were instituted along the following lines:

1. All messages would be clearly labelled as to which game versions they 
applied to.  A prefix system might be one way to do it:  CT/MT, TNE, NT, or 
ALL would go before the message title.

2. All messages would have to have a title.  No more "Re: Traveller 
Digest 666" or similar vague subject lines.

3. Quoting previous messages would be limited.  No more pasting in 5 
generations of replies on a particular topic.

4. Any message which was over a particular length would be labelled as 
LONG in the title.

5. Flame wars would be quickly extinguished or moved to personal email 
addresses.

If we are going to have one list only for all Traveller versions, then I 
would suggest that the TML FAQ have an article (similar to one posted 
recently) explaining the history of the game.  Another idea would be a 
list of often used acronyms (e.g., TML and FAQ :-), so that newbies would 
not feel lost.

Well, that\'s all the ramble I got in me.  
Comments? Criticisms? Ranting Flames?

	For the record, I\'m a \'Frac\'.  The above would be fine by me as 
well, though.  Yet I wonder just how such things will be enforced.  If a 
person repeatedly, say, posts with the subject: line being "Re: Digest 
XXX," yet their posts are good, are they going to be kicked off?
	It just doesn\'t seem to be a very viable option to me.

I\'m new to the Traveller Digest as well as to the Xboat Digest so I am not
familiar with any previous treads that may have been exhausted. I have a
question regarding what may be one such "expired" subject:

Who sets up and runs a starport? From what I can learn from the various
sourcebooks available to me, starports are considered to be local affairs.
A planetary government or a company (or a combination of the two) are
responsible for the construction and maintenance of a starport. But how
does this mesh with TL. I mean, you can get a, say, A starport on a TL-7
world. How can that world conduct overhauls on TL-15 craft (or construct
starships for that matter)? Do they rely on imported parts, materials, and
machinery? If so, what if the nearest world with TL 15 were located far
(15+ parsecs) away? Wouldn\'t that affect prices?

I hope somebody can help me out.

Projecting a cone of =8910 Hz sound reguires the gun to have a cone or other
sound director on the same scale as the wavelength of the sound. 10 Hz
gives dimensions about =8935 m. As far as I can tell handguns would be damne=

In fact starports are NOT local affairs. They are even more than 
airports today, considered to be territory not belonging to the 
planet (country), but to the Imperium. The town which lies next to 
the port however is planetary territory. So the weapons restrictions 
of the planet do not apply to the starport (though it may have it\'s 
own, and once on the starport, the local police can\'t directly get to 
you (although you might be extradited).

This is how i always understood the status of starports! Correct me

The one thing I *wouldn\'t* like to see is TNE messages.  I\'ll admit up 
front to a strong personal bias against TNE (for a variety of reasons), 
but I really feel that TNE material is likely to have less 
cross-relevance than material for any of the other variants.  Not only is 
there a different game system, the basis of the technology has changed, 
and there is a very different feel.

If people want to play TNE, that\'s their business, and I hope that they 
aren\'t left unsupported the way I was, because that sucked.  But:

I have no interest in TNE, and no desire to see anything about it.  I\'d 
have to say that I would not be a member of any mailing list that included 
TNE stuff, and I doubt I am alone.

saved many of the posts) so far, and hope to see more.

I see these discussions as a way to bring greater depth to the game.  
That is, it brings an aspect of the game (guns) from the mythical level 
to the realistic level.  Instead of cardboard guns, I can now have more 
realistic guns.

When I was doing the research for the RPG I wrote seven years ago (which 
was never published - I\'ll write a post about that sometime), I ended up 
delving into a lot of weaponry and armor research.  None of the 
literature I perused on this subject was specificially for RPG\'s, yet 
reading them improved my understanding of combat paraphanalia.  This, in 
turn, improved the role-playing experience for me and my players.

I vote for continued non-flame discussions of weaponry.

>

Both of these are relatively the same so, I comment on both.

This is good.  I especially like the organization right now.  FOr instance,
I don\'t subscribe to TML because I don\'t play new era.  However, I think
that the TML should become the NT list, and that TNE should get a new one.
I only say this because the "Traveller" Mailing List should be about the
latest version.

>2. Leave lists as are, but discuss New Traveller on Xboat.

This depends on how alike NT will be with CT\\MT.  If the rules are extremely
similiar, it could work.  Then again, the rules might be too different.
Another problem would be that background discussions about CT\\MT may confuse
players of the (supposedly) timeless NT.

>3. Leave lists as are, but discuss New Traveller on Traveller.

Same as two, it depends on how alike the systems are.  If the system is
identical to TNE then it shouldn\'t be a problem.  (See comment about number 2)

>4. Leave lists as are, and discuss New Traveller on either/both.

This I don\'t like.  Only becuase the rules for NT may be distinctly
different from one of the systems.  This would make a lot of annoyance for
players of one of the system who would have to sift through mail that they
definitely don\'t want.

>5. Create single list for all game versions.

No, the differences in both games systems and background\\story are too much.
People ont he list would again have to sort through a ton of mail, or have
extremely long digests to read.

>6. Create several lists divided by topic, such as technology, history,
>rules, etc.

The only thing I don\'t like is that some areas may only be popular to some
people, and would therefore not have too many messages going back and forth,
making it more like a private e-mail discussion than a mailing list.  Also,
I personally find it better to get discussion about ALL aspects of CT\\MT
becuase usually something about almost each post interests me.

Lastly, I read int he original results post that some people suggested a
newsgroup.  Although it may sound good, I think a (for example)
rec.games.rpg.traveller would have the same problems as option 5 with lots
of topics being discussed that some people don\'t care about.  FOr me, I can
only read newsgroups on line, so it\'d be a waste of my precious hours
online.  Then again, you could create seperate newsgroups (eg.
rec.games.rpg.traveller.mt, etc.) for each game system.  However, I
personally prefer mailing lists to newsgroups due to the fact that I can
read mail off line.

	According to Marc Miller and Ken Whitman, NT will be 80% classic 
traveller, 20% new material.  Thus, the CT Book 2 ship combat rules will 
be there, as will the Book 5 rules.  But both will be "expanded in light 
of 20 years of role-playing experience."  
	I have no idea what the expansions will be.
	But I have been repeatedly assured that NT will be compatible 
with all the prior CT material (adventures, supplements, etc.).  In fact, 
it will be so compatible, there are deals in the works to get the classic 
third-party material (such as Paranoia Press and FASA stuff) released on 
CD-ROM so that folks can use that material with NT.
	Hope this answers some of your concerns.

    'body' => 'Hi There,

Like Henric Ahlrot (Starport Confusion), I\'m new to the Digest too so I
also hope I\'m not going over old ground.  Henric\'s problem seems linked
to the whole question of radically different Tech Levels located close
together and in commercial/political/military contact within a thousand-year
(or more) old civilisation.  This state of affairs doesn\'t seem very plausible,
but figuring out why it might have arisen is part of the fun of
being a Traveller GM!

With regards to the Starport question, G.M.s might rule that the starport of
a low tech (or low population)  system is maintained by a large central
Authority for strategic or economic reasons without regard to the wishes (or
knowledge) of the local inhabitants.  The starport might then be located in
orbit around the major gas giant of the system (for easy access to fuel) for
in the asteroid belt(for easily exploitable raw materials).  The tech Level
of the starport could then be assigned to be high (strategically vital),
average or low
(for obsolete backwaters and piratical merchant interests) depending on
the permissable max T.L of the campaign. 

On the same theme, I would rule that starships (or anything else) cannot be
repaired or built on a world without the required tech level.  It would be
difficult to get your 1996 Lap-top (T.L.8) fixed in 1911 (T.L.4)or even in
1975 (T.L.7).  Interestingly this might work in reverse, too.  It might be
quite difficult to find someone with the skills to repair an 1885 steam
locomotive nowadays.  However, the extensive technical databases and
flexible nanotech manufacturing of high-tech societies might get round this
problem.

Henric\'s question about prices also raises an interesting question about
interstellar economics.  I am not an economist (as will soon be apparent!)
but here are some thoughts.  For space-faring cultures even the rarest raw
materials are abundant (in asteroids etc) so the prices must be very low.
Similarly, advanced automated production processes must make the prices of
finished goods 
cheap too.  What then is the Interstellar economy based upon?  High Tech
manufactured goods is one possibility, but what do the low tech economies
have to exchange for them if their usual bargaining chip (minerals etc) is
also monopolised by the high tech cultures?  Food is another possibility since 
the number of worlds able to mass produce food must be relatively low, but
making synthetic food probably isn\'t beyond high-tech capabilities either.
I have a feeling that the Imperial Government (or whatever) would have a
very centralised command-type economy, as the Roman Empire did in some phases.  
Licences to exploit certain (or all) raw materials would be granted
according to quotas in order to maintain their relative value, leading to
illicit production and smuggling.  I\'d be very keen to hear other ideas on
this subject.

[snip]

Interstellar trade is a diffucult subject in Traveller.  This is because the 
ship designs available and (presumably) most popular among the planets of the 
Imperium (and beyond) do not seem to be able to support any significant 
interstellar trade at all!

Alright, as is my custom, when I see a traveller inconsistency I ignore it 
and treat things as I think thye *should* be.  Hence I feel there are many 
vessels of much larger tonnage (a design of which was posted to one of the 
mailing lists recently) i.e. in the 10,000 to 1 million ton range roaming 
about, unseen by the published documents.  They are moving the stuff of 
interstellar trade about.

What are they moving?

Unlike the previous poster, I do not think that mineral wealth will be found 
in any asteroid belt one happens to encounter.  There are going to be 
resources in any large economy which are rare and can be traded for finished 
goods or other resources in other places.  

Go back to the Merchant Book (book 7? - the purple one I think).  They have 
many ideas which get the theories flowing; Novelties are big among them, as 
are recorded items - music, movies, etc.  

Part of this implies to me that there is greater trade among world of close 
tech level than among planets with disparate tech levels.  Why would a TL7 
planet want holographic recordings after all?  (maybe they\'ll broadcast \'em 
in 2d over the television?).  

It is also plausible that lower tech worlds have resources (Lanthanum 
deposits? large laser-quality diamond deposits? Wood?) which would lead the 
higher tech worlds to intentionally manufacture something marketable at a 
lower tech level, but pretty much unsalable at their own.

Whatever happens, I think we will always see natural resources as refined as 
possible on site due to the high cost of shipping offworld.  Why would anyone 
send wheat offworld when the equipment to seperate the chaff and make flour 
(or whatever...) can be brought in on the same ship?

Food

I think we should never to see a planet (with a pop greater than about 4) 
which relies on interstellar sources to supply its population with food.  It 
would be ridiculous to inhabit a planet without self sufficiency in this 
basic area.  Can anyone else think of a good reason for this happening?

It would take immense amounts of dedicated tonnage, at enormous cost, to 
support any significant number of people.  Likewise with water. Any planet 
whith high technology would find a way to support itself, if possible.  In 
Glisten (asteroid belt mainworld, pop of 9) I have postulated (yes, contrary 
to, or rather without knowledge of the JTAS article on the same world) that 
they have (at TL14) set up a recycling ecosystem which only requires sunlight 
and an influx of water and minerals to maintain.  This means large vats of 
plankton and other hydroponics.  They get the influx of water and minerals by 
mining asteroids and moons (some of which are icy bodies) in the system.

Enough.  Does anyone have a seriously complete program for determining 
randomly what trade goods are available on a particular planet and how much?  
I have never been satisfied with the systems I have seen so far.

I hope we don\'t get into a flamewar about this.  I have no objection to
discussion about weaponry on the list - after all it plays a large part in
many Traveller campaigns.  However, as with many threads, I think
we ought to keep an eye on the relevance of what we post to
Traveller.  There comes a point when some threads have moved
away from their origins considerably, and, while interesting, do not
have that much to do with Traveller.  In cases like that, maybe the
particpants should think about moving the discussion to e-mail.

An analogy would be a discussion which starts off discussing grav
vehicles in Traveller, then moves to discussing lower tech transport,
which moves on to discussing 20th century Terran transport which
then moves on to comparing the Ferrari with the Lamborghini.
Fascinating for all the fans, not so much so for everyone else.

I am aware that there is probably a cultural split between posters in
the US and posters in Europe.  Quite simply, the number of people
interested in guns as a hobby or interest is far less in Europe than
it is in the States, for a whole variety of reasons, not least of which
are the differences in availability and legality.  As a result, discussions
which centre too much on Real World gun discussions, as opposed
to Traveller gun discussions, tend not to be so interesting to some
members of the list from outside the US.  An analogy would be
some list members from Europe discussing governmental
structures in Traveller, using the European Union as examples of
governmental structures, and then ending up talking about what
is essentially European politics rather than Traveller.

I\'m not trying to start a flame war, and I do not wish to offend anybody\'s
views on issues relating to guns.  I\'ve tried to keep my personal
views on the subject out of this deliberately so as not to perpetuate
the argument I am concerned this could slide into.  I just wanted to
offer a small plea for consideration amongst all sides of the views of
the others.

My, that all sounded awfully serious.  Anyone got any views on
a less contentious subject such as hurling rocks at planets,
feudal technocracy or the scientific plausibility of the Virus?   ;-)

I know I\'m on the wrong list to be complaining about this, but this strikes
me as the epitome of conceit.  As I was led to beleive, the mailing lists
were designed to support Traveller with GM\'s ideas on adventures, ships, and
other things.  While I can appreciate the fact that Virus and the TNE rules
offended some CT/MT players and the creation of X-Boat was warranted, I am
very offended by the implication that because I prefer TNE I am incapeable
of coming up with any new ideas that might be useful to others.  I\'m
terribly sorry that I didn\'t have the opportunity to purchase CT, and I
regret that, unlike other folks on these lists, I haven\'t had umpteen
million years of role-playing experience, but them\'s the facts.  My lack of
years in role-playing doesn\'t mean I have a lack of creativity.

I have a feeling that the general consensus is that when the new Traveller
comes out, many people will be using the new rules.  I for one (though an
avid TNE fan) can\'t wait for the return of thruster plates.  I also plan to
convert my TNE stuff to the new Traveller format soonest, and I anxiously
await the publication of Mileau 1200: The Reformation Coalition.  

As far as you not reading anything TNE, you might try subscribing to the
traveller mailing list(the list for TNE) for a week or two.  You might be
surprised at how many messages from TNE supporters you receive and find
useful.  There are a number of cross posted articles.  I also think that you
might find yourself in the minority as far as people who don\'t want to read
anything about TNE and "would not be a member of any mailing list that
included TNE stuff."  The number of people who subscribe to both lists is
amazingly high; it makes me wonder why we have two lists in the first place.
I know realize why we have two lists, though.  The folks who are in charge
are much nicer than I am and chose to support the few people like you who
couldn\'t accept the fact that something good might come from TNE.  In my
opinion, the fault is with your own creativity and not with TNE.

My humble apologies to the sane sentient people on this list, but I was
tired of reading TNE bashing on TML when a TNE person simply uses the TNE
list to voice his dislike of something CT or MT.

	Abundant only in the sense that there would be more available 
than there is on a single world.  But pricing is determined by (among 
other things) the supply /in relation to/ the demand.  The Traveller 
universe has a lot of raw materials available, but they also have a 
demand to match it.  Lots more people, businesses, and governments means 
lots more demand.
	So, it does not necessarily follow that because the supply of a 
given thing is great it will be cheap.  If the demand is great as well, 
the price will follow.

I find it absolutely amazing that people are griping about "gun posts" on a 
list devoted to a game written by a WARGAME DESIGNER, published by a WARGAME 
COMPANY and whose rules are at least 66% concerned with WEAPONS and COMBAT.  If 
you are personally offended by firearms, that\'s your business, but given the 
number of different people making posts about firearms, its obvious that most 
people on this list have some level of interest in the subject.

Ordinarily, I would not be some forceful, but I recently got a couple of flames 
sent to my work E-Mail for having the outrageous nerve to post about Weapons of 
Non-Leathal Intent on X-Boat.  Unfortunately, I deleted the messages out of 
annoyance before I came up with a reasonable response, but I consider those

  By an odd coincidence, I was reading World Builders Handbook last 
night, and there is a rule in there for miniumum tech levels of 
starports, something like an A starport has minimum TL 10 within the 
starport bound for repairs and such, and so on for lesser tech levels for 
lower rated ports.  Of course, if the system as a whole has a higher 
rating the starport will be at that tech level.

  World Builders also cointains a variety of suggestions for interpreting 
system USPs - email me if you want more details.

   Compatible is relative.  It could be something that *mechanically* isn\'t
compatible with anything released previously, but story-wise fits with
the previously published material.  TNE was compatible with all the
classic Traveller adventures, so long as you were willing to ignore story
development after 1116 and changed a few references here or there.

   The truth is that no one at Imperium Games had anything to do with the
development of TNE (probably a qualification for employment), nor is it
likely that they have even opened a TNE manual, let alone played the
game.

   They are either outsiders (people brought in by Marc Miller to be part of
the team) or people who have worked on classic Traveller or
MegaTraveller in the past.  The basis of their work therefore will be their
experiences with classic Traveller and MegaTraveller, and things they
have worked on since.  Our input does seem somewhat important to
them, as Marc Miller has asked in the past for us to send in e-mail voicing
our opinions on what the next generation of Traveller should be.

   Knowing that, I would look for something that has the feel of the
originial rules set c. 1986 (just before the release of MT), and is
mechanically similar, but with lots of add-ons, corrections and deletions.
High-Guard style ship design, but not High Guard ships.  MegaTraveller
style vehicle design, but not MegaTraveller vehicles.  It is possible you
will see design sequences similar to those in FF&S later on, but not those
same exact ones, and they will most likely be much simpler.

   Frankly, it is not in the best interest of Imperium Games to make a game
that is too similar to the original, as what incentive would people such
as myself (who owns Books 0 - 8, plus supplements, etc.) have for
buying it?  

   However it comes out, I would expect it to be a high quality project with
excellent production values.  Worth taking a look at, even if you  (Tom)
plan on continuing to use TNE and campaign in the New Era setting for
now.

Regards,

Harold

Hi everyone,

I\'ve perked up the Java Subsector viewer a 
bit with multi-threaded behaviour.  You should
now get "please wait..." messages when you have
to wait.

My next improvement is (I think) going to be
sector dot-maps for the sector selector.

Oh, also - it now supports double-clicking.

Please send me any suggestions!

	The scenario you portray could very well be true.  However, in 
reading the Marc Miller interview from AOL, and from two phone 
conversations I have had with Ken Whitman of Imperium Games, it does not 
appear to be so.  But, I may have misunderstood what I was told.

	Remember that Marc Miller is the one who is in control of this 
project, not those at Imperium Games.  He gives final approval for 
everything.  He sets the direction (as he called it, the "vision 
thing").  It is certainly true that the people at Imperium Games come up 
with ideas for the game, but it is also true that those ideas don\'t get 
into the game without Marc Miller\'s approval.
	So even if those folks are completely unfamiliar with CT (which 
the new version is supposed to be based upon), Marc Miller is definitely 
not unfamiliar with it.

	This is purely my opinion here, not based in any facts at all, 
but it seems to me that they wouldn\'t scrap the ships we\'re all familiar 
with.  They may not all be there, and there will probably be some new 
ones, but the most popular ships will, I think, still be there.  (I\'m 
talking about ships from CT, not necessarily vehicles from MT.)

	I seriously doubt that they are counting on people like us, who 
have CT material up the wazoo, for a majority of their profits from NT 
rules.  I think (hope!) they want to sell to a much larger audience.
	And, even if we do have all the CT material ever published, we 
are certainly potential customers for new material such as Milieu 0, any 
new Adventures to be published, JTAS, etc.

I\'ve seen a couple explanations of this, one of which was:

The Vilani named the sector first; Massilia is a Terran near-cognate,
and was adopted.  The Vilani still call it by their name.

However, the Vilani name was not Massila (which I\'d wager is a 
misspelling).  I have the listing at home, so I\'ll try to remember to look
it up...

Hi all. Well, I\'m finally done revamping my sector viewer,
formerly known as galactic.zip. The new version is called
gal20.zip and is currently available from the programs section of
my homepage at http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~jimv/

This is a pretty hefty upgrade, so I\'ll go through a brief list
of attributes & requirements:

   *  Allows you to randomly generate sectors via both the
      traditional method and a variant method which has its roots
      in a Traveller Mailing List discussion dating back to 1993
      (included with the online help). You can also display the
      maps, of course, and it translates into English the UWP
      code of whatever world your "cursor" is on so you don\'t
      have to sit there with the book open.

   *  Keeps campaign notes in text files which can be accessed
      directly from the subsector map. The maps all mesh
      seemlessly, and access to your campaign notes is a single
      keystroke away. You can even organize your notes under a
      system of menus if you want to keep them organized.

   *  Thirteen of the Classic Traveller sectors are included
      along with a variant universe sector which I\'ve just
      started to create (the Classic sectors came from the
      Sunbane ftp archive). All the sectors come complete with
      jump routes, incidentally, and several world write-ups by
      Rob Dean are also included with the Spinward Marches
      sector.

   *  Lots of online help. You don\'t even have to know much about
      Traveller in order to use this program. Basically, it was
      designed both for long-time players as well as for people
      who are curious about the game and are thinking of "getting
      into it."

   *  Built for DOS but, of course, also runs under Windows. You
      must have at least VGA graphics capability and over two
      megs of free diskspace.

   WARNING:   You must use "-d" option when unzipping:

      >>>>>>>>    pkunzip -d gal20.zip    <<<<<<<<

   Available Now:  http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~jimv/
   (go to the programs section and look around)

Let me know if you have any trouble getting the program. I\'ll
arrange for alternate distribution methods in the next day or
two. If your access is limited to email, let me know, and I\'ll
try to arrange to postal you a disk (you will owe me a world
description or two though :-)

Somewhere around here...

I can\'t find it right now, but a few years back I created an Excel 4.0
workbook that detailed planets using WBH rules.  I also added a sheet that
printed out \'trade tables\' for every planet. (Rather like the old Book 2
trade, but with more generic items from more catagories.)

I\'m trying to find it now.  Remind me in a week if I haven\'t posted anything.
 You might also be able to find it on GEnie, where I uploaded it five years
ago.

Hmm, while I belong to both lists *and* have all three versions of Traveller, I
must say that I disagree with you and agree with Joseph. I do *not* want to see
TNE specific stuff on xboat. I suspect that that\'s what he\'s objecting to. And,
unfortunately, that means - no TNE Ship designs, as they are completely
incompatible with CT and MTrav; no Adventures in the RefCoal or Democratic
Domain of Deneb, as they exist in a future that many (if not most) people on
this list reject. What does that leave? A lot! Anything of a non-specific
nature - stuff that is likely to apply to any and all versions of the game
would be quite welcome. If it is too TNE specific, however, I really don\'t care
to know about it *on this list*.

And good luck to you, but don\'t hold your breath, as (as I\'m sure you noticed),
Imperium Games has indicated (unless they\'ve changed their minds on AOL?) that
the RefCol Milieu book is going to be a *considerable* way down the track. So,
unless Trav4 is a rip-roaring success, it may well never see the light of day!
And, of course, if Trav4 *is* a rip-roaring success, they may well never do it
because they will presume they will be able to make more money doing Milieu 0.

Sorry, but most of the stuff on the TNE list is a waste of bandwidth for a
CTrav or MTrav referee. All those ship stats, all those RefCol World Histories,
and stuff like that, are garbage as far as I am concerned ... some of the other
stuff is OK, but since Thruster Plates rule in my idea of Trav, and there never
was a Virus, then the rest is pointless (though, at least in the case of the
Planetary Histories, it seems well enough done; I presume the ships are as
well).

How many people subscribe to xboat as opposed to traveller? *Are* the
Ctrav/MTrav people in a minority? As to why we have the two lists, I thought it
was obvious ... many people thing that HePlar is revisionist and that Virus is
incredible (in the sense of unbelievable) stupidity!

I\'ve recently had the opportunity to peruse a very early first draft of the

superb job that takes Trav4 equipment (and tech) into the realms of Science
Fictional futures that have been undreamed of in all previous editions.

This is advanced technology that is *really* advanced ... a great deal of
thought has been put into integrating it all and extrapolating current trends
rather than simply taking outmoded tech and calling it "futuristic" as has been
the tendency in the past.

Anyhow, I think that everyone on these lists will like it when they see it. And
if the Central Supply Catalog is half as good, well, we\'re in for a real treat!

I didn\'t bash TNE.  I am quite capable of bashing TNE, should I choose 
to, but I didn\'t.  All I did was say "I am not interested in reading 
about TNE."  That is not an attack on TNE, it is a statement of personal 
preference.

It is almost certain that there would be something on a TNE list I would 
find interesting.  It is possible that there would even be something on a 
TNE list that I could use in my campaign.  As I do not run TNE, and I do 
not use Virus, I would wind up having to sift through a lot of stuff that 
wasn\'t relevant to me to find the useful things.  I have to do enough of 
that on the Net as it is.  I do much less of it on this list, because the 
subject matter of this list is relevant to my game.

The poster who responded to me was extremely insulting, and I am tempted 
to reply in kind -- but I don\'t think this list is an appropriate place 
for format flamewars, and I\'m not going to rise to the "challenge."  The 
existence of this much defensiveness on the subject (all I did was say 
"I\'m not interested in TNE," and I got flamed) should serve as a warning 
about the possible consequences of combining the lists.

This subject has been touched on the TML I think and as far as I can see
the problems are several and the benefits are few. One has to throw out a
lot of historical canon as distances between empires, neighbouring
relations et c will change drastically. It is also somewhat impractical to
use without a computer, 2300AD manages this by having a fairly small map
but the huge Imperium is another matter. TNE could certainly use 3D maps as
so much is unexplored/forgotten terrain and in a TNE setting I\'d say the
added realism would make up the extra work. Also year zero T4 could use 3D
maps as the empire had just begun at that time but MM will probably not do
away with the 2D map.
Another place where 3D would IMHO give more rewards is in space combat. My
group had a 3D spacecombat system for a while in the 80s but we felt the
extra work didn\'t pay off (we didn\'t and don\'t use computers during play,
only for designwork, database and chargen).

I have been working on 3 d star renderings for a while now.  Given a fairly
small volume of space its not hard to convey the 3D information through
visual clues.  Developing the Traveler universe has some other problems,
that are going to kill canon and/or reality one way or another.  You either
ditch the distance relationships, or accept a drasticly higher number of
systems -- most of which will probably be uninhabited, buit they will be on
the map.  And trying to reconcile the known locations of stars (currently
only decently known to about 20-25 parsecs, but soon the be completely
revolutionized by the Hipparcos mission) with where you want to place
generated systems further out so that you don\'t end up with an extra star in
the big dipper gets to be a real hair-puller.

I agree with this one.  If you are up to the math and don\'t worry too much
about gravity, this can be done by hand -- but its gets to be a drag.  I am
working on what I hope ill be a decent multi-player computer game, but for
copyright reasons I am working it back up from the raw physics.

There is a group playing traveller in a 3d universe that has made their
maps available; afaik, it doesn\'t use the imperium...

Traveller\'s mapping is 2D, always has been, and, while it is a fudge, it
makes it playable.

Take a look at Phil McGreggor\'s Space Opera for the problems of 3D mapping;
while the sector books were well done, visualizing borders is well nigh on
impossible! (No offense, Phil).

2300 managed, as well; however, having a 2.1 parsec limit on deep-space
travel keeps down the number of routes, and most of the available routes
were presented on the corners of the big map included in the boxed set. (I
only ever found 1 in 3 years of GMing 2300.)

Doing so for traveller would also require utilizing one of several
solutions, which were ranted down a while back:

        1)      keep the existing maps as a central plane, and add worlds
                above and below it.
        2)      Keep the existing map as a planar reference, and move existing
                worlds up &/or down within their hex
        3)      use really nasty maths to keep the relative routes the same
                distance, and trash the existing maps.
        4)      Make entirely new maps and ignore that which came before;
                put key worlds the right travel time away, and completely
                redo the rest
#1 Adds worlds... way too many of them.
#2 changes the extant routes because the distances can change WILDLY.
#3 Throws out the extant material, and is next to impossible, as somewhere,
someone is gonna gripe cause their faovorite spot is either too close or
too far from some other spot. It would also make the imperium look much
less imposing.
#4 just keeps the basic feel, but is easily enough done by using someone
else\'s maps, and assigning Traveller UPP\'s to all the worlds.

X::>>For space-faring cultures even the rarest raw

X::>If they\'re abundant, then they\'re not rare :)

 It\'s a matter of relativity.  When you have 11,000 worlds to draw
 on, you probably have as much diamond as you could possibly want -
 but that doesn\'t change the fact that diamond is a lot less likely
 to be found than nickel-iron.  So, it\'s comparatively rare.

 Also, the rarity of a substance/product will depend in part on the
 demand for it, and the ease and cost of getting it from the
 production point to the consumption point.  Nuteman dragon meat
 may be available for pence per tonne on Nutema, and everyone can
 eat as much dragon steak as they want - but how much is it going
 to cost to transport a tonne of it to Terra, even in a secure,
 unified Imperium?  That\'s going to drive the price up, and make it
 comparatively unavailable on Terra.  Also, available ship tonnage
 for dragon meat may only be able to transport a fraction of what
 is demanded.  That makes dragon meat rare on any world that can\'t
 get the quantities that the market demands.

X::>>Similarly, advanced automated production processes must make the prices of
 ::>>finished goods

X::>At high tech levels

X::>>cheap too.

 Not necessarily.  What\'s the cost of maintaining and replacing the
 machinery that implements the automated production processes?
 What\'s the cost of transport off-planet?  What sort of taxes are
 collected upon export?  Are all of the raw materials needed
 provided locally?  If not, how much does it cost to bring them in?

 Note that the transport capacity and demand issues apply here,
 too.  It\'s quite likely that high TL stuff is in heavy demand on
 lower-tech worlds - possibly beyond the available transport
 capacity.  Also, distance from source is going to be a factor in
 the price on the destination...

 ::>[snip]

 What is the international economy based on?  High tech nations can
 produce high-tech manufactured good, and usually have techniques
 that will allow the raw materials to be produced cheaper than the
 low tech nations can do it.

 Except that wages in low-tech nations are lower, allowing these
 nations to extract raw materials at more competitive prices.  And
 "social capitalism" or "capitalistic socialism" is a good system
 for these nations - foreign investment is welcomed, but either
 repatriation of profits is limited, or the state or a local
 company must own a significant (possibly 51%) share of the
 operation, or both.  There are ways, artificial to be sure, of
 making low-tech competitive, or at least necessary, to/with
 high-tech.

 Why else would countries like the United States have their panties
 in a twist about jobs being exported offshore, to places like
 Central America and the Far East?

 Well, those ships are the ones that player-characters will be most

 with supertankers to the same extent as they are with the much
 smaller cruise ships?  Or the still smaller personal vessels
 (yachts, sailboats, etc.)?

 Many?  Not necessarily.  But they exist, and they suffice for the

 Probably.  Also, it\'s reasonable to assume that they\'ll also be
 carrying "luxury goods" and information, which will _always_
 command high prices.

 Yes, it was Book 7, and it was purple.  Title, "Merchant Prince"

 That\'s one possibility.  Another possibility is that trade is
 really localized to clusters of worlds, quite likely with overlap
 between clusters, but not a lot of direct trade between central
 worlds in different (even adjacent) clusters.  So, there might be
 trade between the Jewell cluster and the Regina cluster, but
 direct trade between Jewell and Regina will be low, and between
 either of those and Glisten or Mora will be vanishingly small.

 Only if it can be done _and_ transported at a lower cost than it

 TL_6_ stuff for that TL_5_ world.  Military goods are likely good
 candidates for sale as well.

 Not on a permanent basis.  But temporarily, during a planetary
 disaster, isn\'t unreasonable (the local flu bug has mutated, and
 the entire hydroponic crop of blackroot potatoes was killed.  We
 need to import enough plants and enough potatoes to tide us
 through the crisis, while we find a cure for the blackroot
 blight).

 Water, especially, since its volume can\'t be reduced at any

 mine it from the icy bodies of the system, or, worst case, to mine
 the gas giants for hydrogen and oxygen, and make the stuff
 yourself.

You might want to get your hands on the Alien modules that were released,
they are: 

Vilani and Vargr: The coreward races
Zhodani and Droyne: The psionic races
Hiver and K\'Kree: The exotic races
Solomani and Aslan: the rimward races
Humans and Nonhumans: the minor races

I only have the fourht (S&A), but I must say that it\'s an incredible book.
The shear amount of work is enormous!  

Also, you might want to consider picking up 101 Vehicles, which is a good
book is your character spend time on planets.  Lastly, the Starship
Operator\'s Manual is pretty good.  I don\'t own it, but I was flipping
through and thought it was pretty cool.

Well, I won\'t take *all* the credit (or blame) ... actually, Ed Simbalist did
the co-ordination and put together the stuff that I and Mark Ratner did along
with his stuff. I know that I didn\'t do the 3D mapping system ... but whether
Mark or Ed did, I\'m not sure (I *think* it was Ed). In any case, I always had
the impression that the assumption behind it was that borders in any real sense
were nonexistent in space ... all you have to defend is the point targets
(Planetary systems). Though I will agree that I never liked it much either -
and I tend to prefer a flat-space system ... and if I ever get my own SF RPG up
and running fully (it\'s in an advanced state of semi-completion), then it will
have some form of 2D flat space mapping ... it does as it stands, but I\'m not
100% satisfied with it.

First, my sincere apologies to Joseph Saul.  My previous post was entirely
out of line, and should not have been sent.

Second, my apologies to all of you CT/MT fans for the same reason.

My post, however, served it\'s purpose.  Mr. McGregor seemed a bit irritated
(as I\'m sure many of you were).  He had a right to be irritated as did Mr.
Saul.  This only serves to support my main point:

        XBOAT is for discussion of CT/MT topics and TNE has no place being
here unless it is to be bashed (and XBOAT is the appropriate place to bash TNE)

        TRAVELLER is for discussion of the current version of Traveller
(This means TNE folks).  TNE should not be bashed on TRAVELLER, and yet (as
those of you who subscribe to both lists know) TNE is bashed almost whenever
it is hailed. My purpose was to turn the shoe onto the other foot.

Again my apologies to all and my thanks for hearing me out.  No hard
feelings I hope.

Referee\'s Companion:
        The Large Scale Combat Rules are wonderful, but not so involved as
most mini\'s systems. The Research rules are nice, and it\'s got the
in-system travel and transfer times. The racial capsules are not bad, but
not enough for PC\'s. Collection of forms in the back.

World Builder\'s Handbook (or Grand Census and grand survey):
        The world Detailing system is indispensable when you need a
kickstart for the imagination. I just wish someone would make it available
on the MAC!

*Also nice to have, but not in the Required pool:

Starship Operator\'s Manual
        A detailed guide to life aboard a small tramp freighter, and
expanded task and procedure charts for ship operations. I wish there were a
volume 2.

1001 Vehicles
        Includes enough vehicles for most games.

I did something on these lines for known space/2300AD some time ago.
Back in the mists of time ( late 1970s ) a guy from the British
Interplanetary Society published the BASIC code for an APPLE II for a
program called STARGATE, which would take a star list and display
either:

a) A "night sky" view from around any on the database
b) A 2D map centered on any star with any chosen third axis shrunk to
zero
c) A "psuedo 3D" tank view, with the chosen star at the centre of a
cube, and the other stars correctly in perspective around it.

All of these could be zoomed, rotated etc

In the early 80s I re-wrote the program for the BBC Micro in BASIC,
and in the late 80s I re-wrote it again for the Atari in C/GEM. I put
it into the public domain and it got pretty good reviews. I added a
few extra features ( like the ability to plot routes and have the
program "animate" the journey), but the core of the program is those
original trigonometry alogorithms.

If anybody wants the source or Atari executable then please e-mail me.
I do have it in the back of my mind to update it, probably into Visual
Basic, and if there\'s a lot of interest it may move up a few places on
the wish list.

I must admit I have toyed with how to take the 2D traveller data and
show it as 3D, and I do think that maybe T5 (!?) will have to bite the
bullet and move away from the 2D maps!

Finally, some time ago I picked up the folowing URL for a program
which sounded very simlar to STARGATE but I\'ve never found time to
check it out. URL is ftp://ftp.maths.tcd.ie/pub/jaymin/cherryh.  The
files needed are chv-data.zip, chview.doc and chview.exe. You may want
to check it out.

  I\'ve run a 3D traveller campaign for years. No problem.
If you keep it fairly small scale you can do it with
printouts. If you want to go to any scale you *can\'t*
do it without computer support. Even then it is workable
enough.
  More recently, though, I\'ve begun running a Bughunters
campaign. [For those of you who missed this, this was the
Aliens-like rules for TSR\'s Amazing Engine system.] This
is set in near-earth 3D space.
  They include a fairly colourful map and an appendix of
data on 3D space in the back. It is an absolute bitch to
try to do anything with this. Sure, the DM can work a few
specific things out in advance but any decent player
would balk at all the computation involved. (Eg. just
how far _is_ Delta Pavonis from Ross 154?)
  Fortunately I have been working on 3D Star Viewing
software for a unrelated project. It has this useful
feature where you can define one (or more) "civilisations"
and give them an expansion rate. It will then work out
what stars they colonise and add this to the data.
Using this on a database of about 9000 stars within 250LY
I\'ve marked the stars explored or colonised or with stations
as well as the major jump-routes.
  Think of it like "Campaign Cartographer" for Space.
  Now the players can view their universe, call up data
and plot routes for themselves. As a DM I can work out
appropriate relations and campaign background.
  [I would note, I have actually produced a 2D abstract
map of colonised space "For Earth Senators" that I use
for abstract planning :-). Similar to the one in the
actual Aliens Role Playing Game.]
  The beta version of this software is on ftp.maths.tcd.ie
in the pub/jaymin/chview directory. It will be released
in a week or two formally.

There are ads for Mac software at the back of WBH from DGP but I\'m not
shure if it ever passed vaporware status. I have made a utility that
expands a standard UPP/UWP string to an entire starsystem with moons,
gasgiants et c. It doesn\'t follow WBH rules to the letter but it should be
usable and it\'s free.
I\'ll post where/when it will be available.

I\'m a bit puzzled about the status of low tech (<= TL5) planets in the
Imperium. I want to keep this type of world in my game, but find them a bit
difficult to explain.  Low tech worlds have little or no political or
economic clout, and no military influence at all.  Historically, high tech
nations have colonised and exploited low tech ones, so why has\'nt this
happened in the Imperium?  The IISS protects the most vulnerable ones by
banning contact, but how do the rest cope with their powerful neighbours? On
the same theme, why do these worlds exist at all.  Does anyone have any
interesting models for low tech worlds, other than the "Lost Colony" model
which is getting a bit dog-eared nowadays.

About face! Does anyone have any tips on role playing life on one of the
ultra high tech worlds, those above, say, TL13?  What would these societies
be like?  I ask because I\'m trying to avoid presenting these worlds as being
just like 1996 except with more gizmos.  Victorian sci-fi writers predicted
space travel, submarines, robots and so on, but did\'nt predict computers,
global communications or the electric toothbrush.  I know their aim was to
satirise their present, but they rarely examined the impact of technology on
society.  How can GMs avoid doing the same thing?

Actually, there\'s a rather LONG list of minor human races. I compiled
them as part of a collection of race descriptions I put together.  There are
a few minor human races (some rather wide-spread) that fit this bill:

o   the Cafadi (corridor sector)
o   the Geonee (spread all over Massilia sector)
o   the Feskals of Florian (Trojan reaches, though they don\'t travel much)
o   the Suerrat (Ilelish; these were the people Dulinor ruled)

And there are stranger still human races, but those have been geneered...

>They have a wider pelvis than Solomani & al,
Not "et al"; wider than the Solomani & the Vilani, perhaps, but there\'s a lot
of morphology involved in humaniti.

But they didn\'t.  It\'s documented.

Of course, they probably do that for most of the groups listed above. But only 
when they find them away from home.  :-)

But it didn\'t, a point that is well-documented.

I don\'t know where you get the idea that the Daryens are not well-documented
They were covered in CT (they had their own Aliens module & articles in JTAS), 
MT and are described in TNE\'s Regency Sourcebook, complete with a physical
description.

Actually, only 2 of these ever came out.  Solomani & Aslan (Rats & 
Cats), and Vilani & Vargr (Bogs & Dogs).  DGP cancelled the rest of 
the series, when they realized that GDW was pulling the plug on 
MegaTraveller in favor of T:TNE (Traveller: The Nilsen Ego).

They are however excellent works, with tons of backgrounds, sector 
data for a couple of sectors, vehicle designs, robots, and great 
background stuff.  I also heartily echo the person who recommended 
World Builder\'s Handbook.  A great reference.  Lots of cool ideas.

This varies widely.  A starport can be owned by a local planetary government;
a local balkan government; a private corporation; an imperial organization 
space navy, scout service, imperial colonial government.

In this case, the technology to operate and maintain the Starport obviously 
comes from off planet.  A TL7 world can only maintain a TL7 starport - and 
at TL7 (pre-stellar), there are no starports.

It doesn\'t.

yes

>If so, what if the nearest world with TL 15 were located far
>(15+ parsecs) away? Wouldn\'t that affect prices?
The location fo the nearest TL15 world has a large effect on the price of
TL15 products.  Each product has to be hauled (for 15KCr per ton) from
the TL7 world.

There are added rules that discuss the price and availability of high tech items
on lower tech worlds.  I tend to add a factor for distance as well, since
shipping
people and items is so expensive.

In such a set up, in my campaign, the TL7 world would at best be able to send
a message on the next available starship to ask for assistance.  Be prepared
for a long wait until someone at a TL15 world responds.  And be prepared to pay 
a lot for that service...

Now someone from a closer world may get wind of your problems and show up
and offer to swap out you TL15 bad parts for some TL12 parts they have for less
cost (and some degradation in performance or size or power requirements) and get

Do not mistake ownership with the rules that govern the operation of.
Henric\'s question was who builds.  In Traveller, most of a planet\'s main 
public use starports have extra territoriality, subject to imperial law...
but the
imperium does not build or maintain the starports.  If so, all starports would
have the same TL.  They do not; the have a TL usually based on the local TL
because that\'s who builds and maintains it.

In my campaign, this may well vary by planet.  Check local law before 
committing crimes on planet :-)

Unfortunately, only 1 and 4 in this list were ever published (although
if someone can tell me I\'m wrong, I\'d be extremely pleased!) which is
a pity because they are truely stonking pieces of work.  Perhaps T4
will revive them.  I\'d also advocate 101 vehicles and 101 robots (the
latter is technically CT rules - but compatible with MT).  These two
are even more useful if you are willing to ignore the descriptive
paragraphs which indicate that the item of equipment is (say) Solomani
when you are adventuring in (say) the Spinward Marches.

My take on 3D space:

I\'ve played with this, and it is very easy to do, I think. I\'ve never
actually got around to creating a campaign using it though.  Assuming
that you want something inkeeping with the published 2D
representations, I use the Preserve Maximum Linear Distance (PMLD)
assumption.  If you look at an (8x10) standard 2D subsector, then to
PMLD within the subsector (12.8 parsecs) then the nearest you can get
is a cube with 7 parsec sides.  This means the largest distance you
can travel in a straight line and stay in the same subsector is about
the same.  Sectors are then cubes with four subsectors on a side
(inkeeping with PMLD), and Domains are cubes with two sectors on a
side.  If you take "standard" density as 40 worlds per subsector
(ie. 50% of 8x10 2D subsectors) then in 3D standard density is a 12%
chance of there being a world in a given cubic parsec.  The choice of
sector size means that a "standard" sector has 2560 worlds (cf 640 in
2D).  However, because I\'ve used PMLD, the size of a sector (in terms
of travel times, etc.) is the same for the 3D case as it was in the 2D
case.  Most of the discrepancies between 2D and 3D background occur on
the large scale - if you convert the Imperium to this system, I think
it comes out as containing 400,000 worlds - again they are all within
the same commo lag as in the 2D case.

I\'ve even come up with a mapping grid - 2 x 4 boxes, 7 parsecs on a
side, with the eighth box containing the map legend.  It works quite
well, although I suspect commo routes need to have some ingenious
method of representation, and are probably difficult to determine (a
lot of worlds can be within 4 parsecs.)  I think tables of "worlds at
2 parsecs" etc. will probably be useful, or some sort of overlay
template which allows you to see which worlds on the map are at 1, 2,
3, etc. parsecs.  You also have to decide things like: Is a distance
of 1.4 parsecs jump-1 or jump-2?  The second choice makes jump-1
starships far more restricted, and probably reduces the number and
length of mains dramatically.

I have wondered if 3D maps would work if they were
presented in bite-sizes.  

For instance, the 2D subsector has what?  about
80 hexen on it?  So, say it has about 40 stars
on it.

An 16x16x16 light-year cube would have about...
hmmm... 

	16/3 ~ 5 hexen per side?

 5x5x5 hexen ~ 125 cubic hexen, or

              ~ 64 stars in it?

Now, to build a cube subsector, form an octet of
these cubes.  Sure, it\'s nonstandard, but hey, 
we\'re way off canon by now anyway.  And what
is Traveller canon but a Montana speed limit?

I guess crossing a cube border might involve
some calculation, but the smaller-size octets
make local manouvres easy and visualizable.  
Also, I put the scale in light-years to make 
up for the cube size decrease, for a finer 
granularity.

It looks alright, and it \'feels\' more technical,
whereas the Imperial subsectors almost feel
terretorial or politic.

2 Yen\'s worth.

West office.  Part of this involves moving ftp.mpgn.com, which also
processes the mailing list.

The physical move of this machine is still a couple of weeks off, but to
prepare for it, we are moving the mailing list to a machine in Key West much
sooner, like tomorrow (5/8).  This is in conjuction with changing from
Listproc to Majordomo as well.  This will hopefully solve some of the
reoccuring problems like having everyone on the list postponed, or people
being removed every Friday because of a bounce.

Here is what is going to happen.  Tomorrow morning, we will shut listproc
down for a couple of hours and move the subscriber database, converting it
to a majordomo format.  The aliases will be adjusted so that mail to:
traveller@mpgn.com and xboat@mpgn.com will go to the majordomo version.  At
that point we will be up on majordomo.  We will restart listproc, and let
the partial digest expire and be sent out.  So you may get two partial
digests tomorrow or Thursday.

Posting messages will not change.  You will continue to post to
traveller@mpgn.com and xboat@mpgn.com.  What will change is administrative
options.  If you are digest and want to go to instant, you send a subscribe
message to traveller-request@mpgn.com, and send a unsubscribe request to
traveller-digest-request@mpgn.com.

Digests will have a slightly different format, and will have a different
file name in the archive . . . Which brings up the archive:  Since
ftp.mpgn.com is a couple of weeks from being here, we will go ahead and
archive the messages.  You  can do a majordomo get to retrive them.  When
ftp.mpgn.com arrives, we will load the digests to that machine and away we go.

With any luck, this should be fairly seemless to you and things should run a
bit smoother.

	Hi all.  Following the results of the survey on the future of
TML/XTML, several people have called for the unification of all lists into
one.  This was the option that clearly won in the survey (somewhat to my
disappointment, but hey that\'s the democratic process...) and people seem
to want to get this going now. When I started the survey, my idea was that
this was simply an opinion poll.  I was not thinking that the results
would be implemented right away.  I would like to wait for NT to come out,
and run another poll at that time to confirm opinions.  Following this, we
could change/combine the lists. I\'m pretty sure Rob Miracle is not going 
to change anything before then in any case.
	While I\'m on the topic, I would like to re-iterate my strong 
support for some system of rules to be implemented if we have one big 
list.  I\'m not expecting Rob Miracle to censor the list or anything.  The 
rules would be informally enforced.  Whenever anyone signed up to the 
list, they\'d get a note outlining the "netiquette" of the TML/XTML.  
Offenders would simply recieve notes from list members reminding them of 
the guidelines (I would do it, and others who get peaved by this sort of 
thing would probably do so as well.).  Repeat offenders might be dealt 
with more harshly, especially if they engaged in frequent flamewars.  
Here again is the list of rules I would recommend.  Anyone want to add 
to/subtract from/modify this?

Historically the high tech nations pulled away from colonization when 
they discovered that the return wasn\'t enough to justify the cost.  Maybe 
these low tech worlds can be sources of cheap labor, except no one but 
the wealthiest could afford the products they produce (although a black 
market would surely exist).

I can think of a few reasons why low tech worlds may persist:  (1) a lack
of resources to build the required infrastructure, and hence a lack of
interest from outside parties; (2) a rigid government that stifles
advancement in the interests of controlling the population (and
maintaining its traditional source of income); (3) some other social
institution that forbids or anathemizes the use of non-traditional
technologies. There could be many other reasons.

WBH gives worlds a "novelty" TL based on the highest TL of their 
neighbors.  This represents the tech that\'s available to those who can 
afford the price.  Even if the low tech world has a few people 
knowledgeable enough to reproduce such novelties, the world would lack 
the ability to construct the facilities capable of mass-producing them 
(without outside help) and possibly also the transportation 
infrastructure to distribute them.  I think using an analogy of the 
relations betwen industrialized countries and "third world" countries 
might give at least a starting point.

To the best of my knowledge, only \'Vilani and Vargr\' and \'Solomani and Aslan\'
were ever released. For the K\'kree, Zhodani and Droyne you\'ll have to go back to
the CT alien modules (the Darrians also appeared and the overlap of content on
the Vargr, Solomani and Aslan races between the CT and MT Alien books isn\'t
complete, so you might want those as well if you ever see them). The Hivers have
both the CT Alien module and their TNE appearance in Aliens of the Rim (which
subverts some of the CT assumptions).

While we\'re talking about aliens, anyone have any idea whether T4 will have any
significant alien presence? The Vilani are the only major race close to Sylea,
so we may see more development of the non-Solomani humans instead.

Actually, the "Elves in Space" from my campaign were the "Illyeshka" which
were human-ish only they *averaged* 7ft tall.  A very xenophobic race, those
of them who had any contact with humans were considered odd by their race\'s
standards.

The small amount of contact that existed was in a gem trade and a medicinal
herb trade.  Typically the only things they were interested in from humanity
was vegetarian foodstuffs and wine. 


I used to love taking fantasy races and re-working them for Traveller, let a
party encounter some them and see how long before they realized "..hey! That
was an Ogre!"

I damn well please with it!". :)

I wasn\'t aware of the Geonee\'s and Suerrat\'s prognatism, because I\'ve
never paid any attention to them.  So I suppose my idea isn\'t very
original :).

As far as the Daryen look being documented, well I\'m sorry there
aren\'t really that many references to the true Daryen look.  I own
the Darriens alien module (in fact I only miss K\'Kree, Hivers &
minor races - oh, and someone just stole my Zhodani!), and they make
no references to the cranial features of the Darrian.  They only tell
of skin, eye and hair tones.  And some of the sources are
contradictory - someone pointed out (I think it was on the TML, a
long time ago :) that some pictures of the Darrians show them without
the pointy ears.   (Although that can be explained by the fact that
other parts of humaniti live in Darrian space).

Anyway, my point is that the look of the Daryen should be a little
more original - I thought I had a good idea, but I guess it\'s been
done. :|  I\'ll keep using it till I find something better then. :)

PS:  I recently made a table to generate the hair/eye/skin tone of
ANY member of humaniti for random encounters, based loosely on
somebody else\'s previous work. :)  I\'ll post it if anyone wants it -
it works fine for correct hair color, etc, but I\'ve never seen a
Zhodani with knee-lenght hair. :)

Just some ideas:

   Maybe some of these low tech worlds could be inhabited by
   voluntary low tech societies who are rebelling against 
   or simply dismissing technological advances, something like the Amish
   or the "free love" communes of the 1960s.  Often these types
   of communities are, in general, low tech but need some contact with
   the outside world (i.e. have some need of star ports).

Actually, since price of shipping is the same per jump (regardless
of how long the jump is), the cost to ship over a distance depends
on how you ship it.  Ironically, if you ship it on a fast jump 6
ship it is cheaper than if you ship it on a slower jump 1 ship.

     Someone forwarded your mailing to the HIWG mailing list to the general
\'old Traveller\' mailing list (xboat@mpgn.com).  Since you solicit feedback,
I\'m pleased to be able to write to you.

     If you don\'t mind, I\'d like to enthuse for a paragraph or two.  I have
been a fan of Traveller since the day after the first boxed set arrived in
my local hobby shop in 1977, although the last Traveller product that I bought
was Survival Margin.  (Not your fault, after your time and all that!)  I still
keep a copy of Starter Traveller (the most compact form of the rules) tucked
into my briefcase, just in case I feel like fiddling with it a bit.  My
collection of Traveller materials includes everything issued by GDW and DGP
for CT and MT, plus assorted things from other people (with Gamelords books
being my favorite third party material.)  I\'m very pleased to see that the
rights are reverting to you, and I hope that you will be able to get something
back into publication in short order.

     I would like to offer you my services as well.  I am a freelance proof-
reader as my second profession, and I am very familiar with the existing
Traveller corpus.  I would be happy to proof for your venture, and can hope
to spot mechanical errors in the process.  (A typical rulebook might take
two weeks, allowing for checking of the rules.)  For this project, you can
have my services at a very nominal fee, rather than the $0.85/page I get for
reading bodice-rippers...

    Now on to my reactions to your posted ideas:

Yes.  I really think that the DGP task system was one of the best innovations
added to the basic CT rules, and I\'d be content if it was carried over intact
into the new game.  I would also _strongly_ (!!!) urge that you give due
consideration to the maintenance of continuity with existing campaigns by
carrying forward the basics of character generation.  I consider one of the
strengths of D&D to be the fact that everything from original D&D forward has
compatible character descriptions.  (Theirs tend to become more elaborate,
but Traveller has done that too.)  In other words--I think that changing to
a totally different rules system was a rotten idea, because it voided my
fifteen years of accumulated work.  (So I\'ve been planning on carrying on
with the old rules when I next start up.)

I think that an SF game needs a design system, and I spent a lot of time with
the MegaTraveller system, which I rather disliked.  (Still, I have an archive
of over 300 designs, all of which were posted to the Traveller mailing list,
and a number of which made it into published Traveller materials via Charles
Gannon.)  A usable system, to my mind, is one which does not require a
computer!  I\'m less worried about whether various real world items can be
recreated exactly, and even less worried about the fringes of the system
where it starts to break down.  It would be nice, though, if both of the
latter points were addressed in some sort of designer\'s notes, so that
everyone would realize from the outset that there are holes, and to have an
idea of where they are.  I don\'t think that higher detail helps--just inspires
more questions.  No one ever had a problems with Book 2 starship design, as
far as I could tell...

??? What is this?  Something other that the mailing lists?

If you could put out an archive disk of everything done to date, I\'d probably
buy a CD drive to use it.  Hypertext linkages among the material would be
fantastic.  I\'d love to be able to hand the players a "library data" disk
and let them sift for the clues...

Maybe.

Another maybe--I wrote a program to do trade with book 2 rules once, and
I guess I\'d use something to generate animal encounters tables and planetary
data, but I\'d rather not need a spreadsheet to design a vehicle.

Unless they were really good, I\'d sonner read Piper, Anderson, Doc Smith and
the other inspirations for the game.

Probably I\'d buy.  Not anything for the Virus era though.

Blech.  No offense, but I really think the card game market is supersaturated
at the moment.

I\'ve been builidng cardboard buildings recently, and it\'s an acquired taste.

Well, if it\'s to be an SF game, get the robots and the aliens out early, and
my personal opinion is that you can\'t have too much background data.

I can\'t do calculus with a calculator. But I CAN do calculus with a
stick and some dirt. In fact, I HAVE done calculus with a stick and dirt
(well, sand actually).

I don\'t think it\'s bollux to say that Tech-Level is not the same thing
as Knowledge-Level. In fact, it may be more closely related to something
that could be called "Industry-Level". Knowlege level varies from
individual to individual. But Tech-Level, as I understand it, describes
a culture\'s capabilities, not an individual\'s knowledge.

To put things crassly, TL says what a character is allowed to buy, at
the manufacturer\'s retail price, when he\'s on a particular world. (Maybe
it should be called "Shopping-Level" :) ) Obviously TL is nothing more
than a broad generalization; the referee has to decide all the
particulars, as always. So what else is new?

I guess the interesting issue is why you can\'t buy anything anywhere in
the Imperium. There could be dozens of reasons for any given shopping
restrictions (ie, TL) for classes of merchandise on a given world.
Reasons could be economic, industrial, political, military, educational,
astrographical, sociological, theological, or even sometimes (as the TL
tables themselves might suggest) historical.  I guess this particular
will have to be left to the referee as well.

Just for the record, the only innovations I\'ve liked since the demise of
"Classic" Traveller have been:
     1) MT personal combat--it finally made sense to be afraid if somebody
pointed a body pistol at you.  Far from perfect, but IMHO an improvement over
"Classic"
     2) Task system in general
     3) more detailled ship/vehicle design
     4) Hard Times--with MT, the TRAVELLER universe had begun to feel more
settled and certain.  What\'s the use of the scout service and ships\' sensors
when you can just pick up an atlas of the Imperium.  Hard Times made things
uncertain again, which was good.
** All the above refer to MT only.  I\'ve glanced at TNE, and I hate the virus
and think the game mechanics are way too involved.  Besides, I was
emotionally attached to using just D6\'s.

or was that somebody else\'s project?

5.  Wherever Traveller ends up, I think it will survive.  IMHO, it is
the only really good SF based gaming system around...

6.  Whoever picks up Traveller will be in a position to do
something I\'d really like to see..a divorce between the Traveller
game *system* and the Traveller game *history*.  Yes, yes I
know..so don\'t start flaming me!  <g> I realize that the detailed
history is what sets Traveller apart from everything else, so I\'m
not suggesting that we dump it.  Just that we sanction and
develop more than one!

What I\'d like to see is a general game system (that\'s what the
TNE rules were going to be, I think), and several Official
Histories.  Three that I can think of right now:  a. the Virus
collapsed history; b. the Rebellion induced Hard Times history; c.
the Classic Imperium where the Rebellion failed and no Virus was
ever released.  Maybe there could be other Histories that are
officially sanctioned and supported as well, but that are still
based on the Same System Of Rules.

Well that\'s my two cents anyway.

Eris Reddoch
----
I generally agree with Eris, except I\'d prefer some kind of threfold
division:  (1) TRAVELLER rules, (2) TRAVELLER setting, (3) TRAVELER history.
I liked the MT rules, but I liked the CT setting because it\'s so broad and
vague.  At the very beginning, there was a feeling that you could make it
almost any science-fiction setting you wanted.  As the years went on, and
library data piled up, the universe became much more certain and settled.  By
the time MT came out for example, you KNEW you wouldn\'t find Hivers running
around the Spinward Marches.  I felt I couldn\'t build my own planets or
subsectors, because I\'d be violating canon (even when I didn\'t have the
"canon" data).  Hard Times was a signifcant improvement because all of a
sudden, the universe was uncertain again and you could genuinely surprise
your players.

Yes, DGP is in negotiations with Marc Miller.

We are ecstatic that Marc has taken on the leadership of Traveller
once again, and we look forward to working with him and supporting
his efforts in any way we can.

I can\'t say any more than that at this time.

Though things are definitely looking up.

        And there was great rejoicing, and angel choruses rang out with
hallelujahs, and all people were glad ...

        OK, so maybe I\'m going a bit overboard. But to me, this is a small
consolation in the midst of great sadness. Keeping my fingers crossed ...

I accept most of what you have to say and agree with much of it.
However, I never said anything about equity or social justice. History has
shown that  the speed of development is often inversely related to equity of
distribution. In fact "Forced Saving" of one kind or another has been very
common in the development histories of many countries on Earth whether it is
imposed by an authoritarian regime or by the natural process of unregulated
free-market capitalism. History has shown that the speed of capital
accumulation and distribution equity are inversely related.

Mass starvation was a regular occurance in the history of the Soviet Union
and its cause was not just "extraordinary cold winters". Forced Saving - the
confiscation of food product to feed the workers in factories in towns and
cities in order to maintain production of manufactured goods - was the cause
of much starvation in rural areas. At the height of its development drive
the Soviet Union achieved (using comparable growth and development measures)
in 10 years what it had taken 60 years to achieve in the United States.
I don\'t believe in this kind of system but it makes my point that forced
sacrifice and saving are implicit in rapid development.

Having said all that, I accept that in many situations accumulated capital
would be channelled offworld and coreward as in the "enclave" type system
that some developing countries on Earth experienced. The more I think about
it, you are right in thinking that this sort of arrangement would be
widespread especially under the Imperium.

H&I wan neither more comprehensive nor better laid out than the Hiver Alien
Module from NE. It was, for the most part, merely a word for word copy with
snide remarks thrown in. what little was actually reworked (excluding
system mechanics stuff, including CGen) was LESS detailed, and less well
worded, IMNSHO. I wound up using my old CT module more than H&I.

As to someone else\'s comment about NE CGen vs CT/MT CGen:

I want to see the old system for 4 reasons:

1: It provides more detail about the character\'s hiostory (under Adv Gen),
something my players have always wanted/needed/used.

2: It is inherently faster than TNE, as there are fewer player decisions.

3: It produces more realistic, albeit more a problem with players,
characters; I have had TNE Characters doing in excess of 15d6 damage with a
non-critical punch.

4: It is easier for new players to assimilate. Many of my experienced
(decade or more) gamers had difficulty understanding, using, and working
with TNE. Nobody I know has had anywhere near the difficulties with CT/MT
in either basic or advanced generation.

5: I dislike TNE except for the streamlined task system. FF&S.

The Ithklur were mentioned in a passing (what, about a paragraph or so
of text) in the original Alien Module.  It did an excellent job of
relating everything from Hiver anatomy to history to thier current
position in TNE.  The character generation stuff fit in perfectly with
the stuff from the rulebook.

My guess is that the reason you despise it so is simply because of
it\'s nature as being a New Era product.  No, I take that back, I will
admit that many people may not have found any humor in the jokes that
were presented in the book.  But that still does not make it a poor
reference material.

Only for Army, Navy, Scout, and Merchant characters.  I find that
every character I\'ve ever created with the advanced system had similar
backgrounds.  I would rather just make it up myself.  Hmm, he\'s got
Zero-G skill as a merchant.  How about if he learned it while serving
on a TL 9 free trader?  You know stuff like that.  I find that
player\'s create an infinitely more interesting history than such
heavy-handed rules can.

Plus, in the old system, a character couldn\'t change careers.  That
never turned out to be too much of a problem with the basic character
generation, but it got to be impossible with the advanced character
generation.

: 2: It is inherently faster than TNE, as there are fewer player decisions.

As a roleplayer, I should probably be offended by the last remark.
Not for the time, but for that player crack.  Players like generating
quick characters, but they also like to have control over their
destinies.  As an aside, I created a character using the MT and TNE
rules.  A three term character who spent two terms as a scout and one
term as a merchant.  MT basic and TNE took about the same amount of
time (for MT I created both a three term scout and a two term/one term
scout/merchant).  This came out to about 12 minutes.  Not the quickest
character generation compared to some systems, but not the half-hour
most games expect you to put into creating a character.

Uhm, I think those are the combat rules that you have a real problem
with.  The way derived values like HTH damage and the like are handled
aren\'t really caused by the character creation rules so much as they\'re
affected by the combat rules.

The problem I see here is that you\'re saying it\'s hard for all the
old-time player who don\'t want to adapt to something new?  Or is it
something else?  I was the first to blast (and blast hard) at the
changes that were made between MT and TNE.  I though "house system,
bah!"  But I actually gave it a chance.  I found lots of things that I
liked.  Granted, I also found lots of things that I didn\'t like.

: 5: I dislike TNE except for the streamlined task system. FF&S.

Wil, I think what you really mean to say is that you dislike the TNE
storyline.  I will agree with you that FFS is a fantastic product!
And I will give kudos to the task system even though I liked MT\'s very
much.

post this announcment here.  They let us have this list for free, so one ad
in two years shouldn\'t offend any one :-)  Besides, some of this is of
interest to people on this list any way.

        Multi-Player Games Network would like to announce the availablity of
        its World Wide Web home page, and a new Windows95 based network --
        MPG-Net Showcase.

        The Web pages can be seen at:  http://www.mpgn.com
        Included at the site is a tour of the System Access Software, and all
        of the multi-player games that we currently have online.  You can also
        read reviews of our products as well.  You can create an account, and
        download the software to get started playing right away.  

        MPG-Net Showcase consists of the Win95 System Access Software (SAS)
        and Win95 frontends of our games.  The frontends are free to download
        from the web site.  All you need to play is machine capable of running
        Win95 (486/33 8mb RAM) and access to the Internet via Winsock.  A
        Pentium with 16 mb of RAM is suggested.

        The games that are currently on line include:
     
              * The Kingdom of Drakkar -- Fantasy Role Playing, quests, etc.
              * Empire Builder -- Based on the Mayfair Game, you and upto five
                others try to build a nation spanning rail-road system.
              * Minion Hunter -- Based on the GDW board game, which is based
                on Dark Conspiracy, you and upto five others work together to
                fend of the Dark Minions and their quest to take over the world.
              * Operation: Market-Garden -- Based on the GDW board game, you 
                command troops on either the Axis or Allied sides as you try
                your hand at the largest Airborne operation of WWII.
              * Imperium -- Based on the GDW board game, which is based on
                Traveller, you go head to head against another to control 
                space near Terra/Sol.

        So check out the web page, read about the games, and give MPG-Net 
        Showcase a spin!!!  You get five free hours to try it out.  After
        that, the rate is $2.00 US an hour to play. 

Wew, that was painless.  Any way, for you Imperium fans, we do have Imperium
on line.  Also, I will probably be starting up a Classic Traveller Online
game in 
the next few weeks.  I hope to use the web to distribute maps, text, and other
information, and MPG-Net Showcase\'s conference rooms to conduct the sessions.

Again sorry for the blatent commericalisam, but they are nice enough to give us
this list!!!

I did a 5x5x5 grid subsector map at one point.
That is, in my final analysis, the wrong size.
The primary "wrongness" is that you can jump past
the next subsector over in any direction with a
J-6 starship; that mandates 6x6x6 subsector maps.
I strongly suggest no larger; 6x6x6 with about 1/2"
hexes is as large as you can put on a 8.5x11 sheet
of paper without much in the way of other info.

Btw, the mapping convention I use within these
subsectors is a set of xy planes, and the hex numbering
is zxy.  Seems easiest to translate ("level-column-row").

I will make my prototype maps available if people want.

The next step up, sectors, domains etc., those are
interesting questions.  That depends on how masochistic
you are... I assumed that sectors were 2x2x2 subsectors
(8), because 3x3x3 is 27 and they\'re *big* subsectors,
216 hexes instead of 80.  2x2x2 keeps things more manageable
for smaller descriptions.  At existing "densities" per hex,
you\'d end up with 300-600 worlds per "sector" at 2x2x2;
3x3x3 would be 1000-2000.  Much less manageable.

Finally, as a note of caution, I do not suggest anyone
trying to retrofit 3D to the existing Traveller universe.
Works nice in a home-cooked campaign, but the Imperial
background translates very poorly.

	Which, of course, shouldn\'t be the case.  Considering that the 
average jump-6 capable ship is far more costly than the average jump-1 
capable ship, the shipper should be charging more based on his costs of 
doing business.  Besides, s/he could obviously get more for the service, 
since jump-6 is 6 times as fast as jump-1 (assuming you are shipping 
something 6 parsecs away).

Well, I have, actually ... through ex-students I keep in contact with and with
the younger members (90%) of the games club I am president of. And they have no

Yes, I may well be falling into that trap. But I probably didn\'t express the
"theory" in question very well, either ... the idea is that the kids I teach
now will be *forced* to change their jobs several times because the jobs that
they have will be rendered obsolete. This is, to me, dubious.

Let me give several examples -

1) When I started teaching 20 years ago, we were still using Gestetner (Roneo to
you NorAm types?) ink duplicators and Fordigraph spirit stencil duplicators, no
computers at all, videos (if available) on 1/2" reel-to-reel tapes, and the
like. Now? Well, computers are more common, videos are VHS types, and
Photocopiers have *completely* replaced all the previous duplicators. But, as
for the actual *job*, apart from the usual fad changes in regulatory
requirements (which, take it from me, are mostly given lip service while we get
on with what actually *works*) and administrivia, it\'s virtually identical (no,
I\'ll go further, it\'s *completely* identical). I see no developments that are
in line now or in the near future that will change the core job that I do.

And I\'d go as far as to say (as I did recently) that teaching will be pretty
much the same in the world of the Imperium, too. Lots of extra you-beaut *aids*
to make you more effective, but the core job will probably be the same.

2) One of my ex-students went into Nursing and she\'s doing quite well - and
intends to be a Nurse for the rest of her working life. Her mother\'s a nurse as
well and, though she made the point that she\'s had to adapt to many changes in
the thirty years she\'s been doing the job, she\'s still doing the same basic job
she did 30 years ago. Sure, the tech has changed, and made the job easier, but
the basic job is the same ... and she developed the skills to use all that new

I use the Preserve Maximum Linear Distance (PMLD)
assumption.  If you look at an (8x10) standard 2D subsector, then to
PMLD within the subsector (12.8 parsecs) then the nearest you can get
is a cube with 7 parsec sides.
 ----

I have a 3D hex based system. Odd numbers of hexes are bad for mapping 
because you need more than one type of map to represent them.

 ----
  Sectors are then cubes with four subsectors on a side
(inkeeping with PMLD), and Domains are cubes with two sectors on a
side.  If you take "standard" density as 40 worlds per subsector
(ie. 50% of 8x10 2D subsectors) then in 3D standard density is a 12%
chance of there being a world in a given cubic parsec.
 ----

Your sector is 4 times bigger and your domain is 2 times bigger.
I use a 6 parsec a side subsector.
Also I use an 8% (1 in 12; 11+ on 2d6) chance of a system.
A Sector is 3 subsectors a side, a Domain 2 sectors a side like yours.
It looks a bit sparse (18 systems in a subsector) but the number of 
subsectors in a sector and sectors in a domain quickly bring it up to the 
numbers we\'ve come to expect.

 ----
I\'ve even come up with a mapping grid - 2 x 4 boxes, 7 parsecs on a
side, with the eighth box containing the map legend.
 ----

I have a system that allows 3 layers to be represented on one 2D page.

It works by assuming that each hex has the vertex of 3 hexes above and below 
it over the centre of the hex.
Hexes are adjacent to 6 other hexes in the same plane, 3 above and 3 below.

The "above" information is printed at every second vertex of a hex and the 
"below" information on every alternate one.

This system is unfortunately NOT symetrical. There are two ways it can work.
Just like proteins etc... ;)

I have the convention that "above" is to the right and "below" is to the 
left.
ie. (A = above B= below C= centre)

     C
   \\   /
 C  A-B  C
   /   \\
 --B  C  A--
   \\   /
 C  A-B  C
   /   \\
     C

 ----
Is a distance of 1.4 parsecs jump-1 or jump-2?
 ----

Not a problem if you use my system. ;)

The existence of low-tech worlds within the Imperium is not necessarily
paradoxical - look at the spread of technology here on Terra.  I find it
important not to go down the line of saying that a world is TL5, therefore
everything on it is also TL5.  I\'m sure that the wealthy and the privileged
on lower tech planets will import higher tech items.  Off-world industrial
concerns or governments may well become involved in building
projects above the local TL.  Look at the involvement of the Soviet
Union in the building of the Aswan Dam.  These arrangements also
set up plenty of opportunities for adventure: political intrigues, bribery,
sabotage etc etc..  I regard TL as being an expression of the average
production capacity of a world.  Technology does not always even
out.  I am writing this on a sophisticated personal computer, and you
will be reading it via an enormous computer network.  A few thousand
miles away people are starving and have no access to clean water.

Many of the \'poorest\' (=lower tech) peripheral societies on earth are not
colonial properties of  the core states (at least, not physically...). It is
often not in the interest of a more technologically advanced state or
world to physically take over and administer a less advanced one. It
is far more profitable to maintain the technological differentiation, which
generally enables the more advanced state to import raw materials
and labour (or export dangerous/dirty production and waste) from the
less advanced state cheaply, and export sophisticated finished
technological products which are more expensive.

Historically, higher tech nations have, as you write, exploited those less
advanced than themselves, but they do not need to physically invade,
subjugate and garrison a planet to do it.  I find it quite convincing that
lower tech planets exist within the Imperium, and I am sure that most
higher tech planets would be pleased to keep them that way.

Besides, it allows players who harbour secret AD&D urges to whip out
their swords and fight the evil minions of King Zog and his army ;-)

There seems to be little impulse in the Imperium to direct or promote the
"development" of planets either technologicly or politicly.  That means that
having, through some circumstance or other arrived at a low technology, a
world is going to stay there unless it has something to offer the
interstellar community to encourage development (either because planetary
authorities want it or because  suits the corporations)

Look at the amazon basin.  Individuals have been leaving the Indian cultures
and returning to them since European colonization began, but the only reason
that the area is being dragged into the twentieth century is that the
dominant culture in the area wants the resources.  Otherwise, they would
have been left in the stone age.

Even if free traders visit a tech 4 world occasionally and trade machine gun
ammunition for dragon steaks, this is probably not going to make a change in
they way most people think, and so in the way they live, or the core technology.

About a year and a half ago Glenn Coffin quoted something out of Starship
Operator\'s manual about jumpspace. Unfortunately, I do not have that book 
nor can I find it so I would like to ask if anyone could look up some more
information in the book. 

1. What happens if the jump drive turns off in jump space? Will the strange
physics rip the ship apart instantly or will the crew have time to do
anything about it? 

2. If a ship manages to make the right rolls and engage the drive from on
planet, how much of the surrounding area will be drawn into jump space with 
the ship?

Hi,

I\'ve written a Traveller alien word generator for Windows 3.1 and above. It can
create Vilani, Aslan, Vargr, Droyne, and Zhodani words and save them to a file.
I\'m looking for a good place to upload this for Traveller players. I\'m fairly
novice at using the web and internet, so any help would be appreciated. Is there
anything special I need to know about uploading? Thanks in advance for any help.

 Joe, this seems pretty usable and well-thought out, at least at
 first glance.  You\'ve omitted something, though:

 Skill degradation.  Unless a person is one of those rare
 individuals with a near-eiditic memory, skills that aren\'t used
 will degrade.

 I\'d consider something like this (off the top of my head; probably
 needs tweaking):

 [NOTE: I\'m assuming the existence of a task system not dissimilar
 to the MT task system - translate as needed]

 If a skill isn\'t used at all within 180 game days, the character
 has effectively lost one level of that skill (never dropping below
 0).  However, if the skill is used as you describe above for an
 adventure upgrade within a year (of the beginning of the 180-day
 period), the "increase" back to the "original" skill level is done
 with an "easy" roll, _plus_ the increase _above_ the original
 skill level can be taken, but at one difficulty level higher than
 normal.  If the skill isn\'t used at all within a year, it is
 "permanently" lost, and can only be increased back to "normal"
 using your procedure unmodified.

Sure. The reason is that the *product* is still the same. The same goes
for the Nurse example, the plumber and the carpenter. As well as
doctors and lawyers. The "product" isn\'t going to change substantail,
nor are the "raw materials. The tools are improving. So are the
techniques (though *very* slowly in some fields).

Actually, scribes still exist. They just do *custom* work now. An
interesting example is a monastery in New Mexico of an order that was
long reknowned for the talents of its scribes. They now have people
designing web pages, and doing hand illuminated art to be scanned in as
part of them!

So I guess it is both the skills *and* the product.

The jump drive doesn\'t turn off prematurely, as the hull grid is =
superconducting. When jumping, you spend an awful lot of energy =

Making the jump to jump space includes creating a jump field bubble =
around the ship. That bubble normally extends approximately 1 meter from =
the ship, so I guess that a meter of the surrounding area will be drawn =
with the ship (not into jump space, but transported with the ship to =
it\'s new location).

What was the international law of salvage in the 18th Century?  That\'s where
your answer lies, I think.  Normally, a ship with nothing living on it
belonged to whoever found it (this was one reason for having a ship\'s dog,
or so my father says).  I don\'t know if this applied to a ship belonging to
the sovereign.

As a practical matter, because the ship is three hundred years old, the
Imperial Navy may no longer want it.  They (specifically Naval Intelligence
and the office of naval history) will probably want to debrief the ship --
backup the log, physically inspect the ship, inter and record any bodies
properly, etc. -- but they\'re not putting it back into service.   So perhaps
the opportunity to debrief will be sufficient consideration for the Navy to
let the players keep the ship.  After all, without the players, the Navy
would never have learned of the ship.  

Information is, in my view, the most important thing aboard that ship --
both formally recorded information like the log, and facts that can be
deduced from inspection and analysis.

>And what equipment would be aboard?

Gosh, what an opportunity for the referee to go totally nuts!  Now the
difference in equipment between Imperial 800 and 1100 is not nearly so great
as between 2000 A.D. and 1700 A.D., but still I think that I would use that
as a guide.  "Hey, check this out -- a _keyboard_ at the helm station,"
e.g., and plenty of "what did they use _this_ tool for?"  Surely there will
be some 300-year old viruses in the air ducts to give the PCs nasty colds or
worse.  There will be some odd, non-compatible equipment, like an 8.8 mm
pistol, or holocrystals that are the wrong size for readers.

Not exactly.  Each system has an independent mass and volume, the volume
having to be accomidated within the hull volume (more or less).  The
traveller "displacement tonnage" is the volume in m^3/14.  Traveller tonnage
is a measure of volume, not mass.

Although "tons" were used to evaluate the capacity of a standard hull to
contain components in the 1st edition black books, no means were provided to
translate from that measure to any other standard unit.  The first time I
saw 1 ton = 14 m^3 was in an ealy book of deck plans (traders and gunboats,
perhaps) where some standard has to be found for establishing volume, and so
the volume of one metric ton of hydrogen fuel was taken as a standard.  I am
not sure when actual mass was added to ship design (as opposed to other
systems covered in striker 1).  Was it part of Megatraveller, or did it come
in with FF&S?

Well, water is 1 tonnes per m^3.

Mass and volume are tracked seperately.

Why not? Take a 4,000 tonne destroyer and accelerate it at one G, and you
will be consuming about 200MW (if my calculations are not completely off)

remember that a starships weapons are also powered by the reactor.  If you
took the energy produced by, say, the main power plant on the Iowa, and
added the power produced by the powder charge when each gun fires, and the
power produced by the engine on each tomahawk, and -- you get the idea.

The the Iowa is operating at ranges measure in hundres of km, not tens of
thousands.

A ticondaroga\'s main engines (displacement 9,600 tons -- that\'s mass, not
volume) generates 80,000 shaft horsepower.  Now 80,000 hp is about 60MW
(although the definition of "shaft hp" might make the conversion a bit
different). The Kennedy class CV (82,000 tons displacement) generates
280,000 hp  - 208MW.

Remember, that\'s mot all electricity -- most of that power is produced and
used mechanically -- but its still power.

The Watt is a unit of power.  Use 1000 Watts for an hour, and you have
consumed one kiolwatt-hour of energy.  

Electricly, one watt = 1 volt * 1 amp.

According to Starship Oporators Manual (IIRC), the Jump Drive requires a
trickle charge during operation.  Cancel this charge and the Jump Bubble
integrity would fail and the ship would emerge from Jumpspace.  Where and
when, I don\'t know, but it can\'t be along the route and less than one week,
because this would mean a highly skilled Astrogator could perform minijumps
(ie from GG to MW) in less than a week.

About 1 meter from the hull, maybe 2-3m, but not more. Enough to make a

	From: "Steven Alexander" <salexander@dttus.com>

	Subject: Starship construction under different gaming systems....

Steven:
	[deletions...]     
     Also, another question related to CT/MT power plants...why do these 
     craft require so many MW of power???  IM not an educated 
     physicist-type as you can tell, but I know that approx. 515MW is equal 
     to about .1% of USA\'s annual power needs.  Some large MT warships use 

Me: (nitpicking ;) The megawatt (MW) is a unit of energy per unit time; it
is 1 million Joules per second. Power (in technical jargon) means energy
over time. So technically, one cannot talk of an annual POWER need; you
can only talk of an annual ENERGY need. This is the same thing as a
power need. (No "annual!")

Steven:
     to about .1% of USA\'s annual power needs.  Some large MT warships use 
     540 billion watts and some smaller 400 ton craft use almost 1 billion 
     watts!!!!  In 2300AD, some of the larger ships require 150 to 300 MW.  
     Realistically, does all this make sense??  I can understand that a 
     jump drive would require sufficient energy, but the other ship systems 
     shouldn\'t require more than 50 MW on even the largest 
     starships....help!!  How many MW of energy does an wet-navy aircraft 
     carrier, nuclear sub, or cruiser produce currently???
     
Me: (trying to be helpful this time 8^) Traveller starships, which
weigh thousands of tons and accellerate at tens of meters per
second-squared, use up tremendous amounts of power, much more than a wet
navy aircraft carrier which will rarely go faster than about 50 knots.

I\'m not a rocket scientist, but I do recall my freshman physics pretty
well, so I\'ll try to calculate the Power output of the engine of a
vessel massing 100 tons (M = 100,000 kg) and accellerating at 1 gee (a =
10 m/s^2). If I get it wrong, maybe one of our rocket scientists can
correct me! 8^) (Are you still out there, Steve Higginbotham or George
William Herbert?)

My calculation for the power plant output (in watts) is
relativisitically:

P = sqrt(F^2 * c^2 + R^2 * c^4)  -  R * c^2

where P is the power in watts; F = M*a = (100,000 kg)*(10m/s^2) is the
force of the starship\'s drive, in our case, one million Newtons (10^6
N); and c is the speed of light, c = 3 * 10^8 m/s. R is the rate of mass
ejected out of the ship\'s rocket, in kilograms per second.

If we use some sort of "field" drive, that is, if we use massless
particles for the rocket ejectiles, R equals zero and our formula
becomes:

P = F * c

So our 100 ton ship\'s power plant is rated at (10^6 N)*(3*10^8 m/s) =
3 * 10^14 W = 3*10^8 MW. That\'s 30 million megawatts!

If we use a more normal non-relativistic rocket with real mass shooting
out the back of it, we can simplify the equation to:

P = F^2 / (2 * R)

Here, the power you need depends on how much mass you shoot out the
back. If you use 100 kg/second, the power you need is 5 gigawatts.
That\'s five billion watts to us Americans, 5000 million to everyone
else.

If you use a thousand kilograms per second instead of a hundred, you
cut your power requirement by ten to 500 MW. Note, however, that
our one-hundred-thousand kilogram ship is unlikely to kick out
mass at one thousand kilograms per second for too very long!

Note also that this is for a perfect, 100% efficient rocket motor.  An
inefficient motor would need more power. So it seems to me that the
power plant outputs in Travller are unphysically low.

Steven:
     And also, over what time period does the reactor output this energy??? 
      Is this a per/kw hour type figure??  How many volts in 1 MW???
     
Me: This is related to the nit I picked in the first paragraph (which is
why I picked it! 8^) A megawatt, like a kilowatt (or even a lowly watt)
is a unit of energy over time. So our five hundred megawatt reactor
produces 500 million joules per second. A kilowatt-hour is equal to
(1000 Watts)*(3600 seconds) = 3.6 million joules. So our 500 MW is about
140 kilowatt-hours PER SECOND.

There are a million WATTS in 1 MW. The VOLT is not a measure of power.
So I guess the nearest possible answer to your question "How many volts
in 1 MW???" is: 120 in North America, 240 in Europe! 8^)

Just kidding! I\'m glad you asked; it\'s good to see that I\'m not the only
guy who wonders about this stuff!

Please E-mail me directly to get a copy of my derivation of the
above formulas.

The Belter character class I submitted today had some serious 
typographical errors in the assignment resolution tables.  Therefore, I 
am releasing this corrected version.  I am very sorry for any 
inconvenience this may cause.

By the way, the previously submitted Pirate character class also had some 
typographical errors (though none of a serious nature - just misspellings 
and such).  If you would like a copy of that posted/emailed, please let 
me know.  (As I type these things in, I am keeping a copy of them online, 
so if you need a copy of anything I have sent, let me know.)

                Belters: Mining in the Far Future

     It is felt by this author that the basic character of the
Belter does not do justice to the idea of a "space miner 49\'er".
So, the following system is set out for your perusal.  This is
intended to be used to create both NPCs and PCs, in conjunction
with GDW\'s Traveller rules system.

Choosing Associates

     In the Far Future, mining is done by three different groups:
Companies (which includes governments), Informal Groups, and
Individuals.  The amount of risk entailed varies inversely with
the number of people who are engaged in the task.  Woe betide the
poor person who decides to strike it out on his own.  However,
individual profits for any given strike also vary inversely with
the number of people involved, and thus directly with the amount
of risk (as with any investment).
     A beginning character may enlist in any of the different
types of organizations.  The required enlistment roll for
Company or Group prospecting represents the chance that the
character is accepted.  The enlistment roll for individuals is to
determine whether a patron is acquired.  A patron is necessary
for one-person expeditions in order to cover initial expenses.
The patron then gets a share of any profits.


Initial Activities

     Initial activities include the following:
     Characteristics:  Roll 2D for each of the six
characteristics and record the rolls on a sheet of paper.
     Age:  The character begins at age 18.


                       Beginning the Career

Enlistment:  Characters begin their career by jointing the Belter
organization of their choice.  They may either join a mining
corporation, a small group of individuals, or they may opt to go
it alone.  In each of these instances, the base enlistment roll is
different, but the die modifiers are the same.  These numbers are
given in the tables section of this article.
     Prospecting corporations are owned by their shareholders, the
government, or a combination of both.  On the other hand, informal
groups are a small to moderate sized group of individuals who have
joined together and pooled their resources in order to gain a

TL 11:  50,000 Cr/Kl

TL 12-13: 30,000 Cr/Kl
 
TL 14-16: 20,000 Cr/Kl

Computers are amazingly overpriced: Try

Price modifiers:

TL 5 x 1000

TL 6-7 x 100

TL 8 x 10

TL 9 x 5

TL 10 x 2

Computer    Price

0           3,000 Cr
0/fib       5,000 Cr
0/bis       5,000 Cr

1          20,000 Cr
1/fib      30,000 Cr
1/bis      30,000 Cr

2          40,000 Cr
2/fib      50,000 Cr
2/bis      50,000 Cr

3/fib      70,000 Cr

4          80,000 Cr
4/fib      90,000 Cr

5         100,000 Cr
5/fib     110,000 Cr

6         120,000 Cr
 etc...

Finally, lower the cost of the Low Power Hi-Grav plates  		

TL 10: 25,000 Cr

TL 12: 15,000 Cr

TL 13: 10,000 Cr


I\'ve played around with these and they produce much more reasonable 
results than the existing system.

I also reduce the volume and mass of all computers:

TL 9 x 0.5

TL 10 x 0.2

TL 11 x 0.05

TL 12 x 0.02

TL 13 + x 0.01

                         Pirates of Space

     In Traveller, Pirates play a big part in everyday space life.
The Imperium and the other governments are always on the lookout
for this, the scourge of space.  The pirates are
outlaws who have taken to attacking and plundering honest ships,
most especially traders.  As trade is the lifeblood of all
governments throughout space, pirates tend to be the most hated of
all criminals.
     It is rare, however, that a pirate will attack government-
owned ships.  Nor will they routinely attack ships bearing the
insignia of one of the Mega Corporations.  Both of these
activities are much too risky for the average pirate.
     Pirates generally focus the thrust of their activities on
free traders and small merchant companies.  These ships yield the
best profit to risk ratio.
     This article deals with creating a character who is a member
of this "underground" organization.  It presents a step-by-step
process of fleshing out a complete Pirate character in the
tradition of Mercenary, High Guard and Scouts (q.v.).


                    Character Creation Process

     First, create the basic Traveller character by throwing 2D
for each of the six characteristics (Strength, Dexterity,
Endurance, Intelligence, Education and Social Standing), noting
the scores on a sheet of paper.
     The second step is to make the enlistment throw.  A throw of
7+ is required, with a +1 DM for a Social Standing score of 7- and
a +2 DM for Endurance 9+.
     Next, determine the type of organization the character is
joining.  Roll 2D6: two through five results in a Solitary Ship
Group, meaning that it is a relatively small organization, with
only one ship, probably hovering near one major world in a system;
six through nine results in the character being part of a small
group of ships, probably preying only on those who venture into
its\' two-or three-parsec territory; ten through twelve results in
being accepted into an Organized Crime ring, which may be as big
as a subsector, a sector, or even larger.  Whichever organization
is determined is used for the entire career.
     Fourth, determine where the character is stationed.  A roll
(1D) of one through five results in the character being on a ship
for the term.  A roll of six means the character has been caught,
and will spend the term in Prison, thereafter being mustered out
of the Pirates.  Stationing is only rolled at the beginning of
each term.
     During each year of the term, rolls will be made on the
appropriate assignment determination table.  Once the assignment

The ship will be brought up before a court who will determine its status
(salvage or rescue) based on the circumstances. Basically it was salvage
if there were no _crewmember_ (or other representative of the owner) aboard,
otherwise it was rescue. The difference lay in how big a percentage of the
value of ship and cargo the salvagers/rescuers were awarded. I don\'t know
the specifics, but with salvage the owner might easily be forced to sell
the ship to cover the award.

Organizations don\'t work that way. If anyone can establish title to the
ship they\'ll pay what the law requires of them and not a credit more.
The best the PCs can expect above that is some goodwill.

Actually, WTH is (or rather was) a GDW product for TNE.  It was at

Just a couple of thoughts I would like to pass around.  You know, things I
thought you should know kinda stuff.

First, we will probably be moving the mailing list from our offices in New
York to our offices in Key West.  This could happen as early as today.  For
you, it should be pretty transparent.  We are going to switch to majordomo
as part of the change.  We will probably alias listproc to go to the right
place for subscribe/signoff commands.  Certain commands such as SET MAIL ACK
and stuff
wont work.  You will still use traveller@mpgn.com and xboat@mpgn.com to
communicate with the list.

Because of this, and the fact that we are busy with all these equipment
moves, I have not processed any address changes or other administrative
requests in several days.  I will probably clean these up during the
transition between servers.

With regards to what to do with the lists.  Alot of what to do with the list
depends on what actually comes out of the new Traveller system and the
reason for Xboat in the first place.

Regardless, "Traveller" will be to discuss the game in all forms, and will
naturally discuss the current shipping products.  Call it evolution, or what
ever.  Thats the purpose of the list, and that is not going to change.

Xboat was created for the refugees from Classic Traveller that felt that the
current Traveller was not for them.  If the new Traveller brings the Classic
Traveller\'s back into the mainstream, then Xboat\'s mission is less
important.  Probably though, the TNE exiles will need a home.  Xboat\'s
charter could be changed, but I would be inclined to leave Xboat alone, and

It was made by FASA back in 1982 and plays somewhat like GWs BloodBowl.  The
miniatures provided with the game were only 15mm so the game isn\'t nearly as
nice to look at compared to BloodBowl (but it didn\'t cost as much either).

Game play alternates between (human) players, beginning with the (G-Ball) player
in possession of the ball.  Each G-Ball player is assigned a postion (forwards,
halfbacks, fullbacks, and a goalie) and has a number of action points (similar
to SnapShot).  Actions include movement, reorientation, passing, shooting,
checking, striking, etc.  Scoring and blocking depend quite abit on the armour
worn by each player (according to his position).  Players can be disorientated,
stunned, or incapacitated by sucessful strikes or if hit by the ball (either by
accident or on purpose), although illegal actions may result in penalties
(entering and exiting the "field" just like Eric Lindros).  Rules for rebounding
shots are included, as well as automated rules for an equally automated (ie:
robotic) referee.

Its just lying around my basement but if you want it, give me an offer....

I assume that the ancestral Vilani were modern humans, Homo Sapiens. I,ve

Here are the issues that the transplantation raises:

            development of the Vilani?  For example, do they have any ancient
            tradition that states that Vland is not really their home?  Do they
            have any religious tradition that refers to the Ancients?

        2.  How did the Vilani react upon encountering the Terrans and
            presumably getting incontravertable evidence that Vland wasn\'t their
            original home?

        3.  In my campaigns I rule that alien plants and animals (if these
terms             can properly apply to alien life) are inedible to humans.
If this
            rule applies in general then the Ancients must have also
transplanted a large subset of the terran biota to Vland in order to
recreate the complex interactions of the terrestrial ecology.  This
            does not imply carrying actual biological samples: at TL20 I\'m sure
            the Ancients could simply carry an electronic record of plant and
            animal DNA to their project site at Vland and regenerate examples
            at will.  Global terraforming is listed at TL16 in TNE: kids\' stuff
            for the Ancients.

        4.  By TL4, Vilani biologists would be getting confused about how life
            developed.  Without a fossil record they might conclude that species
            do not develop with time.  By TL6 the problem would be compounded by
            the discovery that some species are genetically related: how can
this be if they do not share a common ancestor?

        5.  By TL10 the discovery of other (minor) humans races would cause
            even more confusion.

Obviously, the same questions apply to Zhodane and the Vargr homeworld.  

I know its not a vital roleplaying issue, but its fun to think about! Does
anyone else have any thoughts on the subject?

  The first two questions are very closely related here. A number of
well argued subjects are listed in the FAQ at
http://www.spirit.com.au/~jamesd/tml-faq.html. You could also add to this
collection any TNE/MT/CT/NT is better than TNE/MT/CT/NT sort of statement.

  The latest with NT (or T4) is that it is still scheduled for release at
Gencon (August), or at least as far as I have heard.

  Hope that helps.

Current sea-law also states that a major component of salvage/rescue is
the assistance rendered.   If you (in the distressed vessel) throw the
assisting vessel a line, that\'s rescue.   If you accept a line thrown
aboard from the assisting vessel, that\'s salvage, and the stakes change.

>everyone expects the world (should that be "the universe"?) from him. Good
luck,
>Marc.
>
>          ii. Rules
>
>CT/MT vs TNE is a BIG debate - it suggests that MM tread carefully and test the
>water more. Having both simple and expanded Char Gen seems to be the way to go,
>including more than the original 4 careers and possibly an aliens section. Task
>Resolution is wanted, but type is undecided. Simpler combat than TNE appears
>favoured. Expand world profiles, especially LawLvl and TL.
>
>          iii. Design Rules
>
>FF&S "Lite" (suggested first by M but named by J) seems to be a real winner -
>both GearHeads and NGH\'s want this one. Many people liked FF&S (was this the
>most populer TNE item? -- it seems so!), and most want to see it again. General
>consensus is for a re-write, many wanting it to mesh better with Traveller\'s
>background (many called to look at the GDW-Beta list for ideas AND for
>computerised design sequences - especially as part of a CD-ROM). Many want BL
>and BR kept, and asked for conversion rules.
>
>          iv. Backgrounds, Books and Magazines
>
>CT/MT vs TNE is STILL a big debate, evenly split, BUT multiple eras gets a big
>thumbs-up. As for books it is a scattered reply, with "Aliens - Give Us
>Anything!" and an Imperium Soucebook being the two front-runners.
>
>          v. CD-ROM Discussion, Traveller on the Net
>
>Many approved of the concept, but are undecided on the contents! World Gen,
>Craft Design, Library Data, and an Atlas are the most favoured. Net Traveller
>is favoured to garner interest in the product, more than as a serious full-on
>venture.
>
>          vi. Marketing stuff, Other
>
>Luke-warm responses to the marketing ideas, maybe just because it is very low
>on everyone\'s agenda.
>
>P.S. This is NOT my normal Net address!! I\'m using pine and a 1200-baud modem,

Message-ID: <316EB8BE@missgate2.sunderland.ac.uk>


Hi folks

I\'m writing a scenario (that I expect will turn into a
campaign) set on the world of Arden in the
Spinward Marches.

I would like to try and keep this material within the
existing canon as far as possible.  I have consulted
all the sources that I have at my disposal (Spinward
Marches, Library data, Regency Sourcebook)
that at least cover the area.  I was wondering if any
of you knew of any information relating specifically
to Arden that exists outside of these?  I\'m referring
to anything from scenarios to snippets of information
about names of cities etc. (pref. 1110 or earlier)

If you know of anything I\'d be grateful if you could
e-mail me with the name of the publication so I can
try and track it down (or if it\'s only a little bit of info,
perhaps you could just let me know what it is...)
Thanks a lot.

By the way, in all the discussion about new lists and
names for the new incarnation of Traveller, and in the
light of the ongoing CT/TNE schism,  I\'m surprised
that nobody\'s mentioned:

Traveller 4: The Empire Strikes Back ....
;-)

Cheers

Iain

The following is very paraphrased and occasionally quoted from DGP\'s 
Vilani & Vargr, about the only big source of info on the Vilani.

The early civilization of the Vilani was not only shaped by, but 
defined by the transplant to Vland.  

"While our homeworld of Vland was quite hospitable, we were not from 
this world, making it difficult to digest and metabolize Vland\'s 
proteins, sugars, and amino acids."

The early Vilani culture was shaped by the Ancients who taught the 
Shiguli how to process food for consumption by humans.  

"The Shiguli ultimately developed hundreds of "mystical" food conversion 
techniques, and became looked upon more as a shaman than as a cook." 
 
The Shiguli, along with the inevitable aristocrat, would make a 
pretty good ruling class.

Early Vilani culture, and in particular their less than trusting 
views of technological advances for its own sake were also shaped by 
the Ancients.

"Several of our legends tell of explorers finding great living 
stone-metal gods with enormous magical powers."

The gods were large war machines that were leftovers of the Final 
War.  They pretty much kept the Vilani humans hiding in the hills 
until they wore down.  Indeed, early civilization revolved around the 
discovery of these machines.    

I\'d bet they had a big effect.  Certainly they had a lot of effects 
on them culturally.

Remember there was a large span of time between these two events.  
The Terrans stumbled across the Vilani Empire in -2422 I.E.  The 
SolomanI Hypothesis (which theorized Terra/Sol, as the origin world 
of all humans) did not occur until 114 I.E.  Probably didn\'t have 
quite the effect it would have had if the 2 events were concurrent, 
especially since both branches were being effectively ruled by the 
Syleans at the time.  Later, when the Solomani became more militant, 
I\'m sure it played a big part.

If you\'re to believe "canon", the Ancients just taught them how to 
adapt the native life...  See the Shiguli comments above.

It\'d be a good adventure idea just to see how it would play out.  I 
agree here.

I agree.  The best part of Traveller is the fact that it has such a 
wonderfully fleshed out background.  Makes it possible to ponder such 
ideas.

Try Second Games Galore on 01234-823873. He doesn\'t have a copy in stock at 
the moment (I went through his stock pretty thoroughly on Sunday), but he 
has a fairly good turnover, so I\'m sure one is bound to turn up.

The other thing he does is he runs a club (Gamer\'s Discount Club), where you 
get 10% off his prices, you get first dibs on stock that comes in (most of 
the rare stuff doesn\'t even make it on to the mailing list!), and he has a 
gamesearch facility, where you tell him what your looking for, he puts the 
word around and if he finds it, he offers it to you first. The subscription 
is something like 15 pounds a year.

Good luck with your search.

Hm. I keep hearing murmurings about there being giant dead robot warmachines
littered over the surface of vland. Presumably they have some sort
of tradition built around this...

The "incontrovertable" evidence was not even presented as a hypotheses until
the Third Imperium I believe... the Haut-Devroe Hypothesis I think it\'s called.
Since the Vilani had discovered human races before, there was no reason to think
(from their point of view) that Terrans were any different.

Again, I think that basically, most life on Vland _is inedible_ to the Vilani.
They must go through an elaborate purification process to make the food edible.
This "food producer" caste rose to hold great power in Vilani society.
(There\'s a Vilani term for them... Shughsisi ?? I have no idea)

The Vilani took little interest in such matters, focusing on commerce and empire-building.
Basic science took very little of their collective interest.

> Obviously, the same questions apply to Zhodane and the Vargr homeworld.  

Zhdant (Zhodane ?) is a much "milder" case - it seems much more like a world
where humans might have evolved. Also, a lot of Zhdant is, again, Ancient ruins,
which sort of muddles questions that involve pre-history.

THere isn\'t much written about the Vargr homeworld Lair, except that it holds
little if any space in the hearts of Vargr as being special.

Basically, almost everyone simply ignores these problems! To us Terrans, it seems
like a big deal, but things like paleontology are actually a worthwhile pursuit
here on Earth - imagine the first Vilani paleontologist. _Frustrating_! Besides,
if you think Terran scientists are unappreciated, Vilani culture apparently values
them even lower...

(How do I know this? I\'m not sure... Gotta start keeping my Trav books here at work...)

 I fully intend to continue the concept, though almost certainly
 under a different, milieu-appropriate name.  I will emphasize,
 though, that I am _not_ the only one allowed to write these
 things; in fact, I encourage others to follow the format and write
 their own - Traveller in any incarnation is nobody\'s private
 stomping ground; we can all share in all of what\'s there, and we
 can all add to it.

 What we write today can be tomorrow\'s Traveller Library Data
 Network On-line.  Isn\'t a shared universe a nifty concept?

Continuing with Joe\'s "first time I laid eyes on it" thread:

Pretty boring for us:  we stated playing Starfleet Wars at school at 
lunch.  Then a friend of mine brought in Traveller and we started 
playing that.  Yes we were young and foolish (one of my favorite things
to do was to go to planets which had just achieved nuclear power and
blast them from orbit.  Doning Vacc Suits I would decend to the planet\'s 
now radioactive surface and relieve it of its precious metals........
ah young, foolish, and not knowing any better.)  From this humble beginning
we proceded to get more into the spirit of Traveller--to the point where
we looked with distain upon my friend\'s little sister\'s adventure (she so
wanted to play) which consisted of wave after wave of nasties until
finally all the PC were dead and which point she said "I won".

In the end however we finally worked out how role playing was supposed
to work and despite our shakey start I have been enjoying Traveller 
ever since.  Its been only one of two games I\'ve ever played seriously.
(I was glad to see in Joe\'s post that I and my high school friend were
not the only people who enjoyed TSR\'s GAMMA WORLD.)

So that\'s it....pretty dull....We have had our moments though.  Chad,
if your out there, I will never forget, "Your ship shudders and goes
off coarse......but you don\'t notice it."........

pages of an old-style TML or XTML digest.  This usually appears somewhere 
near the bottom of the latest digest, but before the last "real" post.

What gives?

	I have tried to find a complete list of Traveller items by GDW on 
the \'net, but have been unsuccessful.  So, I made an attempt on my own.  
I do not yet own all the items listed, nor do I own all editions of each 
item (ie, High Guard had two editions).  So, this list is incomplete.
	If there already is such a list in existence, please point me to it.
	If not, please help me by telling me of items that are not listed 
- - including earlier/later editions of products that are listed.

Thanks,

Heck yes! <g>  

It would be hard to do it on a mailing list though. <g>

I\'m particularly interested in how ya\'ll are going to handle system
and planetary generation in T4. H ave ya\'ll picked up on the
abbreviations NT and T4? <g>

What you should do is set up an interview on the Internet Relay Chat
(IRC).  It\'s easy to do and doesn\'t cost anything.  All you have to do
is set up an IRC client on your system, announce a time and channel
name on the list, and show up!  In fact, I\'m sure some of our number
could help ya\'ll do it if needed.

	Hmmm.  As I recall, that adventure was included from the very 
first edition of my list.  Oh, well.  Here\'s the list as it exists, for 
those of you still working from old copies . . . (it\'s now alphabetical

A Note on Magazines:  While additional issues of many listed magazines 
(i.e., Travellers\' Digest, JTAS (as Challenge), etc.) were produced, 
they are not included here because those issues contained material related
to games other than Classic Traveller, even though they did contain some 
material usable in the Classic Traveller system.  This is also the reason 
certain issues of Space Gamer, Dragon Magazine, and others are not listed.

As always, any additions or corrections will be appreciated.  Just email 
them to me (ransom@iconnect.net) or the list\'s co-author, thorinn@aol.com.

SUBJECT : Acronyms etc.

While we\'re on the subject of acronyms and abbreviations (I
enjoyed the challenge when first on x-boat of working out
what they meant from context etc.), can anyone clear up the
names of the MT Alien books?

It took me a while to figure out that \'Rats and Cats\' was the
Solomani and Aslan book but light finally dawned and I was
most amused (at my own blindness mostly!).  Cats is obvious
and I *assume* that Rats is because the Solomani are such
a nasty lot!  (If there\'s another derivation, I\'d love to
hear it.)

However, I have now seen both \'Bogs and Dogs\' and \'Cogs and
Dogs\' for the Vilani/Vargr book.  Is one a mistake or are
both \'in use\'?  Dogs again is obvious but I\'d be interested
to know why bogs or cogs (though I have sneaking suspicions!)

Definately worth including them in the FAQ.

     Now that we all know about the new Traveller (Traveller \'96, haha), 
     how do you all think FF&S will hold up in this new system??  Will FF&S 
     be incompatible or need some tweaking??  I have so far found FF&S a 
     good resource when creating other Sci-Fi genres and am curious as to 
     what you all might think of this book.

I checked out the web page.  It looks like there\'ll be a lot of interesting
information there when it gets put up :)

Definitely, and there\'s a few ways you could do it.

Let us mail in questions to ask and then post the complete interview here.

Hook up an IRC Client to your web page

Use a private channel on an IRC network like DALNet or Undernet, etc.

I\'d love to see this happen.

I\'ve been wondering about some of the Base Codes for the Dark Nebula =

The T, R and U codes are easy, as they are Aslan bases. The book says so =
on page 88. But what about the codes F, J and M? I can\'t find anything =
about them in that book.

I suppose them to be "combined naval base and \'scout\' station" (F), =
"naval base" (J) and "\'scout\' station" (M), but I\'d like to be sure. One =
strange thing is that they occur both on the Solomani worlds and the =
non-aligned ones.

Any ideas anyone?

A little while back I asked about \'Memory Alpha\' and got no

still not certain if it is GDW or Group One.

Can anyone tell me *anything* about \'Memory Alpha\'??  (Even

I can top that.  I bought up all the rest of the hardcovers (all 4,986 
copies) at $35 each.  But, since I\'m a kind and generous person, I\'ll be 
making them available for only $75 each.  Order yours today. :P

Just kidding, of course (as if I have $174,510 just laying around :-).  I 
/did/ buy two copies, though.  One to keep and one to use.  Heck, $35 for a 
hardbound copy, signed by Marc Miller, sounds good to me. :)

Golden\'s, etc.). 

TO KEN:  An interview with MM or any of the rest of the IG staff would be
great!  I don\'t care if it\'s an email interview or IRC (I see advantages
to both).  I read the transcript of the the interview done on AOL and
found it a bit choatic before they went into Protocol mode, so I think a
"we all mail in questions and get responses the next day" email setup
would be fine.

Are you sure you\'re not thinking of "metamorphosis Alpha"? That was a game
put out by TSR a little bit before my time. Something about large colony
ship where systesm had partially filled, and it became this big space ark

Well for my two penneth worth I\'d hope the combat system went back to 
Snapshot/Striker, you could pick those rules and run them almost 
without reading them, that was their beauty, they were relatively 
simplistic, FF & S just didn\'t do it for me, sorry. I would hope that 
this has been realised and retro-grouches like myself will prevail.
Best wishes for a simple life

We tend to treat it as Military Equipment (restricted at Lawlevel 3, I think).

Frankly, this is what you\'ll end up with anyway.  Neither the populations 
of Xboat or TNE will be able to stop themselves from speculating, 
which they will do in a vaccuum.

I vote for option 5 (one list), but I could not bear the resulting canon/
mechanics fights for the "one true way".  And certainly, at this point,

The Ancients wiped each other out 300,000 years ago.  Therefore the Vilani
were taken from Earth over 300,000 years ago.  See also Vilani & Vargr at 2
("Most archaeologists believe that our ancestors on Vland [were] human stock
from the planet Terra, brought to Vland by the Ancients some 300,000 years

Assuming (without looking at my MTJ4) that the mass is in tons and the
displacement in cubic meters, I\'d guess that 201 is a typo for "20".  I
would figure that a med bay would be somewhat less dense than water, by the
time you leave space to move around....

Hi All.
Unlike other principled people on this list, I have no problem wearing 
shirts that advertise things (I\'m wearing a Molson Export shirt as I 
write this :-).  I would _definately_ buy and wear a Traveller T-shirt so 
long as the design was reasonably cool.  Both the designs suggested so far 
sound good to me.  I like tube-o\'-ships concept, too.

Well, Marc himself has already responded, albeit briefly.  I own a copy 
of Memory Alpha, from back when it was offered free for a SASE from GDW.
Unfortunately, it\'s in transit with many of my other files from Virginia
to Texas.  Ask me again in a few weeks.  :-)

It was a mystery adventure involving memory alteration: it began when a
group of characters accepted a job and payment, with the proviso that,
afterwards, their memories of the job would be erased.  It then jumped
forward (as did the characters\' memories, of course) to the post-job
pay-off, and then chronicled their efforts to find the clues they\'d
left themselves about what the job _really_ entailed.

I shan\'t post spoilers, lest anyone want to play the adventure through.

about Galactic 2.0 (ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/doc/games/roleplay/

The main purpose of this will be to increase the number of world-
descriptions included with the program, though I\'ll probably take
the opportunity to work a bit on the program as well. A few of you
have already given me permission to include your world write-ups:

     Michael Bailey    Emerald, Jewell, Pequan, Ruby
     Doug Berry        Capon
     Lewis Roberts     Gerome, Lewis
     Jeff Zeitlin      Glisten, Nutema

   (If anybody knows the current addresses of Alvin Plummer
   or Christopher Griffen, please drop me note)

I figure that many of you silent-types out there must have
written-up other worlds within the Spinward Marches and other
sectors. If so, please send me what you\'ve done, assuming you\'d
like to see your work included with the next upgrade.

For those of you who are interested in working on a variant
Traveller-setting, I\'ve been putting together a history to go
with the "Variant 1" galaxy that was included with Galactic 2.0.
Email me if you\'re interested. At this point, I\'m basically
looking for comments as well as world descriptions.

Also, for those of you who are interested in getting involved
with a group of people who are hashing-out a non-Traveller SF-RPG
setting situated only a few decades into the future where Earth
has been contacted by members of an alien civilization (and things
didn\'t quite go as planned for either side), let me know. We\'ve
been toying with this for around a year now, and there\'s still a
long way to go. Nonetheless, I can send you the game\'s tentative
premise if you\'re interested in checking it out and perhap
offering comments (or even contributing to the project once we get
better organized).

If I remember correctly, Memory Alpha was a module for Gary Gygax\'s Cyborg 
Commando game (but I can\'t remember who the publisher was). I did see a copy 
of Cyborg Commando once at my games club, when I still lived in Glasgow, and 
I don\'t remember being very impressed at all.

If you\'re still desperate to own a copy, you could try Second Games Galore 
on 01234 823873 (from outside the UK the number is: +44 1234 823873), but I 
don\'t recall seeing Cyborg Commando in his stock last time I looked.

I think the CT double adventure Divine Intervention has sonic stunners
as PC special equipment.  I\'m suprised these didn\'t make it into MT,
as almost every other piece of postulated equipment has.

Subject: Weapons of Non-Leathal Intent
Message-ID: <9604191641.AA01778@khan.avalon.COM>



Weapons of Non-Leathal Intent (WNLI) are the big topic of discussion in several 
UN subcommittees right now.  The US DOD, Russia and the British MOD have done a 
lot of interesting research into it, and come up with some very Buck-Rodgers 
ideas, including Focussed-Concussion Explosives, Tasers, incapacitiating riot 
control gasses, stcky foam, dowel guns and sonic projectors.  However, each one 
of these weapons has been a miserable failure from a purely economic view; the 
cost of the weapons and manpower to incapacitiate one person with WNLI is at 
least ten times greater than with standard weapons.  In addition, each of the 
methods come up with thus far have very limited applications; they can either 
be easily blocked/avoided, or easily defended against.  The WNLI that are more 
effective at avoiding these defenses tend to be much more drastic and more 
potentially leathal.

I would suspect that Traveller has less WNLI due to the wargame background, but 
also because a WNLI that effects a human would effect aliens very differently; 
aliens might be unaffected by a concussion wave, or might die when exposed to a 
gas that incapacitates humans.  It would seem very unlikely that there would be 
one thing  (beyond plain old kinetic energy) that would effect all races 
equally, from either a WNLI or Leathal Weapon viewpoint.

Some interesting things to look for:
1)  Sonics.  There seems to be a lot of potential here.  Police and Military 
have had major success with a very simple Sonic WNLI, the Flash-Bang Concussion 
grenade.  There are some new experimental flash-bang rifle rounds soon to be 
produced, and the actual grenade continues to be improved (but remains quite 
dangerous to bystanders).  In the future, you might see major improvements in 
some of the experiemental crowd-control sound projectors used in China and 
Russia; imagine a hand-held weapon that immediately stuns an opponent, or fills 
the opponent with dread and terror.  In Traveller, I have always included

I don\'t have world descriptions for you... but I do have some comments.....

I\'ve written some traveller related programs too.... and your program is the

more amazing since it\'s written in the easiest language ever designed!  I
hope you don\'t mind, but I\'m looking into some new wrinkles that you might
like and I\'ll send you the source code when it\'s finished ( I refuse to
distribute it since it\'s "your baby" ).  I just wanted to let you know that
your work is appreciated ... especially since your program is written in such
a way that it almost screams for input from anyone that see it... THAT\'S the

I\'m posting my question directly to you..and a copy to the list.

There are "GEAR-HEADS" who are very concerned about equipment, ships,
and weapons, and then there are "SYSTEM-BUILDERS" like me.

So, tell us about Star System Generation, both basic and extended.
Will there be any changes in the algorithms used to develop and
describe stars and planets, if so what are they, will the RULES book
contain detail up to WORLD BUILDERS level (if not which book will),
and will you release software (or contract it out) to help develop
complete systems?

Some further comments:

1. The UWP is a good shorthand method of describing a planet,
   but *not* a system.  Consider expanding, or supplementing, it
   to contain data on the entire system.
   
2. I know you don\'t have the rights to 2300AD, but there were
   some ideas in there that are an advance on classic Trav when
   it comes to describing planets, ex. inner/outer planet types,
   core type, density, more extensive descriptions of
   atmospheres, etc.  You probably can\'t *use* that material, but
   you could draw on it.
    
3. T4, and Milieu 0 in particular, is going to depend on GM\'s
   doing *lots* of system generation..if I understand your plans
   correctly..so *please* put a lot of effort into this area
   right up front.

The problem is that jump 1 trade is presented as the least profitable
leavings left after the big shiping companies have gobbled up the
more profitable trade.  The reality is that using a jump-6 ship
increases your costs and decreases your revenue and is the least
profitable trade.  If a big corp is going to monopolize anything,
it\'s going to be jump 1.

I don\'t have a cite handy, but a few comments on flash-bangs (which are 
indeed widely used in counterterrorist warfare at TL8):

1.  They *do* work, and work well.
2.  They can set fires (though this effect, if considered undesirable, could
     be eliminated at higher tech levels).
3.  Their effectiveness is apparently based on a *combination* of the light
     and sound effects; either one alone is not anywhere near as effective.
4.  I seem to recall that the *timing* of the flash and bang is important,
     and calibrated to the human nervous system.  This is the part I\'m least
     certain about, but if true it has implications for use against Traveller
     aliens.

I placed an order for this on Monday, May 20th.  I bought two copies 
and was told at that time that my credit card would not be billed 
until July, and that the books would be shipped in August 
(around the time the books are released at GenCon).

   That would be mine.  I still have the responses (around 90 of them)
sitting on my desk, waiting to be recounted and turned into data.  The
final results should be ready before June 6th.

   Preliminary findings:

   The split between CT/MT and TNE players was about 60-40 in favor
of TNE.  Many of you have modified (to varying degrees) the rules set,
regardless of what basis you use for game mechanics.

   The most popular setting by far is the Spinward Marches, with the
Solomani Rim finishing a distant second.  So many people use the
Spinward Marches (CTers, MTers, TNEers) I\'m surprised that GDW even
considered releasing the Reformation Coalition material first when they
developed TNE.  Without question (IMHO) TNE was not an attempt to
``appease current players`` as at least one person has suggested, but it
was an attempt to bring in new players to the game (an attempt  that
was not as successful as perhaps it should have been).

   The most surprising result was the answer to the question regarding
whether or not people were considering the purchase of the new
Traveller.  My theory going into this exercise is that there would be a
small group of people who had been around Traveller for a while, who
were still die hard fans of the game, but had had enough, and while
they still planned on playing some version of it, it would be T4.  If that
group does exist, they didn\'t respond to my survey.  The overwhelming
majority of you plan on buying at least some of the new IG\'s Traveller
products, and many of you plan on buying all of them sight unseen.
While there was a significant percentage of you that still want to see
more before you will consider a purchase, *no one* ruled it completely
out.

   As for the date the respondents said they started playing Traveller,
most of you said that you started playing in the early 80s (for some
reason the year 1982 was very popular--what was released that year
Traveller-wise?).  Significant was the drop off of new players after
1985-86.  Apparently MegaTraveller brought very few new players into
the game.  It appears that were more people that took up Traveller during
the TNE era than the MT era, but the number were not particularly large.

   Prelimary conclusion: MegaTraveller did more to kill GDW, than TNE
(though I\'m sure at least one of you will say that while MT put the
company on life support, TNE pulled the plug); and Traveller fans are
probably the most loyal in the gaming industry--or perhaps the most
stubborn. <g>

   More later.

Regards,

Harold

Dave Nilsen said that he came to the conclusion that GDW was screwed when they 
issued the Regency sourcebook, for which everyone had been clamoring, but the 
distributors didn\'t pick it up in any significant quantities.  [My guess is 
the distributors had all their ready cash sunk into CCGs.]  After the TSR 
debacle, GDW just didn\'t have the reserves to continue.

I can\'t comment about other people, but TNE was what got me interested in 
Traveller.  I found both CT and MT uninspiring (although I liked 2300 a lot). 
Then, towards the end of MT, I began finding things I liked (the Rebellion 
Sourcebook, Starship Operators Manual, Survival Margin, the reissue of 
Imperium).  The more I read about TNE, the more excited I became.  [Incidently 
I claim to be the first person in the world to buy a copy of TNE -- I handed 
the money to Dave Nilsen while standing in the GDW warehouse the morning it 
shipped.  The distributors didn\'t have it yet.] After buying TNE, I began 
going back and purchasing all the CT and MT stuff, and now I have about 80% of 
the MT stuff and 70% of the CT stuff, including all of the boardgames.

For the record, though, I\'m not much of an RPG player (although I\'m certainly 
a buyer).  I\'m an SF and history buff, so RPGs often make good reading for me.  
Most of my gaming is historical and SF boardgaming, although I also play SF 
and naval miniatures.  My three favorite games of all time are probably Space 
Hulk, Triplanetary, and Imperium -- the last two being "proto-Traveller" games 
put out by GDW.

Not real surprising.  CT\'s system as it exists is dated.  MT had 
promise, and the errata makes it my favorite of the 3 systems, but 
without the errata it was a mess.  TNE being the newest and (I hate 
to say it) complete system (outside of its total lack of vehicle/ship 
design rules (yes I know, you can fall asleep trying to design them 
with FF&S) makes this not too surprising.  It sounds like NT will be 
closer to MT in design...

I\'d say that GDW\'s heavy emphasis on the RC as opposed to the Regency 
was probably what pulled the plug, in light of your findings.  Not 
coincidental that Spinward Marches was GDW\'s/DGP\'s most heavily 
developed area...  

Sounds like other GM\'s used the "official" universe as much as I 
did...

Quite the contrary.  All you need to do is read this list, and 
realize that TNE was in no way an attempt to "appease current 
players".  If it was, it was probably the poorest marketing decision 
since the New Coke...  It succeeded in pissing off a large majority 
of current players...

I think it was an attempt to attract new players...  I would say it 
had some success in doing so, but probably alienated more players 
than it attracted (otherwise GDW might still be a going concern...)

I guess I don\'t find this all that surprising.  After all the two 
lists (TML & XBoat) are by definition hard core players/fans of the 
game, otherwise they wouldn\'t be on the mailing lists.  I suspect 
that most of the CT/MT/TNE players will probably at least want to 
look at the new rules...  I would suspect that many people who played 
CT or MT  may have bought the MT/TNE rules, decided they didn\'t like the 
setting, didn\'t buy any more of the books for that setting, and went 
back to their old game.

I would suspect that initial reaction to T4 will be rather receptive 
by the readers...  Whether however, they buy further books will 
depend on what kind of a job IG has done in defining the setting, and 
writing/proofreading the books...

I already placed an order for 2 of the hardcovers...  I figured for 
the extra $5 for hardcover, I\'d be a fool not to...  There are others 
on this list as well.

Actually I have a different point of view on this.  I think GDW was a 
Dr. assisted suicide...they pulled their own plug.

If you look at the credits for MT, the whole system was basically 
written by DGP.  GDW went 2 years without publishing anything for the 
game themselves (other than Challenge) between 1988 (Rebellion 
Sourcebook), and 1990 (Fighting Ships of the Shattered 
Imperium).  Meanwhile, DGP wrote Starship Operators Manual, 
World Builders Handbook, Vilani & Vargr.  

When you look at what happened in those 2 years, its obvious why 
GDW is dead.  The two products that put GDW on the map were 
Traveller and the Europa series wargames.  

During this period they sold off the Europa series, and they stopped 
their support for Traveller.  How well would Coca Cola do if they suddenly 
stopped producing Coca Cola Classic and Diet Coke?  Instead they produced 
crap like Cadillacs and Dinosaurs.
  
GDW did figure out the error of their ways, but too little too late.  
They wrote Hard Times, and released some support material for it, and 
then TNE.  TNE was IMO a last ditch effort to save GDW.  If they\'d 
picked a different setting, it might have worked.  But they alienated 
a chunk of what customer base they had with the Virus idea, and then 
alienated more by ignoring the Regency (which is according to survey, 
the games favorite) for 2 years, while they wrote what amounted to 
Twilight 2K campaigns with spaceships for the Reformation Coalition.  
This alienated a lot of people who really are more interested in the 
first contact/mercantile aspects of Traveller than in playing 
Traveller Yahtzee with miniatures (Lots of combat die rolls with 
miniatures thrown in for graphics).  

(Personal opinion, Dave Nilsen\'s writing style, which sacrificed 
information in favor of puns, cliches, and very bad humor rubbed a 
lot of people the wrong way.  If Marc Miller is smart, he won\'t let 
Nilsen within a 1000 yards of his game if he wants it to succeed.  At 
least as a writer...) 

> probably the most loyal in the gaming industry--or perhaps the most
> stubborn. <g>

Judging by the vitality of the list for which no new material has 
been released for almost a year, I would take this a given.

I resemble this remark... :-)

I look forward to your results and analysis, Harold... :-)

        Remember that about a month ago I asked if anyone had done a
 program to simulate alien speech for the Amiga?  Well in the
following
 hours I DID write such a program and uploaded it promptly to MPGN,
 but it looks like they were too busy to process the uploads until
last
 week.  Anyways, here\'s a few lines from the READ.ME file:

AlienSpeak V1.0: 
on ftp.mpgn.com, Gaming/Traveller/Programs/Amiga, file aliensp.lzx

*Requires AmigaOS 2.04.  It might work on 1.3 without the special
voices.

*What does it do?  Two things:
        1) It translates words & sentences from any Traveller
language
 into the closest appriopriate phonemes available in the
speak-device.
        2) It says those words, using the speak-device to talk in the
 closest approximation of \'alien\' voices I could tune.
 
Things to note:
1) If you put in misspelled words or words that don\'t belong to the 
language, the program will show you where the error is.  It will
still
speak the sentence, but will skip that syllable.

Comments are welcome.

        Note that I have archived it using LZX.
        
        Also, I have noticed that my previous piece of software,
 TravMapper, has been removed from the ftp site.  As version 1.27
 has been ready for about a year, I will probably upload it there.
 It features must faster screen-refresh, planet filters, and a 
 fairly complete ARexx port with scripts for Trade and UWP 
 displays, and other uses possible.
 
 Finally, here\'s the consolidated Humaniti Random Appearance Table
 I offered to post.  It\'s in LaTeX format, but should be easy enough
 to clean up.  (the & are \'tabs\', \\pm is + or -.  I use \\pm 1 to 
 mean the values -1,0 or 1).

CCG\'s are so plenitful now that people do thing twice about buying

GDW got the pants sued off of them by TSR.  Apparently, parts of DJ

had right to the game (it was after all being worked on "their time").

I don\'t know all of the details, but from what I heard, T$R basically sued GDW 
because they really hate Gary Gygax.  They used some sort of \'we invented 
fantasy roleplaying\' sort of garbage as an excuse, but GDW just didn\'t have 
the financial resources to deal with it, so they settled.  It cost them a 
relatively large amount of money, but I don\'t know how much.

Just another reason to hate T$R (like I needed another one).

	In /favor/ of TNE?  Hmmm.  Of course, that just means that there 
are more TNE players /on these lists/, not necessarily more TNE players 
in the general population.

	That sounds likely to me, as well.  But, I think the new 
Traveller will be what MT and TNE SHOULD have been.  The trick in the 
upgrading thing is retaining your current customer base while gaining new 
customers.  Witness Windows \'95, which is less stable and more bloated 
than it could have been if the Windows 3.x compatability had been left 
out.  Microsoft realizes that they would have lost a lot of customers 
(ie, they would have stayed with Windows 3.x, or moved to another 
platform) had they forced a shift to a noncompatable Windows environment.
	From all I have heard from Ken at IG, T4 will be fully backwards 
compatable with CT.  You can take your CT character and, without making 
any changes at all, run him under T4 rules.  You can grab any CT 
adventure, and run it under T4 rules as well.  The T4 rules are different 
in places, it is true, but the compatability issue seems to have been 
resolved well.

	According to my "Big CT Products List," not much was released in 
1982.  1983-84 were the best years for Traveller products.  Lots of 
re-releases (Mayday, Snapshot, etc.) and new products (Starter Traveller, 
Beltstrike, etc.).
	On the other hand, lots of great stuff came out for Traveller in 
1981, which may in fact be the reason behind the 1982 start-date being so 
popular.  For instance, Paranoia Press had lots of good products, the 
Deluxe Traveller set came out, and Judges\' Guild came out with a lot of 
Traveller material.

	I remember how it was at the game shop I used to frequent in 
California (Games Unlimited, in the Willows shopping center, for those 
familiar with the SF bay area).  During the CT era, Traveller products 
were carried in the back corner, right next to the high-traffic AD&D and 
miniatures sections.  They had the Traveller wire rack with the 
digest-sized books, and several shelves of larger Traveller material.  
	When the MT era began, the Traveller stuff was moved to the 
bottom shelf in the middle of the store.  Then, when the game didn\'t do 
very well, it was moved to the BACK of that bottom shelf, making it 
impossible to see unless on got down on his hands and knees.  
	While this definitely didn\'t help sales in that particular shop, 
it also is an indication of how the gaming community in the area received 
the new system.  The owner isn\'t stupid - if it was a good seller, he 
would have kept it in a prominent location.  Heck, if products would have 
come out for it on any kind of regular basis, it probably would have had 
better positioning.  But since from 88-90 it virtually appeared to be an 
abandoned system, it got relegated to the back, bottom shelves.

	Sounds reasonable to me, as I indicated above.  While MT 
maintained better CT compatability than did TNE, the result clearly shows 
that this was yet another upgrade that was handled poorly.  Lack of 
product, tons of errors in the manuals, and other mistakes undoubtedly 
killed MT, and Traveller with it.

	Again, I look forward to it.

I\'d have to disagree here.  I have a friend who owns a small gaming store,
and CCGs are still his hotest item.  Granted, he only stocks Magic, Star
Wars, Star Trek, Werewolf and a few others, but still, sales are supposedly
hotter than ever for MTG (ARGH!  I hate it!).

However, I personally *really* enjoy a CCG just released by Chaosium, called
"Mythos" based on Call of Cthulthu (sorry about the spelling).

What I think would be cool is a Traveller based CCG.  Anyone from Imperium
want to answer this question, is there a Traveller CCG on the drawing board.
If so, I\'d give a few suggestions:

1)  Make it character orientated.  Have the player play one character who is
*really* in the game (unlike MTG\'s \'abstract\' wizard who isn\'t a real card
or anything but just takes damage, and more like Chaosium\'s Mythos
investigator).

2)  Don\'t make killing the other players the object of the game, have some
scenarios\\adventurer\\quests to complete in whicha player must go to certain
places, get objects etc. to complete them

3)  Have a set of defined SOLO-RULES in the rulebook.  Some of us (myself
included) enjoy playing alone or can\'t get anyone else to shell out the cash
to buy any cards.

Well, that\'s just my two cents worth,

Peter Miller

I\'ve got a question, what\'s the Third Imperium\'s TL?  IN the Referee\'s
Manual (MT), it gives the Imperium a TL 9 (avg stellar).  However, some
planets, such as Capital and Terra have TLs of 15.  Does the 9 signify the
average of all planets?  Also, what are the TLs of the Aslan, Hivers,
K\'Kree, Zhodani, etc.?

I would think that sound and light would be quite effective still on their

It would be good is you could calibrate it, but as for Aliens, they\'d still
have get specimens to figure out what the calibrations needed to be.

I think I misstated things here.  What I really should have said is 
that the CCG market seems to be saturated...

I have a feeling that a Traveller CCG would merely get lost in the 
shuffle...

I wouldn\'t mind one though.

You got it...

For the heck of it looking at the 2D Traveller spacemap

Directions are as follows.

North=Coreward (towards the Galactic Core
South=Rimward 
East=Trailing
West=Spinward

The Spinward Marches are at the spinward extremity of the Imperium.  
They and the remainder of the Domain of Deneb, are connected to the 
Imperium only by a tenuous link of worlds in the Corridor Sector (2 
sectors to Trailing from Spinward Marches.

In MegaTraveller, the Corridor Sector is overrun by the Vargr, and 
the link was cut...

North (or Coreward) depending on what version you are playing, is the Galactic 
core.

According to CT/MT/TNE the Zhodani made several expeditions towards 
the Galactic core, guided by an Ancients artifact.  What they found 
there is some sort of alien race or creatures which apparently have a 
powerful impact on Psionic practicioners, like the Zhodani...

West (or Spinward) is pretty much uncharted and unknown, once you get 
about a sector beyond the Zhodani Consulate.

Actually I have a different point of view on this.  I think GDW was a 
Dr. assisted suicide...they pulled their own plug.

<deleted>
written by DGP.  GDW went 2 years without publishing anything for the 
game themselves (other than Challenge) between 1988 (Rebellion 
Sourcebook), and 1990 (Fighting Ships of the Shattered 
Imperium). 

When you look at what happened in those 2 years, its obvious why 
GDW is dead.  The two products that put GDW on the map were 
Traveller and the Europa series wargames.  

During this period they sold off the Europa series, and they stopped 
their support for Traveller. Instead they did crap like Cadillacs &
Dinosaurs.
  
GDW did figure out the error of their ways, but too little too late.  
They wrote Hard Times, and released some support material for it, and 
then TNE. 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let\'s not forget when GDW apparently fell under the evil influence of
E. Gary Gygax. How in the world they ever thought they\'d get away with
DD/DV w/o major litigation is completely beyond my reasoning, esp. con-
sidering TSR\'s previous track record. It sorta\' reminds me of when the
old USFL decided to switch from a spring to a fall schedule. They knew
that they didn\'t have a chance going up against the NFL but figured
they\'d make more money from an anti-trust lawsuit than by continuing
to operate. What really happened is, of course, history. Needless to
say the USFL got neither money nor kept their league operating.
==============================================================

(Personal opinion, Dave Nilsen\'s writing style, which sacrificed 
information in favor of puns, cliches, and very bad humor rubbed a 
lot of people the wrong way.  If Marc Miller is smart, he won\'t let 
Nilsen within a 1000 yards of his game if he wants it to succeed.  At 
least as a writer...)

Here\'s my question for Marc Miller.  It\'s kind of a two parter.

Recognizing that Traveller is first and foremost a pencil, paper and 
dice game, it perhaps more than most other RPG\'s makes heavy demands on 
referees of a bookkeeping nature.  Is there any plan afoot, for 
either Imperium Games or a third party licensee to make software 
supporting the game, such as a ship/vehicle building system, world 
generation in the vein of World Builders Handbook, cargo system 
or anything else?  Will IG be defining standard data formats for others 
to use in designing such software?

MMT:  Mark Miller\'s TRAVELLER.  This is what Imperium Games seems to be 
calling the new version, so maybe this would work.  Or does this seem too 
much like MegaMegaTraveller :-) ?

IGT:  Imperium Games TRAVELLER.  It won\'t be confused with any of the

FFT:  Far Future TRAVELLER.  Possibility of being confused with FF&S?

Oh, in that case I agree wholeheartedly.  There are way too many CCGs on the

Highlander) gets a card game.  It\'s sickening.

You\'re probably right it\'d get lost in the shuffle, but not to Traveller
Ffans like ourselvers.  I\'ve found that CCGs based on a RPG (eg. Mythos, On
the Edge) are targetted mostly on the people who already play the RPG.

  The most surprising result was the answer to the question regarding
whether or not people were considering the purchase of the new
Traveller.  My theory going into this exercise is that there would be a
small group of people who had been around Traveller for a while, who
were still die hard fans of the game, but had had enough, and while
they still planned on playing some version of it, it would be T4.  If that
group does exist, they didn\'t respond to my survey.  The overwhelming
majority of you plan on buying at least some of the new IG\'s Traveller
products, and many of you plan on buying all of them sight unseen.
While there was a significant percentage of you that still want to see
more before you will consider a purchase, *no one* ruled it completely
out.
- ----

	I don\'t see why this result is surprising at all.  So far, almost
everyone I\'ve talked to or emailed with has reacted positively to the
things they\'ve heard about NT/T4.  I personally know at least 5 people who
refused to buy TNE but plan to come back for NT/T4.  Phil MacGregor even
saw a draft of the equipment section and seems to have given it his
hard-gained approval (Not a flame Phil, but you do seem to have, shall we
say, a knack for incicive critique? :-). 
	Everything I\'ve seen indicates that IG is a company that will 
love Traveller as much as its fans (unlike GDW, who seemed reluctant 
about the whole thing).  And I am absolutely impressed by the team 
they\'ve assembled and most (though not all, of course) of the ideas they 
have put forth.  I would say this is a common opinion among the Traveller 
devotees I know.
	I would say that I\'ve only seen a minority of TNE blowhards 
(diehards! I meant diehards! :-) who absolutely refuse to go back to the 
so-called "70\'s era rules" (whatever that means).  And even long-time 
TNE\'ers are considering the NT/T4 project. 

Okay, I time to don the asbestos underwear...

	When Marc Miller wrote to me recently to thank me for supporting 
Traveller by purchasing two copies of the hardback version, in his 
message he said, "Thank you for your support of T4."  So, if MM is 
calling it "T4," I\'d say that\'s the official acronym.

Yup...anyday now, I expect to see Twister, the CCG, or Mission: 
Impossible: the CCG... :-)

I live in constant fear of Steel Magnolias: The CCG, however... ;-)

Very, very true...Hell, I don\'t even like CCG\'s and I\'d probably buy one...

BTW, isn\'t it great to be able to discuss and look forward to where 
the game is going again?  Six months ago, about all anybody was 
talking about was the death rattle of GDW on TML, and how much they 
hated TNE on XTML...

Marc, First, thanks for bringing Traveller back.  It is the best role-playing
game I have experienced.  Secondly, thanks for taking time to answer these questions.  

Question:  Some of the players that play in our group are really attached to the
Classic Traveller method of handling Computers.  We had several adventures around trying to get jump tapes, and usually both them from the shareware tape
vendor "Jermain Domain" who sold stuff written by his brother "Public". (I suppose you had to be there).  But later Traveller products got away from the
day-to-day software handling of CT.  Others wish that the computers in Traveller were more like those in Star Trek, all powerful complete control of the vessel things.  Mega-Traveller was more Starwars\'ish where the computer didn\'t have a
real role, just there, and modified a few rolls.

Comments have been made that the equipment is going to have a big face lift, to make it more sci-fi for the 90s.  So, my question, how would you describe the 
role of computers in the new "Traveller"?

Thanks
Rob

I genuinely wonder how many people actually use FF&S.  Not own it, 
but actively use it.  I don\'t mind bookkeeping, but I took 1 look at FF&S, 
and thought, "Gee, with my spare time, it\'d take me about 2 weeks to generate 
a ship..."  Not to mention having to design turrets and ammunition for the thing...  

Sorry, but IMNSHO, science fiction is high adventure, contacts with 
aliens, alien artifacts, starship battles...alien worlds and 
cultures, not a geeky discussion over HEPlaR vs. Thrusters, neither of which 
exist, and most likely won\'t exist in our lifetimes...

True, somebody could design stuff with an FF&S Lite, but then you 
might as well go ahead and use a different, less comprehensive design 
system...

Accordingly, I think it\'d be worthwhile to take a poll  (OH, GOD, NOT 
ANOTHER ONE...)  :-)

The What Design System Are You Using Poll:
1. Are you currently playing Traveller using Traveller: The New Era 
rules, regardless of setting?

2.  Do you own a copy of FF&S (Fire, Fusion & Steel)?

3. Have you ever used FF&S to design a starship, weapon, vehicle or 
other items?

4. Have you ever used the posted FF&S Lite rules to design items?

5.  Do you own the Megatraveller Rules?

6. Have you ever designed a starship, vehicle, or small craft with 
the MegaTraveller rules?

7. Do you own a version of the Classic Traveller rules (Traveller 
Book, Little black books, Deluxe Traveller, Starter Traveller)?

8.  Do you have Book 5, High Guard?

9.  Do you have Striker?

10.  Have you ever designed ships using Book 2, Starships?

11.  Have you ever designed ships using Book 5, High Guard?

12. Have you ever designed vehicles or other items using Striker?

13. If you have experience with more than 1 system, please state your 
preference for designing starships: (Book 2, Starships, Book 5, High 
Guard, MegaTraveller, FF&S)

14. If you have experience with more than 1 system, please state your 
preference for designing vehicles (Striker, MegaTraveller, FF&S)

: I genuinely wonder how many people actually use FF&S.  Not own it, but
: actively use it.  I don\'t mind bookkeeping, but I took 1 look at FF&S,
: and thought, "Gee, with my spare time, it\'d take me about 2 weeks to

: ammunition for the thing... 

People must be using it otherwise they wouldn\'t be complaining about
it.  I found it no more cumbersome than any other design system once I
got the hang of it (and yes, all design systems take some getting used
to).

: Sorry, but IMNSHO, science fiction is high adventure, contacts with 
: aliens, alien artifacts, starship battles...alien worlds and 
: cultures, not a geeky discussion over HEPlaR vs. Thrusters, neither of which 
: exist, and most likely won\'t exist in our lifetimes...

I\'d say the same thing, but then why do people complain so much about
how accurate is the system generation rules?  Why do the combat rules
work the way they do?  What about character generation?  The fact of
the matter is that rules make a game and the people playing that game
make it an adventure.  It\'s all the same argument, people just tend to
not care about something unless it\'s what they\'re interested in.

: True, somebody could design stuff with an FF&S Lite, but then you 
: might as well go ahead and use a different, less comprehensive design 
: system...

FF&S Lite is an idea to make FF&S feel more like the old design
sequences.

I think that FF&S is greatly stigmatized because instead of being in
the form of basic and then advanced, it was just advanced.  My best
friend said it looked like an old calculas textbook to him (but then
again, he used WBH to create a planet of Flea and Mary Lou Retton
clones--he likes to make planets and systems, and I like to make
gadgets and ships).

Then again, for MT, to be able to create anything that I could with
FF&S, I had to own the Referee\'s Manual, COACC, Hard Times, and a buch
of issues of Challenge which had low-tech design systems in them.  And
BTRC\'s 3G^3 for weapon design.  I think I preferred the convenience of
having them all in one place with FF&S.  Ask William Hostman about the
package I sent him.

Why should I have to create?  Why shouldn\'t I?  I like to be able to
create items that are consistent to game universe.  With no guidelines
this can\'t really happen.  After all, my def of TL15 and yours could
be radically different.

As an aside, I remember back in 1988 people bitching and moaning that
MT\'s design system clobbered their HG designs.  No longer could you
have a 6G, J4, outta this world agility ship in under 50 tons.  Man,
there were a lot of unhappy people out there.  And many of them got
used to MT and then became unhappy when there was yet another design
system to get used to.

One last rant.  I don\'t see why people argue over the differences in
technology.  Let\'s look at some of the changes over the years.  100
ton limit for starships, HEPlaR vs Thrusters, jump fuel usage.  In CT,
I don\'t ever remember seeing a 100 ton limit, as far as I know, it was
added in MT.  All of the sudden it\'s an issue to CanonMongers?  Why,
because it doesn\'t fit in with TypoTraveller or because it\'s part of
TNE.  What will we do if T4 has no 100 ton limit.  HEPlaR!  What a
great subject.  I once asked someone why they don\'t just use Thrusters
instead.  There are even design rules for them in FF&S.  I mean we all
know that HEPlaR was just a tool to make space combat more exciting.
And it\'s not like every player follows the rules religiously and
doesn\'t change anything to their liking.  His response basically was
that if he use Thrusters, he wouldn\'t have anything to bitch about
with TNE.  And fuel use.  We do all know that you use all your jump
fuel whether you jump the full capacity of your drive or partial
capacity.  However no one seemed to mind this CHANGE IN CANON.  That\'s
probably due to the fact that many people did away with this
restriction under CT and MT.

Take it easy, and remember I\'m not really defending TNE per se, but
rather pointing out how people always look for something to complain
about.

SF tradition is part of it, but there\'s a practical justification -- when 
your society is spread out over long distances, time-wise, local 
governments have to have a lot of autonomy.  A feudal system, where the 
local rulers can act as they see fit on most issues, is likely to be one 
of the more effective ways to govern, when orders from the capital take 
months, or years, to arrive.  Democracies require good internal 
communications.

	Because they call it Space Opera..that\'s why.  The reason you see it 
so much in SF is that it\'s an easy cop-out way of having a 
pre-concieved governmental structure that all readers have some idea 
of it\'s structure...this is the same &@#%@$ reason Trav has 
cutlasses...sigh.

	The Rule of Man was called the Ramshackle Empire for good reason 
 Its government derived from the Solomani military takeover of 
Vilani government.  It was a sort of  autocratic sort of feudal sort of 
bureaucracy that, mainly, left things to local administrators to keep 
things running.  Therefore, I suspect the gamut ran from sheer 
anarchy to utter autocracy, and everything in between, depending on 
the resourcefulness and/or ambition of the local commander. 

	This, among other things, was what led to the Long Night; this lack 
of centralized authority, or more precisely, lack of centralized 
SOURCE of authority.  No government with communication lag times 
restricted by Jump 2 travel times can operate with any sort of 
centralized authority...the officials on scene have to pretty much 
run everything themselves. What makes the difference between this 
turning into a lot of independent states and a single empire is

   When you consider that many of the TNEers have had to purchase
three rules sets in 10-12 years, and soon face the prospect of
purchasing a forth, customer loyalty was,  I believed,  a real question. 
That question has been resoundingly answered.

   <gasp!>  Now I\'m not so sure I want to buy it.  <G>  Well now *I* want
to see the equipment section if for no other reason but to see what
``Phil Approved`` means.

   It is very similar to the pool they had back in pre-1987 era.  Hopefully
the product will be a good too.

   Careful, careful....

>(whatever that means).

   It means that they consider TNE to be an improvement over the two
previous generations of the rules, so why regress?  I\'m not convinced
that the new Traveller will be a regrind of the old rules, with underskilled
characters (pre-Merc, pre-HG, pre-Scouts, etc. that is) a total lack of
meaningful design sequences, and the old ``base of 8 or greater`` to
resolve things.  I don\'t think that\'s anything people want--RPGs have
progressed way beyond that point.

>And even long-time  TNE\'ers are considering the NT/T4 project. 

   To have invested in TNE, you either had to be new to Traveller (with
no preconceived notions of orthodoxy), or incredibly loyal to GDW.
TNE was nothing more or less than an attempt to do exactly what
Imperium Games is setting out to do right now--revive something that has
proven to be one of the best and most popular sci-fi games of all time,
and attempt to recapture some of the flavor of the original game at the
same time.  Having had the benefit of talking with Frank Chadwick and
Dave Nilsen, I can tell you that was what they were trying to do.  You
can debate how successful they were at it, but that was their intention.

Regards,

Harold

Yes, definitely!  I only bought Traveller two months ago, and I found this
list about the same time.  All I saw was people flaming each other and
complaining about GDW\'s death, so I was kind of angry that I
d even purchased it, seeing that their would obivously be no support

at having an interview with the creator of the game, and gettign feedback

lot more than some companies (who will remain nameless) have done.

Secondly, excellent Web Page!  I check back regularly, and I love the
addition of pictures (from the general art to the "roster").  

Okay, here\'s my questions.

In MegaTraveller, the design system for ship\'s takes me a while, because I
don\'t know that much about it.  I found that, looking through the Referee\'s
Manual and Imperial Encyclopedia didn\'t really help explain some facets of
the ship (like the thruster plates, and different G-force speeds).  I was
wondering two things, will T4 have a BASIC and ADVANCED ship generation so
you can choose how detailed the ship will be?  Also, will T4 explain the
different facets of the ship\'s system with more depth than before?

I\'m a newbie to xboat and am just now getting back into Traveller
after about a 10 year hiatus.  I\'ve been receiving xboat-digest for about
a month now and must say it is one of the most interesting list-servs I\'ve
ever subscribed to.

Ok, here\'s my question:
While reading Library Data A-M on the train this morning I came across
something related to a May 11th post that sparked some confusion on
my part.

On May 11th someone wrote:
>>2. If a ship manages to make the right rolls and

In Library Data (A-M) pg.6 it states:
"A jump drive is both fast and simple.  With one, it is possible
to move from here to there (where both  places are at least one
hundred planetary diameters out from any large masses) in a period
of about a week."

I was wondering if SSOMv1 allows some special rules for making
jumps closer than 100 PDs from a large mass (planet)?  Further
more, I could not find any reference to SSOMv1 in the Traveller
Big List.  Could anyone provide more info about SSOMv1?

Thanks much.  I\'m sorry if these are stupid questions but I\'m just
trying to get my bearings again.

Oh, and an ironic FYI:

IMHO, I hope they don\'t come out with a T4 CCG.

Secondly, about the Traveller CCG, I think it would be a neat twist
(and give the game a chance at product demarkation from the rest :) 
if it could be played by mail or something like that.  Or at least
if it could be played in conjuction with other Traveller products
(i.e. use of Traveller miniatures improves the performances (A la 
Warhammer where you have \'characters\') or you can use \'character\'
cards to perform certain actions during the RPG.  As a help to
role-play or whatever (See \'Castle Falkenstein\' :).

Finally, I wonder if anybody else has done something like this
with their technology?  I expect the new equipment book to have
something
like this, but of course I haven\'t seen it.  This is a partial list
of what I\'ve come up with:  (sorry, LaTeX again :)

\\section{Jane\'s guide to Traveller Equipment}
\\subsection{An explanation of Data Links}
Data Links represents the way different pieces of machinery and
humans
communicate together.  There are several different standards, but
any device using a known standard can share the data on that channel
with any other device with that standard.  Prefixes represents
non-imperial uses (Z for Zhodani, etc), and suffixes represent limits
and variations to the standards.

Here is a list of the known standards and their uses:
\\begin{itemize}
\\item {\\em TAC} Carries tactical data; ennemy number, type and
        position, current device status, current tactic pursued.
\\item {\\em FLICK} Means device can be activated using Zhodani
\'flicking\'
        skill.
\\item {\\em LIFE} Means transmission of lifesign data.
\\item {\\em NAS} is transmission of neural activity data.
\\item {\\em VISU} is visual data.
\\item {\\em AUD} is audio data.
\\item {\\em OLF} is olfactory data.
\\item {\\em VEH} is vehicle location and status.
\\item {\\em I-} stands for imperial standard.  It is there by default
        on Imperial devices.
\\item {\\em Z-} Means a Zhodani variation on the standard.
\\item {\\em -SLO} Means that data trickles at a slow rate, typically
10
        rounds instead of one.
\\item {\\em -S} Means the channel is in send mode only and cannot
receive
        data.
\\item {\\em -R} Means the channel is in receive mode only and cannot
        send data.

Note: When designing equipment, all communication gear has the basic
standards for that equipment (ex: NAS sensors get the NAS-SLO-R mode,
vehicle computers get the VEH-SLO-SR mode).  If a computer is used,
a 2 modifications can use made on a comm channel for each level of
Communication-1 programmed in the computer.  (ex: the above computer 
can be upgraded to ZI-VEH-SR).  It costs 5% of the total device cost
to improve non-computerized comm devices.

Just my 2 credit\'s worth - and who knows what that\'s worth since the
Imperium has failed! :)

Starship Operators Manual v.1 is a MegaTraveller book that was put 
out by Digest Group Publications (DGP).  It\'s kind of a Star Trek 
Technical Manual for Traveller, built around the generic 200 ton free 
trader.  Out of print for a long time, but very worthwhile if you can 
get a copy.  It was not on the big list because the big list 
that Joe and others posted was solely devoted to Classic Traveller.

As for what it says about jumping within 100 diameters it increases 
the difficulty of the task roll. 

By comparison:
Outside of 100 diameters:  
Routine, Engineering, Edu, 2 min.
Routine is a basic 7+ roll to succeed, modified by Engineering and 
Edu.  Assuming a competent engineer, with a good education, this is 
almost automatic in MT. An Engineer-3 with an 8 education succeeds on 
3+. A 96% chance of success.

Inside of 100 diameters:
Difficult, Engineering, Edu, 2 min.
Basic roll is 11+ 
The same engineer listed above, would succeed on a 7+.  About 
a 58% chance of success. 

According to MT, Inside of 10 diameters, the situation gets even 
riskier:
Formidable, Engineering, Edu
Basic roll is 15+
The same engineer listed above, would succeed on an 11+ 
or about an 8% chance of success.

Failure could result in a misjump, or in extreme cases, destruction 
of the ship.

Regarding your comments about CCG\'s.  I\'m not a big fan of them 
either.  However, they are bigger than RPG\'s right now.  If a T4 CCG 
winds up drawing a few more people into wanting to RPG our favorite 
system, and can do so while maintaining the flavor of the overall 
Traveller game...I think it would be worth it.

And that is about the only good thing I\'ve ever said about CCG\'s...

Ah, another person who reads Traveller in public.  I keep waiting for the 
police to notice my dirty little habit of reading little black books in 
mixed company, but so far nothing untoward has happened. :P

	"The Big List of Classic Traveller Products" only lists items 
from the pre-MegaTraveller era, whereas SSOMv1 is a MegaTraveller item.  
Isn\'t there a different list containing MT items provided on one of the 
Traveller web sites?

	Heck, I\'ve been playing Traveller since \'83, and I\'m STILL 
learning things about the CT universe. :)

Has anybody heard from DGP lately?  I got a couple of posts a few
months back, but nothing since.  I\'d love a chance to get my hands on
a couple of their books that I can\'t find in the used book stores,
SSOM and WBH, in particular.

Roger was talking about reviving some of the DGP books..or putting
them on CD-ROM if he could get permission.  

How about it Rog?  Anything happening?

Here\'s a thought for IG!  I was never bothered about reading the
little black books in public, but the covers of MT & TNE...<g>

I\'d prefer the small form books.  I\'d perfer simple black covers. I
also know that IG\'s not going to give me either preference. The books
will be A4 format and the covers will be..uhmm, let\'s say, colorful.

	Nothing like wearing a three-piece suit while reading something 
that looks very much like a comic book/graphic novel. :)

	Colorful covers are better for merchandizing, I\'m sure, but I 
prefer the little black books as well.  Oh, well.  At least Traveller is 
back, and (hopefully) better than ever. :)

Oh well, indeed! 

If the books are going to be full sized a good idea would be to have
them hole-punched.  That way they could be kept in binders:  

1. protects the books from normal wear and tear

2. errata could be added on loose leaf sheets

3. game/campaign notes could go right into the notebooks.

4. and it\'d be a good way to disguise them in public <g>

Hey, I\'ll bet the Hardbacks will have a colorful dust
jacket, but the hardback itself will likely be fairly plain..hum,
another good reason to get one (or two) of them. <g>

>At least Traveller is  back, and (hopefully) better than ever. :)

I\'ve always maintained that Traveller is more a game spirit than a set
of rules.  The biggest objection I had to TNE was its spirit..it
*felt* more like TW2K than Traveller.  Marc was the man behind the
spirit of the original game, I\'m looking for him to bring the *feel*
back.  

I\'ll change the rules and background around to fit whatever campaign I
run anyway. <g>

Thanks. My reason for introducing this was that I found it difficult to
accept that it had been possible to whip up antipathy against a psionic
minority when there was no psionic minority. I mean, if more than half
the population is able to get some sort of useful psi ability, where\'s
the minority?

Psionic potential is a hereditary characteristic. With +8 for both parents
having psi potential, an individual in an ordinary (neither pro- nor anti-
psionic) will automatically have potential himself.

No, you roll 2D if you roll a 2, 3 or 4, you have psi potential. If your
culture has favoured psi for millenia you have potential on 6- and so
forth.

Yes, very true. I hadn\'t considered that, not having had to use this roll
for any Zhodani in my campaign.

I *think* they\'re going to call T4, TRAVELLER.  Maybe officially Marc
Miller\'s TRAVELLER.

I don\'t really care what it\'s name turns out to be, *I* am going to
abbreviate it T4!  Both Ken Whitman and Marc Miller used the T4
abbreviation in posts to the list..shouldn\'t that make it canon?  <g>

Standard abbreviations:  CT, MT, TNE, and T4.  That\'s the ticket!

Marches (up to about Third Imperium Year 1120) into one database, so that,
for example, when my players return to the Efate system, they always find
the planets Enur, Jor, Efate, Solon, Stur, Llun, and Yor Shar.
 
Will the new Traveller product line include computer databases (capable of
being updated) of, at least, this sort of basic astrographic information to
improve campaign consistency?  If not, why not?

Thank you for your kind attention, and good luck.

That\'s a good point.  When I think of Traveller, I do think of the feel 
of the game more than anything else.  It has a feel that is different 
from all the old sci-fi books I read, and it is certainly different from 
Star Trek.  But, that\'s MY Traveller, which leads into...

I change rules, too, as those who have seen my "house rules" know. 

And I thought I changed the setting quite a bit as well, until I read 
more of the official material on the Imperium.  We started out with 
nothing more than was in the Deluxe Traveller (Starter Edition), and 
Supplement 3: The Spinward Marches.  My Imperium was a federalist-type 
regime.  They governed happenings that occurred outside of the domain of 
local governments, for the most part.  You didn\'t walk into a starport 
and see clusters of Imperial troops patrolling.  You couldn\'t turn to the 
Imperium to help you overthrow your "oppressive" world-government.  

Mostly, the Megacorps were the ones who were active on multiple worlds 
(ie, one megacorp might be persuaded to finance a revolution, if it had 
some economic interest to do so).  

Pretty original ideas, I thought.

Turns out, of course, that the Imperium IS mostly a trade organization.  
Sure, they go to war with the Heirate, the Solomani, and the Zhodani, but 
they aren\'t even as visible as the least opressive Earth government for 
most citizens.  

So, while I did have a slightly different vision of the Imperium, it 
wasn\'t as far off as I had thought.  

Has anyone made major changes to the Traveller universe?  Have you 
scrapped it entirely and played using your own universe?

Er...I think we\'re in agreement here...overall.  But I have heard 
people who first got lured into the hobby by CCG\'s move on RPG\'s.  If 
a "Good" CCG (whatever that is...), might draw a little bit of young 
blood into the hobby, and in particular into our favorite game, 
this is a good thing...  

Your sarcastic comments remind me of a time about 15-20 years ago 
(Yes, I am showing my age here).  I began as a straight wargamer, and 
remember the sarcastic comments that wargamers had about RPG\'s...  
There were people actively predicting and hoping for the demise of 
D&D, Tunnels and Trolls, Traveller, and the other popular RPG\'s at 
the time.  They viewed the RPG\'s in much the same snide sort of way 
that you regard.  I distinctly remember wargamers belittling Traveller 
when I was in a game store buying the latest supplement release to the 
little black books, back in 1980-1981, and I sure as hell am not going to 
be as closed minded about CCG\'s as they were to me.  Well guess what, 
those 30 somethings are now in their 50\'s, mostly out of the hobby, and 
the hobby has now fallen into our hands as the new generation of 30 
somethings.  CCG\'s are the domain of the teen and early 20 somethings, 
and we\'re the ones belittling them.  

Sorry guys, but if you want RPG\'s to survive as a genre, ragging on 
CCG\'s is not the way to go about it.  Those people playing CCG\'s 
are the folks who will be (or may already be) playing RPG\'s.  If they 
don\'t start playing RPG\'s, the hobby as we know it will die.  RPG 
players as a whole are already graying.  All but 1 of the people who 
played in my campaigns 15 years ago probably haven\'t cracked open 
a book in 10 years.  The rest are married...hell, one of them is DEAD.  
I was probably fortunate to have married somebody who shares almost 
as much of a passion for the hobby as I do, or I would have probably 
been forced out of it a long time ago.

Don\'t get me wrong.  I\'ve never played a CCG,  and it\'d take me a lot 
of convincing to do otherwise, BUT they are here, and they are NOT 
going to go away.  Yes, the CCG craze will die down, and a lot of the 
MTG wannabes will curl up, die and go away, but CCG\'s will never be 
completely gone.  Go into your average game store now.  CCG\'s 
dominate a lot of aisle space, and generate a lot of sales.  Quite a 
few game companies would be gone now if it hadn\'t been for the CCG\'s. 
 GDW was hurt by them because GDW didn\'t see the potential in them.  

I fondly hope to see a T4 card game, IF (and only if) it is well done 
and consistent with the Traveller universe.  Then when I see a guy 
fondling a deck of Traveller cards in a local game store next time, I\'ll see if the 
guy wants to join in a live campaign.  The group I referee now, are 
converted D&D players.  None of them had ever played Traveller before 
they met me, now they don\'t play anything else.  So now I can convert 
MTG players.  

The biggest weakness of the card games is that the game is as big as the deck.  
In an RPG, the only limits are that of the imagination of the referee, and to a 
lesser extent the players.  Let the card game wet their appetite, 
like an egg roll before the entree.  Then get them in a campaign, and 
see how things are really done.  :-)

	Agreed.  But, will it?  I have heard stories of it having 
happened to some people already, but never anything in large numbers.  
Sort of like the wargamers to RPGs migration that happened lo those many 
years ago.  More below . . .

Look at where wargames are now.  They\'re still around, but they\'re a tiny 
niche market.  Will this be the fate of RPG\'s in 20 years?  Will the CCG 
players "backwards migrate" only in small numbers, leaving the bulk of 
gamers in the CCG arena (at least, until /another/ 20 years go by, and 
they\'re standing around the game store scoffing at the then-latest craze)?
What do you think?

I think it won\'t happen that way.  Generally, wargames are difficult to 
learn, time-consuming, and of very specific interest (ie, people that 
like to wargame have an interest in tactics, large-scale combat, etc.).  
RPGs grew out of wargames.  RPGs were somewhat complex (again, 
generally), but open to a lot of interests.  Whether you like combat, 
romance, mysteries, or any situation at all, it could be done in RPGs.  
This broad base of interests brought in a lot more players than had 
wargames.  Some wargamers liked the idea of RPGs (and so migrated to 
them), while many others did not.

Now we have CCGs, which are again interesting to a fairly broad range of 
people.  The major thing they have going for them, though, is simplicity.  
Just about anyone can understand how to play.  That is, the barriers to 
entry are low, wheras RPGs typically require a larger investment of time, 
and have a steeper learning curve.  In short, the CCG\'s are at least as 
different from RPGs as wargames and RPGs are.

The things RPGs have going for them, which wargames did not, are:

1)  Notariety.  Just about everyone has heard of Dungeons and Dragons.  
TSR, love \'em or hate \'em, brings out products targeted to new RPGers, 
and they have the trademark ("D&D") recognition to pull it off.  I saw a 
beginers D&D product at the games store a while back that offered 
simplified rules and a clear upgrade path to AD&D.  There\'s also the old 
Dungeon game, and variants thereof, to get new gamers started on the road 
to full-blown role-playing.

2)  Depth.  You just can\'t get the depth of play you get with an RPG in a 
CCG, a wargame, a dice game (ie, "Dragon Dice) or any of the other RPG 
spin-offs.  

So, while the wargame vs. RPG battle resulted in RPGs 
emerging as dominant, this time around RPGs will remain strong.  As in 
the battle with wargames, RPGs offer something much greater than the 
competition does.  I think RPGs will emerge the winner once again.

	I agree that ragging on CCGs isn\'t the way to ensure the survival 
of RPGs.  But I would restate your second sentence as, "Those people 
playing CCG\'s MAY BE the folks who will be playing RPG\'s."  I really 
don\'t think there is a significant natural crossover between the two game 
types.  CCGs have almost nothing in common with RPGs.  One is a card 
game, one is a storymaking game.  Nonetheless, I would like to see those 
of us in the RPG community reach out to the CCGers, and help them to 
cross over.  As you point out, the RPG community is "greying."  It would 
be nice to have thousands of new role-players.  Especially Traveller 
role-players.

	I would also like to see a T4 card game if it is done right.  In 
addition to the consistency issue you point out, I would like for there 
to be a clear path for players to follow in upgrading to the real thing.  
I have no idea, off the top of my head, of how this would be done.  But 
it is important to make sure the card players are not kept as a separate 
audience, but rather eventually folded into the role-playing population.  
In order for this to happen, the card players have to see a clear and 
strong connection between their card game and the RPG.  Something more 
than a name and a setting.  The card game has to retain the full flavor 
of the Traveller game.  Again, I don\'t now how (or if) this can be done, 
but if it is possible, and if it is implemented, I would welcome a 
Traveller CCG.

I ran my Traveller Universe in the Andromeda Galaxy. The basic history of
it was that the Solomani discovered some kind of capability to travel the
space between galaxies (the tech was irrelevant as I will explain below). 

The capability to travel between galaxies disappeared and the Solomani were
trapped in the galaxies they colonized. The Solomani brought their superiority
theories with them and started to enslave the "aliens" they found there. This 
went on until they lost a war against some "aliens" . At the present time
the Solomani Civilization in Andromeda consists of several clusters of worlds
separated by alien powers and worlds that decided to secede from the Solomani
Federation and trade with aliens.

Hi there

>Modern republican democracies have proven the most stable means of
>governing modern industrial economies.

No, they haven\'t been disproven, which is different.  The so called
"Communist" governments functioned for decades, and until they fell,
there was no "proof" that they didn\'t work.  When they did collapse,
the apparent corruption and disregard for the people in the system was
as much to blame as the (mis)appropriated tennants.  Before all you
right wingers flame me, I\'d agree that Marx was wrong on many counts,
for example I believe he predicted that the more liberal governments
of western Europe would fall to people\'s revolutions before the more
oppresive ones in eastern Europe.  I\'m just pointing out that there is
no evidence that Modern republican (I live in a non-republican Kingdom
BTW) [capitalist] democracies are the most stable forms of government.
Most nations in history have been governed in other ways.  I believe
that the two oldest democratic republics (France & USA?) have only
been around for 250 years or so (I may well be wrong there, history
not being my strong point).

Sorry to rant so, but when the eastern European governments fell, I
had to listen to my country\'s idiot Prime Minister claim the "death of
socialism" and the "triumph of capitalism" on the eve of a series of
crises which could easily have lead to WW III (and still could)!

Well, yes, but what about Isaac Asimov and Poul Anderson, to name but
two.

A monarchical empire is only one of the possible forms of large scale
interstellar government postulated in Traveller.  The Zhodani have the
democratic consuls, the Solomani have the representation of
nation-states, the First Imperium was run by coalitions of powerful
oligarchs, the Second Imperium by essentially a military junta.  The
Third Imperium claims its form of government is superior, and colours
history to suggest a) its predecessors were more like it than they
truely were and b) their Human competitors are either less successful
(the Solomani) or use distasteful methods (the Zhodani).  Of course,
successful alternate alien forms of government don\'t count, because
they are aliens!

Another reason for a feudal system is that it allows local nobles to

>Has anyone made major changes to the Traveller universe?  Have you 
>scrapped it entirely and played using your own universe?

The last few campaigns I\'ve run, and this covers several years, have
been set during *a* long night.  I refuse to call it *the* long night,
because the future in my games is mutable.

Two of them were in what I guess would be called pocket empires: The
New Terran Empire (NTE) and the Confederation of Acton Systems (CSA). 
The feel is very Classic Traveller, but the scope is smaller.  The
"Nation" the PC\'s belong to, in both cases, is less than a subsector. 
Both are bordered by neighbors ranging from hostile to cautiously
indifferent, and large un-explored areas.

There is true exploration, because the characters (and the players)
have no idea what they will find in systems outside their small home
area.  Their neighbors are known more in story than reality, and
travelling is a constant learning experience. The CSA adventures have
been more mercantile in nature, and the NTE more military oriented.

I\'m going to use the CSA background for a PBEM on the Fido
SF&ANIME_RPG starting this summer.  I\'ll use rules-hidden CT to start
and try to slide into T4 when it comes out.

The other setting I\'ve used recently, I guess ran the first episodes
in \'89, was completely different.  I wanted to put the PC\'s in a
variety of different environments, and to keep them off-balance.

It started with the PC\'s on a hospital ship as patients being carried
in statis.  The PC\'s know *none* of this:  the ship is damaged,
mis-jumps, the crew aboard dies, and the AI travels at sub-light to
the nearest system that its records show has a Navy base.  Now after
several thousands of years the AI awakens the least injured of the
patients, It has been unable to raise anybody at the base on radio, it
needs human assistance to land, and besides it only has another few
weeks of power.

The PC\'s wake, totally disoriented with disjointed memories. They
aren\'t too badly hurt, but they do have injuries that somebody has to
deal with.  They are naked and very confused on an almost dead ship,
with an AI that is already very flakey (no, not Virus this idea
pre-dates Virus), and they\'ve got to figure out what\'s going on.  How
did they get here?  What happened to the ship?  The crew?  The base? 
Where are they..the ship says one thing, but the star charts say
another?  There\'s also a time constraint..waking them up has drained
the ship\'s power, and the other 47 injured patients will die in a
matter of days unless something is done!

I\'ve never been able to play this whole scenario through.  The group I
ran it with spent several sessions on the Hospital ship, and a couple
more exploring the system looking for the Navy base the AI assured
them was there...then the group broke up, and we didn\'t get to do any
more.

I guess my scenarios are generally fairly Traveller-isk.  But my
technology has always been different.  <g> I\'ve never been able to use
*any* official design system..I have to roll my own.

For in system travel I never used thruster plates, or HEPLaR, I use a
drive system based around a screw turning in "hyper-space." It can
accelerate a ship to 10 to 20 million kph almost instantly, with
continued power needed to maintain speed. 

Jumps are handled differently.  A ship can only jump while several AU
away from a star, and only leave jump space very close to a star (or
other massive body). No jumping to empty space, no in system jumps. 
The amount of time in jump space isn\'t fixed, but is *never* less than
4 or 5 days, even for a Jump1, and time in Jump changes based on Tech
level of the equipment.

Engineering, Astrogation, and Piloting skills allow you to *attempt*
jumps greater than the equipment rates.  This means a Jump2 ship with
a *cracker-jack* crew can succeed at Jump3 most of the time and
occasionally at Jump4, but failure is punished severely.  <g> The
quality of sensors and their use (Astrogation), the condition and
tuning of the jump field coils (Engineering), and the skill of the
pilot keeping the ship in the "jump window" until you "go bingo" all
affect how a ship performs.

Computers are *very* low-powered (like CT), with a rational
explanation for their for their large size and slow speed. Conta-grav
technology absolutely wreaks microelectronic devices. Everything
electronic, from sensors to computers, has to be built with vacuum
tube level tech.  Devices are large, hot, and energy hungry.  

As an aside, I had the PC\'s on a diplomatic mission to an alien planet
with advanced technology based on microelectronics.  Just landing
their ship knocked out an entire city, and taking off half the planet! 
<g> Made them an enemy of the NTE...but what could they do..they
couldn\'t get a working weapon within a million miles of an NTE ship.

Agreed.  Actually, I think they always were a tiny niche market.

Well actually, if things go the way they did with RPG\'s we will see 
the end of the craze period, and many of these people will talk 5 years 
from now about how they used to play Magic: The Gathering, kind of 
like people who I talk to now speak about how they used to play 
D&D... :-)

I agree.  My wife actually participates in the Traveller stuff I run, 
and I couldn\'t get her within 50 feet of a wargame.

I agree.  But 1 thing about CCG\'s.  They have dragged a lot of new 
people into the local shops in my area.  None of whom were interested 
in playing Advanced Squad Leader, and none of whom had a whole lot of 
idea what an RPG is or if they did, have misconceptions.  Some of 
these people might be interested in RPG\'s.  I think that the CCG\'s at 
their best, are probably at least as close to RPG\'s as they were to 
wargames.

I just think that the core age of the RPG player is graying a little 
bit, and a little more open attitude (kind of like a venus fly trap) 
about CCG\'s might draw a few players.

I guess what I was trying to say is that a significant number of 
future RPG\'ers could find their way into the hobby initially through 
CCG\'s.  When I bought my original Traveller books, I had no idea what 
it was.  I thought it was some sort of personal combat rules, with a 
spacey background thrown in.  The cover looked interesting, the 
description of the game on the back looked interesting, so I bought 
it.

Good point...

There are several members on Marc Miller\'s staff, including Marc himself 
that have experience designing both CCG\'s and RPG\'s.  If its going to work, 
they\'ll figure it out.  But I\'d have a hard time figuring it out to.

It seems that in the original publication of 2300 and in the early Challenge

were the dominant powers on (and off) Earth, with America being a second 
rate power with just a few offworld potentials.

Is this what was intended?

The second edition (2300AD) and later publications and magazine articles
seemed to focus more on American ascendency, with America poised to take
over the reins over power from France. 

Why the shift? Was it purely for marketting, pandering to American
consumers?

For instance, the way that the NetRunner CCG can be used as part of the
CyberPunk RPG by resolving net runs in the RPG.
Could we use something like Echelons ofd Fury/Fire to resolve ground and

few other CCGs are selling quite well.

That said, the vast majority of CCGs are not.  And many game stores (as

Stores and distributors, while making money hand-over-fist on Magic, often 
lost big when they tried to pick up every CCG on the market.  As the 
bubble starts to burst, I think we\'ll see some stores go down -- and 
there are disturbing rumors about some distributors as well.  (An unusual 
number of them aren\'t paying their bills on time.  By a lot.)  As a 
result, people have become a lot more conservative about getting involved 
with new CCGs.  They\'re a risk.

Would T:tCCG make it on to the shelves?  Perhaps.  It\'s a name well-known 
to people in the field -- but, alas, generally associated of late with 
slow sales of TNE material.  It\'s hard to say, but I really don\'t think 
the market is there.

I\'m also a long-time gamer (started wargaming 20 years ago or so).  One 
strange thing about Magic is that, unlike D&D, it may not spawn a whole 
new hobby.  After buying the D&D books, you could still *afford* 
Traveller, C&S, Runequest, and the rest.  If you\'re seriously involved in 
Magic, it\'s difficult to support other CCG habits properly...

What did the players do in this setting?  Did they travel between planets 
much, or was it mostly concentrated on a single world or in a single 
solar system?  In other words, what was the flavor of you campaign?

And, perhaps more importatly, did the Traveller system help you in 
running this campaign, or did you end up changing a lot of rules?

The Traveller system originally claimed to be for use in any sci-fi 
setting, but of course they only developed one: the Imperium.  I don\'t 
regret any of my Traveller campaigns, but sometimes I wanted to run at 
least a few sessions in a setting like Piers Anthony\'s "Cluster" series.  
But, the players enjoyed the Imperium setting enough that they never 
wanted to experiment with another.

This is very similar to the premise behind the "Exordium" series of books by 
Sherwood Smith and Dave Trowbridge.  A number of people escaped from an AI 
rebellion/war through some sort of wormhole to a distant part of the galaxy 
(or maybe a different galaxy, I\'m not sure the books specified), where they 
set up a very Imperium-like government.  This is a _great_ series of books 
which would make a wonderful RPG setting -- I hope Steve Jackson decides to do 
it for GURPS at the very least.

The series consists of (so far) The Phoenix in Flight, Ruler of Naught, A 
Prison Unsought, and The Rifter\'s Covenant.

The Albedo RPG uses jumps like this -- its salient features are:
** the ship has to push off a gravity well to get any significant range;
** if you try to jump in system, it will "push you halfway to the next star";
** you can jump from empty space, but the jumps are very short;
** gravity wells also pop you out of jumpspace at your destination, so aim
   carefully;
** the length of jumps is limited because ships can only remain in jumpspace
   for a few seconds, because once the ship becomes stabilized in jumpspace
   anything with an atomic number higher than carbon has a tendency to
   spontaneously fission;
** if you jump too close to a gravity well, you have a tendecy to "leave
   particles behind", resulting in anything from detectable subatomic erosion
   through the complete destruction of the ship.

Very cool system, first published in _Vortex_, later added to either Albedo 2e 
or the Albedo Ship Construction Manual.

Reminds me of a story I read where the limiting factor was that you couldn\'t 
shed any excess heat during FTL travel.  This worked out well for the 
protagonists, who were pure humans in a culture increasing dominated by 
cyborgs.

This is the type of campaign my fiancee would love.  We\'ve tried the 
Imperium a few times, but the setting seems rather bland to her.  She is 
interested mostly in doing world exploration with little combat.

Sounds like /I/ would like adventures in the CSA. :)  I\'ve never been 
able to find a group to run a mercantile campaign in. 

Your setting seems very well developed.  Did you develop most of it prior 
to the first adventure, or did you make it up as you went along (ie, 
between sessions or (my favorite) during the sessions)?

Ooh.  You have all the elements of an archetypical Traveller scenario.

Frustrating.  I\'ve never had that happen, fortunately.  Have you ever

I like that..."go bingo"...I love it when gaming groups come up with

Do you have them frequently replacing tubes, or has the problem of tube

Huh?  The NTE couldn\'t get a working weapon within a million miles of the 
PC\'s ship is what you meant, right?  Or did I not understand the whole 
technology/artifical gravity interaction?

True.  My best friend and I tried several wargames and got rapidly bored 
with the required attention to minutia.  Then we bought some 
computer-based wargames by SSI and Microprose (back in the good ol\' 8-bit 
computer days, BTW) and fell in love with them.  Decision in the Desert 
by Microprose is still on of my favorite computer games.  Since I didn\'t 
have to do all those calculations and rules-references myself, I could 
just enjoy the strategy aspect of the game.  I wish the great GDW games 
had come out on computer.  Maybe Marc Miller will someday translate 
his own wargames for us. :)

Maybe someday RPG\'s will be best played on computers.  Nah. :)

And 10 years after /that/, those same people will be desparately buying

This is a good point, and I hadn\'t thought about it much.  For some 
reason, I keep associating CCGs with comic book stores and more 
generalized games stores (ie, the ones that sell Parker Brothers games, 
puzzles, etc. and have a small selection of RPGs sort of thrown in).  
You\'re right, considering that CCGs are sold in the same places that RPGs 
are, there is the potential for crossover.

And you\'ve regretted it ever since, right? :P  Seriously, it\'s 
interesting how we get into these things on rather haphazard basis, yet 
they affect our lives so greatly.  No warning.  You just happen to pick 
up a game because it looks interesting (even though you have the wrong 
idea about it), and then it starts taking over your life.  
Hey, that sounds like a good sci-fi scenario! :)

Oh!  I didn\'t know that.  Well, then I\'ll have high hopes for whatever 
CCG (if any) comes out of the IG workshop.

Just two:

1) It could be simply attributed to anti-CCG prejudice on my part, but I 
rather dislike the idea of using cards in an RPG.

2) On the other hand, this is the first clear upgrade path I\'ve heard of, 
so if no other emerges it may indeed be the way to go.  I guess what I am 
saying is that there may be no way to both keep the two systems apart AND 
provide a clear upgrade path.

Good point!

This is a scary time for several industries, all of which are tied 
together.  Marvel pulled out of the normal distribution network and 
created its own, which made things harder on the comic shop owners.  
Generally, the comics industry is now doing worse and worse for a variety 
of reasons (best discussed elsewhere, I know).  Comics shops generally 
also carry CCGs and RPGs.  Since many shops went out onto a limb buying 
CCGs just before the market started to decline, this put another strain 
on those shops, as you said.  All of this affects the distribution of 
RPGs in comic shops (which, of course, are far more numerous than RPG 
stores, although they carry a smaller selection of RPGs).  This, in 
turn, can cause (has caused?) a downturn in the RPG industry.

Again, good point.  It might get onto the shelves, but it would almost 
certanly be buried by the huge M:TG marketing machine.

That\'s true.  In the early RPG days, most of the people I knew - even the 
ones who were D&D die-hards - owned a few other games.  If this isn\'t 
happening in the CCG world, it could certainly make the whole thing turn 
out to be a fad.  Or, something like the Rubik\'s Cube - sure, there are 
still such puzzles sold (mostly permutations of the original cube), but 
it\'s not a craze of any sort as it was in the early years.

Food for thought.  Thanks for posting it.

I suppose the safest course would be to do as has been said before, and 
find a way to welcome CCGers to the RPG world - without releasing a 
Traveller CCG.  Get them hooked on a better drug, in other words. ;)

I don\'t know that I would call America a second-rate power in 2300AD. True,
the US wasn\'t as pre-eminent as it is today (or the past 50 or so years),
but in the multipolar world of 2300AD it was certainly in the top 5. The
three arms of space explored by humanity were the Chinese, American, and
French.

France\'s arms of space, which the Germans had followed, was the most
plentiful resource-wise. The trouble the French had was those pesk Kafer
appearing at the end of the line. For some reason GDW put a Texan colony
there too, which made no since to me except as "flavor".

China had a fairly dead area of space. As I recall, their trouble mostly
was pilots. They also had the worlds of the oldest alien civilization (the
Eber, I believe). Never got into the Chinese arm too much.

The American problem is that they had a dead *end* in space. Using the FTL
technology in the game, the American arm couldn\'t push any further.

France\'s ascendancy stems from the fact that 2300 was in the same
chronology as Twlight:2000. France stayed out of the war, secured the Rhine
as a natural border, and was not quite as bad off as the rest of the
once-civilized world.

I\'d say part of it was due to maret pandering, but there were canonical
reasons as well. By the 24th century America was finally recovering the
power and prestige it once had. The French were slacking off a bit after
about a hundred years of primacy, and during the Kafer war Britain and
American were both helping to bail out the French.

This goes back to my point about the CCG market being saturated a few

Actually IG is going to have an uphill battle just getting them to 
stock Traveller books and supplements.  Hate to say it, but since 
MegaTraveller (can you say Megaton bomb), a couple of the local shops 
are reluctant to stock too much of anything with the Traveller name.  
Ken, Marc & company are going to have to do a lot to break down 
resistance at the distributor and local level to have much success.  

I think a lot of the anti-Traveller hostility was probably more aimed 
at GDW, but it will still be an uphill battle.  If we want this thing 
to have a serious chance, we will have to make our feelings known at 
the local level.

are on.  I have two questions about the Animal Weight Effects table
described on page 35 of the MT Referee\'s Manual.

1. What the heck is the Wounds column for?  The description of 
   the table (page 30) talks about the Wound Modifier column,
   which is basically the effect of size on the weapon\'s damage.
   So, if I have a 1600 kg creature that has claws as a weapon,
   the hits it inflicts will be 2 + 2D.  So why is there a
   Wounds column?

2. Combatants generally have two "damage" values which are derived
   from their life force.  The first is the number of hits to
   unconsciousness and the second is the number of hits to death
   once the combatant is unconscious.

   In the Animal Weight Effects table, there is a Hits column which,
   according to the description on page 30, "indicates the number of
   hits an animal can take".  Fine.  It then goes on to say

	When an animal has received wounds equaling (sic) or 
	exceeding the first number, the animal is unconscious.  When
	it has received wounds equaling (sic) or exceeding the
	second number, it is dead.

   What second number?  Is this the purpose of the Wounds column?
   If so, that column is incorrectly named.

Your advice is appreciated.

There were several types of games. First of all, there was usually a task
on planet to complete followed by a few planetary jumps. 

There was one game which was primarily a mercenary game. While the Solomani
were putting all of their forces towards fighting the war with the aliens, 
the Solomani and megacorps needed more troops to put down rebellions and
protect their interests. This game took place during the war. 

The postwar games became more interesting for a few reasons: 
	1. The solomani never saw the enemy. The enemy just stopped attacking
	after awhile and placed ships in orbit of planets they wanted, 
	water worlds. So there were some games when players tried to rescue
	persons/resources from water worlds without being noticed. Some 
	players tried to develop some form of methods for getting past alien
	ships. Some were successful. 

	2. Many planets/megacorps stopped supporting the Human Superiority 
	theory and broke away from the Federation. There was a merchant 
	campaign based on trading between the newly independent worlds. One 
	long running plot in this game was when the players got involved in 
	an attempt to set up a trading post deep in the frontier. 

	3. Another campaign that I ran in this scenario when I could not 
	think of something else was to find the "Andromeda" the oldest and
	last remaining Galaxy Jumper which was rumoured to be seen in orbit 
	of "X". 

As for your second question, the rules. 

Classic Traveller was useful for doing this for several reasons. First of
all, it provided a norm for players to go by. This was the rules by which 
the Solomani did things etc. This allowed me to create a truly alien effect
when they ran into things like Energy Transport and disintegrators. 

I thought the Trade Rules however were rather dry in that the boiled it 
all down to rolls instead of role play. 

Megatraveller made my job alot harder because it seemed harder to extract
Imperium out of the rules.

True.  I\'m glad they are going back to a separation between the rules and 
the setting.  I think the ultimate Traveller rules presentation was the 
Traveller Book.  If IG comes out with something like that (minus the info 
on the Imperium, preferably), it will be a winner.  I think clearly 
distinguishing between the rules and the setting is something that has 
been lost in RPGs of late.  Every RPG I look at has a single book with 
the setting intermingled with the rules, so that the GM is almost forced 
to use the official setting.  I\'d like to see a move away from that.

	As a long time lurker on both lists who has enjoyed many flavors
of Traveller over the years, I would like to put my ten cents into this.
I have run several successful campaigns in a variety of settings, some
"canonical" (how I am growing to loathe that term), some based on works of
fiction or movies, and some of my own creation.
	I have always stuck to the core combat and skill rules of CT, with
some custom enhancements over the years.  I stress roleplaying and a rich
background over detailed combat and fleet operations (though those have
occurred aplenty too at times).  What I find interesting in designing an
alternate campaign setting is how the choice of technology implementations
and the rules thereof (jump drives and their restrictions, communication
means, etc)effects the history and culture of a campaign.
	Traveller is an excellent game, and the Imperium future-history is
a well documented and richly detailed campaign setting.  With some
variation on the technologies though alternate settings can easily be
given a very unique flavor.  Take the example given before where jumps
*always* take a variable amount of time.  If I read that right, the
implications for large scale fleet actions are dramatic.  It would be much
harder, if not impossible, to sychronize large scale surprise attacks.
With a window of days in which all the ships in a given fleet would arrive
in a target system, it gives the defenders a great advantage in repelling
the first waves of an attack.
	Alternate means of FTL communication in non Imperium settings can
be interesting as well.  For example, in a culture where psionics flourish
perhaps a means of interstellar telepathy could enable people to send
messages faster than jumps could travel.  This would in turn create the
potential for a powerful social class of psions, with variable
implications based on other campaign factors.  Another example of psion
dependance could be ala Herbert\'s _Dune_, where psionic navigators are
required in order for jumps to operate.
	The point is , Traveller is at its heart such a playable, simple
gaming system that with some forethought and a little imagination, a huge
variety of alternate settings can be created should one so choose.
	That being said, give me a suped up Type S scout, a small pension,
and a laser rifle anyday, exploring the frontiers of "canonical" Imperial
space ;-)  I\'ve had alot of fun with some alternate universe settings, but
the best has always been the original for me.

Miller.  In addition to sending it to Ken for the interview, I\'m sending 
it to the xboat list to get reaction from my fellow Travellers:

Will T4 include provisions for solitaire play, as did CT?  Not only 
tables and charts, but an explicit statement (as was included in all the 
CT versions) that Traveller is suitable for solo play - and the necessary 
game-mechanics follow-through on that.


I was just sitting at my RPG table, rolling up characters, and realized 
how much I use Traveller on a solitaire basis.  I essentially do all the 
things the Traveller Book suggests a referee do: create characters, 
generate worlds, make starships and small craft, engage in trade, engage 
in personal combat, engage in starship combat, etc.  I also detail 
cultures and worlds using DGP\'s "Grand Census" and "Grand Survey."  

I\'d really like to see T4 continue this ability for solitaire play.  
Sure, you can do combat and character generation in /any/ RPG system.  
But the variety of things Traveller provides systems for allows for a 
much broader solo experience.  And, it\'s very satisfying, IMO.  Nothing 
like having a group of players, but it certainly is wortwhile when that 
is not possible.

Does anyone else enjoy the solo aspects of Traveller?

Did you do all these with a single group, or did each group of players 
stick to a single setting throughout your relationship with them?

	Yes!  Thinking it through, in other words.  You don\'t just put a 
gadget in there because it is neat (or leave something out for a 
similarly silly reason).  You explain why it is there,and you think about 
the effect it will have on the society and the course of history.  
Excellent!

	Exactly.  I hope IG continues this simplicity and playability.  
While CT grew from three little black books to a multitude of products by 
many authors and companies, the core rules always retained the original 
simiplicity.  Even The Traveller Book, the most complete set of CT rules, 
really contains little more than the three black books and some 
supplementary notes on how to play the game (including some adventures 
and detail on the Imperium setting).  The core rules were simple and 
short.  That is the way an RPG should be.  Simplicity at the core, with 
expanding complexity as the GM and players demand it.  That pleases 
everyone, and makes for a rich gaming experience.

Sounds good, but I\'d prefer a subsidized trader and good friends at my 
side, plying the space lanes in search of the big score. :)

1) The CCG market is *flooded* with games.  Try convincing a distributor
or retailer to sink money into *yet another* "new CCG" that will sit on
his shelves taking up valuable space and not turning around as fast as
MTG.  If you can\'t get your product to the distributors and retailers,
you\'re out of business.  

2) Illuminati (by Steve Jackson Games) is a classic game of conspiracy
(just as Traveller is a classic RPG of science fiction).  Yet, Illuminati:
New World Order (INWO), their CCG version of Illuminati, isn\'t moving
worth beans, from what I can see.  (Don\'t get me wrong; I love INWO.  It\'s
a damn fine CCG.)  Every time I check my mail, I get another catalog for a
store that sells singles on the CCG after-market, and they\'re selling INWO
at a discount!  Just because Traveller is a good RPG doesn\'t mean that a
Traveller CCG will sell.  

3) I doubt IG has the financial strength, at this time, to adequately
support T4 (the RPG) with regular supplements *and* do a Trav:CCG.  Maybe
in a couple of years, once they get off the ground and running, but not
now.  In that case, I, as a long-time fan of the Traveller line, would
rather see a strong support of T4, and *maybe* a Trav:CCG in a few years.

No, I did not replace it with a system. I simply figured out what was
needed on different worlds and roleplayed the trading. As a DM one of the 
fun things is playing different personalities and having the players do 
it to. 

I used some of the trade rules to determine availability of goods and 
so forth, but the players had to roleplay rather than just roll against
broker skills.

Unfortunately Challenge went the way of GDW with issue 77 being its last

I\'ve always explained the coexistence of Liberal forms of government at the
local level and feudalism at the interstellar by imagining the Imperium as
a customs union with a navy. The Imperium has no direct jurisdiction over
most planets; it merely provides a set of rules for trade, defense against
outside threats, and a common currency. In exchange, it imposes relatively

As I mentioned before, I never got the chance to run much of a trading 
game, as my players were interested in other things.  But, I did much the 
same thing as you whenever the players puchased equipment.  

For instance, Stacy\'s Outfitters was a favorite store in one campaign.  
She could get lots of things that weren\'t commonly available, but never 
on special order.  She just had what she had when you went in, and you 
never knew in advance that that might be, aside from the general 
selection that was always there.  

And, Stacy would dicker over the price of special items, while holding 
sales on some of the normal stock.  Depending on whether she knew the 
players needed something badly (and her mood!), the players might get a 
good deal, or they might walk out with a new item...but not the shirt on 
their backs. :)

Eventually, Stacy grew to such importance that she became the focus of an 
adventure, wherein suddenly her store was gone, and in its place was 
"Nunzio\'s Pawn Shop."  The players took it upon themselves to find out 
what happened to her, and to help her regain her business.  It was a lot 
of fun for me, too. :)

I never liked the idea of players grabbing the rule book and picking the 
equipment they purchase, using list prices.  Doing it the real way was 
much more fun.

Man!  You two just gave me such a rush. <g>  

How about a compromise?  A bunch of layed off ex-somebodies in an old
Far Trader, exploring beyond the frontier.  Trying to keep up with the
payments, half expecting to have to skip every quarter, while looking
for new worlds, new markets, new adventures...and some fun!

That sounds like the same method I use.  Making up a lot of detail in 
advance never appealed to me nor to my players.  Yet, a total lack of 
preparation doesn\'t work very well either. :)  Usually, I\'d do what you 
outline above, then between sessions I would make some notes as to what 
new things are going to happen, what things will build on past 
occurances, etc. - but nothing too detailed.  Just something like "NPC 
Jim is still mad at Scardin, and has decided to do something to get back 
at him."

Maps of cities, starports, and buildings were almost all done on-the-fly, 
while the larger maps (nations and worlds) were done before-hand.

Heh.  A friend of mine played in a campaign wherein the PC\'s wanted a 
ship really bad, but didn\'t have the cash.  The ref designed a ship 
using what amounted to a lawmower motor (with pull-string and all) that 
was very prone to breakdowns.  He enjoyed that campaign a lot.  I 
remember him telling me about a ship coming after them, and his character 
is desparately pulling on the starter cord, trying to get the damned 
thing to turn over. :)  Anachronistic, sure, but fun nonetheless.

Comic relief is important when dealing with the heavy subjects.  From 
complete light-hearted scenarios such as you outline above, to little 
strokes of humor in otherwise serious situations (such as one powerful 
and ruthless enemy the players had, whose name was "Richard Hedd, but 
don\'t call him Dick." :P

Has anyone else had successful comic Traveller scenarios?  Want to tell 
us about them?

	Okay, usually I would be the last person to defend CCGs, but I
wonder if it would not be a good way to bring in some money which would
support the RPG side of things?  That\'s the way I see it:  a sideline to
make some money to support the important stuff :-).  Others have expressed
fears that the CCG would lose money, but I have to wonder how much it
costs to develop a CCG.  Aren\'t they cheap enough to produce that even
modest sales bring returns?  I thought that was the reason for the CCG
craze in the first place: low overhead.  Of course, I\'m speaking from a
position of zero experience here, so feel free to correct me.  It\'s just
that I can\'t see them taking that much time in terms of rules design,
playtesting and so on (though the artwork might take a while). 

What do y\'all think?

Some of each.  I have been playing Traveller since 78, and over the last
18 years have played with several groups and individuals.  I actually have
one campaign that is essentially 17 years old, a "canonical" one.

I have seen the end result of campaigns that lack such forethought.  The
implications of historical events and core technologies are what decide
the flavor of a given universe.

Here is a brief example of an alternate campaign setting that proved to be
popular:

Jump technology consisted of linear FTL travel, not a "jump" per se.  The
technology was gained from the 1947 crash of a UFO in Roswell, New Mexico
(I know I know, and just think, I came up with this *years* before
conspiracy theorism became popular!).  My campaign started in the year
2090, and humanity was (semi) unitied and had colonized about two dozen
nearby worlds.  They are at war with the aliens, who had wanted to
colonize earth but didn\'t act fast enough, undestimating our ability to
duplicate their technology.  The aliens (known as \'Bug Eyes\' colloquially)
were not prepared for war, having never had to fight another species of
even close to their technology.

Ships in transit at FTL speeds can be detected via standard sensors.
Typical speeds are from .5 to 1.5 light years per day.  Most ships in this
campaign are small (under 2000 ton), at least the terrans.  The aliens had
much better power sources so could field larger ships (aka "motherships").
Speeds fall into "bands" in .5 ly/day increments, so courses can be
matched at FTL speeds.

FTL Communication was fixed at 1.5 ly/day unless a message was taken in
the fastest of ships (2.5 ly/day).

Maneuver drives were thruster plate type drives.

Terrans did not initially have full anti gravity, but it was fully
developed early in the campaign by ambitious PC\'s.

Typical weapons for the terrans were particle beams and lasers, for the
aliens neutral particle beams and phased energy beams (yes, phasers, ok, I
was 16 when  I did this).  Missiles were used only by terrans and were
thermonuclear in nature.  Fighters used mass drivers, with the larger ones
sporting lasers.

Anyways, this campaign went on over about 100 years of campaign time, with
three sets of characters (same players).  It culminated with the discovery
of force field technology, the technology for which was stolen by the PC\'s
and helped tip the balance and force a truce.  It had a unique flavor, not
quite Traveller but still with that same hard edge that I have come to
like from "canonical" traveller.  Communication and travel were just
different enough to give the universe a whole different dynamic.

Thanks,

Actually, I play Hero System (the only other RPG I play anymore).  But I 
prefer Traveller, and hope they do what I suggested. :)

Wow.  That 17-year-old campaign, if it is with the same group of players 
it started with, must be some sort of record!

Man, that sounds like quite an epic campaign.  I love hearing about the 
creative ideas people come up with.  

I never had a single campaign nearly as long as that.  The longest 
campaign in terms of hours played must have been somewhere around 200 
hours (done over a two-week period in the summer after 9th grade, playing 
every day for most of the day).  Traveller campaigns done in weekly 
sessions lasted for a few months, for the most part.

Only one original player due to geographic changes.  My brother has some
ten year old+ characters still in that campaign.

It definitly had an epic flavor, the terrans were basically fighting to
survive, to avoid extinction.  I like hearing about other\'s ideas too, and
it is better once in awhile than constant bickering over what is canon or
not 8->

Maybe, but probably somene will use this form of storage for "multimedia

Has anyone ever consireded the prices of everyday wares in Traveller? I 
have MT and TN, and they both list very accurately the cost of a lid of a 
bullet clip, but nowhere is any reference to normal food, clothes etc. 
This amazes me, because almost every fantasy game I have played lists 
these things ... perhaps they have food automats at every corner in 
Traveller..

Well, I shall be the first to admit that the MT animal encounter tables =
are a little unpenetrable. With a little work and the help from some TD =
Q&As I have managed to make the tables make sense to me, though.

The hits column is how many hits the animal can take before it goes =
unconciuos. The wounds column is how many _additional_ hits it can take =
before it dies. The wound modifier column is a modifier for how much =
_damage_ the animal gives. Remember that base damage is determined in =
the Animal Weaponry table (Table 8).

Subject: One more alternate setting...

How\'s this for a campaign setting:
(tongue in cheek mode entered)

Seven people take a yacht (Type Y) on what is ostensibly a 3 hour tour of
the system.  Well, the ion storms started getting rough, the tiny ship was
tossed.  Heck, if not for the courage of its fearless crew it\'d probably
have been lost.

Anyways, the yacht crashes on a remote planet in the system, and the PC\'s
have to survive with whatever they can get their hands on.  The planets
one saving grace is these strange, round, wooklike fruits that can be made
into paddles, electrical generators, just about anything, by the
Scientist.

The other PC\'s would include a merchant captain, his first mate, and
entertainment star, a Noble and his wife, and a downhome girl from the
homeworld.  They would have to fight to survive while awaiting rescue.

I won\'t vouch for this 100%, as I haven\'t actually seen the article, but a
friend of mine who has a *very* large collection of Traveller stuff swears that
he saw (*somewhere*) a comment to the effect that it came from the Julian
Protectorate (the large state off to the northeast of all those maps of the
Imperium). Until Marc answers, perhaps that will do?

It is one half of Double Adventure 1.  It was the first Traveller mini-adventure.  Originaly published in Journal of the Travellers Aid Society (JTAS #1 -- I think), it is the story of a group of adventurers discovering a very alien ship that had been popping up in places and disappering.  However
it appears that no one is aboard.

It is a classic....

Well, this wasn\'t anything so complete as a scenario, but a few weeks
back when I was feeling uninspired as to what to hit the PCs with at
the next port of call, I decided to play out their interaction with
their passengers to a greater extent than I would usually.  The
passengers were a Marine Captain, a Computer Consultant, and a
travelling Crenduthaar (the big, ugly race from one of the MT
Digests).  The Marine Captain was a successful free-lance mercenary
and security consultant, and she found the Crendu fascinating, while
Mr Computer Specialist was rather tedious, and prone to getting drunk.
Also, he found the Crendu (who called himself Indiana) terrifying.  Oh
yes, also onboard were some Anolas (ship\'s pets) and a Vargr
crewmember (the Crendu have a pathalogical hate of Vargr).  While
nothing very specific happened, I played Indiana loud and funny
(modelled on the guy in the office next to mine, as it happens), and
generally had fun confusing the crew, soaking the steward in drinks,
driving the Vargr into a foaming fit, and demonstrating some of the
Anola\'s powers.  The result was a few hours role playing with very
little preparation from me, and lots of fun on all sides.

We had a game once where one of the players rolled until he got a character
whos UPP was: 23248C (or something similar).  He had gone through Navy Medical and ended up an admrial doctor/surgon type.  His last name was "Toehead"  The player took him through like 8 terms until the stats were that low.  Needless to say, he played the bumbling oaf type (similar to General Half-track from Beetle Bailey).  His quest in life was to seek out "Live Terran Crustations"  (Maine Lobsters).   It offered us quite a bit of comic relief at times.

We had another campaign with a Sgt. Gordon Chumway (of ALF fame).  During his Army career, he had spent quite a bit of time in the Army Hosptial and detested white walls.  Many credits were spent on spray paint, and legal fees.

  world out there, and I went exploring.  I found these neat things
  called "bookstores" and "malls", as well as stopping in at the
  Compleat Strategist on 33d St. in NYC.

  Compleat Strategist _wants_ to carry T4.  They want promo
  material as soon as possible. (Hey, Ken!  Is IG listening?)  They
  _like_ Traveller, even though they give CyberPunk 2020 and GURPS
  and AD&D _each_ about three times the shelf space that Traveller
  has ever had. But then, with GDW not supporting the system,
  they\'d\'ve had to order a 20-year supply of each item to have
  enough stock to match any of the above.  There\'s good and bad to
  it...

  However:  Several comic shops in the malls, and most of the
  bookstores, had at least one shelf for RPG stuff, and most had
  more.  So did the toy stores.  But, y\'know, the only game I saw
  on those shelves was AD&D.  Maybe part of Traveller\'s problem has
  been _exposure_?  Or, more accurately, the lack thereof?

  Maybe IG should try to put Traveller right next to AD&D in Barnes
  and Noble.  Or in Squiggy\'s Cards and Comix.

  Maybe buying a "spot" during Star Trek/ST:TNG/ST:DS9/ST:V and/or
  during Babylon 5 or during SeaQuest:DSV (if it\'s still on) or
  during Sliders (ditto) or... would be a good idea as well.  Maybe
  space in Asimov\'s would also be a good idea.

  Heck, there are companies that think of these things for money,
  and they probably do a better job than I would.  But there
  shouldn\'t be any question of what I\'m trying to get at.  And
  now\'s the time to start - certainly not _after_ the release, and
  not only in the few days before the release.  There are a lot of
  gamers, and a lot of potential gamers out there - and most of
  them would say "Huh?" if you said "Traveller".  Don\'t you think
  that needs to be changed?

1.	IN DEFENCE OF THAT NILSEN GUY

Stu said that Dave Nilsen\'s writing style "sacrificed info in favour of ...
very
bad humour".

I don\'t disagree that some of his humour was poor ("Starship", "San Claus",
et
al). However, I believe that he totally sacrificed information. Look at the
Darrian alien module - huge tracts of open whitespace, plenty of room for 
(at
least) pictures, or (at most) more info!! Crumbs, DM, they could at least
have
given us a few pics of flame sculptures or Darrian floating cities or a
world
map - we don\'t even have that!

In contrast, look at all the info packed into Survival Margin and the
Regency
Sourcebook. The latter, in particular, is one of the most scholarly works
produced by the Workshop. Even though I\'m not playing in the RC, it contains
data that i will be using in my 1101-1120 campaign, simply because it gives
me adventure ideas and because it brings so much information together into
one place.

Also, if Dave really is the one person who knows the most about
inconsistencies
within CT/MT, then he really should be consulted about re-released
*backgrounds*.

2.	TRAVELLER CCG

I wouldn\'t mind seeing a CCG that can be used to resolve space combat, if
you
wanted it resolved quickly without going to Mayday or Brilliant Lances.

3.	T4

>From Ken:
>I feel that T4 should be the internet abbreveation. However this is not
>cannon, only my sugestion.
 ^^^^^^
Oh, Ken, If only you knew what battles have been fought over that little
word!
[BTW, I repeat that this is the best reason to get Dave Nilsen on the team,
if he really knows about all the inconsistencies within "canon"].

And if you think there are none, let me remind you of:
   a. jump torps
   b. Annic Nova
   c. Black globes used to power jump drives (from HG)
   d. How The Solomani Won The War
et al...

4.	2300

In reply to the US "arm" being a dead-end, a number of _Challenge_ articles
opened the arm up using brown dwarfs and stutterwarp tugs.

5.	HOUSEKEEPING

Just a plea from someone who only has a 1200-baud modem (currently):
For those of you who insist on quoting other people\'s entire paragraphs, and
then adding only one or two sentences (or even only one or two WORDS, good
grief!) - PLEASE DON\'T! Those of us (the majority) who follow the threads
through KNOW what they are about. Only quote the relevant bit - the sentence
,
one or two sentences, whatever - cut any irrelevant stuff in-between.
It\'s easier to read, not to mention easier on the bandwidth (and I believe
that
some on this list have to pay for EVERY byte they download!!)

6.	COMPILED MARCHES DATA

Glenn M. Goffin) said:
>I have been working recently on compiling all of the published information
on
>the Spinward Marches (up to about Third Imperium Year 1120) into one
database..

Wow, a BIG project. I recognise the Efate planet names from _The Zhodani
Conspiracy_ - now that\'s scholarship to trawl through the computer games as
well!

BTW, the Regency Sourcebook is actually a good reference source for any era,
as
it contains the cross-reference listings for all the old data it draws upon.
For
example, I don\'t have JTAS 1-7 (only the "Best of.."), but the data for
Victoria
(Lanth/Spinward Marches 1817) is included in the Sourcebook. The reference
says
it came from JTAS 2, currently out of print.

Can you post the references you have so far to me? (I\'d ask for the data,
too,
but that would breach copyright ;-). Have you suggested to Marc that you
could
help them to compile a full on-line reference for the Marches?

I have posted an article on GURPS Traveller.  It\'s available at...
ftp://ftp.io.com/pub/GURPSnet/Worlds/Traveller/TravellerII.txt)
and...
ftp://ftp.mpgn.com/Gaming/GURPS/GURPS.Trav.2

Hero would work to though (aside from my preference for GURPS) I
think GURPS realism fits a bit better to Traveller.

Subject: Shipboard combat
Message-ID: <01BB344B.F79D66E0@Mark.dk-online.dk>

All this talk about shipboard combat has made me think of something. =
When I first started playing Traveller/MegaTraveller, I read in the =
rules that some high penetration weapons were rarely used inside =
spaceships, as the risk of penetrating the hull was too high. Well, you =
all know that.

But take a look at the MegaTraveller rules: The Players\' Manual (p. 93) =
states a Starship Interior Bulkhead as having an armor value of 40, and =
a Starship Exterior Hull an armor value of 60! Clearly, no personal =
weapon listed in the Weapons section can penetrate that - not even the =
FGMPs, Grenade Launchers or Recoilless Rifles.

Off course you still have the problem with ricochetting bullets, but =
sometimes you may even want that - imagine firing burst fire at the wall =
behind an enemy under cover. If he\'s down a corridor or something (a =
rather reasonable situation in shipboard combat) you can do this =
relatively safely and he just might get hit by the ricochet.

And if you don\'t want ricochets, you can just fire lasers or other =
energy weapons - they don\'t ricochet.

Off course you still run the risk of damaging valuable equipment =
including power plant, bridge, jump drive and so on. But that\'s an other =
story.

Well, I\'m certainly not going to tell them they can\'t! There\'s a Ghurka

guys (probably about 5\'6" average) but they look tough as hell when you pass
them in town (and smart with it, blazers and smart pants as a rule). As for the
Khukri being ugly, it\'s probably a matter of perspective. It\'s still part of
their official equipment and if they\'ve got them they\'ll use them (I believe
they used them in the Falklands).

Again, a lot of it was rehashes of material.  However, I will grant 
you that RSB packed in a lot of information.  In fact if anything,

I just have to reply to Jerry Alexandratos, and this isn\'t a flame,
and I agree completely with his comments amounting to "if you don\'t
like it, change it", but you have to get your facts right!

>In CT, I don\'t ever remember seeing a 100 ton limit, as far as I know,
>it was added in MT.

Well, I couldn\'t give you a page number, but it was in the rules, it
was in the supplements (Traders & Gunboats, or Library Data N-Z, to
name but two), and I think it affected standard ship designs, such as
the xboat, and the Scout/Courier (the deckplans for both of which are
no where near displacement 100) which would have been more feasible if
they were smaller.

>And fuel use.  We do all know that you use all your jump fuel whether
>you jump the full capacity of your drive or partial capacity.

I\'m not at all clear that there was any such rule in CT, or in MT for
that matter; I have a feeling that FF&S was the first place to mention
fuel use as a function of jump range, etc.  Of course, this is me
being hazy on my facts now!

Just to reiterate, I support the gist of Jerry\'s post, I\'m just
pedantic.  I\'m probably a terminal anti-Canonmonger (see

Wizards of the Coast have been producing Magic for two or three years now. 
Loathe it or Hate it, it is the most widely sold CCG out. This didn\'t stop 
them cutting all their RPG lines (including Everway, which had only been 
published a month or so) in December of last year.

However you view their business decision though, a potential T4 CCG 
(Traveller: The Gathering? :-) ) would not only be competing with MTG, but 
with approximately 180 further card games - many of which are barely 
playable (and only a few are playable without a large cash outlay).

For this reason, no matter how good or playable a T4 CCG was, I cannot see 
how it would help the production or survivability of Traveller.

>  I have to wonder how much it costs to develop a CCG.  Aren\'t they cheap

I don\'t know how much it costs to develop a CCG, but I do know that WoTC had 
to loan or gift a large amount of cash to Steve Jackson Games to get Mythos 
out (of course, Mythos is playable!).

>  I thought that was the reason for the CCG craze in the first place: low 
overhead.

According to Richard Garfield in a recent interview with Arcane magazine in 
the UK (the infamous "...Wizards don\'t want to kill roleplaying.." interview 
 - which was published the same week that WoTC dropped their RPG lines), he 
designed Magic because he was a big fan of collectible cards (which are 
apparently big business in the US) and he had thousands of cards which did 
nothing but look nice. He claims to have been pleasantly surprised by the 
surge of interest in MTG.

Everybody else got on the bandwagon because it appeared from WoTC\'s success 
to be a licence to print cash.

> It\'s just that I can\'t see them taking that much time in terms of rules 
design,
> playtesting and so on (though the artwork might take a while).

I can think of half a dozen CCG\'s where playtesting appears to have been 
left to the buyer to do! The sad thing is that there are some very good card 
games on the market, but they are swamped by the majority which should never 
have been printed. Next time you go in to your games store, see how long it 
takes you to spot a decent, playable CCG on the display.

My main problem with CCG\'s has always been the amount of money you have to 
spend to get a playable deck. If I wanted to buy a game which was unplayable 
until I had bought an unspecified number of supplements (or boosters in this 
case), I would have bought TORG.

To IG: If you make a T4 CCG, for God\'s sake make sure that it is:

     a) playable
     b) playable straight from the box

Have the CCG be aimed at planetary/interstellar politics. Including
Clausewitz\'s "diplomacy by other means" (ie war).

It\'d give a nice, semi-abstract way of playing out political
interactions, and thus giving refs a way to take a bunch of generated
worlds and turn them into a bunch of territories, complete with a
"history" of deals, wars, etc.

Heck, handled right it might even work the way some gaming groups used
to do things. They\'d use some "grand strategic" type rules to generate
the conflicts and find out *where* the battles were going to be. Then
they\'d use tactical level rules to fight out the battles. 

As I\'ve noted before, I\'m in favor of having the rules set up such that
you can handle things at any desired level of complexity and get
"equivalent" results. 

So if a CCG would work for the highest level, what the heck.

    'body' => 'Not rules per se, just a background item.  Originally used for a campaign 
based on Glisten.

At the Glisten Ballet (1107-103)

The lights dim and brighten in the foyer to signal that the beginning of the 
performance is imminent.  I put my drink down and begin working my way in 
with the rest of the crowd into the performance arena.  My seat is at 78 
South, 159 East, a bit far south, but well placed in longitude.  As I walk 
into the arena I gasp (as do many others) in spite of having been here 
several times.  

The long sloping inner surface is carpeted with people finding there seats, I 
look straight up (to me) and see the tops of heads of other patrons.  As they 
begin to sit, all facing the center of the sphere, I gaze around at the gold 
leaf cherubim and angels in the architecture.  No expense was spared to make 
us feel as though we were stepping into a more conventional theatre, the 
faces, lighting, only that disconcerting \'ceiling that isn\'t\' to betray the 
illusion, and the steadily rising surface in every direction.  To my left as 
I sit I can see a crystalline chandelier rising from the floor, identical to 
the one opposite, which looks more \'normal\' to me, except for the figures 
walking about its base.

Music from the orchestra changes from the ordered chaos of tuning and warming 
up sounds to the single note by first violin and all others following suit.  
the conductor is applauded as he enters - I can see him clearly, across the 
inside surface, raising his baton.  There\'s not an obstructed seat in the 
house, and there are so many more of them in the same space that a 
conventional theatre would take up.  Its so much nicer actually being able to 
*see* the orchestra.

I look up into the sphere, I could almost see down the throat of the east 
wing were I only further North.  After the long swelling note of the 
overture, a ballerina emerges from the wisps of curtain.  Her bright body 
suit shows the muscular curves of her body.

Drifting outward at a gentle speed she begins her dance.  Pirouetting slowly 
in three dimensions like some feathery terrestrial seed pod, she turns in a 
precise geometric pattern and makes what took years of practice and 
tremendous athletic fitness look easy.  At the other end of the arena her 
hand reaches out for a pivot pole in a seemingly random part of her body\'s 
movement.  She orbits the pole twice before releasing - vectored back the way 
she came at the same pedestrian pace. 

Her partner appears as the music changes, floating out somewhat faster.  They 
meet near the center of the spherical empty space and their hands meet.  Only 
a slight tremble where they hold each other betrays the force involved as 
they rotate around a center of mass between them.  In their rotation he 
passes the energy of his greater velocity to his partner.  They rotate 
once...twice...three times and release at just the right moment, their 
momentum having carried them across the center of the arena, their 
expressions of adoration and sweet movements tell us they are young lovers.  
The heroine flys off in what seems to me to be \'up\'  from their entry 
vectors, landing by collapsing her legs on a transparent platform.  The hero, 
having passed all his energy to her, is motionless in the center.  He gets 
tremendous applause; this precise balance of energy is perhaps the most 
difficult manuver possible.

A third character enters the stage to swelling angry music.  His speed is 
greater still and he and our protagonist do imaginary, abstract battle in the 
center of the arena.  They fly at each other with long, wicked looking 
spears.  After a couple of violent passes the enemy grabs the spear of our 
hero below the spearhead, flinging him forward, directly towards my seat.  
The protagonist hooks his spear on another pivot pole and reverses direction, 
while his enemy lands on another of the few transparent platforms placed 
around the perimeter.  I shake my head at the skill required to aim so 
carefully from 10 meters away, while spinning.

The abstract drama plays itself out.  The crowd applauds, and in the end the 
hero and heroine exit together.  The villan vanquished.

Behind the scenes;

The dancers are very specialized in zero-g-manuvering.  They are not 
particularly talented at zero-g-combat, but then again they can probably hold 
their own pretty well (especially hand-to-hand).  Also, to be a dancer of 
this sort requires great strength, dexterity, and endurance (at least a 10 in 
each, offhand), just as more conventional ballet and other dancers/figure 
skaters/acrobats do.  The arena I chose to use is a sphere about 30 meters 
across.  Careful and expensive gravitic controls allow the gravity to be 
normal (1g) around the perimeter of the spherical chamber and out to just 2.5 
meters from the sphere\'s surface while absent in the center.  This postulates 
a degree of control over gravitics that may make some referees wince (it made 
me wince), but there you have it.  Around the perimeter of the sphere in 
conventional locations (i.e. in the same place in every arena) are four 
transparent round platforms for \'landings\' and \'launchings\', and twelve or 
more \'pivot poles\' which are identical to the type of pole used for the high 
bar or uneven bars in gymnastics (they flex just a bit so they can be used to 
build momentum).

The platforms are at the \'top\' and \'bottom\' and on the \'right\' and \'left\' of 
the sphere.  At the third dimension, \'front\' and \'back\', are the \'wings\' or 
entrances to the stage.  These are kept at zero G along their length 
(conventionally called their \'throat\').  at the bottom of the each wing 
(furthest from the center of the sphere, that is) is a launching platform 
with handholds so that a dancer can place themselves carefully and launch 
into the arena.  The very exit of the wing is often shrouded by wispy 
curtains which are blown outward by mild airflow.

Pivot poles are placed on either side of each platform and at the end of each 
wing.  On occasion, a single long pole is mounted straight through the center 
of the sphere in one dimension.

Dancers conventionally wear tights and simple accessories or props.  Long 
wispy scarves are currently popular, and knife throwing/catching has been 
employed.  Stage sets are almost never employed, although lighting and laser 
or holographic special effects are occasionally used.  More "modern" 
unconventional dances have employed micro thrust systems (mounted on wrist 
and ankle) which allow dancers to change their vector in midflight.  It will 
be interesting to see what new forms these accessories inspire, but the field 
is very traditional and such unconventional techniques are finding it hard to 
break in.

I see the dancing itself as a cross between figure skating (lots of 
cantilevered spins with a partner) acrobatics (tumbling and use of poles and 
bars) and ballet (strong, graceful, precise movements and strict 
conventions).  Usually there is some sort of abstract story line.  Costumes 
are minimalist and abstract.  The focus is on the movements of the 
performers, anything else is just an accessory.

A mishap by a dancer would send them spinning out of control in a nearly 
random direction, out of the zero-g-field and into the seats (rehearsals 
usually have a net rigged to protect the dancers from injury).  Another 
possibility is being thrown by your partner in just the wrong way, twisting 
your back.  Historically, many injuries among dancers have occurred, ending 
careers and lives.

Remember that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.  
There are many possible actions; friction with the bars or a platform or 
other dancers, grasping and rotation with another dancer, throwing things, 
catching things, collisions, all of which would tend to alter a dancer\'s 
vector or velocity or both.  The hardest thing to judge is changes by the 
dancer alone.  Can a talented dancer manipulate their center of mass around 
enough to change their vector?  No, but they can do an awful lot up to that 
point.  Just keep in mind that once a mass has a given velocity that both 
must be conserved until acted on by an outside force.

In the adventure I am currently running, a major ballet company was 
infiltrated by an assassin.  This person threw a dagger during the 
performance as part of the plot of the dance.  A carefully calculated 
\'mistake\' sent the knife flying past the other dancer and into the stands in 
order to murder one of the non-player characters.  Because a PC had taken the 
place of the intended victim the knife missed the PC\'s heart by about an inch 
(the PC was much shorter than the intended victim).

Hope this was useful.

I find personal accusations like "sophomoric" or the various anti-
Traveller motives attributed to GDW staff short-sighted, intolerant,
and generally uncalled-for.  And I doubt I am alone.

You are, of course, welcome to disagree about the content or style of

be quite so obstreperous about it!

each mainworld in the spinward marches (yow wow!)
according to trade classification.

On Tuesday, I used my automated planet generator
to lift out its statistics, and arrived at similar
numbers.  Thus it shows most likely that the
Spinward Marches were mostly developed using Marc\'s
own system.  No suprise there.  The big surprise
is that, for trade classification purposes, there
are only around 70 planet types.

Here are sample runs, with a running count, trade
classification, number of occurrances, and percentage
of the whole.  Note that the output is not cross-
indexed or anything fancy like that; it\'s just by
ascii alphabetical order, using the classifications
as a string.

Planet count=36:
There are 16 planet types.

There are around 500 planets in the Spinward Marches,
and the pattern is pretty much the same as those
shown above.

Yeah, but the original alien modules were weak when compared to the
ones that were done by DGP as well.  I found them to be sparse in all
respects.  Compare the two Aslan or Vargr modules.

Yes, it was recycled TNS material, but it was there.  For the first
time, they compiled all the necessary information and made it
available.  Before you\'d have to start fishing for back issues, and
that would definitely get expensive.

A lot of rehashed material, a lot of new material as well.  You can\'t
forego presenting previously published information.  The problem is
that many new players don\'t have access to the old stuff.  Hell, I\'ve
been playing Traveller for 9 years now (so yes, I am a youngin) and I
still don\'t own a copy of Secrets of the Ancients or many of the
Double Adventures.  Maybe the Star Wars RGP was on to something when
it decided to also republish out-of-print material updated for their
2ed.

But you know what, RSB is hands down one of the best supplements ever
made.  It contains it all.  If anything that was in it was left out,
we would have been disappointed or felt cheated.  As far as the page
count goes, do you really think Nilsen had anything to do with that,
or do you think that it may have been his boss who was trying to keep
his company from going under?

Let him write.  I don\'t think the problem is when he write, I think
it\'s when one person has to write practically everything.  I think the
diversified approach is the best (so it\'s a good thing to see IG going
that way).  Hell, I figure that Nilsen probably would be the person to
do their New Era mileau when it comes out (oops, am I sounding too
positive there?).

No.  I think that RSB was an attempt to fit a watermelon into a 
banana peel.  Clearly, the teeny weeny font size was an effort to 
cram a lot of material onto as few a number of pages as possible.  
Not really anyone\'s fault, other than GDW being in a crunch 
financially...

OK, I concede, RSB did give a good amount of info for the buck...

You might be on to something here.  Most of the earlier works were a 
collaborative effort.  Let\'s face it, TNE was pretty much Nilsen\'s 
baby.  I still think that too much of Dave, and too little of the 
game showed in some of the writing though.

That isn\'t what they CALL it: they call it Traveller; anything else is too

differentiate it). When we need to distinguish between the editions, I think
most everyone has been on track already:

CT: Classic Traveller
MT: MegaTraveller
TNE: New Era
T4: New Traveller

We already know what is meant by the abbreviations and they say what they
mean.

Now don\'t get me wrong, MMT has a nice ring to it to my ear, but I think T4
is more appropriate.

Annic Nova was written as an exploration adventure inspired entirely by the
drawing of the Annic Nova. At first, I wasn\'t sure which side was "up." As an
early adventure, I was feeling my way around on what to write and what to
include. Included in the descriptions and texts were various clues to

IMHO This was one of the best parts of that adventure.  The ship was so old 
or from so far away that there was no way to figure out just who built it or 
where it came from.

It\'s a bit like Stonehenge, or Easter Island (only high tech).  A mystery to 
be pondered, not solved.

This is the way I like published adventures to be.  I don\'t want an 
absolute paucity of information, but if I\'m given a lot of possibilities 
to pursue with my players, it makes it more fun for my whole group.  I 
don\'t like the scripted style that many published adventure scenarios 
take, wherein the GM is given a linear or near-linear path to lead his 
players down.  Allowing the referee and the players to determine together 
who is was that owned the Annic Nova actually ended up providing 
additional adventuring material for future sessions!

Does anyone else prefer published adventures that are filled with 
"hooks?" (That is, containing lots of alternate paths to pursue, with enough 
background detail given that the referee can allow his players to follow 
whatever path they choose.)

Given my players, that\'s the only way I can play adventures. My players
seem to find their own hooks whether I\'m ready or not.

TOY stores had RPGs?  Wow, I\'ve never seen that.  THe only places around me
that carry RPGs are ONE gaming store, and a comic stores carrys AD&D, and
ONE book store carrys about three AD&D products.

That would be difficult.  I mean, does anyone know a gamer out there who ahs
never tried his\\her hand at AD&D?  I don\'t.  It was the first game I played,
and, even though I don\'t play it as much now, it is still kind of enjoyable.
It allows me to look back on what I used to play.

This would probably depend on Traveller\'s sales, if I\'m correct.  I know
spots on any Star Trek series cost a helluva lot, and most small (no offense
IG!) can\'t afford them.

However, space in Asimov\'s probably doesn\'t cost half as much, and there\'s
probably a lot of players, and potential players who read it.  Also, they\'d
probably think that if a game can be in Asimov\'s, then it must be quite good.

Definitely, it\'d be great if when I asked for Traveller in my local game
store they didn\'t say "Trav-a-what?" and then say "Check the back corner..."

The second one isn\'t that bad, he is a 35 year-old scout.  However, my

Yup! I had the K\'kree, unknowingly controlled by a disguised bonkers Ancient

capture Strephon. Guess who had to sneak into captured territory disguised as
Sworn, and spring the Emperor, and scout for the first strike back from deneb

It\'s the end of the campaign, which has been active in various forms for 12
years - certainly the primary character has- , so I feel able to make it almost
ludicrously high-powered. I\'ve made it clear I may rewind history afterwards and
return to a more conventional timeline. Hey, we\'re enjoying ourselves!

After this I plan to move forwards c.100 years and pick up Ace\'s descendants (ie
fresh player characters).

[BTW: I just plunked down my 35Cr for the new Traveller Hard Bound.  Kinda
feels good.... :-) (and the Mrs. didn\'t even complain)]

I remember the first time I went through Annic Nova.  It was so alien.  We all
know the Vargr, and Zhodani, but here was this complete unknown.  It was spooky
in a way.  I think thats why I like that adventure.  I am always expecting 
some acid dripping alien to step around a corner and ruin my vacc-suit.

The other adventure that I really liked, though I never got to play it was
Leviathan.  There was some mystic to that large trader travelling though
the wilds in the Spinward Fringe.  It was cool to go to worlds that had not
been spyed on, I mean surveyed by the IISS.  You didn\'t know what or who was
there.  

(so I can get the most out of these postings . . .)
On some list adminstravia:

Digests should be ok on the FTP site now (Yea Team!)

Bounces:  I have written the postmaster at the site that is bouncing asking

figure majordomo out, I will try to block things like that (what I tried
yesterday didn\'t work).

Yea, Toys \'r\' Us has typically carried AD&D for several years, though that has waned of late.  Our Walden\'s has a good selection of AD&D and some other odd stuff.  One of the Managers is a gamer, so they get stuff that he is currently into but can\'t go much past the corporate line of carrying AD&D stuff.

I think thats what IG wants us to do.  When we visit a store, try to talk to the Buyer and let them know there will be new products for this way cool RPG called
"Marc Miller\'s Traveller" comming out soon.

TV spots may be a bit much right now, even TSR doesn\'t advertise AD&D on a 
national broadcast media that I am aware of.  However, one place to think about
advertising would be (drum roll please) The Sci-Fi Channel.  Actually, if IG could arrange it as feature article on some of the "news" oriented programs like Sci-Fi Buzz or FTL Newsfeed.  Also, IG should look at some of the Sci-Fi web sites like "Sci-Fi Weekly".  If they do articles, then that can go a long
way to market the game for free.

That has been my experience, too.  Fortunately, I\'ve never had sheep-like 
players willing to follow the obvious path. :)  They keep me on my toes . 
. . 

The way the CT Adventures were written (those by GDW, FASA, and 
Gamelords, at least) gave the referee plenty of background information, 
which helps a lot.  I wonder whether the new Traveller game\'s published 
adventures will follow the old formula?

I am creating the first of the expansions for the new Marc Miller\'s
Traveller series, appropriately named Starships. I am interested in any aid
that you can give me. I am using the starship building rules from the
original Classic Traveller book for small ships, and the High Guard system
for larger ships. There have been some minor modifications, but the only
one that will affect how things are done is that Jump drives are restricted
to tech levels A and above

If you have any glaring holes in the building systems, or any comments on
how to easily update it where you think it needs it, please feel free to
email me. I may not take every suggestion, but I will consider all
suggestions.

Also, what I would like is your fabulous design and research abilities. I\'d
like a set of statistics, a 100 to 250 word description of the ship, the
name of the first known example of the ship, and the USPs of the following
ships:

Escape Pod
Express Boat
Launch
Ship\'s Boat
Slow Boat
Pinnace
Slow Pinnace
Modular Cutter
Shuttle
Scout
Courier
Seeker
Free Trader
Subsidized Merchant
Subsidized Liner
Yacht
Military / Government Patrol Cruiser
Mercenary Cruiser
Laboratory Ship
Safari Ship
Close Escort
Gig
System Defense Boat
Corsair
Military Destroyer
Light Fighter
Medium Fighter
Heavy Fighter
Missile Fighter
Military Carrier

Please use as much of what\'s already out there in your designs. I will
credit you in the work as the "Chief Naval Architect" in the book. Please
email me if you\'re interested, and what ship(s) you\'re interested in doing.
Remember that we\'re doing this in the Year 0 of the Imperium (or within 20
years). If I like your design, I will use it. If you have access to a
program that will produce Illustrator style .eps files, and you want to do
deck layouts, we\'d love to see those, too.

Let me see what you can do!

Thanks for your interest and help!

Many of my old issues of Analog magazine have ads from GDW for Traveller.
I suspect their rates (and Asimov\'s) would be quite reasonable, and might
even bring new players into the hobby (much as CT did originally!). 

The Sci-Fi channel is a great idea: surely there are enough Traveller fans
with ray-tracing software to make some cool animations for a short ad....

My problem is that swords in space are just *too* silly.  I\'m reminded 
far too much of the overblown space operas of the 30s and 40s.  There are 
other, more interesting (to me) answers.  Snub pistols were mentioned as 
being designed for this purpose.  Their recoil is low and the 
penetration for all shell types except HEAP is 1.  They basically can\'t 
accidentally harm anything in the ship.  In addition, sonic stunners (if 
used), gas rounds, and for the very high tech, neural weapons all all 
good choices for non-military shipboard combat.  

For military battles things become a bit different:

Laser pistols (TL: 9) and Gauss pistols both only have penetrations of 4. 
This is enough to penetrate all standard vacc suits, but if every major
piece of equipment on a military starship had armor of at least 8 they
would be useful weapons.  However, if the military is fighting other
military it is likely that everyone is wearing at least Combat Armor TL-12
(armor value 10).  No hand weapons except Axes and Harlberds (not very
convenient to wield in a starship corridor) can do anything against this
type of armor.  In addition, most slug throwers and lasers have trouble
handling this type of armor. 

The weapons that can penetrate such armor and do significant damage are 
also a danger to the starship.  The problem is much worse when dealing 
with TL 14 armor (AV: 18).  To achieve a high penetration shot on that 
kind of armor you risk using a weapon that can shoot through the hull, 
and destroying the ship they are trying to capture.

I\'m not sure of how to get around this problem, other than to say that
mostly military forces just blow up starships at a distance rather than 
attempting to board.

Well Sorry to inform you but marines do not provide security on US

Which I must admit suprised me.  I don\'t know if the other
alien modules would show similar results (i.e. somewhere in
the 20s) but it would appear that you were getting nearly 5
blank pages in the last Alien Module.

I appreciate that this may bear no correlation to the quality
of the content but it does suggest that ideas/time/money or
something was getting a bit short.

My impression from your post is that we can use either classic or High Guard
rules, and that the only change we have to worry about are the new computer
tables you posted.  Am I approximately correct?

For a few grand a week, you could also get some tremoundous coverage in
well-established magazines that hits markets outside the 50% of households

    'body' => 'Mr. Perrin:

I have been a fan of Traveller since my sophomore year in high school
(79-80).  I have a copy of *every* Traveller product published by GDW,
with the exception of the very earliest issues of JTAS.  

I *never* liked the construction rules in CT Book2; I always used Book5
(HG) for starship construction (until Brilliant Lances & FFS came along,
that is, whereupon I dropped Book5 like a hot potato).  

Some of my complaints about Book2 (and Book5, to a lesser extent, where
applicable) are as follows: 

	1) The capacity of computers compared to the requirements of
programs is ridiculously inadequate for a industrial technological society
that is *several* *thousand* years old.  (I am a computer professional who
has studied the trends of increasing capacity vs. increasing needs, with
avid interest, for many years.) 

	2) The vector-based movement system of Book2 was too
space-consuming at the scale used (one inch representing one thousand
miles).  In Book5, however, the resolution of combat/movement was *completely*
intangible (which is intolerable to an anal-retentive detail-freak like me
:-).  

	3) The design systems made *no* allowance for sensor and/or commo 
systems (range; detection/counter-detection; detail of resolution; etc.).  

	4) Book2 produced starship design that were space-inefficient when 
compared to Book5 (*my* Bk5 X-Boats had J5 *and* M1; under FFS, they had
J4, M1, *and* 1,000 flight computers [simulating the mythical "extensive
arrays of databanks" always mentioned but never seen]).  
	(BTW: Can you *really* envision the Vilani using an as inefficient
a means of designing merchant ships as this? :-) 

In short, now that I\'ve been spoiled with FFS, anything less is
insufficient.  I would suggest that you design a modular system in the
same *style* as Book2, but build the various modules/components using your
/ IG\'s version of FFS.  (Then you can "publish" your version of FFS on your
web page for the gearheads amongst us who want it.)  

You and Marc and Ken have said that you\'re revising the CT rules "in light
of 20+ years of experience."  As *several* members of this list (i.e.,
"potential customers") have stated, once you have a light-detail framework
in place, it will be difficult to design a more detailed framework *that*
*fits*; if you *start* with a more-detailed framework (even if you never
publish it), you can "dumb-down" the level of detail very easily.  

OTOH, you asked us to tell you if we saw any "glaring holes."  Your chart
of "Size (in displacement tons) of Computers by Tech Level" forgot that
*spaceships* (not starships) can be built at TL-7, 8, and 9.  You need
entries for these TL\'s on your chart.  

I\'d be interested in hearing your refutation/rebuttal.  Thank you.

is made that more customers will be lost than gained by keeping things 
simple.  At first, I kept quiet about this, but now I think it\'s time to 
say something on behalf of those who don\'t require extreme complexity.

As noted earlier, Traveller (esp. CT) has always been a moduler system.  
If you didn\'t like Book 2\'s way of doing things, you could always pick up 
High Guard.  Similarly, you could choose from the basic ship combat 
model, Mayday, Azhanti High Lightning, and/or Snapshot.  Mix and match, 
use whatever appeals to you.

I want to reiterate my support of this approach.  I want Traveller to 
succeed, and I feel strongly that offering a less-complex approach as the 
standard system will bring more players than it will drive away.  If this 
is followed up with a more complex (yet optional) system, the totality of 
the audience will receive something they like.  This approach should 
alienate no one, whereas offering a complex version first then a simpler 
version as a supplement could very well lose customers.  

The moduler system, with simple core rules and complex supplemental 
rules, is the way to go.  This is what IG and MM have said they would do, 
and I sincerely hope they do not allow the advocates of complexity above 
all else sway them.

I totally agree with you; however, it might be a good idea to do a complete
rewrite of the original, "simpler" rules. It was very hard to visualize. My
group eventually turned to other rules (we wound up using Task Force
Games\' *Starfire* rules for ship-to-ship combat). It\'s much easier to deal
with ship-to-ship combat using a mapsheet and counters than it is any
other way. And the Starfire rules can be REALLY simple: the current
version has a four (4!) page "starter" set of rules, with a 96 page book of
"advanced" rules, that take into account everything from fighters to
mines. I\'d love IG to design something like that.

I agree with you, but I\'d like to see a counter-based system in its place.

Analog has a higher circulation, the rates are the same, and it draws more of
a \'hard-science\' readership.  But I like the idea, assuming that the ad
budget can afford it.

I wouldn\'t object to a counter- or miniatures-based system.  I think it 
is a good way to play anything but the most basic (ie, one-on-one) 
battle.  I\'d buy such a system.

But, again, I think that is something that would best be handled outside 
of the basic game (ie, in a "Snapshot" or "Mayday" type supplement) if 
it involves, as you say, a "complete rewrite" of the original rules.  
Also, I can remember being daunted by counters when I was a fledgling 
gamer.  They made it seem much more complex than it was.  "I\'ve gotta 
remember what all these counters are, and what their individual abilities 
are??  Aaiigghh!" :)  But, maybe I\'m the only one that thinks that way.

I support IG\'s stated goal of a basic system that is not complex, but 
which is supplemented by increasingly complex material in the form of 
additional books.  We old-timer Traveller players can use our current 
complex systems as add-ons until IG produces the T4 equivalent.  In the 
mean-time, the simplicity (dare I say...elegance?) of the core rules will 
(hopefully) bring in new gamers by the droves. :)

FASA published a supplement for CT which had prices for a wide variety of 
common items. I can\'t recall the name of it at the moment.

The Gurkhas are still issued Kukris as part of their official equipment,

Hello Don,  
 
I\'d love to help out with ship design. I\'ve already got

I\'m partial to the Scout, Lab Ship, or one of the large, 
High Guard-rule ships, but I\'ll take any. 
 
Also, let me suggest another one that I had in mind 
for a campaign focus -- an old Sylean Federation 
Battle Rider Tender, converted for use by the Scout 
service for long-range exploring and diplomacy. 
Instead of an Enterprise-style exploration ship, 
it acts as a mothership for a variety of smaller 
vessels. 
 
 
In any event, two things Designers need to know: 
 
1) Tech level: what\'s the maximum, and how common is that 
maximum (i.e., if max TL is 11, would a typical scout 
ship be at TL-11, or would a more common example be TL-10)? 
 
2) In a few cases that you listed, a suggested tonnage 
would be helpful.

I guess I fall somewhere in the middle on this one.  

I don\'t want to go back to something as simple as Book 2.  As soon 
as I bought Book 5 High Guard, I basically all but forgot about the 
book 2 design rules (and that was 15 years ago).  I thought the 
results were too abstract, and I liked the combat system less than 
the designs.
I really didn\'t find High Guard to be all that cumbersome a design process.  
They were still relatively easy to design, and the combat system was much 
improved, although it is now dated.  I would suggest that a High Guard system 
(revamped) should be a bare minimum for simplistic design rules.

I don\'t like FF&S.  I thought the organization of the book made it 
difficult to read, and I really didn\'t see the point in devoting a 
lot of space to "alternate" technologies that weren\'t ever going to 
be supported by any other book in the system.  I guess the 
overwhelming complexity cut into my limited time too much to think 
about using it.

I liked MT, at least after taking advantage of the errata.  It was 
complex enough to really make ship design interesting, yet it still 
takes me just a little while to design a vehicle or ship.  I thought 
the complexity was just about my speed.  Frankly, If the new design 
rules don\'t grab me, I\'ll probably continue to use MT rules.

I would make the following suggestions at a minimum for whatever 
design rules are used, and whatever form Starships take.

1.  Proofread.  Both FF&S and MT suffered grievously (especially MT) 
from very poorly edited design rules.  I would rather see well 
written and edited design rules that I\'m not real crazy about than 
have to white out several pages and insert new tables...

2.  Design lots of ships.  Some of us who run campaigns are pressed for time.  
Although I enjoy designing ships, there are lots of times where it just isn\'t 
possible.  It\'d be nice to have a couple hundred ship designs to pick 
and choose from to incorporate games.  

3.  It sounds like you actually figured this one out, but don\'t make 
a system as complex as FF&S as your ONLY design system.  While I see 
no problem with designing an FF&S style supplement for the gearheads, 
I sure wouldn\'t want to be FORCED to design a ship with one.

I\'ve subscribed to Analog for close to 30 years now.  You\'re right

Great! a Grand Admiral and a Scout (both of whom know nothing about the rich
history of the Imperium) and are just starting out. Maybe they have amnesia?
Or just stepped out of cold sleep after 900 years? Or aren\'t Imperials at
all: they are from some dinky empire far far away. Seems to me you have great
potential for adventure here.

Merely telling my local game store about the game will cause him to
carry it. My group is kind of responsible for his success in non-D&D
gaming. I would place ads in Game Supporting (read RPG) magazines.
There\'s a bunch of them, pick the format that appeals to you. Believe
it or not you probably have the same tastes as potential T4 players.

Like many others, I think TV ad prices are probably excessive (the Sci-Fi 
channel possibly excepted). Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact, again, 
would seem the best-targeted fiction magazine for Traveller\'s potential 
audience.  The usual raft of gaming-mag ads (Dragon, Pyramid, maybe some 
of the smaller fry like Shadis and d8) are an obvious route.

Don\'t underestimate the value of a good poster.  I know my local game 
dealer (Nan\'s Games & Comics Too, here in Houston) always likes good-
looking game posters to hang up in the window.  (Keeps the interior
wholly artifically lighted, to avoid scaring much of the clientele....
:-)  They stay there for months, providing valuable advertising.
The sort of art IG is already featuring on the Web page might be quite
successful, combined with some good ad copy in an exciting typeface.

TSR has huge budgets and production values, but they seem quite 
successful with multi-page pull-out centerfold ads in gaming magazines 
(viz. their recent AD&D history trivia quiz or whatever it is).  I
don\'t know how monetarily prohibitive such a "souvenir piece" might
be -- say, a four-page insert on "high-tech" glossy paper, with the
front page taken by poster-style art, the second by the story of the
Traveller universe (Ziru Sirkaa to Long Night), the third by the call
of the resurgent Sylean Federation for new explorers and merchants 
(perhaps penned by noted industrialist Cleon Zhunastu himself?), and
the back page by the story of the game system itself (when DID Traveller 
start?  Can you pull a 1976 vs. 1996 schtick?), its own parallel 
resurgence, and the list of upcoming support and supplements (including, 
of course, a plug for the ever-growing Web page to show you\'re high-
tech in actuality as well as in fiction).

If IG made available a well-written, nicely-laid-out game ad/prospectus 
on the Web page in, say, Adobe Acrobat format, intended for distribution
to game retailers, I\'d happily download it, run down to Kinko\'s, print one 
out on their spiffy machines, and hand-carry it to my retailer.  I already
provide him with the occasional Internet tidbit, and I think he\'d get a 
charge out of such a distribution method.  You might be able to cover 
several major cities without paying postage.  :-)

You are essentially correct. I am looking at including a sensor set of

A brief update on the Traveller Sale & Auction I\'m running...

For the first two weeks of this run, I\'m taking bids. If you bid for an item
and nobody else bids on that item, then it will be a straight sale to you at
the end of the two weeks.

If there are multiple bids on an item, then we will go into auction mode for
the next two weeks.

If there is anything unsold after these first four weeks, then I\'ll probably
have a "fire sale" with gut-wrenching low prices. Gut-wrenching, that is, for
you--if you want something real bad, but think I\'m asking too much, your gut
will be wrenching while you wait four weeks (snicker).

I\'m not trying to make a profit here--merely trying to sell off duplicates
and get them into the hands of folks who can use them.

I currently have a number of individual bids on items, plus a block bid of
$300 cash or $400 in trade for the whole thing.

I received one piece of mail that (I hope jokingly) called me a racist for
disallowing non-US/Canadian customers from participating. Obviously this
person does not know me personally, as they would find that I am one of the
more mild and inoffensive persons around. So, as I said, I hope this was a
joke. Certainly, though, the accusation make my blood boil.

The reason for the exclusion on non-US/Canadian customes is simple: Several
years ago I sold off a number of items from my collection (mostly duplicates)
as I pared back. The ratio of money recieved to pain received was not good. I
had problems with shipping stuff overseas. I had problems with foreign
exchange rates. I had problems with people sending me checks with foreign
funds. I had problems with customs. I had problems with the Post Office (and
with foreign post offices). I had irate letters from people who could not
understand why their first class/airmail letter reached me faster than the
package I sent them--when they had paid for "ground" postage. Do you know
what "ground" postage to Europe gets you? A berth on the bananna boat, and
that ain\'t a fast way of travelling.

So excuse me if I exclude non-US/Canadian customers. I\'m trying to get this
stuff out with a minimum of hassle. I\'m not trying to hassle or exclude
folks--just trying to help you out and spread the wealth of information that
is currently locked in my basement.

Okay, time for the arts student to speak up (life\'s like a box of
chocolates...:-)!  I don\'t know where the rest of you get the time to spend
4 hours designing a starship for an RPG, but I have a life to worry about. 
FF&S is completely impractical for me and (I suspect) the vast majority of
the population out there.  I really like the HG design system, I can get
a ship up and running in 15 minutes.  That leaves me 3.75 hours to
actually RPG (or maybe like, y\'know, work or socialize or something!). If 
I need a ship in the middle of a session, I can send the players on a 
munchie run and by the time they get back, it\'s ready.

Sorry, this is sounding a little beligerent.  Too much caffeine I guess.  
But my point is that for me personally a return to HG is wonderful.  I 
could stand a _little_ more detail, but nothing like FF&S.  Detail (IMHO) is
pointless for role-playing purposes.  If what you get off on is designing
stuff, then do that, but I don\'t think it is integral to most people\'s 
concepts of roleplaying.  Certainly not the hordes of gamers who buy (and 
actually play!) such games as GURPS and the Storyteller series.

Having said that, I could live with an FF&S light product, but I think 
I\'m talking "fat-free" where others are thinking "calorie reduced".

    'body' => 'Okay, while we\'re taking a new look (or an old look made new, or whatever)
at Traveller starship construction, I\'ll draw some fire by talking about
the perennial problem of crew sizes.  Some heretical changes in Traveller
"canon" are going to come out of this, but I think the discussion might
prove interesting.

I\'d like to advocate the larger model of crew sizes used by TNE rather 
than the smaller model pursued first by CT and then by MT, but perhaps
with a stronger variation as tech level increases.  I\'ll support my 
position with some math below: for now let me address the role-playing
possibilities.

David Nilsen (whom I do _not_ regard as Truth Incarnate, but who strikes 
me as a smart, thoughtful fellow with some good ideas) defended the
larger crew sizes at one or another Origins talk by describing the
potential for NPC\'s (whether as social acquaintances, redshirts for
the bloody-minded beasties, etc.), technical difficulties to be solved 
by skill rolls and exciting role-play when the vessel\'s crew size
drops significantly (due to, say, starship combat, which also paid more
attention (laudably) to the individual in TNE), and a sense of greater
"realism".  One of the things that always disappointed me about TNE/FF&S
was the assumption that crew sizes had always been thus, even in the 
pre-Virus, heavily-computerized Third Imperium.  I wanted to hear about
cargo bays aboard relic starships partly transformed into extra state-
rooms to allow the RC\'s (or Free Traders\') TL12 human-controlled systems
to handle starships designed for the TL15 Imperials.  But somehow that
bit of chrome didn\'t make it in, except in a few GDW-beta discussions
on the topic.

More widely-varying crew sizes would also exacerbate TL differences
during interstellar wars, which would help explain Vargr futility in
attacking all but weakly-defended systems during the Frontier Wars,
the rapid Terran victory in the original Interstellar Wars after
leap-frogging the Vilani, and so on.

I\'ll take a fairly hard-line approach below, and my assumptions are of 
course open to argument.  For the sake of simplicity, I\'m going to assume
fairly steady rates of variation in the "assist" provided to crew by command-
and-control systems.  Linear rather than geometric progressions would change
the results a lot.

Now for some math:  I\'m using the "All Hands: Magazine of the U.S. Navy"
"Owner\'s and Operator\'s Manual" from January 1996.  A Los Angeles class
attack submarine (probably our closest analogy to a Traveller starship),
has a displacement (submerged) of 6,927 tons and a crew complement of
145 (p. 39).  Now, those are tons of water.  I figure an English ton is
around 908kg (though I\'m figuring this in spare time at work and might be 
off a smidgen here or there: I\'m sure someone will correct me if I\'m wrong!
:-).  So a displacement ton is around .9 m^3 (1 m^3 of water weiging 
1000kg).  So a displacement ton is around .9/14 or .0643 Traveller
tons (14 m^3 of LHyd weighing 1000kg).  And the Los Angeles submarine is
thus about 6,927 x 0.0643 = 445 tons, which seems about right.  (It\'s
a system defense boat!)

Now, with 145 crew for 445 tons, that\'s about 0.326 crew per ton.  CT\'s 
TL12 400-ton SDB, from CT Supplement 7 "Traders and Gunboats", has a crew 
of 10.  That\'s 0.025 per ton.  So the TL12 SDB requires 7.7% as much crew 
as the TL7 sub, on a ton-for-ton basis.  That\'s like achieving a 30% 
reduction in crew size at each tech level (12-7 = 5, (.077)^.2 = .60),
which I find only barely on the verge of believable.  At that rate, a
TL15 SDB would require only 1.7% as much crew as the sub (.60^8 = 0.05),
or about 0.006 crew per ton (that\'s two people for the entire SDB).

MT kept the crew size for the SDB about the same, at 12 (p. 85 Imperial
Encyclopedia, though I don\'t have the errata handy with me, alas).  TNE
yanked the crew requirement for the SDB to 24 (p. 373 main rule book),
which, at a ratio of 0.06 (18% the sub), gives a decline rate of about 
29%.  Hmmm.

Let\'s assume that a true "singleship" (e.g. an IISS Scout/Courier, which 
we\'re told can be run by one person in a pinch (which would be 0.1 persons
per ton)) only becomes possible at TL15.  This yields a decline rate of
24%, which somehow I feel happier about.  The SDB, at TL12, would thus
have a crew size (roughly) of [(.86)^5]*.326*400 = 61.

Now hold on there with the tar and feathers!  I don\'t have any problem 
with that crew size for a vessel that\'s got to be able to maintain itself 
while hiding out in gas giants while armed with heavy ordnance (nuclear
missiles, sensitive lasers, or what-have-you).  And that\'s still less 
than a third of what a modern nuclear submarine has to work with, under
much less challenging conditions.  The higher crew size, in fact,
INCREASES my sense of wonder rather than lessening it, thinking about
all those guys scrambling around the ship while prowling on patrol.

A non-military vessel like, say, the standard far trader (200 tons), 
might be able to get away with, say, a third of the ratio of a military
ship (fewer complex and highly-ruggedized systems, no necessity for 
redundancy in case of casualties, etc.).  So our Empress Marava, at 
TL12, might need only [(.86)^5]*.109*200 = 10 crew.  And by TL 15, in 
the height of the Third Imperium, far traders would be down to 
[(.86^8)]*.109*200 = 6 or 7 crew, around the size of the stereotypical
gaming group.

Traveller\'s huge capital starships would now become truly impressive war 
machines on the _human_ scale as well as the purely physical one.  We\'d
have a good explanation for the failure of many TL9 or TL10 cultures,
during the Long Night, say, to form self-sufficient interstellar trading
communities (a crew of (.86^3)*.109*200 = 14 on a far trader crimps
the economics a bit more, except, perhaps, to visionaries like Cleon
Zhunastu, who see what wider trade and technical dissemination will do
for his people).

Comments?  Suggestions?  I think I\'ve managed to keep things _reasonably_
close to the CT scale, except for military vessels (which I always found
too small) and low-tech ships (which adds to the allure of "trading up"
to higher-tech equipment).  Heck, I might throw these into a home-grown
campaign even if IG doesn\'t in the formal rules-set.  And I don\'t even
belong to GDW-beta... maybe I should join all the other heretics over
there....  :-)

Both would probably motivate me.  Getting TV ads during popular SF shows, or
on the SF Channel (which I can\'t get :(  would be good, as would print ads
in popular SF magazines.  However, just make sure the ads are well done, and
show what the game will be like.

I like this idea.  It sounds pretty good.  I know that with my local gaming
store, they\'ll pretty much order in ANYTHING.  However, the trick is in
getting them to stock the item regularly.  If you made up something like an
information sheet that we could download and take in that\'d be good.  Only
problem is that colour graphics would be lost on me as my printer only does B&W.

If Imperial Games feels they need two systems (one in the main rules, one

simple system and the MT rules as the complex one. 

I also like the way the MT rules are the same for vehicles, small craft,
and starships, and recommend that this unity be kept.

  US Subs are actually not as automated as they could be. The newest
Swedish sub (Gotland, around 1500 tons submerged) has a wartime crew of 
around 17. For example there is only one man at the helm, not four+one
officer to oversee them.

The other night, on X-boat, tc@library.solent.ac.uk asked if anyone 
was going to publish the rumored \'unfinished DGP Aliens Modules.  
That tickled my memory; back when GDW was going down and no one here 
knew what was going on, I\'d thought that Rger Sanger had mentioned 
something about the rights to DGP stuff.  I wrote him, and he\'s given 
me permission to quote his reply:

- ---- Forwarded Message Follows ---- 
Dear Bruce,
 
Thankyou for your interest in DGP\'s operations. DGP is working
diligently on its very own game system. We\'re working on a set of
core rules, and 3 distinct campaign settings. We have no idea
when these will be ready for publication.
 
We are also looking forward to rereleasing DGP\'s Traveller
archives in various forms, and we are interested in publishing
new works for the Traveller game system. WE ARE CURRENTLY IN
NEGOTIATIONS WITH IMPERIUM GAMES & MARC MILLER. We\'re in
agreement on the general terms of the licensing contract, but
these things take time, and there are still details to be worked
out. Just as soon as the contract is signed, we will get back to
work on Traveller. We won\'t even wait for the ink to dry!
 
And yes, there are unfinished Traveller projects in DGP\'s
archives in various stages of completion.
 
I hope I\'ve answered your questions satisfactorily.
 
Sincereley,

In here you\'re preaching to the choir!  I think we\'re all motivated to
seek out a copy of T4 and look it over.  <g> The general gaming public
is much less aware of Traveller.

Two quick stories:

    The other day I was in one of local game/comic stores that carries
a good selection of used games (looking for a copy of World Builders
Handbook which they didn\'t have ;<), and struck up a short
conversation with a teen.

He said, "Do you play?"

"Yes, mainly Traveller.", I replied waving at the display of
CT/MT/TNE/TW2K/2300 books.

"Traveller?  Is that like Magic?"

"No, it\'s role playing, science fiction.  A new version is coming out
in August."

"Oh.", he looks blank for a second, "It\'s like DnD, huh?"

IG has it\'s work cut out!  This kid was an avid card gamer, in a game
store, standing in front of a shelf with >50 CT/MT/TNE titles, and
didn\'t have the slightest idea what Traveller was.

  The next day I dropped in at a card shop to pick up a birthday card. 
This shop is where I bought MT when it came out, 2300, 1889, TW2K,
TNE, and where I always bought JTAS and Challenge Mag. After picking
out the card, I browsed through their game section, and found a few
lonely MT, 2300, TW2K and TNE suppliments scattered among the
Gurps/AD&D/WW stuff.  One of the shopkeepers came back, saw what I was
looking at and told me...

"Oh, that\'s dead.  The company went out of business."

"GDW? Yes, I know."

"All that stuff is 50% off we\'re closing it out."

"Did you know a new version of Traveller is coming out in August?", I
ask.

"No...I thought they were out of business?"

"Oh, it\'s a new company, Imperium Games.  They\'re going back to the
feel of the first version.  The buzz is that this new one is going to
be really good."

"I\'ll have to ask our distributer about it.", she says but she doesn\'t
sound enthusastic.
  
Now, here\'s a shop that\'s stocked everything Traveller since the CT
days, and they don\'t know anything about it today other than..."it\'s
dead, and the company is out of business."
  
Is this depressing?

Shouldn\'t be!  Look on it as an opportunity.  Traveller is going to
have to be marketed to the public, many distributers and most shops as
if it were a brand *new* game.  IG is going to have to ignite a fire. 
They need to be contacting distributers
bombarding them with marketing materials and samples NOW!  They must
get marketing materials into the hands of shop owners NOW! They\'ve got
to raise the gaming public\'s awareness of Traveller.
  
>One thought I had was a specific piece each of you should

Couldn\'t hurt!

There are 2 or 3 stores in my town that will probably carry T4, if
they can get it from a distributer, if folks ask for it, and if
there\'s some kind of buzz generated around it\'s release. 


BTW, in the past I\'ve talked with the owners of 2 of the stores and
both of them have bad things to say about trying to move MT. They were
leary about stocking TNE stuff, but they continued to stock TW2K books
all along.  I had to special order most of what I got from them after
TNE came out.

Steve\'s Expanded USP
XX-000000AB0-000000C-00000-0

1.  Sensors (and Detection Rules)
I have always used two additional values in the UPP to describe the Active and 
Passive Sensors on the ship (noted by A and B in the sample USP above).  The 
Passive Sensors were available in a number of different sizes/powers, 
restricted by the size of the ship and its tech level (as well as the bank 
account of the ship builder).  The Active Sensors were also available in a 
number of different sizes/powers, restricted by the ship\'s Computer and Tech 
Level.  Different sensor packages had different ranges, and in some cases had 
better performance in special circumstances (detecting things in an atmosphere, 
or high-radiation area etc).  The passive sensors were all basically the same, 
differentiated mainly by detection range.

But of course Sensors are of little use without sensor rules.  I used straight 
High-Guard combat for squadron actions, but for ship-to-ship battles or similar 
small engagements I would use a combination of Mayday movement rules and High 
Guard combat.  In Full-Scale High Guard combat the sensors were fairly 
lobotomized.  Sensors would allow the squadron commander to get initiative, and 
could be used as jammers against the other side\'s sensors.  Their main High 
Guard effect was sensors acted as Fire Directors for missiles.  The sensor 
would allow only a certain number of missiles to be controlled per turn.  In 
the "tactical" combat sensors would work to detect the target and to lock on, 
as well as to detect incoming missiles and other surprises (very similar to the 
2300AD sensor rules, though less complex).

2.  More Missile Information (Different Types?)
In the text of the ship description, I would include how many salvoes of 
missiles the ship carried.  Salvoes could be made up of any of several types of 
missile:  Contact, Proximity, Antiradiation, Nuclear Contact, Nuclear 
Proximity.  Contact missiles depended on pure explosive power to damage the 
target.  Proximity missiles would either explode when near a ship or lie in 
wait for a passing ship before exploding; filling space with lots of metal 
particles to damage the passing ship (due to relative velocities and other fun 
physis effects).  Antiradiation missiles were Contact missiles designed to home 
in on radiation or sensor signatures (no controller required!).  Nuclear 
Contact missiles were like normal contact missiles, but far more devastating.  
Nuclear Proximity Missiles acted like the normal Proximity Missile, but instead 
of fast-moving fragments they depended on EMP to damage their enemies.  Except 
for AntiRadiation Missiles, all missiles would require sensor assistance for 
control guidance to target.

3.  Point Defense Weapons
Like Sensors, I altered the USP to support Point Defense batteries.  These 
batteries were low-powerd lasers that lacked the range to acck other starships, 
but could be used to attack incoming missiles or fighters.  The advantage to 
these weapons was that the batteries fired twice in defense: once during the 
normal defensive fire portion of combat, and once as a "second chance" when a 
successful hit was scored by a missile.  The PD Lasers could also fire on 
nearby fighters at the end of movement.  And best of all for the bloodthirsty, 
the PD lasers made excellent antipersonnel weapons while the ship was in port.  
These lasers had the same characteristics as the standard lasers.

4.  Computers
I added volume differentiation by tech level to computers (Yes, you can have a 
TL6 Model 9 computer, but its Megahuge).  I assumed that the Computer included 
other controls and communications gear, so I was not overly bothered by some of 
the volume restrictions, but I did feel that volume could be sacrificed to get 
desired computer technology earlier.  One thing I did do was largely do away 
with Computer Programs.  They really did not seem to add much to the game.  
However, I see no reason why software cannot be left in the game for those 
people who like that sort of thing.

In General
I am very hopeful that at some point in the future an effort is made to provide 
FF&S-like design rules for the various starship and vehicle subsystems, which 
produce results consistent with your "Base-Level" starship rules.  I thought 
High Guard design was an order of magnitude better than Book 2 Design, and I 
thought that FF&S/Brilliant Lances was an order of magnitude better than High 
Guard.  I really liked the details given by FF&S, but I do appreciate the 
ease-of-use from High Guard.  Being greedya nd self-centered, I want the best 
of both worlds.  So hop to it!  I\'m part of the Instant Gratification 
Generation, after all, and I want to be gratified instantly.

Sreiously, though, I do wish you the best of luck Don & Co..  As you\'ve no 
doubt noticed, there are lots of opinions around here, and they only rarely 
agree with what you want to do at any given time.  Basically, I\'ll prbably do 
something similar to what I noted above whether its in T4 or not.  That\'s not 
going to stop me from buying T4, or using a lot of other T4 rules.  I was happy 
enough with the TNE rules, but I\'m fairly flexible.

I would favor: XX-0000000-000000-ABC for the simple reason that the
other stuff all stays in the same order as always.  Other than that,
pretty cool.  I\'d rather see the sensor/jammer factor just be scaled
straight to detection range (at "effective range," maybe (base
difficulty).  Add some DMs based on TL, config of target, etc. to get to
the special features of a specific system (eg: Scout sensors get a
beneficial DM for scanning planet surfaces from orbit (or something)).

Computer DMs would also apply, and you\'d need a certain computaional
ability (ie: factor) to generate fire control solutions at certain
ranges (ie:sensor factor).

Are these maximum possible range of lock-on?  If so, would you just
double (or some such) for gross bogey detection, etc.?

Explosive damage would almost always be small compared to the KE of the
missile (assuming multi-g ships and missiles).

I assume that this is "C" above.  I used "C" as Jamming, BTW.

I like this in some ways, but dislike it in others.  Lasers have always
been PD weapons.  It makes sense given the "only one type of weapon in
the USP" nature of the USP, I guess.  I\'d give them a DM on the damage
tables to reflect their lower strength, however----they have the same
stats because they fire lower powered pulses at higher ROFs.

I hate to be depressing here, but this reminds me a lot of conversation I
had with avid role players during the collapse of the boardgames market.
There are still a few boardgames companies out there, selling mostly to the
grognards (and a lot of transfer over into the computer games market) but
they have to fight hard -- on the other hand the market is probably pretty
stable these days.

So what\'s the average age in the roleplaying groups you know? -- bet its
higher than it used to be.

Now, I think that boardgamers did not work to extend their (our?)
demographic the way they should have.  A lot of us did not take the interest
in younger gamers that they should have.  And a lot of companies (SPI for
instance) tended to produce games for a more and more experienced and
dedicated gamers -- and painted themselves into a niche market.

I think the return to Traveller Mark 1 is a good idea.  The level of
complexity is perfectly good for NEW gamers -- the sort of gamers WE were
back in 1977.  What we should be doing is actively recruiting younger gamers
into the hobby, before we all go the way of the corner-clippers.

I know the complete MT errata is published somewhere on the net. Could
someone tell me where and how to get a copy.  How about FF&S errata,
is that available too?

Stable and stagnant, yes. :(

Les!  Great post!

This makes a lot of sense.  A lot of folks have been saying that the CT 
rules were OK for 1977, but what is needed for today\'s gamers is 
something more advanced - like FF&S/FF&S Light.  But the scenario you 
paint, based on the true story of the wargames market, has the ring of 
truth.  To expand the market, we need games that are easy to learn, yet 
interesting to play - as interesting as Classic Traveller has always been.

A couple of weeks ago, I noted in a post that TSR has always made 
efforts to appeal to two markets: the new gamers, and the dedicated 
gamers.  They have appealed to both of these markets since the inception 
of AD&D.  Throughout AD&D\'s history they have had products like Dungeon! 
and D&D (and now some sort of "AD&D Light" system), which offer new 
gamers a clear way to enter the complex world of AD&D (and despite the 
lack of complexity in each individual system (comat, magic, etc.), the game 
overall IS complex, if only for the fact that there are dozens of books 
- - even entire full-length books dedicated to single subjects) without a 
massive investment of money and time just to decide whether the game is 
something they will enjoy.

TSR\'s method has its merits, but I think the classic Traveller way of 
doing things (the core rules are easy to learn yet effective and 
complete, while replacement systems are sold separately for those who are 
interested) is more appropriate for a game lacking name recognition in 
the general population (I don\'t know how many times I\'ve said 
"role-playing games" and gotten a blank stare, only to get recognition 
when I say, "you know...like Dungeons and Dragons").  The average 
prospective gamer isn\'t going to want to put the effort into learning a 
"light" version of Traveller in hopes of getting some supposed benefit 
later when the "real" core rules are purchased.  With AD&D, they may do 
so, because they have some idea what AD&D is.  But Traveller just does 
not have that type of pull on non-role-players (nor many role-players, I 
would bet). 

If IG offers them a collection of rules that are straight-forward, easy 
to learn, and complete (and makes it clear that all official products may 
be played using nothing more than those rules) they may make that initial 
purchase.  Then, if they want to replace this system or that by buying 
an additional book, they can do so by their own choice /without learning 
any complex systems beyond those they wish to learn/.  Unlike with AD&D, 
it won\'t be an all-or-nothing proposition.  The basic rules will be the 
common denominator, while the complex rules will be the exception for 
those who enjoy additional realism and detail.

I honestly believe the CT system, with minor modifications, is the best 
system to use as the core rules.  I hope IG still agrees with me.

Hello,

I recently bought a copy of challenge #70, the GDW 20th Aniverisary issue.
When I turned to the Traveller News Service, all I found was a bunch of
scrambled junk.  What is this?  Does anyone else have this in their copies
or what?

     That depends.  I\'ve been playing Traveller since 1980, and in that
time, I\'ve never done any role-playing.  I\'m playing a *game*, not a
*role*.  Frankly, the fun for me was the "far future engineering."  The
characters were like chess pieces.  The nice thing was that Traveller
could accomodate both viewpoints.

 >societies should be based on an easy to use framework.

     Why can\'t we have both?  Simple basic rules, and insanely complex
add-ons?

My solution was to let robots replace crewmembers, but to give them (robots)
absolutely no initiative when routine operations were departed from.  In game
terms, ships with robots had their initiative severely crippled in combat,
and had negative modifiers for all emergency tasks.

This seemed to work satisfactorily.  A merchant on a safe, fixed route could
save money by using robots.  One in the Marches, with the possibility of
Vargr corsairs, or a tramp trader refueling at gas giants, would be better
off with expensive but flexible sapients.

I used the same general rule for robotic weapons.  Very good at "shoot

minimizing civilian casualties".

that, in order to succeed on the wider RPG market, Traveller *cannot* 
have a primarily military emphasis.  GDW came out of the wargaming end of 
things, and as version after version came out, Traveller got more and 
more military.  In fact, the Shattered Imperium seemed (at least to me) 
to be an excuse for more and more military campaigning, while making some 
other kinds of civilian adventuring a hell of a lot more difficult.

As a military RPG, T4 will fail.  It will die.  It has no chance.

I recognize that what I\'m saying may be anathema to a number of you.  You 
like designing combat ships, maybe you like playing Striker, whatever.  
Understand, though, that you are a rapidly-shrinking minority of the RPG 
community.  You, like me, probably started with wargames.  If so, you 
come to the RPG field with a very different cultural background than 
almost anyone born after 1975.  Wargaming, paper wargaming, is now a 
fringe market.  (I consult to a game store here in one of the best gaming 
markets in the country.  I know the numbers.)  Games like MT, TNE, and 
T:2000 failed in large part because there is no real market for 
military-based RPGs (with the possible exception of powered-armor-and-
big-guns Anime-type stuff).  And the market is getting *even smaller*.

If T4 is to survive, it *must* *not* be focused on military gaming.  If 
it looks like a military game, new RPGers will not buy it.  It needs to 
have civilian careers, ideas for exploration, for "culture-shock" gaming, 
for merchanting -- and those need to be right up front, even if that 
means shunting some of the military stuff to the background.  The plan to 
do different backgrounds works well with this.

I\'m not saying that the military gaming aspect should be eliminated -- 
just that concentrating on military gaming will chase away potential 
players, while exciting only those who already love Traveller.  Imperium 
Games should avoid falling back into GDW\'s focus on warfare, if it 
doesn\'t want to fall like GDW did.  If T4 is to succeed, it must attract 
the non-military, role-playing-intensive, segment of the RPG market.  
That\'s the segment that is growing, while the old wargamers get older and 
older, have kids, and drift out of the hobby.  (And the new wargamers 
never leave their computer screens.)

That is the virus of Traveller The New Era asserting itself and taking over
the News Services.  Communications started breaking up in Challenge 69 and
resulted in what you see in Challenge 70.  By Challenge 71 communication is
just beginning to come back to normal at the end of the News Service article.
 If you pick up a copy of Survival Margin: Gateway to the New Era, it shows
this pretty good with reprints of  the Traveller News Service from 1116 to
1130 along with personal communications from the Emperor and other reprints
from Challenge.  In Challenge 72 the Traveller News Service is replaced with
the CINetwork Coalition Information Network and the year has jumped to 1201. 

 Welcome the the New Era :).

    'body' => 'I was just thinking of how my group played Traveller for the first few 
years.  We didn\'t design ships at all.  We just used stock ships from the 
Deluxe Traveller (Starter Edition) rules book.  Once I purchased 
supplement 7: Traders and Gunboats, we used those designs.  Although we 
had High Guard, we only used it for character generation.  I owned 
Supplement 9, too, but it just sat on the shelf.

None of us liked the starship combat rules.  They seemed way too 
complex.  We were there to role-play, not fight a wargame.  We wanted 
something quick, easy, and fun.  So, I made some modifications.

Out went the software rules.  I crossed all defensive weapons off the 
lists.  I got rid of all offensive weapons other than beam lasers.  You 
could put from one to three beam lasers on a turret.  Fire that turret, 
and the only DM\'s were plus gunner skill and minus the opponant\'s pilot 
skill.  No ranges, no maneuvering tactics.

When rolling for hit location, a DM of +1 was allowed if two beam lasers 
were on the turret that scored the hit.  If it had three beam lasers, the 
DM was +2.  The player had the option of taking the whole DM, part of it, 
or none at all.  There were no DM\'s to the critical hit chart.

Then I made up rules for specific ship repair costs (hull breach costs, 
for example).  

That was all there was to it.  

And we had a ball.  We actually began looking forward to space combat.  
I designed some adventures around it.  Heck, we even ran some space 
combats outside of the adventure context, just because it was fun!

A few years later, having had all these good experiences with space 
combat, we took another look at the basic rules.  We instituted those for 
a while, then jumped right into High Guard.  It was great, and we loved 
the added depth of play.  We even designed a few starships using the HG 
rules.  Finally, we had learned the value of complexity.

Maybe this will prove useful to IG in determining the direction to take 
Traveller (ie, whether to use their stated goal of a return to CT, or to 
go with something more complex for the basic rules).  Maybe it will also 
remind us all of the way we were way back when. :)  It takes time for new 
gamers to work up to complex systems.  I would like them to have that 
opportunity.

I\'m not advocating using my extremely simple system.  That would be a 
sure way to drive a lot of potential customers and new gamers away! :)  
But a system such as is given in Book 2 would be good. It is simple 
enough that a person new to gaming can modify it into something s/he 
likes better.  And later, when they decide they want something with a 
bit more to it, that system will be there.  Finally, they will be able 
to upgrade to the most complex system, be it HG or FF&S based.

I like the idea of offering a detailed version of /every/ Traveller 
system, including ship design.  And for me personally, if T4 has a system 
I don\'t like it is no problem.  I\'ll either design my own or use a CT 
system instead.  Either way, I don\'t lose.  

I just don\'t want to see potential customers turned away because they are 
daunted by an overly complex core rules system.  Most people aren\'t going 
to be as passionate about Traveller as we all are.  To them, it is just 
a game - a diversion - not something to spend a lot of time on.

Anyway, enough blathering.  

Thanks for reading,

I gotta agree.  Universal profiles aren\'t bad for 6 string 
characteristics, and the UWP\'s, but the nearly 30 digit strings used 
in High Guard are tedious to work with...the learning curve is steep.

lot of suggestions have been put forth, but it sounds like most people 
have many contacts in many game stores in their area.  My situation is a 
bit different.  I\'ve only lived here for a few years, so I don\'t have the 
advantage I would if I were still in northern CA, where I grew up.

In addition, where I live (northeastern Illinois), there aren\'t a whole 
lot of RPG stores (Games+ is the only one I know of in Lake County).  
There\'s Gamers\' Paradise, but they seem to be concentrating on videogames, 
puzzles, board games, and other non-RPG stuff.  Plus, their RPG section 
leaves much to be desired.  Take out the AD&D stuff and the Games 
Workshop stuff, and you don\'t have much left.  This is even more true of 
the area comic book shops.  They carry AD&D and a few White Wolf 
products, and that\'s about it.  

Given that, how in the heck is Traveller going to gain a wide audience 
around here?  I can\'t go to these stores and tell them all that I want 
them to carry T4 because I\'ll buy it from them - I\'m not going to lie to 
get them to carry the game.  I can go there and talk to them about this 
great new/old game that is coming out, but from the existing product 
selection, I have doubts that would be effective.

I am sure that Games+ will carry it (they carry everything - even a 
surprising amount of out-of-print stuff).  Gamers\' Paradise is a chain, 
so I don\'t think working on them would do much good.  I think the best 
chance lies with the independently owned comic book shops.  Perhaps I 
should just go in and talk to the owner, eh?  I don\'t know these people, 
though.  Are they going to listen to me?

Is anyone else in a situation similar to mine?  What are your plans?  Any 
recommendations?

Thanks,

I\'m in the same boat as you are. I live in South Jersey, and there are only
a couple of comic book stores, and they only carry AD&D stuff. I suppose
I could find someplace in Philadelphia to buy games, but it\'s been easier
for me to just order stuff from Wargames West, who carries everything. I
wouldn\'t know the first thing to tell one of these small store-owners. I
don\'t even have a group to play with anymore (when I graduated from
college in 1993, everybody split up), so, yes, I\'ll buy the new game, but
until I find another group to referee, I\'m not going to be much of a support
person for it.

These small guys can only afford to stock what will sell. The question we
have to deal with is, will the new Traveller sell? Thats up to the marketing
people, I think. We all got into Traveller when we were kids and had time
to spend coming up with these grandiose campaigns. Now we\'re grown
and have families and the time just isn\'t there. Can Traveller be marketed
successfully to today\'s RPG\'ers? I believe so, because AD&D started
with our generation, and still is successful today. The decision is more in
the hands of IG than it is in ours. 

Am I right or am I completely off my rocker? :)

 Which is more official for the capital of the People\'s Republic of
 China - "Peking" or "Beijing"?

 That\'s about how I view this kind of difference - both "Massilia"
 and "Massila" are reasonable "Galanglicizations" of the Vilani
 name for the sector, "Masilaa".

Just as an aside; I friend of mine who is a native of Hong Kong (yes, he
*is* desperately trying to find a way to become a permanent resident of
the USA) when asked the Peking/Beijing question replied that one was Man-

Hi All.  The discussion on sonic stunners has been missing a fundamental 
point: differing atmospheric densities.  Depending on what world you were 
on and what the weather conditions were, the stunner would have to be 
calibrated differently.  This would be quite a complex thing, though not 
outside the capabilities of a small computer and air-pressure sampling 
device.  You would also have to calibrate the stunner based on race (and 
perhaps the size of the opponent?).  A sonic stunner would not work in 
vacuum or trace atmospheres, and would probably have difficulty in very 
thin ones.  Depending on the exact nature of exotic atmospheres, there might 
be problems here as well.  Also, rain and snow might have adverse 
effects.  When in water or dense atmospheres, the stunner might have 
better range, though it would have to be properly adjusted.

This sort of calibration problem is common with other non-lethal weapons
as well.  Tranq rounds, for instance, have to be adjusted to body 
size of opponent as well as species.  This is why lethal weapons are favored

working on that, but this has so captured my attention that I\'m going
to get squat done until I get this out of the way.

I don\'t present this process as *the* way to go.  All I want to do is
stimulate some thought about the process.  Something detailed enough
to please the FF&S people, but easy enough for the rest of us.

What I\'m proposing is to create ships from standard parts that can be
picked from tables and plugged together.   This doesn\'t differ much
from the FF&S lite concept, but I think my pieces  are less finely
grained.  I\'m also coming at this from a CT/HG/MT direction rather
than FF&S.

                        Simple Ship Design

1.  Set Ship\'s main function:  Scout, Merchant, Combat, etc.

2.  Decide base tech level

3.  Choose standard hull size (increments of 100 Tons).

4.  Pick Bridge Package from Bridge Table.
       (Each Bridge Package includes basic controls, equipment &
        workspace for basic Command and Control functions:  Comm,
        Sensors, Computer, Security, Maneuver, Jump, &
        Astrogation.)

5.  Optional Bridge additions:
    a.  Communications
    b.  Sensors
    c.  Computer
    d.  Security
    e.  Screens
    f.  Aux controls

6.  Pick Engineering Package from Engineering Table    
       (Each Engineering Package includes basic controls &
        workspace for power generation, maneuver drive, jump
        drive, & a basic repair shop.)

7.  Optional Engineering additions:
    a.  Machine Shop
    b.  Electronic Shop
    c.  Weapons Shop
    d.  Gravtics Shop
  
8.  Jump Drive
    a.  Pick Jump Drive for the J factor desired and for the hull
        size from the Jump Drive Table.
    b.  Volume of fuel needed for 1 jump = (Vol of Jump Drive) * 5       


9.  Maneuver Drive
    a.  Pick Maneuver Drive for the G factor desired and for the
        hull size from the Maneuver Drive Table.    
    
10. Install Weapons Systems from Weapon Tables.
        (I\'m not going to detail this here. Surfice it to say
         we\'re talking about standard plug in weapons like in the
         example.)
        
        
11. Install Defensive Systems from Tables
        (Same as with Weapons.  The tables would have plug in
         systems.)


12. Pick number of standard Accommodations from Accom Table.
    a.  Low Berths
    b.  Bunks
    c.  Small Staterooms
    d.  Large Staterooms
    e.  Commons Areas

13. Gravity Control
    a.  GVOL = Sum of volumes under gravity control
    b.  Look up Grav Ctrl factors P and C from Gravtic Table
    c.  Calculate Power required = GVOL*P
    d.  Calculate Cost = GVOL*C

14. Life Support
    a.  LVOL = Sum of volumes under gravity control
    b.  Look up Life Support factors P and C from LF Table
    c.  Calculate Life Support power required = LVOL*P
    d.  Calculate Life Support cost = LVOL*C
        
15. Power System
    a.  PwrReq = (Sum of power required)*1.5 for safety
    b.  Add enough standard Generators to exceed PwrReq, look on
        Power Systems Table
    c.  This is PwrAvail

16. Fuel for Maneuver Drive, Weapons and Ship Systems
    a.  How many weeks of fuel?
    b.  (fuel/hr from Power Systems Table)*PwrAvail*Weeks*168
    
17. Determine current volume

18. Misc
    a.  Increased Compartmentalization: +1% current volume
    b.  Streamlining for atmospheric flight: +1% current volume
    c.  Bracing for landing on planets: +1% current volume

19. Cargo Space
    a.  Total current volume
    b.  Cargo = ((Hull Size)*14) - current volume
        (This is the cubic meters of cargo space to figure the
         tons divide this number by 14.)

20. Fill out a Standard Ship Form.


And here\'s an example I built with the process...

Folks, I haven\'t got all these tables completed.  That\'s something for
Don to do..or maybe for us to do here. <g> 

Right now the tables consist, in most cases, of 1 entry..the 1 entry I
used to produce my example..and that entry is more a skeleton than a
complete body. Here\'s an example...

        The Bridge Package Table 

        Volume    Pwr Req   Crew   Cost
       in cub M    in MW    Req   in Mcr
Pack1    168        8.0      2     18.0

[probably should use tons instead of cubic meters??]


Pack1 consists of (at the tech level you\'ve chosen):

  Standard Comm package:    System Radio
                            Laser Tightbeam
                            
  Standard Sensor pack:     Passive EMS Interstellar
                            Active EMS Far Orbit              

  Computer:     1/bis
                4 bridge consoles
  
  Standard Life Support Control
  
  Standard Security Control
  
  Standard Gravtics Control    
  
  Flight Control (for Maneuver and Jump)
      Pilot Station
  
      Co-Pilot Station
  
  Astrogation Table
- ----  

Does this give you an idea of what I mean by a Package?  

The Jump Drives would be discrete units designed to boost a given
volume into jump space.

Maneuver Drives would also be a discrete unit based on standard
volume.

Power Generators (Fusion Plants really) would be standard sized units
that produce a standard power out and use a standard amount of
fuel/hr.  I based mine on a standard 6 (2x2x1.5) cubic meter size
using cold fusion to generate 4MW, admittedly this didn\'t come from
any canonical source.

The details could be designed down to as fine a point as you want. 
The data could be presented on a level not much more detailed than CT. 
It could also be *very* detailed.

Ok, does this make sense to anybody?  Is this too complicated? To
simple?  Should I just go back to my star systems and forget this?

Whoa!  I *really* don\'t think that\'s likely to happen.  <g> I sort of
depend on the UPs presenting stuff in a standard order.

I understand how you feel.  I have the same problem..don\'t we all?  So
get inventive!

What I try to do, when I can, is to transfer UP\'s onto forms I\'ve made
up.  UP stuff goes in vertically with a short discription to the left,
and more detail to the right.  That way I don\'t have to remember/look
up what each number means, and I have a record I can store and where I
can make changes.  Here are a couple of examples of what I mean.

Below these headers I\'d go into more detail as necessary.  See what I
mean?

I also have other standard data that I include, I put that at the
bottom of the canon UPs. (I would have said GDW instead of canon, but
I guess that\'s not appropriate anymore...and IGs not appropriate yet.

I think I\'m part of the vast majority.  Fifteen to twenty years ago, when I
was in college and especially between college and grad school, I did spend
hours and hours polishing and tweaking HG and Striker designs, but not any
more (kind of like my friends who had old sports cars:  "If I can just find
an original rear-view mirror and rebuild the photonic transducer, it\'ll be
almost cherry").  

On the other hand, I don\'t object to time-consuming detail, if someone
else\'s time is consumed.  So I\'ll buy ship and vehicle designs and deck
plans by the score and have them available to use "off the shelf".

Of course.  <g> The Johnson/Lewis 2T-4MW is but one model that would
be available on a table.  I\'m with you on larger size models, but not
too many, or you lose the economy of
*manufacturing* scale!  One or two at the 4 to 8 level, the 30 to 40
level and the 100 to 200 level, maybe.  Power Plant designs can be
created and published like anything else.

Now the but...

1.  My ship is being built on Kittle Prime by Drise and Son,
Shipbuilders.  I want to built inexpensively, so they are using as
many "off the shelf" parts as possible.  They happen to have 40, 4MW
generators in stock left over from some system boat work they were
doing for the local navy and so...<g>

2.  Seriously, I visualize Traveller ships to be a good bit like steam
ships early this century.  All large steam ships had multiple
boilers..why?  So one could be taken down for service or repair and
still have 3/4, 1/2 power.  Warships, especially, would want
redundancy.

>plant, and have a little excess capacity, or I can install a 75MW, a
>10MW and a 5MW. Whichever combination took less volume and cost less.

I\'d try to get ship designers to avoid that if possible.  I think 3 to
6 "boilers" of the same model would be better:  easier to repair;
interchangeable parts; less training/maintenance overhead for the
engineer.

You\'ve added a *lot* since I dropped by last week!  <g> I dled all
your pages tonight..this morning so I can study them off line.  

Two things to think about...

First, I think some of your systems might be too finely grained. Group
*everything* needed for a 3 or 4 standard bridges together and make
that a plug in.  Let folks customize by adding on enhanced
controls/computers/sensors as a more advanced process. It looks like
you\'re doing that for weapon systems already.

Second, we always pick the hull size & configuration first..what if we
didn\'t?  What if we did it backwards:  

1. picked out all the systems that go into the ship

2. put in a plant to power them

3. put in a maneuver drive 

4. put in tanks for the fuel

6. put in a jump drive and fuel for it

5. put in a minimum cargo area

6. added it all up and picked the next biggest hull

Would that be easier for everybody than having to keep fiddling trying
to fit everything in a 800ton hull?

I can\'t do anymore tonight!

Yes!  This is what I advocated in my previous post.  Provide basic 
components in a few charts, with notes that they are of such-and-such 
configuration, and this will solve the compatability issue.  Sure, 
provide all the statistics but don\'t require the user to make design 
decisions on each statistic.  For example:

Standard Hulls Table

Tons	Main	Drives	Max. Accel.	Configuration	MCr	Time
100	85	15	2G		Needle		2	9
100	75	25	4G		Wedge		3	9
200	185	15	1G		Sphere		8	11
200	175	25	2G		Cylinder	9	11
...etc...

Include some basic configurations.  Additional ones could be included in 
a supplement, in JTAS, or whatever.  This sort of table would provide all 
the information required to reconstruct the exact same thing under the 
full system, with the same result in time, cost, etc.  Obviously, I 
didn\'t include everything (ie, armor) in the above table, but it could be 
done (I just took the table in Book 2, and modified it based on what is 
required for a full-up system, and also what sort of drive compartment 
size is required to fit a standard drive that would allow the given-sized 
hull to achieve the acceleration given as the maximum).  A gearhead could 
do a much better job of constructing such a table, I know.  This is just 
a quick-n-dirty example for illustration.

Pardon my ignorance, but what is a "storytelling-style combat resolution 
system?"  Any resemblence to the Book 2 system?

Yes, it would!  Good idea.

Sounds good, so long as one of the above is something like Book 2...

	1) I agree that the Military side of Traveller MUST be
downplayed.  CT was very good at being a \'generic hard s-f\' game
system, and it was hailed as such.  It\'s time to go back to that.  
Maybe it has to do with the RPG population becoming more mature and
realizing that guns can kill people, and htat\'s not so funny?
Anyways, I could never interest the players in a purely
combat-orientated adventure, unless the characters were really
interesting (Say, something like \'The Eagle has Landed\' or really
quirky people).

the time either!  UPPs are really useful for computer stuff, but
there\'s no way a player who\'s only there for a couple of hours of fun
is going to bother learning what the 30 digits of a ship design
means... All they care about is \'Are we going to die?\'?  :)
So I hope that only the stuff that really can\'t go in another format
goes into the UP\'s... 

	3)  Ship design.  Well, in my opinion it should be MODERATELY
complex.  Why?  Because for one thing, only the referee OR a player
truly interested will bother with it.  If it\'s too simple, they\'ll be
dissapointed.  If it\'s too complex, they\'re going to drop parts of it
anyway.  
	What SHOULD be included in the base rules is a s system for
quickly rolling up a ship when the ref is in a bind.  Say your
players go off you map and you roll a random ship encounter for a
type you don\'t have plans for.  You\'re not going to design it on the
spot.  What you need are tables to generate what the PLAYER\'S
perception of the ships will be.  That will be data coming out of
sensor scans or things that the players can see with their own eyes.

So basically what you do is have a 3 column table:
Dice roll  Ship Type	Hull Volume
2	   Shuttle	50
3	   Scout	100
...
7	   Cruiser	400
...
12	   Fleet Cargo	200000
So the ref can either roll up a size randomly or if he already has an
idea of the type of ship, he can go up to the line for a \'reasonable\'
size for that ship.  Make the same tables for the other systems.

Now obviously these numbers will be only approximations - but that\'s
my point.  There is NO way a character will know precisely to the
last decimal the actual hull size of any ship, unless they\'re naval
architect.  Go to the Entreprise Aircraft Carrier and tell me what
you think the hull size is - nobody will come up with the same
numbers.
So the referee can fudge things this way.  And if he actually ever
NEEDS the correct numbers, he can design the ship later.

This is, in any case, something that I would use.  (Of course the
final tables would be more complex than that - 1000 kL hulls won\'t
use 2 MW power plants :).

4) Getting Traveller Support;  I have yet to reply to Mr Collin\'s
letters about how to get the stores to support T4, but I do have a
few ideas.  For instance, tell the owners WHO is working on the new
rules.  Most RPG store owners have some knowledge of the \'stars\' of
rpgs, like Elmore and such.  Print out the \'crew roster\' of IG found
on their web site and hand it out to the store owner.  Bring some
samples of the art/writings/games.  You should be able to get THEM to
be excited about the product. :)

Of course, even Leonardo Da Vinci must have made some turkeys in his
own time... :)  But you can sell anything as long as it has at least
one saving grace, like good art or a good system or whatever. :)

Sorry for rambling on like this. :)  

These are just my opinions, and they do not reflect those of my
employer, unless you\'re hiring. :)

Yes, it was all presented in separate books....which weren\'t available 
right away.  It took years for all that history to accumulate in many 
different books.

The original set, as it says on the back of the box it comes in, was 
designed to allow one to recreate the universe of "any of the many 
science-fiction novels available, with the action following the story 
line, or diverging when something interesting happens."  It was only 
later that the Imperium background was made available to players.

Seeing as how TV ads aren\'t likely to be seen over here (unless you 
put them on, say, MTV Europe ;-) those don\'t come noticeably high on 
my list.
Overall, I guess print ads (with nice art, but then, you\'ve 
got both Foss and Elmore, so that should be easy ;-) are most likely 
to catch my attention. But I seldom buy without having seen a product 
reviewed in a reputable mag. The word of a mag like, say, Pyramid 
means a lot to where I spend my gaming Kronor...
A nicely formated press-release/ad (maybe as a postscript file) is 
certainly something I\'d bring to the local shop. I think he\'d respond 
better to a direct mail from ImperialGames, but he listens to his 
customers. (Maybe you should take a leaf from SJG and put a form up 
on the web where you can get adresses to retail stores? After all, 
even if you manage the distribution, individual stores still need to 
find out you exist.)
Color ads in the classier computer gaming mags (CGW, Strategy+) would 
probably also be worthwile as many strategy gamers come from an 
rpg/boardgame background. You might even get one of them to give you 
at least a capsule review. Strategy+ has done that before on 
non-computer related stuff they liked.
Could even be worthwhile to put clickable ads on places like Games 
Domain. Perhaps.

My only comment on this is that I - and my players, back when we last 
ran Traveller  - *like* the possibility of a completely pc-crewed 
ship. No npc, no robots, no \'extra characters\', nothing. This, of 
course, is strictly from a playability perspective...

I\'m also inordinately fond of \'single-ship\' scouts. I just like the 
concept. Guess I\'m weird. ;-)

There should be some way to make ships require less crew by \'throwing 
money at the problem\'. (And vice versa for that matter...) If it\'s 
customizable, I\'ll agree with whatever rules set is decided on.

Well, I have CT in three different formats, Small Book, 8x10 format books, and the Hardbound.  I use the hardbound almost exclusivlly.  It has some additional art work not found in the little books, and has a couple of adventure seeds in the back, in part half of the Double adventure Shadows/Annic Nova (it has Shadows).  It also has an NPC that was published in JTAS as an adventure seed.

I would get it for the art, and for the durability.  Use the small books for the players, and you use the hard back when you ref.

represent the results in a compact format, such as High Guard\'s Universal
Ship Profile (USP).  However, limitations of the USP format were one of
the things driving the (IMHO) rather artificial limitations on ship
weaponry (you couldn\'t have bay or turret particle accellerators if you
had a spinal installation, because there was only one position for
particle accellerators).

SO, I propose breaking out the offensive weapons into separate groups for
spinal (two digits), bay (four types), and turret (four types).  Theese
new groups would replace the existing five-place offensive weapon group
in the USP.  The defensive weapons don\'t need breaking out like this,
because they can only be installed in one type of mount (sandcasters only
come in turret installations, repulsors are so large they must be mounted
in bays; and all the rest are internal).  In the examples below, I\'ve also
added the sensor/EW group that was proposed recently.


Old USP Examples:

BC-9514 Kinunir  BC-A2447G2-000510-50202-0  MCr1336.63  1250 Tons

        batteries            A   N  1    Z AXA


Here\'s the complete breakdown of the new USP format:
XX-@@@@  Example  XX-1234567-89ABCD-EF-GHIJ-KLMN-O-PQRS  MCr$$$$$$  ### Tons

Ship Identification:
XX = Ship Type code
@@@@ = Ship Number
Example = Ship Name

General Information:
1 = Tonnage code
2 = Comfiguration code
3 = Jump Number
4 = Maneuver G\'s
5 = Power Plant rating (is this still needed?)
6 = Computer Code (or computer DM, perhaps?)
7 = Crew code

Defense:
8 = Hull Armor factor
9 = Sandcaster Turret factor
A = Meson Screen factor
B = Nuclear Damper factor
C = Force Field (black globe) factor
D = Repulsor Bay factor

Spinal Weapons:
E = Spinal Particle Accellerator factor
F = Spinal Meson Gun factor

Bay Weapons:
G = Energy Weapon Bay (plasma and fusion gun, if still used) factor
H = Particle Accelerator Bay factor
I = Meson Gun Bay factor
J = Missile Bay factor

Turret Weapons:
K = Laser Turret Battery factor
L = Energy Weapon Turret Battery factor
M = Particle Accelerator Barbette factor
N = Missile Turret Battery factor

Fighters:
O = Number of fighter squadrons

Electronic Warfare:
P = Active Sensor factor
Q = Passive Sensor factor
R = Active Jammer (ECM) factor
S = Stealth and EMM factor

Additional Information:
$$$$$$ = Cost in MegaCredits (to six significant figures)
### = Exact tonnage, in displacement tons.


Despite the complexity of decoding the USP (I drew up special ship control
sheets that helped immensely in my own games), I think it\'s important to
have a compact format for representing everything important about a ship.
The longer descriptions, particularly those used in MegaTraveller, always
seemed cumbersome when attempting to compare ship designs.

I heartily second this!  In the MT days I greatly preferred the Digest
Group supplements to the GDW ones.  Traveller\'s Digest published many non-
military adventures, and Digest Group published supplements like Rats &
Cats while GDW was busy publishing Fighting Ships of the Shattered
Imperium and COACC. 

I am excited about the Year 0 era.  I dearly hope that the focus will be
on exploration and recontact and trade, rather than conquest.

Your design sequence isnt half bad.  FF&S could be useful.  It comes down to this:

   Don\'t make me have to use a calculator.  

If I can\'t to the math quickly in my head, it isn\'t useful.  A prime example is 
Cargo is listed in tons, but you have to convert it to cubic meters to see if it 
will fit in your cargo bay.  Before: 150 Ton cargo hold = 150 tons cargo.  Its 
easy.  Now I have to take 150 Tons multiply it by some constant that isn\'t in my
head (takes time to look up) and then I have to compare at this point two 
numbers with some fractional value to another.  This complexity for reality sake
was a mistake.  It took away from playability.

Try to avoid fractions and numbers that are difficult to work with.  Instead
of a jump drive taking 19.8 "tons" of space, and costing 27.3 Mcr (numbers made up a random), have it use 20 tons of space and cost 27 Mcr.  Heck of a lot easier to deal with.

That\'s why I hate FF&S (other than you can\'t follow from one step to another easily).  Give me tables with whole numbers and don\'t make me do anything more complex that Multiply.  I am not adversed to math.  But when I am refing, I don\'t want to deal with math.

It seems that I have been swayed by the myriad of discussions here on the
Traveller and the XBoat mailing lists. I\'m willing to give FF&S Light a
try. Dave Golden (goldendj@mail.usa.net) has volunteered to coordinate the
design of this system. Please email comments and suggestions to him.

FF&S (and Light) will need a method of creating a USP however. The basic
combat system will still be High Guard-like. The changes will probably
include two more range bands (a la Battle Rider - short, medium, long,
extreme). In fact, Battle Rider could be used as a semi-basis for this
method. See what you come up with. Also, the design of starships using FF&S
Light should take from 15 minutes to 30 minutes to complete. No more.

I\'ve given Dave until Friday to come up with a working model of the FF&S
Light system, including the USP generation sub-system. If I accept the
system, then this is what will happen:

        The Main Book will contain some stock ship designs, their USP\'s,
        and the Modified High Guard combat system.

        The Starships book will contain more stock ship designs, their deck
        plans, their USP\'s, the FF&S Light building system, and some other
        stuff.

        Later, we\'ll publish FF&S (updated) again under a new name.

This would mean that FF&S is the system for developing starships. You can
still use it. FF&S Light will be used by new players, and those not
interested in the level of detail from FF&S. Tech levels for jump drives,
et al, are as per FF&S. Ignore what I said earlier.

BTW, fusion is a little strange around year 0. The fusion from FF&S is what
we call "Fusion Plus". Before year 0, no one had Fusion Plus, only fusion.
What this means for ships over 100 tons is - nothing. However, the power
plant necessary for a 100 ton ship is as small as it could get.
Effectively, there were no starships of less than 100 tons. Then came the
Empire, and they invented Fusion Plus. Now they can build a 10 ton fighter,
a 50 ton modular cutter, a ship\'s boat, etc. Other people can only build
100 ton shuttles or the like. Now you can see why so many people wanted to
join the Empire back in Milieu 0.

For those of you who expressed an interest in designing ships for me,
please hold off until Friday to see what the design system will look like.
You could, however, use FF&S to design the ships, if you like. I\'m looking
for TL11 ships for Civilian service and TL12 ships for government/military
service. I\'d prefer to have deck plans in some .eps style format, if
possible. Use 2 meters per square, if you will. The plans must fit on an 8"
by 10" page (or, for large ships, two pages.)

Thank you for your support and encouragement. Let\'s get to work!

Just a quick question:  Which should we use for maneuver drives,
thruster plates or HEPLaR drives?

Hi Tom: 

Part of the beauty of the Classic Traveller books was that the Imperium was
not integrated into the rules. This means that I did not have to spend alot
of time taking it out of the rules. 

Personally I created my own universe rather than use the Imperium.

You build ships on the fly during a game to work encounters, etc?  I
always tried to have either premade ships handy (sup.7, sup.9) or I kept
a notebook of my own designs.  If I needed something I wasn\'t prepared
for, I made it up, then designed it later if the players would ever see
it again (the USP wasn\'t something I\'d give players during an encounter
unless it was a common ship in thier database----and they got close
enough to get accurate sensor data on that level of detail).  Someone
mentioned a gross encounter table... that works fine.  Who needs
detailed data for a one time encounter with a cruiser?  

Player> What do our sensors say about the ship hailing us?

Me> They are broadcasting Imperial Navy Ship ID.  They are a 50,000ton
cruiser.  

Player> can we run/fight? (a point of information request)

Me> Hahahaha.  No.  Their launches could wreak your ship.  Standard
proceedure would be to answer the hail.

HG doesn\'t do more than multiply as an operation, and has little algerba
(EPs and agility spring to mind).

I think that the system for people who want to generate ships with no
math is simple, and is already in place----use premade ships!

For basic play, MT and FFS were too complicated.  HG was just about
right.  Again, there are a ton of premade ships, and if you\'re
interested in mAking ships I would rather see a system at least
complicated enough that I couldn\'t memorize the whole set of rules
including tables :-)

        That\'s not my understanding from Don. While the mechanics are going
to be the same, I don\'t think there\'s any intention of "altering" FF&S in
that drastic a manner. In fact, FF&S should be left virtually unchanged.

        Certainly. We want to keep the detailed FF&S units in FF&S, but we
need a way to convert an FF&S laser\'s "Rng: Pen-Dmg" to some kind of
single-digit combat factor.

        Some things definitely need tweaking, such as crew. I\'m inclined to
use the FF&S crews as "low-automation" and come up with a simple multiplier
for automation effects. But at the same time, we need to do this fast, and
with as little change to FF&S as possible.

        High Guard uses to-hit, to-penetrate, and then damage rolls (had to

        Rule of thumb, or perhaps just "Imperial Ministry of Commerce and
Transportation" regulation for civilian craft licensing. Anyway, weapons are
still going to be limited by surface area as per FF&S.

        My understanding is we\'re sticking very closely to FF&S. I
specifically asked about having multiple drive tables, but didn\'t think to
clarify whether the "standard" would remain HEPlaR or revert to thruster
plates. I\'ll ask about that.

        The one subject where FF&S is open for changes! By now you\'ve read
Don\'s message about the nature of fusion plants at TL11 ... too big for
ships much smaller than 100tons. We\'ve got to come up with some rationale,
handwaving or not, for this, so we don\'t get stuck with an arbitrary "before
TL12 thou shalt not have fusion in small craft." Anybody got any ideas about
a physics breakthrough in fusion technology that won\'t necessarily increase
the power density, but will allow smaller minimum sizes?

        FF&S Light will consist _mostly_ of tables of "standard _____s." And
since most ships will probably have an odd power requirement, chances are
good there will be multiple pplants: say you need 87MW: put in three 25MW
plants and a 15MW plant...

        Good idea ... I\'ll see if I can tweak the hull tables some more. I\'m

        I\'m leaning toward recommending that FF&S crew levels be taken as a
"low-automation" level, due to Virus. Pre-Collapse crews will be smaller.
Maybe just a simple fraction of the "book" levels, by TL perhaps. Suggestions?

        Well, even a custom designed system will probably be designed around
mostly standard-type parts. But if you just define repair costs as a
fraction of the original cost, then the higher original cost will drive
higher repair costs without a separate rule.

        Custom designs are coming <G>. In fact, they\'re still here.

    'body' => 'Everybody\'s seen Don Perrin\'s message by now, saying that my big mouth got
me into the hot water. I\'ve got until Friday to come up with a basic working
model of "Fire, Fusion & Steel Light." I need some serious help to do this.
During my talks with Don Perrin this morning, here\'s the guidance I got:

	1) "Fire, Fusion & Steel" (FF&S) _will be_ the detailed spacecraft design
supplement for MMT, with little change. He doesn\'t want a wholesale rewrite.
Only if something is seriously broken will it be tweaked. However! If it
does get fixed, it needs those fixes identified NOW so they are incorporated
into the "Light" version. IG will eventually reissue FF&S, and any updates
will be made available on the Net for those who already have it.

	2) Combat will be "High Guard-style," using single-digit ratings for
systems in a Universal Ship Profile, and separate to-hit/to-penetrate tables
instead of tasks. So we need to come up with a way of converting detailed
statistics into single-digit type ratings. But we\'re not rewriting FF&S to
look like HG. My understanding is that the combat rules will *not* be
straight out of "Book 5, 2nd Edition" as far as actual values, etc., just
that the mechanics themselves will be very similar. As an intermediate step,
the abstracted combat values in "Brilliant Lances" may be a good start for
generating USPs.

	4) The USP really shouldn\'t grow much bigger -- Don thinks it\'s probably
too long already. He\'s talking about coming up with some way to roll ALL the
offensive and defensive systems into a single factor each, i.e. Attack 7,
Defend 5. Just for the basic rules, folks, calm down. Something like
"Brilliant Lances" (and probably "Brilliant Lances") is also being planned,
and they\'ll use mechanics much like the existing ones, in all their glorious
detail. But a quick firefight in the middle of a roleplaying session
shouldn\'t break the momentum.

	5) Fusion power plants are one thing that needs fixing in FF&S. One of the
"hooks" in the Milieu 0 setting is the idea of "Fusion Plus." Ok, it\'s not a
very catchy phrase, but here\'s the basic idea. The commonly available fusion
plants are big. You really can\'t build them small enough for a fighter, for
example. The Imperium, with a common TL of 11 but a military TL of 12 has
had a technology breakthrough which allows them to build much smaller plants
that can fit into fighters (or other small craft). The new plants don\'t
produce more power per unit mass; you can just build them smaller. One of
the reasons many "pocket empires" are willing to join the Imperium is this
technology. 
	So we need to tweak the fusion plant rules enough that it\'s not practical
to put them into ships much smaller than 100tons prior to TL12. I repeat,
they\'re not necessarily more efficient, they can just be made smaller after
TL12. I _seriously_ need some inputs on this one, folks.

	6) The variety in armor materials, maneuver drives, etc. will be kept.
However, the basic design rules need to be structured to make design as much
as possible a "Pick a system, deduct its volume from the running total, add
its price, mass and power requirements to the total, and press on."

	7) "Basic Working Model" means all tables basically complete. Prose to make
it look good can be added later, as long as the system is testable now.

	8) If possible, don\'t pester Don about spacecraft design, he\'s probably
busy with the combat rules. I get all the hate mail now.

	9) I\'ll follow discussions on all three lists (Beta, Traveller and XBoat)
as soon as I get resubscribed to the XBoat. If you sent a message on XBoat
before receiving this, I didn\'t get it. I\'ll probably get three or four
copies of every message as people echo them to all the lists, but it\'s
easier and quicker than asking everybody to join just one of the lists for
the discussion. I need everybody\'s ideas.

	10) I\'ll keep copies of work-in-progress on my Web site at 

		http://www.usa.net/~goldendj/Traveller/Admiralty/FFSLight/FFSLight.html

	What\'s there right now isn\'t yet the latest version, as I\'m in the middle
of changes, but I\'ll get it up soon.


SUMMARY: We\'re _not_ designing a new system, nor doing wholesale surgery on
FF&S. We\'re taking the existing rules and coming up with a simplified system
for quick & dirty designs. And we\'re doing it fast, so there\'s not much time
to squabble. My basic plan of attack is to convert all the FF&S rules to a
set of tables from which you can pick items. But I need input from
everybody, especially those who\'re most interested in a basic system.

        That\'s the goal: create "HG-style" USPs, not a High Guard version of
FF&S. The design system will remain FF&S -- all Light is is a set of
pregenerated FF&S systems.

        Small ships ... I was only planning on going up to about 5,000Td.
Most customers for bigger ships are going to be governments or megacorps
with detailed specs and more money. Plus, most shipyards aren\'t going to
have "standard" equipment big enough for the rare big ship.

        Well, Don seemed very firm about not changing FF&S. He did agree
that we can tweak it somewhat if absolutely needed, but no major revisions.

Possibly.  But consider how repairs work.  (Details thanks to an aviation
tech I know.)

Airplane lands with problems: that radar isn\'t working properly.

Tech pulls the three modules most likely to be broken and tests system.  If
it doesn\'t work, she repeats it with the next three modules.  Eventually it
works.

All pulled modules are sent back to the factory for reconditioning.  (Even
the ones that were ok go back - less chance of a human error, and they may
have been damaged by being pulled.)

The tech doesn\'t attempt to repair the broken module.  Too much time,
requires equipment sho doesn\'t have, parts she doesn\'t have, and probably
requires knowledge she doesn\'t have.  besides, it would void the warranty.


This is what I see starport repairs as like.  Thus, opening up the standard
module to repair/tweak it is a possibility, but the players will have to do
it themselves, or hunt for a good (and expensive) technician.


If you want more justification, keep in mind that the actual construction of
each standard module is protected by patents (and possibly black epoxy and
anti-tampering devices, depending on how paranoid the manufacturer is :-) ). 
An LSP avionics package meets the same specs as a General Products one, but
its interior circuitry will be different.  (Rather like chips nowadays: same
specs, different masks.)

Before we go off and cause problems for Imperial Games in our haste to
shoehorn FF&S into something that might use I make the following points.

1. Where does Greg Porter\'s equipment guide(which is to include personal
weapons) figure into this? From messages that he has posted, the tech will
have a "Mr Fusion" type power for personal equipment and weapons. Any of you
that have used his "Guns, Guns, Guns" and "More Guns" know that weapons
designed with G^3 are 180 degrees out of phase with FF&S. If we do not get
some input from Greg we may have a Starship design and personal
weapons/equipment that are not seamless in their design and effects. Ie
starships using FF&S for starship weapons/equipment and personal
equipment(Read vehicles)/weapons using what Greg Porters equipment guide
will use. 

2. Let fix the problems with FF&S before we shove it into Imperial Games
Starship creation system. If that means that it will not be ready by this
friday so be it.

        A. Homopolar Generators(Not in my starships!)
        B. Beam Pointers(Why, what is there use(s))

Check.

About the only thing I can think of in regard to FF&S fixes that are
critical at this stage of the game are:
1) The "laser limit" rule, which I feel should be added.
2) A decision needs to be made with respect to the maneuver technology
   used.  HEPlaR (and it\'s fuel usage) will require the current J-Drive
   fuel consumption.  A return to thruster plates should probably be 
   accompanied by a return to larger quantities of jump fuel.  This
   is a philosophical decision, and may need to be made by Marc.
3) Alternative (smaller) crew rules for civilian ships.

OK, this is something we can work with.  Basically, then, the single-digit
"factor" needs to combine chance to-hit, chance to penetrate, and damage
done.  I\'d suggest a system based on the expected value [*] of the damage
against a standardized target - perhaps something that delivers an expected
value of 1 major hit (nominal damage value of 40) should be USP 1.

The system can then scale exponentially (much like the original High Guard
system - a single laser was USP 1, but battery of 30 was USP 8).  As a
starting point, here\'s a suggestion:

USP = 1 + 2.1 * ln(Nweap * Deach / 40)
	where ln is the natural logarithm,
	      Nweap is the number of weapons in the battery,
	  and Deach is the damage value per weapon.
Increase the USP factor by one for batteries which have a Master Fire
Director dedicated to them.  Multipurpose MFDs can be  subsumed into the
computer/electronics USP.

For FF&S Lite users, a table could be provided listing USP factor and the
number of weapons required for a battery of the given factor (much like
High Guard, again).

[*] Note: this is a prob/stat term which means the number of the hits times
    the probability that they will occur.  For example, a system which does
    4 "hits" damage, but has a 50% "to-hit" roll and a 50% "penetrate" roll
    against our standardized target has an expected value of 1.

Well, you all know my feelings on that subject.

This might be a little _over_ simple, IMHO.  Perhaps a better idea might be
to make the USP an optional thing (much like it was in Classic Traveller;
USPs only came along with High Guard).  In the basic game, if you include
only lasers, missiles, and sandcaster turrets (again, much like Classic
Traveller) things become much simpler.  The USP can be presented along with
either the boardgame system or the detailed design system (or both).

Well, we\'ve already got a mechanic for this in FF&S, it just seems to me
that the values need changing slightly.  The (current) FF&S power plant
table looks like this.  I\'ve added a second column; this replaces the old
minimum volume and is the only change we need to make (the last column,
labelled "Std" is the same volume, expressed in displacement tons).

				Smallest Plant (in m3)
	TL Plant	MW/m3	FF&S		T4	(Std)
	 6 Fission	0.30	 30		  30	 2.1
	 7 Fission	0.60	 20		  20	 1.4
	 8 Fission	1.0	 10		  10	 0.7
	 9 Fusion	2.0	100		1000	71.4
	10 Fusion	2.0	 50		 500	35.7
	11 Fusion	2.0	 20		 100	 7.1
	12 Fusion	2.0	 10		  20	 1.4
	13 Fusion	3.0	  1		  10	 0.7
	14 Fusion	3.0	  0.25		   1
	15 Fusion	6.0	  0.1		   0.1
	16 Fusion	7.0	  0.075		   0.05

With the above table, you can see how fusion plants progress from large
installations (at TL-9, they would be ground based, or installed into
starships of several hundred displacement tons or more).  The TL-10 plant
isn\'t very useful for small ships, either (though you could try building a
75-ton craft around it), while at TL-11 things are looking marginally useful
for small craft above about 30 tons.

As I understand the Milleu 0, the Imperium will be at TL-11 to -12, while
most of it\'s competition will be at TL-9 or TL-10.  This is a significant
advantage for the Imperium, and also shows a distinct development curve
for power plants, as the gravitic and damper technology is mastered from
TL-11 through TL-13.

How\'s that for a starting point?

Sounds good ... though I think the system you\'ve got posted on your Web site
has a way to go before it is really this simple.

I know what you mean.  At the design\'s highest level I\'d like to just
plug parts together period. Virtually no math.

I know what you mean.  Maybe we should round everything off to the
NEXT highest ton for the simple system.  That would mean wasted space
in a ship design (as if *that* doesn\'t happen <g>), but it could be
explained as the misc overhead of fitting the pieces together.  At
higher design levels you could *optimize* designs and remove wasted
space.  It\'s a time/money/space tradeoff.

My vision of the simple system is more simple than David\'s FF&S Lite.
I\'d present complete systems to just plug together.  

I see 4 levels of complexity

Level 1:   Completely pre-generated Ships

Level 2:  Pre-generated systems you just plug together.

Start with a worksheet with eight short sections.

1.  Pick a hull from a list of the size, armor and config you want. 
The hull comes complete with integral grav control, and all the
piping, wiring, etc needed for everything else.  This also gives you
the available volume..no math required.

2.  Plug in the Jump drive and Jump Fuel volume from a list and
subtract vol from vol still available.  At worst you\'d have to
multiply the fuel needed for one jump by some small number.

3.  Plug in the Maneuver drive from a list and subtract vol from vol
still available.

4.  Pick a Bridge Package from a table and subtract it\'s vol from the
vol available.  The Packages would be very high level including
sensors, electronics, control, communications, security, computer, and
flight controls.

5.  Pick 0 to n weapon systems from tables and subtract from available
volume.

6.  Add accomidations from a table:  so many low berths, small cabins,
large cabins, commons etc. and subtract from vol.

7.  Pick an Engineering Package from a table and plug it in.

8.  Plug in a Power Package exceeding the total of power required by
the other 7 subsystems.

Level 3:  Pre-generated subsystems that you plug together to make
complete systems, ie. create a hull, create a custom Bridge from lists
of pre-gened sensors, computers, commo gear etc.  (This is FF&S Lite I
think.)

Level 4:  Create the subsystem parts themselves, ie. design a custom
sensor system from the physics.  (This is FF&S!)

If I were IG, <g> I\'d put Level 1 and 2 in the basic rules. I\'d
include Level 3 with lots of ships, and ship systems in _Starships_,
and put Level 4 in an updated FF&S...which I\'d rename something like
TRAVELLER TECHNICAL DESIGN MANUAL.

Space.  You can print a 40+ character UPx on a single line of a
magazine or manual.  I\'m sure that\'s why they are so insistant on
continuing with the UPx\'s.  

Don\'t get me wrong, though, I\'d *like* to have the info in a form more
useful than the UPx format.  Can you come up with one?

Just a few comments:

1)  I think (hope) FF&S Light will be like your system, making it three 
levels.  David?

2)  Yes, IG, /please/ include a very basic, very high level design system 
in the basic rules (if FF&S Light fits that bill, include it; if not, use 
a system such as Eris just outlined).  

3)  Also, please DO rename Fire, Fusion, and Steel to something a little 
less....pop cultureish.  Technical Design Manual would be fine.  Starship 
Engineer\'s Handbook would work, too.  Something like that.

Quite contrary, my dear watson!
In fact starports are NOT local affairs. They are even more than 
airports today, considered to be territory not belonging to the 
planet (country), but to the Imperium. The town which lies next to 
the port however is planetary territory. So the weapons restrictions 
of the planet do not apply to the starport (though it may have it\'s 
own, and once on the starport, the local police can\'t directly get to 
you (although you might be extradited).

This is how i always understood the status of starports! Correct me 
if i\'m wrong!

The one thing I *wouldn\'t* like to see is TNE messages.  I\'ll admit up 
front to a strong personal bias against TNE (for a variety of reasons), 
but I really feel that TNE material is likely to have less 
cross-relevance than material for any of the other variants.  Not only is 
there a different game system, the basis of the technology has changed, 
and there is a very different feel.

If people want to play TNE, that\'s their business, and I hope that they 
aren\'t left unsupported the way I was, because that sucked.  But:

I have no interest in TNE, and no desire to see anything about it.  I\'d 
have to say that I would not be a member of any mailing list that included 
TNE stuff, and I doubt I am alone.

My point being is why should Greg fix something that he did not have any

Actually, the problem comes during play not from designing ships on the
fly, but: 

  REF> Ok, the pirate corsair just took out your Jump Drives, you limp
       back to the space port.

  Player> How much is this going to cost me?

  REF(CT book2)> [flips to the chart] Hmm, J-2, thats 20Mcr to replace.
  REF(CT book5)> [flips to the chart] Hmm, thats 4.0 * 3% of 200.  Give 
                 me a sec...  [plays with a calulator for 10 seconds] Thats
                 24Mcr.
  REF(TNE)>      [flips to the chart, doesnt find one], Ummm, I dunno.
  REF(FF&S)>     [flips to the chart, gets tied up reading text] Oh here it
                 is.  Your J-2 drive uses 3% of your 200 T ship  But I have
                 to get tons in to Cubic Meters first.  Lets see thats 2800 m3
                 so 2800 * 0.03 Cubic Meters (goes to the calculator).  Ok we
                 need 84 m3 of drive space * 0.3 MCr, well that 25.2 MCR.
  REF(MT)>       [Flips to the chart] Hmm, J2, 200T, thats 6 jump units
                 at 3Mcr each. 18Mcr.

[Real times for me to actually resolve this problem]
CT Book 2:   10 seconds (ok so I used the Traveller Book, not CT book 2)
CT Book 5:   30 seconds
MT:          20 seconds
TNE:         N/A
TNE/FF&S:    3 minutes (looking like a fool to the players)

So hopefully this is will show you my complaint with FF&S.  Which at least
FF&S has 1Ton = 14 Cubic Meters, where MT had 1 Ton = 13.5 Kiloliters.

CT Book 2 was easy to ref and do on the fly ship changes, but thats not
all of it.  I build ships away from the game, but when it takes a long time
to build a ship as it does with FF&S.  Even HG takes a fair amount of time.
MT and CT systems allowed ships to be created quickly, so I can spend the
few hours a week I have to prepare my sessions on things like NPC\'s and
"Dungeon Dressing" so to speak.  I could care less how may cubic meters
of space the computer takes up, but rather let the players know that it
has a voice interface and 3D holo-projection video display.

FF&S Light may have some potential.  Hopefully Don will consider the 
"Gaming" aspect of ship creation.  Its easy to get lost in the system
and work on getting ships designed in a cohesive fashion, but if the out
come doesn\'t make the core game, the role playing game, any better, then
it doesn\'t benifit the gamer.

I don\'t know what you mean by compact.  Yes it shouldn\'t take the
whole page to give a ships stats, but they don\'t need to be
forced into a 1/2 line of text either.  Taking a few extra
lines to present them in a readable format (that doesn\'t require
refering to some table, possbily in another book, and counting
character positions) is not going to hard to do.

Even for shorted universal profiles (like for charactes) I don\'t
see any reason for gobbly-gook.  Shorters ones are easier to
read, but the alternative of a more readable format is also easier.

If Imperial games wants to give a universal profile at the top
for diehards, I have no reason to object, but I recomments that
they don\'t rely on universal profiles to present info.

I see your point, but I usually had the full notes on player ships handy
for such stuff.  If I didn\'t, I\'d take the time needed----it takes my car
mechanic all day to cost out something----or at least 3minutes for a real
guess (then I get the real phone call later and feint:-).

Even before T4 we were working on FFS Light for just that reason.

Suplement 9 is readable----1 8.5x5.5inch page per ship with picture, so 2
ships per blackbook page.  That\'s 4 per page in the new format (they say
8.5x11).  Maybe they could squeeze in 5.  USPs seem to average about
9-10 per page in blackbooks, so that\'d be 18-20 in the new format (even
with 4 trailing spots for sensor stuff).

The Starship book and the Small Craft book will have expanded info as
well as deck plans from what Don said.  Keeping USPs just makes the
option of packing in less developed designs into a smaller space
easier.  Or if they gave a page per JTAS to a new ship, would you rather
see expanded technical info, or historical notes about the names,
battles, mysteries of the new class?  I\'d rather get a USP and a ton of
non-technical info, myself.

No!  Thank you for listening and at least giving us a chance to help.  I

I not only never liked \'em, I never used \'em :-)  I always thought of
them as blowtorches.

According to Dave Golden, T4 will have thrusterplates, but we are
working on drop-in reaction drives as well.  Even if T-plates are gonna
be the canon for the Imperium, having a couple other types will add
flavor.  We\'ll have to provide the info, and see what Don does with it.

        Would you use Discharge Energy, or try to do it using the actual
penetration/damage values? That gives us a direct tie between the armor and
the weapon ratings. However we scale the weapons, we have to make sure they
still get through the same armor. Maybe some kind of logarithmic scale:

        Pen/Armor       USP
           0-1           0
           2-4           1
           5-12          2
           13-33         3
           34-90         4
           90-244        5
           245-665       6
              etc.

        Obviously I\'m using natural logs here, but this is just an example.
How does BR scale BL weapons & armor? I need to dig up the rules and check.

        I believe Don wants to add some sensor info to the USP, which is why
he\'s reluctant to go even further than that -- he thinks it\'s already
bloated. I wanted to break out a variable number of digits for each weapon
type, since HG assumed all lasers were identical and that\'s not true. You
also can\'t have particle bays if you\'ve got a particle spinal, for example.
I saw it something like this

        xxxxxxx-842-xxxxxxxx
                26A

meaning 2 weapons (say, lasers) of factor 8, 6 more lasers of factor 4, and
10 of factor 2.

        Sounds reasonable. Now we just need to figure out the specific
factors. I\'ll give a swing at it tomorrow. The basic idea is that a
"reasonable" small craft reactor is too big for the small craft.

        As I recall, MMT will have the combat rules and some predesigned

Finally, FF&S 2 will follow.

        Don was pretty clear about not wanting to change FF&S -- I had to
convince him that a few tweaks would be worth the effort. Do we really want
to try to swing something this major while trying to get the whole thing
done by Friday?

        I think our best bet is to concentrate on first getting FF&S Light
rules written to convince him it\'s workable, and when we turn them in try to
convince him we need to go back and fix FF&S. At that point, since most of
the work on USP conversion and etc. will have been done, updates to FF&S
shouldn\'t be too difficult to flow into FF&S Light -- just a matter of
changing tables.

        We really need to knock the rules out quick.

        Already being addressed, although specifics are still in flux (i.e.
formless). Basically, I\'d like to assume that the FF&S crew rules are for
post-Virus paranoid minimally-automated ships. The basic crew factor for
each system will be its straight FF&S crew requirement, and then we\'ll
multiply by a fraction (dependent on TL?) to come up with crews for more
automated systems

        Hmm ... sounds like a start. I was thinking of using the same
scaling for weapons and armor factors ... after the conversion a weapon
should still be as effective against the same converted armor.

All of the hulls were built with (I hope) standard FF&S rules.  Included
in every hull is also Basic and Extended life support, one airlock per
100 displacement tons (up to a maximum of ten), one large cargo hatch per
200 displacement tons (up to a maximum of four), and a few small cargo
hatches.  The hulls also have artificial gravity and g-compensation
installed, and are built at TL-10.  Note that (as long as TL-10 materials
are used), the capacity of the G-compensation system increases with TL, but
the hull statistics remain otherwise the same.

Oh ... a word of explanation is in order about the hull configuration
USP codes.  They\'re basically the same configurations that are possible
with FF&S, except that I gave them each a USP code letter.  The codes
are arranged as follows (with no attempt at being compatible with any
other edition of Traveller and it\'s USP configuration codes).

USP	Form
0	Open Frame
1	Needle
2	Needle Streamlined
3	Needle Airframe
4	Wedge
5	Wedge Streamlined
6	Wedge Airframe
7	Cylinder
8	Cylinder Streamlined
9	Cylinder Airframe
A	Box
B	Box Streamlined
C	Sphere
D	Sphere Streamlined
E	Disk
F	Disk Streamlined
G	Disk Airframe
H	Close Structure
J	Slab
K	Slab Streamlined
L	Slab Airframe

That\'s enough for tonight; I\'ve got to go to work tomorrow, and it\'s late.
Hopefully soon, I\'ll be able to do some more systems.

        I don\'t know that thrusterplates will be canon, just that they\'ll be
included. That\'s one of the things on which I\'m seeking clarification from Don.

        Convinced me. From here on out, I\'ll try to address FF&S Light
questions & comments straight to the GDW-Beta list, although for the next
day or so, as stuff trickles in, I\'ll make sure I reply to the source list
as well. That way, people who don\'t care won\'t be bombarded with all this
stuff, and those who do won\'t have to look at it three times ...

I know that a lot of die hards have gotten emotionally attached
to the method but I it\'s a barrier to new players.  If you are
interested in selling it to more than just players who have used
the game so long that they have memorized all the profiles formats
and can read them off without even counting columns, then I
suggest Imperial Games drop them.  For anyone who hasn\'t invested
a lot of time in learning and using Traveller, they are a bad
idea.

A ships stats could easily be presented in a short paragraph while
greatly increasing readability.  Other info would
be even shorter.  If you look at the space devoted to present
stats, it is never very much (descriptions take up most of the
space in any game).  Unless you have spent years using them,
universal profiles are very diffucult to use.

There is a reason nobody else has ever adopted this approach.  It
makes things a lot harder to read and results in limited savings
in space.

>Don\'t get me wrong, though, I\'d *like* to have the info in a form more
>useful than the UPx format.  Can you come up with one?

The a scores of games out there that present similar info and
don\'t have to use such tatics.  One simple change is to put
short abbreviations in front of numbers to indicate what
they are (heck you could even leave groups of numbers that
represent the same thing as a "bunch").

They work well for people that have trained themselves to use
them quickly.  But most gamers don\'t want to have to invest that
kind of time just to use one game.  If you want to appeal to
more than hard core Traveller players, I would recommend against
them.  (You could stick them at the top, in addition to other info,
but don\'t make the primary way of presenting info.)

With consistent formating and a set of well defined abbreviations the
same info could be presented in just a few more lines.  We aren\'t talking
about loosing a "ton" on non-technical info.  The savings in space
just aren\'t _that_ dramatic.

I guess, in the end, Imperial Games is going to have to decide if they
want give things in a way that is a bit better for long time players
while risking turning off new players who might be interested in the
game.

Note: even if you don\'t use thruster plates doesn\'t mean you have
to have reaction drives.  There is no reason a reactionless thruster
couldn\'t push in one direction and happen to throw exhast out, as
a by product, in the same direction it\'s thrusting in.

Yeah, but I don\'t use reaction drives OR thruster plates! :->

Non-Imperium cultures may well be using reaction drives.

I just about had a cow when I found out that the TNE rules didn\'t have

Your J-2 drive uses 3% of your 200 T ship But I have to get tons in to
Cubic Meters first.  Lets see thats 2800 m3 so 2800 * 0.03 Cubic
Meters (goes to the calculator).  Ok we need 84 m3 of drive space *
0.3 MCr, well that 25.2 MCR.

Sad, but true!

>REF(MT)
>[Flips to the chart] Hmm, J2, 200T, thats 6 jump units at 3Mcr

..but is that the right answer. With MT I was never sure.

Tell you how I handle that, how I handled it from CT on up in fact.  I
mentioned earlier that I transfer data from UP\'s to my own forms.  On
my form the price of the Jump Drive would be sitting right there on
the form!  And right next to it is the MW\'s (or Power Points or
whatever) it puts out.  And next to that is a entry for it\'s current
condition.

"How much is this gonna cost me?"

I look at my form..."About 20MC, if the yard has one of the right size
on hand.  You might want to have Jill (the Engineer) check it out and
see if it\'s either repairable or at least
salvageable." 

Time?  3 seconds and *no* effect on game flow.

A ship\'s USP has always been raw data to me..not all that useful until
I expand it and put it into a better format.  I don\'t propose ditching
the USP, they\'re nice and compact, but I don\'t suggest anybody use
them raw...cook \'em first.  <G>

>So hopefully this is will show you my complaint with FF&S.  Which at

>Kiloliters.

I use 14 for rough approximations, but 13.5 is really closer to
correct.  One ton is 2 squares.  Each square is 1.5x1.5x3..and for we
parochial Americans that\'s 5feetx5feetx10feet per square. It was
always neat, clean and easy..that\'s one reason I like Traveller the
scale was right.

WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!

Don announced in a recent message that deck plans will be based on 2m
squares.  That\'s actually a pretty big change from the past.

Nobody has complained, but I\'m going to HATE Don changing from a 1.5m
square to 2m.  Two meters might be a terrible scale to convert to
tons.  Let\'s think about it!

The best way probably will be 1 square = 1 ton.  Do it like this: each
square is 2m x 2m x 3.5m = 14, and 14 is the TNE (and FF&S) ton. 
Oooh!  Maybe it\'ll work....it means no easy 1/2 ton spaces on the deck
plans though. ;-<

The only problems with the change will rationalizing 3.5m head spaces
(I guess we could go with 2.5m ceilings and a 1 meter crawl space
above that for piping, wiring, grav plates, etc.), and converting all
the old designs that had 1.5m squares to the new scale.

This sounds OK, but I am wondering if this meas that T4 is abandoning
Thruster plates and using those annoying HEPLaR drive.  I sincerely hope
this is not so.  HEPLaR was one of the major things (after the Virus and
the mechanics) which made me truly dislike TNE.  Traveller just doesn\'t
feel like Traveller w/o Thruster plates.

I suggest the following things:

2. Include more information on construction of one\'s own universe rather
than forcing players to use the Imperium. 

3. In the world generation system, include some ways to determine whether

enuf for jump drives without necessitating the influence of the Imperium or
some other outside government. 

4. The old trade system required more dice rolling than roll playing, please
update this with role playing involved.

I think that Traveller over the net is as viable as any game.
I have been with a few upstart play by mails that ran for a couple
of weeks and then died off.  The Play By Mail is a bit difficult
as interaction is limited.  Using IRC or some other forum is more
likely to work.  At MPG-Net, we have had two ongoing AD&D games that
take place in our chat rooms.  Its $2 an hour to play that way.  IRC
is too unstable to be reliable.  I am working on an online Traveller
campaign.  As soon as I get some clearance on some usage things, I 
plan to post it and open it up for play.

I use the web for distributing maps, library data, and such, and use
MPG-Nets online facilities to actually play.  I will announce that here
when I am ready.

How about this for a suggestion.

How about a blank form that would allow you to plug the string of 
numbers into it.  say down a left hand column...
Then you could use the rest of that row to explain what the 
particular digit meant.

I can\'t find the original post on this one, so I\'ll respond here.

This would be a bad idea as a sole option.  Let\'s face it, all things 
being equal, a little 200 ton tramp freighter (Free Trader), should 
probably be close to a 1 man ship by TL 15...

I actually liked the MT model the best.  You can automate as much or 
little of the crew functions as possible.  Essentially, except at the 
lowest tech levels, you can use the computer to do a lot of work that 
crew members would ordinarily do, but at a cost.  Or if you want to 
hold down the construction cost, put in less automation, and hire 
more crewmembers.  Let\'s face it.  Office and factory automation is 
already removing/has already removed the need for a lot of jobs that 
used to be done by people, and this is at TL8.

Hell, by TL15, ships of several hundred tons could conceivably be 1 man 
vehicles.   Of course, heaven help the 1 man if they don\'t know how to 
maintain the drives, guns, screens, computer, etc...which is the real 
reason for the need for additional crew members...

Now _this_ is the way to make a basic design system out of a complicated
one!  I did exactly this with the MT craft design rules for my players: 
pre-designed packages of components so you could just pick options off a
menu to build a ship.  It worked great for civilian and OK for
para-military ships.

I appreciate they can be hard to read - I still struggle with
the High Guard ones - they are a tremendous way to present a
lot of information concisely.

I\'m not suggesting that they should always be used alone,
although when you have a sector\'s planet\'s stats to print out
or publish they\'re ideal.

I have to confess to one of my first fascinations with
Traveller being the way you could summarize a world in just 8

I would like to know if Don Perrin and Greg Porter have discussed issues
concerning the use of FF&S Lite in the design of starships for MMT. If Greg
does not know what Don is planning and vice versa, then we will have a two
different systems one for starships and another for vehicles/personal
weapons. What that will mean to the referee and players is this:

Player: I firing my Gavit Fairfax 50, on full burn at the hatch to breech
the lock.

Referee: Hmm taking the "fifties" DV converting to Dam/pen, throwing salt
over left shoulder, running the Pentium 166 to factor in variables, looking
up four different tables in two different books and seven pages, takes four
asprin, swallows with a pint of bitter, finally decides on flipping a coin,
"heads it breeches, tails the gun blows up".

I for one WILL not buy a game system that one has to go thru anything like
the above. I have not seen any input from Greg Porter concerning starship
design using FF&S Lite. Despite what some people think the starship and
vehicle/personal weapons systems have to in sync. I also do not believe in
"Let Greg Fix that issue/problem that FF&S has" attitude in order to get
FF&S lite into the Don\'s deadline. 

I want a QUALITY product if it is late so be it. If it is going to a half
baked, mu-quark nightmare, fix it later product, I will not be a buyer.

IMHO FF&S and FF&S Lite have too many issues/problems that HAVE to
addressed/deal with before either can be considered into the MMT/T4 design
sequence. I do not believe that the issues/problems can be adequately
resolved before the Don deadline. People have stated that the crew size has
been resolved, but no one has posted it to the list lately for the rest of
the list(s). The starship design system and the vehicles/personal weapons
design system HAVE to be as seamless as possible.

Does anyone have Greg Porter\'s email address, and would you post it. I will
ensure that the last week\'s messages concerning FF&S lite starship design
will get to him.

I don\'t know if that\'s true, but I heartily agree with the sentiment.
The "advanced" military character generation schemes of CT were one
of its greatest flaws (e.g., almost every convention game I\'d ever
seen involved a military mission--when I ran a non-military one at a
convention, a dozen new players decided to switch to Traveller).

Unfortunately, there are a number of competing interests in even the
existing Traveller players:

A. "generic" SF gaming
B. having a background with a great deal of history
C. prepackaged adventures/hooks/etc.
D. designing stuff (ships/planets/weapons/etc.) in detail
E. designing stuff quickly
F. detailed lists of equipment/ships/planets to choose from
G. solo gaming activities--see (D) & (E)
H. role-playing
I. roll-playing (i.e., wargaming)

(A), (H), and to some extent (I) need to be addressed by a core set
of minimalist rules including a simple task system. (B), (C), and (F)
realistically require some level of compatibility with CT and a very
careful look at any required changes in canon. (D) must be addressed
very early to guarantee compatilibity with (B), (E) and (F). If you
have (E) in the core rules, (D) probably needs to be available (and
tested out) first. Preferably, everything possible in (F) should be
designed with (D) as well.

What I\'m getting to is this:

o It is important that the design rules be made available as soon as
  possible and tested out. It sounds like the folks at IG already
  know this and are deciding on FF&S (hopefully under a better name).
  I\'ve never seen FF&S so can\'t comment on it, but you\'d better
  avoid the typos/flaws of MT or it\'s dead to begin with. Hopefully
  (E) doesn\'t need to be sacrificed either.

o You need to understand what is canon and what is diametrically
  opposed to it. Canon really only matters on a campaign scale. It
  doesn\'t really matter whether SOM says something works a certain
  way if that upsets the balance of the universe.

o Backward compatibility is a must, although equally important is
  knowing where not to be compatible (e.g., should a converted CT
  marine completely outclass a CT scientist or barbarian?). Some
  knowledge of how to convert old designs (e.g., assume scientists
  or Book 2 ships have certain other skills/equipment) is likely
  sufficient.

Regarding canon: Both HEPlaR and thruster plates are non-canonical
in my book, since both give players (and anyone who can get hold of
even a small spaceship) access to planet-killers. What needs to be
prevented is the amount of ENERGY available/needed in the ships\'
propulsion systems. Serious acceleration should only be possible
when some sort of device is present that limits your total kinetic
energy. Fusion "torch-ships" should be "welcomed" by SDBs at a
healthy distance from the main planet (they\'re easy to detect, and
modern "zeta-field" ships run circles around them anyway :-).

Regarding backward compatibility: One of the strengths of CT was
the grand scale of things. Tons of plot hooks (e.g., 76 Patrons)
and historical happenings could be developed without interfering
with each other. A referee could fully develop a half dozen worlds
in a subsector without worrying about the universe being pulled
out from under it. This feel was difficult to maintain in MT, and
I presume lost almost completely in TNE.

Regarding packaging: "Just say no" to flashy colorful covers. At
least put the art on a removable cover for the hard-bound book.
Of course, you can\'t beat those little black books :-).

I didn\'t mean to address so much at once, but while I\'m at it,
I might as well discuss gaining new players. One way to do this
is to package the core traveller rules (probably without (E)) as
a supplement that could be added as a few pages to the back of
science fiction books. Add another page for the main characters\'
UPPs and one for campaign notes and you\'re set! If you can\'t get
the "T4 Core" into a particular author\'s books, consider getting
into equipment and world guides (you know, the books that only
true SF fanatics/completists buy)--these would include both the
core rules and some design rules (likely not FF&S) provided for
"demonstrative" value as well as playability.

Just some ramblings from a long-time lurker who was mysteriously
resurrected to the list recently...

design rules (and hopefully forestall any more emails arguing me into a 
position I have already taken! :), I want to say once again that I fully 
support the vision that David Golden has articulated.

I think his idea of a high-level design system based on the low-level 
FF&S system is a good one, given that the high-level system will be 
comprised mostly of menu-like tables from which the user can pick and 
choose options and put them together without much beyond some addition, 
subtraction, and a bit of multiplication.  I think the completeness of 
this system will be welcomed by new players (which was my primary concern 
in the determination of which system to use).  

BTW, I believe the whole confusion over where I stand is my own fault.  
In the last public exchange I had with David, I allowed my thought 
processes to show through.  That is, the first few quote/reply sections in 
the message were dissenting, while the end of the message had quote/reply 
sections that were in agreement.  I was trying to show /why/ I had 
changed my mind, since I had initially been opposed to the FF&S Light 
system.  I didn\'t want to look like I was just jumping on the bandwagon, 
because that was not the case.  At any rate, I am very sorry for the 
confusion, and I hope this message clears it up.  I want to get beyond 
the argument and into the development stage! :-)

This is an exciting time to be a Traveller enthusiast, and I\'m glad to be 
among so many people who not only share my interest, but who have a lot 
of knowledge and ideas that are being put to use so we can all have the 
best Traveller yet.

While I don\'t have any answers yet from the powers that be, I 
did get permission to:

   a) start a mailing list for the products.

   b) Open the FTP archive for fan generated items.

So here is the juice on them:

    MPG-Net, on behalf of Tantalus Inc.  has created three new mailing 
lists for fans to discuss Dark Conspiracy, Twilight 2000, and 2300AD.  
The lists are:

    2300ad@mpgn.com / 2300ad-digest@mpgn.com
    twilight2000@mpgn.com / twilight2000-digest@mpgn.com
    darkconspiracy@mpgn.com / darkconspiracy-digest@mpgn.com

To subscribe to one of these lists, send mail to:

    majordomo@mpgn.com

and in the body say:

   subscribe listname email address

example:

   subscribe twilight2000-digest bubba@bubba.org


Regarding uploads:

   Tantalus Inc. doesn\'t mind any fan created materials for Dark Conspiracy, 
Twilight 2000, or 2300AD. You may do so as long as it meets the following
critera:

1. It has to contain a disclaimer.  See ftp://ftp.mpgn.com/DISCLAIMER.TANTALUS
   For text documents, the disclaimer needs to appear at the top of the 
   document.  For programs, it needs to appear on any title/splash screen or
   About box.

2. Tantalus Inc. would like you to upload it to ftp.mpgn.com in the /incoming 
   directory. Then send mail to ftp-maint@mpgn.com that you have uploaded it 
   and its for one of the systems listed here (which this isn\'t bad advice for 
   any upload) and upload a .submission file.  A template for the .submission file 
   can be downloaded from ftp://ftp.mpgn.com/incoming/template.sub.  After its 
   reviewed to make sure its cool (i.e. you haven\'t scanned in the books, its not 
   offensive etc.), MPG-Net will put it out for public access.

3. If you have a web page for your product, or gaming, or other appropriate
   content, please include a link to our site http://www.mpgn.com.

     Um, "blowtorches?"  I don\'t understand--thruster plates are a
reactionless drive.  They don\'t throw anything out the back--no exhaust,
no mess, no noise, no bother.  That\'s why I like them so much (once
they\'ve been suitably tweaked).

Because I treated CT drives as reaction drives, as I said, I never used

        Sorry to disappoint you, but ... FF&S (suitably renamed) is going to
be the detailed design sequence for MMT, and I\'ve been told to avoid making
changes as I create FF&S Light. Thruster plates *will* continue to be
available as "alternate" technology. Reaction drives such as HEPlaR are the
primary focus, though.

of weapons, from handguns to battleship spinal mounts, use the same basic
system. Don agrees, and he says the coordination will happen. Worst comes to

a day, and replaced BEFORE it gets printed.

        Sorry, I thought I\'d explained my thinking. The "Crew Factor" listed
in my tables is the FF&S crew the system needs. FF&S, being written for TNE
with Virus, assumes automation is very low and unintelligent. A simple
fractional multiplier would then be used to reduce that crew factor down for
more automated ships. This tweak doesn\'t invalidate FF&S, it just expands on it.

        As a reminder: To ease the load on the normal lists, and avoid
dumping on those who aren\'t that interested, the discussion is moving to the
GDW-Beta list. The logic behind this is:

        1) This is more or less the function of the Beta List anyway. IIRC,
it was originally started as a volunteer effort to critique the design rules
for TNE.

        2) The GDW-Beta list is archived realtime to the WWW at
           http://www.qrc.com/~wildstar/gdw-beta/

        3) Echoing everything to three different lists means everybody who\'s
on more than one has to wade through three copies of everything.

The posting address is:

If you want to subscribe to the list, send e-mail to:

	gdw-beta-request@qrc.com

You can post to the list without being subscribed. So if you don\'t want to
get all the mail, but occasionally browse the archive and want to comment
you can.

That\'s what I already do.  I made up a form for Worlds, a form for
characters, and a form for ships with the description of the UP down
the left a blank for the number and the rest of the line for more info
and descriptive comments.  Below the official UP lines I add my own,
and use the rest to the page for other data. Everytime something
changes I have to change the forms..they\'re out of date at the moment,
and have some stuff that isn\'t standard Traveller.  

Would you like me to post samples here?

Me!  I haven\'t GMed or been a player in a face-to-face game in almost
2 years.  <sigh> Anybody around Pensacola FL want to get a game going?
I\'d *love* to play some live!  

>Also, has anyone given serious thought to whether any parts of
Traveller can be played out over the \'Net?

I have!  And I have!  <g> I ran a Traveller (non-Imperium) game on
VNET for about a year.  The players gave me TNE stats and skills (I
modified them somewhat), and we exchanged moves.  I did all the
rolling and I didn\'t use Traveller specific terms in my messages, like
UWP\'s or USP\'s, because most of them didn\'t have any Traveller
materials.  To the players the game rules were pretty much invisible,
but the feel was classic CT!

I\'m gonna do another one on Fido (SF&ANIME_RPG) starting this summer. 
I need to finish several projects before I have time to start, but
late June, early July looks like a launch date.

If and when my email game DART (Star Trek universe/TNE mechanics)
winds down, I\'ll start a T4 game.  Heck, after T4 comes out I might
put DART on hiatus and run a pure Traveller anyway! <G>

It certainly is!

There are several problems:

1.  Mail-lag times.  You might send in a post to the GM and get
nothing back for a week or two.  Players have to be really patient for
it to work.  I currently GM or play in 8 games via email or echomail,
so it can be done.  

I encourage open posting in the games I GM..everybody gets everybody
elses messages (although really secret stuff stays private), and chats
with each other.  The PC\'s can\'t *act* on anything their character
wouldn\'t actually know, but they can read most of what\'s going on.  So
even when they don\'t get a move for a week..or two..they still can
stay involved while waiting.

2.  Lost mail/bad connections.  We all know it happens, so we have to
be ready and willing to repost and forward for other players.

3.  Distributing maps, pictures..anything graphical.

4.  People losing access.  Boards go down.  People move,
graduate, change jobs.

But it *can* be done and it\'s as much fun as live gameing..in a
different way.  I don\'t think either way replaces the other.

>Using IRC or some other forum is more likely to work.  

Yes, IRC does work and gives more of a *live* feel.  I\'ve played that
way a couple of times.  Personally, I don\'t like it as well as
email..or live.

>I use the web for distributing maps, library data, and such, and use

That\'s something I want to do for my email games eventually.  I also
send mime or uuencoded stuff with maps and graphics.  I even went out
and bought a scanner *primarily* for my email stuff. <g>

        Actually, I was planning on neither ... what I\'m thinking of as
automation isn\'t mechanical stuff that fixes things, etc. It\'s software that
enhances the ability of the user, and hence doesn\'t really add space.

Example: Now, instead of having a guy sitting in front of a radar screen, a
guy sitting in front of an infrared scanner, a third guy monitoring the
optical telescope -- you pipe a processed, enhanced and interpreted image
combining all three to one guy (sensor fusion).

Or, instead of having a dozen people monitoring dumb readouts in engineering
to baby the power plant, you\'ve got one guy with his feet up on the
terminal, watching the computer watch the system

Why am I thinking along these lines? It\'s much simpler and quicker to
implement than coming up with new rules for controls, etc, and it extends
FF&S without changing any of the existing FF&S rules. In the same manner you
can say Einsteinian physics didn\'t change Newtonian -- it merely addressed
an area not covered by Newtonian.

Not that I\'m opposed to new rules -- we\'re in a time crunch here. If
somebody can pull up the HAIS rules (I\'ve lost them), and integrate them
into the existing FF&S rules, I\'ll slap them in and go to bat for them. But
they\'ve got to be something we can pull back out, just like we can take the
crew multipliers back out, if we have to.


<BRAINFLASH>
        Duh... if I\'m talking about multiplying the crew numbers as an
"extension" to the rules, we can also multiply the basic control system
numbers by a factor ... say, for example, at TL12, each 10% increase in size
in the basic control system gives you a 5% reduction in crew requirements.

        Anybody wanna take this & run with it?

You really think so?  Hmmm.  I saw the flaw being that there weren\'t more 
non-military advanced characters available from GDW.  I did an advanced 
generation system for Pirates and Belters, and I think GDW should have 
done so as well - plus advanced systems for other Citizens character 
types, a scientist, and a lot of other things.  

I\'m hoping this will be corrected in T4, since they plan on having 10 
basic character types.  Keep the military stuff, but make that only 30% 
or so of the character types available.

Wow.  Good summary!  I love the diversity of activities associated with 
Traveller, and I hope this is continued in the new system.

Thankfully, the word is that all of these things will be done.  Marc has 
said the production values will be very high, David Golden has said FF\'S 
will be renamed, and FF&S Light is taking shape live, on a web-site!  
Whoo-hoo! :)

I can\'t comment on TNE, but in my conversations with Ken Whitman, I was 
told that each referee will be designing his own worlds outside of a 
small, core area of "known space."  You\'ll know where the worlds are, but 
you won\'t know what they\'re like.  It will be up to you to determine what 
each world is like (and, undoubtedly, various published Adventures will 
offer predesigned worlds if the referee doesn\'t want to design his/her 
own).

     Um, okay...  Why?  I mean, thruster plates are massively superior

As for redesign try this
Lasers
(delivered energy in joules X .735/Beam Diameter in mm)^.5=A Guns Guns Guns
Damage Value

2.5(sqrt(DE(1/r^2)\\) to arrive at FF&S Damage value.

I for one would not care to convert one design to another even with
extensive spreadsheet experience much less in less than a day.

Give your system a benchmark then
a 100 ton needle/AF with 2 jump and 2G manueover and a crew of one!!

Penetration scale:
Dagger - 1
Light/medium pistol, sword, bow - 2 (current 9mm pistol)
heavy pistol, heavy melee weapon, crossbow  - 3 (current .44)
Carbine (generic bullpup) or seriously heavy pistol - 4 (M-16)
ACR - 5 to 6

Hmm let test this out with a example

The Starship "Go For it" has landed at the starport "Ty Me Down". After
having a dispute with planetary authorities the ship attempts to lift off
without permission.

The locals bring out the "Dorkbruiser" Superheavy Assault Tank mounting a
555 Mw Gatling Partical Beam weapon. The "Dorkbruiser" is armored with 100mm
of Hemostatic Crystallized Feldercarb. The Bruiser has Mu-Quark Nightmare
Integrated Sensor Fire Control System with optional beer cooler.

Meanwhile the "Go For It" unlimbers it\'s 300 Mj Laser Barbette with a it\'s
own MFD and beam pointer!!! The ship has a Armor Value of 100 in Superdense
Armor.

Gee now the Bruiser\'s weapon has pen/damage of 45/67 versus 1cm of
Feldercarb armor, the 300 Mj Laser Barbette has pen of...

Well you could see a worst case situation.

Um, because I thought reactionless drives were silly (in a nutshell) :-)

Actually, CT drives *were* fusion rockets.  1st edition HG had rules for
using drive exhaust as a fusion gun, didn\'t it?  That\'s what we did,
actually.  Like Niven stuff.

I thought that trying to make sense of the canon starports with blast
berms around the landing pads, and explanations for why *all* ships have
clear exhaust chambers at the rear made no sense (I thought of it as a
*shudder* MT invention :-)

You experience is far from typical.  Most people can\'t memorize what
each of 30 some odd digits means in 20 min without even trying.  I
glad it works so well for you, but the fact is that their use
is going to be a barrier to new players.

Tom, Stu\'s response misrepresents history, or at least doesn\'t provide much
information. Game Designers\' Workshop first released Traveller in 1977.  It
was supported by a quarterly magazine called the Journal of the Traveller\'s
Aid Society ("JTAS"). That was later supplanted by Challenge.  JTAS and
Challenge contained many articles setting out the future history of the
Traveller Universe.  

GDW (and licensees, notably Digest Group Publications) also produced many
supplements and adventures that incorporated and explicated the future
history.  Some important works to note are Library Data (2 volumes), the
Imperial Encyclopedia, the GDW alien modules (Aslan, Vargr, Kkree, Zhodani,
Droyne, Solomani), the DGP alien modules (Vilani & Vargr; Solomani & Aslan).  

Aficionados refer to the body of GDW-produced and -approved work as the
"canon".  Learn the canon.  Study the canon.

        Unfortunately, there\'s not much that I can do about it. All I\'m
going to do is plug the standard FF&S weapons into the tables, and assume
that if they\'ve changed somebody at Imperium Games has the new stats. If
nobody does, then obviously they can\'t have been changed.

    'body' => 'Ok, here are some thoughts on possibilities:

Traveller fusion plants seem to use some sort of magnetic confinement
(as opposed to inertial confinement). And as researchers have learned
the hard way, there are *definite* scaling problems with the magnetic
fields. For a given type of magnetic field setup there is actually a
minimum size at which you can make a reactor work! If you try building
one smaller than that, you get losses of plasma that prevent operation,
long before you get to the fusion temperature and pressure ranges. 

So you add subsidiary magnetic fields, to help "stabilize" the plasma.
But the new configuration has its own scaling problems. 

So all that is really needed is for the Vilani to have made a
breakthrough in finding a new field configuration that has acceptable
leakage rates and acceptable stability at less than 100 ton sizes.

For what it is worth, reseaerchers did some calcs *years* back on the
minimum size required for a workable "magnetic mirror" (ie long
cylindrical magnetic field, like you\'d get from a *huge* solenoid type
coil) and simple torus (field bent into a "donut" shape). As I recall a
magnetic mirror reactor would work just fine if you were willing to
make it 10 *miles* long. And a toroidal reactor would work fine at 8
miles in diameter. (If we wanted to get *really* "gearhead" we could
allow for scaling bonuses at such sizes :-)

Another possibility is muon-catalyzed fusion. If you inject megative
muons (mu mesons) into the plasma, they replace electrons, and allow
the protons to get *much* closer. This gives you fusion at *much* lower
temps and pressure. The problem is generating the muons. By any chance
woul TL-12 be the level at which the meson gun first shows up? If so,
that would tie in nicely. The same breaktrough that allows the meson
gun would also allow the smaller reactors. Even if meson guns show up
at TL-11, it\'d still work, you just say that it took another TL worth
of developement to make it suitable for use in a reactor instead of a
weapon.

Either of the above (revolutionary new field config, or muon catalyzed
fusion) should do as "fusion plus".

You could look at it either way, of course. Book 2 and Supplement 4(?)
characters were fine for roleplaying, but greatly outclassed by Book
4-7 characters. It\'s somewhat frustrating when a Book 4 character has
more brains than the Scientist, more brawn than the Barbarian, more
bargaining skills than the (non-advanced) Merchant, etc.

If you wanted characters with "advanced" skills, your best bet was to
let the Referee design all of the characters from scratch so they were
balanced (based on player input).

   On my list of FF&S fixes would be the following:

1) A method for calculating ship crews based on better automation
(more computer control, use of robots).

2) Fixing the formula for calculating the weight of mass drivers
projectiles, which causes mass drivers guns to consume far too much
energy.

3) Not in FF&S, but a robot design sequence that yields lighter robots,
particularly at high tech levels.

4) An established upper limit for laser power based on TL.

5) Improved leg transmissions at higher tech levels for robots, walker
vehicles, etc. (I\'ve been working on this myself).

   Other items, like a water craft design sequence are probably not in the
cards.  Any thoughts?

Actually, you misrepresent things slightly here.  GDW licensed & 
approved quite a bit of stuff that is not regarded as "canon" by this 
group as well...or did you forget about Judges Guild and Paranoia 
Press?

Also, quite a bit of GDW\'s "canon" contradicts itself.  Badly, in some 
instances.  HEPlaR (TNE) vs. Thruster Plates (CT & MT).  DGP\'s 
Sparklers/Baddies From The Core (MT)  vs. TNE\'s Empress Wave.  Two 
completely different sets of Ships of the Imperium (CT v. MT).  The 
press releases from JTAS re. the 5th Frontier War contradict the flow 
of the campaign to some extent as shown in Spinward Marches Campaign.  

I guess what I\'m trying to say is that you\'ll have to pick and choose 
a little bit from the mounds of published material...if you read 
something you don\'t like throw it out, because GDW has in newer books 
more than once...

As far as sources for the "canon", Glenn\'s answer is correct.

Old JTAS\'s & Challenge (which succeeded JTAS)
Imperial Encyclopedia (MT)
Library Data (CT)
CT Alien Modules 8 in all (1 for each major race + Darrians)
DGP Alien Modules
Various Adventures & Games written over the years (Fifth Frontier 
War, Imperium, Invasion Earth, all of the DGP & GDW published 
adventures)

A couple of others he didn\'t mention:
Travellers Digest/MegaTraveller Journal by DGP (a good magazine at 
the time when GDW cut back coverage of the game from a quarterly 
totally devoted to CT to a bimonthly with a couple of articles in it.

Rebellion Sourcebook
Hard Times

All of this stuff is long out of print of course.  Expect collectors 
prices if you try to pick them up.  I hope someday for the newer 
people on the list that some of this stuff is released in some form 
for newer players to enjoy.  Frankly, much of the old CT stuff was 
fun precisely because the "canon" wasn\'t so well developed.

Yes, indeed.  I suppose the summary would be that, if there will be an 
advanced character generation process such as that used in Books 4-7, 
then it should be used for all character types.  And, as I mentioned 
before, I\'d sure like to see a predominance of non-military characters 
(ie, 7 out of 10 should be non-military in nature).  
And, of course, as you said, each character type should have advantages 
in its own area of experties (ie, Merchants, on average, come out with 
better trading skills than any other character type, etc.)

I wonder what IG has planned . . .

I agree with this comment.  The advanced character generation was *so* 
advantageous that no player would willingly forego it -- we need advanced 
systems for *all* character careers, or none.  I prefer "all."

tied the virus into the rules, making official background part of the rule

published background was often a source of imformation for me I always
wanted to develop my own backgrounds and settings.  

The second reason (IMHO) that both MegaTraveller and TNE failed is due to
the massive number of typos in the rule books.  SIX PAGES of error

Good luck to MMT!  My order for a signed copy has already been placed!

like they are not totally set on this yet.  If everyone who feels as I do
emails Don Perrin (dperrin@mag7.com) (who is writing Starships) or other
folks at IG we may convince them to use thruster plates instead. 

Why keep thruster plates?

1) Using a reaction drive means ships need to refuel a whole lot more
often, so possibilities for in-system exploration are much more limited.

2) There is much more book-keeping for players and GMs to keep track of.  
With T-plates you only need to worry about refueling for jumps, this is 
much less of a pain.

3) The idea of having contra-grav w/o reactionless drives just strikes me
as silly.  If you want a Hard SF game drop *both* contra-grav *and*
T-plates. If you want soft SF, don\'t mix-n-match. 

4) Loosing thruster platers and gravitic maneuver drives also means that
air-rafts now seem remarkably silly.  Air rafts and grav bikes now must
have ducted fans or jets on them.  Air-rafts built for vacuum worlds need
rockets!  If some nifty, high-tech solution to propelling small vehicles
could be found about half my problem would be solved, the idea of needing
to stick a ducted fan or a jet on a TL 15 air-raft seems both silly and
inelegant. 

5) How about if Thruster plates were a TL 12 invention?  Yet another
reason the Imperium is so popular.  HEPLaR would exist out on the fringes
while the core areas would be using T-plates.  I quite like this idea. 

Act now and we may save them.

I usually hate "bravo" or "me too" posts, but that one phrase, \'be the

any of this \'canon\' crap.

A good referee IS the canon, the only canon needed.

 I think that the decision to reduce crew size should be just that, a
design decision. A post somewhere discussed the differences between an
LA-class attack sub and a Swedish sub. Other design differences aside,
one of the design factors that US warships deal with is damage control
and fire fighting. You may only need one guy to man the helm, but you
sure would like to have the other three around to put out a fire. 

My group plays realistics rules given post combat recoeveries. If they
do not have the damage control teams to fix things, they suffer.

I would apply any modifiers to size (volume) of controls versus the
crew they replace as a conscious design decision.

As I said earlier, I consider both Thruster Plates and HEPlaR to be
non-canonical, since both put powerful weapons in the hands of too
many people. The solution is simple: specify that tremendous amounts
of energy are not required in order to reach the speeds that are
commonly attained by Trav ships. HEPlaR ships could still exist, but
newer ships would run rings around them. I can come up with a simple
technological contrivance that makes this possible (it could affect
other aspects of maneuvering if you wish). I\'m sure you can too
(but be careful to balance the laws of conservation of energy and
momentum even when relativistic effects are considered).

I consider this necessary for consistency in the primary Traveller
campaign universe. The issue of whether or not reaction mass is
needed never bothered me, though--have it either way. The lower
energy requirements will mean that maneuver fuel would more likely
last for months than hours, though (especially at higher TLs).
(Actually, I kind of like the idea of using reaction mass--it is
more fitting with ship drawings. The purpose of the rocket exhaust
would be to "get the reaction mass out of the zeta field" or some
such contrivance, not to funnel tremendous amounts of energy.)

Do you see why a contrivance like this is necessary?

HEPlaR: everyone has a giant fusion gun

Thruster Plates: everyone has a relativistic planet killer

"zeta field": makes either of the above work, but implies that you
              will have lots of maneuver fuel (at least at high TLs)

opens up a hole into jump space and the thrust is output there?  The

little of it is needed to get huge amounts of thrust.  Some 
version/part of the reaction mass comes back as energy (some of it 
being short wavelength light or something that breaks down into SWL, to 
give that beautiful blue glow).  Works for me, though it of course 
violates lots of laws :-).

Another possibility would be to have m-drives be "warp drives".  They
expand the space behind the ship while contracting it in front of the
ship, and the ship "surfs" the wave of expanding space.  There is a more
official name for this type of drive, but I can\'t remember it.  I do
remember that it has been mentioned as one of the few ideas for FTL 
travel that sorta fits with modern physics.  However, there\'s no reason 
(I think) that this sort of idea couldn\'t be used for slower than light.  
You can just put some sort of arbitrary limit on it (this is 
pseudo-science after all) and say that it can provide no more than 6g 
acceleration, but that it does so with high efficiency.  Since the ship 
is not actually accelerated through space, there is no violation of laws 
of conservation.

    'topic' => 'Suggestions for FFS Light.',
    'body' => 'Hi David.  I admire your dedication to this project.  Keep it up!  I 
would like to make a few (hopefully helpful) suggestions:

	The first is a reminder to keep things simple.  I like what your
doing so far, but you should be wary of the temptation to complicate
things.  Remember that something you design always seems really simple to
you, but may not be to others.  Some possibilities you might want to
consider (not being an FFS aficionado, I\'m not sure if these are feasible,
but here goes...): 

SIMPLIFYING SUGGESTIONS

1) Regarding the problem of hull armor and bracing for thrust.  Could you 
not simply declare a certain minimum armor value for a certain thrust 
value?  Or are bracing and armor seperate?

2) Why can\'t jump fuel just be 10% of the ship\'s volume per parsec?

3) When assigning crew, why not include their quarters with the 
components as you buy them?  For instance, if you just installed 200 tons 
of drives, why not have a "mini step" afterwards in which you put in 
staterooms for the 2 engineers that will be required (or 1 room if ship 
is military).


FUSION PLUS SUGGESTION

	I\'m no phsicist, but aren\'t there a number of different fusion
reaction types (e.g. deuterium-deuterium, dueterium-tritium), and don\'t
these have different efficiencies?  Perhaps the d-d reaction is too
inefficient and plants below a certain size don\'t provide appreciable
amounts of energy.  But when one masters d-t reactions, one can get good
energy out of even a small plant.  The above is sort of sketchy, but maybe
someone with more a physics background can fill it in. 


MANEUVER DRIVE LIMITS

	On your web page you expressed a problem with the 6 g limit,
saying that it seems quite arbitrary.  Also, people have frequently
complained about the huge upper limit of velocity for ships with thruster
plates.  I have a suggestion that might solve both problems.  I was
thinking that t-plates might be thought of as slower-than-light "warp
drives" (there\'s a more official name, but I can\'t think of it right now). 
These drives expand space behind a ship and contract it in front, allowing
the ship to "surf" the wave of expanding space behind it. 

	This drive concept has been put forth in various fairly reputable
places as one of the few ideas for FTL travel that doesn\'t violate modern
physics (more or less), but I don\'t see why it could not be used as the
basis of a maneuver drive.  One simply has to put arbitrary limits on it. 
Normally, I don\'t like arbitrary limits, but since this is
quasi-scientific anyway, it should be a little easier to take.  The
handwaving explanation could be something like "the fabric of space/time
will not tolerate expansion /contraction rates above a certain limit, and
thus 6 g is all the thrust one can get out of such a drive".  This also
allows one to put an uppper limit on the speed of the ship with "the
expansion/contraction limits also place a maximum of .1 C on the speed of
a ship using such a drive"  or something like that. 

Hope this helps,
Charles.

Being a newbie to Traveller (I believe the only newbie on the list?) I can
sya that I got a lot of the Traveller stuff at non-collector\'s prices.

I got the MT Boxed Set, the Aslan & Solomani, 101 Vehicles (Also could have
gotten Starship Operator\'s Manual but didn\'t have the cash) and the ORIGINAL
CT boxed set (those little black books) for a measly price.  I\'m also gonn a
be shortly buying the Traveller book, also for a nice, discounted price :)

Yes, there are several of us who agree with your assessment.  We also 
like the idea of having the number of non-military advanced generation 
character types far outweight the number of military ones.  Another point 
that has been brought up is that each character generated under a 
specific generation system should be, on average, better than any other 
character type /in his specialty/.  That is, Merchant characters should 
be best at trade, for example.  Under the CT system, a character 
generated under the basic rules for Marchants could easily end up with 
less trade-related skills than a character generated under the advanced 
military character rules.

Which, of course, is just a long way of saying, "I agree." :)

Hopefully, these changes will be implemented in T4, since it is going to 
have 10 character types (if I am no mis-remembering).

THE TRAVELLER UNIVERSE
Traveller is a comprehensive science-fiction future with its origins in the
distant past. Fundamental to the Traveller concept are answers to myriad
questions about life, society, civilization in the universe. Yet everything
is part of a cohesive structure that gradually unveils itself to the
participants and to observers (whether they be readers, viewers, or players).
Traveller describes a vast future universe in which mankind has already
reached the stars and conquered thousands of worlds, but still faces the
never-ending struggle to conquer more worlds and wrest more secrets from the
universe.

FOUNDED ON BOTH HARD AND SOFT SCIENCE
Traveller is founded on the sciences: technological science and social
science. Each adds realism to the systems universe while enhancing its
adventure potential.

TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCE PROVIDES A FOUNDATION
The technological basis for Traveller provides a common ground from which all
extrapolations and story ideas can spring.
		The Jump Drive. The secret of interstellar travel is the jump drive. While
in normal space, travel is limited to the speed of light (and it takes years
to go from one star to another), jump drive leaps around space: a jump covers
one parsec (3.26 light years; the average distance between stars) in about a
week. Improved ships can reach speeds of more than 1,000 times the speed of
light.
		Communication Limited To The Speed Of Transportation. But the universe is
so vast that even the mega-speeds of jump drive cant work miracles. No one
has yet (or ever) invented a hyper communicator that will send messages
faster than light -speed. Communication is limited to the speed of
transportation; a message to the edge of the empire needs to be carried
there. For an empire 300 parsecs to the border that message takes more than a
year to deliver, even under the best of circumstances. News of war, conflict,
invasion, disaster, or even peace takes just as long to get back to the
center of government.
		Gravity Manipulation. The advance of technology has resulted in practical
methods of gravity manipulation. Gravity manipulation expresses itself in
three ways: as artificial gravity, as inertial dampers, and as thrusters.
Artificial gravity is built into the deck plates of starships, rendering a
natural environment most like that of a planet surface. Inertial dampers
eliminate the extremes of inertia which can pull and push people and
equipment as it maneuvers. Although such dampers are imperfect, they do allow
a normal environment on starships as they maneuver, and they allow extreme
physical maneuvers on small craft as they perform high-G maneuvers.
 Thrusters are the final aspect of gravity manipulation: they move vehicles
forward without the necessity of reaction mass (as required for rockets).
Thrusters work like rockets, but without the requirements for large amounts
of rocket fuel.
		Fusion Power. Cheap fusion power means that the inhabitants of this
universe are not tied to gas stations or complex fuel systems. Hydrogen taken
from water, ice, even the methane of gas giants like Jupiter is all that is
required to produce abundant electricity. Once a culture rises to the minimum
required tech level, its cities depend on electricity produced by efficient,
pollution free fusion power. Starships draw their fuel from the worlds they
visit.

SOCIAL SCIENCE ADDS CHARACTER AND FLAVOR
The social sciences add a characteristic flavor to this universe by
emphasizing the effects of the social sciences on societies in the universe.
Psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, and economics all impact the
activities of the people and the stories of this universe.
		A Cosmopolitan Universe. Traveller is a diverse, heterogeneous universe
composed of many different factions, concepts, races, communities, and
individuals. People (and the term is used to refer to "beings") come in many
different forms, all of whom constantly interact as a matter of course.
Naturally, there is conflict, antagonism, friction, and strife between
various groups, but the universe itself allows any with talent to rise to the
top.
		A Human Dominated Universe. Through a combination of fortuitous accident
and strong-willed effort, humanity has reached a position of dominance in the
universe. Three distinct groups of humans (the Vilani, the Solomani, and the
Zhodani) have each created empires that span thousands of stars and trillions
of citizens. In addition, more than a hundred additional human societies
scattered among the stars; each is, in its own way, a commentary on the
strengths and the particular weaknesses of the human condition.
		Duty, Honor, and Loyalty. Naturally (see: Communication Limited To The
Speed Of Transportation), interstellar society values people (human or not)
on whom it can depend: those who are loyal and who faithfully do their duty
are the ones to whom society awards responsibility. A natural nobility arises
of those leaders of society who faithfully and with innovation follow the
orders of their superiors. At the same time, superiors have learned to
express their orders in the most general of terms: to give greater freedom of
action.
		There Is No "Prime Directive." Interstellar governments have never felt it
their duty to impede development, especially economic development. As a
result, no government has ever promulgated the "Prime Directive (that
undeveloped cultures and societies be allowed to develop without interference
until they can enter the community of interstellar civilizations). Instead,
economic forces have driven the development of those worlds rich in natural
or exploitable resources, and have retarded the development of worlds without
resources.
		Everything Is Driven By Economics. Regardless of the pronouncements of
political, moral, or cultural leaders, action in this universe takes place
because it will produce some economic advantage. Economic advantage generally
means rewards in a monetary sense, but it can also mean rewards in political
or social power. But at the foundation of all action is economics.
		Wheels Within Wheels. The quest for meaning is always fruitful in the
Traveller universe. Events, ideas, concepts, and beliefs are shaped by
environments, but they are also shaped by the thinkers themselves. And as
those thinkers (be they readers, players, or viewers) learn and mature, they
begin to have new insights into their beliefs. For example, the uninformed
consider the Zhodani (an human race with some ability in psionics) an evil
empire intent on destroying the Imperium. Only with time is it possible to
see these Zhodani as humans with families, goals and desires just like other
humans. And only with time is it possible to see that some Zhodani are evil.
In the Traveller system, Wheels within Wheels constantly shows new ideas and
new facets of old ideas to the participants.

ADVENTURE!
Above all, this universe is filled with adventure. Individuals can own
starships and travel on their own to distant worlds. Individuals can
undertake literally world-shattering missions whose results depend on their
personal courage and resources. Individuals are the key to discovery,
progress, and the turning points in history.
The Traveller system addresses adventure through three specific areas:
Casual Players. Any role-player can play Traveller. The concepts are
intuitive: combat, travel, tasks. Individuals can role-play diverse
characters or they can play themselves.
Detailed Role-Players. Traveller provides dedicated gamers the opportunity to
role-play complex characters with strong motivations and intricate
backgrounds. The Traveller system can be as casual or as rich as the
participants want it to be.
Systems Engineers. The Traveller system provides referees and game masters
the materials with which to explore the Traveller universe in detail.
Starship design systems, world generation systems, vehicle description
systems, trade and commerce systems, animal generation and encounter systems.
Each is produced with two specific goals in mind: as a prod to the
imagination, and to allow game masters opportunities to create custom
equipment or information.

HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE
The universe are we know it was irrevocably influenced by a meek pastoral
intelligent race (the Droyne) which evolved some 200 parsecs from Earth some
300,000 years ago. The activities of these people continues to be felt
throughout time and space.
Grandfather (300,000 BC). One of the Droyne was born a mutation incredibly
intelligent and incredibly talented. In his first few years, he realized the
full import of his talents and used them to conquer his world and his people
(not that either really resisted). This super-genius Droyne (called
Grandfather by modern anthropologists) then turned his attention to space,
invented space ships and then starships with jump drive. He and his people
ventured out into the universe. He raised a family of super-genius children
(nearly as smart as he) and they scattered to settle hundreds of worlds, each
engaged in some sort of scientific research. Grandfather invented immortality
(for himself only it seems; he shared a lesser form of it with his children).
He invented energy sources, world shattering weapons, mind-boggling
transportation systems, and pocket universes. Much of what he invented is
still unattainable to modern man.
At some point, he and his children had a disagreement which escalated into
galaxy wide war. That war completely destroyed the Ancients and their
thousands of cities on hundreds of worlds. The modern universe can see the
fossil remnants of this war on worlds which still bear the scars of
super-high-tech war, and in Ancient sites: the ruins of those war-spoiled
cities.
But there is another, less obvious, reminder of the Ancients. At some time in
their travels, the Ancients visited Earth and carried away several thousand
near-intelligent cavemen. Grandfathers children must have found them useful
in some way because they took them to hundreds of worlds. At the end of the
Ancient War, the Ancients were dead, but humanity lived on. Each of those
planets became a new world which humans conquered and created a unique yet
human culture.
The Vilani Era (4700 BC to 2300 AD). The first of these many human races to
reach the stars was the Vilani. About 5,000 BC, they began to create a
star-spanning empire through their monopoly on the jump drive. Only they had
the secret of faster than light travel, and they used it to monopolize trade
and dominate both human and non-human cultures for dozens of light years
around. Eventually, the Ziru Sirkaa (as the Vilani Empire was called) became
a rigid, brittle culture dedicated to maintaining the status quo. Laws,
politics, social pressure all emphasized conformity and resistance to change.
Innovation and technological change were prohibited. Their four thousand year
empire was drawing to an end.
The Terran Confederation (2100 to 2300 AD). In about 2100, Earth invented the
jump drive and reached the stars, only to find them already taken.
Fortunately for tiny Earth, the Vilani Empire ignored the Terran upstarts
long enough for them to gain a foothold among the stars. Over the course of
200 years, the Vilani and the Terrans fought a dozen interstellar wars, each
one seemingly inconclusive, but edging the Vilani Empire closer to collapse.
In 2299, the Vilani were defeated so soundly that they surrendered.
The Rule of Man (2300 to 2750 AD). Terra, with perhaps a hundred worlds in
its confederation, now faced the immense task of ruling, as a conquered
territory, the now collapsed Ziru Sirka, with 40,000 worlds. Terra created
the Rule of Man: the Second Imperium, to govern these conquered worlds, often
assigning mere lieutenants as governors of worlds, and naval captains to rule
subsectors of 30-40 worlds. It was a losing battle. Nothing, not
technological innovation, not social change, not new blood, not threat of
outside invasion, was sufficient to raise the former Vilani worlds from their
cultural lethargy. Slowly, over the course of 400 years, the worlds of the
Rule of man drifted into a dark age.
The Long Night (2750 AD to 4550 AD). When interstellar trade shut down, the
Rule of Man ceased as an interstellar government. Each world found itself on
its own, living or dying on its own resources. Outpost worlds dependent on
food or supplies shipped in from agricultural worlds simply died. Scattered
starship trade kept other worlds alive, but after a few centuries, even the
starships stopped running. Each world found itself along in a sea of space,
completely dependent on its own resources. This Long Night lasted for more
than 1700 years.
The Third Imperium (4521 to 5637 AD). One world tenuously held on to its
technology, its resources, and its knowledge, remaining a beacon of hope in
the Long Night. Ultimately, it began its own reconquest of the worlds of the
former empire under the Starburst Banner of the Third Imperium. From a base
of a dozen worlds, the Third Imperium began a systematic effort to recontact
the 40,000 worlds of the old Ziru Sirka and bring them under one rule. Some
accepted immediately; others resisted, but none could resist the combined
military might and economic incentives that the Imperium could offer. Over
the next 500 years, the empire reached out to absorb tens of thousands of
worlds.
The Aslan Border Wars (3400 to 4900 AD). The conflict of the Aslan against
the Imperium along their common border.
The Vargr Campaigns (4700 to 4900 AD). The conflict of the Vargr against the
Aslan along their common border.
The Barracks Emperors (5100 to 5140 AD). The defining power struggle of the
military hierarchy and the ruling noble families of the Imperium as competing
factions fight to be the ones that rule the interstellar empire.
The Solomani Expansion (5121 AD to 6500 AD). The struggle of the Solomani
worlds (both within and outside the Imperium) as they endeavor to establish a
community of worlds.
The Rebellion (5367 AD). The Imperium, now more than a thousand years old, is
split asunder as competing factions fight to create the next Emperor, or to
chart their own path outside the established Imperium.

THERES MORE!
There is so much more to the Traveller universe that can only be touched on
here: The Zhodani expeditions to the core of the galaxy. The Psionic
Suppressions. The Julian War. The Ilelish Revolt. The First Survey. The
Solomani Rim Wars. The Hiver Interventions. The Virus Era. The Regency. The
Far Far Future. The Expeditions to the Rim. The Heat Death of the Universe.
Each of these milieux (or eras) is another opportunity to provide
participants with adventure and insight into the human condition as they
explore the comprehensive science-fiction universe that is Traveller.

Again, we need to remember that Thurster plates aren\'t the only
reactionless drive.  I personally don\'t like thruster plates but
have no objection to reactionless drives in general.

[Similar points deleted]

Actually, not.  The lack of thruster plates gives and elegant solution
to the question of how Air Rafts exist but can be used for interplanetary
travel.  Antigravity works by pushing against a body.  As you get into
space there are not always sufficiently close bodies in a desired
direction.  That is why they are so poor for space ships.  I give
Air Rafts penalties to piloting rolls as they get further away from
a plant.

Actually, as you\'ve probably noticed, there\'s been a thread running 
on it.  In the past, I\'ve had a tendency to tweak non Advanced 
characters running in the same game as advanced...  I think that a 
good improvement for T4 would be to go ahead and do advanced 
character generation options for "ALL" character classes.

You did bother to read TNE didn\'t you?  Sure Virus was a major factor in the
rule book but any stup\' with two cents worth of imagination is more than
capable of creating his own corner of the universe, thats that all that
sector generating stuff was for in the middle, remember that?  And if you
wanted to you were more than welcome to alter the settings as you saw fit.
The reason so much space was devoted to the Virus theme was there were a
fair number of us out there who actually gave a damn about what happened in
the rebellion.  I\'m fairly sure most people would have been fairly pissed
had they received a book of nothing but rules that contained the following
disclaimer at the back.

"By the way you\'ll notice that this book tells you nothing about the end
results of the Rebellion.  Why?  Now don\'t get pissy on us but we\'ve learned
a thing or two from FASA and we\'ve decided to publish fifteen more source
books about the rebellion, gouging the money from your pockets and still
never reveal what happened.  See you in two weeks when the next book comes
out sucker."

By including a section on virus and the new era in the rule book it allowed
those of us who gave a damn to find out what happened to the universe.  By
publishing stuff on virus it gave us insight into the mind of the creature
that finished off what a string of wannabe emperors were incapable of.
Virus was an integral part of the Traveller universe in 1201 and if you
didn\'t like it a little elbow grease and some dice allowed you to create a
universe of your own.

Ok I\'ll give you the typo\'s part.  GDW was terrible at catching it\'s own
mistakes.  However unlike most compainies they cared enough about their
public to publish errata as opposed to just leaving it in there and waiting
for a second and third printing.  Considering the volume of material
produced.  TNE weighs in at a hefty 300+ pages of some fairly wieghty
technical gear.  Plus much of the errata created for TNE was a direct result
of people nit picking the design sequences in FF&S.  Its not like we didn\'t
make our own erratta there.

        I\'m not sure how *reducing* the amount of energy to reach a certain
speed takes the kinetic energy weapon away ... if you cut the energy to
reach speed A from Energy to 0.25Energy, that just means that if I still
spend Energy I now get up to 2*A! So the ship becomes an even *more*
powerful weapon.

        They\'re separate ...

        Originally (in FF&S), because the new maneuver drives required much
more fuel, so the jump drive fuel was scaled way down. Since thruster plates
are back, the jump fuel probably will go back up.

        I still think even basic designers will want some flexibility in
deciding how the accommodations should be arranged -- who gets single
stateroom, who gets double. Plus, the crew listed in the tables is the
*base* non-automated crew. Depending on TL the crew requirements go way
down, and it\'s easiest if you collect them all and do it all at once.

        Thanks for the inputs!

Think about it, former military types are going to be far more prone to

strong roleplaying to strong military campaigning, but I think perhaps the
split should be more like 60/40 rather than 70/30 (civilian-military).

Traveller characters are not meant ot represent a cross section of
Imperial society.  They are the bold, the adventuresome, the cream of the
crop.  A higher proportion would be drawn to military careers (including
Scouts in there) than to civilan professions.

Just my 2 cents.

IG has come right out and said that there will be no more dying during

I was wondering if you noticed this.  Weren\'t the Vargr coreward of the Imperium, and the Aslan 
rimward-spinward?  I was just wondering.  You certainly have the right as the creator to change it.

It sounds neat. I have some questions though: 

1. Will the rule set for T4 be separable from the background history ? 

2. Is there a logical technical reason that Traveller does not use

logical technical reason why Traveller does not have FTL communication?

According to "logic," both FTL travel _and_ FTL communications should be
impossible.  Marc is limiting suspension-of-disbelief problems by only
invoking one -- aside from the fact that communication limited to speed
of travel causes fascinating social ramifications and provides a good
justification for the classic-space-opera Empire motif.

As to why Traveller doesn\'t use "warp drive"?  Aside from the technical
quibbles of then having to explain edge effects at the bubble boundary,
dealing with the difficulties of FTL combat using c-speed sensor info
(or having to invoke yet _another_ bugaboo to allow FTL detection!), well...

It\'s because Traveller isn\'t Star Trek, but a different and completely 
separate universe with its own set of assumptions.  Go play Prime Directive
if that\'s what you want.

(Reminds me of the guy who wrote JMS to complain that the back-of-hand links
on Babylon-5 were ridiculous, given that everyone _knew_ we were moving
towards breast-mounted (ST:TNG-style) communicators instead....)

That would be the Alcubierre (sp?) drive.  There\'s a web page somewhere with 
some more details (I may even have it on my hotlist).  But it requires some
fairly grotesque space-warping capabilities that would probably also allow
dandy weapons: I\'d rather leave it to Grandfather and his ilk than the common
mass of PC\'s.  :-)

I agree in principle here.  Given anit- (or contra-) grav, some kind of
reactionless thruster seems inevitable from a game-logical standpoint. 
Arguing physics of reactionless drives is pointless given J-drive exists.
>From a play PoV, 1 and 2, above, are the biggest reasons for T-plates.  

Since I don\'t own FF&S, I\'m not intimately familiar with the operating
principle of HEPLaR.  It sounds like it\'s just a complicated
fusion-powered ramjet which uses the helium waste from the reactor for
reaction mass in space and plasma-heated air in atmosphere.  Why on
Sylea can\'t fusion rockets (which admittedly would make good plasma guns
at short range, see HG v1) have auxiliary intakes for use in atmosphere
to dilute the exhaust temperature and velocity?  A hybrid system like
this would have the advantages of Fusion Rockets in space and HEPLaR in
atmosphere.  The fuel consumption of fusion rockets is low enough to be
able to carry weeks of fuel.

I agree with you for the most part.  Ex-military, merchie, and scouts 
are going to be predominant.

However, there are a few civilian occupations which would be just as 
likely to adventure, and should therefore be candidates for advanced 
treatment.  

The new Researcher that Marc Miller has alluded to strikes me as a 
natural for this type of treatment.

Scientist (lots of these types are going to Travel for conventions, 
research, etc).
Diplomat 
Pirate 
Belter
Let\'s face it Pirates and Belters are going to travel at least as 
much as ex-military types.  In fact, probably more than veterans of 
the army, in many cases.

1 more thought.
Just because a particular career type isn\'t likely to be a Traveller, 
doesn\'t mean that they aren\'t going to develop just as many skills 
over the course of a lifetime as a Merchant Captain.  It just means 
that they will be different types of skills (and perhaps less useful 
to the game).  Advanced character generation should be offered as 
an option for all character types, if for no other reason than to 
really flesh out a critical NPC or Patron.

SOME PHYSICS...

The vacuum isn\'t empty - it contains both electromagnetic and gravitational
fields.  According to the quantum electrodynamics it isn\'t possible to get
rid of an electromagnetic field completely.  The argument is as follows: if
the electromagnetic energy density at a position X is zero, then the field
strength there is known exactly - its zero.  However, according to the
Principle of Uncertainty it isn\'t meaningful to talk about a field having an
exact value, zero or otherwise, and therefore even in the absence of any
source for the electromagnetic field, the field exists: it arises
spontaneously in accordance with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

This means the vacuum is seething with energy.  Unfortunately, we can\'t get
at it.  The quanta of energy that spontaneously arise (zero-point energy)
can only exist for a short period of time without violating the same
Uncertainty Principle, typically 10E-24 seconds.

SOME SCI-FI...

However, imagine we COULD get at this energy.  We would then have a
limitless supply of power without needing any fuel at all.  I suppose this
energy could be used for propulsion or high tech power sources...


Off the top of my head I can\'t think of any pseudo-scientific explanation
for how this zero-point energy might be converted into thrust other than by
heating some reaction mass, but I thought I\'d throw it into the
HEPlaR/Plates discussion because it does provide a (loose) scientific basis
for a high-tech drive and it seems to me that GM\'s dislike HEPlaR because
its too grubby and low-tech and dislike thrusters because they\'re silly (tin
hat on! :-)).

I haven\'t done anything with this idea: it just occured to me as I was
reading this morning\'s digest.  Perhaps someone would like to take it and
run with it...

PS I can\'t vouch for the physics 100%, its years since I was obliged to
study the subject, but the general thrust of the point is correct. (fingers
