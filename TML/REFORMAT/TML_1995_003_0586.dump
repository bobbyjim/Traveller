Notes 
N-PAW is a spinal mount weapon 
 
 
Another companion vessel to the Jayhawk Enforcer, the Camelot Gig carries a
fairly substantial, if short-ranged punch to take on heavier vessels.  The
Particle Accelerator spinal mount will provide a nasty surprise to
predatory vessels. 
 
The redesigned Camelot loses it\'s Contra-Grav and reduces it\'s AEMS to
180,000km and the hull goes from AF to SL in order to accomodate the
corrected acceleration.  It also loses it\'s missile capablility. 
 
Note that the cost of the Enforcer plus Avalon comes in at MCr 131.28 while
the Enforcer plus Camelot is MCr 134.93 (no standard discount factored in).
 The listed price of the Jayhawk is MCr 57.50 (presumed to be 80%
discounted price).  200% of the prototype Jayhawk cost = MCr 143.75.  Thus
the Enforcer plus one of either small craft comes in at below 200% of base.

If the laser isn\'t grav focused the HPG is only 30.8kl.

included the design notes, for anyone new to FF&S (they don\'t take up too
much space).

TL-14 700Mj Laser Barbette (X-ray, trainable, grav-focused)

1/ Tech Level:  14

2/ Gravitic focusing present

3/ Focal Array:  4.5m diameter

   M  = 11.13 m^3
   P  = MCr 2.227

5/ Performance
   FA diameter = 4.5m = 45dm
   F (focal value) = (5D)^2 = 50625
   R (maximum range) = F/10 * Range factor
                     = 5.062 x 10^9 km (a bloody long way)

6/ Beam Pointer:  300,000km (10 hexes) range
   V = 6m^3

   P = MCr0.6

   Weapon short range = 10 hexes

7/ Damage:  DV = 2.5*(I^0.5)
   I = DE(1/R^2), where R = laser actual range/base range
   Since range is greater than the laser\'s base range for all ranges, I = DE
   (if R < 1 then R = 1)

   STF, DV = 2.5*(DE^0.5)
           = 66

   Penetration rating:  IPR = (I^0.5)*0.8
   i.e. IPR = (DE^0.5)*0.8
            = 21
   STF, PR = 1/21

8/ Power source and ROF

   TL-14 Homopolar Generator, 3500 Mj capacity
   V = 140 m^3
   M = 280 t
   P = MCr 1.4

   Power requirements:  ROF  10 = 19.44 MW
                        ROF  50 = 97.22 MW
                        ROF 100 = 194.4 MW

Surface area = 15,91 m^2
Mass = 297.13 t
Price = MCr 4.227
Power = 19.44 MW (97.22 MW ROF 50, 194.4 MW ROF 100)

Damage   10:1/21-66 20:1/21-66 40:1/21-66 80:1/21-66

NB:  This weapon does NOT fit into a standard barbette mount.

So here I am hacking up my FFS design du jour.  I\'m creating that
anthopoid robot I\'ve always been meaning to get around to.  Well, it\'s
all good and he seems funky and fine.

Alas, but wait, I\'ve got some problems (suh-prize, suh-prize,
suh-prize).  I\'m looking at my design and I\'m wondering why the hell
he\'s so heavy.  At .1kl he masses 20.130 tonnes.  Then I look at the
design.  My god!  Two .01 kl arms mass 20 tonnes!  What?!?

Am I misreading this or what.  Now the rules state that arms mass in
kilograms, 20 times their weight in liters.  This is 100 times as heavy
as any form of suspension and their transmission.  Should this rule be
20 times their weight in kiloliters?  This would bring it back in line
with the other peripherals.

Alas, it was late and I was too tired to reverse engineer their sample
robots (I wish they included an example).

If anyone can shed some light on this, I\'d really appreciate it.

And while I\'m here, has anyone heard from Loren or Dave or anyone else
from GDW?  I haven\'t seen them post anything here for quite a while,
and I sent a letter to gdw.support@genie.geis.com a while back, but
never got any sort of response.

Oh well, as always, thanks in advance...

I doubt very highly that Sabmiqys was affected by the war. I don\'t think

IIRC, Sabmiqys was given a write-up in Challenge #28.  The original 
inhabitants were all killed by a (biological) virus brought back on a 
ship that had been exploring a nearby solar system.  They left behind a 
society of androids who determined that anything from beyond their system 
was too dangerous and too unimportant to study.  This explains why the space 
transport TL is 8.  Also, these androids became highly xenophobic and 
the system was coded as a red zone, so their technology was never 
exported.  Of course, I haven\'t looked at the article in several years so 
I am a bit fuzzy on the details.

Even though it would be extremely poetic to have the Sabmiqys androids 
killed of by Virus, I somehow think (hope) they would be able to withstand 
the onslaught.

This is nearly the largest laser permitted by the unofficial 
laser DE limit of TL*50 MJ.  A twelve-ton "double barbette"
bay has a length of 8 meters and a width of 4.5 meters.

(I went with this size because there is little difference between
a 750 MJ laser and a 730 MJ laser, and this size is easier for
ship designers to work with.) 

The laser has a standard 2.6 meter tunable lens with an effective 
range of 2400 Mm, reinforced to handle rates of fire of up to one 
shot every 2.5 seconds.  It is nearly able to penetrate an armor
value of 1500 at all ranges.  It can penetrate AV 1000 and still
do appreciable damage.  

In theory, the maximum laser bay could be reduced to ten tons by
using x-ray laser lenses or removing the rapid-fire capability, 
or with shorter-range beam pointers.  Just over nine displacement-
tons are required for homopolar generators, ten cubic meters for
the workstation and beam pointer, and the rest is trainable lens.

So a 0.01 kl arm is 10 liters, that\'s 200kg or 0.2 tonnes.

Still heavy, but you\'re off by 2 orders of magnitude.

And, on inspection, the laser is an xray laser that is also *not*
grav focused, so it gets those efficiency bonuses that grav-focus
lasers don\'t, and the design is ok.  With a workstation, the laser
is only slightly bigger than standard turret size, and it\'s at the
TL*50 DE limit.  Verrrry interesting.

  T:NE could definitley be construed as "Dark Trav", but, as some have 
pointed out, it could also be used as "hopeful" Traveller.
  It all comes down to how you want to play it, wich is one of the 
beauties of this universe. It can support a magnitude of "atmospheres".
 The "Ghouls" mentioned in the RSB, I\'ll admit, do remind me alot of 
Vampire: The Masquerade. But this isn\'t nessiciliariley a bad that, VTM 
is actualley a quite good game.
 The thing we have to rember is, that certin groups(Ala Nobles) are in a 
decline, and going through a state of angst now, while other groups are 
filled with hope. The best way(IMHO, of cours) to imagine it is "growing 
pains" of sorts. You could play a city based Cyberpunk game, or a VTM 
game, or a Foundation game, or a CT(ish) game, just depends on how you 
use it, and how much your willing to throw awya some stuff in the 
suppilments.

Wrong. Sorry, I feel I need to defend this, as the use of non GF lasers is one 
of the more interesting features of my designs. As mentioned in the notes, the 
laser is non grav focused. Your massive HPG would be completely true if this 
was a grav focused design where the IE is five times the discharge energy. 
_However_ you may have noticed that the range performance of the laser is 
somewhat inferior to that which you would expect from a TL-15 X-Ray laser. The 
reason for this is because the laser is not grav focused. It has a somewhat 
larger than normal focal array to compensate, but X-Rays really don\'t need grav 
focusing. When you don\'t use grav focusing the energy efficiency at TL-15 is 
0.85.
In case you don\'t believe me, here are the calculations:
DE =750 MJ
IE =750 / 0.85 = 882.35MJ
Volume of 883 MJ HPG = 0.035 * 883 = 30.9kl
Still fairly big, but at least it fits in the fighter.

    'body' => 'Hi all,
	I am not sure how we are supposed to handle design competitions,
but I thought perhaps it was time to air an idea that has been floating
around in my head for a while. As I don\'t really have access to BR nor 
BL, and I have been very busy lately, I haven\'t worked out an FF&S design 
myself yet. and I\'ll spare you the MT one.
So, if anyone thinks this idea is worth pursuing, I would 
be very grateful. but first some background;

Around 1100 the Imperial Navy began to undergo a large organizational
change, related above all to the deployment patterns of it\'s fighting
units. In particular, a large-scale changeover to Battle Rider units
was undertaken. At the same time, the defensive strategy of the Navy
went from "hard shell" to "mobile defense". This meant that most of 
the fighting strength of the Navy was well to the interior of the 
Imperium - leaving Colonial Reserve  units as the front line defence. 
This approach had many advantages - above all, it was cheaper, more 
flexible, and allowed a rapid change of emphasis from defence to  
offence, should the Imperial High command choose such an option.
It was also economically advantageous for several Megagcorporations
which had heavily invested in the new battle rider technology. 
However, there were disadvantages to this approach as well, theworst
being the increased risk to frontier planets. (It was also a prime reason
the Civil War was so destructive.)

The increased risk to the frontiers was felt most strongly in the Domain 
of Deneb, which was always very much at risk from Zhodani attack.
Following intense political pressure from Domain leaders, the navy began 
to investigate the possibility of rapid reinforcement of the Domain defences.
Several measures were implemented - refueling caches along j-4 and j-6 routes
was probably the most effective. 
However, it was at the time felt that there was a need for a new type of 
combat vessel, capable of J-6 deployment, extended operations behind 
invading forces, and a high degree of operational flexibilty.
This new ship would also be able to take on whatever heavy Zhodani units 
it might encounter, or if badly enough outnumbered, it should be able 
to outrun it\'s opponents.

The TL-15 design settled upon was the Cheetah Class Strike Battleship, a fast 
battleship in the 300,000-ton range, capable of carrying 4x 20,000 
battle riders with a performance of J-4, M-6G( ship, not rider), or 
2x20,000 tn riders and two Jump Extension modules giving a J-6, M-4G
performance. Each Jump extension Module replaced one rider and carried 
fuel and power plant for an additional parsec in jump. THus three riders 
and one JEM would give J-5, M-5. the Cheetah could also carry the 
more common 30,000 ton riders if necessary, as long as total tonnage carried 
did not exceed 80,000 tons.
  the Cheetah also carried a battalion of Marine Armoured 
Cavalry complete with a company of grav tanks, as well as 4 squadrons 
of mid-size fighters. This combination of capabilities made the Cheetah 
quite well suited for fast reinforcement,  delaying operations, as well 
as behind-the-lines raiding, force interdiction, and other high-mobility 
operations.  


6 of these vessles were built before the FFW, deployed together with 6 Javelin
class Strike Cruisers in the 1st Strike Wing of BatRon 667, operating out 
of Depot/Deneb. the unit performed well beyond expectations, blunting the 
joint sword worlds/ Zhodani thrust along the Vilis/Mora/Glisten Axis. Several 
holding actions were performed, as well as deep strikes and raids.
as a result of the excellent performance of the Cheetah class, production contracts were signed in 1114, and long-lead items began to be ordered. 
 Unfortunately, the Rebellion intervened, and Domain resources were diverted to 
more pressing needs. 

now, 80 years later, the  regency yet again is in need of a fast, flexible and 
long-legged strike unit. 
for this reason the following request for proposal has been issued;

Type: Strike Battleship, (SBU)
Tech Lvl: 16. Limited 17 - if unit has adequate backup. eg. sensors may be TL-17 if TL-16 backups are carried.  .
Displacement range: 200,000-350,000 tons std.
Maneuver Rating: minimum 4G sustained.
Jump: 6 Parsecs, 4 if carrying full rider complement.
Capabilities: 

Defeat in ship-to-ship combat any two Zhodani units up to 300,000tons each.
Carry up to 4 Connard P, M , E or F class 20,000 battle riders with J-4 performance.

Carry a battalion or more of armoured cavalry.
Carry 4 squadrons of fighters, i.e. approximately 80 craft.

be capable of long term operations with little or no support beyond fleet
tenders and tankers.

Be able to wilderness refuel.
be able to rapidly approach a planetary target for  bombardment and/or 
Marine deployment - in the latter case it shoudl also be capable of 
providing fire support for ground units.

JEM module technology is available and can be provided if your company
 is unfamiliar with the technology.

proposals that make use of antimatter technology will be considered 
independantly - convince us it is feasible and a contract may be 
awarded.

Contracts will be awarded based on results of a Regency Navy evaluation.
price, combat capabilities, flexibility of operations, and maintainability 
will be prime factors in the evaluation. 


End RFP.

What was it someone said? "Food for thought."?

Here are a bunch of HEPlaR missiles to play with.  All have 500kt det-laser 
warheads.  The maximum gs are listed in a slightly different format than
you\'re used to.  Any gs number in () is the "real" value calculated
using the actual mass of the missile.  If the design also has a number
out of the parenthesis, that is the max gs of a straight FFS design (you
can tell this by the fact that the mass is less than 7.5 which is the
15*disp maximum) using the slop rule.  The designs are only valid for
the figure in parenthesis, however due to the internal structure.  Done
in the FFS way the gs would be between the two figures given if the
bracing were done for the intermediate value.

All missiles have an armor value of 3, and are fully braced for the gs
in the parenthesis.  I included the ffs gs to hem in the possibilities

SIM = Semi-Independent Missile
FIM = Fully Independent Missile
Cont. = Controlled

Controlled missiles were optimized to have the biggest gmax possible.

Tactically they are used almost as direct fire weapons.  S/FIMs are used
for longer range applications, and by small craft.  If there is a missile
at the TL with a lower mass, it is more likely to be used on a fighter
since they are also performance limited by their total mass.  

Most S/FIMs are actually used in a target-designated role within sensor
range of the firing craft.  If the launcher has a Lock-On on the target
with an active sensor, use the active sensors short range for the
missile\'s attempt to lock the target.  They are also used in a
Anti-Radiation Missile role (ARM).  If the target is active, use *twice*
the short range of the target\'s active sensor, TL differences are treated as
the jamming task is.

BTW, I use the term "slop rule" because it allows design slop (a good
thing), not as an editorial comment (I\'ll set rant mode on for those
:-)

How often are the digests posted? I got three today!

Little FF&S query: why are laser sights so big/heavy/expensive? I\'ve got
a catalogue here that includes a TL8 laser pointer the size of a pen, with
a range of 20m+, that costs £40 ($60+). There are others, less than twice
the price, that\'ll reach 100m+. How would you design one (the laser rules
are for *pulse* lasers, not beam) - just have a really big ROF?

What\'s new int thwo world of Traveller?  Oh my, you really have been out

You haven\'t heard anything about Traveller: The New Era?

Of course, such a perspective ignores the other benefit of PA armament --

Without making it a spoiler? Hm. Well I can give you some pointers
1/Don\'t make any major investments in real estate in asteroid belts.
2/..or grav cities.
3/..or worlds with inhospitable atmospheres
4/..or worlds with naval bases
5/..or with any big starports
6/Don\'t expect your faction to win the rebellion.

Seriously, you should read:
1/Hard Times - end of Megatraveller
2/Survival Margin - collected history of the Rebellion
3/Traveller:The New Era - replacement for MT
(the first two could be harder to find)
Traveller:The New Era is not just an extension of Megatraveller, it is an 
entirely new system. The New Era is set around 1200 imperial.

FFS is \'Fusion, Fire and Steel\', one of the key books in the new system. If you 
think that the ship building rules in the Referee\'s Manual for MT are 
reasonable, then you\'ll be very impressed with FFS. However, despite GDW\'s 
claims, it isn\'t really any easier to use. Still it does cover planes, ground 
vehicles, grav vehicles, personal armour, cybernetics, spacecraft, guns and 
lasers (but no robots or wet naval ships).

Sorry, but I laughed when I read that, because that was a great way to
rationalize the PAW on that fighter (a good solution----kinda like
justifying a high pop world with a nasty atmosphere :-)

My reasons for agreeing that the PAW is silly?

1.  It is a wimpy PAW (70, right?).  

2.  Because of 1, its only use is for radiation effects, but only civies
will have non Fb computers (that or penny-wise, pound foolish designs).

3.  It\'s a spinal mount, so if you play straight BL, it\'ll rarely be
pointed at a target.

4.  If the mass/volume was filled with a trainable non-grav focused xray
laser it\'d do about the same damage, but it would have a penetration of
1/20something.  The laser armed ship (otherwise the same) in a one on
one will win every time.  The laser will hit at a real range for one.

Now if its stated purpose is cracking small craft that make a point of
placing themselves in the hexrow directly ahead, then it might have a
use, but why not do a few critical hits instead of resetting the guys
computers?

I have to say that I liked the idea of it when I saw it, but not once I
thought about it (from a rules standpoint).  Small PAWs have very little
usefulness as I see it (unless you\'re a pirate and want to damage
sensors, etc on the surface).

I\'ve got a different idea to the TL*50 power limit.

Try 250MW input power per square metre of FA surface area MAXIMUM.

This can be justified by technobabble along the lines of "micro-distortions 
in the FA at relatively low power levels causing beam distortion and heat 
build-up".

Note that this removes a particularly arbitrary looking self imposed limit, 
means that really powerful lasers mass/vol etc increase with the cube of the 
power rather than the square, deals with the HPG problem to some degree and 
makes non-grav focussed lasers worth a really good look.

Well, someone else already pointed out your math error. But I have to
comment that GDW has obviously screwed up again. The above basicly
states that arm have a density of 20 kg/l. It just so happens that this
reduces to 20 g/cm^3. 

This makes the arms slightly denser than gold (19.3) and slightly less
dense than platinum (21?). There are only a couple of elements denser
than platinum, and they aren\'t much denser.

So GDW\'s figures are insane. Again, nobody did any sanity checking.
Consider that if the arms are going to flex, some of the space they
occupy *has* to be empty. So that lowers the density. Plus, you want
alloys with a high styrength to weight ratio, so, again the density
goes down.

I\'d accept 10. But 5 is more like it. For reference, iron, steel and
copper are all around 8, titanium is 4, aluminum is 2, lead is 11, and
mercury is 13.6. 

*Why* can\'t anybody at GDW do simple math?

to duplicate the unit used in the RSB for the Fang SDB and the Cuspid
gunboat.  I ran into a bit of a problem, which I can\'t seem to resolve. 
Merrick and I have tried to work through it, but to no avail so far.  If
anyone from GDW is following the list, perhaps you can provide an answer. 
 
As given, the weapon is a TL 15, 196 Mj N-PAW, powered to -3 DM (ROF 200,
so MW = 20x Normal).  The power use is 109MW.  The tunnel length is given
at 14 meters. 
 
Now, given the FF&S design sequence, max diameter for a PAW tunnel is .125,
so for a 14 M tunnel, max diameter is 1.75 M.  Tunnel diameter 1.75 gives a
FA of 2.41 M.  At TL 15, Effective Length = Actual Length and  the FA
multiplier is 4.  So, Effective Length = 14M and Effective FA = 9.64 M. 
Effective range for an N-PAW=Effective Range X Effective FA X 1000.  With
these values, Effective Range = 134,960 KM, which equates to 4.498 hexes in
BL terms.  Okay so far, the published ratings for this PAW are: 
 
Short        Med        Long        Ext 
5:70            10:41        20:21        40:10 
 
However, if you round the Eff range up to 5 hexes, you come out with a
PVshort of 63, PV med of 32, Long of 16, and Extreme of 8.  If you round it
down to 4 hexes, you come out with PVshort of 79, PVmed of 39, PVlong of
20, and PVext of 10.  This also assumes that, unlike lasers, R _can_ be
less than 1, since the design sequence says round R to the nearest .01, but
doesn\'t say round values of less than 1 to 1. 
 
What do people think?  I\'m curious whether we\'re missing something here.

Hi everyone,

I\'m delurking for the first time with a quick question.

Is there any rough standardisation for the sizes of ships
within a certain class?  I\'m interested as to whether there\'s
any canonical GDW view, but I\'d also be interested in
hearing what any of you use in your campaigns.

What I mean  by this is whether the term \'battleship\', for
example, correlates to a particular range of tonnage -
how big is a battleship?  10,000 tons? 100,000 tons?
As another example, I\'ve seen the term cruiser used in
Traveller to describe ships of between 1200 tons and
60-100,000 tons.  There\'s a big difference in terms of
performance and firepower between the two.  Do you
think that tonnage should be the criteria for describing
a ship\'s class, or should its role do so - so if a local
planetary navy is using a 1000 ton ship as the largest
offensive part of its fleet, that ship is by definition a
battleship?

As a related question, I\'d be interested to know whether
any of you place any maximum limits on ship sizes.

If you reply, I\'d be grateful if you let me know what
campaign setting/set of rules you are using.

Cheers,

Iain

Howdy,

a thread on the xboat list about jump entry signatures got me thinking about 
them.  I\'ve assumed that they\'ll provide a Bogey-Detection (B-D) out to some 
undefined huge distance.  There are some assumptions that need to be worked out 
to take it any farther.

1.  Jump exit sigs are the same regardless of jump number. (yes? no?)

2.  Jump exit sigs change with displacement of ship (bigger ship, bigger flash).


If we take these to be true, then in addition to an automatic B-D, maybe a 
sensor operator might be able to glean other useful information.  This dovetails
with an addition to my sensor rules I\'ve been playing with.


Sensor Rule Additions v0.9

Bogey-Detections (B-Ds) can be "Outstanding."

Automatic B-Ds are considered Outstanding.

Since B-Ds give the range, useful information gleaned from the strength of the 
received signal. 

Outstanding B-Ds give the following benefits 
(Active sensor with DF, or passive sensor):

1.  If the B-D was influenced by the target going active, an outstanding success
indicates the short range of the active sensor (that or the MWs used by the 
sensor).

Outstanding B-Ds give the following benefits (Passive sensor):


1.  If the target used gturns, then the total MW used for thrust that turn are 
known (we know the exhaust has more energy than the input MW, but this gives the
relative energy output of the drive regardless----was that a 1000 ton ship at 
2gs, or a 500 ton at 4gs?

2.  If the target was detected as a bogey because of a jump exit, then the size 
class of the target is known (Small, Medium, Large, Very Large, etc.).


Comments?  Suggestions?  I don\'t have enough of a feel for jump flash to say 
more than this, but the rest seems OK so far.

Yes, alas, I made a horrible math error.  I should really not scratch
numbers onto a piece of paper and then try rattling them off (one of
these days, I\'ll do a design NEATLY).  That coupled with my poor math
skills since I am after all, a product of the American educational
system (bad joke, but I couldn\'t help it).

So anyway, I revised my numbers.  Yet, My design was out of hand.  I
figured out that the thing\'s combat move would be a 4 or 5.  If I got
rid of one or two features and then added more battery space, then I
could get up to a 7.

It just cheesed me off.  I figured out that I wouldn\'t be able to
create AB-101.  Part of me believes that there should be some way to be
mostly backwards compatible with older designs.

I don\'t know, maybe .1 for a human-sized robot is too little (but the
math says it\'s just right).

Then again, why am I complaining, I can\'t even recreate the .5kl Trasea
grav bike under FFS.  8(

Since there can be no really scientific answer, I think we should make 
assumptions based on what is best for game balance and so on.  What I 
generally assume is that the flash varies based on ship size, but not on 
jump number.  What that means is you can tell whether a battleship group 
has jumped into your system or just a courier, but you can\'t tell where 
they came from.
The jump flash isn\'t particularly intense, but it contains very exotic 
particles, so one can pick it up by its unusualness, but can\'t get too 
much info from it (otherwise the defenders have too much advantage).

I think you can get ship size, but that\'s about it.  Of course, this is 
all entirely up to one\'s own intuition.

Commander X\'s Tales from the line vol 3
"DARK TRAVELLER"
or
"Galaxy of Darkness"

Part one: Vampires.

This is an example of game fusion.  White Wolf\'s "World of Darkness" Seting
applied and reconfiged(hacked is a better word) to fit with GDW\'s Traveller
Universe.

(Hey Kids, Don\'t try game fusion at home. The ol\' Commander remembers one
incedent with Rifts and C\'thulu that ended with disastrous results!)

Ok, here we go.  First on the List. Wampyres! ..er I mean Vampires.

Ah, vampires!  Not the kind that are Virus driven ships, but the Vampires of
Ancient Terran, Vilani, Zhodani, Darrien...hmm, seems that most Alien
cultures have Vampire legends in there somewhere.  Anyway, Vampires.

Here\'s the curent theory.  Vamprism is caused by a symbiotic lifeform(oh
those little life-forms!) This lifeform is also known as Vampiric Blood, or
Dead Blood.  The symbiot is hemovorous, meaning it subsists off of what boys
and girls? (there willbe a test later!)  Yes little Johny! thats right!
Blood!  It don\'t care if your human, vargr, aslan or whatever. All blood is
good blood!

Now in return for feeding this little lifeform, it gives you pretty darn
near eternal life.  These little lifeforms need a host, and as the symbiots
live longer than humans(Yes even longer than Vilani on anagathics!) it keeps
the host alive, how it does this is not rightly known.

You must contine to feed the lifeforms, if you go without blood,  the
symbiot takes over and trys to find the nearest blood it can find, this is
also known as the Frenzie!

That\'s the basics, now here come the game mechanics

Vampires have what are known as "Blood Points".  The initial maximum number
of Blood points is equal to the vampires CON. This blood pool maximum can be
increased through experience points used in the normal fashion.  (7 points
to raise to 7, 8 points to raise to 8, etc...).

How are Blood points used, they are used for psionic effects.  All Vampires
get the ability of Self(Regeneration).  Now heres the scary part.  Use of
Bloodpoints allow the automatic success of any Psionic talent at the same
level the Bloodpoints are used.  For Example, If a Vamp was delt a serious
wound, he could use his Blood points to reduce that down to a scratch wound.
(3 Blood points= Level 3 effect)

To Get Bloodpoints back: Drink Blood!
The Vampire has the option of drinking a lifeform "dry" and therefore
getting bloodpoints equal to the lifeforms CON, or to only drink a little,
geting a portion of the total BP.  For animals, it\'s GM\'s Judgement. Small
1bp, medium 4bp, etc...

Powers:
The Self Psionics cluster is the only cluster in which Blood points can be
used, other Psionics must be learned in the normal fashion. You might want
to record on character sheets as Self-Vampiric.
This allows the Vampire to use bloodpoints in the following:
Regeneration
Suspended Animation
Orientation
Psi-Enhaced STR
Psi-Enhanced CON

Also, as long as you have the bloodpoints, you might as well ignore the
ageing effects chart. You stay as young (or old) as you were when you were
"Changed". This main effect of the symbiots eats 1bp per day.


Limitations:
As stated before, UV light affects the Symbiots adversely, damage is doubled
to the Host if hit with a UV laser, direct UV like from a star, WILL KILL THEM!

Energy attacks or fire will do Agrivated Dammage, dammage which cannot be
healed using the Self-Vampiric ability.  This is because some of the
symbiots have died off in the wounded area.

The vampiric symbiots will reject any type of food that is not blood, that
is you can\'t digest or even tolerate real food.  With experience points
Vamps can learn "Tolerate Food" skill which has CON as the controlling
atribute. Use of the skill is Difficult.

A stake through the heart will IMMOBILIZE a Vampire, due to the nature of
the symbiots, they must be in continous flow throughout the body, stop the
heart, and you stop the flow.

Vampires can exist in a vacuum for a time, up to CON x Miniutes, after that
they go into a state of Suspended animation called Torpor. This also happens
when the Vamp runns out of Bloodpoints and cannot find a fresh source of
Blood in 24 hours. Basicaly the symbiots shut down, but don\'t die!

Also, When 0 Bloodpoints are reached a vampire must make a Difficult
Willpower check or go into a bezerk frenzie untill he can feed.

Well, that\'s about that for playing Vamps in Traveller.
I caution GM\'s out there to only use this for NPC Villians, unless you are
ready to handel PC vampires.  They can be powerful. Especialy if they are
allowed to live a while.  Even so, Vampires in Traveller should be RARE!
They are just something for the GM to use once in a blue moon, for a horror
adventure.  But if you like the idea of a "TRULY Dark Traveller", hey It\'s
your campain.

As I have said many times before on my "Tales":
Feel free to spindle, maime, mutilate, chop, hack, or whatever you wanna do
to these rules SUGGESTIONS.  I won\'t mind, realy.
Also...
These Tales are fictious. Any similarities to persons both living and/or
Undead are purly coincidental.

Enjoy!

That was all the information I listed as giving--actually just the size

Sorry, yes they are.  And they go with my previously posted sensor
rules.

BTW, the automatic bogey on a jump flash implies that the sensor is
looking in the right direction.  I\'ll have to figure out what the
chances are of that.  (what the scan area must be)

That leads to an interesting sensor rule addition----scan vs. lock-on
mode.  These would be physics limited.  Wide vs. narrow field.  If you
are using a given sensor to lock on a target, you can\'t scan very well
with it.  A good reason for ladars, etc to hand off to.  A scanning
sensor should be penalized if doing a lock-on, etc..

Hi,

One thing that has bugged me for a while is the way TNE sandcasters
work.  I thought about it for a while and decided they\'re not so bad...
but I have a few suggestions on how to make the rules feel better.

I think that a given sandcaster should work against all shots from a
given shooter in a turn (in the case of missiles, all missiles that come
through a given hexside are the "shooter" in this case).\\

The rationale is that the enemy is a point source basically, and if you
have a blob of sand in the way of his laser, it\'s still in the way for a
laser a couple meters over and to the left.

A quick and dirty way to simulate this is to do the following:

1.  All lasers and PAWs fired from one ship during a turn may be reduced
by a given sandcaster.

2.  Missiles in a swarm are considered as one attacker (as are all
missiles coming through the same hexside.

3.  Each hit is treated the way they treat outstanding hits----spend a
cannister.  This way they can still be overloaded.

4.  One cannister is expended the first turn the sandcaster is ready to
operate, regardless of if it is actually attacked that turn.

5.  Multiple sandcasters may be used in the same way they can in BL, but
they must be assigned one of two missions:
	a. additive reduction----the reduction only happens after the
beam has passed through previous sandcaster attacks.
	b. gap filling----the sandcaster attacks beams after the previous
sandcasters run out of cannisters during this attack.

eg.:  A ship has 3 sandcasters, and is attacked by lasers.  The primary
sandcaster is backed up in this attack by the secondary in a gap filling
mode, and the third is used for additive reduction (forming an inner
shell of protection).  10 700MJ lasers hit.  The primary sandcaster hits
3, absorbing all but one totally, but in doing so uses its last
cannister.  The remaining energy is successfully hit by the third sandcaster 
and blocked.  Of the untouched beams, 4 more are reduced by the third 
sandcaster, 3 hitting the ship at full force.  The second sandcaster
used a cannister to restore the outer layer, but since it was the last
laser hit rolled for that was blocked, there was no opportunity for it to
block any attacks this turn.  A total of 9 cannisters have been used.

Better ideas?  Any ideas for damper screens (not turrets, but works
against all attacks type screens (as promised (for FFS??) in BL).

Howdy,

I\'m told I have an old copy of BL (how do you tell?), so chech this.

The Zhdits claims to have 1400kl of jump fuel for jump 2.  It is a
5600kl ship (400 tons).  The jump fuel should be 840, and the gturns are
fewer then as well (the total value including gturns)----I think it it
should be 81.6 instead of 104.  They seem to have calculated* the fuel
based on a jump 4 drive.  The errata I got with my BL has nothing on the
Zhdits.  It is off by 40tons (560kl (some 22.4 gturns)).  I was planning
on redoing it with my standard 4ton Zho turrets, and ran the whole
design through the spreadsheet.  It will look like a real ship when I\'m
done :-)

*I\'m surprised that they didn\'t use a spreadsheet to do the design...
actually, the difference they came up with is hard to do, it is a major
change in the plug and chug even if you\'re doing it by hand (as I used
to do).

So, stay tuned for a decent Zhdits.  I\'m using the same number of
staerooms because I assume that they used the number on the deck plans
from FASA (which I don\'t have).

This is no longer a tight design at all.  I may add an MFD (I already
added redundant sensors).

PS-I assume this *must* have been fixed in later versions----please let
me know I should eat crow! :-)

Subj:	THe Secret J-6 Route


The idea was that the common civil network was J-4 (XBoats) and J-2 (Type S).
The Secret J-6 route was designed to look exactly like J-4 Imperiallines
Cargo ships, so that their travel would be unnoticed. Unless, of course,
you get a good neutrino sensor fix on it as it preps for jump... which is a
little late to stop it.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I can see the J-6 \'shortcut\' across the void being secret but I still
wonder why they felt the need to disguise some of the couriers while
all those standard J-6 ImpNavy couriers were openly cruising around.
===================================================================

As for "Dark Traveller" -- The virus is very dangerous, and far more common
on the tables, than the text implies. In sending a group out from the RC,
they encountered Vampyre Ships 2 of 3 jumps. They died freeing a world from
the virus. Every player group I have GM\'d or talked with about their TNE
experiences compares it to Vampire: the Masquerade. Vampire is about angst;
TNE just causes angst. And RSB includes Anagathic B, which is another
"dark" touch. By no means is the New Era the sweetness and light GDW wants
people to think it is.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Yeah, no doubt that the TNE setting is \'Dark Trav\'. I think GDW was playing
to the current fad for that sort of thing.
==========================================

What I\'ve been waiting for for almost a decade now is a major consolidation
of what is out, for whatever the current rules system is. TNE is the best
Rules... but the CT background won the Literature Awards....

Game resources. In fact, a whole new product line. LOTS of things have
changed (including some of the underlying assumptions of \'Traveller

Anyone want to take bets on Drake\'s reaction to the New Era?

P.S. Drake, be sure to sign up to the X-Boat list, since it formed
for the benefit of those who couldn\'t abide the new system and setting,
and focusses on Classic (original) Traveller and Megatraveller.
If you\'re using MT then it may be the list most directly useful to you.

I assume that the above means that _you_ tried it. Where are
your numbers? Are we all supposed to crank out a bunch of lasers
at various powers and techs by ourselves just to see if you\'re even
on to something? Come on!

[grumpy mode off]

Seriously, posts like that aren\'t particularly useful for most
of us. How do existing published designs stack up? What effects
(if any) does tech level have? Tell us what you know!
Give us your numbers!

The point of the 50Mj*TL rule was to impose some sort of limit on
lasers that would keep them at the bottom of the ship-weapons
heirarchy (where GDW seems to have just assumed everyone
would build them, not even considering the effects of large ones)
without neccesitating ANY change in existing, published designs
(so as to improve chances that GDW might actually adopt it
as an official rule -- above and beyond the fact that unlimited lasers
make PAWs and MGs obsolete [and thus, ship combat less varied])

What effects does your 250 rule have? Be more specific.

 Wrong, that\'s an error. It SHOULD say that. Remember, the effective
range is the region where all of the PV can be applied (R less than or
equal to 1). Outside the effective range (R > 1) is where the beam loses
cohesion thanks to focussing limits, and thus it doesn\'t hit with full
strength.

I made the same mistake the first time I ran through the sequence.
I was designing a PAW to fit an Azhanti High Lightning-sized
ship, and came up with the something\'s-wrong-here result of
thirty-seven THOUSAND PV at short range.
Can you say "Fire the Wave Motion Gun!"? Ouch!

100,000 and bigger. The largest ever published (Tigress-class
in the blackbook Fighting Ships) was half a million, and 300K
was common for smaller models.

In present-day usage (at least in the USA), the word "cruiser"
cam refer to certain categories of naval vessels, as well as
certain police vehicles (namely, cars). There seems to have 
been some sort of dichotomy of usage in the Imperium as well.

Naval cruisers ranged between 10,000 and 100,000 tons, though
the low end of that might instead be labelled a "destroyer".

Other "cruisers", be they colonial-, mercenary-, or whatever, tended
to be called cruisers because the people who built them called them
that.

This may be confusing, but it seems the Imperium let it stand since
it aided obfuscation by the Imperium ("We\'ve sent a cruiser to deal with
that problem") and because it complicated enemy intelligence gathering
("Agent Slartibartfastishav relayed a report of six cruisers in the system."
"Was he more specific? Did he mean cruisers, or CRUISERS?")

    'body' => '
 Now, ever since I bought FF&S, the thing that has bugged me the most(No, 
not gmax X 10 :) is the fact that explosives just stop developing at TL-10.
 So, to fix this, I\'ve come up with additional explosives.
 Beginning at TL-10(Chemicial Plasma Cartridge), the EPGs can be used in 
place of explosives, calculating their damage the same way you would for 
a plasma or fusion beam.
 The reason why I like this is because it actualley gives tac-missiles 
some teeth, whereas before, the only way to go was direct-fire weapons.
 This would not interfear with the background or the RC equipment, since, 
until your TL14-16, they are to expensive to be of use.

 The way you would desing one is look on the warhead chart and find the 
given mass of a warhead, then divide it by 1000 to get it\'s mass on tons, 
then divide it by 4, and then divide it by the listed EPG Volume. Hence, 
a 150mm Warhead would be equivilient to a 125mj fusion beam when it impacted.
 The only diffrince between these and a fusion beam is that the EPG is 
scatterd upon detonation, and the beam has a very short range. Hence, 
it\'s penetration would only apply to targets it actualley struck.
 Now, these weapons become on par with "conventional" explosives at 
TL-16, other then that, they would only be used for missions were money 
is secondary. So, if your in the RC, they might be issued to special 
teams, or PCs. If your in the Regency, then they would be special forces 
weapons, since they can manfuacture TL-16 weapons, but on a limited quantity.
 How you want to handel avaibility of these weapons is up to you(the GM), 
but in any campaign I run, they\'ll be just as avaible as EPGs of the 
appropiate TL. Since there really isn\'t any diffrince(According to the 
High Energy weapons rules).
 Another variation on this might be reduce the pen to the appropiate for 
a HE round, but double Concussion, and quad Burst. This would be a area 
of effect high-energy explosive.

 I\'ll post a buncha designs tomorrorw or in a few(days), as I\'m not 
really upto it right now. But they\'re not to hard to design(quite easy in 
fact, just take a given TAC missile, and replace the warhead)
 If GDW is still out there, I would love to hear their opinions on this 
topic.

Don\'t let them scare you, man.  Traveller: The New Era (commonly known as 
TNE) is the best thing that ever happened to Traveller.

Well, looking at CT and MT Sources, Cruisers seem to be in the 30-150 KTon
range, DN\'s 200-500 KT, and BB\'s 500-1000 KT. Escorts appear to be under
2000 tons, leaving a huge gap. Destroyers seem to be up to about 40 KT.

Sources include: (CT) _Supplement_9:_Fighting_Ships_ and (MT)
_Fighting_Ships_of_the_Shattered_Imperium_. Both by GDW.

        I\'d argue for exit sigs vary with jump number: since different jump
numbers require different energies to enter, the "spillover" radiation from
jumpspace as you exit would also be different -- at jump six, you\'re coming
down a much steeper slope than at jump one. So you can tell how big a mass
came through, and roughly how far it came. Or better yet, the energy is a
function of both mass and jump number, with no easy way to separate the
effects. So maybe that\'s a small ship from far away, or a big ship from next
door ...

So, although I know that all the "old hands" on both of these lists
have each and every article from Challenge memorized, I was wondering if
anyone has put together a complete list of all the Trav books, supplements,
products, etc? For instance, did "Flashback" (stock #0217) ever come out?
It has an ISBN number in the ad for it in the back of COACC, but I\'ve
never heard _anything_ about it...

If not, I could start work on compiling such a list (it wouldn\'t be too
much work really) and could even put up web space if no one else has
any...

Howdy,

I\'ve had the chance to play a few more BL games lately (I had been doing
more BR) and I kept some notes.  I\'ve been using the concept that going
active, or using gturns both cause automatic bogey detections.  There is
a not so subtle effect of this I thought I\'d mention (I didn\'t put it in
the last draft of my sensor rules posted).

If a ship is detected as a bogey, the _only_ way for the _Bogey
Detection_ to be lost is for the target not to use gturns or be active.
The latter is easy, but if it doesn\'t use gturns, don\'t bother treating
it as invisible----it is on the last known vector, it\'s as good as still
being a "real" bogey effectively.

Just thought I\'d make that obvious for the sake of simplifying
bookkeeping.  It also means that if you saw a HEPlaR plume at some great
distance you\'d know more or less where they are, and they\'ll know you\'re
coming as well----I like that this is the standard case in the straight
BL rules (I don\'t mind the rules, I just like having a reason *why*
something works the way it does).

>From a roleplaying POV, something a crew might do, knowing that they use
of HEPlaR makes their position know to anyone that cares is the
following:

Use terrain to do a burn that can\'t be seen... a good use for planets,
do a burn to put your course behind a terrain feature (asteroid, even),
then do a course change when you\'re out of line-of-sight.

Assuming the shape of the HEPlaR cloud isn\'t usually imaged all that

Maybe there\'d be a way to fake a HEPlaR plume :-/  Rig up the lifeboat
or Gig to blow all its propellant in a big puff at the same time the ship
does a small burn.  By the time the other guy analyzes the HEPlaR cloud
at high resolution you\'ve made it to jump point...  

Anyhow, this makes Bogeys less ephemeral than they might have seen in my
rules (it was there, I just didn\'t point it out).

-Merrick

PS-  I used some 21g135 HEPlaR missiles last few games.  Interesting.  I
was trying out S/FIMs and they were pretty hard to use (I was using them
with fighters) since getting locks was bloody hard----even when trying to
paint the target with an active.  Allowing passives to use twice an
active sensors short range (the active is broadcasting from the target)
makes using passives very effective... evade a little and you\'re in good
shape.  I\'ve been giving this bonus only iff the active has a lock on,
otherwise it\'s just the -1 DM (since if there\'s a lock on the active
will dwell on, or at least frequently return to, the target).

I\'ll have all my revisions added to the rules I wrote in a week or so.

Ah.  Now comes the question of signal strength.  MT (or TNE, for that
matter) limits the 
range at which a given detector can detect an object.  Consider that the
signal strength must be
strong enough to be picked out from the general interstellar background
noise as a sophont-made
signal.  The only detectable signal is that being bounced back in a direct
line (curved slightly by the gravity of intervening bodies) between source
and detector. 

(worth noting in the other discussion about ship size detectability; on a
curved hull, the only difference in detectability in a
small hull and a large hull is length; and if the curve of the hull is in
three dimensions (like a sphere) the return surface for any ship at long
range is a point.  Once you start dealing in 
slab sides or shapes encompassing reverse curves, you get more return,
although you still
don\'t get much bounceback along a signle ray)

Detecting a ship return as opposed to a return off any random piece of space
junk, gas cloud, or background cosmic ray is most difficult; You really only
get positive results from a series of definitive returns (return can also be
passively gathered data; in any case it is a signal that hits the detector
array).  Picking a ship out of the backgound at 100 AU is just not available
in MT or TNE (CT avoid the issue, near as I recall).

The other option, of course, is to seed your comet belt with detectors.
THOUSANDS of detectors
with commo links back to the home planet.  These, of course will all need to
be periodically serviced (long haul rides) or replaced as they go off-line
(may actually be cheaper than servicing).

>10% of the sky continuously using only present day technology (radio

Recall that SETI is based on the assumption that messages will be
identifiable as messages due to regularity of the signal (even if only
on/off with regularity).  Deepspace detection of objects does
not have that advantage.  I can spin my vessel perpendicular to the line
between me and the planet, and I will appear as a random object.

However, note also that detecting a comet for refueling ( and most will be
more like 100s of meters rather than kilometers) is a lot easier than
matching vectors and grabbing it for fuel!  That is a chase than can take
days...

MT and TNE both tell us that the technology is not there (in sensor ranges)

IR light is a weak source, certainly at the ranges >1 AU.

Note that the Oort cloud is HUGE (Space is really, really big!).  The
ability to detect all its items is not available for any reasonable cost.
Star Wars (the space-based defense vs ICBMs) was and inetresting idea, too,
but among its other flaws it was TOO EXPENSIVE to implement. And
it wasn\'t.  So would be putting detectors throughout the Oort Cloud of a
system (much less
every one in imperial space).

Note that this is also a vector I described as completely viable for Vampire
vessels - jump into the Oort cloud, fall out toward the inner system in a
direction so as to not threaten the planet directly and then bombard the
planet with radio messages containing copies of itself.  Combined
with jumping past any blockade using the dark between the stars, there is no
defense. So, there
should be no Regency, either.  But that, little Adam, is another story.

I second Scott\'s statement.  TNE is far different from Classic Trav and 
MegaTrav, but in most ways it\'s a much-improved game.  Life isn\'t static 
and neither should our RPGs be.  Where\'s the story in a universe that never 
changes?

If I have one complaint about TNE, it\'s that the proofreading has seemingly 
gone out the window in several of the early products.  They seem to have 
gotten a reign on quality control for the most part, though, with later 
products.

What I\'m looking forward to is a "Year 2000 Sourcebook."  What\'s gonna 
happen 800 years after the fall of Virus.  I\'d like to see TNE reach this 
point some day.

there any type of limitation on size (other than power/thrust

those limitations.

large guns, as big as a battleship: these were battlecruisers.  The theory
was that by shooting first and more accurately they could hold off a
battleship long enough to escape.  It sorta worked, when used according to
doctrine.

When designing ships for TNE, I would reserve the term \'cruiser\' for a ship
that can spend extended periods away from support ships.  This is tricky to
do with jumps, but you can trade off mass for maneuver burns and agility, and
come close.

I had no doubt that you could get the numbers to work out... too bad
they don\'t match the stated design.  I wonder what the mass difference
is between the two.  Also, what is the stated length of the ship(s) it
is mounted on.  Does either the 14m or 15.35m design fit as L or .8*L?

If you are designing plug in weapons, just do them.  The ship designer
will pick the size that fits.  If you want them to be standard to the
MIL, then they\'d have to fit the volume (and presumably length)
requirements of the module.  Mass wouldn\'t be important for you as the
plug-in designer... but it would be smart to look at the mass of the
MIL and make sure that with your module the total mass would be within
15*hull_displacement so the craft wouldn\'t suffer from carrying it
(although it might be worth the trade if the weapon was nasty enough).

I\'d be interested if anyone thinks a PAW with a damage value (or PV, or
whatever it is :-) of 70 (max) could ever "rapidly inflict killing
damage" (my paraphrase, probably not a direct quote) on a small
starship.  Even most traders would have armor of 40 or so.  That means
the PAW is as good as a laser only within 5 hexes (and much worse when
you consider the excess damage will never be able to repenetrate the
armor), and will only warm the hull at greater ranges.  Military ships
are gonna be armor 60 (62, frequently for some reason), so it\'ll be lame
even at under 5 hexes.  It\'s bad when the coaxial fusion gun with a
1.something km short range is a much better weapon than your primary gun
:-)

I bet that a real varmit gun (a .22 or SKS) would do more damage by
orders of magnitude than that PAW at BL type closing velocities.

They should have made them open frame designs at whatever tonnage would
allow a length of 25m (for a damage of 125).  They could get the volume
down by having a short range if needed, but at least it would penetrate
hulls with enough energy left over to do criticals to a small military
ship.  Then they could use the illustration on the MT Fighting Ships for
a picture of what it looks like (hmmm).

Were the PAWs craft in question at TL15?  Maybe I\'ll try to make useful
versions with said 25ish meter PAW.

Hmmm.  Maybe the flash is only dependent on the volume (area of jump
grid or whatever), but the quality of the flash changes with j-number...

I might actually change with the jump number of the drive, not the
actual distance traveled.  That would be dealt with in the rules by
allowing an outstanding success to detect the telltail particles formed,
or the typical spectrum of, a given jump number drive.

Sensor Officer:  "Captain, our high freq. EMS just picked up a jump flash, the
emission spectrum is consistent with a Zhodani jump 4 drive, and the
high energy particle detector array confirms this interpretation... a HEPlaR
exhaust plume was detected 15 seconds later, so we assume this is an
entry signature."

Captain: "Engineering, prepare to run on minimal power.  Maneuver, how
long ago was our last course correction?  Will they see our last burn,
or has it gone by them already?  Weapons----charge the HPGs before we go
to powered down mode."

Maneuver:  "Captain, our last scheduled course change was completed on
time 13 minutes ago.  The jump flash was made some 10 light minutes from
our position at the time of burn."

XO:  "The plume should be warm enough to radiate detectably long enough
for them to have a chance of detecting it... it\'ll depend on if they
look this way at the beginning of their sweep."

Captain:  "Damn!  Power down anyway, and prepare to get the plant up to
speed if they show any sign that they\'ve seen us."

Sorry, I got carried away...

   Hmm... now there\'s an interesting thought....what will Known Space
be like in the Imperial year 2000?

HEADLINES

----The Terran Empire denies any knowledge of a raid conducted last
week on the Imperial world of Aubaine.  Aubaine, an important frontier
world, suffered severe damage to its starport and naval base facilities.
A Terran spokesman laid the blame squarely on the neighboring Ithklur
Empire ``which as we know has been rather aggressive since
absorbing the last of the Hiver Federation.``

----Imperial spokesman have denied rumors that the Imperial fleet sent
of relieve Zhodane has met unexpected resistance.  ``We have every
confidence that this latest Aslan incursion against our borders will be
turned back, just as previous incursions have been.``  Friction between
the Imperium and the New Aslan Hierate dates back to the pre-Regency
era.  This latest skirmish began late last year when the Aslan attempted
to press claims to regions of space around the former Zhodani
homeworld.

----Imperial scientists have discovered a small colony of K\'Kree on a
world in the Ley Sector.  Thought driven to extinction more than 200
years ago, the discovery of the colony was exciting news to the
researchers.  ``We may now be able to better understand this race
and its habits and perhaps gain some insight as to why they are so
universally hated,`` said a spokesperson for the scientists.

Food for thought,

    'body' => 'Howdy,

here are some notes I jotted down a while ago regarding active vs.
passive sensors.  These may look like a silly thing to write down since
it\'s just a rewrite of the players aid card in a way, but it is useful
(IMHO) to see it in a different format.

I assumed a sensor duel between 2 Small ships.  One with a 16 hex AEMS,
the other with a 8 hex PEMS (folding).  The range is 64 hexes.  The AEMS
ship is free to evade at up to 6gs.  The PEMS ship can\'t evade at all
because it has a folding array.  Both have 16 hex EMS Jammers (not that
it matters for the AEMS ship).  I also assume that using the jammer
counts as going active (not explicit in the rules).  Both ships also
have EM Masking and are at the same TL.  I didn\'t use black globes at
all.

I was trying to get at the range of Diff Levels the sensing ship would
have to deal with.  For the AEMS, for example, jamming to +2 DMs was
impossible because outstanding success is not possible for the
Formidable Jamming task, etc..


AEMS ship Lock-On attempt:

Conditions					Diff Level
----				----
No Jamming by target:				Difficult	

Jamming successful or Cat. Evasion 
Failure by AEMS ship :				Formidable 

Jamming + Cat. Evasion
Failure by AEMS ship:				Impossible



PEMS Lock-On attempt (straight BL):

Conditions                                      Diff Level
----                           ----
Stern quarter* if AEMS is using 
gturns:						Easy

Evasion +1 and stern quarter:			Average

Evasion +2 and stern quarter:			Difficult

"Normal" or Evasion +3 and
Stern quarter:					Formidable

Evasion +1 or no gs:				Impossible

Evasion +2+					No attempt


*Stern quarter----this is the drive signature rule from BL.  In my
edition the rules say stern quarter arc, but the aid card says stern
on... a big difference, and I don\'t have any way of knowing if it was
made clear.

Of the possibilities I think the last 3 are most likely.  The Difficult
result seems impossible given that an Outstanding success on the evasion
task would let you choose facing.

PEMS Lock-On attempt (using my sensor rules):
(if the diff level above is easier, it may be used instead)

Conditions                                      Diff Level
----                           ----
"Base"----AEMS ship has a lock:			Average

Target Evasion +1:				Difficult

Target Evasion +2:				Formidable

Target Evasion +3:				Impossible


This case allows the PEMS to operate at twice the short range of the
AEMS----so 64 hexes is Medium range.  This range may only be used if the
AEMS has a Lock-On, otherwise use the normal rules.

The major difference is that except for cases where the PEMS happens to
get a shot into the HEPlaR drive of the target, it will always be less
likely to lock with than the AEMS.  Also, using my passive rules the
diff levels directly above would be the same for *any* passive sensor!
(I require that the antenna be at least the same size as the active\'s
though)

It is interesting to note that in the latter PEMS case the ship could
have a non-folding array and be able to evade----it would then be at a
great advantage over the AEMS ship.

We\'ve been horsing around with these rules along with the new HEPlaR
missiles and we get very passive battles.  I was trying to paint a
Gazelle with the 10 hex AEMS on a Rampart (until that point the Rampart
had no Lock) and actually locked.  Next turn the Gazelle would\'ve taken
a few missiles, but it killed the Rampart as soon as it went active with
the 2 LBs... 3 hits----6 criticals **boom**    (I let the Gazelle use its
folding 5hex array as a 4 hex array when folded, so it could use
passives and evade)

Missiles are still hard as hell to lock... the sub-shortrange idea
posted here works pretty well.  At detonation range (0) missiles become
Easy to lock with a SR10 AEMS.  Otherwise missiles are impossible to
lock.

Anyway, that\'s how typical military sensors stack up.

As soon as I get a few more shipments to round out my rebuilt collection,
I\'ll start working on the list again. I intend on including things like
publishers stock numbers as well as (when they are used) ISBN numbers.

There will be some gaps in the listing: For example, I was not interested in
Group One and Judges Guild products when I last actively ran Traveller. I
don\'t think I\'ll buy them now at today\'s inflated collectors prices! So, I\'ll
need some help filling in the gaps. Magazine articles will be another area of

early Dragon articles, White Dwarf articles, etc. So, again, if folks can

Near the Regency\'s extreme spinward tip lies Jewell, capital of the Jewell
subsector and for centuries the first line of defense against incursions by
the Zhodani Consulate.  While relations with the Zhodani have improved
greatly in recent decades, Jewell still resembles nothing so much as a
massive military encampment.  Almost six centuries of living on the \'front
lines\' has given the inhabitants of Jewell a unique, if somewhat grim outlook.

Jewell was settled in the early 300\'s by colonists fleeing from the Lishun
and Vland Sectors.  The colonists, of mixed Solomani-Vilani heritage,
initially settled on Palique (0609 / Mora), before religious tensions forced
them to more on to Jewell.  The original colony grew slowly, hampered
largely by respiratory problems caused by volcanic outgassing.  The
discovery of unusually rich lanthanum deposits on the planet\'s eastern
hemisphere sparked a huge influx of immigrants and business investment.
Jewell also became the jumping-off point for further settlement in the
Chronor subsector, and beyond the Spinward Marches in the Foreven Sector.

With increasing industrialisation, and a growing realisation of the
potential Zhodani threat to spinward saw the Imperial government begin to
take an interest in Jewell.  A naval presence was established in the system,
followed by the establishment of a Navy and Scout base from 480-485.  A
century later, ships from the Jewell Squadron were the backbone of Imperial
forces that jockeyed for position with the Zhodani in the Chronor and
Massina (subsec D/Foreven) subsectors.  This jockeying soon erupted into
open warfare as the First Frontier War exploded through the Marches.

Jewell was captured by Zhodani forces in 592, and occupied until Olav
hault-Plankwell retook the system amid fierce fighting in 603.  The end of
the war saw the Zhodani in possession of former Imperial worlds in the
Foreven Sector, and Jewell became a major factor in the Imperium\'s plans to
defend the Spinward Marches from further attack.  Predictably enough, Jewell
was attacked heavily during the Second Frontier War (615-620), and was under
seige for almost eight months before Admiral Arbellatra Akhalikhoi relieved
the world in 617.  After the war, with most of the Chronor Subsector in
Zhodani hands, Jewell became even more important to the Imperial Navy.
Facilities were expanded, and the naval presence in the system scaled up.

Industrialisation of Jewell continued, at a predictable cost to the
planetary biosphere. Jewell\'s population mushroomed, due to the arrival of
refugees from former imperial worlds, and fortune-seekers looking for
employment.  Jewell was attacked heavily in each of the subsequent Frontier
Wars, and suffered grievously, although it remained in Imperial hands.  The
system was heavily beseiged by Zhodani forces during the Fifth Frontier War
- from the war\'s outbreak in 1107 to the breakout of the 125th Fleet in
1110, Jewell was largely cut off from outside aid.  The breakout of the
125th was accompanied by supporting attacks by Imperial naval assets from
the Regina subsector, and effectively ended the seige (although the Zhodani
remained a menace in the system for some time to come).  By the
assassination of Emperor Strephon in 1116, Jewell was one of the most
heavily defended systems in the Marches, as well as being a heavily
industrialised world and home to 6 billion souls.  In 1202, Jewell is home
to 11.2 billion.

Jewell was one of the 26 worlds targetted by the Regency Industrial
Development Program. The program was highly successful on Jewell, and has
succeeded in raising the world\'s tech level to 15 (F).  The massive
investment in Jewell paid handsome dividends.  This was fortunate, as Jewell
is one of the primary target worlds for refugees fleeing the \'troubles\' in
the Zhodani Consulate.  There are currently almost one hundred million
Zhodani refugees on Jewell, held in over one thousand holding camps,
primarily in the north polar regions of the planet.  Despite the efforts of
the Regency and the Jewell government, more refugees are arriving in greater
numbers than can be processed and resettled.  The refugees\' presence is not
well tolerated by the locals, which is the major reason why the holding
camps are located well away from settled areas.

On entering the Jewell system, be prepared to be immediately challenged by
Regency Navy or Regency Quarantine Service ships.  Incoming starships will
be directed to the RQS Station on Opal (Jewell\'s outermost satellite,
F10026B-C), where the ship and it\'s occupants will undergo exhaustive
examination.  Ships that do not pass inspection will be impounded
immediately, and it\'s owners/operators can look forward to a lengthy sojourn
at the Regency Prison on Jenghe/Regina.  Whatever the result, expect to be
held on Opal for at least three days.

Following quarantine procedures, permission will be granted to transfer to
one of Jewell\'s three commercial starports:  Jewell Highport, Jewell
Downport or Magdala Commercial Starport (a privately owned facility).  All
other starport facilities in the system are operated by the Regency Navy
and/or Quarantine Service, and are strictly off limits to unauthorised
personnel.  Still, one can\'t help but notice the presence of warships -
Jewell is swarming with activity, from 10-ton boats shuttling to and fro to
the BatRon of Plankwell Class Battleships home-ported at the Arbellatra
Akhalikhoi Naval Base.  Jewell is the headquarters of the Regency 212th Fleet.

Descending to the surface, one of the more noticable sights are the banks of
dirty brown clouds covering a rocky gray surface.  Sprawling cities and
industrial complexes mark much of the planet\'s surface, and a large fraction
of it\'s land area.  Jewell, despite it\'s name, is a dirty and grimy world.
The atmosphere is fouled by a host of pollutants, chiefly sulphur dioxide,
hydrogen sulphide and nitrogen compounds.  Breathing the atmosphere without
a filter mask is not advisable - a few hours exposure is generally
acceptable, but further exposure inevitably results in respiratory disorders
and cancers.  Filter masks are provided free of charge by the government,
and are dispensed at all public places.  On arrival at the planet\'s surface,
visitors will be issued with a temporary permit for a nominal fee.

Jewell\'s cities tend to look alike - dirty and drab are the words most used
by offworlders to describe them.  Little attention is paid to building
exteriors, beyond that necessary to keep the atmospheric taints outside.
Combine this with the gray coveralls that seem to be a regulation item of
clothing amongst the locals, and the filter masks that cover the face and
eyes, and a visitor could well be tempted to make a hasty departure for more
inviting locations.  Perserverance is advised however, for like most surface
appearances, those on Jewell are deceiving.

Jewell\'s natives are friendly and accomadating towards off-worlders, with
the notable exception of Zhodani and Vargr (both races are the target of
centuries old fear and loathing).  Unfortunately, the Zhodani Exodus has
dumped millions of Zhodani literally on Jewell\'s doorstep.  Their presence
on the Jewell is the cause of great dissatisfaction, with many demanding
that the refugees be sent at gunpoint back to the Consulate.  

Once indoors, with coveralls and facemasks off, Jewellers are an expansive
and demonstrative lot and are famous drinkers, brawlers and poets.  Building
interiors are generally low-ceilinged, and richly decorated, designed to
promote a sense of comfort and well being.  Jewell also has one of the
highest number of bars per capita of any world in the Regency.

Jewell\'s government is a fairly unremarkable impersonal beauracracy, local
Administrative Councils report to successively higher authorities, up to the
Planetary Administrative Authority.  The beauracracy recruits from all
levels of society, and if promotion is not entirely merit based, it is not
so corrupt as to invite popular revolt. Law levels are high, banning
personal weapons outside of the home, and the local law enforcement
authorities are backed by a large and complex legal apparatus.  Trade
regulations are not as harsh, their primary focus being to serve the
requirements of the Regency Quarantine Service.  Jewell\'s government
maintains low tarrifs on most imported goods.  Jewell sends 10
representatives to the Regency Senate, the senators are directly appointed
by the Planetary Administrative Authority, and are typically used as reward
positions for great achievement within the bureaucracy.

The most important non-governmental body on Jewell is the \'Aran Kalje\', a
fiercely atheistic organisation that promotes the virtues of physical and
mental discipline.  The Aran maintains camps, or \'laager\' where adherents
live for up to twenty months at a time under military-type conditions.  Not
surprisingly, a large number of Aran members end up in Jewell\'s armed
forces.  The laager are organised and run at a local level, as is the rest
of the organisation.

Jewell\'s close relationship with the Imperial/Regency military is also worth
noting.  Large tracts of the planet are used by the Army, Navy and
Quarantine Service, and are off limits to civillians.  The planetary
governor is also commander of the planetary armed forces, as well as the
Jewell Colonial Squadrons (the reserve component of the Regency Fleet in
Jewell).  The governor carries the title of Count Jewell, and reports to the
Duke of Regina.  Traditionally, the planetary governor has been an Imperial
or Regency Navy Admiral, one of the rare instances when domestic matters are
overridden by Imperial or Regency authorities.  The title is one of the
relatively few that has survived Norris\' democratic reforms, primarily
because it is not a heriditary title.  

Jewell is a major producer of lanthanum and other rare earth elements
(notably niobium and yttrium ores), as well as fissionable ores.  Not
surprisingly, the planet is also a substantial weapons producer,
particularly small arms and armoured vehicles.  Jewell is also one of the
principal producers of military starships for the Regency.  Perhaps the most
famous product of Jewell is whisky, which is famed throughout the Regency
for it\'s quality.  There are no less than 37 major distilling houses on
Jewell, serving a large domestic and off-world market.  Of these, the most
well known is Amrihkur-Cameron, which has held Imperial patents for it\'s
products since 405.  A bottle of Amrikhur-Cameron malt whiskey bottled in
1107 recently sold for Cr44,000 on Regina.

Ruby is part of the Jewell Cluster, a group of three worlds at the spinward
edge of the Regency.  Dominated by, and reliant on heavily populated Jewell
one parsec away, the citizens of Ruby have managed to preserve independence.
Like Jewell, Ruby\'s location so near to the Zhodani border makes it a
frequent stop for Regency military forces.  However, where centuries of
exposure to the Frontier Wars has given Jewellers an ingrained distrust of
the Zhodani and Vargr, the people of Ruby have an unprejudiced attitude to
all races.

Ruby was first settled in 339, primarily to obtain ores for the inhabitants
of Jewell and Emerald.  Never of great importance, the colony was abandoned
in 362, after large quantities of high-grade lanthanum ores were discovered
on Jewell.  The system remained essentially uninhabited until 634, although
small Zhodani contingents occupied Ruby from 592-603, and in 617.  Both of
these forces withdrew from the system as the balance of the First and Second
Frontier Wars tipped back towards the Imperium.

In 631, Papaieie Sawaiu led a group of leftist libertarians to petition the
Jewell government for permission and aid to settle Ruby.  Jewell\'s
government (which was still legally the owner of the system) granted the
petitions requests (probably more to be rid of a troublesome minority than
anything else), and set aside MCr4.0 to reopen the abandoned colony.  In
634, six hundred Sawaiuites settled a site about 80km southwest of the old
lanthanum mines.  The group began shipping small quantities of platinum to
Emerald in 640, and surprisingly, managed to pay it\'s way.  Sharp falls
precious metal prices in the region in the late 690\'s put an end to the
colony\'s modest prosperity, and Jewell was once again forced to subsidise
it\'s neighbour.

The subsidy was withdrawn in 711, and preparations were made to repatriate
the colonists to Jewell.  The colony, now numbering several thousand, was
saved by the Imperial Government\'s decision to establish scout facilities in
the system.  Tensions between the Imperium and the Zhodani had been
increasing since the end of the Second Frontier War, and the IISS had
decided to upgrade it\'s presence in the subsector as part of a overhaul of
intelligence operations against the Zhodani.  The base and accompanying
starport facilities were completed in 720, many of the existing colonists
were contracted to provide support services for IISS personnel in this
lonely frontier outpost.

The Scout base was hastily abandoned at the outbreak of the Third Frontier
War, it\'s personnel and ships pulled back help defend Jewell from major
Zhodani attacks.  Once again, Zhodani ground troops occupied the world,
taking over the scout base for use in supplying the forces beseiging Jewell.
They pulled out of the system at the end of the war, having largely ignored
the civilian population during their seven year occupation. At the outbreak
of the Fourth Frontier War, Zhodani forces ran into substantial Imperial
naval assets deployed from Jewell.  Their attack was beaten off, and the
Zhodani chose to bypass and isolate the world.  

Ruby was occupied by Zhodani ground forces following a short battle with
Imperial screening forces at the opening of the Fifth Frontier War in 1107.
During the battle, the IMS \'Johore\' was forced down onto Ruby\'s surface.
It\'s surviving crew and marines fled the crash site to begin a guerilla war
against the Zhodani.  In response to raids, the Zhodani commander took
hostages from among the civillian population.  Unfortunately, twelve of the
hostages were killed in an abortive rescue attempt by the guerrila forces.
When news leaked out, the Imperium made it\'s celebrated accusation of
Zhodani atrocities against Ruby\'s civilians.  Perhaps surprisingly, the
Zhodani occupation of Ruby was rather benign - the unfortunate Zhodani
ground forces commander was replaced, and reparations were paid to the
families of the deceased.  A ceasefire was negotiated between the Zhodani
and the guerillas shortly afterwards.  The Imperial Marines were guaranteed
safe passage aboard a neutral vessel to Imperial-held space, were they were
feted as heroes.  Their commander, Lt. Rivka Moishe, was later knighted by
Duke Norris of Regina for her actions.

Since then, Ruby has remained on the \'front lines\'.  Imperial, and later
Regency fleets regularly deployed to the system for exercises.  The thaw in
Regency-Zhodani relations from 1117 onwards saw the scout presence scaled
back, and the scout base was transferred to the Regency Quarantine Service
in 1146.  In the following decade, as trade between the Regency and the
Zhodani Consulate grew, Ruby\'s starport was upgraded to \'A\' class.  The RQS
operates a Customes Station on Ruby, primarily to inspect the small number
of Jump-1 ships travelling along the Jewell-Cipango Main from the Consulate.
Naval units also routinely deploy here from Jewell and Mongo for joint
exercises with RQS and RISS units.

Regular RQS customs procedures are in effect on Ruby.  Incoming starships
will be escorted to the RQS station on Eloise Tay, the small outermost moon
of Boyden, the system\'s only gas giant.  The permanent presence of the RQS
\'Carlton\', a 4000 ton Quarantine Service Carrier, provides the muscle to
back up RQS directives.  Extensive examinations of the starship and it\'s
crew will take 1-3 days (for starships under 1000 tons).  During this time,
crews and passengers are \'invited\' to stay at the \'Eloise Hilton\' (the
somewhat spartan guest accomadations on the station).

Following inspection, the ship is free to move on to Ruby, or to refuel at
Boyden and jump outsystem.  Ruby itself has only one starport, the Class A
RQS facility on the world\'s surface.  This starport is open to civilian
traffic, although berthing fees are considerably higher than for comparable
private facilities.  The base\'s repair and maintenance facilities are not
available to civilians excepts in emergencies (although detatched duty
Scouts and RQS officials are welcome).

New visitors will be steered towards \'Ruby\'s Startown Bar\', on the edge of
the starport complex.  \'Ruby\'s\' is famous throughout the region for it\'s
cheap booze (and other, less common stimulants), and for it\'s bouncers.
Unruly patrons are given a brief lecture on the anit-social aspects of their
violent behaviour by the doormen (a lecture given with absolute sincerity ).
Continued troublemaking will normally result in extremely violent ejection
and arrest.  All staff at \'Ruby\'s\' are members of the Stivlprerqaf family,
descendents of a Zhodani prole who fled across the border in 992.  The
current manager is Jdishehtaev Stivlprerqaf (Jdishehtaev is probably better
known in the Regency as \'Jades Stive\', acclaimed romance novelist).  The
Stivlprerqaf family has persuaded a substantial number of Zhodani refugees
to leave their holding camps on Jewell.  With the blessing of Regency
officials, about 6,000 refugees were brought to Ruby, where they received a
warm welcome from the locals.

Sawaiu Town, the only substantial settlement of Ruby, adjoins the RQS base.
Almost all of Ruby\'s 43,300 permanent inhabitants live here.  The town
itself consists of four pressure domes atop an underground tunnel complex.
The domes are given over largely to parkland - each dome has a different
environment and \'theme\'.  In order of size, these are:  Sawaiu Dome (Terran
/ Tropical Maritime), Isgiidu (Vilani / Highland), Summondamus (Terran /
Desert) and Taenu Diran (Sylean / Savannah).  Residential, commercial and
support areas are all underground.  Local although the world is small, local
gravity is a reasonable 0.78g, due to the planet\'s higher than normal
density.  Atmospheric pressure is maintained at 0.8 standard atmospheres,
making the environment tolerable for most visitors.

Visitors will find the locals friendly and agreeable, if somewhat strange.
Non-violence is an important part of the Rubyan lifestyle, although
potential criminals are warned that Ruby\'s law enforcement officials are
generally hired from offworld, and do not have the same passive ethic.
Offenders face deportation and confiscation of their assets if caught -
within a short time, they will find themselves on Jewell with little more
than the clothes on their back.  Given the world\'s reliance on offworld
powers for it\'s continued existence, foreigners are treated with respect.
Merchants on Ruby will buy and sell for fair prices - at any rate, they are
trading for the good of the colony more than their own gain.  A disgruntled
customer won\'t come back, a potential loss for the world.

Ruby\'s inhabitants are fiercely egalitarian - the concept of \'privelige\' is
repellant to them.  Without exception, all citizens are allocated the same
communal floorspace in Sawaiu Town\'s residential areas.  this concept of
\'equality of opportunity\' is one of the basic tenets of Ruby\'s society - the
lasting legacy of the settlement\'s commune origins.  The settlement\'s ruler,
the \'Premier\', is directly elected by all permanent residents for a two year
term.  Traditionally, the office is one of the lowest paying jobs on the
planet.  Although the Premier is responsible for all aspects of
administration, much of the more judicial and administrative work is handled
by a council of elders.  Membership in the council is voluntary and unpaid,
but anyone over the age of 40 can join.  Ruby\'s four senators are elected by
popular vote.

One interesting custom practised by the Rubyan is \'fostering\'.  Ruby lacks
all but the most elementary educational facilities, children are instead
sent to Jewell to complete their education.  A child will spend from three
to twelve years on Jewell as a \'fosterling\', before returning to Ruby as an
adult citizen.  This practise has recently declined somewhat, as the newly
arrived Zhodani settlers were understandably reluctant to send their
children to Jewell - a world that they had only just left, and a world where
Zhodani are not at all liked.  More advanced educational facilities are
being built by the planetary government to cater to this trend.

Most of Ruby\'s residents are employed either directly or indirectly by the
RQS, although some mining still takes place.  Mineral ores are shipped
mainly to the agricultural worlds of Emerald and Esalin in exchange for
food.  A small number of independant miners eke out a precarious existence
from gold and platinum deposits.  All large scale mining is conducted by
RubyCorp, a statutory authority run by the government.  Miners typically
spend six weeks at a time in the camps, followed by six weeks layover in
Sawaiu Town.  Independent miners number less than two hundred, and typically
live permanently at their workings, coming to town only to sell their ores
and resupply.

Ruby maintains a small fleet of four Type R Subsidised Merchants, used to
service the mineral trade with Emerald and Esalin.  The \'Papaieie\', \'Rhys\',
\'Topaz\' and \'Guiding Hand\' are all subsidised by the Ruby and Regency
governments.

Tw2K included a module called "Merc:2000", an alternative history to
Twilight\'s nuclear war aftermath. In Merc:2000, the world headed for 
economic depression, causing a build-down of most major military forces.
Players are generally mercenaries.  The modules (and the vehicle and
weapons supplements) include Merc:2000 (normal) prices as well as
Twilight:2000 (post-nuke) prices.

On the whole, earth-built TL7/8 weapons are better weapons (lighter;cheaper) 
than the same weapon designed by FF&S by 20-50%. (Buy Solomani-

Actually, you forgot the most important comment from the xboat discussion:
EXIT FLASHES ARE NON-CANONICAL.  They are artifacts from Jerry Pournelle\'s
or CJ Cherryh\'s SF universes (JP:Mote in God\'s Eye, etc; CJC: Merchanter\'s Luck,
the Chanur series, etc; I recommend both highly!).

That having been said, let us consider another few factors:

Why would an entry flash be detectable to a huge distance?  I\'ll admit that
if they exist, they would be quite different from a natural phenomenon, but why
would they have a high signal strength?

>1.  Jump exit sigs are the same regardless of jump number. (yes? no?)

Yes.  The effect at the exit system is a ship breaking back into normal space.  
Why would it be any different based on jump number?

>2.  Jump exit sigs change with displacement of ship (bigger ship, bigger
flash).

Why?  The flash is a point source of the instant of shift in the fabric of
the universe
 as the vessel passes through.

More important is that the flash is only detectable in the direction of the
breakout. 
 If the vessel breaks out in the direction of the planet or some other
detector, they
 could be detected.  Most commercial traffic would try this to fall into the
local 
traffic pattern as soon as possible.  

If a vessel arranged its entry vector to point AWAY from any known detector,
the 
spatial effect sends the flash away from detectors.  This is especially esay
if you 
come in near the edge of a system - but he sure to have enough fuel to turn
your 
vector around!  Pirates and war raiders do this.  

(The defense against this of course is to keep shifting your detectors, but you 
end up dealing with the limited detector range vs the expense required by the 
number of detection vessels issue).


If we take these to be true, then in addition to an automatic B-D, maybe a 
sensor operator might be able to glean other useful information.  This dovetails
with an addition to my sensor rules I\'ve been playing with.


Sensor Rule Additions v0.9

>Bogey-Detections (B-Ds) can be "Outstanding."
If you are close enough - or directly on line of breakout.

>Automatic B-Ds are considered Outstanding.

>Since B-Ds give the range, useful information gleaned from the strength of the 
>received signal. 
Uh, no.  They give direction, and that a breakout occurred.  but that can
tell you 
where to point sensors from three ships (or move your ship and take three
readings); 
subsequent detections will tell you where the target is.  Entry flash alone
will not.

Outstanding B-Ds give the following benefits 
(Active sensor with DF, or passive sensor):

>1.  If the B-D was influenced by the target going active, an outstanding
success
>indicates the short range of the active sensor (that or the MWs used by the 
>sensor).
target going active would tell you signal strength at a given range.  It
tells you 
nothing about the other fellows ability to use a signal of that strength.
You need
to couple it with iother information about the other guy to guess at sensor
range.

>Outstanding B-Ds give the following benefits (Passive sensor):

>1.  If the target used gturns, then the total MW used for thrust that turn are

If the target used Gturns, then scrap the whole piece about detecting exit
flashes. 
If you track Gturns for 30 minutes, you HAVE ship size (drive output energy; 
change in target position relative to yours gives speed; the two together
give you
target ship size (output/change of speed)).

>2.  If the target was detected as a bogey because of a jump exit, then the
size 
>class of the target is known (Small, Medium, Large, Very Large, etc.).
I wouldn\'t. See above.

Emerald is one of five worlds of the Jewell Cluster, straddling the
Regency/Zhodani border in the Jewell Sector.  Fortified for centuries
against the threat of Zhodani invasion, the system is still the site of
considerable military activity, despite improvements in relations with the
Consulate.  Emerald is also an important link between the Regency advance
naval base at Quar (Chronor:  Spinward Marches/0807) and naval forces
operating in the Jewell and Regina subsectors.

Emerald was settled in 308, by the followers of disgraced Sylean nobleman
Aklas Ecannis. Ecannis, the Duke of Ecan (2316/Core), was executed for
cowardice in 306, following the Battle of Concorde during the Aslan Border
Wars.  Stripped of title and privelige, Ecannis\' family was permitted to
emigrate to the Spinward Marches.  By calling in old favours, the newly
widowed Eritrea Ecannis was able to secure a charter to settle Jewell.
About two hundred family and retainers arrived in late 308, and founded the
first settlement at Eritrea.

Although self-sufficient, the colony grew only slowly.  Periodically,
labourers and craftsmen would be recruited from Jewell and Regina, but
settlement remained largely confined to the area around Eritrea.  Although a
part of the Imperium, Emerald remained unrepresented to the imperial court
(by decree in 306, no member of the Ecannis family was permitted to hold
title).  As the imperial presence in the area grew, Emerald began exporting
agricultural products to the rapidly growing Jewell (already emerging as a
major industrial world).

Nonetheless, contact with offworlder remained confined to the small \'E\'
class starport at Masand Caldera, and Emerald remained isolationist.  The
Ecannis family allowed no further settlement, and restricted offworlders to
the starport compound.  This self-imposed isolation was to be stretched to
breaking point as tensions between the Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate
rose, and ultimately shattered by the outbreak of the First Frontier War.

>From 510 onwards, Imperial Navy fleet elements deployed to the Emerald
system from the naval base on Jewell for maneuvers.  The Navy established a
small service facility in the outer system, although craft did occasionally
land on the mainworld. In 540, Grand Admiral Severin Gouden appointed a
legate to the small settlement, mainly to co-ordinate the requisition of
foodstuffs, and keep an eye on the politically suspect natives (as early as
460, Imperial Naval Intelligence suspected Zhodani sympathies in the Ecannis
family).  Emerald\'s starport was also upgraded to \'D\' class, over the
protests of the planet\'s rulers.

With the Zhodani invasion of Imperial space in 591, martial law was declared
on Emerald. Members of the Ecannis family thought to be \'unreliable\' were
interred on Jewell as Imperial forces were pushed back from their original
defensive positions.  The Zhodani attacke and captured Jewell in 592, and
were to remain in possession of the world almost until the war\'s end.
During the Zhodani occupation, the world was used as a prison camp for
partisans captured on Jewell, and the world was forced to endure the
presence of large numbers of Zhodani ground troops.

Following Admiral Plankwell\'s recapture of Jewell in 603, Zhodani forces
evacuated Emerald and fled into Consulate space.  Imperial troops liberated
the world shortly afterwards, but a large garrison was kept in place beyond
the war\'s end.  In 606, the Ecannis family was allowed to return to Emerald.
Limitations on offworlder-native contact remained, but were increasingly
hard to enforce.  This was illustrated by the decision of the Ecannis heir,
Sar Valain Ecannis to apply for the Imperial Naval Academy in 608.  His
decision outraged his relatives, but they were powerless to stop him after
he received the somewhat unexpected support of the Imperial legate.  

Sar Valain went on to distinguish himself in the Second Frontier War, and as
a squadron commander for Admiral (later Empress) Arbellatra Akhalikoi during
the later stages of the Civil War.  Sar Valain returned to Emerald in 626,
as the new Imperial legate, and was instrumental in persuading the Ecannis
family to restrict the most stringent of their isolationist practises.  On
becoming head of the Ecannis family in 630, Empress Arbellatra rescinded the
decrees against the Ecannis family issued by Empress Porphyria in 306, and
Sar Valain was named Baron Emerald.  The office of Imperial legate to
Emerald was dissolved.

Sar Valain\'s descendants concentrated on developing Emerald\'s export
economy.  Large tracts of land were cultivated, using increasingly
sophisticated agrotechnology.  By 900, Emerald was supplying large amounts
of grain to Jewell, despite it\'s small population. The starport facilities
were progressively upgraded to their current capabilities as the Imperial
(and later Regency) Navy increased it\'s presence in the system.  This
pattern has been uninterrupted since, despite occupation by the Zhodani in
the Third and Fifth Frontier Wars.

Emerald\'s highly automated agricultural industry faced upheaval when the
first reports of Virus filtered into the Regency.  The enforced switch from
autonomous to supervised robotics was expensive and damaging to the world\'s
economy - damage which is still felt by many on Emerald.  Production is once
again approaching pre-1130 levels, but further progress is hampered by an
acute labour shortage on this isolationist world.  Emerald\'s leaders,
reluctant to hire offworlders to enlarge their labour pool, took the
unprecedented step of allowing Zhodani refugees to settle.  The decision was
the subject of long and bitter debate, but the first Zhodani were finally
admitted in 1201.  The arrival of nearly thirty thousand Zhodani refugees is
likely to have profound effects on the social structure of Emerald, the
long-term result of these effects will be, to say the least, interesting to
observe.

Only a small proportion of refugees arriving on Emerald are allowed to stay,
the rest are sent on to the holding camps on Jewell.  Those that do stay are
absorbed directly into Emerald\'s rather stratified society.
  
The Ecannis family still rules on Emerald, as the Five Families.  Each of
the Five Families is responsible for an area of activity on Emerald, and is
largely independent of both the other four families and the ruling Head.
The current Five Families are:  Ecannis-Astrakhanna (starport facilities,
energy production), Ecannis-Shtabul (food production and export), Ilike
(mineral production and export), Farsi-Ecannis (construction and
infrastructure) and Ecannis-Valain (communications, information and
administration).  Smaller branches of the Ecannis family control other
activities, normally under the guidance and direction of one of the Five.
Baron Emerald (also known as the Head) comes from the Ecannis-Valain branch,
succession is passed through the male line.

Below the level of the ruling families, rank and position is largely based
on merit.  Particularly powerful, skilled or successful individuals are
often rewarded with marriage or adoption into a Family, giving them
effectively \'noble\' status.  At the bottom of the ladder are the workers,
although given the small population and high technology of the world, even
these are skilled, rather than unskilled workers, and enjoy a good standard
of living.  It is among this class that the labour shortage is most acutely
felt.  The shortage of skilled workers has placed severe constraints on the
Families\' ability to export food and mineral products, but the inherent
isolationism (which can cross the line into xenophobia) of the world makes
solving this problem difficult.  Newly arriving Zhodani refugees are
\'adopted\' into a family and it\'s vassals, depending on their skills.  

When entering the system, travellers will normally find themselves exiting
j-space near Phantome (orbit 1, large gas giant).  A beacon at the regular
jump exit point directs incoming ships to the Regency Quarantine Station on
Mitchell, a smallish moon orbiting Phantome.  Standard quarantine
proceedures will be followed (see the Jewell and Ruby papers for further
details) by Regency Quarantine Service staff before the incoming vessel will
be cleared to travel in-system to Emerald.

Approaching the mainworld, it is quickly apparent that Emerald lives up to
it\'s name.  Much of it\'s land surface is covered in uncleared vegetation,
and it\'s generally shallow seas also have a greenish tinge.  Emerald truly
is an inviting world when viewed from orbit - only it\'s presence near the
Zhodani border prevented further settlement.  Emerald Starport (Masand
Caldara) is a small \'B\' class facility closely tied to the Scout base.  It\'s
small repair facility is not normally available for public use, although
emergency repairs are possible.  Refined fuel is available at the public
facility, but is expensive (Cr 6,500/ton) as are berthing fees (Cr 200/day).

The starport lies some 50 km southeast of Eritrea, the oldest and largest
town with a population of about 14,000.  Travel by air/raft takes about 15
minutes, or about 30 minutes in extreme weather conditions.  There is a road
link to the starport, but it\'s use is mainly confined to freight haulage.
As the passenger approaches Eritrea, he/she will notice the walled compounds
just outside the town\'s edge.  These are private estates belonging to the
Families and their servants, and are off-limits to visitors without an
invitation.  The larger Families maintain a number of compounds, near to
their major concerns.

The commonfolk of Emerald are polite, if somewhat reticent.  Contact and
conversation with offworlders is not encouraged among the general
population.  The Ecannis-Valain family maintains a Liason Centre in Eritrea,
where younger members of this family are on hand to inteface between
visitors and the locals.  The Liason Centre can be found in the Carpaty
Plaza, next to the offices of the Jewell Embassy.

Addendum:  348-1201

Visitors to Emerald are advised to exercise caution when travelling outside
of the starport compound.  Certain conservative elements on the planet are
currently actively campaigning against offworld contact, evoking xenophobic
reactions from portions of the population.  Althought Emerald\'s official
policy is still neutral towards visitors, travellers can expect problems
when dealing with locals, especially those from certain reactionary families
(chiefly Farsi-Ecannis).  Reports of atrocities against newly-arrived
Zhodani refugees are yet to be confirmed.

Hello everyone,

I used to play Traveller donkey\'s years ago, in the age of
what is now called Classic Traveller, when I was the proud
owner of several tatty black books.  I had a long break from
role-playing in general, but I recently got the urge to indulge
again.  I went out to find what was the latest with Traveller and
bought TNE and FF&S.

First impressions?  The rules are a great improvement, and
I think fill in many of the gaps which existed in the original rules,
and which all GMs had to create their own rules for (although
has that taken the fun out of it?) - complete detailed character
generation for all classes being one example.  Also, I think,
probably being a typical Traveller fan, the sight of an ever
more detailed hardware/ship design sequence had me
practically foaming at the mouth with excitement.

However...I\'m not sure about the New Era setting.  I appreciate
GDW moving on and extending the Traveller universe; I just
don\'t know if it\'s what I want to have a campaign in.  Damn it,
call me old-fashioned but I liked the Third Imperium...

Which brings me to my question.  The TNE rulebook gives
some details as to what happened between the Fifth Frontier
War (which is just about where I left things) and the New Era,
ie. the period covered by MegaTraveller, which I gather is
out of print, but not much.  For example, it mentions Lucan
a couple of times, but not who he was, and I\'ve sort of
worked out who Norris was but I\'d like to know more - so,
what I\'m asking is whether anybody knows whether there\'s
any information available through ftp or www which would
be useful for filling in the blanks.  I\'m aware of the archives
at what used to be sunbane and at mpgn, but if anyone
could give me any pointers to any specific files which would
enlighten me I\'d be grateful.

Cheers

D\'Yan, Physical Age 61 in 1201, Calendar age 134

Occupation: Party Animal!

Attributes: STR: 7 INT: 10 SOC: 1
   AGL: 10 EDU: 2 PSI: 11
   CON: 5 CHR: 10

Background: Born sometime in 1067, (her people did not record births, but she
chose 
Holiday as her "official" birthday[1]), in a community of TL 1 Vargr on Pscias
 (2106/Spinward 
Marches). While still a pup, D\'Yan[2] stowed away on a Scout ship that was sur
veying the 
world, and by the time she was discovered, the ship was already in Jump. By th
en, of 
course, it was too late to return her - she had already seen too much to be sa
fely returned to 
a world that knew nothing of aliens or other worlds - and so the crew decided
to adopt her. 
The Scout Service were understandably unhappy about this, but reluctantly agre
ed that 
there was no practical alternative.
As soon as she was old enough, D\'Yan enlisted in the IISS, and soon became an
expert - if slightly eccentric - Scout, preferring long-range exploration and
survey missions, 
(ideally alone). One of the first things she did after joining was to track do
wn the nearest 
Psionics Institution and get herself tested. She was happy to discover that sh
e qualified for a 
scholarship, and went back for training as soon as she had enough leave saved
up. Her 
Psionic powers are probably the main reason that D\'Yan has survived so long -
she has a 
habit of regularly getting herself into life-threatening situations, and being
 able to Teleport to 
safety can be extremely useful!
Her career came to a sudden end in 1110, when her superiors discovered that D\'
Yan 
practised an unusual custom: she enjoyed eating sentient creatures. This was d
iscovered 
when, after an unsuccessful First-Contact mission, her superiors found that sh
e had eaten 
the alien ambassador. Apparently nobody had known that cannibalism was an acce
ptable 
practice on her homeworld, and so had never bothered to tell her not to do it.
 In order to 
avoid a scandal, the IISS simply declared her "psychologically unsuitable for
service", and 
quietly discharged her.
After the Scout Service, D\'Yan turned to a life of crime and hedonistic self-i
ndulgence, 
often running foul of the law with crimes including riot, grand larceny, murde
r, and 
attempted genocide[3], but usually managed to escape, (by a combination of Psi
onics, 
excessive violence, and blind luck). By 1113, however, she had managed to ange
r just 
about every law enforcement agency and organised crime syndicate in the entire
 Domain of 
Deneb, so she stole herself another Scout/Courier[4] and headed Rimward/Traili
ng, 
reaching the Solomani Rim shortly before war broke out[5]. After this, her act
ivities are 
unknown for several years, although it is believed she headed Corewards, just
ahead of the 
Solomani advance. She went into cold-sleep shortly after Virus struck, and was
 defrosted in 
1197.
D\'Yan has never been married, and has no children, although she does claim to
have 
been cloned several times. However, she cannot remember how many times, or whe
re it 
was done, and has no knowledge of the current location of any of the clones.

Appearance: D\'Yan is about average height for a Vargr, (1.5m), with black hair
, (now 
almost totally grey). She is quite attractive, if you\'re fond of hair, teeth,
and claws, and 
usually seems to be smiling at some private joke. The attractive appearance, h
owever, is 
rather offset by her pathological hatred of bathing, giving her a...err...uniq
ue aroma. D\'Yan 
dresses rather conservatively for a Vargr, preferring her old Scout Service ta
ilored vac suit 
with all insignia removed. If she expects to get into combat, D\'Yan wears a se
t of TL14 
Combat Armour, (which she has sprayed pink in the hopes that the enemy will th
ink she\'s a 
human). She uses the same helmet with both suits - this has been modified with
 a 
holographic projector to give the impression that there are goldfish swimming
around 
inside[7].

Personality: It is generally agreed that there is no such thing as a "typical
Vargr"; D\'Yan 
is the exception to this rule. Everything that has ever been said about Vargr
is probably true 
of D\'yan: she likes loud music, and even louder colour-schemes; she likes thin
gs that go 
fast, and things that go boom; she makes up the rules as she goes along, and b
elieves that 
laws are things that only apply to other people. D\'Yan\'s motto is: "if it feel
s good, do it...and 
keep doing it until you pass out and slide under the table." As an example of
how she puts 
this into practice, whenever D\'Yan arrives on a new planet, she throws a Party
. Note the 
capital \'P\'. The Parties are never advertised, they just happen spontaneously,
 usually 
beginning in a bar in a particularly seedy area of Startown, and ending...well
, almost 
anywhere. D\'Yan doesn\'t consider a Party to be a success unless a) it lasts mo
re than 12 
hours, b) the number of people involved is more than 500, c) the local authori
ties have to 
call in the Marines to end it, d) it costs more than MCr1, and e) she can actu
ally remember 
less than half of it.
Despite her age, and the abuse she regularly subjects her body to, she is stil
l in good 
physical condition and is hyperactive to the point that most people get exhaus
ted just 
watching her.
D\'Yan has one interesting idiosyncrasy: she gets very guilty about hurting peo
ple. In at 
least one case, after blowing someone\'s arm off she sent the unconscious body
by taxi to 
the nearest hospital, along with enough money to pay for a cybernetic replacem
ent.
Not surprisingly, D\'Yan\'s favourite food is raw meat, (ideally still alive). S
he will usually 
be satisfied with an extremely rare steak, but she does have a rather unnervin
g habit of 
cutting out "ginger-bread men" from it, Telekinetically animating them, and th
en 
enthusiastically chasing them around the room[8].

Motivation:
Joker: D\'Yan is, of course, certifiably insane.
Heart 4:  She likes people, and is generally fairly amiable and talkative.

Refereeing D\'Yan: As might have been guessed from the above description, D\'Yan
\'s 
primary function in a campaign is "comic relief". A secondary role is "re-occu
rring nuisance," 
- she can be dropped in whenever the PCs seem to be being too successful, or a
t a suitably 
inconvenient moment, (examples include D\'Yan stealing their starship, or a Par
ty taking 
place at the Starport, or maybe the PCs are on a sensitive diplomatic mission
to a low-tech 
planet, when suddenly a Scout/Courier lands in the town square, and D\'Yan jump
s out and 
starts robbing the bank).

Possessions: Extremely variable. D\'Yan makes most of her money by either gambl
ing 
or bank robbing, depending on how she feels and how well-armed the local polic
e are. 
However, she doesn\'t collect money or material possessions just for the sake o
f it, but 
merely as an aid to Having Fun. She will usually have Cr1D6x10^1D6 (Cr10 - MCr6
) available, 
usually carried loose in a large black holdall.
There are certain items that D\'Yan will always have:
· A bowl of goldfish.
· An IISS-issue TL15 tailored vac suit, slightly battered but still airtight.
· An suit of Imperial Marine-issue TL14 Combat Armour, painted pink, extremely
 
battered and no longer airtight.
· A TL12 Gauss Pistol, with several clips of assorted ammunition.
· An experimental TL16 Fusion Pistol, with one or two clips.
· A rather tatty-looking pink sheet of paper, (normally in a waterproof bag) -
 this is 
her psychological discharge from the Scout Service, and is her most valued 
possession.
· A blade weapon of some sort.

Quotations:
"Humans? What flavour?"
"These aren\'t my pets, they\'re my lunch!"
"Eek! Wet stuff!"
"Let\'s PAARRTY!!"

Notes:
[1] When she celebrates, everyone celebrates!
[2] D\'Yan is how she is normally known; her complete name is extremely long an
d 
known only to herself, and she regularly adds new syllables to it, (it tells t
he story 
of her life in her native tongue - of course, nobody outside Pscias speaks it,
 so 
she generally only uses it to annoy bureaucrats and officials who ask for her
full 
name).
[3] She encountered a minor race that tasted so disgusting she decided to wipe
 
them out.
[4] D\'Yan has a terrible memory, and can never remember where she parked her 
ship. Her solution is to steal a new one - preferably a Scout/Courier, since s
he 
usually travels alone. However, just in case she ever remembers where she 
parked one, she always sets up a bank account at every starport she visits wit
h a 
large enough balance to cover the docking fees for several years.
[5] She would like to believe there was a connection between these two events.

[6] D\'Yan claims to be able to identify a species by taste.
[7] She first tried using real goldfish inside a water-filled inner layer insi
de the helmet, 
but they kept dying. Plus, she was always afraid that the glass might break an
d 
get her wet.
[8] She rarely does this in private - she prefers to save it for expensive res
taurants, or 
when she is with people she wants to embarrass.

You know, at this point there is almost no reason to prefer one 
kind of jump flash over the other - at least as far as physics 
is concered.
However, from a gaming point of view there are a few things one 
would prefer/not prefer. For instance: that one not immediately 
be detected upon entry into a system - at least as long as one 
has a good ship, or is taking precautions.
But your comment about "entry directions" doesn\'t sit right.
after all, if you are "entering realspace" from jump-space, why 
would there be a "preferred direction"?  A doubt that a 
jump emergence would be like what you see in B5, i.e. a door in 
the flat 2D background on space. If it were, what would an observer
on the other side see? No, a picture where the ship entry radiates
isotropically is much easier to justify. 

also, why wouldn\'t jump signature depend on energy puped into the 
jump field? If you always got out the same amount of energy every 
time you opened a jump entry hole, you are violating conservation of 
energy -since the amount of energy necessary to open a "hole" 
depends on ship size and jump number...
If this violation were allowed, I have just figured out a new 
kind of power plant. (a small field generator that opens a hole 
into j-space and taps the energy there.) 

finally, there is a reference to jump signature depending on ship type
in an old MT Journal description of the Fiery class close escort...

Here\'s the latest and greatest Regency Sourcebook errata updated as of
4:45 pm Eastern Standard Time in the US (yes, this is Official GDW stuff):

page 35 - Government code `X` (Droyne Hierarchy) was inadvertently
left off the list.

page 45 - The subsector data listing for Wisconsin (Mithril) shows the
Stellar Data as `F4D`.  This should instead read `F4V`.

page 49 - Mille Falcs has a starport of `A` in 1202.  The subsector data
is correct, but the map (which shows a starport of `B`) is not.

page 51 - Trin in 1202 has a naval base per the subsector data and
the subsector description.  The map erroneously lists it as having a scout
base instead.

page 64 - References made to the 193rd Fleet should instead refer to
the 303rd.

page 64 (again) - Lucifer has a starport of `B` in 1202.  Another case
where the map is wrong but the subsector data is right.

page 86 - On the Damage Tables, areas 8-9, under Internal Explosion,
the text should read `1 - 6 : TS, 7 - 20 : Hold` not `17-20 Hold`.

page 90 - Under the description of the Cuspid-type Gunboat, the
range listed in hexes for the 300,000 km radio is `2`.  This should be
`10` instead.

page 92 - The last area was inadvertently left off the Damage Tables.
That line of text should have a line for Area 20, with nothing for surface
hits and `Eng` for the Internal Explosion portion of the table.

If you have any additional entries, please pass them along and I\'ll see
that GDW gets them as soon as possible.

Regards,

Harold

they don\'t match the stated design.  I wonder what the mass difference 
is between the two.  Also, what is the stated length of the ship(s) it 
is mounted on.  Does either the 14m or 15.35m design fit as L or .8*L? 
 
If you are designing plug in weapons, just do them.  The ship designer 
will pick the size that fits.  If you want them to be standard to the 
MIL, then they\'d have to fit the volume (and presumably length) 
requirements of the module.  Mass wouldn\'t be important for you as the 
plug-in designer... but it would be smart to look at the mass of the 
MIL and make sure that with your module the total mass would be within 
15*hull_displacement so the craft wouldn\'t suffer from carrying it 
(although it might be worth the trade if the weapon was nasty enough). 
 
I\'d be interested if anyone thinks a PAW with a damage value (or PV, or 
whatever it is :-) of 70 (max) could ever "rapidly inflict killing 
damage" (my paraphrase, probably not a direct quote) on a small 
starship.  Even most traders would have armor of 40 or so.  That means 
the PAW is as good as a laser only within 5 hexes (and much worse when 
you consider the excess damage will never be able to repenetrate the 
armor), and will only warm the hull at greater ranges.  Military ships 
are gonna be armor 60 (62, frequently for some reason), so it\'ll be lame 
even at under 5 hexes.  It\'s bad when the coaxial fusion gun with a 
1.something km short range is a much better weapon than your primary gun 
:-) 
 
I bet that a real varmit gun (a .22 or SKS) would do more damage by 
orders of magnitude than that PAW at BL type closing velocities. 
 
They should have made them open frame designs at whatever tonnage would 
allow a length of 25m (for a damage of 125).  They could get the volume 
down by having a short range if needed, but at least it would penetrate 
hulls with enough energy left over to do criticals to a small military 
ship.  Then they could use the illustration on the MT Fighting Ships for 
a picture of what it looks like (hmmm). 
 
Were the PAWs craft in question at TL15?  Maybe I\'ll try to make useful 
versions with said 25ish meter PAW. 
 
 
-Merrick 
---- 
 
Hi, 
 
With the Rshort being rounded to 1, it does make sense (unfortunately,
physics is magick to me) from a procedural point of view.  I\'ve got to give
Merrick credit here as well, as he initially brought up the rounding issue
to me. 
 
Merrick, from looking through the published ships, most are only armored to
Gmax x 10, so most traders are only armored to 10 or 20 (28 in some cases).
 If you consider the proportion of surviving merchant vessels to military
vessels as being high (which would make sense to me), vampire fleets are
going to consist of a lot armed merchant types and a few core naval types
(Note that I would modify the encounter procedure given in _Vampire Fleets_
, specifically the ship types, to apply only to a naval encounter result.
and that each ship encountered (if more than 1) should be rolled on the
initial encounter (merchant, civilian, naval, scout, non-starship) table). 
Following this chain of assumptions, a PA design should be effective
against the "screen".  Note also that virtually all non-military ships seem
to have St rather than Fb computers, and even several of the Hiver and RCES
ships only have one Fb and two St aboard. 
 
Having seemingly conquered the PA design problem (although it still doesn\'t
come out to the published stats), I figured I would try to reverse-engineer
the Fang-type SDB and then see what I could do with it.  Guess what?  I
couldn\'t do it.  There seem to be a number of quirks which don\'t follow the
published design sequences.  As a result, I\'m posting the published stats
for the Fang to see if anyone else can reproduce it, either using the 14m
PA or the (seemingly correct) 15.35 m tube. 
 
Help!!!

Notes 
 The Fang-type is the true SDB development of the initial Cuspid concept
seen above, although it is only the size of a heavy fighter.  Its
long-endurance and habitability allow it to perform most traditional SDB
missions, and its high-G performance allows it to handle with the best of
the fighters in Charted Space. 
 Small-to-moderate-sized particle accelerators like those fitted to the
Cuspid and Fang (they are only large in comparison to these small vessels)
are known in naval circles as "varmint guns."  They are able to rapidly
inflict killing damage on small starships, and their EMP side-effects make
short work of non-Fb computers.  Contrary to popular entertainment
programs, fighters are able to take on full-size warships only under the
most unusual of circumstances.  Fang SDBs are able to quickly strip away
the "nuisance vessels" in a vampire force, allowing the large fleet units
to quickly dispose of the major units. 
 The Fangs\' dual purpose (missile/beam) MFDs allow them to trade their PA
pods for the missile pods seen on the inspection launch.  Performance with
these pods falls to 4Gs with 64 G-turns (3.125cubic meters each), and crew
complement falls to four. 
 Fuel scoops allow the skimming of 280 m^3/hr, or 43 minutes for full fuel
load.

Well, I can make a good argument for *one* thing that *is detectable at
a distance, and *must* accompany every jump entry and exit. A "gravity
pulse". The was X amount of mass there, now it\'s gone. That means you
get a gravity wave radiating away.

Heck, we could detect this *now*. Only problem is, I\'m not real sure at
what *range* we could detect it. It would be subject to the inverse
square law, it\'d propogate at light speed, and it would be a distinct
signal.

Gravity waves aren\'t all that strong. On the other hand, this *is* the
sort of thing that would stand out. One important factor to consider is
how *fast* the ship appears/disappears. (ie time from 100% of mass
present until 0%). It *won\'t* be instantaneous.

Agreed. The gravity pulse (and any secondary effects from it) would be
solely based on the appearance/disappearance of the mass.

For the gravity pulse, the reason should be obvious. Because more mass
is appearing/disappearing.

> breakout. 

Definitely *not* true for a gravity pulse, and unlikely for anything
else. You aren\'t thinking four-dimensionally. The vector of the ship is
not connected at all with the "direction" it re-enters the universe
from. That direction is at right angles to the X, Y, *and* Z co-ordinates.

Think of pickking up a spinning top from a table (by a non-spinning
handle). You won\'t be able to place it back on the table from a
"direction" that will change the direction of spin. Likewise, the
velocity and momentum of a ship are the same when it returns from jump.
It\'s just at a different location. 

But the "flash" (the flexing of the table top when the top is lifted,
and the "thud" when it is dropped) will radiate in "all" directions. I
put "all" in quotes, because they\'ll only radiate in 3 dimensions...

Regarding the Fang SBD:

I\'m not exactly sure what problems you found, but I bet the Box/Cylinder
SL configuration has a lot to do with it...   Unless you know how much
is Box and how much is Cylinder you\'ll have trouble.  It\'s actually
pretty clever.  The arcs of fire are the same even for the two hull
forms.  I was planning on doing the Gormandoacy DD from High Passage #5,
but couldn\'t figure on the config.  I guess it\'ll be Wedge/Sphere or
Box/Sphere.  I\'d use the worse of the arcs of fire when in doubt (from
the taking damage perspective).

I had asked about the gs before, and my quick glance at wargames west
was wrong.  It meets the 15*disp requirement.

Because canonical text (I\'ll try to work out which) describes jump 1 to 6 as
relying upon breaking through to a different dimension (n+1 to n+6 - I don\'t
think this was as simple as x,y,z,time,Jump1,etc. I have a feeling n >> 4).
Since breaking out of jump from Jump 1 is from a different dimension to Jump
2, etc. then there _might_ be some excuse for having different jump exit sigs.

The following assumes you want to have jump exit \'flashes\':

>Why?  The flash is a point source of the instant of shift in the fabric of

Personally I don\'t figure a \'gateway\', \'through\' which the ship appears, but
rather to the observer a near instantaneous \'fading in\' of the ship as the
jump field is dispersed. Therefore the flash ought to correspond to the size
of the vessel since it comes from the interaction of the dying jump field
around the ship.

>More important is that the flash is only detectable in the direction of the
>breakout. 

For the reason given above I would assume the \'flash\' can be seen from any
direction since it is \'emitted\' from the entire jump field, i.e. every side
of the ship.

Just my Cr0.03 (Inflation of under 4%? Where do these bl**dy politicians buy
_their_ food?)

ULTRA SECRET 
From:Cmmdr Wafoua Syoisuis : 49th Squadron 214th Fleet Lewis Quarantine 253-1199
To: Vice Admiral Goron Amdon :  Chief of Naval Intelligence 214th Fleet

	My congratulations on your recent promotion, I look forward to
working with you again.  I have been asked by your predecessor to bring
you up to date on the situation on Lewis.  We have recently created and
released a RICE Paper for public dissemination.  This paper creates a
cover story that Lewis has become infected with a dangerous symbtiote,
of human creation.  For those 
suspicious individuals in the press and other organizations we have
created false evidence that the base on Lewis was researching
biological warfare agents, in violation of Emperor Martin III\'s edict. 
There is nothing concrete, just enough to suggest.  Hopefully this way
suspicious individuals will be diverted from the truth.  
	The actual story is not that much different than the official
story.  In 945 a research base was established on Lewis, not to study
biological improvements, but the geneering of psionic individuals.  
The base took several years to get established, in its early years it
did not make much progress.  It made a few minor improvements to psi
drugs and psionic shielding,  but nothing major.   During the Fourth
Frontier War, dozens on noble Zhodani were captured and shipped to
Lewis.  These individuals provided a large group of psions who shared a
common gene pool.   These specimens showed the researchers new
approaches to their problem.  In 1088 the Beta Epsilon batch of test
subjects was conceived.  By 1102 an above average number of specimens
showed psionic awareness.  The Beta Zeta and Beta Eta batches also
showed increased numbers of psions with increased strengths and variety
of psionic abilities.  The Beta 
Theta batch had to be destroyed, due to an unforeseen mutation.  The
Beta Iota batch was decanted in 1130, by 1139 the group was showing
unheard of levels of psionic abilities.  Seventy five percent were
psioniclly  active, with psionic strengths of five to ten, with three
cases of strengths of 18.  The Beta Kappa and Beta Lambda batches were
rushed into production.  During the summer of 1148 the Beta Iota
individuals, turned 18.  In the next year they started to show 
signs of mental instabilities. 
	The researchers carefully watched the Beta Kappa and Beta
Lambda groups. Both groups showed immense psionic strengths, and not
just in the common psionic abilities, but in many different Arcane
abilities.  unfortunately they also developed mental instabilities,
even earlier than in the Beta Iota group.  These include megalomania,
paranoia, schizophrenia, autism, mental retardation, multiple
personality disorder and obsessive compulsive behavior.  Production 
of the Beta Mu and Beta Nu batches were immediately halted, while a
solution was sought.  
	The researchers only had 6 months, before the Betas created
their own solution.  Led by a Beta Iota named Alexandra, they revolted.
 Most of the researchers were killed, the remaining were captured and
held as hostage.  Some of the Betas wanted to trade the hostages for a
ship in which they would roam the galaxy.  Alexandra put a halt to this
talk by incinerating the group\'s 
chief spokesman.  She then declared herself Emperor of the Known
Universe, and ordered a halt to contact with the "...mind deaf
Imperials."  She ordered that the Beta Mu, and Beta Nu batches be put
into production, and she ordered the creation of a Beta Xi group, which
consisted entirely of clones of herself.  Alexandra suffered from
megalomania and paranoia, aparticularly dangerous 
combination in a leader, especially when the leader  is a telepathic pyrotechnic. 
	The Commodore of  the orbiting squadron was on planet during
the revolt and was executed by Emperor Alexandra personally.  There was
quite a debate among the surviving Naval captains on how to react to
the revolt.  Some wanted to act with massive force and crush the
planet.  Others wanted to mount a rescue attempt, and then crush the
planet.  A few wanted to negotiate a settlement.  Finally a rescue
attempt was decided on.  The attempt was a dismal failure.  Two
companies of assault marines landed on the planet.  Though equipped with battle 
dress with integral psionic shielding, the marines were butchered by
the psions. Psionic shielding only slows down a strength 15 psion, and
it does nothing against telekinetic wielded plasma guns. 
	Upon hearing of the defeat, Subsector Command issued orders
calling for a temporary quarantine of the planet.  After several months
of debate, it was ordered that the quarantine be made permanent, and
the planet kept under constant surveillance.  It was thought that the
undesirable mental traits would be winnowed from the gene pool, by
natural selection.   Even if this did not happen, the Navy would be
able to study to see the long term biological effects of psionics. 
	The quarantine is maintened by the 49th Squadron of the 214th
Regency Fleet.  The planet is monitored by a series of orbiting
satellites.  Yearly, missions to the planet are mounted, These are
crewed solely by remotely controlled robots.  Each robot has a self
destruct mechanism, in case a psion with machine empathy manages to
take control of the robot.  These missions trade needed resources for
information that can not be gathered from orbit.  Some complexes await
the missions with anticipation, others try to destroy the missions, for
what ever goals they might have.  Occasionally the missions capture a
psion and bring back the specimen for in depth analysis.
	Since the revolt, life has not been good for the inhabitants of
Lewis.  It is standard procedure for experimental geneered individuals
to be sterilized at birth. This way the gene pool is strictly
controlled by the scientists in charge.  Early Betas such as
individuals from the Beta Beta and Beta Gamma batches, were used as lab
assistants at the research base.  These individuals 
were able to create new batches of Betas, which were fully fertile.  
The other major problem for the Betas was food.  Most food for the
research was grown on planet, but it required a great deal of foreign
assistance.  After several lean years, the Betas were able to create a
stable food supply.   Though it is precarious and does not make for a
varied diet.   
	The society of the psions is quite chaotic, as fits a mentally
unstable population.  The population consists of approximately 12,000
individuals.  These are gathered into 12 major groups of about 800
psions each, and 25 minor groups of varying size.  Each group does not
possess enough food, manufacturing, medical and technological resources
to be self sufficient.  Most groups trade to get access to the
necessary resources.  A few, especially of the smaller bands, 
resort to raiding, and banditry.  Local manufacturing is at TL 8, with
large amounts of high tech equipment still on planet.  The structure of
each of these bands is quite varied, some are democratic, some are
ruled by self proclaimed Queens, Dalis, Gods, and Lord Emperors, others
are simply ruled by the strongest.  The clones of Emperor Alexandra
have created a complex inhabited solely by clones of the original
Alexandra, who is kept alive in low berth.  It is considered one of the
more insane complexes.  Due to the sheer number of sociopaths, violent
crime is epidemic, most groups have incorporated this into their
society, through ritual challenges,  registered assassins and blood duels.

but never answered. Some have been covered here, most haven\'t.


1. Do Black Globes emit Hawking Radiation, (i.e. can this be used to detect th
em)?

2. What happened to Fast and Slow drugs? I can\'t find them in the TNE rulebook
. 

3. Can Nuclear Dampers be used to detonate nuclear warheads stored aboard an 
enemy ship?

4. ...and can they be used to do something unpleasant to a ship\'s fusion react
or, or Jump Drive?

5. ...and can they be used as an anti-personnel weapon?

6. What\'s the damage for being "hit" by active sensors or communicators, (e.g.
 can you use them to microwave someone to death)?

7. How big a bang does it make when you overload a ship\'s fusion reactor, or J
ump Drive?

8. FF&S says you need a seat on the Bridge of a starship for every Command cre
wmember - surely this can\'t be right? On big ships, (1000+ tonnes), this makes
the Bridge absolutely huge! I can see that they would all need a workstation,
but surely only a handful actually need to be on the Bridge?

9. It\'s always been implied that it\'s impossible for an observer to tell where
 a ship has Jumped to. 
However, by measuring the energy released when a ship Jumps, and comparing it 
to known characteristics of that class of ship, shouldn\'t you beable to 
calculate how far it has Jumped, (and so make a pretty good prediction of 
where it was going)?

10. Does a gun doing only 1D6-1 damage still do blunt trauma?

11. How do you design a beam laser, (e.g. a targeting laser)?

12. Do Psionics work through a Black Globe?

13. ...and does gravity, (artificial or real)? If no, then this would make lif
e..."interesting" for the pilot of the ship, since you couldn\'t, for example, 
orbit a planet, (and in theory, you could sail right past a black hole 
without any problems). If yes, then wouldn\'t this allow communication 
through it, (by using pulses of artificial gravity)?

14. Using aperture synthesis, could you combine the data from several ships fl
ying in formation to improve the performance of their sensors?

RICE Paper Lewis/Armis

Lewis  (3107 Armis/Spinward Marches) X-427344-8

Physical Appearance-Lewis orbits a F8 dwarf in a highly elliptical
orbit.  The planet also has an extreme axial tilt.  The eccentricity
and the axial tilt causes severe seasonal changes, in winter the
average temperature is  210K and in summer 300K.  The planet is a small
rugged world wracked by near constant violent storms.  Winds usually
average several hundred kilometers per hour.  
Due to the low air pressure this does not have the impact it would on a
earth normal world,  but the wind does kick up huge amounts of metallic
dust which hang in the air for days and weeks.  This dust is very
irritating to humans and other sapiens, requiring the use of filter
masks.  Sapiens who breathe the air without the aid of a filter mask,
come down with chronic lung infections as the dust particles irritate
the inner linings of the lungs and throat.  This wind borne dust
constantly erodes man made structures forcing most dwellings below
ground.  Lewis possess large shallow oceans.  During the winter they
are almost entirely frozen, while during the summer they evaporate only
to fall in torrential rain storms during the autumn. 

History-Lewis has been a declared a Red Zone by the Imperial Navy since
945.  The reason for the red zone were kept classified until now.  Now
under the Regent\'s new more open government the truth can be revealed. 
Lewis was established as a top secret research base in charge of
finding new military applications for biotechnologies.  These included
anti-bacterial warfare 
agents, creating geneered animals to serve in both combat and
intelligence roles, methods in speeding the growth of clones, (TEXT
DELETED BY ORDER OF NAVAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICE: ORDER 18734945-A)
,artificial RNA learning techniques and many other projects.  The
reason for the Red Zone was simply to keep away spies and others
without the Imperium\'s best interest at heart.  
	The results of the scientific experiments were filtered through
other research bases. This way the Zhodani and other enemies would not
even know that a top secret base even existed.  The Civil War did not
disrupt the research, as it was located far behind the Claw.   In the
aftermath of the Civil War, the base did suffer significant budget
cuts, but proceeded much as before.  
	In 1135 there was a major accident which would alter the world
forever.  The base had been doing research into artificial bacterial
symbiotes that would enable humans to exist in a vacuum without a
vacsuit.  The work was still far from finished, but proceding nicely. 
On 114-1135 an explosion of still unexplained origins ripped through
the lab where the symbiote was being designed.  The symbiote was
released into the atmosphere of the planet. The high speed winds
quickly dispersed the symbiote.  Over the next few days it became
apparent the symbiote was far from finished as it infected several
thousand people across the face of the planet.   Instead of allowing
the infected to survive in a vacuum, the symbiote slowly asphyxiated
the victim over a 
span of several hours.  By now the symbiote had been spread across the
entire surface of the planet and was thriving in the environment. It
was designed to survive in the cold vacuum of space, the atmosphere
provided more than enough heat and carbon dioxide to thrive.  An
immediate quarantine was placed around the planet.  All projects were
halted, as everyone tried to find an 
antidote.  unfortunately those scientists who understood the symbiote
best where the first to die. After six months, no progress had been
made towards a cure and over half the population had died.  What made
the task so difficult was the symbiote had been designed to withstand
the extremes of space, high and low temperatures, high levels of
radiation and vacuum.  It could be killed by extreme methods such as
plasma bursts, but this wasn\'t a practical method of 
decontaminating infected individuals.  The populace holed up small
groups in underground bunkers.  
	The Navy Commander in charge of the planet made the painful
choice to permanently close the planet.   Slowly the underground
bunkers became infected, until the population has dwindled to barely 
8000 out of 70,000 former inhabitants.  Estimates suggest that within
40 years the remaining inhabitants will perish.  A small group of
scientists still tries to find a way of 
defeating the symbiote, but a solution evades their grasp, as the
symbiote continues to mutate and adapt.  The Navy maintains a squadron
in the system to prevent anyone from violating the quarantine.  It also
drops frequent mercy packages to aid the survivors. The only penalty
for violating the quarantine is life long exile to the planet.  When
asked about the severe actions of 
the Navy,  Cmmdr Wafoua Syoisuis replied, "Its better then dealing with
another Virus."

Society- Before the release of the symbiote, humans and other sapiens
lived in underground complexes, to avoid the dust storms, and the
extremes in weather.  It was lucky for the inhabitants, because if the
symbiote had been released on a standard world, no one would have
escaped.  Now the complexes have had 70 years to fortify themselves
against the symbiote, through complex filtering and airtight seals. 
For the most part these keep the symbiote at bay, but every 
so often something breaks down, and the complex is infected, usually
yielding a large death toll.  That is if anyone is left alive to count the bodies.  
	There are somewhere between ten and thirty complexes on Lewis. 
The average population is several hundred people.   Each complex has
grown into one extended family, with most people being related through
marriage.  The families govern the complexes through small town
meetings.   Most people never leave their complex; the possibility of
contamination arises each time someone leaves or enters.  Except for
the retrieval of Naval mercy shipments, it is only in the most dire of
circumstances that anyone leaves a complex.  The shipments are usually
picked up by robots. When someone is forced to leave the compound it is
in airtight ATVs, when they return, the exterior is scoured with a high
temperature plasma  to kill any of the symbiote that might have
attached itself to the vehicle.   
	The complexes keep in contact through a computer and video
network.  So while they might not be able to leave their complex, they
will be able to meet and become friends with people across the globe. 
Entertainment from around the Regency are beamed to the complexes by
the Navy.  Most inhabitants are a fairly dour and grumpy lot.  They
resent being forced to live on such a miserable planet under miserable
circumstances.  Most couples do not plan on having children, they feel
it wouldn\'t be right to bring children into such a place. The only new
population comes from accidental pregnacies.

   As to whether it\'s all available online some place, I don\'t know that it

"Imperial ethical theory is seen to be deficient in the area of advanced 
genetics and bioengineering" - Regency sourcebook 81.

**************

Just got the Sourcebook on Monday.  Very nicely done: my only 
disatisfaction is on what they did to the Nobility: true, it\'s just my
political/sentimental gripe, but still...

Frank Chadwick spoke of "Great steaming heaps of material" out there on 
the Spinward Marches/Domain of Deneb, which didn\'t fit inot our petite 
sourcebook.  If they never put it into book form, and don\'t publish it in 
Challange articles, how will we ever get our hands on it?

A bit of inconsistencies regarding "parallel government": it seems that 
there is a parallel structure of Regency elected officals and Nobility, 
but some noble seats don\'t exist (ie. there is no longer a "Duke of 
Regina", as that seat disapeared when Norris died.)

****Immortals****

In Survival Margin, there are a number of drugs that are presented, which 
can help PC\'s from the MegaT era enter the New Era: These include "Fast" 
and "Slow" drugs, which modify how time affects the body (Fast makes 
time seem to go by very quickly, Slow slows the awareness and effects of 
time on the body, I think.)  There has always been anagathics, and now 
there is Anagathics B, which makes one immortal as long as you never 
enter jump space.  And there are low berths, too.

Anyone have a way to deal with all these immortals and near-immortals?
How does Imperial culture view them? (Note: Nobles are traditionally 
discouraged/forbidden from using anagathics)

****A few errors, UWP codes****

pg 37  

Ziron (1110) is shown to have a Zho naval base, rather then a standard base.

Grant (1607) is shown to have Zho refugees, which is impossible, as it\'s 
always been Red Zoned.

Other\'s, anyone?

****Minor Note:Genetic Engineering****

It\'s odd that the Nobility has never attempted to \'redesign\' itself to be 
more effective governours.  Of course, you don\'t know what the goals of 
such engineering would be.  Had I been present at the Regency creation, 
I\'d have explored this possibility, rather than destroy the nobility.  
Still, it may have been necesary for GW to do so: had such a nobility 
been created, we\'d either have a master race ruling over everyone or have 
a profoundly noble elite, rendering the Regency as safe as Hometown, U.S.A.

I\'m going to have to ask for more details because NONE of them have the 
trilogy by Paul Brunette on their listings.  They have other books by GDW 
but nothing under his name or the three titles someone was kind enough to 
provide.  Also _Survival Margin_ and _Hard Times_ are not listed either.  
I was told to get the ISBN numbers.  Could someone be kind enough to 
provide me one for the first book in the trilogy? 

  I\'d rather not order the accessories books from GDW since I don\'t know 
if I\'m going to run TNE or not.  I have a lot of reservations so far.  
Thanks guys.

>>Hi there.  Someone said jump flashes are non-canonical.  But aren\'t they

Though an excellent resource, some of the information in the Starship Ops 
Manual is now "non-canonical."  In fact, the existence of the lanthanum 
grid has been revoked.  Jump energy is now accumulated in the lanthanum 
coils in the drive room.  The ship effectively tears a hole in jump space 
with energy generated in the coils (much like a homopolar generator) and 
hurtles itself into the breach, like a stargate or something.  

Because the lanthanum grid is no longer canonical, ships can now attach 
other craft or freight to the outside of their hulls and enter jumpspace.  
The astrogator must recalculate the ship\'s volume for jump entry.  The 
ship\'s jump capacity may be affected by the size of any additional mass 
attached to the ship.

Whether or not there\'s a jump flash, therefore, is still debatable, but I 
would say the increased amount of energy generated by your ship\'s jump 
drive would create a fair-sized EMP.  I\'m not sure the blue flash is 
supposed to be generated with the "new canon" or not.

Not according to our friend, Dave Nilsen.  He and his co-authors, quite 
rightly I think, have changed the rules as listed above.  The coils are now 
the focus, not the grid (which doesn\'t exist anymore).  Therefore a slight 
change of "canon" has been enacted.

  {
    'body' => 'Hi all, 
 
My problems with the Fang are multitudinous (in fact, almost everything
except the Disp*15 vs Gs issue. 
 
First is the Configuration problem.  One would suspect from the picture
that the main hull is the box config and the PA pods were the cylinders. 
Also, the notes for the Modular Inspection Launch state that for a total 70
tons displacement, a base 50 ton hull is used plus two 10 ton missile pods
and that the Configuration is Wedge/Box SL.  Since the same missile pods
can be used on the Fang it would make sense to assume that the base Fang
hull is a base 30 ton cylinder and that the PA pods are each 10 ton boxes. 
This seems to be logical.  When I began to plug the details into my TL-15
spreadsheet, however, I began to run into problems, the main one being
reconciling Length to displacement.  A 50 ton hull gives a base length of
11.2 meters.  Cylinder SL config gives a Lmod of 2, meaning final L = 22.4
meters.  The published L for the Fang is 23 meters.  Close enough for me.  
The problem is that for the 30 ton main hull, you get a base L of 9.2
meters, modified to 18.4 meters for a cylinder configuration.  The two 10
ton pods would have a base L of 7 meters, modified to 8.75 meters for a box
configuration.  How do you get 23 meters for the length?  If you design the
vessel as a base hull and two modules/pods, it would seem to me that you
would have to take the L for the base hull and the L for the modules and
determine the final length of the vessel based upon the location of the
modules.  Given the hit locations of the PA pods, it does not seem that one
would add them directly, and looking at the picture (obviously not the
thing to do here), as they are mounted parallel, you\'re not going to get
any addition to the length of the main hull.  Also, we come back to the
mystery of the PA tunnel length.  As published at 14 meters, this would
follow from a cylinder form for the 10 ton PA  pod.  the 14 meter module
plus the length of the main hull (unmodified at 9.2meters) would equal 23.2
meters, rounded down to 23 meters.  However, a box configuration for the
main hull would modify to 11.50 meters.  What\'s what here? 
 
Second problem:  Power. 
The Fang is listed with a 372 MW fusion plant.  Each PA is powered to 109
MW (218 total).  The Fang has an acceleration of 6 Gs at 25 MW/G (a total
of 150 MW to thrust).  Total power so far 368 MW.  Add in the other systems
and you have a shortfall of 37.67 MW.  Of course, you can make this up by
adding a small power plant to each module, but it doesn\'t say anything in
the specs about that. 
 
Third problem:  EMM 
The EMM values are calculated for a 30 ton displacement, so either the pods
are not masked, or they carry their own EMM, which goes back to readjust
the pod on-board power plant. 
 
Fourth problem:  Passive EMS 
Given as a fixed array of 120,000 km short range.  My FF&S says that this
array has a diameter of 20m and that if the array\'s diameter is greater
than the unmodified length of the hull that it must be folding.  The
unmodified length of even a 50 ton hull is only 11.2 meters so it would
have to be folding. 
 
Fifth problem:  Pod/Module 
Given that the design rules for pods and modules are somewhat different
(Reformation Coalition Equipment Guide p.154), consistent terminology is
helpful for those of us interested in following the design sequences used. 
 
To GDW:  If you are still following the mailing list, please post the
design sequence so I can figure out where I\'ve gone wrong (if I have.) 
 
Thanks, 
 
Will Nourse

Okay, now I\'ve got a question.  Where does it say that the lanthanum
grid doesn\'t exist anymore?  Are you sure that you\'re not remembering
in some sort of RPN fashion?

The only reason I ask is because you mention drive coils.  Now I
remember the zuchai crystals in the drive coils (these were the HPG in
the j-drive) from CT.

Then, the system was updated and the lanthanum grid was added along to
the crystals in MT.

I don\'t remember reading any differently in TNE.

Even with a ship grappled to yours, you could still jump.  Remember,
the jump grid was just supposed to create the energy signature required
to punch the hole from n-space to j-space.

        Huh!?!? From whence did this come? (Not that I\'m arguing, as it
solves a question I\'d had concerning the Clippers and modules outside the

I thought that the jump grid normally formed a safety net of 1m around
the ship, but could be expanded to include an attached craft.

***More minor errors for the Regency Sourcebook***

pg 69 Zaguki (Deneb: 0710) has an Aslan gov code of "G" in 1117, and a 
      Human gov code of 5 in 1202.  Highly unlikely, as only in 1202 did 
      70% of the pop become Aslan.

      Banskonno (Deneb: 0112), Aldaya (Deneb: 0212), and Helifil (Deneb: 
      0313) don\'t have this problem: their codes change from Alsan to 
      human, but they were originally Aslan in the first place.

***Aside***

The subsectors for Reft Sector haven\'t been changed, apparently.  This 
is different than the old drafts for the New Era Regency showed, which 
still can be found at deneb.cc.missouri.edu (I think).

***Comment***

O.K., so now the current regime now is going to strive to create a 
humanistic, interstellar metaculture for all, rather than focus on a 
developing an elite culture, and leaving everyone else alone.  I understand 
where the Regent is coming from: however, as a libertarian at heart, I 
still regret it.

Even so, it should be interesting to watch.  

Regarding government, it seems that the Regent/Emperor will end up 
becoming a constitutional monarch or an elected position.  And since 
elections are not necesarily \'one-man, one-vote\', there\'s some wiggle 
room for all those non-democratic systems, too.

***Comment 3***

It seems that all Imperial nobles which retain their fiefs are all 
\'elected for life\' nobles.  If they can pass on their fiefs to their 
children, there children must first be elected from the population.

Hmmm.  Here in Canada, we have two governing houses, an elected Commons 
and an unelected Senate.  While the western parts of the nation want\'s to 
make the Senate elected, the Commons don\'t want to do so. If it\'s 
elected, then the Senate then gains some legitimacy, and can stop the 
Commons from doing exactly what it wants (the best it can currently do it 
slow it down.)

Because the surviving Nobility will all be elected (at least once), they 
would tend to be more powerful than the British House of Lords, but less 
powerful than either the House of Commons or the Imperial 
Senate (the popularily elected governing body).  

The real surviving power of the Moots is not control of the State, but 
more due to their lonegevity.  Senators are elected for three-year 
terms, which is rather short (esp. for an interstellar civilization).
Nobles are elected for life, but have no real power except speech, 
suggestions, and public awards or disgracing.

What happens to the Moots really depends on the actions of the Nobles.  If 
they really take on their new role, the Moots can easily become an 
unoffical power centre.  If they don\'t, they\'ll become the patrionage 
pigsty that the Canadian Senate is.

An aside: currently, the Moot\'s are thinning out, since most noble 
positions are being revoked now, or at the time of the noble\'s death.  
Eventually, there will be a stable level of nobles, mainly from worlds 
with higher law levels, autocratic governments, and higher populations.

Interestingly, it\'s quite possible for a "self-perpetuating oligarchy" 
(ie. classic, Terran-style noble governments) or a "feudal technocracy" 
(the unoffical government form of the Third Imperium) to retain their local 
nobility in powerful positions, and yet have no Imperial nobles.

***Comment 3***

One of the things I really like about the Regency (Besides the fact that 
they still consider themselves Imperials) is all those new faces, Aslan, 
Sword Worlder\'s, Vargr, and Zhodani, within Imperial borders.  More 
variety! More variety! 

Also, for those of us who take the long view of things, it\'s a great 
laboratory to develop the government of the revisied Third/Fourth 
Imperium.  If the Regency can somehow forge a nation of all these 
peoples - and satisfy the demands of classic Imperial culture - and 
adapt to the Great Land Rush of 1202 - what a very interesting place it 
would be!

***Comment 4***

It seems that it\'s going to take longer than expected for anyone - RC or 
Regency - to expand into the Wilds.  Sure, RC and Regency spaceships can 
meet each other by 1205 or so, but it\'s going to take a good bit longer 
to settle the area, even with Zho refuges and high birthrates.  

***A tip of the hat...***

That bit about Endup/Lucifer was among the more elegant pieces of 
antiImperial \'propaganda\' ever done, a good bit more worthy than the 
ranting from RC.  And the Regent responded with real class, too.  Very 
nicely done, GDW!

I hate to break this to you, but Lewis/Aramis has been
done already.

Quoting from _The Traveller Adventure_, (c) 1983: circa 1105 Imperial

Lewis (0707 [Aramis subsector]-X427402-D) is a small world with a diameter
of approximately 6400 kilometers, a very thin, tainted atmosphere, and large
oceans covering three-quarters of the surface of the planet. A young world,
Lewis is one of several satellites of the only gas giant in the system.
       The world has a population of just over 73,000 persons, mostly farmers.
There is no government established on the world; among the farming 
communities family ties predominate -- a system which has worked well for
several generations. A D-class starport facility exists on the world (as well
as several smaller landing fields of even lower quality); this is controlled
by the Tukera family and reserved for their use.
       Lewis was, indeed, entirely owned by the Tukeras for quite some time, 
but, about 150 years ago, a Tukera baron in need of funds was forced to
sell off some family lands to outside settlers. This community 
flourished for quite some time; recently, the family has been attempting
to recover those lands and the ownership of the world. After several
unsuccessful efforts to force the independent settlers to sell out, Tukera
interests at Court (with the support of the Marquis of Aramis) have
managed to have the planet interdicted. A special dispensation allows
the family to come and go as they please, but all trade and outside
contact have been cut off, isolating the settlers. So far they have shown
an amazing degree of self-sufficiency, but the Tukera family still
believes that increasing the hardships of this isolation will eventually 
compel them to give up and sell their land.
       The Tukera estates at Inselberg on Lewis are isolated from the
main areas of settlement, surrounded by desert and protected by 
an excellent security organisation. The nearest town is some 100 km
away. Inselberg\'s facilities enjoy a tech level of D; the settlers are
limited to a much lower level of technology (7).

End quote.

This was from before the Rebellion and Virus, so there\'s plenty
of room for change, but this is the setting as so far established.

Note that I don\'t quite buy the assertion (made in the "Zila" entry
on RSB page 39) that "Tukera interests...abandoned the Domain."
The Domain by that time was already cut off by Vargr incursions,
and separated from Margret\'s faction by the Vilani and the other
"big three" Throne-seekers, so even if the Vilani megacorps
made a break for it, its much less likely Tukera would even 
recieve orders to do so, much less actually try it.

A more likely fate is : cut off from it\'s long-distance routes to
the rest of the Imperium, the Deneb splinter of Tukera Lines, LIC
was forced to compete more directly with Al Morai, Oberlindes, 
and other companies native to the Domain. Without the advantage
of its long-haul infrastructure, it started to wilt, and if it still exists
at all is only a shadow of its once-glorious self. (Norris may have
subtly encouraged this, especially after the return of Arrival Vengeance.)

	I was not satisfied with the rules for robotic arms that were 
	presented in Vampire Fleets. The main reason for this is that 
	according to these rules the robotic arms do not improve with 
	higher TL, while vehicle suspension and transmission values 
	improve. Even though robotic arm is more complex device than 
	walker legs, they should have many similar problems and 
	solutions.

	One additional requirement for robotic arms is the Cybernetics 
	rules in FFS. According to the Peripheral Options table (FFS 
	page 86) prosthetic replacement limbs "Utility Arm" appears at 
	TL-10, and pseudobiologic "slick" versions appear at TL-12. I 
	think that it should be possible to build these prosthetic 
	limbs with normal robotic rules.

	According to human taxometry, the average displacement of man\'s 
	arm is approximately 7 liters. This means that TL-12 prosthetic 
	arm for the average man should displece 7 litres, and should 
	have at least AGL-6 and STR-6.

	Quick-and-dirty design fix:

	TL	AGL	STR	Price
	8	10%	1	100
	10	9%	1.5	150
	12	8%	2	200
	14	7%	2.5	250
	16	6%	3	300

	AGL:	The percentage of total volume used per point of AGL.
	STR:	The amount of STR gained per liter devoted to strength.
	Price:	The price of one liter of robotic arm. Pseudobiological 
		versions will have the price multiplied by 8. 
		Prostethic replacements will also have extra price for 
		surgery, calibration and rehabilation.
	Mass:	The mass of an arm in kilograms is its volume in liters
		multiplied by 2 (as stated in VF, page 74).
	Power:	The power requirement for robotic arms is its volume in
		liters multiplied by 0.4 kW.

	According to this table, TL-10 AGL-6, STR-6 robotic arm would 
	displace 8.7 liters, and similar TL-12 arm would displace 5.8 
	liters. 


	Powering Robots

	Thought VF has ignored the power usage of robotic arm, the arm 
	must be somehow powered (this is major problem in modren 
	prosthetic technology, and different power sources and 
	transmissions are beign developed). However the required input 
	power shown above is only the peak power usage, required only 
	when the arm is used to move its maximum load at full speed. 
	Full input power could be required for cargo loading arms, but 
	it is highly unlikely that other machines would need this much 
	power.

	In my designs I usually build robots with PNF power plant, and 
	allocate the robotic arms only 20-50% of the their maximum 
	input power. Additionally I install an suitable battery that 
	can power the arms for a short time at full power. This means
	that the robot will use its arms with full power only when
	needed, and in other times the surplus power is loaded into the
	battery.

	I have noticed that battery-powered robots can be quite tricky 
	to use. A re-designed TL-14 Zhodani WarBot will exhaust its 
	batteries in few days if it is fully powering all its 
	components at the same time, but the same WarBot can be in 
	sentry mode for a few months (that is, powering only its brain 
	and passive sensors).

"You betcha."

    "And anything beyond 1 metre of the ship is \'cut off\' when entering jump."
"Hell yes. It never worried anyone before, so why change it now? What\'s more
logical: a contained hull field which is naturally adapted to any hull
configuration because it _is_ the hull, or some dicky doohah in the engine
room which just sorta throws out a field at a specific distance from it with
no peculiar effects inside and somehow magically matched to any sticky-out
bits on the ship - I mean Hell, I know all about beam-steering theory,
adaptive antennas and all that e-war stuff, but this is plain silly. Can you

COMMODORE BOULTON REPLIES...

    "And now we turn to our sixty second round of Answer Andrew Boulton\'s
questions. This week our contestant is Griff Turnpike Ricotta, chief
scientist at the Regency institute for growing turnips. Straight into the
questions, Griff."

"Go for it Bob... I mean Andy."

    "Do Black Globes emit Hawking Radiation?"

"I\'ll say \'No\' simply because canon Traveller sensors can\'t detect them."

    "What happened to Fast and Slow drugs in TNE?"

"I\'ll say \'lack of consistency\', please Bob... I mean Andy."

    "Can Nuclear Dampers be used to detonate nuclear warheads stored aboard
an enemy ship?"

"Ah, probably not - hence the usage of the word \'damper\' - I think dampers
can only discourage a reaction, not encourage detonation."

    "And can they be used to do something unpleasant to a ship\'s fusion
reactor, or Jump Drive?"

"I\'ll guess yes - they could try to \'subdue\' the ship power plant or jump
drive. But the damper fields should be fairly easily detected by the ship
being affected."

    "And can they be used as an anti-personnel weapon?"

"I don\'t think so Andy, although they might stunt the growth of turnips."

    "What\'s the damage for being "hit" by active sensors or communicators,
(e.g. can you use them to microwave someone to death)?"

"Most definitely Andy - very nasty too, since you cook from the inside out
and it tends to be the wet bits that cook most, like your eyes, for example.
We have quite stringent rules to prevent unauthorised microwaving of our
turnips."

    <glancing worriedly at Griff> "How big a bang does it make when you
overload a ship\'s fusion reactor, or Jump Drive?"

    "Well, when a turnip goes to pieces, it\'s pretty nasty, Andy - bits
every... oh, sorry, yes, err... well, recent discussions have indicated that
a fusion system going haywire tends to melt down a bit and then die off
pretty quickly because the reaction isn\'t very good at sustaining itself. I
think more important is the likely release of a huge cloud of vapourised
hydrogen fuel which would likely ignite in a big fireball when combined with
an oxygen atmosphere. There used to be lots of worries about ships taking
out whole starports but I think that now you\'d really only damage the ship
itself - and probably irradiate it a bit so it can\'t be used for a while.
Did you know that all our turnips are irradiated?"

    <winking meaningfully at the returning security guards> "Ok, Griff.
Nearly out of time. FF&S says you need a seat on the Bridge of a starship
for every Command crewmember - surely this can\'t be right?"
"Well, there was a big discussion on that recently. Some members could have
\'portable\' stations instead, while realistically on a big ship perhaps only
one third or half the command crew would actually be on the bridge. It might
also be that some of the space allocated for these \'seats\' is actually just
space for control systems to \'link in\' data from the appropriate command
crew\'s position rather than them actually being physically present on the
bridge..."

    "It\'s been implied that it\'s impossible for an observer to tell where a
ship has Jumped to. However, by measuring the energy released when a ship
Jumps, and comparing it to known characteristics of that class of ship,
shouldn\'t you be able to calculate how far it has Jumped, (and so make a
pretty good prediction of where it was going)?"

"Tricky one, Andy. Well, as that clever Cmdr. Lilly has mentioned before
jump actually uses multiple dimensions, so yes you should be able to tell
how far the ship is jumping. And thinking logically, the only time the ship
can affect its destination is in the configuration of the jump field
_before_ entering jump - we know you can\'t alter things once _in_ jump. So
if you can observe and interpret the jump field, yes I believe you can tell
fairly well where the ship is jumping to. Only military ships would have
such sensors, though and you need a damned powerful computer. And the
military might be quite coy about the fact, so maybe that\'s why most people
don\'t know you can do it."

    "Ok Griff, does a gun doing only 1D6-1 damage still do blunt trauma?"

"I don\'t think so. But it would badly bruise a turnip, Andy."

    "How do you design a beam laser, (e.g. a targeting laser)?"

"I just tend to make it up as I go along, Andy. Maybe as per a pulse laser
but multiply the power by the pulse length (in fractions of a second) and
then reduce it a bit to allow that a beam would overheat the laser
components more quickly, etc."

    "Do Psionics work through a Black Globe?"

"I\'ve never seen it done, although inter-stellar psionic communication seems
to be possible at faster-than-light speed, so maybe that\'s using an extra
dimension a bit like jump, in which case maybe you can use psionics
\'through\' a globe."

    "So does gravity, (artificial or real) work through a Black Globe?"

"No. Because canonically, densitometers can\'t detect ships in globes. But
perhaps the effect is limited to low levels of gravity. Strong gravitic
pull, like in a Black Hole might involve enough energy that the globe
becomes overloaded."

    "So communication through it by using pulses of artificial gravity is a
no-no?"

"I\'d have thought so, Andy."

    "Using aperture synthesis, could you combine the data from several ships
flying in formation to improve the performance of their sensors?"
"Definitely Andy, although they would need to have _very_ accurate knowledge
of their relative positions at any instant. TL8 technology can do that sort
of thing using multiple satellite passes over a given location. Even if the
passes aren\'t exactly over the same spot, data from each pass can be
combined to give ridiculous resolution. Just imagine two turnips spinning...
mmmf"

    "Thank you again security... Griff, you scored one canonically correct

means you\'ll be back tomorrow to answer yet another round of "Commodore

FF&S DESIGN ROUND

    "Now we have back with us Lt. Hangdog Wildebeest from the Naval Office
of Designing Non-Canon Starships and Altering Official FF&S Designs to
Confuse Readers. Well, Lt., we have a few quick questions for one of our ace
watchers - YES, \'Frances A. McLaughlin\', THIS IS YOUR MOMENT! Frances is a
bit worried about the Fang SDB, Hangdog. First is the Configuration problem..."

"Don\'t let all the FF&S stuff confuse you, Frances. Design the ship
_components_ first then worry about fitting a hull _around_ them. Hell, all
these \'length\' rules for different shapes is just for _standard_ designs.
Here at the NODNCSAOFF&SDCF, we know the basic formula for the volume of a
cylinder so if it\'s a given volume and we need a certain length, we just
alter the radius accordingly. Hell, who cares about \'Lmod\'s!"

    "Thanks Lt. And on the Power question - i.e. the Fang has a 372 MW
fusion plant but needs about 410 MW to power everything at once?"

"Been there, seen it, done it. Few ships ever turn on every single light
bulb at once, so a bit of leeway is always allowed. Remember, we\'re talking
about peak powers, mean powers, rated powers, etc. That PA casing might say
\'Min pow feed 109 MW\' but the manufacturers _always_ allow a little leeway."

    "What about EMM, Lt.? Are the pods masked or do they carry their own EMM?"

"Sorry, Andy, but that\'s classified information."

    "You can\'t tell us, then?"

"Nope."

    "Aw, Go on."

"Ok. I don\'t know, actually."

    "Hmmm. The passive EMS is supposedly a fixed array with 120,000 km short
range but FF&S says this ought to be 20m diameter and thus a folding array?"

"That\'s just like the P.A. power thingy above. Damned designers are always
boasting about performance then you buy the ship and damn you if it doesn\'t
have a 10 kk short range or some damned huge folding array out the back
which - naturally - didn\'t happen to appear on the publicity photo."

    "Couldn\'t just be the usual design cock-up, then?"

"Well, okay, I\'d say that\'s probably the real reason."

    "Thank you, Lt. Hangdog."

CANON

    "And, last but not least, we ask our \'moral\' question of today. Given
that the Starship Operator\'s Manual was approved by GDW and therefore its
section on Jump drives is cannonical, what should our response be to a quote
such as: \'Not according to our friend, Dave Nilsen. He and his co-authors,
quite rightly I think, have changed the rules as listed above. The coils are
now the focus, not the grid (which doesn\'t exist anymore). Therefore a
slight change of "canon" has been enacted.\'"

    "Perhaps we should examine the dictionary definitions of \'quite
rightly\', \'slight change\' and \'total lack of continuity as usual\'?"

   All you have to do is ask....

The Death of Wisdom by Paul Brunette - ISBN 1-55878-181-1

   Also....

Survival Margin - ISBN 1-55878-139-0

Hard Times - ISBN 1-55878-085-8

   I believe that both Survival Margin and The Death of Wisdom are still
in print.  Hard Times is I believe, out of print, but GDW may still have
copies of it available for sale.

   I am curious as to what you have problems with, the new game
mechanics (based more on the T:2000 System) or the story
development.  Which would you say is causing you the most problems
conceptually?

know, a similar discussion is happening on the xboat list.

As for the field happening "a meter from the hull" and thus cutting off 
attachments, this is only a problem for ad hoc adjustments.  One can 
assume that droppable fuel tanks have their own lanthanum grid which 
plugs in to the ship\'s.  For those wanting to carry ore strapped to the 
outside, you need a big lanthanum net (I remember seeing an illustration of 
this somewhere...).

I don\'t know about Drake, but I have always thought the GDW House System 
to be overly complicated and lacking in any possibility of character 
development after creation.  

But I love the TNE setting.  I have plans to run TNE using the HERO rules.

First, a question.  Where am I missing this?  I haven\'t seen any
mention that the lanthanum grid doesn\'t exist anymore.  Yet, everyone
else here has.  So, what pages am I skipping over that I should be

Second, a suggestion.  For people interested in beam lasers, melee
weapons, and a whole bunch of other stuff, I highly recommend Guns,
Guns, Guns! (3G^3) by BTRC and it\'s companion piece More Guns.  It not
only provides weapon creation rules, but it also provides conversion
notes between various game systems (GDW House, GURPS, Torg...).

Between 3G^3 and FFS I can crank out an arsenal of goodies.  8)

radio, auto snub pistols with 2 reg and 1 tranq mags, a 
\'stun baton\' that did stun only damage, a \'super\' vibro knife,
PRIS goggles, a terminal/dispatch screen/ticket book (w/hard copy
for offender)/form writer. They also had flak type armor
and as this world had a lot of TL 10+ ground cars they were in 
cars alot, as well as covered air rafts (because they were
senior Sgts).
I had some fun expecting them to know things they didn\'t,
and sent them out to work with only one days training
because they were \'old hands\' on their fake records.
(The terminal was also a map, and dispatch points were high lighted)
They started out with a ticket, and then went to a spouse abuse
that was really a fight, with the hidden child the real victim.
The DD turned violent, and they got to try out their stun batons
(The provost ordered only strength 5, even though they would go
to 10).
I ran them through a few more of these (just watch cops for
ideas, I used what really happened to me this summer
when my National Guard MP unit did LE on a base),
and then sent them into MPI as dicks on a case of what seemed
to be a case of AEA (the patron got to the Provost, and their
fake records showed past MPI time).
To amke all this more real I kept harping on how short staffed
the MPs were.
It turned out that the guy that was dead was the same guy
they were undercover to get something from in the first place
(they still don\'t know what). (Only 2 were actually assigned
the case).
They followed the clues (mostly) and found the dead man\'s
girl friend in a "Slum Town" strip bar outside the gate,
just ahead of the bad guys, who came in guns blazeing.
As it happened, they wern\'t doing too good, so the female
recruits there to see "Marc" the male stripper in action
took one of them out. They think that they recovered the item,
and are ready to unass the planet.
The whole thing seemed to go well. The biggest problem is that
they wanted to investigate everything first, and then follow up
clues.

There\'s something that I just recently reread in Rats and Cats about how 
GenAssist tried to genetically engineer supermen of some sort, but that 
fear of the program\'s portents ultimately led to its downfall.  It seems a 
prominent genetic engineer had been experimenting with the hyperevolution 
of several species of primate, like orangs and chimps.  Apparently the 
project was swept under the rug and the uplifted apes were let alone 
somewhere.  

I was inspired enough by this little piece that I was thinking I might 
write a RICE paper on a wilds world somewhere in Aldebaran or Neworld 
Sector that is solely inhabited by several species of these uplifted apes.  
Can anyone say, "Planet of the Apes," Traveller style?  Hmm.  Better get to 
work on that one.

At any rate, the general hysteria about producing genetically superior 
humans is probably why the nobility never got away with really widespread 
projects of this sort.

I\'m sure, alright.  I gleaned this information in a phone conversation with 
Dave Nilsen, just before the RSB came out.  He said he didn\'t like the 
lanthanum grid thing and that the PTB are redoing the technicalities of 
jump.

They may not have published anything yet, but I think I recall something 
that hinted at this development in the Regency Sourcebook.  I just can\'t 
remember exactly where it was.  Nothing like convenient memory lapses! <g>

The secons lbe is indeed an intergral part.  It\'s kinda hard to
visualize, but there is a horizontal component to the gravitaional force
(the earth isn\'t a perfect sphere).  Since water is free to move (with
the earth is fairly rigid) it will do so until the horizontal components
due to the moon and earth sum to zero.  In an idealized all water model
even, the second lobe will still be there.  Hard to say in plain ascii,
grab an astro 101 type text just to see the force diagrams, it\'ll be a
little clearer.  Maybe with one less Guiness in me I could do a better
job :-)

When close to the Roche limit things get really wierd.  The Roche limit,
BTW, is the point at which the tidal forces are greater than self
gravitation... ie:  the moon comes apart.  Close to that, fluid bodies
(like contact binary stars) will distort greatly and hve massive lobes
going towards the center of mass.  I\'ve only seen models of this in
stars. I\'d say that really close systems are more of a special case than
other tides.

I\'ll read up and see if I can be more lucid :-)

Glad you like it. Credit Wildstar with the concept, me for testing and
embellishing.

A few notes on the GDW-Beta thread that lead to this:
     Folks were a little (understatement) annoyed with the FF&S crewing
rules for two reasons:

1) as gamemasters, having to deal with a lot more crew NPCs (for one
GM, NPC crew that he needed to keep track of on a Gazelle ballooned 
from 5 to 15);

2) the TNE background makes a big deal about how the highly integrated
and automated Imperial starships were plumb pickings for the Virus and
how New Era designs forced people into the loop for security, but never
distinguished between the high-security and low-security designs, as if
it didn\'t take more people to keep track of things when you\'re not letting
the computers do it for you.

So the HAIS thing isn\'t really a single system, but rather represents
the hi-capacity connectivity of the ship\'s systems, plus a number of
self-maintainence systems on board (dumbots to clean and maintain
conduits without having to open them up, remote servos to access hard-
to-reach systems, etc. The stuff that lets a ship almost run itself).
THIS would be the fundamental difference between the smart-ships of the 
Imperial era and the "intentionally lobotomized" ships of the New Era.
It also provided a rationale for the 3-4x difference in crew size.


Actually, I don\'t recommend using HAIS, at least not by itself, and here\'s
why:

[THE SHIP DESIGN FORUM IS NOW OPEN]

Everyone who\'s read the TML for a while knows many of us have 
problems with FF&S on a whole raft of issues. So many, in fact,
that coming up with individual alternate rules for each quibble 
winds up defeating the purpose of having a uniform design system --
so that each GM doesn\'t have to reinvent the wheel by his or herself
every time. If I make a ship using FF&S plus variant rules A, B, and C,
it cuts down on its usefulness to, say, Merrick, who may be using 
variants L, U, and Y. What makes more sense is for us either
to bite the bullet and use FF&S as is, or put our heads together
to come up with rules variant "packages" that we agree on
and can design with.

I\'d like to invite the various people designing ships and other systems 
to a "shipbuilding forum" on the GDW-Beta list (gdw-beta@quark.qrc.com)
to not only come up with rules variants more to our liking, but also
integrate them into "packages" that best suit the needs of GMs
in actual play.

...that also means I\'d like to hear from GMs and others on this list
about which rules in particular bug them (lurkers, pipe up!).
Suggestions can go here on the TML, the reason the forum
is on gdw-beta is because that is a better forum for arguing
nit-picking technical details without ballooning the size and
number of TML digests even further. The TML will get updates and
the packages when we\'ve hashed out something consistent.

I use "packages" in the plural because no one group of technical
assumptions will satisfy everybody. For instance, some people
agree with GDW\'s assumption of the implausibility of kinetic-impact
missiles, others don\'t (any defense can be overloaded). Still others
(or, at least, myself) don\'t buy GDW\'s line on this but don\'t 
think adding another layer of measure/countermeasure to the
design sequence brings much to actual gameplay.

Or in another area, I think far too many of GDW\'s decisions about
how shipboard technology worked (M-drives especially) for TNE
were decided on the basis of what would make Brilliant Lances an
interesting stand-alone game rather than on their effects on 
the role-playing environment. Thus, fuel-chomping M-drives add
a "bingo fuel" element to the boardgame at the expense of making
in-system travel much more complicated and time consuming,
and gas-giant refuelling almost pointless. 

Some people will agree with me on this, others will disagree.
What I\'d like to do is figure out what most people would be
interested in, and try to accomodate, rather than just burrowing
down into the hole that suits me best (and others finding their own
holes), and being nearly useless to each other.

Some issues that come to mind right off the bat:

--Kinetic-kill missiles (mentioned above)
--High-fuel-use M-drives (TNE) vs. negligible-fuel-use (CT and MT)
[the technobabble rationale is less important than the fuel-use issue]
--J-drive crew (anybody notice j-drives don\'t need crew?)
--Maintainence points, wear value, and crew (why don\'t MPs affect crew
requirements? If they did at least they would have SOME purpose!)
--Damper fields (mentioned in BL, but missing from FF&S)
--J-drive fuel use (nearly every ship has enough internal fuel for
two, somethimes even three jumps, often with enough leftover for 
a (brief) combat. This situation gets _really_ important if you switch
to low-fuel-use M-drives)
--laser limits to keep them from crowding out PAWs and MGs as
ships\' main weapons.
--non-linear PAWs and MGs, which might make them worthy bay-
weapons
--some distinction between highly automated Imperial-style ships 
vs. New Era-type architectures.
--asteroid hulls
--maintainence and assorted requirements of subsidiary vehicles
(hangers make maintainence easier, but can we be a little clearer
on this?)
--Life support endurance and supplies (the New Era DOES call
for time away from highly travelled spaceways, after all)
--Shops, sickbays, etc. (any requirements? Practical effects of
having them aboard? Or just a storage room with a nifty name?)
--Long-term maintainence (just what do those Free Traders do
to keep flying?)
--Mixed tech on ship (using UNIVAC to keep your nav-computer
running)


etc., etc., etc.

Hope to hear form you,

John Bogan

In my game I have forgotten totally about the grid. I rather like the idea
that a small part of the jumpdrive is formed like miniature of the starship,
with all attachments. From this miniature the jump field is radiated
outwards. There is no need to place this miniature in the middle of the
ship. More power is diverged to the sections of the miniature that are
further from the hull than other sections. Besides the minitaure doesn\'t
need to be large att all. Its power couplings (or whatever) just has to
withstand the power load that goes through it.

Beats me. Sort of like the argument over jump flashes. First, hyperspace
"jumps" do not exist (that we know of). It is a science fiction construct.
So if GDW says there are jump flashes, well, there are jump flashes. Or if
one hates the idea, simply ignore it. What\'s the big deal? It\'s just a game.
Unless one is playing in a tournament or other formal competition setting,
play it anyway you want, as long as the players know up front how its being
done.

First: sorry, when GDW talked about a "Slow Drug" in Treaveller, they 
really meant anagathics.

A Fast Drug, (Survival Margin, p. 94) "Speeds the passage of time 
subjective to the PC at the rate of 60-1.  Players with a large supple of 
this drug [426 60-day doses for 70 years] could rig a system to 
automatically dispense it to them for years at a time, or periodically 
wake up and re-administer it to themselves."

Note: time sppeded up to 60-1 would make a minute feel like a second, and 
an hour feel like a minute.  70 years would feel like about 11 years of time.

The following assumes that:
  - Current (1990s) genetic tech is actually at TL 9, including the 
    Genome Project
  - We obtain the ability to disable our aging gene by TL A
  - A serious population explosion occurs - aided and abeted by jump 
drives and terraforming capasity. (I believe that GDW serouisly 
underestimates high-tech terraforming ability, via nanites, bacteria, and 
even brute force)
  - Population stabilizes.
  - Since the immortals don\'t want to do certain jobs which risk their 
lives (They don\'t age, but bullets and radiation still do the job), 
mortals are soon recreated.
  - Mortals, like lower class peoples everywhere, soon vastly outnumbers 
their masters.  Their access to genetic modifications is very limited, 
and must be earned by service to the immortals (now, the Nobility).
  - The Nobility, of course, extensively modify themselves for beauty, 
strength and brains, becoming the very definition of The Beautiful People.

[Well, except for moral fibre.  An entire culture who think of themselves as 
gods -- and are built as such, at least in the traditional pagan view -- are 
likely to be far more deeply corrupt than anything we\'ve ever seen in 
history.  The sophisticated, racist, slave-owning Draka in Stirling\'s (?) 
books would be a good starting point.  His latest book, due to be 
published in January 1996 (of which the first three chapters are 
available on the web) starts off in about 2400, where immortal Draka 
(decendants of Afrikanerrs) rule over intelligent, mortal inferiors with 
a built-in slave mentality.]

In effect, the Third Imperium would be a Genetic Empire, much as the Zho\'s 
are a Psionic Empire. [And the RC promises to be a Human/AI combo]

Some changes would be severe: for example, Cleon I may still be 
ruling in 1116.  Others would be trivial: the Rebellion could have 
followed a very similar course to what it actually did. Still others 
would be quite unexpected: any society that can make manipulate genes 
to make itself immortal can probably grow ships, rather then have to 
build them the old-fashioned way.
  
There\'s several new avenues for PC\'s in this more realistic future.  They 
can be endlessly rebelling against the Nobility (almost every one of 
which has centuries of experience handling such rebellions). They can be 
High Nobles, trying to push mortal rights through various Moots.  Or Low 
Nobles, with some genetic modifications, but still forced to put 
themselves in life-threatening situations. (Nobles would only really trust 
Nobles to do certain things...)  They can be illegal genetic engineer\'s, 
doing modifications without a license (and on the run from the Ministry 
of Justice for the last 3 centuries).  They can be studying the Ancients: 
true, Imperials can control genetics perfectly, but the Ancients still 
have better control over physics and other "Hard sciences".

And yes, I feel that this is more realistic than the current Imperium, 
where Norris dies at age 96.  I mean, come on! Afer 3700 years of genetic 
research?!?  Even in the 20th century, American lifespans have grown 
form 60 to 90 years. (if for admittedly different reasons)

    'body' => 'I went back to the definitive classic Traveller source to get some
answers to the questions about jump-drives.  The TNE offical line
seems to be closer to the Miller JTAS article than DGP\'s Starship
Operator\'s Manual.   

All quotes are Marc Miller, "Jumpspace", JTAS 24.

ON LANTHANUM COILS AND HULL WIRES:

"Starship hulls contain as an integral part of their structure a 
 network of wiring which maintains the jump field around the ship.  
 Without this field, the natural physics of jump space would invade 
 the ship\'s interior. [...] Breaks in the protective network within 
 a starship hull are a primary cause of the loss of ships in jump."
 
"The jump coils that channel the jump energy within the drive are 
 constructed of lanthanum, a rare earth which has exactly the right 
 properties for the purpose. [...] Other materials have been used or 
 substituted, but none function with enough reliability or efficiency
 to make them practical."
 
Depicted as two separate systems, but both exist.  He doesn\'t say how
far the field extends *above* the wires, if any distance at all.  We
do know that some ships can carry small craft on the outside of the
hull, though (the Fat Trader and Azhanti come to mind).  I suspect the
"one meter" figure comes from a certain Travelleresque Star Wars novel
by Brian Daley, but I don\'t know for sure. 

ON TIME SPENT IN JUMPSPACE:

"...jump drive is accurate to less than one part in ten billion.
 [...] the arrival point of a ship can be predicted to within 
 perhaps 3000 kilometers."

"The duration of a jump is fixed at the instant jump begins, and 
 depends on the jump space entered, the energy input into the system, 
 and other factors."

"The exact time of emergence is usually predicted by the ship\'s 
 computer and the bridge is well-manned for the event."
 
To me, this suggests that the time a jump will take is an integral
part of the jump solution; the crew should be able to figure out
how long the jump will take to their chosen emergence point, given
their entrance point and vector.  This will also allow accurate
placement of the exit point so that the ship\'s outbound vector can
be used as an inbound vector on arrival, as Miller mentions is 
possible for military ships and high-speed couriers.

Incidentally, Book 2 implies that jumps can be pre-computed if you
know what your vector and jump-point will be -- pre-recorded, one-
use tapes are available for ships on the xboat routes that lack the 
jump-course Generate program.

COURSE PREDICTION BY OBSERVERS:

"...a ship\'s jump destination cannot be predicted."

But he also says that the entry vector and energy expenditure are
crucial to making a correct jump.  This is probably the Regency
Sourcebook\'s justification for mentioning that ships may be able
to guess destination if they have a hard target lock on the ship
entering jump.

EXIT/ENTRANCE "FLASH":

Miller mentions nothing, except that a lot of power is generated
at jump.  Regency Sourcebook mentions some gravitic disturbances
that are generated beginning several minutes before exit, but it
also says that they\'re short range and that the sensor operator
will need to be watching the right place to see them coming.  It
doesn\'t mention a visual light flash.  Most of the adventures I\'ve
seen seem to imply that you can tell the difference between an
unseen ship going active and a ship stepping out of jump.

BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS:

"The biological effects of jump on travellers is negligible."

However, he does mention the nausea in some that gets worse if the
ship misjumps, and at least one alien race had been established in
a previous JTAS article that was thought to be jump-intolerant.

This episode is not part of the CT/MT universe (which is why I\'m
cross-posting to the TML).

However, it does leave room for some interesting socio-ethical conflicts in
what looked like a simple mercenary ticket.  Imagine this:

The players are hired for a cadre ticket: training the \'settlers\' in
self-defense and small-unit tactics.  Equipment is high quality, their
students are motivated, the pay is good, and the mainstream media calls them
\'heroes\'.  This seems like a dream ticket, until they begin noticing that:

1) The wants of a few hundred settlers take precidence over the needs of a
few hundred thousand locals, which seems strangely non-democratic.

2) The settlers seem to have nothing but contempt for the locals and treat
them poorly, provoking responses that are then brutally suppressed.  Settler
provokation goes unpunished, indeed unrestrained.

Let the players see a few starving children, possibly meet a young girl
willing to do literally anything to feed her younger siblings (both parents
killed in riot, which the players know was provoked by extremist settlers). 
Then have the players called out in defense of a unit of settlers that has
been surrounded while demolishing native homes and fields.  Do they honour
their contract, or prevent the settler militia from machine-gunning children?
 Can they do both at the same time?

(This final action could even make an interesting Striker II game, with the
veteran mercenaries switching sides if they witness too many settler
atrocities.  Hm, the settler player must keep the mercenaries away from the
bloodiest fighting, so they don\'t switch sides, while tha native player must
try to have some units wiped out in front of the mercenaries so they will
switch sides.)

***Age of Faith?***

It would seem so, up to a point.  Of course, if there are no atheists in 
foxholes, then the Collapse would turn one to a raving fanatic, so it 
wouldn\'t be truly unexpected to any competent historian or sociologist.

Sign\'s of such a more spirtual attitude can be found in several New Era 
documents, ranging from the Ikthur (sp!) to the very intro to the main 
New Era rulebook, to "Faith" class cutters.

However, unlike other Ages of Faith, this era is not dominated by a 
single religion, or even a single metareligion (a la the Abrahamic faiths 
of the Middle Ages).  It does seem to be related to a grim realization of 
how valuable sentient life is, and how fragile the ties of civilization 
are.  It\'s also related to basic hope, and even love (note the new 
"nurturing" philosophy of the Regency, vs. the "hands off" attitude of 
the classic Imperium.)  Finally, it\'s related to the concept of 
self-sacrifice for the sake of others, and for the future. 

And God/Christianity?  Well, His name does show up now and again (just 
try to find it in the Imperial Era!  I dare you!), and Christianity 
has been heard of, at least.  However, it isn\'t usually tied to a 
particular doctrine (there are exceptions).  And some folk do believe in 
the afterlife, including Norris (Surprise!).

One very interesting varient of this "Age of Faith" is it\'s lack of 
tolerance for permitting it to become tyrranic.  Both the RC and 
the Regency are willing to play with local doctrine to obtain beneficial 
results (and undermine tyrranical theocracies).  This is in contrast to 
the Imperium, who didn\'t care what you believed or did to your citizens 
as long as the taxes kept coming in.  Which attitude is more respectful to 
religious beliefs?  Which is more contemptous?

Both the Regency and RC are willing to "interfere" to promote a 
particular ideology.  Well, maybe not "ideology", maybe it should be 
called a universal goal, or a belief: ideology is basically a perjogative 
(sp!) word in English, and both beliefs seem basically good, 
compassionate, and brave. (Although the RC, being in a more harsher 
environment, tends to act in a harsher fashion)

***Imperialistic flavours***

Boththe Regency and RC  are expansionistic: the RC because it must, for 
psychological/economic reasons; the Regency, due to the economy/military 
security (and population, thanks to Zho immigration).  The Regency is 
closer to  "European Imperialism" in it\'s willingness to annex small 
independent nations: geopolitics is a major factor in it\'s behaviour.

The RC is more "American Imperialistic" in it\'s drive to annex everything 
in sight, due to economic reasons and local version of Manifest Destiny.

Technology supremacy also flavours each nation\'s economic drive: The RC 
usually has immense tech supremacy, but has very few people to waste.  
The Regency is also technologically dominant, but not to such an extent 
as RC vs. TEDs.  The Regency also has a much larger population, and can 
afford to have more Unfortunate Incidents then the RC can.

Both versions of imperialism is shaped by anti-virus attitudes: however, 
the RC is soon going to make certain forms of Virus it\'s friend, while 
the Regency sees the AI Virus as a fiend to be completely eradicated.

Both versions of imperialism will have to deal with unhappy locals: they 
will initally loathe both RC\'s emphasis on technology, and the Imperial 
Sunburst on Regency helmets.  The loathing of RC tech may or may not 
weaken with time: I have already dealt with possible Regency responses in 
a previous post.

A major factor in Regency expansion - and the \'flavour\' of a reborn of the 
Third Imperium - is the primary tool of Regency expansion. Basically, 
will the Regency deal with antiImperial systems by
 - drowning their worlds with Regency populations 
 - use economic and technological supremacy to buy off opposition
 - use Zho "though police" methods, as well as Imperial psychohistory 
   techniques (and good old propaganda) to gut opposition
 - simply insure that no anti-Imperial world get\'s past TL 8
 - give up and go home

[Note: it\'s quite likely that the fourth imperium will be actually called 
the Third Imperium, as Regency folk consider\'s themselves Third Imperium 
citizens.]

***Honour***

"Keeping the Flame" is viewed as comprising of courage, stewardship, 
selfless service, and inclusiveness.  Honour is implicitly included (in 
"Courage"), but isn\'t as dominant as it used to be.

...and yet.  Honour can be defined as "speaking the truth when it hurts": 
the new Regency policy of governmental openess can certainly be considered 
more honourable than the classic Imperium\'s secrecy.  Moreover, the Zho\'s
truthfulness may revolutionize Imperial notions of honour, as would an 
increase of Aslan influence, thanks to our new Aslan citizens.

***Regret***

It seem\'s that the Zho\'s are in deep trouble, and may not last to 1300.  
They have been a worthy advesary, and are worth a salute.

If the Consulate falls to whatever is destroying it internally, it would 
be a likely site for the first major interstellar theocracy...

Integral.  The near-side lobe is caused by the gravity of the companion
object (hereafter abreviated as "moon").   The far side lobe is caused by
the fact that 
the earth and moon co-revolve around a point which is NOT at the centre of
the earth -- the far side is the result of centrifugal force.

Its is caused by ROTATION not REVOLUTION so, it would remain.

It\'s always there: a tidaly locked world, of course, would not have "tides"
in the sense of a change in water level - the points in line with the
companion are always at high water, the points 90 degrees away are always at
low.

The way to eliminate tidal buldges it to increase the seperation between the
companions.

Just a minor point.  The gains you are referring to in American lifespans
are increases in average life expectancy.  Thus, it\'s not that people live
longer, it is that MORE people live longer.  This is very different from
extending life.

Someone previously complained about the extensive government role that 
the Regency has in it\'s managed economy: I myself do not find the 
current economics of the Regency troubling. 

The results of the \'forced modernization\' program - the tech upgrading of 
about 20 systems, about 2-3 tech levels - is not out of line with 
reality.  This would cause the economic boom described in the main TNE 
book, as TL = waealth.  However, the economic bust would also logically 
result, as this expensive tech upgrading would be financed by increased debt 
(That the Regency may find difficult to manage) and increased taxes 
(which would inhibit financial growth).

The Zhodani refugees may not be the only motivation to resettle the 
Wilds: the taxation levels alone may be sufficent, assuming that the 
Regency offers tax breaks to settle out there.

   It\'s easy to overlook, don\'t sweat it.  I suggest taking another look at:
a.   knockdown rules
   If a character takes more damage than their agility score in a round, 
they are \'knocked down\', and can not take an action that round.

b.   Quick Kill rules
    If a character take a hit to the head or chest, roll a d10, if the roll
is less than the damage rating of the weapons, wave bye-bye.
    The rules say that NPC\'s are dead, and PC\'s are in a very bad way.
Flavor to your taste.

c.  Head shot rules
    I forget the exact working, but there is a chance of \'knocking out\' a
character shot in the head, that is, if they survive the quick kill rules.

This discussion regarding jump grids vs. jump coils confuses me. We don\'t know
why GDW approved the Starship Operator\'s Manual; maybe they had to contract-
wise. What difference does it really make except for those who want to nitpick?
it\'s GDW\'s game; they can change it if they want. Ships still enter jump space
in TNE. I\'m sorry, but I fail to see the relevance.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Well, I submit that GDW, for one, must care about it more than a little. 
Otherwise, why did they go to the trouble of specifically doing away with
what went before? And sure it\'s their\'s & they can mess it up as they see
fit. But it\'s also my considerable investment that they\'re messing up at
the same time. Which is mine to complain about, as I see fit.

Phil
p.s. In the end the only way most of us have of influencing GDW is to 
negatively review their efforts & hope they change. These mailing lists
help facilitate that.

Do you mean that it\'s a mistake that the interdicts have not been removed
or that it\'s a mistake to have C starports on interdicted worlds? If I
remember correctly Andor and Candory have always had C starports. I always
interpreted this to mean that the Droyne of Andor had jump-1 starships of
their own and had colonies on Candory. (I\'ve also assumed that the Droyne
themselves are free to come and go as they please and that the interdict
only applies to outsiders (Note that there is a Droyne Free Trader from
Andor mentioned in "Merchants")).

The increased TLs does seem to indicate that they are changing their
age-old way of life. It\'s interesting that Candory has reached a higher TL
than Andor. Hmmm... that\'s going to take a bit of explaining.

Damn! You beat me to it; I still haven\'t gotten around to rewriting
my Classic Traveller vampires to TNE. I wanted to improve them with
some ideas from my writing, anyway. 

I did it slightly differently.. my vampires are the result of a
recombinant-DNA virus, distantly related to HIV. You get infected,
it slowly rebuilds you, and incidently damages your immune system
(ever notice how people in novels that are bitten by vampires but
not killed never seem to live to old age, anyway?). However, the
on/off switch on the gene mods is, well, clinical death and loss
of oxygen supply to the cells...

Oh, yeah, and for some reason dying tends to activate latent
psionic abilities... thus many of the so-called "supernatural" 
abilities of the vampire. (Actually, the difference between psi
and the supernatural is a matter of definitions). 

Some day I\'ll get around to writing them up for TNE again; right
now I\'m busy writing them down for publication (someday, I hope!).
Some day, I\'ll surprise some group of PCs with them.

BTW, why NPC villains, Commander X?  Why not NPC patrons? After all,
in a high-tech society, one doesn\'t need to run around ripping 
people\'s throats out to get blood.  And with sentient aliens about,
surely vampires long ago got over that "It\'s okay to kill people,
they\'re only mortals and not our kind anyway" mentality too many of
the 20th century ones seem to have.  (Most of alt.vampyres would
fail Basic Interstellar Relations 101...)

Les Howie and James Kundert have been talking about tidal effects 
lately, and I had to add my .02..

Actually, this is not quite true.  Tides are caused by differential 
gravitational attraction; i.e., the pull of gravity is varies with distance
from the attracting object.  The fact that attraction varies in an inverse
square relationship makes the difference from one side of the world to the 
other.

>Its is caused by ROTATION not REVOLUTION so, it would remain.

Both lobes are caused by differential attraction.  If you consider the 
center of the planet as being attracted by a value of 1, then the closest 
side to the attracting body is pulled at a value greater than 1, and the 
side opposite at something less than 1.  This places the maximum tidal
bulges facing and opposite the attracting mass.  The reason for the far side
bulge is not that the water is pulled in the other direction, but that the planet
is being pulled out from under the water, which is attracted less.
(note - all these things apply equally to water and the planetary crust 
itself - planetary crust just is more rigid and doesn\'t react as quickly
as water)

A tidally locked world would probably have some "tides" caused by the minor 
peterbations in the it\'s orbit in relation to the attracting body.  They 
would generally be less than regular earth type tides.

You should also check out the appendecis of Forward\'s books - he does a pretty
good job with tidal effects there.  Also Asmiov\'s book "Extra-Terrestrial 
Civilization" and Neil Comin\'s "What if the moon didnt exist" both deal with
the subject.  It\'s a pretty fascinating subject, and would determine the shape
of many worlds in Imperial space.

        TNE _IS_ a dark setting, but if you fall back to MT, you go from
TNE (marginal) TL-17 down to MT TL-16 (lossing 10+ trillion people is,
I feel, a bit too dark, though).
 
  Now assuming have thought about compressing it via antimatter, to compress:

                                or!.....

  kg antimatter needed =  2.6 * 10^-13 * [kg mass of H2 sphere] ^9

1 kg antimatter = .625 Mcr (MT quote)
   This compresses the H2 1 million fold. The H2 sphere __MUST__ be
completely precooled to <100 kelvin (see below).

        yep.....I said kg^9! ouch.......

        This is good for compressing fuel. It MAY be good for a warhead,
but you would have to find a way to heat it to 10^8 kelvin (nuclear damper in
reverse??) Pressure is very important to the H1+H1 fusion reaction, but the
temperature must be about 10^8 K (the entire mass, that is) for it to start.
Since PV=NRT, a sphere at <100 K compressed 10^6 fold would produce a
compressed T of <10^8 K...safe (this is a relative term!)
        A thin shell of antimatter compress the H2, then another shell 
forms
a diamond \'coating\' from a thick carbon source to keep it stable. It 
then
needs ~6 weeks cooling with a nuke damper to keep H+H reaction down in 
the
condenced matter \'blob\'. A nuclear damper after that time period is NOT
needed.

    On the subject of oort clouds, I have a few ideas on how to build a 
station that won\'t be found:

    o Black globes (Factor 1, to decrease local temperature, IR should 
be the main way to find a station, beside:
    o Grav generators (to negate gravity signature of the asteroid and 
station gravity, which can be detected lond distance)
    o EMM (for shipborne stealth, see below)
    o Methane compounds (use as a degraded EMM, for stealth on the 
cheap. For surface of asteroids)
    O Quantum stealth (decrease number of photons emitted by increasing 
their average energy. VERY hard and of questionable usefullness: An 
opponent can\'t find you they dont absorb many photons from your 
station. This is essentially EMM, but can be developed more (tech 
sensitive.)
    o Heat storage and dump at a non-visible place (liq H2 evaporation)
    o Jump1 capable mega-ships (absorbs asteroids for fuel, lower IR 
signature)

    Please, email me with ideas/suggestions:)    Nrunner

1.      DROYNE RENAISSANCE

In digest 474, Alvin said that the following was an error:

Why is this an error? I\'ve always assumed the the interdiction was only for
non-Droyne. I don\'t think that Droyne are excluded from their own worlds.
Remember that the Navy OR the IISS can interdict a world. Perhaps the
interdiction has been requested by the Droyne themselves, to only allow local
Droyne to leave and return from the systems.

The next nearest Droyne system is Auitowry (sp?) in the Rift, which is TL 15.
If you want Droyne PC\'s (or even NPC\'s), they have to come from somewhere.
Candor and Andory are the best choices.

Note that both are Ancient sites. maybe the interdict is to protect these
areas - and remember that no-one in the Regency knows where Eskayloyt (SP?)
- the Droyne\'s Lost Home - is. They *think* that it could be A or C - and are
taking no chances on artifact weapons ending up in the wrong hands.

2.      HULL GRIDS AND THE JUMP SHIP CONCEPT

In digest 472, Charles Collin said:

>For those wanting to carry ore strapped to the outside, you need a big
>lanthanum net (I remember seeing an illustration of this somewhere...).

The illustration is from _Supplement 9: Fighting Ships_. A craft known as a
"Jump Ship" is shown on pp 22-23. The design notes say:

"Comments: The jump ship is designed to provide maximum flexibility in
interstellar transportation. As built, it is capable of jump-6 and 1-G. Special
field cables attached to the rear of the ship extend the ship\'s jump field to
include this additional cargo. Alterations in displacement will affect the size
of the jump itself, but the amount of cargo carried can be varied to fit the
needs."

"Capabilities: For each 1,000 tons of cargo carried in the mesh cables behind
the ship, jump is decreased by one. Thus, if the 5,000-ton ship carries 1,000
tons behind it, it can only perform jump-5. If it carries 5,000 tons behind it,
it can only perform jump-1. In all cases, the internal fuel tankage of the ship
(3,300 tons) is sufficient to support the jump."

"Jump Pods: The jump ship can transport valuable raw ores, planetoid chunks, and
other materials directly in its jump mesh. Only durable goods can be carried in
this manner because they are exposed directly to the vacuum of space."
"To allow the transport of other materials, jump pods have been constructed in a
variety of designs. Typically, each displaces 1,000 tons and can function
independently of the jump ship. Some basic designs for jump pods include the
following:"
"Cargo Pod: A bulk carrier displacing 1,000 tons and carrying approximately 950
tons of cargo. Several varieties are available, including special liquid
tankers, bulk food or grain carriers, and compartmented transport containers.
MCr 100."
"Passenger Pod: A large pressurised hull with 225 staterooms, plus recreational
facilities, safety compartmentalisation, and fittings for comfort. MCr 212.5."
"Low Pod: Similar to a passenger pod, the low pod is fitted with 1900 low berths
for carrying people or animals long distances. MCr 195."

"Additional types of pods are available, and have probably been produced
somewhere in the Imperium."
_Supplement 9: Fighting Ships_, GDW, USA, 1981, p22.

I have always assumed the following:
  - the cables are lanthanum-doped and act as an extension of the hull grid;
  - the jump pods have their own integral hull grid (as Charles agreed) plus
their own power supply in case of failure of either the jump ship\'s power or the
umbilical conection to the pod, AND so that they can be swapped around in orbit.

...and despite what GDW alters, you can go on diong what you want to in your own
campaign. Isn\'t that why they allowed all those "alternate technologies" into
the FF&S book??!!

Where\'s the error?  Supplement 3, The Spinward Marches, 
listed those Droyne worlds as interdicted, yet possessed of 
tech levels and starports.  Book 7, Merchant Prince, 
describes Thyo Supud, a Droyne free trader "formed by a 
Droyne kroyloss ... from Andor."  (Book 7 at 9.)  The 
interdiction of the Droyne worlds has always seemed to keep 
non-Droyne out, not to keep Droyne in.  Why wouldn\'t the 
Droyne improve their situation during the rebellion and 
collapse?

In my understanding the lanthanum (barium, whatever) grid was 
essentially a "conductor" along which you channelled energy from your 
jump drives - the pattern of the energy when combined with tech-level 
and the *amount* of energy  altered the \'weave\' of j-space that you 
entered.  While in j-space there was a \'jump-field\' which extends 
approximately 1 meter from the grid.  Anything outside of this 
j-field was then subject to the laws of j-space... could be 
practically anything, and you only have to read up on the "privileged 
communication channels," or possibly even Greg Bear\'s "Moving Mars" 
to get some novel possibilities.

However, the gist is that the grid maintained a field around the 
ship which protected it from the altering physical laws (reduced 
linear measurements, changes of physical constants, photons acquiring 
mass [nasty], that sort of thing).  Since the field is maintained 
through the journey I always presumed that there was some form of 
constant energy input from the main power plant, or possibly the 
effects of energising the grid left some form of residual \'charge\' 
which maintained the field.  If this is the case then why not simply 
extend the grid over a foreign object.  Modular transports would have 
a "standard" j-grid and each module would have it\'s own j-grid which 
\'attaches\' to the other... maybe there\'s even a change in the shape 
(more swirls or something instead of the \'regular\' _grid_).  The ship 
is therefore able to operate independently *and* with other 
attachments.  

As for GDW "getting rid of" the lanthanum hull network, is it really 
that important?  As long as you follow through upon the implications 
of this then everything is fine.  Personally I like the 
hull-network... it kind of looks pretty in the mind when you imagine 
a ship going into j-space.  Also, the "physics" of it seems more 
consistent (the grid contains the \'matrix\' of matter that is the 
ship?).  What is the problem, though, of getting rid of it.  So, you 
no longer get pretty lights?  You do, however, get rid of the 
problems of \'superficial\' damage to the hull rendering several 
thousand tons of mega-credit ship impotent when it can\'t enter 
j-space... "ooops, sorry, we can\'t repair the network - dead duck, 
anyone?"  To close (almost), doesn\'t it all depend upon the desires 
of the GM?  Wasn\'t that the whole point to FF&S?  

Finally, could someone tell me where they actually mentioned that the 
hull grid was no longer in existence... am I missing something from 
the FF&S or BL products?

BIG BIG BIG BIG Biiiiig difference. How do you prevent a ship from jumping?
Got a Jump grid? Ok, hit it with ship lasers, dynamite it from the inside or
outside. No jump grid.... errr... you mean we gotta go find some tiny
lanthanum coil somewhere in the drive room and that\'s the _only_ way to
knock out the ship\'s jump drive? (Ok, so there\'s all the super-fast fusion
reactor which actually powers it and so on, but you get my drift...)

So, a ship\'s vulnerability to jump drive damage is DRASTICALLY altered
depending on which load of nonsense-change-it-every-other-week-for-no-reason
that GDW is currently spouting...

"If it ain\'t broke, don\'t fix it." Why is it _so_ hard to grind this into
some game designers\' heads?

According to World Builder\'s Handbook, \'special\' TL\'s aren\'t part of the 
listed UWP Tech level: the listed UWP TL is the \'high common\' level.

First, how can a world be interdicted and have a starport?
Second, why should such a stable people such as the Droyne raise their TL 
so drastically, so quickly, in so short a time? (Neither system is part 
of the Regency Industrial Development Program)

> If I remember correctly Andor and Candory have always had C starports.

I think you\'re right: however, I never really thought about the 
contradition between starports and red zones till just now.

The mystery get\'s deeper and deeper...
(AND their governemnt changed, from a oligarchy to the traditional Droyne 
hierarchy.  Whatever that is...)

I doubt if GDW is going to go into this: any RICE men out there that 
want\'s to take this on?

You may be right-on: I have never heard of this, however. Someone with a

Again, possibly correct: but why the starports if they want to Red Zone it?  
Unless your statement on Droyne being able to cross the Red Zone is 
correct, of course...

OK: the data pre-rebellion is correct: both worlds have always had a C 
port.  However, how can they have a starport, when all Red Zoned worlds 
are forbidden from having starports?  If the Imperium/Regency want\'s to 
keep Droyne worlds isolated, and reduce the chance of any \'leakage\' of 
possible Doomsday weapons, why should they allow any contact at all?  
Droyne trade in Artifact material is just as dangerous as human trade... 

Apparently, the Droyne can improve their situation from the pre-Rebellion 
period: the question is, why now?  Apparently with their \'racial memory\' 
- and their ability to hand-build jump drives, according to rumour - they 
could have had a nice empire going, say, 10,000 years after the Final War.
Instead, they maintain their (usually) low TL\'s, and live comfortabily in 
other people\'s Galatic Empires.  Why the sudden change, in the current 
post-Holocaust environment - after all, the Droyne have seen far worse, but 
didn\'t strive to improve their TL standard.

The Great Exception to all this is Auitowry, a major TL F Droyne world 
out there in the Trojan Reach (I think).  Why Auitowry?

RE:     LEWIS

I, for one, was sorry that the world Lewis/Aramis has already been detailed. I
*liked* the new description - as someone stated before, these sort of worlds are
needed to balance out all the "happy happy" worlds. After all, the
Imperium/Regency is supposed to be made up of humans - there MUST be a few
skeletons in the Regency closet (human or otherwise ;-). After all, if the
Imperium could produce people such as Lucan and Dulinor, it is *NOT* the happy
place that the Star Trek UFP is (and note that in DS9, we are beginning to see
"behind the scenes" even there).

Please find somewhere else to put your world, Lewis. Personally, I don\'t
remember any references to Gerome and Huderu - although I haven\'t quite
memorised the Spinward Marches Campaign book, there may be something in there
(or on "Twilight\'s Peak") - I\'ll see if I can find anything. BTW, those worlds
are closer to Rhylanor, and so may be better for high-tech research - not so
far to travel. On the other hand, maybe you would put secret facilities far
away, to avoid detection. Up to you!

Any ideas out there for what areobraking would be like in BL?  What

Well I was actually referring to influencing them to change, which doesn\'t
seem very likely, I\'ll admit, esp. considering the loooong string of RPG-
related miscalculations, starting with T:2000 or so, that GDW has commit-
ted. In fact it seems that the only big score they\'ve had has been CT.

I\'ve been running Traveller since Classic Traveller days, when Lanthanum 
coils were used. I dont remember if I ever saw this written down, but I\'ve 
always assumed that the Lanthanum coils were capacitors which were used to 
store the energy until it was used to trigger the jump.

This explained the length of time it took to prepare for jump (charging the 
capacitors), and gave my player characters a big incentive not to change 
their minds about jumping halfway through the charging process (can you say 
BOOM!....?).

I also assumed that, due to the amount of energy required (not being a 
physicist, I based my guess on the proportion of fuel used), the capacitors 
are enormous. That explains what takes up all that space in drive rooms (not 
to mention leaving excellent possibilities for \'hunt the mad bomber in the 
drive room\' adventures - anyone see \'Hunt for Red October\'?).

So it\'s not a case of finding one little coil, but just checking whether the 
capacitors are charged before you begin trying to destroy them (or else 
BOOM! again), which gets round your next point Andy.

Yes. That one.....

I never bought into the jump grid idea purely for the reasons mentioned in 
this list (i.e. some loony in the starport fires a shotgun at your starship, 
and that\'s you grounded until the shipyard has a dock free to perform the 
repairs).

Hope this helps (or fans the fires, or whatever...)

    'body' => 'Hi.  Several messages (e.g., "Who cares?") have come through saying that 
the question of grids vs. coils is immaterial.  Of course this is true in 
a larger sense, but the question does have some relevance in terms of 
game play.  If ships do have a jump grid which lights up on exit/entrance 
to jump, several possibilities emerge:

1) You can detect ships much more easily as they jump in or out, and may 
be able to tell their size or other characteristics.
2) You may be able to tell where/how far they are jumping based on the 
pattern of grid activation.
3) A ship may be rendered incapable of jump or at least hampered even by 
minor damage (tears in the jump grid and the like).
4) Jump grids have implications for carrying strap-on cargo and modules.
5) etc.

As a GM, this can be important.  For instance, players ask "Can\'t we just
strap the ore to the outside of the ship?" and you say "No." and they ask
"Why not?"  You have to have some "canon" to fall back on.  Having
agreement on background details like this makes problem-solving by the
characters that much more interesting.  And the GM doesn\'t look like he\'s 
just arbitrarily handing down pronouncements.

Of course, as always, you can do whatever you want in your own universe.  
I think the debate here is simply to iron out what the canon from GDW is, 
how they\'ve changed it (if they\'ve changed it?), and what the relative 
merits/flaws of the old/new canon are.

There, my diplomatic deed for the day!  :)

Hi,

Firstly can I say thanks to everyone who answered my
request for information on what happened to the GDW
universe in the years I missed out on.  Busy times...

I\'ve been reading all the back copies of the mailing
list on the server, and I\'ve come across a few things
which sound interesting, but which I don\'t know much
about: Grandfather, the Sparklers/Primordials, and
Longbow.  Any enlightenment would be gratefully
received.

Thanks

Iain

Notes:

The Interstel I-1102 General Purpose Scout ubiquitous throughout the
Solomani Confederation and adjoining areas, serving much the same purpose as
the Imperial Type S Scout/Courier.  The I-1102 is an evolutionary design,
building on the TL-13 I-1101 and the TL-12 I-1100.  The original design has
it\'s origin in a series of TL-10 and 11 scout ships produced for the United
Nations / Terran Confederation during the Interstellar Wars.  The current
version of the venerable Solomani Scout entered service shortly after the
Solomani Patriotic War (Solomani Rim War), gradually replacing the I-1101 in
active service over the next century.  The craft is also popular with
private organisations, particularly corporations seeking an inexpensive
courier / executive transport.

The I-1102 was produced in huge numbers by the Solomani Confederation, and
saw extensive service during the Retribution War (aka 2nd Rim War, Solomani
Invasion) from 1117.  This ship, and the \'Victrix\' class multipurpose sloop
are by far the most common relic ships to be found in the New Era in the
areas once held by the Solomani Confederation, the sheer numbers produced
ensuring the survival of some ships following the Collapse.

IN NEAR BOOTES COMMONWEALTH SERVICE

The Near Bootes Commonwealth operates a number of these craft - their high
tech communications and sensor equipment are prized by planetary and
Commonwealth organisations alike.  The Solomani Scout is the vessel most
likely to be encountered beyond the Commonwealth\'s borders, operated by the
CEF or freelancers in the employ of the Commonwealth.

Stauffenburg und Warne, a small shipbuilder on Aquitaine, plans to restart
production of the I-1102, using TL-12 equipment where needed.  The first
example was laid down on 057-1102, and is expected to be completed by year\'s
end.

IN REFORMATION COALITION SERVICE

Much of the Reformation Coalition was either part of the Solomani
Confederation, or taken from the Imperium by the Confederation during the
Final War.  It is not surprising, therefore, that many examples of the
I-1102 can be found in service within and adjoining Coalition space.  The
Reformation Coalition itself eschews the use of these ships, using more
advanced Imperial Type S Scout/Courier\'s instead.  Various planetary
governments (particularly the Oriflammen and Balduri) and private
organizations do possess I-1102\'s.
The I-1102 is also found as Free Trader and Guild starships, and a number of
Vampire I-1102\'s have been sighted on the Vampire Highway.

IN THE REGENCY

Unsurprisingly, the I-1102 is almost unknown in the Regency (it\'s a long way
to Tipperary!).

VARIANTS

Variations on the I-1102 design are too numerous to mention fully.  One of
the more unusual modifications is the I-1102/D \'Fin Scout\', modified for use
by dolphin crews.  The Belter Scout is another common modification, and is
similar to the \'Seeker\' variant of the Type S Imperial Scout.  The I-1102/EX
is a downgraded \'civil\' version of the scout, with shorter ranged sensors
and lacking the EM masking equipment of the standard scout (shaving MCr 15
off of the ship\'s price).

Many examples in service with the Solomani Navy mounted missile launchers in
place of the laser turret.  The lack of available ordinance today has seen
most of these examples retrofitted with laser weaponry.  Another variant in
Naval service was the I-1102/I.  Used for electronic intelligence gathering,
the turret was replaced by a variety of installable listening and
surveillance gear.

Beyond the Imperial/Regency border, Pequan lies at the rimward edge of the
Jewell Sector.  Pequan\'s major interest to the outside universe is it\'s
status as the primary supplier of agricultural products in the Federation of
Arden, and the site of a rather ugly insurgency against the ruling government.

Pequan was believed to have been initially settled by Daryen colonists
travelling in sublight starships circa -1800.  The colony failed sometime
afterwards, for reasons that have never been determined.  The only remaining
legacies of Daryen settlement are the colony ruins in the southern
hemisphere, and the Daryen nomenclature of system contents in some charts.

The next wave of settlement took place around 100, when a group of agrarian
colonists from the Massila Sector established a colony on the Armament
Islands.  The colony has never been a member of the Imperium, and was
largely bypassed by the ebb and flow of events in the Spinward Marches.  The
Zhodani Consulate attempted to subvert the world into it\'s sphere of
influence before the Third Frontier War, but these overtures were
subsequently rejected.  Pequan did not assume any importance on the galactic
stage until after the Fifth Frontier War (1107-1112).  During the peace
talks that concluded the war, Pequan\'s government refused to become a part
of the Federation of Arden.  

Pequan\'s ruling council of landowners was overthrown after a civil war in
1124.  The new rulers nationalised all major land and industrial holdings,
and set out to build their version of the worker\'s state.  The unseated
rulers fought back, initially without success.  They enlisted aid from the
Federation of Arden, and after much bloody fighting, toppled the Pequan
Worker\'s Party in 1130.  The Federation annexed Pequan, but reinstated the
landowners as the ruling class on the world.  They continue to rule today,
despite a continued guerilla and terrorist campaign by the PWP aimed at
their overthrow.  Local military forces are re-inforced by Arden Army and
mercenary units.

An automated beacon provides navigational information for starships jumping
into the Pequan system.  This is one of the few concessions to space travel
provided by the Pequani, starport facilities are primitive.  The Arden
Federal Navy conducts irregular sweeps of the system, but travellers are
advised to look to their own defenses - piracy is not unheard of, and the
Arden Navy is rather inneffectual.

Pequan Starport (a facility hardly deserving of the title) is located on
Black Powder island, on the southernmost tip of the Armament Archipelago.
There are no repair or refuelling facilities at the starport - refuelling is
performed by skimming fuel from the adjacent ocean.  The landing pad
consists of two hectares of cleared and packed dirt.  A customs and
administration building provides the government representation.  The other
buildings include representative offices for merchant concerns, barracks for
the starport security contingent and a small bar (the \'Pequan Down\').
Starport security is handled by government troops armed for the most part
with indigenous TL-4 weaponry.
On landing, the starport security personnel will conduct a search of
arriving starships, aimed primarily at heading off the steady inflow of arms
sold to the PWP rebels.

Travellers should note that the Regency Credit is not legal tender on
Pequan.  The local currency is the Ardeni Scrip, officially valued at 0.32
Cr.  The black market exchange rate is more accurate:  one Regency Credit
will currently buy 6 Scrip.  Dealing in Regency scrip outside the starport
compound is illegal, and punishable by a lengthy prison term.  Nonetheless,
the Credit is popular with the locals.  The carriage of any form of weaponry
outside the compound is also illegal - and can be punishable by death.

Merchants seeking to do business on Pequan really don\'t need to leave the
starport area. The co-operative offices routinely arrange the sale and
transshipment of cargo, and are easier to deal with than most government
officials, who have a dislike of foreigners.

The Pequan Air Transport Corporation maintains a weekly air service between
the starport and the capital city on Six Pounder Island (400 km northeast of
Black Powder Island).  The aircraft lands and departs from a grassed
airstrip at the edge of the starport compound. The ride takes about 100
minutes, and costs AS500 (Cr 160).  Travellers are advised to swallow their
pride and take the airplane - local authorities have an intense dislike for
privately operated grav vehicles, mainly due to their risk to local
security.  Local and Arden military patrols have been known to \'confiscate\'
vehicles.

As the aircraft descends towards Pequan City Commercial Airfield, one can\'t
help but notice the generally decrepit state of the city.  Pequan City (pop.
115,000) is the capital and administrative centre of Pequan, and is also a
centre for what manufacturing industries exist on this non-industrialized
world.  On most days, a dirty haze hangs over the city, pollution caused
mainly by coal burning and the exhaust from petroleum-fuelled ground cars.
The city still bears the scars of the civil wars that swept then toppled the
PWP, many buildings are only roughly patched or repaired.  A rail service
links the airfield to the city centre, some 8 kilometers distant.

Don\'t expect to be welcomed with open arms.  The locals are wary of
outsiders, an attitude enforced by officialdom.  In the cities especially,
the government keeps a close eye on it\'s subjects, and an even closer eye on
offworlders.  Before you leave the airfield, you will have picked up a
\'tail\' - an operative from the Bureau of Internal Affairs assigned to keep
watch on your movements.  Despite the Federation\'s reputation as \'neutral
ground\' for offworlders, the local rulers have a deep distrust of
offworlders, especially those from the Regency.

The local law level is harsh, banning weapons outside the home, and all
firearms and energy weapons.  An active paramilitary police force patrols
the streets of every major town.  It\'s members are armed (with TL-4
equipment), if not particularly well trained.  The police have wide reaching
powers, including the ability to arbitrarily arrest individuals and hold
them without trial indefinately.  These powers are exercised regularly in
the face of continued acts of sabotage and terrorism by the PWP.  Corruption
in the legal and judicial system is endemic.

The government\'s control of the countryside is less secure, and some
\'outback\' areas are effectively controlled by the rebels.  Irregular sweeps
are made by government security forces, backed by offworld aircraft and
heavy weaponry when possible - these sweeps generally do little more than
further embitter an already impoverished peasantry, although they are
occasionally ambushed by rebel irregular forces.  Offworlders are advised to
stay away from the countryside - hostage taking by rebel forces is not
unknown.  If it were a member if the Regency, Pequan would probably be
occupied by Regency peacekeepers, or at the very least declared an Amber Zone.

Still, Pequan does offer some opportunity - gun running to the rebels can be
a lucrative, if risky trade.  In the authors opinion, the potential for loss
outweighs that for profit, and there are many less potentially fatal ways
for a traveller to make a quick credit.

Simple.  Shoot any ship except the authorized ones.  Interdiction doesn\'t
mean no starport - it means no legal access (which is something vey
different).

Either the Navy or the IISS can interdict a world.  The Navy usually does it
for security reasons, the Socuts to protect local cultures or resources. 
Thus, you could easily have a pair of starfaring worlds interdicted to all
except local traffic to protect the local (Droyne) culture from interference.
 Which is what I always assumed was the case.

They aren\'t prohibited.  When randomly generating worlds that\'s the way it
works, but that\'s only for random generation.

Why shouldn\'t they?  Pogroms, great and frightening changes, and so on. 
Maybe the coynes told them to change.  (Remember the approaching wavefront?) 
Past stability doesn\'t guarantee future stability, and stability doen\'t
necessarily mean stasis.

Surely that depends on the terms of the interdict. Note that there are
at least two different kinds of interdicts: System interdicts and planet
interdicts. If only the planet is under interdict the people can freely
visit and use other planets in the system, but the planet cannot be 
visited (and have no need of a starport. If the entire system is under
interdict then interstellar traffic is a no-no, but interplanetary
traffic could be ok - in which case they could have a starport. In the
case of Andor and Candory it\'s my opinion that the two systems are
interdicted as a unit - which means that the Droyne at the very least
have permission to travel back and forth between the two systems (I
also think they are allowed to travel to and from the rest of the
Imperium, but I admit that such would require a less than usually
severe interdict).

>Second, why should such a stable people such as the Droyne raise their TL

>of the Regency Industrial Development Program)

The pertinent part of that question is why they decided to change at all.
Given a decision to change I see nothing strange in being able to increase
it that far in 80 years. Most TLs are IMO restricted by economic factors,
but that of Andor and Candory is an exception; it was restricted by choice
of the Droyne leaders. Assuming that the Droyne had the ressources to buy
what they needed they could easily achieve the change in 80 years.

>(AND their governemnt changed, from a oligarchy to the traditional Droyne 
>hierarchy.  Whatever that is...)

Droyne oligarchy: A bunche of leaders run things in concert. Droyne
hierachy: One leader is on top. You know, that change fits in quite
nicely: Change of leadership, chande of policy.

I just thought of one simple explanation: Candory has 1/6th the population
of Andor. Given a drive to modernize it may just be that it is faster to
implement for 9 millions than for 56 millions. If so, Andor just lags a
little behind.

They aren\'t forbidden to have starports; there\'s just no point in having
one if you\'re not allowed to _use_ it ;-)

It is well known by all Ancient experts that Droyne have an almost religious
respect for Ancient artifacts. The risk of a Droyne trading in Ancient items
is _far_ less than the risk of some non-Droyne raiding a site.

A good question. I agree that for the Droyne it\'s not a matter of being able
to do it, but of choosing to do it. Why just now? I don\'t know.

Actually, there are other Droyne worlds with stellar technology, if I
remember correctly. Wasn\'t there another candidate for Droyne home world
in Deneb sector?

> RICE paper alert, RICE paper alert!!!

As a service, here is my library data about Andor and Candory.
Note that while I\'ve tried to account for all official data, I\'ve added
quite a bit of my own. The following is what applies in my universe, not
the official one.


ANDOR:  1)  Imperial client system in Spinward Marches 0236 with a
type F3 V star, several inhabited planets (including 2) below), no
planetoid belts, and three gas giants. The whole system is under
imperial interdict.
	2) Fifth planet of the Andor system, a mediumsize  (10,056
km diameter)  agricultural  planet  in  the life zone with average
spaceport,  heavy  tainted atmosphere,  54% water cover,  moderate
population  (56 millions),  oligarchial  government,  moderate law
level, and early stellar technology (C695735-9). 
	A is inhabited by DROYNE that was most likely transplanted
here ca. -400,000 by the ANCIENTS. Some experts are however of the
opinion  that  A  is in fact the legendary lost home planet of the
Droyne, ESKALOYT.
	The Andorites developed jump-1 technology around -6000 and
colonized the neighbouring world CANDORY (qv.).
	Andor was discovered during the original exploration sweep
of the Spinward Marches in 55, was contacted by the Scouts in 356,
and became an Imperial protectorate in 602.  It was interdicted by
the Fleet in 802  "in order to protect the indigenous population".
According to the treaty of 602,  however,  the inhabitants are en-
titled to free access to the rest of the Imperium. This means that
the interdict  only applies to beings who are not citizens of A or 
Candory.
	Andor has a number of Ancient sites. These sites are most-
ly unexplored  due to the religious sentiments of the inhabitants.
The  planet  is  listed  as  a  Red Zone by the TAS because of the
Imperial interdict. [325-934]


CANDORY: 1) Imperial bunary system in Spinward Marches 0336 with a
F6 V primary, a type M3 D secondary, one inhabited planet ( 2) be-
low), two planetoid belts, and no gas giants. The whole system is
under Imperial interdict.
	2) Fifth planet of the Candory system, a mediumsize (7,529
km diameter) non-industrial  planet  in the life zone with average
spaceport,  heavy  tainted atmosphere,  32% water cover,  moderate
population  (9 millions),  oligarchial  government,  moderate  law
level, and early stellar technology (C593634-9).
	C was colonized by DROYNE from ANDOR in -6000. Andor and C
was  contacted by the Scouts in 356 and became an Imperial protec-
torate in 602.  They  were  both interdicted by the Navy in 802 in
order to protect the local population. According to the Treaty of
602, however, the inhabitants of the two planets are entitled to
come and og as they please, so in practice the interdict does not
apply to the locals. 
	C is thought to have several Ancient sites. These are for
the most part unexplored due to the near-religious feelins of the
locals for them. Some Ancient experts are of the opinion that the
sites on C merely dates back to the colonization in -6000.
	C  is  listed  as  a  Red Zone  by the TAS because of the
Imperial interdict. [276-934]

        As I recall, the jump grid could actually take a limited amount of
damage without seriously affecting the performance. Above some limited
number the chances of misjump went up with each 10% of grid destroyed (as I
recall).

   SC:2                        19

The Nigiyabzi-class cruiser is an extremely famous class of warships, 
second only to the Type S scout in it\'s importance to the early history 
of the Third Imperium.  The Nigiyabzi ships closely resemble the 
Buntain Destroyers, itself built to replace the aging 1000 
disp Cross-sword ships of the Sylean Federation.  The Buntain ships - like 
all fast destroyers - were built for speed, agility and fuel endurance 
at the expense of about everything else, and the first Buntain hull was 
laid down in -30.

However, Co-ordinator Cleon Zhusatu\'s expansion/exploration initiatives 
of -22 onward eventually required a starship with decent armourment, good cargo 
capasity, endurance, surface landing capasity and the highest jump capasity 
available.  The requirements also demanded a large low berth crew, as   
the projected starship should touch base as rarely as possible, yet be 
capable of any small-scale military action (including in-and-out 
invasions of hostile territory) and maintain it\'s rated crew levels 
after any number of small naval engagements with smaller, less powerful 
but much more numerous opponents.  Moreover, cargo was to be increased to 
hold all sorts of spares and replacements needed for the ship, since it 
was expected to only rarely be able to visit a naval base or a suitable port.

The Buntain ships fit most of the spec\'s, but were modified as follows:
          - their 2000 Mj, 2.5m bore P.A. was replaced 
            with an el cheapo 2000Mj, 1m bore PA.
          - most of the laser turrents were removed, replaced by 2 
            missile turrents.  The 12 sandcasters were cut down to 4.
          - after most of the offensive bite of the Buntains were eliminated
            the Admiralty wished to cut the G-rating to 2 from 4 (and 
            slash the size of the expensive power plants), but vigourous 
            complaints from Sylean captains made this impolitic.
          - 20% of the fuel capasity of the Buntains were grabbed for 
            additional low berths and drastically increased cargo space 
          - An additional docking bay was hived off for 2 2 disp air/rafts
          - a full NOE suite was installed 

This rather mauled varient of the Buntains was rechristened as the 
Nigiyabazi-class Cruiser: the first commissioning of this class of 
warship was in -8, with new-built vessels being produced from -4 onwards.

Production of these vessels was steeped up to hectic levels as the 
newborn Third Imperium began to rapidly \'reacquire\' all of the old 
territory of the First and Second Imperia.  These ships basically did 
Second Contact/Show the Flag missions, usually in the wake of the Type S 
scouts (the TL 12 version, of course).  They were utilized for 
innumerable light duties, from anti-piracy operations to enforcing Bans 
("Bans" were the early equivelant to "Red Zones").  The Nigiyabazi\'s were 
the first 1000+ disp ships obtained by the Scout Service, breaking the 
Imperial Navy\'s jealous hold on spinal weapons, in 58.

The last Regular Navy Nigiyabazi cruiser was decommissioned in 104: 
however, Scout versions continued to serve until 183.  More importantly, 
the Nigiyabazi cruiser served as the prototype of later Scout cruisers, 
influencing Scout designs right up to the First Civil War (600-620)

As antiques, the Nigiyabazi was highly sought after: no versions existed 
in the Domain of Deneb by the Fourth Frontier War (1104) as they had all 
been bought as trophy ships by Imperial Core nobility.  About 200 ships 
existed in 1116, almost all in Core Sector.

Nigiyabazi vs. Aurora: a comparison

        LC Aurora
M5:4-2-1-0                -2E   A side-by-side comparison between these
-                        TL C   ships - both serving similar purposes for
-                       FC -4   equally young nations - shows the 
L(*10)4:1-1-0-0      M:12(24)   general superiority of the Aurora\'s of
A:10 P:4 J:10 Msk   (P) J2 G2   the Reformation Coalition.
AV:1                        -
SC:6                       17   Benefits that the Aurora enjoys include a 
                                superiour spinal weapon, better anti-missile
         CF Nigiyabazi          and anti-laser protection, and a much better
P2:6-4-4-2                  -2  missile suite.  Also, the Aurora\'s can 
-                         TL C  afford to spend their G-turns much more
-                        FC -4  freely - sorta. (29.6 G-turns for the Aurora
L(*1)4:1-1-0-0         M:2(10)  vs. 36.4 G-turns for the Nig., 63.2 G-turns
A:10 P:2 J:10 Msk  (SP) J3 G4*  for the Aurora vs. 42.7 G-turns for the 
AV:2  AuxB                   -  Nig., including jump fuel.) 
SC:2                        19

The Aurora\'s modular construction is quite important, giving it the 
capasity to be a superiour - or inferiour - vessel to the Nigiyabazi: the 
Aurora at the top is already configured for naval warfare 
(well, it\'s the best configured Aurora in Battle Rider: with additional 
missile modules, it would beat the Nigiyabazi hands down: but it\'s 
g-turns would fall sharply with the 400-ton fuel module given over to 
additional missile batteries.)

Even without any additional military modules, the Aurora would have 8 
Laser turrents vs. the Nigiyabazi\'s 2, but no ready missiles vs. the 
Nigiyabazi\'s 10.

Problems for the Aurora vs. the Nigiyabazi includes less armour, less 
endurance (no low berth crew for the Aurora, vs. nearly a full extra crew 
for the Nigiyabazi: also, the Nig. has an Auxillary Bridge), a weaker 
capasity for ground operations (The Aurora cannot enter atmosphere: no 
can it scoop fuel from the atmosphere or gas giants), and weaker 
mobility overall (Jump 2 vs. Jump 3: G2 vs. G4).

Also, note the size of the Aurora is "-2E", that is, it\'s to be treated 
as size -3 (Large) when active array\'s are used to find it.  Also, it\'s 
active EMS array doesn\'t have Direction Finding capasity, limiting it\'s 
abilities should the Passive array go down.

The Nigiyabazi can take a lot more licking than the Aurora can: this 
isn\'t important in the Battle Rider game (simplified strategic), but of 
great importance in the Brillant Lancers game (detail tatical).
The top hits that can be sustained (2H+) is...
      Aurora               Nigiyabazi     
   Power Plant   46H    Power Plant  (Main) 140H

   ArtifiGrav     2H    30-ton Hangar         2H

Factor in the larger number of staterooms and low berths that the 
Nigiyabazi has, and it becomes evident that the Nigiyabazi can take more 
damage for a good deal longer than the Aurora.  This means nothing in 
Battle Rider, but a lot in Brilliant Lances

Oh oh.....

Supposedly, the Aurora has 12 missile directors, and 24 missiles: 
however, it has 1 MFD for every five missiles, and it can only have 
barbettes (5-missile launcher), not turrents (2-missile launcher), so it 
can\'s have *12* missiles.  This has distasteful implications: would GDW 
please clarify the situation, if they\'re still listening?

A better situation assummes a loadout of 
        - 100-ton Armed Quarters Module 
          (37 staterooms, 3 laser turrents, 1 missile MFD)
        - 5 * 25-ton Missile Modules (25 missiles, 5 MFD\'s)
        - 1 * 25-ton Lifeboat module
        - 1 * 50-ton General Cargo module
        - 1 * 400-ton Fuel module
        - NO Sandcasters (vs. the "12 Sandcasters" the Battle Rider 
numbers imply!)

Incidentally, there is NO WAY the Aurora can mount sandcasters: not one 
module has them, and the Aurora isn\'t built with any.  I haven\'t compared 
all the info on Battle Rider sheets with the actual Brilliant Lances 
spec\'s, but I recommend that anyone who want\'s the BR info to be accurate 
to the BL spec\'s do their own footwork, and not take GDW\'s sheets \'as is\'.

No, I *don\'t* know if the Aurora is *really* over the 50 G-turn limit.  
However, I ain\'t going to rebuilt the entire ship here.  Doing so is 
quite necessary, though, is you really want to know that the Battle Rider 
numbers are accurate.  It\'s a pity that GDW did such fine work on the 
rules, but still let soch ugly mistakes through. 
                   
Nigiyabazi vs. Aurora: a new comparison

        LC Aurora               Here, with some more accurate numbers plugged
M5:4-2-1-0                -2E   in, the Nigiyabazi isn\'t quite as out-
-                        TL C   matched as before.  Indeed, with better
-                       FC -4   jump capasity, more troop capasity, and  
L(*6)4:1-1-0-0        M:6(25)   dirtside landing/refuelling available, it\'s
A:10 P:4 J:10 Msk   (P) J2 G2   can be argued that the Nigiyabazi is a 
AV:1                        -   all-round better explorer/gunboat than 
SC:X                       17   the Aurora.

         CF Nigiyabazi          The Aurora still retain it\'s advantages in
P2:6-4-4-2                  -2  it\'s superiour spinal gun and larger 
-                         TL C  missile capasity.  The Nigiyabazi
-                        FC -4  stands a good chance of defending against
L(*1)4:1-1-0-0         M:2(10)  a Aurora attack, but is still at an disad-
A:10 P:2 J:10 Msk  (SP) J3 G4*  vantage in attacking an Aurora, due only
AV:2  AuxB                   -  to it\'s fuel deficencies. 
SC:2                        19  

Note that the Aurora has two standard computers, and only one fibre optic 
computer.  Should the Fb computer be taken out, the Aurora becomes quite 
vulnerable to radiation from the Nigiyabazi\'s partical accellerator. 

Tatical recommendations:

Standard Aurora vs. Nigiyabazi pratice is to drive towards the 
Nigiyabazi, then - within, say, 10 light-seconds - fire it\'s missiles all 
at once, increasing the chances of impact despite the Nigiyabazi\'s dodging.  

If the missiles hit, close for the kill - but keep at least 5 
light-seconds from the Nigiyabazi, just in case it\'s PA is still active 
(and keeping in mind of the Aurora\'s vulnerability to the laser turrents, 
thank\'s to it\'s thin skin).

If playing Brillant Lancers, the Aurora would retreat if no critical hits 
are made by the missiles. If Battle Rider, the Aurora would close and 
dodge at the same time, to put it\'s meson gun at it\'s best use while 
limiting it\'s vulnerability to any counterfire by the Nigiyabazi.

Standard Nigiyabazi vs. Aurora pratice would be to dodge the Aurora\'s 
missiles while firing it\'s own, either singly to keep the Aurora 
distant, or all at once hoping for a critical hit (and overwhelm it\'s 
decent antimissile lasers and it\'s feeble evasion capasities, while 
taking advantage of the Aurora\'s vulnerability to active sensors).

If the Aurora is hit badly, close for the kill.  If not, retreat.  Fuel 
disipline would be closely observed.

Where does this idea come from?  Red zone designation
means only  the following:

	"Red Zone:  The Traveller\'s Aid Society travel zone
classification for a nation, world, or system which is
dangerous to travellers.  In general, the imposition of a
red zone classification indicates the location is
quarantined, interdicted by a higher authority, or at war.
	"Quarantine indicates that a dangerous disease is present, 
and the danger of war is self-explanatory, but interdiction 
requires further discussion. Interstellar governments often 
find it necessary to restrict access to worlds or systems 
for positical or military reasons, and do so by publishing 
interdictions.  Enforcement of interdiction varies with the 
reason for the restriction.  Interdiction may be imposed on 
a world if it is a military base or other sensitive 
installation, for the private reservations belonging to 
powerful families desiring seclusion, for developing 
societies which the government has elected to allow to 
evolve in isolation, or for valuable resource areas being 
saved for later development or exploitation."

Library Data (N-Z), at 16.

The Library Data entry implies that red zone classification
may be temporary -- e.g., for the duration of a war or
epidemic.  This reason alone demonstrates that it is not
inconsistent to have both a starport and a red zone.  A 
world with a starport could be at war or suffering from an 
epidemic at the time that the starmap was published, but by 
the time the travellers arrive, everything is back to 
normal and the planet has rejoined interstellar commerce.

Moreover, several stated examples of interdictions imply
that some travellers are allowed to travel (even without
restrictions) to and from the interdicted world --
specifically, military base, other sensitive installation,
or private family reservation.  Each of these situations
would be well served by a starport.

Do we know why Andor and Candory are red zoned?  Ancient
sites, if any are present (I don\'t remember) are certain
to be treated as sensitive installations.  The government
may have "elected to allow [these worlds] to evolve in
isolation", perhaps at the request of the Droyne
themselves.  I don\'t believe that the canon specifies the
reasons for the classifications, leaving it to us as 
referees to make sense of the data given.

I pronounce it as if it were French:  >>o benn<< and be
sure to make your lips into a real "o".  That usually puts 
the Aubainois in stitches.

Ah! An easy question to answer:

In classic Traveller, the canon was jump coils forming part of the jump 
drive mechanism (source: Supplement 8, Library Data A-M. The entry on 
Lanthanum says that Lanthanum is a rare earth element used in the 
construction of coils for jump drives).

In Megatraveller, the canon was jump grids covering the hull of the ship 
(source: Starship Operator\'s Manual - already quoted on this list).

In TNE, the canon appears to be jump coils again (source: a conversation 
with Dave Neilson reported on this list a few days ago).

I\'ll leave it to others to discuss the relative merits/flaws of each system.

Hope this helps (or fans the fires, or whatever...)

Kind Regards

Following up other peoples\' posts,

I think (shields up) that the C ratings date back to before _space_ports
existed, i.e. pre-CT book 6 (Scouts). Even an interdicted planet would
probably be allowed _space_ports to allow in-system or fast around-the-world
travel. I don\'t have the data with me to know if these systems had scout
bases, but the C rating might otherwise indicate the facilities available to
scout, military or other ships with special permission to land there. Or the
starport could be open to normal shipping but the rest of the world is
interdicted (i.e. extremely severe customs at the starport).

I think it\'s mentioned in High Guard though I couldn\'t swear to it - its

I would have thought that there would be a \'safety valve\' to bleed off
all of the extra energy.  However, I wouldn\'t want to be near the ship
when the valve blows.

For some reason, crawling around a drive room filled with huge capacitors
while someone is shooting at you wouldn\'t really appeal to me as a player.
I suppose it might give you a buzz :)

As for the Sparklers/Primordials, you\'ll need to obtain a copy of the somewhat

Personally, I hope the Primordials _do_ play a part in TNE.  I don\'t buy Dave\'s

I think the jump grid was much more resistant to damage than this. According to 
the Q&A in Travellers\' Digest 16, if under 10% of the grid is destroyed, then 
the computer can compensate, if over 10% is destroyed, then the jumpspace 
calculations become more complex, but can still be done (of course this delay 
could let people chasing you catch up). It seems that they were designed with 
very heavy multiple redundancy. This could be justified as even if you don\'t 
get shot at, it would be a shame if a particle hitting you in orbit took out a 
critical jump wire. But anyway, I like the hull grids, those mesh ore carriers 
are such a colourful idea that they alone should justify the concept.

Hang on though ..... why do we need to debate whether there is still a hull 
grid? GDW may have informally said that they are moving back to jump coils, but 
if so, would they perhaps like to explain why in FFS, page 42 there is the 
reference \'Jump drives .... Surface area: Surface area in square meters equals 
cubic meters of jump drive /3\'. If that isn\'t a reference to a hull grid, then 
what is it?

    'body' => '   One of the tweaks most designers make to their designs is to delete life 
support for the ship\'s fuel tankage, saving on volume and cost. Yet GDW\'s 
designs all include life support for fuel tanks. This might not just be useful 
for maintainance though, it could be a vital part of ship\'s life. After all, 
the tension in jumpspace on board a Broadsword or a Midu Agashaam must be very 
great, not only trapped in the ship, but also trapped in jumpspace. 
Early Solomani psychologists noticed that mental illness became more common as 
interstellar travel increased, and attributed it mainly to effects of 
jumpspace.
   To help alleviate this stress it became a custom for ships in jumpspace to 
use their now empty jumpfuel tanks as a recreation space, with fittings for use 
in tennis/squash/basketball/boloball etc. The size of the tanks often surprises 
first time travellers, as the contrast with the size of staterooms is very 
great.
Example tank sizes
Broadsword     2240m^3.  Sports room 4m x 23.6m x 23.6m
Midu Agashaam  10,500m^3  - 7m x 30m x 50m

Adventure Seeds:

The liner the characters are travelling on holds a boloball league.

A mercenary cruiser holds a martial arts contest.

When the tanks are opened in jumpspace, a freeze dried body is found inside.

While a game is in progress in the tank, a valve from the maneuver fuel tank 
springs open, spraying liquid hydrogen into the tank - mechanical fault or 
sabotage?

Poor hydrogen evacuation before it is turned over to recreational use results 
in a massive fireball, gutting much of the ship and threatening to destroy the 
jump bubble.

I can\'t find the original reference, but IIRC, the
Droyne essentially asked the Scout Service to
interdict Andor and Candory. They didn\'t want
visitors, but of course had no problems trading
with themselves, or visiting Imperial worlds at
their leisure...

As for starports, since the interdict is Droyne-
requested, though enforced by the Scout Service, 
they can have any old starport they want.
They might even let the Scout Service interdicters
use it, if they\'re feeling generous...

"Lanthanum:  A rare earth element, the first of the inner transition metals.
 Vital to the construction of the inner coils of interstellar jump drive
 units."  -- _The Kinunir_, p. 41.
 
Capacitors are tracked for force field generators.  In High Guard, they were 
0.5MJn% of the ship, where M is tonnage and Jn is jump number.  In TNE, they\'re 
35% of the jump drive.

I suspect that they are not scrapping the hull grid entirely, just saying that
it is not made of lanthanum or a lanthanum alloy.  This would actually be
*more* consistent with classic Traveller than MegaTraveller, since Traveller
had hull grids (the jump tug and Marc Miller\'s "Jumpspace" article) but also
internal lanthanum inner coils.

Early Vilani psychologists probably noticed, too.  How do 
the Zhodani design their ships?  Probably with a lot more 
attention to mental health than either group of Imperial 
humans.

This depends, of course, on how fuel tanks are designed.  
If you surround the ship with fuel tanks (like the Kinunir 
or the Type S), the tanks may not be very usable, because 
they\'ll be conforming to the outer hull shape.  On the 
other hand, if you make fuel decks (like Azhanti High 
Lightning), you can certainly use them for sports, dances 
(a zero-G disco? or maybe a high-G disco?), cocktail 
parties, etc.  What about a swimming pool?

  I was going through my collection of Traveller material, and
  found a message that was posted to rec.games.rpg back in 1992-06.
  It claimed to be material from Sunbane and the TML (from before
  the split, when it was housed at engrg.uwo.ca).  It was a grid of
  Charted Space sectors, with a list of names of those sectors.
  Since receiving this stuff originally, I\'ve chickenscratched all
  over it, and have a fairly complete set of sector names, in some
  cases in two or three languages.

  If people are interested, I\'d be willing to post this data to the
  list.

Glenn Goffin noted that Red Zones can indeed be on worlds with starports, 
as they can be A) erected for temporary emergencies B) there\'s no legal 
reason banning starports on banned worlds.

I believe my mixup began due to the world generation sequence for T:TNE 
where Red Zoned worlds are to have their starports listed "X". (I may be 
mistaken even here: I\'ll go look it up when I get home).

Thanks for the responses!

Just recently got my Cats & Rats from Egor (ad posted previously).  Some 
tidbit\'s and questions from the book:

A: Jupiter is considered a *small* Gas Giant! (size 90, to be exact)
B: The Perseus Project - an exploration of the Perseus Arm of the galaxy 
   - sent 17 \'base ships\' out to 3,000 parsecs from the Confederation.  
   Three of those ships are overdue, and have not returned by the onset of 
   Virus. Where are they?  Is there some other cluster of jump-capable 
   civilizations besides our own Charted Space?  Or did they decide to 
   strike out on their own, and go independent?  If so, will we ever see 
   them - or their decendant\'s - again?
C: Santaterra was a precollapse philosophy found throughout the Solomani 
   Confederation which was pro-agarian, anti-geneering, and anti-A.I.: they 
   also prefer low tech level worlds.  These folk should gove the RC quite a 
   challange, once they\'re found...  [Similar to the imperial Society of the 
   Sovereginty of Man over Machine (SSMM?)]
D: The \'flavour\' of a New Era campagin in Solomani space would be quite 
   interesting.  The system\'s would be more isolationistic, and have fewer 
   mutual \'foundations\', as the Confederation were never very united in 
   the first place.  I\'d postuate that there would be fewer TED\'s (a cousion 
   of the famous Feudal Technocracy, a very Third Imperium form of 
   government), and more old-fashioned dictatorships (mystical and secular) 
   as well as democracies and tribal governments.
E: I\'d thing it would be easier to form a pocket empire in 
   ex-Confederation space, since the framework s already there (and they 
   wern\'t \'softened up\' for Virus by civil war).  It would be much harder 
   for any pocket empire to expand beyond it\'s pre-Collapse boundaries, 
   though: the neighbours are often of a completely different culture, 
   language, etc.
F: The Solomani have never been particularly good in grav vechile design, 
   but are excellent starship builders.  This may provide an edge: coupled 
   with the fact that the Solomani are used to operating without a massive 
   hierarchy (noble or otherwise) telling them what to do, and thing\'s start 
   looking up (now, if only they don\'t start blasting away as soon as they 
   discover other starfarers)
G: It\'s extermely unlikely that the Solomani will ever consider making a 
   deal with Virus, thanks to their rather racist nature. 
H: It\'s most likely that any pocket empire in the Solomani Sphere 
   will welcome the anti-Imperial, largely Solomani RC with open arms.  
   The RC will definitely resemble the Confederation more than the 
   Imperium, if they expand rimward. (And in more ways than one, if the 
   Flammer\'s get their way...)

----*****----*****----

Now, it\'s the Aslan\'s turn:

A: The territory of the Aslan New Lords facing the Regency is a lot 
smaller than I thought: it\'s basically just Trojan Reach, along with a 
few scattered holdings in the Riftspan Reaches, Touchstone, and Iphigenaia.

Diagram:

    Tienspevnekr | Ziafrplians | Gvurrdon | Tulikki | Provence
    Far Frontiers| Foreven     | Marches  | Deneb   | Corridor
    Vanguard R.  | The Beyond  | Trojan R | Reft Sec| Gushemege
    Iphigenaia   | Touchstone  | RiftspanR| Verge   | Ilelish
      
Couple this with the fact that the Tech and population levels of the area 
is a good deal thinner than in the Regency.  Also link this with Zho 
weakness, and the current Regency tendency to eat small nations, and 
you\'ve got the makings of a "short, victorous war" here.  And the rewards 
of a semi-peaceful, semi-military expansion are a good bit higher than 
the same expansion in the Wilds. 

(Any expansion would, of course, not be against all Aslan: Standard 
Imperial Procedure would be allying with the weaker Aslan clans against 
the stronger ones, and insuring that the weaker clans swear feality to 
the Regent/Emperor. Moreover, any fighting would closely follow Aslan 
tradition: it\'s important to insure that the enemy recognizes that he\'s 
defeated, not just "temporarily - and unjustly - beaten by those 
honourless barbarians.")

For *real* Imperials, expansion is its own justification (hey, it worked 
for the Romans!).  For those of us who need some way to hide raw 
Imperialistic aggression, justifications range from "we need to be sure 
that those land-hungry Aslan NEVER jump us again" to "Aslan contact with 
their collapsed brothers are acting as a vector for Virus" (maybe fact, 
maybe lies) to "we are both stronger if we\'re united than if we remain 
seperated, and the New Era requires a united stand between equals" (this 
is my favourate possibility: it would cut down on the fighting and pump 
up the mixing of cultures, which is my real aim).

And all this talk about expanding Rimward/Spinward, rather than across 
Corridor back to the blasted heart of the beloved Imperium, is easily 
justified in economic dollars and cents: it\'s a lot easier and more 
profitable to incorporate living and Virus-free Aslan systems into the 
Regency than incorporate dead, xenophobic, anti-Imperial and low-tech 
systems into the Regency.

Justifying it in emotional and spiritual terms is a good deal harder.  
After all, just look at all those frozen corpses with Imperial Sunbursts 
on their collars!  You want their deaths to be meaningless, and abandon 
their children to a life of poverty and misery?  Never mind the fact that 
most of Imperial Core is now definitely anti-Imperial: *We* are the 
Keepers of the Flame, *We* have a DUTY to haul them back to Imperial 
Civilization, kicking and screaming if need be!

Well, maybe.  The Regency is definitely in an expansionistic mood: the 
question is really if they will still want to carry on the work in the 
Imperial Core, once they realize that most of the population stands 
against them.  If so, then they have chosen the hard, bitter route - and 
the glorious Imperium will live again, worse for wear, but still 
ticking, the very definition of the power of Honour, Love, and Compassion.  

If they turn their back, the Imperium will still live, but as an alien, 
bi-racial culture, on the other side of the Rift.  Perhaps tri-racial, 
depending on how the Zho\'s make out.

And the children of the Wilds will _never_ forgive the Regency for 
abandoning them.  Never.

  To All who have benefited from the RICE Papers:

  Over the past year, the composition of the Board of Trustees has
  changed, and with those changes have come new ideas.  After long
  and difficult debate, and consultations with various individuals
  and groups throughout the Regency, a decision has been made that
  will have a significant (and, in our opinion, positive) impact on
  the scope of published RICE Papers.

  We have long viewed the Regency as the sum of its component parts
  - its member planetary systems - and no more.  However, we now
  realize what we overlooked before - that interstellar
  communication, migration, travel, and government affect culture,
  and are indeed a culture themselves.  More, there are ethnic
  groupings that have carried significant portions of their
  cultures from their homeworlds, and retained them, even after up
  to 1500 years of settlement on worlds far from their original
  homes.  These can no longer truly be considered planetary
  cultures, and they cannot truly be addressed within the context
  of a single RICE Paper focussed on a single planetary system.

  It is for this reason that we have decided to expand the scope of
  the RICE Papers, to allow our researchers and reporter to write
  on any aspect of Imperial culture (to which we of the Regency are
  the heirs) that they feel worthy of note - from topics as simple
  as the traditional Vilani game of \\saalir\\, ranging up through
  the traditions of the various Imperial Yachting Cup competitions,
  or of shipboard etiquette, all the way up to the complexities
  of the Terran faith of Binay Abrim, or of the interaction between
  Vilani, Sylean, and Vargr social traditions in the coreward areas
  of the Regency.

  To do less would be to break faith with our Charter, which
  charges us with furthering "Cultural Education".  It is our hope
  that you, as we, will find this change to be for the better.

My thanks to David Jaques-Watson for additional information, permitting

I\'ve chosen to retain both the \'alien\' Efate and their welcoming nature: 
remember, these people are Xenophilic (they don\'t even fear the Zho\'s!) 
but also Militant (Ready to fight when you are, Captain!).

ARRIVAL

When you leave jump, you\'re 100 diameter\'s from the primary star: Efate is 
only 68 local stellar diameters out, so your ship will come out between 
194 and 394 light-second from Efate.

Coming through the RQS rigamore is a good bit easier here then in most 
places: Virus is not nearly the threat that the Zho\'s can be, in the
eyes of the local Efate.  So long as the traveller doesn\'t do anything 
blatently stupid, he should be able to arive at the starport in a 
reasonably short time.

[REFEREE: The world name is also used to refer to singluar and plural Efate.]

Looking down on the world as the RQS quickly rifles thru his ship, he\'s 
likely to mistake the Vistoner plate as the world\'s sole continent.  
While it sure looks like one, it has actually been shattered into 
something like a jigsaw puzzle. Each island - about 300 to 700 km in 
diameter - is seperated by it\'s neighbour by a 1-4 km moat, which goes 
down 3-5 kilometers in depth.  How this highly unlikely geographic formation 
is still under some debate: since there\'s no impact crater, the answer 
must reside in some truly odd plate tectonics.  The world itself seems
geologically dead: there are no mountain chains, and no volcanoes.  The 
bottom of the moats is covered by silt and dirt settling in from above: 
estimates are that the crevaces go down another 2 km below the silt floor.

After barely setting foot on this world, each member of the company will 
be given a holographic Efate guide - an avatar - to help the visitor 
navigate his way through the customs and traditions that govern Efate 
society.  The guide will refuse payment from the visitors: he is usually 
a construct by a local tourist agency, and will encourage the visitors 
to use his agency\'s facilities.

The harsh chemicals that render the air poisonous to humans stemms from 
the TiiKii plant.  While rarely seen in the cities where humans frequent, 
they dominate the shallow swamplands of Efate\'s equatoral regions, 
released during the sudden, massive "explosions" of the plant\'s sexual 
organs.  The Efate - ever gracious to their human visitors - feel 
ashamed by this, but can do nothing: too many species depend on the 
TiiKii\'s foul gases for their life cycles.  

Humans are not advised to enter the swamplands: if they do, they must be 
very careful where they trod: stepping on a root can trigger off the 
explosion.

THE EFATE RACE

The guide is worth a twice-over (even if he\'s just a hologram).  The typical 
lithe Efate stands at a little over average height, with a deep bronze 
skin, longish wavy hair in a variety of light colours (white, various 
shades of grey, and pale yellow), and high cheekbones.  They look like a 
minor race - or a bodysculptured noble - but are not actually human at 
all.  

The Efate was contacted by the Imperium soon after arriving in Regina 
subsector.  At the time, they were a highly sedentary race of omnivores; 
weighing in at about 300 kg, they looked something like large, 
occasionally biped, glorified squirrels, with faceted eyes, an ungainly 
gait, and a grating language of squeals and whines.  Primitive they were 
not, though: when the I.S.S. Coilirela touched down here in 182, they had 
already reached TL 4, with some research to TL 6.

The Efate - or the KriiLeeiKariit, as they called themselves at the time 
- welcomed the Imperium gladly, becoming a client state in 211 and 
obtaining formal membership in 243.  A highly industrious people, they 
swiftly reached TL A by 400, and by the First Civil War was at TL D. 

It was at this time when wealthy KriiLeeiKariit started to shape 
themselves and their children as humans.  The prestige of being human, 
and the natural KriiLeeiKariit love and fondness of humaniti, began to 
approach it\'s ultimate conclusion.  By 880, the "New People" were over 
half the population: by 1000, the KriiLeeiKariit were extinct.  But the 
"New People" - now taking the name of Efate as the name of their new race 
- were still not considered human, as they cannot interbreed, and have 
serious internal difference from humanity, especially at the DNA and 
molecular level.  

They still cannot eat most human food without pills and addatives: the very 
limited range of (highly processed) human food they _can_ digest 
without aides gives them debilitating stomach cramps and occasional 
vomiting "on bad days".  Because of their wholesale and self-inflicted 
genetic problems, they suffer appallingly short lifespans of about 40 
years, dying from a vast variety of heridatory diseases.  And over 60% 
of all Efate are originally born from some artifical method: the 
rebuilding of the KriiLeiiKariit reproductive system to imitate human 
mammalian norms is a great triumph of science, but even today a Efate 
woman going through natural childbirth takes her life in her hands.  Of 
course, Efate genetic science plows ahead to relieve these problems.

EFATE CITIES

Efate cities are very crowded.  The Efate are an extremely gregarious 
race, and they love the hustle and bustle of the urban enviroment.  Their 
cities aren\'t very tall, but do spread out over thousands of kilometers of 
area.  Clothing tends to imitate the latest Regina fashion, and many of 
the social attitudes are also familiar to native-born Reginans.  
Strangers are enjoyed my most Efate: they are easily forgiven of any minor 
errors, and even if guilty of a grevious crime, will only suffer 
- at worst - expulsion from Efate.

What most stand\'s out on Efate is the vast number of holographic people - 
called "avatars" - which mix and talk with the real Efate.  Some of these 
people have been sent by their masters to complete some errand, but most 
of the avatars are of dead Efate, who\'s personality is brought to live by 
AI programs.  

[REFEREE: Pre-Virus, the images are projected by small, mobile robot spheres 
which hover over a spot, and project the image downward.  Now, the 
cameras and AI computer is mounted on trained TrWanak gasbag animals: the AI
has no way to communicate to other computers, and can only direct the 
gasbag by mechanical prodding.  Also, the AI is designed to mechanically 
fail if infected by Virus.]

The Servenai Cults - the premiere Marchman religion, after Imperial 
Catholicism - have many Efate followers, and insists that the souls of 
the dead are only satisified if they\'re images are permitted to walk the 
land.  The Cults - which originated on Capon/2324 (B747748-A) - resemble 
the Roman mystery cults, with ancient Vilani philosophy thrown in: 
currently, 20% of all Marchmen follow it.

HONOUR

While most Imperial/Regency worlds are known for taking Honour and 
Tradition seriously, Efate is unique in the extent that it reveres these 
concepts.  One of the things that the Efate can\'t get their heads around 
is human laws: they simply cannot comprehend how they act.  What they 
*do* understand, however, is Personal Honour.  Each individual Efate is 
responsible to make his portion of the universe as fine and noble as 
possible.  And each Efate\'s life is governed by his own personal Honour 
Code, which is held as sacred.  

Each Efate is expected to uphold the Code individually, rather than 
depend on a government to maintain it.  If an evil occurs, the Efate that 
witnesses it is to correct it: he *cannot* pass on that responsibility to 
someone else. 

The Efate nobility\'s main purpose is to provide living examples of what 
honour mean, to set an example for the nation and the race.  The local 
nobility has shifted over the centuries from a priesthood to a democracy 
to an oligarchy of noble families, but how they govern - the source of 
their authority - remains the same. 

The Code - basically the obligation to be and live the truth as best as 
ability allows - is the foundation of trust on Efate.  Because it\'s taken 
so seriously, the system can continue to be the only known high-pop world 
without any formal laws at all.  Of course, every Efate\'s individual Code 
varies, but all strive towards the same goal, and tend to have many 
similiarities.

One of the more common manifestations of the Code is Paterfamilias: that 
is, the eldest male is assummed to be the lord of his household.  While he 
doesn\'t officaly have the \'right\' to kill anyone in his household that he 
wishes - the Efate only believes in duties and responsibilities, not 
rights - most Efate will not interfere or ostrazise a father who does, 
even in public.

Other common traits of the Honour Code is a willingness to take the law 
in your own hands; a very strong fear of shame before others; love of 
family, home, and empire; and contempt for those who challange the Code. 

THE FIFTH FRONTIER WAR

The honour code - despite it\'s valued place within Efate culture - has 
often been the source of some of the most intratacable conflicts on 
Efate.  One well-known conflict - between the Keeslia\'k and the Keia\'ss 
noble houses - has often led to contnous bushfire war\'s in the bitter 
Polar wastes of Efate.  This conflict eventually grew like topsy: by 
1107, it pitted most of the lesser noble houses against the five High Houses.
Covert Zho support of the smaller houses was quite well-known: the Efate 
never was as phobic towards psionics as Imperials were, and often 
consider the \'truthful\' Zhodani as basically more honourable than Imperials.

Between 1000 and 1107, the Imperium/Domain/Regency had to send Marine 
unit\'s no less than *fifteen* times to restore the peace, with each 
incident worse than the last.  During one of these incident\'s - the 
famous Razor Wars of 1107 - most of Makitii District was thrown in a 
state of chaos, requiring Imperial Marines to put down the rebellion 
(078-1107).  The Imperials expected a walkover, considering the rather 
poor equipment the lesser noble armies had.  

Boy, were they surprised.  The rebellious nobles didn\'t have much in the 
way of fancy equipment, but they were well prepared, and - with plenty 
of Zho advise and psionic aid - were able to hit the Marines unexpectedly 
hard throughout the Cackiit Highlands.  While their tactic of using a 
Merc cruiser to deliver a 5MT nuclear warhead to the main body of 
Imperial troops failed (see "A daggar at Efate", JTAS #? "), several 
other subterfuges - including sneaking a large supply of haevy fusion 
rifles - were successful.

The marines were just getting a bead on the rebellion put down when the 
Fifth Frontier War swept thru Regina subsector, placing Efate under 
siege from 214-1107 to the armistice, declared at 099-1110 (The war was 
officaly declared over at 001-1111).  

Ferocious naval clashes ensured betweem the Zho. 1st Assault Fleet - 
tasked to take Efate - and the defending Imperial 193rd Fleet.  However, 
because the Zho\'s could not secure their supply line through Louzy, the 
1st Assault Fleet couldn\'t bring their full potential force to bear 
against the 193rd.  The unconqured Imperial outposts at Louzy could also 
supply information to Imperial forces regarding incoming reinforcemetns, 
permiting the 193rd to successfully defend against several offensives.  
>From mid-1109, the Zho\'s were releasing ships to fight at other fronts, 
but were still strong enough to resist the Imperial attempt to relieve 
Efate during Operation Iedshrpr (launched 029-1109), spearheaded by 
elements of the Corridor Fleet.

The intense fighting was used by the High Houses as the justification 
used to purge the lesser houses from all government positions.  This led 
to even more embittered fighting, and eventually to several ugly 
atrocities.  In the aftermath of the Fifth Frontier War, most of the 
lesser houses was stripped of their titles and exiled to Ley Sector by 
order of the Emperor: most of the major leadership was shot for High Treason.
With the leadership of the Lesser Houses not only destroyed, but 
considered dishonourable - this in a culture that values honour above all 
else - the continual bushfire wars of Efate came to an pernament end. 

RELIGION

While the Servani Cults are the most flamboyant religion on Efate, the 
dominant religion remains Imperial Catholicism.  The Deneb Rite remains 
the most influential with over half the population\'s alligence, but Sylean, 
American, and Vilani Rites are also common.  

The population is quite pious, and place strong emphasis on the 
graciousness of the Lord.  Assorted religious meetings - from major 
religious festivals to spontanious \'street dancing\' - is quite common.
While Efate does not have the most awe-inspiring cathederals or the most 
learned and wise of churchmen, they do embrace their faith with vigour 
and joy.  Which is somewhat ironic: about 2/3rds of Regency Christians 
believe that nonhumans shouldn\'t be allowed to join the church, either 
because they lack the "imageo dei" (the Image of God), or because they 
feel that Christianity is about God speaking to men, and that God would use 
other native religions to speak to nonhumans, not Christianity.

The tendency of Efate Catholics to stress the power of the Holy Spirit - 
and to utterly ignore the commandents and laws of God - tends to 
aggrivate most Catholic churchmen.  Never mind the problem of whether 
Jesus died for nonhuman sinners or not, or even if this theology even 
makes sense when applied to aliens. Or even if Efate are \'sinners\' in any 
meaningful sense: how can they transgress a law that they never recieved?

Note: Efate was a major beneficiary of the Regency Industrial Development 
Program.

Kinda depends on what kind of project he/she has going, and how
convenient it is for him/her to "die" and go underground again.
He/She could just try to discredit them or Kill them, remember such
a being would be able to weild Tremendious power, both political and
physical.
Hummm this could make a campaign in its own right, but I see it as more
a side treck and problems to dodge, you might not let them realize why
they keep having problems, They are close to the "secret" and are being
warned off, but knowing players they would just go deeper into the
puzzle... ;-)

This could keep them happy for years... <eg>...

No Jim I Am NOT thinking of using this in our game! ( I wouldn\'t do
that... Would I?
Heh heh <eg>
Then again you might have already crossed paths with such and never

         Hullo..

         I have been thinking about contra-grav and airframe structures in
         relation to ship designs and atmospheric landings, and I have a
         couple of question/thoughts.

         1)      In TNE Contra-Grav negates the attraction of a massive
         body (the planet) on another body (the ship) in such a way that
         the small body seems like it is in a grav field 1% of the normal
         grav field of the massive body.  If that is the case, why does it
         take so many G-hours to take off from a planet in a contra-grav
         equipped ship?  With Contra-Grav, taking off from Earth would be
         about the equivalent of taking off from a small asteroid in terms
         of the gravity well.  The figures in the TNE book, which are
         already higher than what is needed in reality, are out of line by
         almost 2 orders of magnitude when the contra-grav is considered.
         Should the tables be adjusted to show this, or can anyone show me
         where my reasoning went astray?

         2)      Does an airframe hull provide aerodynamic lift?  The 1.3x
         weight multiplier is suspiciusly similar to the 30% of gross
         weight for for the hypersonic airframe, and the rules state
         explicitly that SL and AF designs are hypersonic.  Can an airframe
         ship take off w/o contra-grav and fly like an airplane?  If not,
         does anyone have any suggestions for designing a non-CG spacecraft
         that had aerodynamic performance in atmosphere?

         The reason I ask is that the ref in the hard sf campaign I am in
         has ruled that HEPlaR are just cheap, efficient fusion rockets,
         and that you can\'t use them in atmosphere.  Needless to say,
         getting off the ground is once again a difficult thing to do.  In
         this type situation, Contra-Grav becomes really vital, and worth
         the expendature in power for the reduction in fuel usage.   The
         airframe moves in the other direction, and provides rules for a
         decent jump capable space-plane, assuming that sufficient runways
         and other landing facilities exist.  Combining the two in one hull
         is still justifiable, as contra-grav is the ultimate vtol engine,
         and would allow for low-fuel landings on worlds without
         atmospheres.  I guess this all points to one of my personal
         disappointments with FF&S, the lack of integration between
         aircraft, lift vehicle and spacecraft design...sigh...I guess
         it\'ll be awhile before I build a jump-2 747.

         In terms of canon, this interpretation of contra-grav actually
         would move TNE closer to MT and CT in that it would make access to
         orbit simple and cheap (check out the cargo rates in TNE - you
         can\'t make money at 1000cr/Ton or 10000cr/Passenger).  The
         airframe bit wouldn\'t make much difference one way or the other,
         as all the classic designs use Contra-Grav, but it could be useful
         for lower tech ships that are strapped for power.

         So whaddayall think?

1.	DROYNE WORLDS AND INTERDICTION

[Sorry, Alvin, other people\'s replies mean that I almost don\'t need to post
this - but I do have some extra info included!]

In digest 476, Alvin asked:

>First, how can a world be interdicted and have a starport?

I can find nothing prohibiting a starport on a Red Zone world. All system
generators simply mention that class-X worlds are "Generally red travel
zones".

In fact, there is one other Red Zone in the Marches with a starport:
	Djinni/Lanth 2111 (class-E)

A guy called Aleem Vren was building the \'port on Djinni back in _Twilight\'s
Peak_, c.1105. Note that it has reverted to class-X by 1201.

In 1201, Rhysk/Pax Rulin and Caraz/Pax Rulin are type-E and type-D,
respectively (note that Anomaly 5/Sabine should be shown on the map as "X",
not "A"; Lucifer/Gulf should be a "B", not an "X"). I believe that it IS
possible to be interdicted and have a \'port; it is just RARE (and should have a
*very* good reason).

I would assume that the "rise" in TL, plus the appearance of "An" in the Remarks
section of the UPP, reflects a lifting of Imperial censorship.

Aside: You may be interested to know that the 1117 stats are actually WRONG in
one important respect: the _Spinward Marches Campaign_ (c.1111) and the
_Imperial Encyclopedia_ (c.1117) both include the "An" tag in their listings.
Please note that I am not complaining - collating all the data required for the
RSB, then proof-reading the mountain of stats, then hoping that the printers get
it right, etc etc, would have been a hell of a task (just ask Bill Gates ;-).
I AM impressed at the level of detail which did make it into the book (eg. see
Dinom/Lanth, p 42). I\'m just glad we got the thing before Xmas.

However, the whole Andor/Candory thing IS worth a combined RICE Paper. As soon
as Andrew Madden and I finish Tavonni/Vilis, we\'ll have a gander at it (at the
moment, we are in the enviable position of having to CUT DOWN the amount of info
we have for the system %-).

Of course, if anyone else wants a hack at the Droyne, give it a go!

Points to include:
- the interdiction; why?
- possible Imperial fear of Ancient super-weapons
- Droyne in the Marches (eg. descendants of "The Spud", Droyne trader)
- the rapid rise in TL
- Droyne "hand-built jump drives" (should they really be class-A \'ports?)
- the Ancient sites
- Imperial theory that one of these worlds is Eskayloyt (the Droyne\'s "Lost
  Home")

2.	THE MYSTERY OF THE MISSING PLANET (soon to be published as "Alfred
	Hitchcock and The Three Investigators book #1999 ;-)

BTW, Can anyone resolve the mystery of the missing planet? In _The Spinward
Marches Campaign_, p27, this listing appears:

Hex  UPP        B Remarks     Data   Star1 Star2
2632 X895674-8    Ag nIn An   R201Im F3 V  M0 D

This listing is repeated in the _Imperial Encyclopedia_.

However, the original _Supplement 3: The Spinward Marches_ and the new _RSB_
do not show this listing.

(Note that this mystery system never appeared on ANY star chart).

Ideas, anyone:
- Ancient site, currently under exploitation?
- Grandfather\'s Virus trap activated?
- ?!?!?!?

3.	CORRECTIONS TO INTERSTEL I-1102 SOLOMANI SCOUT

In digest 477, Michael Bailey said:

>The redesign is slightly more expensive, but has a small increase in cargo

My original version says Cargo: 63 m^3, and so does the latest posting. Am I
missing something?

4.	LATE-BREAKING NEWS ON GEROME/RHYLANOR

Lewis, during my pursiut of a tag-line, I have actually discovered some data on
Gerome/Rhylanor!

"Gerome (Rhylanor 2818 x-573000-0): A moderate-sized world with a standard
tainted atmosphere and 30% water oceans, Gerome is unpopulated and has no
starport. Further, it is classified travel zone red. The interdiction of
movement to the world could be ofr any reason, but the lack of population
makes it probable that it is to protect as yet untapped mineral deposits.
Rumours or patrons could lead to the world, to prospecting and mining, and to
clashes with the authorities".
"The referee is responsible for creating various tables, maps, and charts which
would regulate the actual conduct of such a campaign".

No problem Bruce; I grabbed the stats anyway. Were they formatted OK? My version
has a name "Selig" that is at the bottom of the list, but without data. The

The Sylea is mentioned in the old Library Data (with a picture if I
remember... a giant Star Destroyer looking critter.  No stats, though.

The Voroshilef is from the _Rebellion_Sourcebook_ (MT), with MT stats.

The Boxy BRs look like ones in the MT _Fighting_Ships_, dunno about the
tenders.

The CL looks like the "Seh" Class in _Rebellion_Sourcebook_.

The CA looks like the "Planet" class in _Rebellion_Sourcebook_.

The "Rapier" looks like a picture in MT _Fighting_Ships_.

Hope this helps.

I haven\'t seen any FFS designs for these.  They are junky as big ships
anyway.  I posted some BR designs a while back, I\'ll mail \'em to you if
you want.

Actually, T2k made a pile of money for them - nearly as much as CT, in fact,
it ended up generating more profit than CT (which is one reason DGP was doing
CT while GDW was doing T2k).  Apparently there\'s lots of military buffs out
there...
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Really? I stand corrected then, although this also raises the question
of GDW\'s failure to capitalize on their 2 succeses. What happened? Why
have they been unable to produce follow-on lines that were as good (read;
profitable) as the predecessors? Why couldn\'t Trav & Twilight continue
to compound until GDW became a rival for \'that *other* rpg comp.\'? Instead
it seems to me that TNE represents a last, desperate, throw of the dice
by a company floundering in financial problems.

;-) That should get some enthusiastic posts!

"Brendan O\'Donovan" (Hi Brendan!) and another person said about grids being
able to take an amount of damage before totally disabling your jump ability.
I was not disputing that the grid can take some damage, merely that it is
easier to damage it given that it is on the outside, than the equivalent
hidden-in-the-engine-room coil thingy. As was then pointed out, FF&S still
allocates surface area for jump drives for... well hell, could it be a grid?
I lay odds on The "Fourth Imperium" (or "Imperium, The Next Generation") -
whatever GDW will call it - having jump grids back in. Anyone want a 1
penny/cent bet, eh? First, though it\'ll appear in FF&S ed.2 as an \'optional
extra\' under the \'alternative design sequences\'.

FUEL TANK DISCOS - CAN THE ALIEN PLAY?

Nice idea. Only problem is, I thought the current vogue was to have lots of
baffle thingies in the fuel tanks? Could make a game of squash quite
interesting? More likely they\'d be playing Quasar or some equivalent game,
utilising all that confinement and lack of visibility... smoke, laser
flashes (low power of course). Vodern rounds a corner, squeezes off a burst
behind him then curses as a reflected beam sets off the beeper on his chest
unit, telling him he\'s been hit. He swivels instantly - something behind
him. Ah ha! Someone\'s reprogrammed the holo-units to add in aliens again.
Nasty critters, but a single burst from his laser hitting the image and it\'s
programmed to blow apart. He sprays light into the monster, but nothing
happens. Viscous saliva drips from all-too real fangs as the creature\'s lips
draw back in a feral grin... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAaarrrgh! <blood spirts, special
effects gore... etc.>

Now wait til the others find him and realise they\'re in a huge fuel tank
with no real weapons and something very nasty...

"Flood this tank and ignite the fuel? Yes Jang, a very good idea - except
I\'d like to get out first. Where\'s the door? Anyone remember which hatch is
out and which leads into the other (full) fuel tank?"

With all of the emphasis of wilds exploration being on "lets just send a
ship out and see what we find", what about the possibilities of radio
astronomy?

Wouldn\'t it be possible to set up a radio telescope and listen in on the
radio and TV broadcasts of a few years ago for all of the worlds in your
district? What sort of signals would a world be likely to pick up if it
tried to listen in on the worlds around it?

The usual provisos of isolated signal processing computers for protection
from virus would, of course, apply.

BTW: I am still eagerly awaiting my copy of the RSB. I hope that this
isn\'t just a rehash of the longbow stuff from it.

Not to be totally flaming you, Alvin, but what I said was
that Red Zones can be designated during emergencies on
worlds with pre-existing starports.  A starport is too
permanent a structure to be erected temporarily.

Hi There.  Someone asked about Traveller: 2300 in the last issue.  I have a 
copy of 2300.  There are a few products out there for 
it (adventures and supplements).  The game is an attempt at a very "hard 
sci-fi" background.  It extrapolates earth history, complete with 
competing nations and such.  The star map it provides is probably the 
best thing about it.  It represents all the stars in a 50 ly radius 
around earth (I may have that figure wrong, but it\'s close).  The map is 
of 3D space (sacrilege!), and just looks really cool.  

I found it a bit of a rip off to call it "Traveller: 2300", it has 
nothing to do with other Traveller games, and does not fit into the 
CT/MT/TNE history line.  It\'s a completely different background, with 
different rules and technologies (no jump drives, they have something 
they call stutter warp instead).  I only played one campaign with it and 
then went back to my beloved CT.

Charles.

Why shouldn\'t they?  Pogroms, great and frightening changes, and so on. 
Maybe the coynes told them to change.  (Remember the approaching wavefront?) 
Past stability doesn\'t guarantee future stability, and stability doen\'t
necessarily mean stasis.<<

You\'ve made a good point here, Rob.  Why should the Droyne be held to the same 
set of limitations humans are?  Remember, they have an ancient history of 
extreme high-tech, extending into the upper 20s.  Maybe technological 
achievement for the Droyne is more an exercise of collective will than it is 
gradual, step-by-step achievement.  My interpretation of the big leap is that 
they collectively chose to advance themselves and drew upon their race\'s past 
achievements.  They obviously have some sort of big plan, now that they\'re 
attempting to uplift the Chirper populations to Droyne status.

The rules _are_ wrong. For contra-grav ships the G-Turns expended are

RICE  Paper							             21-1199
Gerome Rhylanor/Spinward Marches 

Physical Appearance-Gerome orbits a K2 dwarf in a highly elliptical
orbit.  The planet also has an extreme axial tilt. The eccentricity and
the the axial tilt causes severe seasonal changes.  Temperatures range
from 240K to 310K.  The planet is rugged world wracked by extremely
violent storms.  These storms kick up large amounts of metallic dust. 
This dust is very irritating to humans and other sapiens, requiring the
use of filter masks.   Sapiens who breathe the air without the aid of a
filter mask, come down with chronic lung infections as the dust
particles irritate the inner linings of the lungs and throat.  This
wind borne dust constantly erodes man made structures forcing most
dwellings below ground.   Gerome possesses no bodies of water, worthy
of being called oceans, rather it has many huge lakes.  

Biosphere-Gerome has no native animal species.  There are numerous
examples of primitive plants, similar to lichens and algae. 

History-Gerome has been a declared a Red Zone by the Imperial Navy
since 945.   The reason for the red zone were kept classified until
now.  Now under the Regent\'s new more open government the truth can be
revealed.  Gerome was established as a top secret research base in
charge of finding new military applications for biotechnologies. These
included anti-bacterial warfare agents, creating geneered animals to
serve in both combat and intelligence roles, 
methods in speeding the growth of clones, (TEXT DELETED BY ORDER OF NAVAL 
INTELLIGENCE OFFICE: ORDER 18734945-A) ,artificial RNA learning
techniques and many other projects.  The reason for the Red Zone was
simply to keep away spies and others without the Imperium\'s best
interest at heart.  In an effort to keep the existance of the base
secret, the Navy released fake UPP data on the system, falsely showing
the planet to be uninhabited.  
	  The results of the scientific experiments were filtered
through other research bases. This way the Zhodani and other enemies
would not even know that a top secret base even existed.  The Civil War
did not disrupt the research, as it was located far behind the Claw.  
In the aftermath of the Civil War, the base did suffer significant
budget cuts, but proceeded much as before.  
	In 1135 there was a major accident which would alter the world
forever.  The base had been doing research into artificial bacterial
symbiotes that would enable humans to exist in a vacuum without a
vacsuit.  The work was still far from finished, but proceeding nicely. 
On 114-1135 an explosion of still unexplained origins ripped through
the lab where the symbiote was being designed.  The symbiote was
released into the atmosphere of the planet. The high speed winds
quickly dispersed the symbiote.  Over the next few days it became
apparent the symbiote was far from finished as it infected several
thousand people across the face of the planet.   Instead of allowing
the infected to survive in a vacuum, the symbiote slowly asphyxiate d
the victim over a 
span of several hours.  By now the symbiote had been spread across the
entire surface of the planet and was thriving in the environment. It
was designed to survive in the cold vacuum of space, the atmosphere
provided more than enough heat and carbon dioxide to thrive.  An
immediate quarantine was placed around the planet.  All projects were
halted, as everyone tried to find an antidote.  Unfortunetly those
scientists who understood the symbiote best where the first to die. 
After six months, no progress had been made towards a cure and over
half the population had died.  What made the task so difficult was the
symbiote had been designed to withstand the extremes of space, high and
low temperatures, high levels of radiation and vacuum.  It could be
killed by extreme methods such as plasma bursts, but this wasn\'t a
practical method of decontamiating infected individuals.  The populace
holed up small groups in underground bunkers.  
	The Navy Commander in charge of the planet made the painful
choice to permanently close the planet.   Slowly the underground
bunkers became infected, until the population has dwindled to barely 
8000 out of 70,000 former inhabitants.  Estimates suggest that within
40 years the remaining inhabitants will perish.  A small group of
scientists still tries to find a way of defeating the symbiote, but a
solution evades their grasp, as the symbiote continues to mutate and
adapt.  The Navy maintains a squadron in the system to prevent anyone
from violating the quarantine.  It also drops frequent mercy packages
to aid the survivors. The only penalty for violating the quarantine is
life long exile to the planet.  When asked about the severe actions of
the Navy,  Cmmdr Wafoua Syoisuis replied, "Its better then dealing with
another Virus."

Society- Before the release of the symbiote, humans and other sapiens
lived in underground complexes, to avoid the dust storms, and the
extremes in weather.  It was lucky for the inhabitants, because if the
symbiote had been released on a standard world, no one would have
escaped.  Now the complexes have had 70 years to fortify themselves
against the symbiote, through complex filtering and airtight seals. 
For the most part these keep the symbiote at bay, but every 
so often something breaks down, and the complex is infected, usually
yielding a large death toll.  That is if anyone is left alive to count the bodies.  
	There are somewhere between ten and thirty complexes on Gerome.
 The average population is several hundred people.   Each complex has
grown into one extended family, with most people being related through
marriage.  The families govern the complexes through small town
meetings.   Most people never leave their complex; the possibility of
contamination arises each time someone leaves or enters.  Except for
the retrieval of Naval mercy shipments, it is only 
in the most dire of circumstances that anyone leaves a complex.  The
shipments are usually picked up by robots. When someone is forced to
leave the compound it is in airtight ATVs, when they return, the
exterior is scoured with a high temperature plasma  to kill any of the
symbiote that might have attached itself to the vehicle.   	
	The complexes keep in contact through a computer and video
network.  So while they might not be able to leave their complex, they
will be able to meet and become friends with people across the globe. 
Entertainment from around the Regency are beamed to the complexes by
the Navy.  Most inhabitants are a fairly dour and grumpy lot.  They
resent being forced to live on such a miserable planet under miserable
circumstances.  Most couples do not have children, they feel it
wouldn\'t be right to bring children into such a place.

Naval Intelligence Memo
- ----

ULTRA SECRET 
From:Cmmdr Wafoua Syoisuis : 49th Squadron  23rd Fleet Gerome
Quarantine	253-1199
To: Vice Admiral Goron Amdon :  Chief of Naval Intelligence 23rd Fleet

	My congratulations on your recent promotion, I look forward to
working with you again.  I have been asked by your predeccesor to bring
you up to date on the situation on Gerome.  We have recently created
and released a RICE Paper for public dissemination.  This paper creates
a cover story that Gerome has become infected with a dangerous
symbiote, of human creation.  For those suspicious individuals in the
press and other organizations we have created false 
evidence that the base on Gerome was researching biological warfare
agents, in violation of Emperor Martin III\'s edict.  There is nothing
concrete, just enough to suggest.  Hopefully this way suspicious
individuals will be diverted from the truth.  
	The actual story is not that much different than the official
story.  In 945 a research base was established on Gerome, not to study
biological improvements, but the geneering of psionic individuals.  
The base took several years to get established, in its early years it
did not make much progress.  It made a few minor improvements to psi
drugs and psionic shielding,  but 
nothing major.   During the Fourth Frontier War, dozens on noble
Zhodani were captured and shipped to Gerome.  These individuals
provided a large group of psions who shared a common gene pool.   These
specimens showed the researchers new approaches to their problem.  In
1088 the Beta Epsilon batch of test subjects was conceived.  By 1102 an
above average number of specimens showed psionic awareness.  The Beta
Zeta and Beta Eta batches also showed 
increased numbers of psions with increased strengths and variety of
psionic abilities.  The Beta Theta batch had to be destroyed, due to an
unforeseen mutation.  The Beta Iota batch was decanted in 1130, by 1139
the group was showing unheard of levels of psionic abilities.  Seventy
five percent were psioniclly  active, with psionic strengths of five to
ten, with three cases of 
strengths of 18.  The Beta Kappa and Beta Lambda batches were rushed
into production.  During the summer of 1148 the Beta Iota individuals,
turned 18.  In the next year they started to show signs of mental instabilities. 
	The researchers carefully watched the Beta Kappa and Beta
Lambda groups. Both groups showed immense psionic strengths, and not
just in the common psionic abilities, but in many different Arcane
abilities.  Unfortunetly they also developed mental instabilities, even
earlier than in the Beta Iota group.  These include megalomania,
paranoia, schizophrenia, autism, mental retardation, multiple
personality disorder and obsessive compulsive behavior.  Production 
of the Beta Mu and Beta Nu batches were immediately halted, while a
solution was sought.  
	The researchers only had 6 months, before the Betas created
their own solution.  Led by a Beta Iota named Alexandra, they revolted.
 Most of the researchers were killed, the remaining were captured and
held as hostage.  Some of the Betas wanted to trade the hostages for a
ship in which they would roam the galaxy.  Alexandra put a halt to this
talk by incinerating the group\'s 
chief spokesman.  She then declared herself Emperor of the Known
Universe, and ordered a halt to contact with the "...mind deaf
Imperials."  She ordered that the Beta Mu, and Beta Nu batches be put
into production, and she ordered the creation of a Beta Xi group, which
consisted entirely of clones of herself.  Alexandra suffered from
megalomania and paranoia, a particularly dangerous 
combination in a leader, especially when the leader  is a telepathic pyrotechnic. 
	The Commodore of  the orbiting squadron was on planet during
the revolt and was executed by Emperor Alexandra personally.  There was
quite a debate among the surviving Naval captains on how to react to
the revolt.  Some wanted to act with massive force and crush the
planet.  Others wanted to mount a rescue attempt, and then crush the
planet.  A few wanted to negotiate a settlement.  Finally a rescue
attempt was decided on.  The attempt was a dismal failure.  Two
companies of assault marines landed on the planet.  Though equipped with battle 
dress with integral psionic shielding, the marines were butchered by
the psions. Psionic shielding only slows down a strength 15 psion, and
it does nothing against telekinetic wielded plasma guns. 
	Upon hearing of the defeat, Subsector Command issued orders
calling for a temporary quarantine of the planet.  After several months
of debate, it was ordered that the quarantine be made permanent, and
the planet kept under constant surveillance.  It was thought that the
undesirable mental traits would be winnow ed from the gene pool, by
natural selection.   Even if this did not happen, the Navy would be
able to study to see the long term biological effects of psionics. 
	The quarantine is maintened by the 49th Squadron of the 23rd
Regency Fleet.  The planet is monitored by a series of orbiting
satellites.  Yearly, missions to the planet are mounted, These are
crewed solely by remotely controlled robots.  Each robot has a self
destruct mechanism, in case a 
psion with machine empathy manages to take control of the robot.  These
missions trade needed resources for information that can not be
gathered from orbit.  Some complexes await the missions with
anticipation, others try to destroy the missions, for what ever goals
they might have.  Occasionally the missions capture a psion and bring
back the specimen for in depth analysis.  The 
49th Squadron if fairly strong. That is both to keep intruders out of
the system, and also to keep the Betas from escaping.  In 1183 the Beta
group known as the Avengers of Korn tried to launch a small solid fuel
rocket into orbit.  The cruiser Cranston was able to destroy it, but
several psions were able to teleport to the Cranston, they caused
extensive damage before being eliminated.  
	Since the revolt, life has not been good for the inhabitants of
Gerome.  It is standard procedure for experimental geneered individuals
to be sterilized at birth. This way the gene pool is strictly
controlled by the scientists in charge.  Early Betas such as
individuals from the Beta Beta and Beta Gamma batches, were used as lab
assistants at the research base.  These individuals 
were able to create new batches of Betas, which were fully fertile.  
The other major problem for the Betas was food.  Most food for the
research was grown on planet, but it required a great deal of foreign
assistance.  After several lean years, the Betas were able to create a stable food 
supply.   Though it is precarious and does not make for a varied diet.   
	The society of the psions is quite chaotic, as fits a mentally
unstable population.  The population consists of approximately 12,000
individuals.  These are gathered into 12 major groups of about 800
psions each, and 25 minor groups of varying size.  Each group does not
possess enough food, manufacturing, medical and technological resources
to be self sufficient.  Most groups trade to get access to the
neccesary resources.  A few, especially of the smaller bands, 
resort to raiding, and banditry.  Local manufacturing is at TL 8, with
large amounts of high tech equipment still on planet.  The structure of
each of these bands is quite varied, some are democratic, some are
ruled by self proclaimed Queens, Dalis, Gods, and Lord Emperors, others
are simply ruled by the strongest.  The clones of Emperor Alexandra
have created a complex inhabited solely by clones of the original
Alexandra, who is kept alive in low berth.  It is considered one of the
more insane complexes.  Due to the sheer number of sociopaths, violent
crime is epidemic, most groups have incorporated this into their
society, through ritual challenges,  registered assassins and blood duels.

Traveller 2300 and was set 300 years after Twillight 2000.  It used a new
game system that had fun detailed but quick charater generation, and was
GDW\'s first foray into the D10 world.  They did a good job with the game,
especially with the background.  If you want excellent aliens, fleshed out
worlds, and a fairly realistic Colonial System combined with good space
combat (inertialess drives), and a plethora of weapons, then 2300AD is the
game for you.  There is still a bit of source material around, and GDW
"promises" to update the material for the new "house system".

Perhaps the finest point of the game is that GDW uses the actual stars
around Sol to build the universe.  They use a 3D starmap to show the tracks
humans have taken out to the stars.  The aliens are diverse and strange.
There is only 1 race that has achieved star travel, and they are implacable
foes.  

The one comment a friend of mine had for it was "its sort of like Aliens."

I rather liked it, but it is definately not Space Opera.

Quite possible.  At least you could find out if there is any current 
technological civilization there: I there are no spare starships, this 
may also me the only means of contact with the outside universe.

Sorry: I mean that the Red Zone can be errected temporarily.
Out of curiosity, couldn\'t "E" ports be errected temporarily? (Seeing 
that they use so little equipement anyways..."

I just happened to notice while looking for a world starting with "A" in
the RSB that there\'s an entry in the world index for a world in that hex
in 1202 named "Ayordeldold".  I also found this name in the HIWG draft UWPs
when I checked.  Of course, the world doesn\'t appear in the UWPs or on
the map, as Hyphen mentioned.  Appropriately, it\'s in Mora subsector just
jump-1 from CP GHOST.  :)  The plot thickens....

About Droyne tech-levels:

There\'s a comment in Secret of the Ancients that mentions that one of the
errands Yaskoydray ran on his regular trips outside his hidey-hole was to
visit former Droyne worlds and demolish what was left of the Ancients\'
industrial base.  I\'d think that having Grandfather stop by every time
you started to pick up the pieces and smash you back into the Stone Age
would tend to encourage a pastoral life-style.  He hasn\'t shown up for
fifty thousand years or so now, and maybe peer-pressure from the other 
starfaring races has got them interested in technology again.

That map\'s accuracy is questionable, though; at least one well-known
star (either Epsilon Eridani or 40 Eridani) in the region is missing,
for example. Plus, the map\'s utility is reduced by their renaming
certain stars and not giving present-day equivalents (like "Queen
Alice\'s Star").

Not true! The Pentapods have star travel and the Ebers used to have
star travel.

For my money, though, the truly cool aliens are the Ylii, the Kafer
slave "race" detailed in the _Kafer Sourcebook_ and more extensively in
the four-part adventure in Challenge 49-52.

keep it company. (stand and shack optional).

I also think that E class ports can be erected temporarily, either 
in emergency cases or starting colony, trying to establish trade..etc.

Well, it\'s more of case to case basis.  For example, for my writeup for 
Apollo (Aubaine subsector) the E class starport is infact an old lab ship 
that was converted by the Admin. Terrotry officals to handle the traffic 
in the system.  E class ports, to me, add in a wide variation to the 
game.  They can be either dirtside: converted ships buried in the ground 
type, a patch of dirt or water-based installition.   Or space-based.  an 
old BB serves as the local E port, an astroid whatever..  

Are there any examples of E class ports in the traveller history (World 
writeups?)

I like that!  you should add it up to your next RICE paper, eh?

On the same note, did anyone attempt to design a starport installtion 
using FF&S?  Lets say a class-D port? 

Is it worth the work?

An "E" port is defined somewhere as a marked spot of 
bedrock, with no facilities, bases, or fuel present.  Maybe 
there\'s a beacon.  That sounds like something potentially 
temporary, especially if it\'s in a jungle.  

Adventure seed: Looking for the "E" starport on a planet,
that has become overgrown with jungle.  "Well, the 1120
IGS chart says that there is a class E starport at map
coordinates xyz.  Because the GPS satellites have long
since crashed, we\'re not too sure where xyz is, but we can
guess based on terrain, old records, and latitude 
measurements.  Surely it\'s not under the oceans.  I hope 
something worthwhile is down there."

From: Christopher_Griffen_at_DMC-SJ3@dmcwave.com (Christopher Griffen)
Subject: Grandfather, the Sparklers/Primordials, and Longbow
Sender: traveller@MPGN.COM

As for the Sparklers/Primordials, you\'ll need to obtain a copy of the somewhat 
rare MegaTraveller Journal #4.  In the letters page, DGP describes what they 
intended to do with this mysterious creatures who apparently make the Ancients 
look like minor leaguers.  Though Dave Nilsen has hinted that he doesn\'t intend 
to use the Primordials in TNE, he hasn\'t exactly said he won\'t for certain.

Personally, I hope the Primordials _do_ play a part in TNE.  I don\'t buy Dave\'s 
and other GDWers\' arguments that the Ancients should never have been fleshed out
because it "took away the mystery" or whatever.  When you\'re dealing with the 
depths of space, there\'s always more mystery.

--Chris
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

IMO, the mistake was not in fleshing out the Ancients, although I\'ve always
believed that the \'Grandfather\' ploy was pretty lame, but in not cooking up
a new mystery to take their place. DGP may have been trying to correct this
by introducing the Primordials.

   The Eternal Guardian is a massive aircraft.  Its immense size
is dictated by its power supply, a nuclear reactor. It can stay airborne
for over 1 month at a time.  It was originally designed as part of a 
nuclear deterent.  It would be constantly flying, this way it would 
avoid being caught on the ground by a suprise attack. Upon receiving orders
it could enter enemy airspace and deliver its nuclear payload.  It would
deal with enemy air defenses, with tactical nuclear weapons that would
take out entire enemy air fields, and SAM sites.  
   Many TEDs in the wilds have found other uses for such a massive weapon.
It can be used as a propaganda weapon, constantly flying over rebellous
provences and broadcasting propaganda, or jamming alternative viewpoints.
Some Eternal Guardians have been equipped with video broadcasting suites,
to increase the effectivness of the propaganda.  It can also be used 
for its original purpose, to bomb something into the stone age.

Fuel Consumption: 20 tonnes of radioactive-s per 37 day period.
Internal Fuel Capacity: 20 tonnes.
Endurance: 37 days.
Range: 437124 km
Takeoff Roll: 5031 m   (2566 m with JATO unit)
Landing Roll: 2414 m
 
JATO: Jet Assisted Take Off 
This is  20 tonne TL-8 solid fuel rocket. It adds 109 tons of thrust
for 2 minutes.  This reduces the take off roll to 2566 meters.  It costs
40,000 cr.
The JATO isn\'t just one big rocket, probably a collection of smaller ones. 
Ten sounds like a good number, that way they would each weight 2 tonnes.  They
would be mounted on each side of the body of the jet.  They would fall off after
takeoff, and land via parachutes. They could be retrived and resused,
like the Space Shuttles Booster rockets are.

Well, here we go.

If GDW tanks (in, say, three or so years), should we largely keep the New 
Era setting, or simply revert back to pre-Rebellion Traveller with New Era 
rules?  Or try for something completely different? (ie. collapse without 
Virus, Lucan winning the Civil War, etc.)  

Even though I\'m a Classic setting fan, the New Era does have it\'s 
strengths (even the RC!), and it would be interesting to see "what\'s 
going to happen next?"

In the end, it depends if we want a static setting (which can be deepened 
greatly) ot a fluid setting (where the focus is on the extraordinary changes 
going around you, rather than deepening and enriching the background and 
the enormous canvass that Traveller presents).

Assuming anyone here can handle publishing it, either as a hobby 
[remember those cheap little black books!] for fellow Traveller fans, or
as a going financial concern (doubtful).

As for the accuracy of the starmap, it is a darn sight better then the
starmap provided w/ Traveller.  Even if it does have a few inaccuracies
(sort of a GDW trademark after all) I prefer it to the map of the Solomani Rim.

I believe the qualification was that none of the other Aliens save the
Kafers has STAR travel.  There were a couple of races with Space Travel,
although the Ebers did at one time have Stutterwarp (I believe their
homeworld was destroyed).  In Traveller parlance, they would be minor races.
My favorite Aliens were the Pentapods which believed that anything tech
could do they could geneer better.  How about those Bio-Samplers cute cuddly
and Ohh so useful, or the living Artificial Gill Something I would put on my
face (NOT).

"Several individual Tigresses [500 kton dreadnaughts] have 
been deployed among the worlds of the Five Sisters 
subsector to enforce the amber zone blockade of Candory and 
Andor."

Supplement 9, Fighting Ships, at 38.

The reference to "amber zone" I assume to be a
proofreading error, but what about a blockade requiring
"several" of the "largest line-of-battle vessel[s]
currently in service with the Imperial Navy in the
Spinward Marches"?  

Is the Imperium trying to keep something from getting out
of Andor and Candory, or trying to keep someone from
getting in?  Or is it really just a cover or excuse for
building up Imperial forces on the opposite side of the
Sword Worlds? 

Does anyone recall seeing anything else about a 
heavily-enforced "blockade" of Andor and Candory in any 
other materials?  (I didn\'t see anything in the Droyne Alien 
Supplement, nor in Alien Realms.)

And, of course, I solicit your thoughts on the Thyo Supud

I doubt it\'s going to take 3 years. I think the ship was taking on water when
Marc Miller left & is now going down.

I would prefer that we revert to, say, 1115 & assume that those worthless louts
at IRIS had done their jobs & the Rebellion had never happened. As a second choice
I would have the Rebellion happen but be crushed by Lucan\'s initial attack & then
have Lucan assasinated by a Dulinor die-hard mole & have Margaret assume the throne
to deal with the various border problems that would have cropped up by then.

        The Tacitus is an Imperial design widely produced during the 5th
Frontier War. It was designed primarily as an export comodity to allow
lower tech level worlds to supplement their Shukugan (Dragon) Squadrons.
As the Tacitus is designed at TL-14, extensive training and support programs
were offered as part of the Tacitus sales package.

    'body' => 'I would like to congratulate Alvin Plummer for a job well-done.  This is 
quite rare, as I do not agree with most of his views on Traveller and 
Traveller:TNE.  However, his comparison of his light cruiser design
with the RC modular vessel was particularly well written, and made far 
more interesting reading than just another vessel description.  I do
not spend much time designing ships and have not played either BL
or BR, so I generally have little interest in the ship descriptions.

But I know enough about the weaponry, numbers, and design 
issues to follow the discussion, and the comparisons were 
well-wrought (even if I did not agree completely with all points 
made).  Anyone with any interest in ships (not as units in a
board game, but as ships) could understand and enjoy the
article.  Thank you, Alvin, for providing interesting reading.

Dave leaving will rob them of a major TNE writer, and a good one at
that. H+I had its problems, but Survival Margin and RSB are great.
I wonder how this will effect the release schedule? 

"The Guilded Lily - coming December 2001"?

Talking of Releases, I was on the line to GDW a week or so ago. The
release schedule was:

Guilded lily - Nov 95.

Regency Vehicle Guide - Dec 95.

Reformation Coalition Player\'s Handbook - Dec 95.

Regency Starship Guide - Jan 96.

All these are 48 pages, and 12 dollars each.

As for Challenge stopping at 79, why? Any copies that reach our local quickly 
evaporate, unlike Inphobia (R.I.H.), Dragon, White Dwarf, and others. The
Market will be left with no Science Fiction RPG magazine at all. Perhaps
GDW could just officially go bi-yearly?

Another thing, in the not too distant past, GDW mailed the list occasionally
to let us know of developments in TNE and the company in general. Of late
though they seem to be ignoring the list, and they\'ve never answered any
e-mails I\'ve sent them. Don\'t they care about their fans, the people who
buy their products? Maybe TML\'er should e-mail GDW en-masse and fill the
subject line with : \'Whats up?\'

Getting kind of exasperated at GDW,

Eamon Watters.

Easy.  Using jump drive, they move ahead of the wave.  After witnessing the 
effects of the wave, jump-drive equipped craft jump to systems that have not yet
been reached and tell others what\'s coming.

You\'d think anyone with psionics, like for instance the entire Zho nobility, 
would get the heck out of there before the Wave comes and fries their brain.

I had a player with more money than sense...
It can be done, relatively easily. No, it\'s not really worth the work. If
you have World Tamer\'s handbook, then you could use the rules for
industrial production to make a yard facility. I used a volume of 14 kl per
ton of installations (none is given in WTH).

I was rather disappointed that, unlike some other publications in the field
(Pyramid springs to mind), Challenge 77 had no mention whatsoever of its
absurd lateness, happenings at GDW, etc.: merely an issue in a vacuum.  That,
if anything, is the way to scare off potential buyers/subscribers, when they
don\'t know what\'s happening or why.

I don\'t think Dave Nilsen\'s departure is necessarily a death-knell for GDW
(nor do I think Marc Miller\'s portended it -- from what I heard, he just
wanted/needed to make some more money).  I\'ve enjoyed many of GDW\'s releases,
but their deep silence concerning goings-on, schedules, etc. is disturbing.

Might it be that the long-ago Mythus lawsuit hurt them worse than they
admitted, and we\'re only now seeing the fallout?

PHYSICAL: 
     Capon, viewed from orbit, is an attractive blue-green world. 
The visitor may notice the vast ice fields that cover large areas 
of the land masses.  Also of note are the World Spine Mountains, a 
famed destination for sport climbers for centuries. 
     Capon has a thin atmosphere, with a almost non-existent ozone 
layer.  Caponese life has adapted to the harsh conditions, and the 
colonists all tend to be of a very dark shade.  Travellers, however, 
must take precautions against high UV levels.  Since much of the 
valley is snow-covered throughout the year, exposed human eyes can 
suffer permanent damge in a matter of minutes due to "snow blindness". 
Eye protection is a must, and either fully covering garments or a 
strong sunblock is needed to avoid a painful melanoma. 
     There are two main continents; Nord, which is ice bound, and 
Pillagi, where most settlement has occurred along the Lanzecki river 
basin.  The Lanzecki, which flows 12,000km from the World Spine to 
the Hester Ocean, is a meandering, slow river.  Its flood plain 
provides for much of the agricultural output of the world. 
 
HISTORY:  
     Capon was settled in 124, with colonists drawn from the Deneb 
sector.  The first colony failed within 50 years due to poor 
planning.  In 180, an Imperial Navy base was started on the site 
of the first colony.  Ministry of Colonization officials scoured 
the area for colonists who could stand the extreme UV levels.  The 
result was one of the oddest collections of people ever to settle 
a world.  While regulations were followed in skills available and 
male-female ratios, etc.; most of the colonists had never met each 
other until they were on the transports.  The second colony was 
established in the Lanzecki River\'s broad delta region.  After 
clearing the heavy jungle, the region was found to be very fertile, 
supporting a wide variety of crops along with aquaculture. 
     The Second Frontier War saw the invasion of Capon by Sword 
Worlds forces.  An attempt to deny the Naval Base to the Imperium, 
the occupation led to a bitter guerilla war that last three years 
(617-620).  The Occupation, as it is remembered, has left a lasting 
dislike of off-worlders in general and Sword Worlders in particular. 
 
SOCIETY: 
     Caponese society is best characterized as conservative and 
polite.  Manners are considered to be of paramount importance in 
social situations.  Rudeness will rarely result in violence, but 
the offender will be ignored.  Caponese dress in head-to-toe outfits, 
rarely exposing skin to the harmful rays of Cyr.  Since UV 
protection goggles are mandatory, it is considered very rude to look 
an ungoggled person in the eyes.  Among family and close friends, 
however, there is no nudity taboo.  Indeed, communal bathing is part 
of the Brushlander culture. 
     There are two distinct sub-cultures on Capon; the majority who 
live in the Lanszeki valley, and the Brushlanders who follow the 
Basa herds.  Brushlanders are nomadic, living in massive ATVs.  They 
use kians and light grav vehicles to monitor their stock. 
     Brushlanders barely acknowledge the existence of the world 
government, preferring their own clan structure.  Most Brushlander 
clans consist of several families of 40-60 individuals.  Brushlander 
and mainstream Caponese come together annually when the clans bring 
their herds into railheads for auction.  At these times, the clan 
council judges disputes between families, allocates goods and profit 
from the sale, and makes arrangements for clan members who wish to 
leave for any reason (usually the clan member is welcome to return 
at any time). 
 
GOVERNMENT: 
     Capon is governed by a Senate that controls appointments to 
various posts.  The world is divided into four districts, with 
Burton\'s Landing constituting a seperate district of its own.  Seats 
are allocated based on a districts economic output, resulting in a 
constant shift in the balance of power.  The Senators from each 
district elect one of their number to serve on the Executive Council, 
this body holds the purse strings of the Treasury. 
     The Senate is popularly elected every five years.  Elections 
are staggered, so that any given year 1/5 of the seats are contested. 
Caponese politics are fractious, with several candidates vying for 
any given seat.  One wit observed:  "Caponese are polite to a fault, 
and that fault is politics." 
     Everyday administration is handled by various Ministies. 
Ministers are appointed by the Senate, and nepotism seems to be the 
rule.  Lower-level bureaucrats are found through civil service exams, 
and tend to make up for their superiors\' failings. 
     Law enforcement is under the supervision of the Ministry of 
Justice and the National Police.  Laws are mainly intended to 
preserve order, and allow for a wide range of expression.  Police 
tend to be armed with non-lethal weapons, and act more as mediators 
whenever possible.  Those arrested will be tried before a tribunal 
consisting of a Senator, a police official, and a citizen selected at 
random.  The accused are considered innocent until proven guilty. 
Punishment is slated more towards conspicuous public service and 
embarrassment. 
 
VISITING CAPON: 
     The first thing a visitor to Capon will notice is the small 
orbital port.  Currently being upgraded as part of the Phase 2 
Starport project, the Up-port is crowded for a class A facility. 
Once cleared by the RQS and Caponese Customs, your ship will land at 
the First Try Memorial Starport.  Built on the site of the failed 
colony, the main terminal has an interesting display of artifacts 
found during the port\'s construction in the late 700s.  Ground 
transport to the capital of Burton\'s Crossing is usually handled by 
high speed Mag-Lev trains, but an option for the traveller with more 
time is a trip up river on one of the many cruise ships. 
     Once in Burton\'s Crossing, (pop: 6.4 million) there are a variety 
of hotels and entertainments.  It is important to remember that acts 
perceived as rude will result in a shunning, even from merchants and 
police.  Most of the planets economic activity is handled here, rather 
than at the starport, due to the nature of the world\'s exports.  A 
brisk futures market can be found in the Poolside district, and is 
fascinating to watch.

    'from' => 'Franklin Cain',
    'body' => '	The Scout Service of the Last Imperium had two primary functions:
Exploratin and communications.  The purpose of exploration is clearly
substantiated by the huge number of relic scout/couriers.  So whatever
happened to all of the X-Boats and their Tenders?

	First of all, the X-Boats and Tenders had massive amounts of
electronics (as befits a moile communications post).  Thus, they were
greatly susceptible to Virus infestation.  In fact, a major avenue of
Virus propagation was the X-Boat Network.  Therefore, the majority of
X-Boats and Tenders were casualties to Virus.  But that still leaves us
with a large number of X-Boats and a lesser number of Tenders to account
for. 

	In the Post-Collapse universe, most X-Boats will be greatly valued
as reserves of spare parts (just as the Covenant of Sufren is doing with
the jump drives from its larger naval vessels).  However, a pocket empire
might maintain one or two X-Boats as a special high-jump courier. 
Tenders, on the other hand, will probably be used as fuel shuttles (with
their hangar bay reconfigured as extra fuel tankage).  While you consider
the implications of this, let me bring up something else.  

	A major problem faced by the Reformation Coalition is the
restriction on travel within the RC imposed by the astrography.  For
example, for a typical jump-2 ship (such as a far trader or a
scout/courier) takes eight jumps to travel from Oriflamme to Spencer (see
figure 1 below), crossing the RC border to do so, even though Spencer was
only three parsecs away!  If the same ship goes from Baldur to Helios, the
trip involves four jumps, again crossnig the RC border, and again the
destination was only three parsecs away.  Going from Nike Nimbus to the RC
Navy HQ at Aurora takes four jumps, once again crossing the RC border (but
this time, our destination was four parsecs away).  What does this have to
do with relic X-Boat Tenders?

	Suppose the RC NAvy were to commission two squadrons (with one
Tender [Tanker version; see below] each) to service deep-space refueling
depots.  One squadron ("Sahara Squadron") would be based out of Baldur and
would service 0833 and 1034.  The other ("Gobi Squadron") would be based
out of Shenandoah and would service 0938 and 1137.  From 0833, Sahara
Squadron would connect Kruyter, Eos, Nike Nimbus, Enkidu, and Baldur (see
figure 2 below); from 1034, Sahara Squadron would connect Baldur, Helios,
Oriflamme, Spires, and Zloga.  From 0938, Gobi Squadron would connect
Aubaine, Phoebus, Spires, Lucifer, and Shenandoah; from 1137, Gobi
Squadron would connect Oriflamme, Spires, Zloga, and Shenandoah.  Also,
within each squadron, both deep-space refueling locations would be within
jump-2 distance of one another.  Thus, someone wanting to go from
Oriflamme to Eos could do so in just three jumps!

	Initially, each deep-space refueling site would be uilt from the
following Clipper Modules (from the RC equipment Guide, plus the update(s)
in _Challenge_ magazine):

		1x 25-ton Lifeboat Module (for the emergenct low 
			berths and the radio)
		1x 25-ton Missile Module (for self-defense as well
			as for the Active and Passive EMS arrays)
		2x 25-ton VIP Quarters Modules (for accomodations)
		1x 50-ton Service Module for 10-ton Small Craft
			(for the skiff and the machine shop)
		4x 100-ton Fuel Modules (for fuel tankage)

	Eventually, each site would replace the Small Craft Service Module
and both of the VIP Quarters Modules with a 200-ton Quarters Module Mk IIa
(for the rec deck, the radio, the sickbay, and the skiff); furthermore,
each site would get an additional 6x 100-ton Fuel Modules (bringing the
total number of such Fuel Modules per site to ten each).  Initially, both
Squadrons would have onlu one Tanker each to service both of their
deep-space sites; eventually, another two Tankers (one per Squadron)
should be assigned.  The eight-week schedule for both Squadrons would look
like this:

	Weeks 1-2:  Sahara Squadron returns to Baldur and refuels; Gobi
Squadron returns to Shenandoah and refuels

	Weeks 3-4:  Sahara-1 jumps to 0833 and unloads fuel; Gobi-1 jumps
to 0938 and unloads fuel; (Sahara-2 and Gobi-2, if available, would
service 1034 and 1137, respectively)

	Weeks 5-6:  (as Weeks 1-2 above)

	Weeks 7-8:  Sahara-1 jumps to 1034 and unloads fuel; Gobi-1 jumps
to 1137 and unloads fuel; (Sahara-2 and Gobi-2, if available, would
service 0833 and 0938, respectively)

	This is an article I sent to Dave Nilsen several months ago.  He
liked my idea of a deep-space refueling program for the RC (the Centrists
should *really* go for it).  He said he was giving this to Michelle Sturgeon,
the editor for _Challenge_ magazine, to see if she wanted to print it.
However, since I haven\'t heard anything from Ms Sturgeon, I thought I
would send this copy to the readers of this mailing list.

	If you like this idea, please let me know.  Constructive
criticisms greatly appreciated!

	Thank you.

No problemo.  The real problem is for me to try to keep in mind the 
strong points in the arguments of the pro-RC/New Era camp.  Difficult, 
due to extreme emotional bias, but it can be done... temporarily.

Actually, I was hoping for a lot more flames.  Although I love ship 
design and naval architecture, I have yet to play any BL/BR games, and 
was hoping that those with real, regular experience with BL/BR would 
point out where I messed up.  

Actually, when you get down to it, I have never even played/GM\'ed a 
Traveller game! No, really!  School and work has usually taken up my 
time, and I prefer designing worlds, ships, etc. to playing in them. Call 
me a frustrated SF writer, or an artist without the disipline to truly 
bring his visions to life.

All my observations were based on some deductive thought, basic common 
sense (sorta) and intuition, coupled with some grasp of the rules.

You\'re very welcome.  I try to please, but suspect that I\'m more likely to 
publicly make a fool of myself than properly illustrate the ideas in my 
head.  

Anyways, I find it deeply satisfying to put my ideas on the TML list - 
where anyone who likes them can use them -  rather than left gathering dust, 
locked away in my files and folders.  And if you don\'t like them, make 
your own and post them here!

        What about the power of the medium we\'re using right now? There\'s
half-a-dozen Web sites that could continue to publish "official" Traveller
material ... the only question would be who gets to decide what\'s official
if GDW augers in.

As for Challenge stopping at 79, why? Any copies that reach our local quickly 
evaporate, unlike Inphobia (R.I.H.), Dragon, White Dwarf, and others. The
Market will be left with no Science Fiction RPG magazine at all. Perhaps
GDW could just officially go bi-yearly?
========================================

I suspect it\'s financial. Printers need to paid.
================================================

Another thing, in the not too distant past, GDW mailed the list occasionally
to let us know of developments in TNE and the company in general. Of late
though they seem to be ignoring the list, and they\'ve never answered any
e-mails I\'ve sent them. Don\'t they care about their fans, the people who
buy their products? Maybe TML\'er should e-mail GDW en-masse and fill the
subject line with : \'Whats up?\'

Getting kind of exasperated at GDW,

Eamon Watters.
=============================

You & me both. I\'m not surprised though. I think alot of folks there
are "seeing the handwriting on the wall". It\'s bound to affect their
motivation.

I\'m thinking of something that a survey mission would leave in orbit, be

device would have to be fairly self-sufficient for long periods.  No 
engines would be necessary.
The design I\'ve slowly been working on (my first experiment with FF&S)

I also think that E class ports can be erected temporarily, either 
in emergency cases or starting colony, trying to establish trade..etc.

Well, it\'s more of case to case basis.  For example, for my writeup for 
Apollo (Aubaine subsector) the E class starport is infact an old lab ship 
that was converted by the Admin. Terrotry officals to handle the traffic 
in the system.  E class ports, to me, add in a wide variation to the 
game.  They can be either dirtside: converted ships buried in the ground 
type, a patch of dirt or water-based installition.   Or space-based.  an 
old BB serves as the local E port, an astroid whatever..  

Are there any examples of E class ports in the traveller history (World 
writeups?)

The old CT adventure (double adv?) \'Mission on Mithril\' detailed a class
E port on the world & it was pretty much the way Michael described it, as
I recall.

you have read it.

Expect it to come not from this address but my other one 
(paul.radford@nottingham.ac.uk). But either address is possible.
If it is too large for mail servers to handle, then something will have to
be sorted out.

I don\'t mind if anyone wants to add the adventure to an homepage or FTP
site. All i ask is that it retains my name on it.

It seems that there might be a receptive audience for adventures (not just
adventure seeds), and perhaps others have adventures that they would like to
share?

As my campaign is RC based then I would appreciate any adventures that
anyone may have set in this region of space. Regency material would be nice
too in case  I start an alternate campaign.

Thanks everyone.

What about Drop tanks?  These effectively allow a "free" jump.  By 
establishing a large supply of standard drop tanks at a given Starport and 
suppling tenders to collect the dropped tanks, all ships that pay for the service
can do a double jump when leaving the starport.

I still thnk that any military/government force is going to want secret refuelling points in deep space to guarantee that important messages etc get through.  These would be implimented as you describe (except their exact location wouldn\'t be generally known...

Adventure seed: The PCs are returning from some routine government 
business that requires them to use one of  these secret refuelling points, 
however when they jump in the refuelling ship(s) are lifeless hulks.  To get 
home the players have to salvage jump-fuel from the wreakage, carefully 
checking for undamaged tanker holds and draining each with makeshift fuel 
connections in a debris-strewn vaccum enviornment (can anyone say suit 
repair patch?).  Then the problem is to find out how/why the refuelling ships are
 destroyed.  I smell the virus... or could it be due to infighting between political 
factions in the pocket empire (It\'s good to hurt someone in a place they can\'t 
admit exists)...or even, an old foe waiting to capture the players (in this case 
there isn\'t enough jump-fuel remaining for them to escape...or is there)

Wow.

There\'s been an unusual number of messages lately about GDW 
instead of about Traveller... I must have missed a few things
though.

Where is Dave N. going?
Someone said they called GDW to order a copy of TNE and GDW said
it\'s out of print! Could TNE be _permanently_ out of print?

Anyways, I hope GDW doesn\'t go the way of DGP, as I doubt Roger
Sanger has enough spare change to buy the rights to all of GDW\'s
Traveller material too. :)

Also, are there any list-lurkers in Ottawa out there who would
be interested in playing in the new year? Care to start commuting
up here for the odd game, Alvin?

Wrong?  I\'d say that you\'re doing it exactly the right way.  You do have
options, of course.  For example, some beacons reasonably close to the
system primary may use solar collectors instead of fusion power plants for
power...they\'d be cheaper too.  

You may want to add a couple of small thrusters for
station-keeping...perhaps ion drives (FF&S pp71-72), as their power
requirements are low.  0.01g thrust should be enough.

More advanced versions could add optical sensors and a small computer so
that positional information is continually checked an updated.  These types
of beacons would have been very common in the Last Imperium.

Hmmm...interesting idea, I think I\'ll have a play around.

    'body' => 'Following on from Andy Davis\' post regarding satellite beacons, I\'ve (very
quickly) knocked up two examples.  Both use fusion power plants, and the
radio beacon itself is by far the greatest consumer of power.

URLI Model 44B satellite beacon (TL-12)

Size:   2 tons (28 m^3)
Mass:   55.34t
Power:  22MW Fusion power plant
Equip:  1 x 1000 AU radio transmitter
        1 x 60,000km passive EMS
        1 x Mod. 12 Flt computer.
Price:  MCr 3.825/3.055 (quantity)

The URLI 44B is representative of a great number of satellie navigations
deployed throughout the Last Imperium.  The 44B is typically deployed at
system jump and gas giant refuelling points, it\'s powerful radio transmitter
can be detected from anywhere in the system.

Passive EMS and optical sensors provide information to the Model 12 Flt
computer, which continually updates positional and navigational data.
Transmissions are fully programmable, normally by remote transmission to the
unit\'s inbuilt radio receiver.

The satellite contains a low thrust (0.01G) ion drive for station keeping,
and sufficient ionizates for 10,000 hours operation.  Power plant fuel is
sufficient 5 years operation.

The 44B has 4 m^3 and 1.39 MW spare capacity, which can be used for a
variety of applications.

URLI Model 43 satellite beacon (TL-12)

Size:   1 ton (14 m^3)
Mass:   33.26t
Power:  12MW fusion power plant
Equip:  1 x 300,000km radio transmitter
        1 x 60,000km passive EMS
        1 x Mod. 12 Flt computer
Price:  Mcr 2.623/2.098 (quantity)        

The URLI 43 is a smaller version of the 44B, using a less powerful radio
transmitter.  The Model 43 is typically deployed in  far orbit around the
system\'s mainworld, and provides realtime navigational and traffic control
data.  The Model 43 is also deployed in great numbers on the surface of many
worlds - providing instant \'E\' class starport facilities to any cleared area
where it is deployed.

The ion thruster and power plant fuel specs are identical to that of the
Model 44B.

The 43 has 0.5 m^3 and 0.39 MW spare capacity.

Well reasoned and presented.  My question is: would these refueling

        Interesting data. I am also running a campaign in Near Bootes area,
        but I had\'t collapsed the whole sector yet. The main problem is that
        I don\'t have enough data about the real stars in capella sector, and
        it is impossible to create correct World Tamer values for each star
        system without this information. I would greatly appreciate if someone
        with access to good source material would post a list of corresponding
        star names. (That is, "the Tarsus star system is DM???", etc.)

        Currently my campaign is mostly running around Saxe, Vantage and
        Vyborg. This is because Vantage and Vyborg were probably the only
        systems in Capella sector that were described in old Classic Traveller
        materials.

        PS. The native finnish name for Vyborg is "Viipuri". The name "Vyborg"
        is just an english (or galanglic) way to call it.

I was thinking about the Imperial Blockade of A+C - perhaps the reason
for the blocade is that the Imperials don\'t want the Droyne expanding out
of A+C and introducing another Psionic state into the Spinward Marches.
Also, they\'d gobble up worlds that the Imperium would want for themselves.

The Tigresses would probably prevent large ships suitable for colonization
from leaving.

How this policy would evolve into the new era - I don\'t know, but A+C\'s tech
increase could possibly indicate they are preparing to  expand outwards.

after the Vampire Fleets sourcebook. Of course we, on this group, can 
still backup non-copyrighted material onto the WWW, FTP sites etc, 
providing we have the permission of the authors first.

What I would like is for DGP to pick up the rights to Traveller. What 
limited material I have bought from them has been of the highest quality 
(Alien Sourcebooks Vol 1+2, WBH etc) and Ive missed Blair Reynolds

>Are there any examples of E class ports in the traveller history (World 
>writeups?)

The world 567-908 in Safari Ship had one.  A patch of exposed bedrock in
a region filled with same was designated the "starport".  There was an
antenna a few meters high connected to a sealed underground transmitter 
and a log recorder so ships could voluntarily leave records of comings
and goings and their flight plans.  That\'s it.  No buildings, no people,
and nothing else.

Mithril had one that was verging on D status.  It actually marked the 
landing area, threw up a couple of buildings, had a port warden and a
maintenance shed with some heavy equipment and parts!  It didn\'t have
a tank farm to store unrefined fuel, so it was still class E -- you 
still had to melt your own snow and ice, which Mithril has plenty of.

Michael Bailey\'s E port is exactly right, and has more atmosphere than
Mithril\'s ever got.  :) 

>old BB serves as the local E port, an astroid whatever.. 

Heck, does the refining plant still work, and do the tanks still hold
fuel?  Better still, can the repair shops be brought back on-line with
portable fusion generators?  You could get this thing up to D+ class,
no sweat!  :)  Of course, if it\'s a complete hulk....

To get to C status, you need to have regular commercial shuttle service 
to orbit and a repair facility capable of dealing with serious problems.  
The nicer C-class ports will have an orbital terminal, which might
be dwarfed by the transports it serves or might be fairly decent. 
This doesn\'t mean that some primitive worlds might not have big D-class
ports that even have refined fuel -- or kerosene, if you want it. :)

Throwing together even a D-class temporary port wouldn\'t be too hard.
Some portable repair shops of appropriate types (machine, electronic,
gravitic, etc.) and a parts shed, a few prefab buildings, some water 
tankage or a maybe a big storage pool, a place to park ships, and
the usual E-class beacon-and-bedrock and you\'re set.  A portable 
detector set and a tower might be nice too, and a weather satellite,
but even a good E-class port might have these.  Getting to C-class from
there would take more work, or even getting this far on a hostile world.

Tirem is just one of the larger asteroids in the Incalescens Belt: there 
are another 247 "asteroids" with a size between 1 and 8, orbiting as a 
belt around the primary, Kinkos.  According to the most common theory, 
the Belt is the result of the destruction of a small (size 22?) planet 
 - perhaps during the Final War - with the resulting fragments forming a 
mass of small planets in orbit around Kinkos. Navigation within the 
boundaries of the Belt is satisfactory throughout the Belt: however, gas 
traces of nitrogen and methane is thinly spread throughout the Belt, and 
may cause limited communication problems.

ON TIREM

Tirem is an elongated, misshapen brick of a world, with it\'s diameter 
varying from 3000 km to 22,000 km.  Long riddled with tunnels, it remains 
one of the greatest sources of nickel in the Regency: a few other items 
are here also, largely copper and iron.  The convoluted shape of the 
world - along with relentless "hollowing" by kilometer-wide mobile 
excavation complexes - contribute to the variable gravity on Tirem.

The 21.48 billion people who reside here include a large number of 
ex-Trini and "assimilated", dispossessed Aslans who couldn\'t afford to 
leave the Regency.  These immigrants, fleeing their homes with only the 
clothes on their back, have begun to reverse the grim atmosphere that 
pervades throughout the system, but even today face entrenched 
discrimination and suspicion by Natives.

HISTORY

Centuries of hard living has shaped both the culture and the lifestyles 
of Tirem.  Always overshadowed by Glisten, Tirem is where the hard-luck 
miners who can\'t afford Glisten anymore eventually migrate to.  Despite 
Tirem\'s evident natural wealth, the good times never seemed to stick 
around, and the only thing that was built for future generations was bad 
debts and old hatreds.  

The Tirema have an extremely strong family system, which long made the real 
dicisions on what happened here.  The Families divided up Tirem - and the 
rest of the system - to over 32,200 tiny, seperate, fiercely independent 
nations.  During good times - say, between 350 and 475, or from 1000 to 
1116 - this system provided a support system for all Tirema, providing an 
outlet for pride and mutual help.  When times were bad, the situation 
deteriorated to a war of All againast All, with truly ugly consequences 
(between 580 and 610, about 1/4 of the entire population died via warfare 
and its consequences).

Unfortunately, these cycles tended to coincide with the wealth of Tirem.  
When desperately poor, violence was pratically nonexistant, with
everyone desperately engaged in simply keeping the heaters operating and 
the air purifiers working for one more day.  As wealth grew, so did envy, 
eventually resulting in a cataclysmic civil war between every Family and 
every other Family - and impoverishing all in a very short period of time.

Tirem was still recovering from it\'s last nadir (at 1085) when the 
Rebellion swept over it in the late 1110\'s.  After the fall of Glisten, 
the Domain began to mass it\'s forces at Crout, just a parsec away.  The 
Aslan ihatel warships desired Tirem as a staging area to further press 
back the Regency, and fought a host of shirmishing actions and sharp, 
short battles here.  Crout faced a full scale assault three times - in 
1119, 1123 and 1125 - and each time the fighting spilled over to Tirem, 
ruining much of it\'s industrial base.  Ownership of Tirem itself changed 
hands 11 times (three times in 1120 alone) with the usual exorborant level 
of damage and tragedy as the price for being a battlefield.

When the Domain returned to stay in 1130, Tirem was in ruins, without a 
government and it\'s peoples largely in despair, helpless to prevent the 
destruction.  The Domain\'s arrival initally just worsened things, as 
billions of poor Aslan immigrants, fleeing Glisten and other occupied 
worlds, but unable to afford the pumped-up fares needed to return home, 
were just dumped on Tirem by the Domain.  Eventually, aid and repair 
funds arrived, and a government was installed by the newborn Regency, 
but not before several riots and urban battles were fought.  By the 
time another massive wave of immigrants arrived - over 4 billion from Trin, at 
1139 - the Regency was able to quickly provide housing and food, while 
stifling the local hotheads easily (via both political and militarily means).

By 1200, Tirem has rebuilt itself well, becoming definitely more richer and 
more stable than before the Rebellion.  The provisional All-Tiren 
government has become pernament, and, wonders of wonders, is even 
respected by the citizens.  Several new ports have been built, with the 
main port at CorkRock upgraded to "B" level.  Traditional freedoms are 
maintained, but the Tirema are no longer willing to permit the Families to 
destroy their hard-won semiprosperity for the sake of pretty promises.

MINING

The major mining concerns of Tirem revolve around bulk nickel mining and 
refining.  Massive 300,000 to 1,000,000 ton motherships slowly devour the 
smaller asteroids, with the miners looking like so many hyperactive ants 
as they devour the asteroid.  When that asteroid is finally emptied of 
valuable metals, the ship slowly coasts off to new pastures. 

The motherships slowly tow their cargo to the starport on CorkRock, and 
as they do so, the interior of the ship is consummed with the task of 
refining the nickel ore into useful bulk blocks.  After a journey that can 
take several months, the mothership arrives at CorkRock, where enormous 
Regency bulk carriers load on the blocks, to be taken to industrial and 
high-pop systems throughout the rimward Marches.

Almost all of these motherships are themselves hollowed-out asteroids, 
which rely on dangerous fusion rockets for transportation for themselves 
and their cargo (which can outmass the ship 20:1!) The folk on there are 
among the poorest folk of the Regency above TL 10, living short, dangerous 
lives: very few has ever known of any place other than their ship\'s, 
CorkRock (which is viewed as a temporary haven), and the Outer Rocks.  
The wealth of Glisten is only a week away via jumpspace, but as distant 
as Capital in it\'s effect on the lives of the people here.

CULTURE

Celtic influences are easily found in Native Tirema culture, but are most 
obvious in the language, songs and storytelling.  Most folk speak a form 
of Anglic and Aslan-influenced T\'nair, which has endured from the 
original settlements of Tirem. Names like Rosann (Rose), Siun Ni Dhuibhir
(Susan O\'Dwyer), and others are especially popular for girls, even among 
the Aslan (how many Aslan femals named Susan can be found outside of Tirem?)

The Aslan\'s have also influenced the locals - although the locals will 
vigourously deny this.  Aslan concepts of honour and tradition have begun 
to seep into local thought, and is rapidly intergrating itself into the 
fabric of society.  This has led to a lessening (!) of violence, and a 
greater rigidity in gender roles.

Dress for men tend\'s to be simple, sensible and close to the skin.  A 
skin-tight suit with \'pockets\' that run down the legs is common apparel 
among the Tirema.  Women\'s fashion largely follows standard Regency 
mores, but with rather more modesty and with certain, aslan-influences 
touches (say, T\'nair runes along their hems and edging their blouses).
  
Religions tend to be widely varied, and personal, with a general 
preference to the more "philosophical" faiths rather than the "supernatural" 
ones.  Every ship and even the most pitiful "tunnel rat" shacktowns has 
at least one Shrine or Temple, which are lavishly decorated and perfumed.

Several local priesthoods are famed for having having their "bone" skull 
replaced by a "glass" skull.  It\'s rather... disturbing... to see those 
veins just pounding away, but the locals don\'t seem to mind at all: if 
anything, the average local finds it "cute"!

Robots are among the few things absolutely forbidden: the descendents 
of the Trini will tolerate nothing less.  Even cybernetically enhansed 
people will be casted out of the better eating extablishments, and 
brutalized by young thugs if the enhansement is obvious. (And believe 
me, these folk carefully watch strangers for even the slightest sign of 
artifical anything!)

Damn! Beaten to the punch! Oh, well, here it is anyway:


One of the problems that\'s acknowledged to have developed in 
Traveller is the fact that players are often too well informed -- having
access to GM materials (and thus knowledge) that CHARACTERS
would not have. One way around this is to make it a little more clear 
about what sort of things characters would actually know, given 
their circumstances.

To this end, let\'s start something in the RC:

REMNANT\'S GUIDE

The "Remnant\'s Guide" is a series of articles, written by knowlegable
(but not expert) remnants on a wide variety of subjects, especially where
recovered data is spotty. They are intended for a general RC audience, 
and provide a working overview of some aspect antebellum life. 
Specific technical topics are avoided, not so much from censorship as 
from the fact that there are technical journals already devoted to such topics.
Therefore, you won\'t see "A Remnant\'s Guide To: the Instellarms 
PFKXG-15 Mk 246 Battle Dress."

What you will see is "A Remnant\'s Guide To:
Coalition Space (what it was like before)
The Major Races (except the Hivers, since there\'s plenty(?) of
          information on them from other sources
The Ancients (and how do the Droyne fit in?)
The Travellers\' Aid Society "

etc.

Since the "Remnant\'s Guide" series is from remnants\' (i.e. Imperials\')
P.O.V., the information should also be useful to folks playing in 
the Regency (heirs to the Impys) or in a setting sometime pre-Collapse
(i.e., 5th Fronteir War, Rebellion-era, etc.).

Calling "dibs" on the "Ancients" guide,

"Calling the Imperium \'sick\' and \'fatally diseased\' is a lie of convenience.
 In 1116, he was given a choice, and chose the path that meant war.
 In 1123, he was one of the few beings in a position to have even a
 chance of taking out one of the engines driving the war on and on.
 Under such circumstances, those of conviction might feel compelled
 to take action, to do something to actually SAVE lives by ending the
 chaos. But if one feels the whole system is \'sick\', it\'s easier to
 rationalize cowardice. So instead, he fled and gained a reputation for 
 \'wisdom\' by spouting nice but effectively useless platitudes.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If these events had happened in isolation I might be inclined to agree
with you but with everything else that\'s happened plus the rest of what
you yourself posted I think it\'s too much of a coincidence that 2 of the
key members of GDW have left the comp. for financial reasons relatively
close together (esp. considering the long tenure they\'ve both had).
===================================================================

However what is worrying is that certain members on this list are having 
trouble with their subscriptions to GDW. Not Good. GDW\'s profile on this 
side of the Atlantic has been a little quiet since the glory days of

I think they\'ve been on thin ice for awhile & now it\'s gotten worse.
====================================================================

All we can do is sit back and wait for some more news... and hope this
isnt going to happen.


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GDW may still have a chance. IMO it\'s a slim one at best. If they do
survive there\'ll, no doubt, be some more changes coming. The worst
aspect is one that you didn\'t mention & that is that GDW could not
even fill an order for a single copy of TNE, as reported by another
member of this list. That is very, very grave. This all gives me a
strong feeling of deja\'vu. It takes me back to early \'82 & the demise
of SPI.

I do hope you meant size 2.  Size 22 is hardly what I\'d call small!

21.48 BILLION permanent residents on a planetoid like this?  I have to
  say that if you rolled this up fairly, this is one of the places that
  the aged and decript World Generation system breaks.

Heck, that many people and their life-support equipment would mass almost
  as much as the bloody "world".  Then again, this is my gut reaction.
  One of you number-crunchers want to try and justify this figure?

(Then again, a glance at the UWP seems to show a relatively normal world...
  which Tirem is definitely NOT, as described.  I\'d like to know how a
  size 7 sphere became a 3x22 (?) ribbon, in the designer\'s mind.)

It\'s worth the effort.  I enlarged the Spinward Marches map
from Megatraveller so that the subsectors are the same size
as in Supplement 3, and it\'s a very useful playing and
campaign designing aid.  It\'s also easier to read (black on
white) than the sector map that came with Megatraveller (or
the Domain of Deneb map that came with one of the
Megatraveller Journal issues).

3- and 4-parsec gaps are only a problem for jump-2 ships if they jump from
an uncivilized star system. Otherwise you simply rent a drop tank from the
local drop tank dealership and jump to a spot between the two systems,
arriving with your tanks full and ready to proceed with the second jump
to your destination. If that isn\'t possible the merchant can install
collapsible fuel tanks in his hold. This will cut into his cargo space,
but if the alternative is an 8-jump detour, there\'s still a hefty profit
to be made.

Oh, I agree - probably the most useful play aid I\'ve used is a photocopy
(actually several) of the Solomani Rim map in the centre of Supplement 10.
I used it to show the new border as the War continued around them, the
players used it for planning (escape) routes, etc etc. Can\'t understand
why they haven\'t included them this time - it\'s only another page.

TNE seems to have broken the tradition of including a big sector map -
Deluxe CT had one, MT boxed set had one, even the computeer games had one!

 I think it\'s a great idea, and it\'s not really a question of
 "beaten to the punch."  The Regency Institute for Cultural
 Education is (within the Traveller universe) an organization that
 is disseminating information about a living culture, to the
 members of that culture.  What the Remnant\'s List (I\'m uneasy
 about that title, but can\'t think of a better one) does, is
 provide information about a dead culture to members of a living
 descendant culture.  That\'s two different missions, although there
 is some conceptual overlap.  The nearest equivalent in Regency
 space would be if there was an organization that focussed on
 cultural information pertaining to the Ziru Sirka (the first one,
 not the Breakup-era Ziru Sirkaa) or to the Rule of Man (aka
 Ramshackle Empire), and not to the Long Night or Third Imperium.

 Go for it, with my encouragement.

Andrew Madden and myself created full stats for Tavonni\'s class-B
starport, using Striker I rules, way back in 1988. We even armoured
the thing to factor-60 all round (as I recall, factor-90 for the
control tower). Who needs blast berms? Just build your \'port using
bonded-SD.

The whole thing only cost 3,000 MCr. Cheap at half the price.

(Yes there IS a Tavonni RICE Paper - hopefully by next week!)

1.QUERY: MINIMUM LAW LEVELS

Do this premise and conclusion sound reasonable:
Even a law level 0 world must adhere to Imperial law in terms of trade.
Therefore, this means that even law-0 worlds will have customs checks for nukes,
illegal drugs etc.

2.FUEL TANK PLAY AREAS

In my campaign, I have said that the fuel tanks are compartmentalised. That is,
the fuel is stored in multiple tanks which are hooked up to each other. This
idea can also been seen in the deck-plans by Seeker (I don\'t have any, I\'ve just
read the ads). This makes CT fuel loss easier to understand - you lose 10 tons
of fuel per hit, because each compartment holds 10 tons. It also makes sense
when describing things to players:
"Damage control has registered a hit in compartment 3 of the primary starboard
tank".
"OK, I\'ll shut down the valves to that compartment, and re-route fuel flow
around the breach".

3.JUPITER IN RATS AND CATS

In digest 481, Alvin pointed out an error in Rats and Cats. Note that both
Jupiter AND Saturn are Large GG\'s, as noted originally in _Scouts: Book 6_.
Note also that the UPPs for Venus and Titan are incomplete; both should include
"An" in the "Remarks" column (see text, p5 and 7).

4.ASLAN NEW LORDS AND THE REGENCY

In digest 481, Alvin said:
>"we are both stronger if we\'re united than if we remain
>separated, and the New Era requires a united stand between equals"

Interesting - and probably valid - philosophy. But very Star Trek (Federation
vs Klingons), wouldn\'t you say?

As to incorporating the Aslan systems, here\'s a quote from the RSB:
"For what are the Marches, after all, if not a mini-Imperium?... The Third
Imperium was a macrocosm of the Spinward Marches"

I think that this means that the New Lords will be seen by GDW to be the
equivalent of the Hierate, in small scale, as the view the Regency to be
the Imperium, in small scale. I don\'t think the Aslan will be assimilated
that easily ("Resistance is NOT futile!").

5.EFATE

In digest 481, Alvin posted his latest version of F8. Some points:

a. The Trade column of the UPP should read: Hi In An Rw:Z
b. You may want to put in the 1117 stats AND the 1201 stats (like Michael
Bailey\'s papers). The RICE keepers (Jeff Zeitland et al) may want to make
this part of a new standard.
d. The highest that the Medical TL can be is the Energy TL of 15. Unless a
special case, the Medical TL should be 15, not 16 (_World Builder\'s Handbook_,
p84). The Novelty tech level should be 15, as it (in this case) represents the
highest "achievement" TL (_WBH_, p86). Another option (possibly better, who
knows) is to raise Energy to 16, raise Novelty to 16, and keep Medical as it is.

6.RSB ACQUISITION

James Dempsey, are you based in Canberra? The Games Cupboard in Woden may still
have some copies.

I enlarged the Marches to the same size as in the 5FW boxed set, and
can now play the 5FW across the entire Marches!

I also know that many people (myself included) copied the entire
_Atlas of the Imperium_ and stuck it together. I also added the
Xboat routes (from the _Traveller\'s Digest_) and now have an almost-complete
net across Known Space.

INTRODUCTION

Welcome to Tavonni - Centre of the Marches!

We hope you enjoy your stay in this unique and fascinating world. We hope that
this booklet serves as a guide, to help you become acquainted with Tavonni.

PLANETARY HIGHLIGHTS

Tavonni Safari Park (TASP): this island has been set aside for the exclusive use
of safaris. These include both camera shoots and big-game hunting expeditions.
Much of the more exotic of Tavonni\'s wildlife can be seen inhabiting the island.

Tavonni Scout Base: A recent construction, this fully fledged base is open for
inspection once a month. Visitors are able to tour the landing pads, workshops,
barracks, and other areas that make up a modern Scout facility.

FACILITIES

Tavonni boasts many facilities for the discerning traveller.

BEOWULF STARPORT

At TL 15, Tavonni\'s starport offers the best facilities a high-tech world can
offer. With space for 40,000 tons of starships, modern replenishment facilities,
refined fuel, linkage to the world-wide computer net, easy passenger and cargo
access, Beowulf Starport is the best B-class starport within 10 parsecs.

HOTELS

Hotel-At-the-Edge-of-the-World: this complex was constructed in line with the
low-key nature of development on Tavonni, blending into the natural surroundings
at the edge of The Plateau. The hotel overlaps the edge of the plateau, giving
its patrons a commanding view over the jungle, located two kilometres below.

Starport Hotel: This is the oldest hotel on Tavonni, and is immediately adjacent
to the starport, within the extrality line. This hotel caters specially for
commercial travellers, as it has hookups into the world-wide net, and is closely
tied to the starport. A large arrival/departure board in the lobby, plus
extensive alcoves hooked into the trade and commerce network, emphasise the
hotel\'s concern with travel and trade.

TASP Beach Resort: As the only commercial construction allowed on the Tavonni
Safari Park, the Resort offers luxurious accommodation right on the waterfront.
Created to resemble a primitive village, the resort\'s buildings house
state-of-the-art entertainment facilities, able to satisfy the most jaded
traveller.

T.A.S. Hostel: A must-see for T.A.S. members, the Tavonni Hostel is one of the
most advanced and luxurious of its type in the Spinward Marches.

TRANSPORTATION

Beowulf Airport: The major airport on Tavonni is located next to Beowulf Down.
Commercial grav-liners can whisk passengers to the other side of the planet in a
matter of hours. Additionally, those who wish to fly aircraft are also available
to use this facility to fly their own aircraft or rented ones. Rental aircraft
cater for all types of enthusiast, from old-fashioned biplanes to jet fighters.

Flitters: Grav flitters are available for hire at Tamoachan City. They range
from light transport for local touring, right up to speeder-class vehicles for
high-speed transport.

Monorail: All major centres on The Plateau are connected by a monorail link.
Fast, economical and quiet, the monorail is the major people-mover on Tavonni.
Passengers arriving by air or from space can be quickly whisked away to their
destinations.

COMMERCIAL FACILITIES

Warehousing: Available for rent, Tavonni\'s commercial warehouses contain
advanced environmental equipment capable of reproducing virtually any
environment required for cargo storage.

Lone Scout Enterprises: This company runs the spaceship construction and
starship repair yards adjacent to Beowulf Down. The facility can repair or
replace virtually any damaged starship components. The yards also build
spaceships, specialising in small craft. They have rapidly become known as
leaders in this area of ship construction.

Well, there it is. If you feel it has been written by a tourist operator eager
to intice and impress potential travellers, then I\'ve written it correctly.

Note that it is not complete. For example, I have not mentioned the Tavonni
Convention Centre, "designed with the executive board member in mind. Here,
a company\'s officials from across the subsector can meet face-to-face, after
having been transported to Tavonni via luxury liner..."

Actually, this is from the RSB! (Don\'t you just love places like this!)

You could justify this by saying that this is for the entire belt, but it
probably won\'t wash: if it as, the UWP would be for a belt ( "000" )

Funny, funny...

Tirem is supposed to be a single, very bid asteroid in a asteroid belt.
It\'s the sole pernamently occupied place in the Belt, so the UWP is for a
world, not the Belt as a whole.

Sure.  It\'ll be done by the starport authority, and the planetary
government won\'t even get into it.  Typically, Traveller starports
are extraterritorial, and are not part of the local planetary
government.  That doesn\'t mean that many planetary governments
won\'t have a *second*, possibly far stricter checkpoint, at the
starport gates.

Luna has an active "environmentalist" movement that wants to limit human
impact on Luna as much as possible, and clean up old eyesores like the
strip-mining scars on Mare Imbrium from the Long Night era, according to
Marc Miller\'s Dragon article.  DGP mentioned that Venus is believed to
be an Ancient site, and it\'s a hard terraforming job anyway.  They also
say that Mars *is* being terraformed, and has been for seven centuries.
This may seem like a late start, but it may be that the effort was begun
and abandoned previously.  Besides, traditionally, terraforming efforts
in Traveller are rare, expensive, and incomplete.

No, this isn\'t fully thought out.  Imperial trade law
applies in space, not on worlds.  If a _world\'s_ law
prohibits drugs, etc., then _its_ customs station, at the
gate between the starport and the world, will search for
them.

Imperial law avoids prohibiting the transportation or
possession of anything -- it\'s just too much of an
enforcement nightmare.  Imperial trade law is mainly
concerned with setting transportation standards, primarily
for safety ("those californium shells need to be packed in
10cm of lead shielding before you can be cleared for
landing at downport").

On the other hand, where Imperial security is an issue,
Imperial law does authorize Imperial forces to inspect
spaceships (both jump-capable and not).  The Imperium also
typcially deputizes local forces to carry out these
inspections.  Again, however, these are more likely to be
in space when a ship first jumps into the Imperium from
outside, rather than at the starport.

   With a UPP of F43056A-F, I assume Mars has been terraformed to build up
the atmosphere.  It\'s present day atmosphere stat should be either 1 or A,
depending on just how thin that CO2 atmosphere is.

        Why not just continue as we are now? Some people _like_ the RC. Some
people _like_ the Regency. Some people _like_ the Rebellion. Some people
_like_ the Unshattered Imperium. And some people _like_ their own
home-rolled campaign. Everybody just continues developing the parts they
like, and people can pick and choose the best ideas from each.

I wonder if it is possible to do different things? A multiverse perhaps?

I think that one of the strengths of T$R (in comparision) is that it created
different worlds to put settings on. When you are tired of the Monty-Haul
comedy relief (Greyhawk), you can venture into the Realms. If you want "Dark
AD&D", run a Planescape or Dark Sun campaign. If you want mega-battles, try
Battlesystem; for smaller fights, use the Skirmish rules.

Now, I realise that many Traveller players create their own universes. However,
by limiting their "story" to one basic history, I think that GDW failed to win
market share. What happens when people get sick of the standard history? Can
they jump into something else for a while, and return to the old campaign later?
I know people *talked* about historical adventures, for example (eg. J. Andrew
Keith\'s "Exploration", JTAS 18) - but no official scenarios were published.

Furthermore, if there IS only one overall history, where do the players come in?
If the entire area will be collapsed by Virus, why struggle through the
Trasilon and Vilani Exodus scenarios (Challenge 67-69, and 69-70, respectively)?
It is like watching Aliens again after seeing Aliens 3. You just sit there, like
a friend of mine does, saying "Don\'t bother. You may as well stop fighting -
you\'re all going to die" (he says this to annoy us, but you get the idea!).

Can the system support multiple "histories" - or is the one, solid history the
backbone of Traveller, without which it will perish?

b.Modules

Another thing that T$R does reasonably well is to publish immediately-playable
modules. These come with slick packaging in pretty colours, and actually make
you want to buy the product (although admittedly, most of the recent ones have
been "play through the recent novel" - yawn).

GDW has livened up its act with the RC trilogy - these almost make me want to
play a RC campaign for its own sake (almost - I\'m still a native of the
Marches!). We should be saying, "More! More!"

Are more modules a possibility, or are we limited to magazine scenarios?

I made a remark about

Let me develop the "enforcement nightmare" issue a little.

The social contract between the Imperium and its member
states involves requirements and freedoms.

The Imperium is required to provide interstellar security,
including protection from external threats (like invasion),
protection from certain internal interstellar threats (like
piracy), and protection of people and property in
interstellar space (like from unsafe starships).

The member states are required to pay taxes, submit their
young adults to the draft, allow the Imperium to establish
a zone of extrality with a starport within the state, and
otherwise join in the defense of the realm.

The member states are otherwise free from Imperial rule.
The Imperium is otherwise free to disregard the desires or
interests of the member states.

In this paradigm, the Imperium basically doesn\'t get into
the business of regulating what is made or possessed on
member states.  The only exception is for items that affect
Imperial security.  The best known examples of the
exception are (1) Ancient artifacts, which are all --
discovered and undiscovered -- Imperial property and (2)
nuclear weapons other than those used for Imperial
defense.

As to (2), the Imperial Rules of War prohibit the
possession or use of nuclear weapons in intra-Imperial
conflicts.  Many member states, however, are charged with
Imperial defense and in that capacity allowed or even
required to possess and be able to use nuclear weapons.

For example, a member state that fields SDBs against
pirates or invaders properly arms the SDBs with nuclear
missiles. Similarly, colonial fleet and army units are
armed them with nuclear weapons.  Mercenary units hired by
the Imperium or hired by member states to accomplish tasks
ordered by the Imperium are often allowed or required to
be armed with nuclear weapons.

So, to return to the original question, yes, "a law level
0 world must adhere to Imperial law in terms of trade." The
most important result of this conclusion is that any
starships manufactured on the world must conform to
Imperial Minstry of Transportation standards, notably for
identity/communications (transponder and communications
protocols) and safety (HEKs, lifeboats, pressure sensors
for iris valves, etc.).

In addition, the Imperium may allow, require, or prohibit
the world\'s defense forces from possessing nuclear weapons.
If the Imperium prohibits nuclear weapons, _Imperial_
officials will take steps to prevent, or at least report,
their importation or manufacture.  Depending on the threat
level perceived by the Imperium, such measures may be
extremely invasive or quite minimal -- usually the latter.
(That\'s how Zid Rachele and his gang got nukes into the
Scout base on Saki/Deneb.)

If the nuclear weapons are not going to the defense
forces, the Imperium will be interested as soon as it
finds out, whether such possession violates local law or
not.  The Imperium won\'t require the world to enforce the
Imperial Rule of War against unauthorized nuclear weapons
-- it will just send the Marines.

I think when TNE was orignally written, that was the idea. I think GDW
wanted to write other Sci-Fi settings, based on whatever successes they
had with the TNE setting. Unfortunately the flow of sourcebooks/modules
was a little too slow, and so TNE wasnt the big success it should have been.

Also you have to remember that TSR is a BIG company compared to GDW, and
have interests
other than straight RPG\'s, ie publishing, and at one point, computer
games. So they have a lot of money to spend developing these alternate
settings.

The last TNE product I bought was "Vampire Fleets". While it wasnt the
greatest book Ive bought of GDW (Come back the Keith Bros. All is

> Are more modules a possibility, or are we limited to magazine scenarios?

I remember having a conversation with Loren Wiseman some time last year.
I asked him that same question; more modules. His reply was (I think!?!)
that for GDW, sourcebooks make more money per unit sold than modules.

While Im here, what ever happened to GDW\'s E-mail address? Why dont we
hear from them anymore?

Since RICE papers seem to be quite popular, I was
wondering if anyone has assembled a complete list
of planets/systems that have already been described
in greater-than-UPP detail by GDW/DGP.

It wouldn\'t be an actual reproduction of said material,
merely a list of things that have been done in "the canon"
somewhere so people don\'t walk over previous material.

(Everyone is free to ignore canon, of course, but I think this
would still be useful.)

Maybe I\'ll go through my own collection this weekend...
I don\'t have any issues of Challenge, Traveller\'s Journal,
MT Journal, etc, so people who have big article collections
are welcome to email me with a world/article/magazine lists.

That is, if anyone thinks this might be useful...

   Why spend the tremendous resources it takes to terraform worlds
as hostile as Venus or Mars, let alone Luna, when starships permit the
relatively cheap travel of large numbers of colonists to worlds that need
little or no effort to make them habitable for humans?  If you ever wonder
why something isn\'t being done, say `money` or `economics` and you\'re
right 99 times out of 100.

   Note that this kind of landscaping is much cheaper than the effort
required to give Luna a breathable atmosphere, something I\'m not even
sure Luna has the mass to retain in any event.

>DGP mentioned that Venus is believed to be an Ancient site, and it\'s a

   This is correct according to ``Rats and Cats``.  Venus would
probably not worth being terraformed, since the resulting world would
still be too hot to permit large scale habitation.  This makes one wonder
what the Ancients were *really* doing there, since the ``terraforming
project ran amonk`` theory doesn\'t wash from a scientific perspective.

   It\'s possible that an effort was started during the Long Night (when
starship travel was expensive and rather dangerous outside certain
areas), but again, economically speaking it is far cheaper to ship the
colonists to Prometheus than it is to make an Earth-like world out of
Mars.  A better question is why did anyone start terraforming Mars
at all, and the answer could be a political one.  Afterall, it was not
economical to send men to the Moon in 1969, but it gave loads of good
PR to the US, and demonstrated their technological superiority over the
Soviet Union.

Edward Swatschek writes of Mars:

   Mars stats in 1995 AD should be:  X410000-0.  You could argue for
X420000-0 or even X430000-0, but I was always under the impression
that a very thin atmosphere permitted you to breathe with a compressor,
and you would need more than that to breathe on Mars today.

   Why not ask this question: Is Traveller just a collection of three
generations of a science-fiction game, or is it something more than that?

    Look, at this point GDW is still around, and it is conceivable that they
could continue to operate with Loren Wiseman and Frank Chadwick
doing the creative end of things from now until they retire--that could
be 20 years from now or longer--much longer.  Hopefully Loren will
get back on TML here (my understanding is that he has been beyond
busy) and tell us what GDW\'s plans are for the future.

multiverse:

   If we are willing to borrow from other science-fiction sources, there
are a number of ways we could shake things up.

   One way would be to permit wormholes that allow characters to
travel to other parts of the galaxy, even parts of the Universe.  That way
if someone wanted to introduce another alien major race, or human
empires that have nothing what-so-ever to do with the current setting,
they could do so without fear of contradiction.

   Another way would be to set up a number of parallel universes, each
on the same point of the timeline, but with different (sometimes radically
different) storylines.  This would allow players to use the standard TNE
setting, a setting where the Rebellion continues on into 1202, a setting
where the Zhodani win the Frontier Wars, even settings where there
was no Vilani Imperium, or the laws of physics permit sutterwarp or
prevent contragrav.

   Still another would be to permit time travel.  Thus characters could
hop from major setting to major setting, changing history (sometimes with
unintended consequences--I wrote a short story once where a time
traveler helped a German soldier who had been blinded in a gas attack
during WW I--of course the soldier was Hitler), or just adventuring for
adventurings sake.

   We could also of course combine the above, permiting multiple
universes at various stages on the timeline.  Of course coordinating
development would be a nightmare, but then so were the MegaTraveller
starship design rules and we muddled through them (OK, it was a *joke*,
sheesh....).  What price would we pay?  I don\'t know that there is a price
to be paid.  Some of our time perhaps?

>GDW has livened up its act with the RC trilogy - these almost make me

   GDW continues to turn out excellent product, and there\'s something
for everyone who plays Traveller in every product they produce.
If you are not buying TNE products because you are still pissed about
the Imperium dying, you are missing out on some first rate gaming
material.

>Are more modules a possibility, or are we limited to magazine

   Modules take a lot more time and energy to develop than magazine
scenarios.  I speak from personal experience.  With magazine scenarios
most of the basic premises have been thought out in advance for you,
giving you a nice base to work from.  In developing a module, you have
to start almost literally from scratch, developing explanations (in the
form of background) for data you probably developed yourself.  It is a
very time consuming process, the final step of which is to tie everything
together and make sure you haven\'t contradicted yourself at some point
(making sure that the biography of leader `X` fits with the storyline for
planet `Y`, etc.).  Ultimately I think it\'s worth the effort, but it isn\'t for
everyone.

I have never liked the idea of using drop tanks on starships.  They just
aren\'t economically feasible.  (OK, that *certainly* wouldn\'t stop the
military -- I know this for a fact -- but it would give a merchant pause.)
Your starship can have its atmospheric streamlining degraded, its jump drives
don\'t stretch as far (a J-1 free trader w/ drop tanks isn\'t going
*anywhere*), and if you do drop them, that\'s money down the fresher drain!

In my RC campaign, many J-1 free traders and fat traders have internal
dismountable tanks giving them the fuel capacity for an extra one-parsec
jump (since so many stars are two parsecs or more apart).  Sure, they
still take an extra week, but at least they can make it!

The ultimate form of additional fuel tankage is the collapsable fuel
bladder.  Because of the wear-and-tear this type of tankage would be
expected to endure, I can\'t see any of the ships in the Wilds with this
kind of tank.  But for merchants in the RC wanting to stretch their legs,
this is the way to go.

I was looking at the issue from the Imperial standpoint, I guess. I *never*
assumed that the planetary authority would be involved, just the Imperial
authorities. I asked the question based on the assumption that "Imperial Law" is
sort-of law level 1. Things like murder, possession of nukes by private
individuals or companies, possession of psi drugs (pre-Regency) and K\'kree
highleaf, etc would be illegal in imperial space.

This is in addition to the convention (the unwritten "rules of war") that say
that severe disruption of trade is a no-no, and will be jumped upon.

Note that it is not really law level 1: the Imperium will not stop you from
possessing or transporting energy weapon, poision gas, grenades, etc. Perhaps
an expanded law profile is required for space?
eg. base = 0, trade = 0, personal = 1, mil wpns = 0 (rats, I\'ve forgotten what
they all mean - I\'ll have to look the profile up tonight).

Sorry, but there\'s only one sandcaster, and 3 MFD\'s (TL H, 10 hex,
laser/missile, 1.18 Mw each)

 Crew breakdown:

Maneuver = 2  Flight Crew = 2   Command = 3      Psg = 18
Gunner = 7    Elect =1          Stewards = 3        - 14 Diplomats
Engineer = 4  Ship\'s Troops = 4 Medical = 1         - 5 staffers
                                                    - 1 valet for senior dip.
                                                    - 8 elite troops

Note: the Electrical crewman is strictly unnecessary, but still nice to have:
      Inteligence operations is important in cutting-edge diplomacy.

Total gunnery crew = 183.

Weapons on the Ugvarran includes:

   1000Mj Meson * 10
   150 Mj Laser T * 150
   Sandcasters * 100
   Missile Barbettes * 50
also:
   PV 671 Meson Screen ("gunnery" crew = 23)

Subtracting the Meson requirement room the Gunnery crew leaves 160
crewmembers, just enough to man the 160 MFD\'s (50 missile only, 110
missile/beam).  All these weapons have workstations (one each) and can be
manned if the MFD\'s go down.

Note that the number of weapons + sandcasters clearly outnumber the
number of MFD\'s to go around.  Often, the missiles, sandcasters and 50 of
the lasers are manned by ship\'s troops: the 10 meson guns are also
manned, in case the MFD\'s gop down.

Note also that the "Ship\'s Troop\'s" are NOT included in the calculation
of the number of commanders, but are treated as passengers.  Largely
because the troops have there own command structure, of course.

Whoops! need to include basic life support here... hopefully, there will
be a revision by next week.  It\'s unlikely to change the figures much,
though...

Not in the sense that I\'ve made a detailed economic analysis of it, no. So
maybe I\'m wrong. But the mechanics would be quite simple: The owner of the
drop tanks would have a shuttle designed to collect the drop tanks after
use. The amount of actual maneuvering would be extremely low; the merchant
flies to a spot just outside the jump limit where the drop tanks floats
in orbit; they attach the tanks; they drop them again in practically the
same spot; the tanks are collected and refueled. The feasibility would
depend on the number of merchants who want to use the tanks. If the traffic
can bear the cost of establishing a fuel depot in deep space and pay for a
jump-capable fuel shuttle to keep it topped off, then it can certainly
support a near-space fuel depot with a non-jump fuel shuttle and a small
shuttle plus a selection of drop tanks.

Seeing all the posts on making J-1 ships go that little extra parsec got me
a little woried about a rule I use in my game.

I figured the fuel tanks on a starship were one large unit, comprising of
both the reaction mass and the J-drive fuel.  Once a J-1 ship makes a Jump
to a point in deep space 1pc away from its destination(assuming a J-2 is
needed), that ship can shunt fuel from the fuel tanks into the J-drive for
another jump.

Yes, using the manuever reaction mass is risky, you might not have enough
fuel to stop and get into a parking orbit when you get to the Mainworld.  I
usualy recommend to the PC\'s that they should only do it for ONE extra jump.
But you know how PC\'s are.

But my Question to the TML is this.  Have I misread the rules?  Are Jump
fuel and Maneuver fuel separate? Or is the rule above OK?

My players and I have had this debate before, but I would like to know what
the current concensus is on this.

As usual, I remembered this after posting the message. I haven\'t seen the

separately), but isn\'t it the same as the one in Astrogators Guide to
Diaspora? If so, the data is out of date, and it doesn\'t include tho whole

is pretty useless.

Nonononono!
The big advantage of games like Traveller (and RuneQuest) is the background
- rather than having basic sourcebooks on a selection of backgrounds, they
concentrate on a single, extremely detailed background. I, and many other
people on this list, probably know as much about Traveller history as
about *real* history, and that makes refereeing and playing much easier.
It also makes this list work - If someone mentions the Rape of Trin, for
example, we all know what he\'s talking about, which wouldn\'t be true if we
were all playing in different universes.

On top of everything else, GDW simply don\'t have the manpower (even before

"M.A. Trickett" <mat3@leicester.ac.uk> asks why the canon Traveller
  universe has little or no mention of technologies like nanotech,
  biotech, cybernetics, etc etc.  (A related issue, often brought up
  here, is why Traveller computers lag behind even present ones.)

The answer to this is fairly simple:  Classic Traveller, aka the
  little black books, is a product of the late 1970s and early 80s.
  At that time, concepts such as nanotech, cyberpunk, etc had not
  yet appeared in SF and personal computers were just starting to
  enter the home; the exponential growth in computing power (doubling
  every year and a half, or so I\'m told) had not yet become apparent.

Since then, attempts have been made to retrofit more recent tech into
  Traveller, but in relatively superficial ways (since the background,
  which can\'t be radically changed, doesn\'t include them in its
  assumptions).

This is a good example of the difficulties in seeing even 20 years
  into the future, let alone 3,700 (give or take a Long Night or
  two)... Speaking of which, we all remember T:2000, right?  *grin*

I have always believed that drop tanks are only feasible on well-travelled
routes. A breed of people exist who make their money on hanging aroung jump
points in spaceships, salvaging the drop tanks cast off from ships. This idea
is not mine, it actually comes from Isaac Asimov in _The Martian Way_. In his
novel, the Martians were actually salvaging fusion drive fuel tanks, but the
principle remains the same. These folk are looked down on by most traders,
being seen as scavengers (almost pirates). They grab the empty tanks and ship
them back to the system\'s refuelling depot. The depot refuels the tanks and
charges the next merchant in line for the privilege.

BTW, the novel uses fuelled reaction drives, and a lot is made of the delta-v
required to catch a wayward tank that some snotty starship captain has
deliberately shot off at a tangent. This should fit very well with TNE\'s use
of fuel.

I don\'t think that this is a reasonable assumption.  Law
level is a measure of (1) the likelihood of governmental
intrusion into a traveller\'s affairs and (2) the
government\'s level of corruption.  The law level is then
attached to a statement about local laws on carrying
weapons.  A single number for these concepts grossly
oversimplifies even a single world\'s government, let alone
that of the Imperium.  Law level is simply not a useful
analytical tool for interactions with enormous,
heterogenous entities like the Imperium, the Aslan
Hierate, or the Vargr Extents.  (I am dubious of its virtue
when dealing with the Zhodani, Hivers, or K\'kree, for that
matter, for the same reason.)

When considering the likelihood of intrusion by the
Imperial government into the affairs of travellers, and the
Imperium\'s level of corruption in that context, I look
primarily to the identity of the person administering
Imperial law.  More often than not, it is an official of
the world\'s government, empowered to enforce Imperial law
(e.g., a starport authority officer).  In that case, I
look to the local law level for guidance.  The rare
encounters with an actual Imperial official (usually an
officer of a uniformed service) I usually generate in
advance.

Your question

> Note that it is not really law level 1....Perhaps an
> expanded law profile is required for space?

really goes to "what do the criminal law provisions of the
Imperial Legal Code proscribe?"  I think that they only
proscribe the following:  Acts malum in se; acts that
threaten Imperial security; violations of Imperial
regulations.  None of these prohibit possessions of weapons
or drugs.

Acts malum in se are crimes that are easily identified as
such by the majority of humans living in the Imperium:
Murder, rape, battery, etc.  The Imperial Legal Code
proscribes these crimes to cover locations where they may
occur but be beyond the reach of a local law prohibiting
them.  (E.g., on a world without a population.)
Possession of drugs and weapons is not an act malum in se.

Acts that threaten Imperial security are for the most part
enumerated, but I am sure that there is a provision
prohibiting "any other act that tends to destroy the peace
and security of the realm."  Importing Six Eyes Nest
warbots is the one enumerated crime of which I am aware,
but I assume that at least the following are also Imperial
high justice crimes: interstellar financial fraud,
interstellar slave trading, interstellar environmental
crimes (like breaching quarantine), and interstellar war
crimes.  Possession of drugs and weapons doesn\'t rise to
the level of threatening Imperial security unless the
weapons are nuclear or otherwise capable of mass
destruction, not just of life, but of productive real
estate.

The big advantage of making these Imperial crimes, rather
than merely leaving them to the member worlds, is the
availability of Imperial punishment.  For a noble,
Imperial punishment includes divestiture of title (for
several generations, or permanently).  For a corporation,
its Limited Imperial Charter can be suspended or revoked,
as can that of its controlling parents (and their parents,
as far as the prosecutor can prove control). Ordinary
people convicted of Imperial crimes just get jail time (as
do nobles or corporate executives found culpable).

Violations of Imperial regulations include unauthorized
entry into Red Zones, failure to meet starship safety and
operating standards, and the like.  Imperial regulations
don\'t address possession of weapons or drugs, but do
regulate how weapons, at least, must be carried aboard
starships in Imperial space.

This is exactly correct.  I have been waiting for the 2300AD rewrite to come
out using the new house rules.  Supposedly, there should be very little
conversion.  GDW also wants to release Armor 21 the rewrite of T2K2.2.  One
can use the TNE rules to play almost any game system.  They include rules
for stutterwarp for example.  Now is it easy to play a 2300AD game with TNE
rules, I don\'t think so.  The GM has to do a lot of work to carry out the
conversion.  I know I am doing it now.  I do like the TNE rules (with the
exception of combat), so I push forward.

    'body' => 'I am coming into this discussion late, but I will throw in my $0.02.

Deep space refuling is VERY expensive.  If you are trying to link 2 worlds 3
parsecs away, then as a rule of thumb you will need to carry enough fuel to
accomodate another jump 1.

The nubmers for fules usage look like this
Jump 1  10% of total Volume
Jump 2  15% of total Volume
Jump 3  19% of total Volume
Jump 4  25% of total Volume
Jump 5  30% of total Volume
Jump 6  35% of total Volume

So a Ship with Jump 2 would then have to carry 30% of displacement to get
there and back assuming two parsecs each side only 22.5% if jumping 2 then
1, then allot more m^3 to fuel for the other ships to follow.  What you need
is REALLY large ships.  The Imperium could do this with a 500Kton tanker
with Jump 1-3 and about 80% of the ship fuel tankage. (this means of course
that it becomes barely feasible to have Jump 6 tankers as the ship would
only have 10% volume left for tankage jump 6 then 6 (worst case)).

   I think I worked out once that it takes about 20% of a ship minimum to
provide for M Drives, JDrives Life Support Etc (this may have changed a bit
as have the J Fuel requirements).  So in that example the Jump 2 Tanker
could jump out 2 parsecs using 15% of its fuel, then reserving 7.5% for the
next jump 1 it could drop off @ 50% of its m^3 into waiting ships.  For a
500Kton ship this would be 250Ktons of fuel, this would enable about
2500Ktons of Jump 1 (better with longer legged J drives.

Now, lets look at a smaller ship say a 2500 ton ship in the RC cutter class.
If it carried only fuel modules 1000 tons (2X400 and 1X200) plus fuel from
the Manta, it has a total of 15,194m^3 of fuel.  It must use 4368 for one
Jump 2 to the drop off point leaving 10826.  Now after dropping the Fuel
Modules, it has a new displacement of under 1080 allowing Jump 5.  It will
need only 65m^3 to make the next Jump 1 allowing it to drop off about
10000m^3 of Jump Fuel.  This would allow for about 9500tons of Jump 2 ships
(47 Far Traders) to refuel and make it to the next stop.


Hey thats not all that bad.  I last ried this under MT CT rules and it got
REALLY expensive back in the old 10% per parsec days.  AS you can see for
this instance it will work OK, however if you are going to try to link 2
worlds 4 parsecs away, you only get 4700 tons of ship through (that is only
23 Far traders BTW).  It has to be seen as an opportunity cost.  AS to how
much to charge, the real cost is not the Fuel, but the operation of the
tanker.  Not to mention that the tanks have to be left behind or you cut out
2184m^3 for the jump 1 at full tonnage.  This means that you only get about
7500m^3 left at the drop point or only 35 far traders.  If you do the 2-2
link, then it is going to be 5632m^3 left for only 13 far traders making the
second jump.

Costwide, each drop off will cost 2X 26.16 + 13.1 (2X400 modules 1X 200)
meaning costs of about 65MCr each drop off (assuming no recovery of tanks).
So that the 47 refuels would have to split the cost for 1.38Mcr each.  The
only other cost is the loss of the use of a RC Cutter for the time a 750MCr
ship.  Now it would be possible to design a purpose built tanker, and I
personally think the RC would do it, but they would also have to absorb the
cost.  I mean from the Far Traders point of view, to make that run, takes an
extra week (more if you do maintainance).  You will have to pay the crew for
another week, and only get 1 load of cargo to pay for it.  You will have to
charge more.

Oh well, hope this helps, and does not bore everyone to death.

There was a genetic engineering article in issue 8 of the Traveller

a degree. It seems to have received a number of good reviews...

DROP TANKS

I would assume that \'rented\' ones were typically used only by large corps or
well-established traders (whom the tank-suppliers could trust not to
default). They could use insurance to cover against losses.

On internal tanks, those players who just seem to think it\'s a matter of
putting a large plastic bag in the hold and filling it with liquid hydrogen
get a nasty shock when I tell them the amount of work that _actually_ has to
be done. A single pin-hole leak in the tank could be devastating...

STARPORTS AND THE LAW

David (library@dss.gov.au) said (TML491):
>Perhaps an expanded law profile is required for space?

What you need is the Travellers\' Starport Guide, currently in production by
myself and due for release (given my current timescales) in December 2007.
Ah well... it will eventually contain:
Detailed (manual or random) starport facilities generation, how to map out a
starport, what you find in a starport (from administrators to travellers to
duty-free assistants to cleaners), what you do in a starport (in-system
navigation, landing, take-off, starlane laws, on-ground laws, cargo laws,
technical systems), what you shouldn\'t do in startown (all the nice places
you can find there that you _couldn\'t_ take your granny to visit) along with
plenty of example starports (including maps) and some interesting encounters...

Uggh! What\'s the largest possible "terrestrial" world?
Is there any way a world can be destroyed and leave massive, world-sized
chunks (up to size 8)?

I asked that very question when I interviewed Dave Neilson for RPI (a now
defunct British RPG magazine - most of the team, including me, went on to
write for Valkyrie which is a damn fine magazine and is available in the US
through \'On Military Matters\' in New Jersey (I think) [plug, plug]).

I don\'t have my interview notes to hand (and it was more than two years
ago), but as I recall Dave said that they had trouble fitting everything
they wanted to put into FF&S into the one volume, so to make space they took
out all the things that wouldn\'t be immediately used by player characters,
or that were just too difficult to write up. At that time they were planning
a second volume of FF&S design sequences, which would include things like
Planetoid configurations and all the other things they couldn\'t fit in the
first volume. I wonder if we\'ll see that now.......

 Hm. Will look. I started doing some of the work last night
and a LOT of worlds are detailed with 3 sentence descriptions
all over the place. Small, but just enough to force you to dig them
up if you want to really detail the world and not conflict with
published material (although caring so much about 3 sentences may
be construed as anal, but.)

Well, nobles can lose their title, sure, although most
nobles would no doubt go to great lengths to stop this, even
if they\'re charged with some crime. As for LIC\'s being
suspended, I have my doubts, as no minor noble is going
to want to mess with a corporation that the Emperor holds
stock in and I doubt that the Emperor would suspend the
activities of one of his own investments... The only person
who would have the authority to suspend a LIC without fear
of Imperial reprisals is an Archduke probably, which would be
part of the reasons the Archdukes made into such figureheads
probably.

No doubt it\'s illegal to book a flight plan taking you into
a red zone system, but actually going to a red zone is a
different matter. Drugs probably get the same bizzare treatment
they get today - they\'re illegal to sell, they may be illegal
possess, but they\'re not illegal to consume. Laws in the
Imperium are probably like modern laws - flexible.

Any chance that we\'ll ever have a full Traveller refit regarding these

where Star Wars: A New Hope remains the very cutting edge of what\'s
possible?

(Ooop\'s, make that Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back - can\'t forget

The New Era would be an **Excellent** opportunity to do so.  Except that
the Reformation Colaition seems a bit too primitive for a real TL 12 culture.

 Given that RICE stands for "REGENCY Institute for Cultural
 Education", it would be a bit "off" to write a RICE Paper on a RC
 world.

 I suppose that a similar document _could_ be written for a RC
 world, but evidence indicates that GDW will be developing the RC
 in more detail than we have seen for the Regency to date, or for
 the vast majority of the worlds of Known Space previously.

I\'ve always figured that the tanks are separated, but that the fuel filler
pumps can swap fuel around from tank to tank. (See
_Starship_Operator\'s_Manual_ ) So they could do it off their maneuver fuel,
if they pum maneuver fuel into the jump tankage. If you look at many of the
designs around, most have a little over J1 worth of maneuver fuel, some
more than that. Why?

Well, first off, if you misjump, you can txfr fuel into the jump tankage,
and have 1j1 to make it to a system, which gives yyou an infinitely greater
chance of survival than deep space.

Secondly, in my designs, all tanks are broken down into 1j1 sized tanks,
and the number of them equals at least (MaxJ+1) tanks. this makes the
accounting much easier.

Also, the cannon for firing a Sandcaster as a weapon on the personal scale
is <drumroll, please>, Clasic Traveller AND MegaTraveller. In MT, it\'s in
the Player\'s Manual, under the weapons listings.

    'body' => 'As I understand the rules, using drop tanks works like this:

1) The navigator computes a jump at the ship\'s *current*
displacement value (i.e., a 200-ton J-2 far trader w/ 50-ton drop tanks
now has J-1 capability)

2) After the navigator successfully computes the desired jump, the
engineer activates the jump drive

3) Upon activation, the jump drive begins to consume fuel (to
include fuel from the drop tanks) while charging the hull grid and/or jump
coils (whichever... :-)

4) At the critical energy threshold, the jump field forms about
the ship, and the ship exits our universe for a week

At no time once the jump process has been initiated can the ship safely
discard the drop tanks (without aborting the jump in progress).  Thus, the
ship *must* jump with the drop tanks.  That means anyone trying to rent
drop tanks *must* have at least two outposts (one at point "A", another at
point "B", assuming the merchant is servicing the "A"-to-"B" route).
Furthermore, the tugboats are going to need more maneuver fuel than you
may realize.  Consider that a ship (in BL or BR) must burn a G-turn just
to close with another object IN THE SAME HEX!  (That\'s one G-turn *per
object*!)  Even if the tugboat could maneuver within the hex free of fuel
cost, it still needs to go from one hex to another to retrieve the drop
tanks.  Even if we grant extremely proficient navigators, your customers are
still going to usually arrive at "+/-10%" of the target distance to the target
world.  For the safe 100-diameter distance for a UWP Size 6 world, that
works out to plus-or-minus two hexes in any direction (6 * 1600km diameter *
100 / 30,000km per hex = 16 hexes; 16 / 10 = 1.6, round to 2).  Counting out
from the target hex, that gives us an area of 19 hexes to play in
(1+6+12).  Therefore, I still believe that drop tanks are useful only for
military ships...or para-military ones, at that (corsairs, anyone?).

Removable internal fuel tanks still make sense for merchants in
astrographically sparse regions (such as much of the RC).  However, they
are more economical for J-2 ships (such as far traders and scout/couriers)
than for J-1 ships (free traders and fat traders).  A J-1 ship uses 10% of
the ship\'s colume *per parsec*.  A J-2 vessel uses 15% for a two-parsec
jump, which works out to 7.5% *per parsec*.  A J-3 ship (a subsidized
liner) uses 20% total, or 6.667% *per parsec*.  Etc.  Thus, a far trader
with a 30-ton internal tank can make more efficient use of the extra fuel
than a free trader (the far trader gets an extra 2 parsecs, vs. the free
trader\'s extra 1.5 parsecs).

I am sorry, i know it is kinda off-topic here, but i am in desperate
need of some help or hints for the MT2 Computer Game! For example i
can\'t get into the Universities on Rhylanlor and other planets! I
keep getting the message: " We can\'t go in! It\'s Closed!" The
buildings i try are speciallly marked buildings, are the
universities, but i can\'t get in. Also, i need to know which
artifacts the guy Beckett wants! I brought him Ancient batteries and
other artifacts, but he does not want em! So if anybody has some
files with clues or solutions, i would be very happy if he mailed
them to me!
Thank you very much

Hi all,
About drop tanks - you use them to carry the fuel to the jump
point. Then you burn the fuel to charge your HPG bank. Then you discard
your drop tanks,. that\'s why they\'re called "drop tanks" in the first place.
Finally -and with much lower displacement - you jump.
check out MT if you want "canon"...

Also, you needn\'t worry that some dishonest merchant is going to skip
out on you with rented tanks. since they\'re so big, the ship cannot jump
with them attached. If you still think in terms of jump grids in the hull,
realize that the tank bulges out a few metres and thus would prevent jump.
THe jump tanks would have to contain a lanthanum grid in order to sustain
the larger jump bubble - but then they would be expensive dismountable
exterior tanks.

I think the idea of rentable drop tanks is great - it allows for more
freedom for the merchant ., and he doesn\'t have to jump out into deep
space and trust that there will be fuel for him when he arrives. Ask yourself,
would you empty your tanks on a jump into deep space what with all the
pirates hangin\' around? No, much better to have a full tank of gas when
you arrive - and you can pick your own spot to emerge. that way you\'re
not predictable, and you have the legs to run if you have to.

another point - drop tanks can be used to carry maneuver fuel too.
maybe a good range extender for fighters and ships that often end up
in the bingo fuel situation..

cheers,

I interpret the Jump sequence in a different way to this.  The ship
powerplant runs up and begins dumping energy into the Jump capacitors.
When they have been charged completely, the drop tanks are dropped
(possibly using some sort of timy gas thruster to clear the 1m limit).
Then the capacitors are used to charge the jump grid and we\'re away.
Since at jump time the ship no longer has the tanks the solution is
calculated for the \'clean\' ship.

The point about the tugs is a good one.  I, for one, never considered
the expenses of this before.  It gets a lot better if you assume, as I
do, that all the tanks will be left by departing ships, so they will be
in a fairly close group.  Maybe it still isn\'t economic to collect them
though . . . .

There\'s an idea for an interesting game element in this though. If tugs
are too expensive to operate.  Maybe a more efficient way to do it is
to move a fairly large tug into the general area and have workers in
vacc suits go out and bring the tanks to the tug using hand thrusters.
Boring dangerous work, but it could help to add more atmosphere to
starports in general.

Eric.

: Seven Ideas For Traveller: The New Era

: Presented in no particular order.  Any TNE game I run will almost
: certainly involve at least half of the ideas below.

: I. Drop the UWPs.  Like, immediately.  The Universal World Profile,
: an eight-digit code to describe the basic characteristics of a
: planet, was a useful thing to a vast, impersonal Imperium which
: didn\'t care terribly much about its member worlds, nor about their
: inhabitants.  But the Reformation Coalition is not like that.  If
: anything, it\'s the opposite; it tries to be life-affirming, and to
: recognize the uniqueness and wonder of each person and each world.
: UWPs are a useful tool for gamemasters, but for the Reformation
: Coalition they should be seen as the dangerous, dehumanizing tool
: of the dead, dinosaurian Imperium.

: II.  Along the same lines, drop the sector/subsector designations.
: I don\'t like looking at the map of the RC and seeing it split
: down the middle between Oriflamme subsector and Aubaine subsector.
: It\'s silly.  Those designations were Imperial tools, and there
: are better designations now.

: III.  Change the AO strategy.  Sure, right now the Area of Operations
: strategy is to expand to core-spinward, and Oriflamme has managed to
: con them into limiting it to just seven parsecs, but I think that
: going just seven parsecs core-spinward is foolish in the extreme.  My
: reasoning is simple:  The Reformation Coalition has NO IDEA what
: is going on rimward of them, or trailing, either.  Okay, core-trailing
: are the Hivers, and they\'re theoretically safe, but from straight
: trailing to rim-spinward there could be enormous Vampire Aslan Vargr
: K\'Kree Darrian Star Trigger fleets casually swooping toward
: our little republic.  And the RCES doesn\'t even seem to consider
: that doing a little reconnaissance into Alpha Crucis sector might
: be prudent.  Come ON.  Expand core-spinward, sure, but don\'t limit
: the reconnaissance AO that much.

: IV.  Push to Sol.  Sectorwise, the area immediately around the
: RC looks like this:

: Diaspora|Old Expanses| Hinterworlds
: ----+----+----
: Solomani Rim|Alpha Crucis| Spica

: I gather from old MegaTraveller source material that the
: members of the Solomani Rim Confederation were, before the Great War,
: fairly racist and xenophobic.  Okay, I can believe that.  But the
: RC takes up a small piece of Old Expanses near both Diaspora and
: Solomani Rim sectors; I cannot believe that it has never been
: suggested that sending some ships toward SOL, you remember Sol,
: right?  The one at the bright heart of Solomani Rim Sector, the one
: from which all human life originates, that Sol?  Probably with more
: relic technology and useful information than the RC could process
: in a year, that Sol?  But no, we\'d rather expand into Diaspora.
: I would put forth that, if nothing else, we should see a
: semi-private effort to explore Solomani Rim sector and get to Sol
: before the Guild (or worse) does; it has a lot of symbolic meaning,
: if nothing else.

: V.  Internal Strife.  There is strife in the RC.  There just isn\'t
: enough for my tastes.  More fringe groups, xenophobic, luddite,
: or just with a bone to pick with the current leadership, should
: exist.  In another post I\'ll detail a few of these that I\'ve come
: up with for my own use.  There\'s also little description of conflict
: between, say, business and government.  In fact, things seem awfully
: chaotic in that department, with the RC seeming to be quite willing
: to "nationalize" almost any private assets it wants to.  I don\'t know
: about anyone else, but if I had my starship nationalized and was told
: to go to Diaspora sector for the government, I would be just a little
: incredulous.

: VI.  Lon Maggart Must Die.  Is this guy just Mister Perfect Leader
: or what?  "Challenge" #77 has him addressing a hostile crowd on
: Oriflamme and removing his bulletproof vest in a gesture of solidarity
: and love.  Okay, I\'ll buy that, but wow, does the man have NO flaws?
: He seems to be set up to be the Reformation Coalition\'s George
: Washington, but even Washington did some things he later regretted,
: and occasionally took flak from his political enemies.  He\'s a little
: too perfect for my tastes, and the best solution I can think of
: for this is to have him be assassinated by an Oriflammie.  This could
: give us a really nice JFK figure that future leadership would work
: hard to replace.

: VII.  Expansion Timetable Changes.  The RC expansion timetable (the
: "coreward strategy", which the RC seems to be using, rather than
: the "consolidation strategy") looks like this:
: Phase I: Overt ops in the primary AO with deep covert ops
: in Diaspora sector.  Est. time 2 years, so, from New Era 1 - 3.
: Phase II: Diplomatic blitz to integrate Diaspora sector
: into the RC.  Estimated time 1 year.  NE 3-4.
: Phase III: Extension of main AO to Massilia Sector, continued
: consolidation of Diaspora. Estimated time 2 years.  NE 4-6.
: Phase IV: "Simultaneous Expansion Outward", estimated time
: unknown.  NE 6 onward.

: O-o-okay.  Let me see if I\'ve got this right, looking over
: my handy map.  Let\'s assume that the typical RCES/RCN ship has
: Jump-2 ability, meaning they can get two parsecs in a week; thus,
: a two parsec trip would take two weeks round trip.  There are eighteen
: important targets in the primary AO, which extends as far out as
: seven parsecs from the RC border.  If we assume that each of those
: worlds is four parsecs from the border, on average, we\'re looking
: at two jumps per world; thus each mission to each of the worlds in
: the primary AO takes a month round-trip, six weeks if you include
: time spent on the world.  Twenty-seven ship-months, thus, for one
: mission to each world in the primary AO.  If we assume overlapping
: missions in some cases, and multiple-world missions, we are still
: looking at a big chunk of time.  Consider if you will the amount
: of time it has taken to get the Middle East to come to a peace
: agreement, or the remnants of Yugoslavia.  With a one-month minimum
: time lag on any treaties or agreements, I see a real hard time getting
: eighteen worlds consolidated into the coalition in two years.
: And Phase II?  Getting ALL of Diaspora sector into the RC
: in a YEAR?  At jump-2 you could barely REACH all of Diaspora sector
: in a year, much less get back.  And Diaspora is a hostile environment,
: between xenophobes, TEDs, Vampires, the Guild, and various pocket
: empires.
: I think the timeline should be extended to about a ten year
: plan, personally.  But then again I\'m spending too much time
: sympathizing with the Oriflammen.

: It is therefore with the greatest of distaste that I present
: _The Regency Sourcebook_, which breaks with all of the principles
: that Nilsen went through so much work to describe in that editorial.
: It is published in an atlas format, which is to say that pages 35
: through 75 (!) are devoted solely to showing small maps of subsectors,
: one-line world descriptions for each world therein and longer
: descriptions for important worlds; the book attempts to do justice
: to the 994 worlds that are a part of the Regency in these forty

: Each ethnic group, alien race and local sub-empire in the

: civil war a weapon known as Virus, a computer hardware/software
: virus, was released; it found computer systems, "infected" them,
: sent out more versions of itself, and then crashed the host system.
: This being the 56th century, Virus was a devastating weapon which
: ended up killing (probably) a trillion people.  The only part of
: the Imperium which received advance warning of Virus\'s release was
: an area known as the Spinward Marches, generally thought of as
: something of a backwater because of its isolation from the rest of
: the Imperium.  This isolation, however, turned out to be the Marches\'
: salvation, as a Quarantine Service was set up to prevent Virus-infected
: starships from entering the Spinward Marches.  As it became obvious
: that the Marches were the last remnant of the Empire to survive with
: an interstellar society, Archduke Norris renamed the area the Regency,
: and they keep the flame of Imperium burning.

Is it not possible that the destruction of a gas giant core could have
resulted in the asteroid belt?  While gas giants are mostly gas, as
someone pointed out, there\'s still a lot of solid mass inside them
somewhere (at least that\'s the theory I\'ve heard).  Maybe the collision of
two gas giants?  I\'m not sure how realistic this is, so any astrophysics
types can pound on my head if they like, but I think it would provide
enough mass.  Does anyone have any figures as to the total mass of the
asteroid belt and/or gas giants and/or gas giant cores?

Has anyone tried to re-design some old Star Cruiser 2300AD ships
using the alternative technologies section of FF&S? Unless I\'m doing
it wrong, it appears like FF&S departs significantly from the feel of
the old 2300AD rules.

For example - the old rules based stutterwarp performance on mass
(which makes sense to me - the heavier it is, the harder to jump).
But FF&S now bases the performance on displacement -- so cargo
ships have the same performance no matter how full they are.

The new stutterwarp drives also seem to be quite power hungry. I
tried to re-design the Anjou class frieghter. Unless I totally screwed
up (which is possible) - the new Anjou would require around 180 MW
to achieve the performance that it is supposed to have...unlike the
3 MW that it used to need.

Any FF&S experts (or 2300AD players) out there have any opinions?

On a side note - what tech level would you guys set the 2300AD
universe at? 10? 11? - just curious...

Last I checked the core of Jupiter was thought to be about 10-20 Earth

Hey, I just took a look at CT Book2 and if we call the core 15 Mearth,

Another idea would be to have powered tanks, with just enough Gturns

If you read the main book, it clearly states that you can use J fuel for
reaction mass.  It lists the ship designs with G-Turns then following is
another value if you use J-Fuel.

Tankage can be set up anyway you want it.  Debates abound as to the actual
layout, but since it is all refined Hydrogen (supposedly liquid) you can use
it for Jumping since you can use it for maneuvering.  I would be much more
worred about not being able to maneuver than able to jump.  However if you
reserve at the very least a couple of G-Turns you can make it to a planet
albeit slowly.  You will not be able to land however!

Just throwing my $0.02 in.

Subj:Drop Tanks -- the continuing saga

As I understand the rules, using drop tanks works like this:

1) The navigator computes a jump at the ship\'s *current*
displacement value (i.e., a 200-ton J-2 far trader w/ 50-ton drop tanks
now has J-1 capability)

2) After the navigator successfully computes the desired jump, the
engineer activates the jump drive

3) Upon activation, the jump drive begins to consume fuel (to
include fuel from the drop tanks) while charging the hull grid and/or jump
coils (whichever... :-)

4) At the critical energy threshold, the jump field forms about
the ship, and the ship exits our universe for a week

At no time once the jump process has been initiated can the ship safely
discard the drop tanks (without aborting the jump in progress).  Thus, the
ship *must* jump with the drop tanks.
Thanks.--  Franklin W. Cain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

According to canon drop tanks can indeed be dropped before jumping to
avoid degrading jump capability. There are many instances where this
has been mentioned.

have to have a  nuke reactor to run a slow ship.  I am not sure if mass is a
more realistic measure than displacement as you have to tunnel the ENTIRE
ship whether it is empty of full anyway.  I will try some numbers to clear

One general question, does a MHD turbine require Oxygen to run if so
wouldn\'t a ship have to carry LOTS of O^2 to run its engines.  Just a
thought on non-nuclear drives in deep space...

True, the tunneling costs are there, and everyone checks "Meson Guns"
when building a hull! ;-).  But the prices might vary from a mainworld
deep site, to a relatively shallow planetoid in a zero g (or microgravity,
to be more precise) environment.

The big trick (which isn\'t all that hard, actually) is coming up with
the toughness of a nickel-iron asteroid, then taking the towing costs,
etc. from CT/MT.  The only point of working this up on the beta list is
to have a consistant way of doing it (with as much untouched FFS as
possible).

My guess is that the toughness should be around 1 and the mass around 8.
I think someone on the beta list figured this out a while back when FFS
first came out.  I\'ll check the archives.

Then you calculate the internal structure volume and armor desired and
subtract from the total displacement.  It\'s pretty easy, actually, but it
would be nice to have it in a short, step by step format so you don\'t have
to jump to the Meson Gun chapter to design a hull :-)

Also, all the weapons will have to include armor, or be treated as
unarmored surface hits.  Still not hard at all, just a pain with FFS
(it\'ll be nice to have a standard set of assumptions as well so we can
use each others designs).

Another thing...

Towing a planetoid got a lot different with TNE.  Changing the orbit is
non-trivial now with fuel in short supply.  Belters will have an
interesting time as well finding the kinda rare (at least in the Sol
system) M type asteroid (nickel-iron) given fuel constraints. The
iron-magnesium silicate silicate types (S type) are more common.  C types
are the most common at about 75%, but carbonaceous ones might not make the
best hulls :-)

Actually the fuel use "problem" actually makes belt mining more
interesting to me (then again, I like the limits on fuel).

It\'s my bet that the tunneling costs might be similar to deep site
rules, but the cost of the total hull will have to do with its mass, and
it\'s orbit as found.

Guy in mining office:  "Well, we have just the right M-type for your
needs, but it\'s in a highly inclined orbit----this isn\'t gonna be cheap!"

interested to see the (currently conjectural) 2300 Adaptation to the TNE

Which brings me to another gripe: For a system that is so obviously
intended for multi-setting gaming, it sure is poorly set up. The basic TNE
book has too much background to be a core rules book for a multi-setting
system, and no tech data. FF&S is definitely filled with exotica that
should have waited for FF&S vol2 so that classic traveller bits could have
made it in.

        What about the classic SF mass-driver drive? Land on the chosen
planetoid and start tunneling right there, using the debris to fuel as mass
driver. You\'ll still not get anything approaching a G, but you\'ll have to
accept the slow transit.

That\'d do the trick.  Since you have to mine the material to use as
reaction mass, the workers would still have to live on an attached ship
though, and the labor would be a major cost (I\'d think), no?  Still, in
some cases this is a neat adventure seed:

Players are hired on as mining workers for asteroid hulls.  They ship
out in a converted merchant vessel, jump to the asteroid, and match
courses.  The MD needs to be set up, mining begins... now comes the
months of digging.  Maybe a seeker takes the miners for liberty trips in
cycles every few weeks 4 at a time.

Seed 1:  An accident (actually sabatoge) strands the miners on the rock, and
the next resupply is weeks away.  Accidents start taking the lives of
miners one after the other.  Virus?  A madman?  Perhaps the MD is slowly
bringing the rock towards not just an orbit near the main world, but
actually hitting the world itself! (a Virus controlled MD)  If the
mining was being done by a small operation, there might not *be* a
resuply ship, so the players (once they figure out what is going on)
have to prevent the disaster.

Seed 2:  The asteroid in question is part of a small swarm in a highly
eccentric and inclined orbit.  The Monitor hull being mined is pretty
large (8000+tons), and is surrounded (within several 10ths of a ls) by a
number of smaller rocks.  Most are useless, some have water ice useful
for fuel and life support.  Miners sometimes take a "cart" (a small open
craft with only a few gturns of fuel) and explore the other bodies
nearby.  Hijinks ensue, er, alien artifacts are found, maybe (hey, it\'s
late, folks :-)  This will only be useful until they start actually
moving the Monitor, then it leaves the other rocks behind...

Whatever you do, it\'s a reason for people to spend a lot of time in an
inhospitable place.

Yes, I\'m offically withdrawing my Tirem paper, as it too drasically
contradicts offical information. Consider it an instance where
imagination overran reality.

It will be reissued, after I find a suitable replacement site for it.

But I still like the idea of an asteroid belt created by smashing a gas
giant... anyone care to describe how such a belt would actually be like?
Would it contain massive belts of frozen gases?

last issue fcain@st6000.sct.edu (Franklin Cain) wrote loads of intersting stuff about
how droptanks must work.  However Cannon (smirk) quite clearly states
that drop tanks, well, drop.  This means that the J-2 far trader you
described loads up with a full fuel load, straps on full drop tanks, moves to
the 100 dia limit, charges it\'s hull grid, drops its drop-tanks and jumps 2
parsecs (with it\'s internal tanks still full).  The tanks you have described were
previously called external demountable tanks, what they are now, I don\'t
know.  Thus a drop-tank rent service sounds to me like a perfectly logical
thing to occur.  Now why is it that GDW makes it absolutely clear  how
droptanks work and then fails to incorporate them into the way things are
seen to usually work in the Traveller background...well we\'ve been here
before haven\'t we?

Please note that drop-tanks can also remain attached in the way you described, 
BUT keeping them on for the 1st jump means that a jump-2 ship gets to go only  3 instead of 4 parsecs.
Reference for all of this is High Guard and TCS.

    'body' => 'Having thought about the situation with Virus as mentioned on the
bulletin board, and discussing the matter with David (Hyphen)
Jaques-Watson, it has occured to me that the situation with Virus is
*very* similar to the situation with psionics in the MT era.

That is, one area espouses the benefits of beneficial variants, (RC and
some strains of Virus [esp peacemaker]) and one area believes it does not
have any right to existence (the Regency, and RQS, et al.)

This shapes things up to be similar to the Zhodani/Imperium when next the
RC (Zho-like) and Regency (Mini-Imperium) meet (Collide?) Some friction
and possible hostilities are likely in the early periods. One could also
liken the Rape of Trin, to the failed histrionics (sorry, psycho-history)
experiments conducted during the Imperium era (c. 800 I think).

Regarding the building of Starports; Much of the old material in Striker,
MT and High Guard are useful in this area. I suspect that FF&S and
Striker II would serve just as well.  The biggest part of the job is in
actually engineering (in real terms) the structures required. Fuel
tankage is simple. Armour Factor 10 Megaton hulls, buried in the ground;
Fuel purification rigs sited over them, or at least nearby, all close to
water, or ice if possible. Determining the max processing rate vis a vis
the demand for refined fuel requires some estimation (how many ships of
what size need how much fuel each.) This should (in TNE) take into
account the much increased maneuver fuel requirement. Before, Jump fuel
was the major factor, now it is the other way around. The game
ramifications of this have not yet been fully explored I think...

Engineering some of the other structures around the grounds is another
matter altogether. eg. what thickness concrete pad is required to support
say a 200-ton far trader? How much for a 5000 ton SDB? You probably
wouldn\'t land ships larger than that (at least not often, perhaps only
once each <g>).

Airports are simple; long concrete/ashphalt pad, taxiways of similar
construction, hardstanding is an area of same. Hangars and other
buildings would be made out of standard building materials (I would say
to a max of 5 floors, for armour factor 10 - 1 g field remember, higher
armour factors for higheer buildings.) Of course you don\'t need to build
your control tower using concrete. Using an equal thickness of BSD gives
a nice armour factor, helpful during accident/emergency, and harrassment.
I never said this would be CHEAP did I?

Some shields (nuke dampers maybe) and some defensive weapons (no lasers
or FG\'s but missiles and sandcasters would be VERY effective). Remember,
your starport can\'t maneuver so it might wan\'t to surrender to what it
can\'t outshoot. Of course there\'s always the cavalry (planetary navy). It
should be reasonably easy and relatively cheap to defend from ground
assault. (here is where a ships FG would be nice. I once mounted one on a
tank, but that\'s another design...)

Ground facilities would be composed of active and passive sensors,
perhaps linked to orbital active/passive arrays, radio communications
(laser is not appropriate, atmospheric effects, and air turbulence would
make targeting a laser comm an EIF) and finally an armored or shielded
powerplant to make the lights flash. Simply add all the power
requirements together and that\'s your power out requirements.

Now don\'t forget basic life support is STILL REQUIRED (lights/heat at
least, and what is an air conditioner anyway?) for habitable buildings,
Control Tower, office accomodations, etc but prob not needed in the hangars.

And finally, lets not forget car parking (even grav vehicles take room
when landed), office buildings, barracks for security, guard posts,
terminal buildings, roads, or at least lawns for flying over which will
require gardeners, and law enforcement provisions (bonded storage,
customs & immigration, import/export areas, baggage handling and
inspection, freight handling and inspection areas and equipment, garaging
for equipment, mechanics and workshop for electronic/mech./gravitic
technicians.) You should be near a city (you will need to service your
maintenance points, but not necessarily use your own crew (staff) to do
it). Get a maint contract (you still pay, but don\'t need to give them an
office or workshop, plus salary expense is reduced.)

Then there is the shuttle schedule; how often, why, where from/to and so
forth.

Then you need to consider what your construction facility looks like in
game terms...

It took David and I a good couple of months to develop the data on the
Tavonni Starport! But it certainly taught us what happens at a starport.
Starport procedures take on a whole new meaning when looked at from SPA
point of view. And it gives you a good idea where your berthing fees go.

Have fun Designing...

One day David will probably publish details for the Beowulf Down
starport, which is an instance of this general design guide.

Seeing the recent postings about the Tech Level equivalent
of 2300AD has made me think of TL progression within the
Traveller universe as a whole.  I\'d be interested to know if
anyone has any canonical information on TL\'s at various
points in the history of the Imperium - I\'ve  never seen
anything of that sort.  In this century, we\'ve progresed from
about TL5 (is that right? I can\'t check at the moment), to
borderline TL8, with (in some areas at least) an increasing
rate of technological development.

That\'s 4 TL\'s in 1 century - and that\'s without the added
impetus to technology of dealing with various other
technologically advanced species, with the cross-
fertilisation that this would presumably bring.

According to the GDW universe, it then took about 3000
years to progress toTL 15.

Am I just nitpicking?  Could there be a good reason for
the rate of technological progress to slow way way down?
Or it is it a convenient device to enable a complex plot of
the historical development of GDW\'s universe to take place.
(and I\'m not saying there\'s anything wrong with that, after
all, this is science *fiction*...)

Is it possible to produce a controlled mis-jump?  Ie to jump more sectors

Hi, I\'m Jim, joined the list just yesterday.  Lest it be said I\'m a
slacker:

Seven Ideas For Traveller: The New Era

Presented in no particular order.  Any Reformation Coalition game I run will
almost certainly involve at least half of the ideas below.

I. Drop the UWPs.  Like, immediately.  The Universal World Profile,
an eight-digit code to describe the basic characteristics of a
planet, was a useful thing to a vast, impersonal Imperium which
didn\'t care terribly much about its member worlds, nor about their
inhabitants.  But the Reformation Coalition is not like that.  If
anything, it\'s the opposite; it tries to be life-affirming, and to
recognize the uniqueness and wonder of each person and each world.
UWPs are a useful tool for gamemasters, but for the Reformation
Coalition they should be seen as the dangerous, dehumanizing tool
of the dead, dinosaurian Imperium.

II.  Along the same lines, drop the sector/subsector designations.
I don\'t like looking at the map of the RC and seeing it split
down the middle between Oriflamme subsector and Aubaine subsector.
It\'s silly.  Those designations were Imperial tools, and there
are better designations now.

III.  Change the AO strategy.  Sure, right now the Area of Operations
strategy is to expand to core-spinward, and Oriflamme has managed to
con them into limiting it to just seven parsecs, but I think that
going just seven parsecs core-spinward is foolish in the extreme.  My
reasoning is simple:  The Reformation Coalition has NO IDEA what
is going on rimward of them, or trailing, either.  Okay, core-trailing
are the Hivers, and they\'re theoretically safe, but from straight
trailing to rim-spinward there could be enormous Vampire Aslan Vargr
K\'Kree Darrian Star Trigger fleets casually swooping toward
our little republic.  And the RCES doesn\'t even seem to consider
that doing a little reconnaissance into Alpha Crucis sector might
be prudent.  Come ON.  Expand core-spinward, sure, but don\'t limit
the reconnaissance AO that much.

IV.  Push to Sol.  Sectorwise, the area immediately around the
RC looks like this:

Diaspora|Old Expanses| Hinterworlds
----+----+----
Solomani Rim|Alpha Crucis| Spica

I gather from old MegaTraveller source material that the
members of the Solomani Rim Confederation were, before the Great War,
fairly racist and xenophobic.  Okay, I can believe that.  But the
RC takes up a small piece of Old Expanses near both Diaspora and
Solomani Rim sectors; I cannot believe that it has never been
suggested that sending some ships toward SOL, you remember Sol,
right?  The one at the bright heart of Solomani Rim Sector, the one
from which all human life originates, that Sol?  Probably with more
relic technology and useful information than the RC could process
in a year, that Sol?  But no, we\'d rather expand into Diaspora.
I would put forth that, if nothing else, we should see a
semi-private effort to explore Solomani Rim sector and get to Sol
before the Guild (or worse) does; it has a lot of symbolic meaning,
if nothing else.

V.  Internal Strife.  There is strife in the RC.  There just isn\'t
enough for my tastes.  More fringe groups, xenophobic, luddite,
or just with a bone to pick with the current leadership, should
exist.  In another post I\'ll detail a few of these that I\'ve come
up with for my own use.  There\'s also little description of conflict
between, say, business and government.  In fact, things seem awfully
chaotic in that department, with the RC seeming to be quite willing
to "nationalize" almost any private assets it wants to.  I don\'t know
about anyone else, but if I had my starship nationalized and was told
to go to Diaspora sector for the government, I would be just a little
incredulous.

VI.  Lon Maggart Must Die.  Is this guy just Mister Perfect Leader
or what?  "Challenge" #77 has him addressing a hostile crowd on
Oriflamme and removing his bulletproof vest in a gesture of solidarity
and love.  Okay, I\'ll buy that, but wow, does the man have NO flaws?
He seems to be set up to be the Reformation Coalition\'s George
Washington, but even Washington did some things he later regretted,
and occasionally took flak from his political enemies.  He\'s a little
too perfect for my tastes, and the best solution I can think of
for this is to have him be assassinated by an Oriflammie.  This could
give us a really nice JFK figure that future leadership would work
hard to replace.

VII.  Expansion Timetable Changes.  The RC expansion timetable (the
"coreward strategy", which the RC seems to be using, rather than
the "consolidation strategy") looks like this:
Phase I: Overt ops in the primary AO with deep covert ops
in Diaspora sector.  Est. time 2 years, so, from New Era 1 - 3.
Phase II: Diplomatic blitz to integrate Diaspora sector
into the RC.  Estimated time 1 year.  NE 3-4.
Phase III: Extension of main AO to Massilia Sector, continued
consolidation of Diaspora. Estimated time 2 years.  NE 4-6.
Phase IV: "Simultaneous Expansion Outward", estimated time
unknown.  NE 6 onward.

O-o-okay.  Let me see if I\'ve got this right, looking over
my handy map.  Let\'s assume that the typical RCES/RCN ship has
Jump-2 ability, meaning they can get two parsecs in a week; thus,
a two parsec trip would take two weeks round trip.  There are eighteen
important targets in the primary AO, which extends as far out as
seven parsecs from the RC border.  If we assume that each of those
worlds is four parsecs from the border, on average, we\'re looking
at two jumps per world; thus each mission to each of the worlds in
the primary AO takes a month round-trip, six weeks if you include
time spent on the world.  Twenty-seven ship-months, thus, for one
mission to each world in the primary AO.  If we assume overlapping
missions in some cases, and multiple-world missions, we are still
looking at a big chunk of time.  Consider if you will the amount
of time it has taken to get the Middle East to come to a peace
agreement, or the remnants of Yugoslavia.  With a one-month minimum
time lag on any treaties or agreements, I see a real hard time getting
eighteen worlds consolidated into the coalition in two years.
And Phase II?  Getting ALL of Diaspora sector into the RC
in a YEAR?  At jump-2 you could barely REACH all of Diaspora sector
in a year, much less get back.  And Diaspora is a hostile environment,
between xenophobes, TEDs, Vampires, the Guild, and various pocket
empires.
I think the timeline should be extended to about a ten year
plan, personally.  But then again I\'m spending too much time
sympathizing with the Oriflammen.

RICE Paper #SM-1106-A

\'The Jewell Cup - An ancient Solomani sporting tradition survives on Jewell\'
by Lir Shiraa, 047-1202

More than any other human race, the Solomani were a fiercely competitive
people.  Many socioligists attribute the famous Solomani fractiousness to
the fact that they alone rose to civilisation in their aboriginal
environment.  Their suitability to this environment caused population
pressures relatively early in their history.  At any rate, long before they
discovered the jump drive, Solomani competitiveness manifested itself in the
form of nearly constant warfare.  As their weaponry grew in destructive
power the Terran\'s were forced to subsume their aggressiveness into sporting
contests, but lost none of their aggression in the process.

In the 18th and 19th Terran Centuries (c. -2800 to -2600), the planet-bound
Terran\'s were divided into rival blocs, the legacy of earlier conquests and
colonisation.  The most powerful of these was the British Empire, which at
it\'s height covered one-sixth of Terra\'s land area and encompassed nearly a
quarter of it\'s people.  The British made efficient enough soldiers, but
were more of a mercantile people than a martial one.  A certain distaste for
violence was embedded in their culture, this led them to channel their
aggression into many sporting pursuits, some of which have survived to this day.

The British played many games, but perhaps their favorite was the game of
cricket.  By the later 20th Century Terran, cricket was played in nearly all
of Britain\'s former colonial possessions, and was a professional sport in a
dozen nations.

The conquering Terrans took their games with them to the stars.  As the
mantle of rulership passed from the Vilani to the Solomani with the
establishment of the Rule of Man, Terran culture became the new standard by
which other races judged themselves.  naturally, manu aspects of Terran
culture were absorbed by their subjects - including this curious English game.

The Vilani in particular were attracted to this complex and lengthy sporting
pursuit.  Many historians have made comparisons between the Vilani and
Terran English characters, particularly their shared conservatism and
mercantilism.  Whatever the cause, the Vilani took to cricket with vigour.
The first recorded game was played on Vland in -2160, when the crew of the
tCS \'Swiftsure\' played a limited overs match between themselves.  In -2157,
Sharurshid sponsored the first recorded match between the Terrans and a
Vilani XI.

As the Rule of Man collapsed, the game survived on a number of worlds, and
was still being played in one form or another when these worlds were
absorbed into the growing Third Imperium.  Imperial colonists took the game
with them to the Spinward Marches, and the game was standardised on it\'s
original rules following the admission of Terra into the Imperium in 588.
The game is still played today on a number of worlds within the Regency,
including the industrialised world of Jewell (1106/Spinward Marches).

The game is played with a passion on Jewell during the summer months (a
tradition only, as the stadia in which the game is played are invariably
enclosed against Jewell\'s tainted atmosphere).  From school teams through to
the heavily sponsored Jewell League competition, locals support their teams
with a fanatical fervour.  Towards the end of the season, the leading teams
representing Jewell\'s Administrative Districts play a knockout competition
known as the Sharurshiid Cup.  The Cup winner wins the right to play in one
of the biggest events on the Jewell social calender - the \'Jewell Cup\'.

On the last day of summer, thousands of fans pack into Admiral Plankwell
Stadium to watch the season\'s leading team play a limited overs contest
against a Regency Navy side (the \'Navy XI\').  Those unable to get tickets to
the game watch via holovid broadcast, and large parts of the planet come to
a virtual standstill.  For weeks beforehand, the coming game is the subject
of endless discussion and speculation.

While on Jewell on assignment for the Regency Insitute for Cultural
Education, I was invited by the Navy to view the big game.  I confess to
having only the most basic knowledge of cricket (and that was the product of
an afternoon\'s frantic research the day before the match).  At any rate, the
social aspects of the event interested me far more than the contest itself.

The talk in Jewell\'s bars and taprooms was centred on the match in the
preceeding weeks. Much talk centred on the Navy\'s team, particularly the
inclusion of a Vargr Ensign named Gvouur in the named squad.  Given the
dislike of Vargr and Zhodani on Jewell, it wasn\'t surprising to hear many
disparaging, some of them quite humourously so, remarks about the Vargr\'s
abilities and habits.  One particular gem involved a description of the
Vargr picking up the ball with his mouth, then running it (rather than
throwing it) back to the bowler.  The general consensus was that the local
team, from Crerar District, would retain the Cup for the second successive year.

The Navy Team arrived five days before the match, amid much fanfare.  A
press conference was held at the starport, in which the team captain,
Commander Ramon Esterhazy, dismissed rumours that Ensign Gvouur had been
selcted as a \'sop to Regency cosmopolitanism\'.  An enthusiastic Gvouur
answered a few questions from the local journalists, then the team was
whisked away to the hotel by grav bus.  Their first training session that
evening was heavilly attended by media pundits and interested locals.  The
Crerar District team arrived the next day, with much the same reaction from
the locals.

Enthusiasm for the game built to a fever pitch over the next few days.  A
few locals who had attended the Navy training sessions admitted grudgingly
that the Vargr appeared to know what he was doing, but the \'smart money\'
remained on the Crerar District XI.  A parade of both teams through the
center of Amadan City the next day.  Led by the Imperial 212th Fleet
Marching Band, the two teams travelled by motorcade to a civic reception
hosted by Senator Andries Piett, senior senator for Jewell.  Thousands of
locals crowded the thouroughfare, lending a holiday atmosphere to an
occasion which would better fitted the return of a triumphant army.

On the morning of the match, I took my seat in the Navy boxes while a highly
enthused Subcommander explained the finer points of the game to me.  I was
surrounded by a sea of humaniti - almost two hundred thousand spectators had
packed into the Admiral Plankwell Stadium.  Uncountered numbers of banners
dotted the crowd, many painted in the black and gold Navy colors as well as
the maroon and gold of the Crerar XI.  The two teams eventually made their
way onto the stadium amid tremendous cheering, and stood to attention while
the Navy band played \'Take Hold of the Flame\'.  The game was afoot.

I must confess, much of the game was indecipherable to an observer with my
limited knowledge.  As a social spectacle, it was a rival to the coronation
of Regent Caranda in 1090.  As the first bowler began his run up to the
delivery point, the crowd erupted into a chant of \'Lillee, Lillee...\' (the
origins of the chant are unknown, but are believed to date back to Old
Earth).  The Vargr Gvouur proved to be an able sportsman, and was a superb
fielder as well as a very capable batsman.

Crerar District never really looked comfortable batting against a potent
Navy attack, but managed to struggle to 9/223 from their allotted 50 overs.
Jenna Amrasil, a \'leg spinner\' from the 88th Fleet, took the bowling honours
for Navy with 4 wickets from her allotted 10 overs.  In reply, Navy were
seldom troubled as they surpassed Crerar\'s total with almost three overs to
spare.  After losing the captain with the score on 0, Mendan Lishinkhu and
Farroughl Gvouur decimated Crerar\'s attack, putting on a 160 run partnership
before the Vargr\'s dismissal for 74.  Lishinku, the unquestioned player of
the match, achieved his \'century\' (100 runs) off the final ball of the day
as he guided Navy to victory.

As the crowd filed out of the stadium to get merrily drunk, I reflected on
the nature of the contest.  Locals had pitted themselves against the pride
of the Regency Navy and lost, but the real winner was unity.  Solomani
aggressiveness, so often the cause of violence and suffering, had been
turned into a potent tool for forging unity and loyalty within \'Fortress
Jewell\'.  Tomorrow, as hung-over workers made their way to the factories and
industrial plants of Jewell, this world would continue to be a vital part of
the Regency.

Hear, hear.  What government issues maps of itself split down the

Makes perfect sense to me.  In fact, were I in charge of the RCES, I\'d
send my own guys into the AO and hire freelancers to look in the other
direction.

This one I\'m not so sure about.  Sure, personally, I\'d want to go.  But
the Solomani are horrible, nasty, evil people who rip your head off and
suck your blood, right?  Maybe we don\'t want to tell them where we are.

This sounds rather like copyright infringement to me.  If you do this,
what reason do most people have to buy the book itself?  Particularly
at a time when GDW seems to be in difficult straits, this seems grossly
unethical as well as unkind.

"Unofficial" specs, OF YOUR OWN CREATION, would, of course, be acceptable
by all parties, I\'d suspect, including GDW\'s lawyers.

I think you mean _4_ diplomats, not 14 (the original design had 1 Ambassador

2.DROP TANK USAGE

Franklin said:
>As I understand the rules, using drop tanks works like this:

Actually, no... [prepares to whack people with canon]:
"Disposable fuel tanks may be added to the ship to increase its range. These
L-Hyd tanks are fitted to the outside of the ship, and drop away before jump.
The result is more interior space for crew and passengers. Such tanks must be
replaced each time they are used, so they are practical only on runs to
civilised areas, or to increase fuel capacity to allow several jumps. L-Hyd
tanks are installed outside the hull, and increase the total tonnage of the
ship; drives are reduced in their efficiency based on the total tonnage of the
ship. With tanks retained, efficiency is decreased, and jump capacity is
reduced; when the tanks drop away, tonnage is reduced, and the drive efficiency
is increased."
_Book 5, High Guard_, GDW, USA, 1980, p27.

"A drop tank is designed to be released once it is drained, allowing improved
performance by the ship."
_FF&S_, GDW, USA, 1993, p62.

"Close Escort...Jump varies with situation. With drop tanks installed and
retained, jump-4 and 4-G. With drop tanks installed and dropped, jump-5 and 5-G.
With drop tanks not installed, jump-2 and 5-G."
_Supplement 9: Fighting Ships_, GDW, USA, 1981, p17.

"Gazelle-class Close Escort...Jump Performance: 3 with tanks attached (1120m^3),
5 without (1260m^3)."
_Brilliant Lances Technical Booklet_, GDW, USA, 1993, p23.
(ie. the extra fuel powers the larger jump, but with the smaller displacement)

>From reading the SOM, the procedure is closer to this:
1) The navigator computes a jump at the ship\'s _eventual_ displacement value
   (eg. a 400-ton J-3 Gazelle will have J-5 capability when it is 300-tons);
2) After the navigator successfully computes the desired jump, the engineer
   fires up the jump drive and charges up the zuchai crystal energy sinks
   (aka "capacitors");
3) When the capacitors are fully charged, the drop tanks are released;
4a) (With hull grid) Part of the capacitor charge is released to "warm up" the
    grid, then the rest is released in an instant to fully power the grid (all
    co-ordinated by the jump governor);
4b) (With coils) The capacitor energy is released into the coils [BORING!];
5) At the critical energy threshold, the jump field forms about the ship, and
   the ship tumbles into j-space...
_Starship Operator\'s Manual Vol 1_, DGP, USA, 1998, paraphrase of pp12-13, 64.

[whacking mode off]

BTW, I *never, ever* understood the Gazelle-class. OK, it might be fair to have
Al Morai use the things; after all, they are on a standard run, and drop tanks
should always be available. But the vessel is supposed to be a quasi-military
craft - and an escort, to boot! Fair enough for a deep-penetration scout to have
drop tanks - it can bug out at high-jump if it needs to. But the Gazelle has its
"normal" jump cut in half (OK, High Guard stats only)! What a useful design -
NOT!

In other words, I am *NOT* convinced that drop tanks have any place on a
military vessel (Eurisko\'s results aside). Merchant shipping on standard runs;
yes, this is very feasible. Can anyone explain the benefits to military ships?

Ben said:
>Another point - drop tanks can be used to carry maneuver fuel too...

Just like current-day planes. Wait - what is this I see - p33 of FF&S talks
about "Fuel drop tanks...may be attached...if [the hardpoints] have fuel
intake plumbing"! Hey, it DOES work for planes!

Eric said:
>(possibly using some sort of tiny gas thruster to clear the 1m limit)

They actually need to clear the 100-diameter limit... I just say that they are
designed with a miniscule quantity of excess gas, that is just enough to
propel them away.

I *still* like the image of _The Martian Way_...

3.JAMES\' REVIEW OF THE RSB

Now, before anyone flames him, James does have a few reasonable points to raise.
I have said before on this list that to really play a "proper" game of TNE you
should create new characters in the RC, rather than pull your old ones into
the Regency - "you can\'t go home again". Reading the RSB is both interesting
and sad, much like reading the DGP adventure set on Terra. You realise that if
you pull the characters across, them most of the people they used to know will
be dead. Then you realise that you probably would be better off NOT pulling them
across; it would be better to use new PC\'s in the Regency as well. THEN you
realise that the original characters will be dead...etc etc.

However, I disagree that Dave broke with his principles. Rather, I think that
the Regency and the RC are an attempt to run two sorts of games. Remember my
post on T$R? What GDW are attempting, I think, is to have two game settings
within the one universe (rather than the T$R multiverse situation). Why not?
It\'s a big galaxy out there.

I also disagree that the RC is the "main" setting. Dave said that both areas
would be developed in parallel. They are just different (differences don\'t
necessarily make one thing superior to another, y\'know; peas and carrots, men
and women, white and black and yellow, none are superior to the other).

As to including all those subsectors, I agree with Dave\'s comment that he would
have been apologising to players "for at least 3 years" - I would have been one
of the players. Besides, there is a wealth of information slotted in alongside
the maps in order to bring certain areas to life. If you want more, and have
net access, why not grab all the RICE papers you can and use them? Alvin, you
should point James to this mailing list. Even if he can\'t use the Regency gear,
there is a heap that he could use - for example, the excellent Dark Century
Amber Zone by Brendan O\'Donovan - which IS set in the RC.

I think that James\' review is fair, for a person who is new to Traveller.
Really, the RSB is only useful to long-term players who want to be updated to
the New Era. The overwhelming amount of information presented, that is based
on all that has gone before, must be difficult for new starters to get a handle
on. It is as though you only have half (or maybe 70%) of the story.

Alvin, can you post this review-review to James and whatever list he is on?
I don\'t have newsgroup access.

4.RE: MONKEY SUITS

Poor Tom must have mixed up his mailing lists. I wonder what message the wedding
invitees were sent?!? Anyway, here\'s opportunity for someone to post another
Olga-like Amber Zone...;-)

I\'m tired. Off to bed.

Thanks for the idea - I\'ve been trying to work out how best to describe
the "Ice-cubes", Tavonni\'s furthest planetoid belt.

Keep looking, Alvin, and just reduce the size down - remember that Terra
is only size 8. You have plenty of room in between 8 and 22 to put your
planetoid.

When military ships use drop tanks to jump to hostile system, they
arrive to their destination with their fuel tanks FULL. So here are some
benefits:

1. They are no need to refuel them using tankers or gas giant before any
action.
2. They can immediately jump away if enemy fleet is too strong.
3. They have much more g-turns (using jump fuel), if they choose to
fight.

So I can\'t see why military ships jump to enemy system without using
drop tanks if those are available.

RICE PAPER
Lewis/Aramis/Spinward Marches (X427344-8)

Physical Appearance: Lewis is a small world with a diameter of
approximately 6400 kilometers, a very thin, tainted atmosphere, and
large salty oceans covering three-quarters of the surface of the
planet. A young world, Lewis is one of several satellites of Zenthra,
the only gas giant in the system.
      The night sky as seem from Lewis is one of the wonders of the Imperium,
First the gas giant Zenthra has gorgeous multicolored bands. The ring of Zenthra
has been described as "A ring of diamonds."  The other four satellites
of Zenthra are uninhabited, but they are bright in the night sky, which
adds to the beauty of the night sky. Finally the magnetic fields of
Zenthra send charged particles into the upper atmosphere of Lewis,
creating striking auroras almost every night.
     The planet itself is equally beautiful.  It has large peaceful oceans
which come ashore onto sandy beaches.  The land is covered by a huge variety
of plants.  The weather on Lewis is fairly mild.  There is almost no axial
tilt, yielding one constant season.  One of the few drawbacks to the
planet is the Yabba Tree.  The Yabba Tree is not really a tree, but as
it is a tall (3-5 meters) leafy plant,most people call it a tree.  The
tree and its 23 subspecies are the mostprolific species on the planet,
and are found on all 6 continents.  Whilethe Yabba has huge flowers,
that are extremely attractive, they release huge
amounts of pollen.  Unfortunately humans are highly allergic to this pollen.
Vargr and other species derived from Terran stock also react to the pollen.
The pollen accounts for the tainted atmosphere in the UPP.  People who
breath the pollen have a severe allergic reaction, resulting in trouble
breathing, hives and an accelerated pulse. This proves fatal about half
of the time,unless treated.  The treatment is fairly routine, but
involves a fairly extensive series of injections.   After several years
of being on planet ninety percent of the people become used to the
pollen, and no longer have to wear filter masks.  The remaining ten
percent of the population never becomes used to it, and is forced to
continue wearing the masks.  For this reason, all buildings have
extensive filtration systems.  The planet\'s atmosphere is very thin and
requires the use of compression masks.

Orbital Motion: Lewis orbits the gas giant Zenthra in just over seven standard
days. It is tidally locked with Zenthra. So one side always faces the planet.
Since Zenthra is so big in the sky, (3.75 degrees, over seven times the
angular size of Luna), it eclipses the sun each once each time Lewis
orbits it. The eclipse lasts about two hours. Inselberg (see below) is
situated in a prime viewing site for this, and most visitors view the
eclipse several times.

History: Lewis has been owned by the Tukera Family since it was granted to them
by Emperor Zhakirov in 684, for services rendered.  The Tukeras used it as
family retreat, and vacation spot.  They would also reward Tukera Line employees
with luxurious vacations there.  In 948, Baroness Belinda, the Tukera family
administrator in charge of the planet, needed to raise money to cover
massive gambling debts. She sold settlement rights, for the continent
of Desmoaned, to a colonization firm from Rethe/Regina, and used the
proceeds to settle her gambling debts.  Upon the learning that part of
their private vacation spot had been sold to simple farmers, the rest
of the family was infuriated. Belinda was removed
from her post and disinherited.  She fled to Rugbird/Aramis, where she
died in an argument with a Vargr pit boss.  Over the next few years the
family tried to get the settlement contract thrown out, but the courts
ruled that the family had given Baron Belinda full rights to negotiate,
and they would have to live with her mistake.
     The settlers were fed up with life on Rethe, a poor crowded world.  They
decided to strike out and build a new life. They were planning on shipping out
to District 268, but when the land on Lewis came on the market, they snapped
up the once in a lifetime offer.  They set out to build a settlement that was
a pleasant place to raise a family.  All around them they saw natural beauty,
they pledged to preserve that beauty for future generations.  They designed
their settlement to have minimal impact on the environment.  They practiced
organic farming. Instead of using pesticides, they released geneered
predators that ate the pests.  They designed their homes and buildings
to blend in with the natural scenery.  Some homes blend in so well that
they are hard to spot from a distance.
     The family offered to buy out the colonists, but the now thriving colony
refused.  The Tukeras then tried less pleasant means of persuasion. In
963 the colonists were able to persuade the Minstery of Justice to
launch an investigation.  After two weeks, the Imperial inquisitor
ruled that Tukera was innocent of all charges.  Soon thereafter he
purchased a large and expensive yacht and retired.
     The Tukera seemed to accept the settlers, occasionally
administrators would try to buy out the settlers, but the settlers
steadfastly refused to budge.  The impasse lasted until Baronet Rogarr
was named administrator of all Tukera Family property in the Marches in
the year 1073.  The thought of settlers on his beloved Lewis, goaded
him to no end.  Finally he decided on a plan of action.  Rogarr had
gone to school at the Imperial University on Capital. One of his
classmates and best friends, was Derrin Aeontalla, who was now Marquis
Aeontalla of Aramis.  With the help of Marquis Aeontalla and several
other nobles indebted to the Tukera family. Rogarr was able to persuade
the Imperial Court to declare Lewis a Red Zone, forbidding all traffic
with the planet. With the exception of Tukera family ships, who were
granted a special dispensation allowing them access.
    The Tukeras made a final offer to the settlers; middle passage, and
1000cr each if they would leave now.  A few thousand settlers took the
offer. They thought life under an Imperial Interdiction would be
unbearable.  The remainder decided that Lewis was their home, and they
wouldn\'t leave to make some sniveling noble and his toadies happy.  One
of the chief instigators of this response was
Dwayne Muurgan.  His fiery orations stirred the blood of the settlers and gave
them a will to resist.  He thought that once the planet was sealed, the
Tukeras would move in with hired guns, and try to exterminate the
settlers. To forestall this he had the settlers manufacture small arms,
so that they could defend their homes.
      Even though the Tukeras had done some unpleasant things in their past,
they weren\'t about to send in mercenaries to slaughter over 80,000 men,
women, and children. Baronet Rogarr thought it best if they simply
waited until the settlers gave up.  He ordered that each year a liner
land at the settlement and offer free passage to anyone willing to give
up all claim to the planet.  For the first few years no one took the
Tukeras up on their offer, but after a few years, a few settlers would
leave each year, ten one year, fifty the next.  These emigrants are one
of the few sources of infomation about conditions on lewis.  By 1100,
seventhousand settlers had chosen to leave.  But that still left over
seventy thousand still on the planet.
        When the settlers bought rights to settle on Lewis, those rights
only pertained to the continent Desmoaned and the archipelago to the north.
Desmoaned is a smallish continent, about four million square
kilometers.  The interdiction restricts the settlers to this territory
and no other.  Tukera family security monitors the continent for
violations. The penalty for violating the boundaries, even accidently,
is exile from the planet.
       The Civil War slowed down the flow of visitors. Only those
Tukera employees from the Domain of Deneb could get to Lewis.  This
created a bit of economic strain, but Tukera was willing to absorb the
cost. There was some talk of opening up the planet to paying customers.
But this talk was quickly squashed by Tukera higher ups.  They thought
the exclusiveness of the planet, was well worth the cost.
     The settlers received little news of the Civil War, and it did not
impact their lives at all.  At least that is what they thought.  On
152-1119, three Vargr Corsair Destroyers landed at the Settlement and
looted and burned most of it.  After filling their holds with booty,
they took off, but as a final act of cruelty bombarded the settlement
from orbit.  Three quarters of the settlers, over 45,000 people, died
in the attack.  It remains one of the more senseless Vargr attacks in
Regency history.
     Tukera personal on planet immediate offered their help to the
surviving settlers.  Unfortunately the small hospital at Inselberg
would be swamped with all the victims, but Tukera offered to ship
anyone in need of medical assistance, to Patnir, the nearest star
system with adequate medical facilities.  Of course, no one who left
would ever be allowed to return.  Most settlers decided a life in exile
would be better than no life at all.  After the attack and subsequent
evacuation, only five thousand settlers were left on planet. Those who
had survived resolved that nothing would force them from their land.
Many survivors blamed Tukera for the attack, suggesting that the Vargr
were working for Tukera or at the least Tukera did not stop the attack.
  Tukera family spokespersons vehemently denied these charges, "Our
system defense boats were patrolling the outer system, they rushed to
the planet as soon as the alarm was raised, but were too late.  The
entire Tukera family sends it\'s deepest sympathy to these victims of
Vargr aggression."
     The remaining settlers set about rebuilding their home.  There was
enough food at outlying farms, to get them through the first growing
season. The first year was the roughest, but by pulling together, the
settlers were able to overcome the difficulties.  It took the settlers
five years to rebuild their homes.
     In 1125 they reorganized their settlement, and created a
government that they still use to this day.  Before this they had no
formal government, now they elected a Governor, and ten Speakers.   The
Governor would serve for life, and was charged with freeing the planet
from its interdiction.  The settlers elected Justin Muurgan, grandson
of Dwayne Muurgan. He was only 29 when elected.  He still serves as
Governor to this day.  When asked about the length of his political
career, he responded,"The Governor serves for life, and I refuse to die
anywhere but where I was born."
     The Speakers are elected every two years.  Note that there are an
even number of Speakers.  The settlers value consensus, and wanted
their representative to come to an agreement, not just out vote each
other.  The Speakers find issues that effect the settlement, and figure
out a solution that is best for the most people.  Most of the issues
are fairly mundane, such things as land use, new construction, and
farming schedules.
     When the Tukera liner came in 1126, the Governor was the only settler
to take passage off planet.  He was also the last settler to ever leave
the planet.  Governor Muurgan immediately got in contact with the survivors
of the Vargr attack who had been evacuated. He gathered them together on
Xenon Station, a beat up mining station, located in the Patnir System.
Once they were settled, he set out to convince the Domain of Deneb to lift
the interdiction on his homeworld.  For decades he has spoken to every
Imperial official, that would see him. To each of these he told the
history of his world.  Most sympathized, but were unable or unwilling to do
anything to help.
    Governor Muurgan also spread the word about Lewis, to the media, he
would talk to any reporter, no matter how small their publication.  His
passionate pleas have aroused a great deal of public support on several
worlds, notably La Belle/Lanth, Zivije/Rhylanor and Thingen/Sabine.  It
has become a fashionable cause, there are rallies, fund raisers, and
lots of speeches. Some of these people have tried to create a boycott
of Tukera Lines and related companies, but
it has had little effect so far.  Tukera Lines has suffered since the
Domain of Deneb was cut off from the rest of the Imperium.  Their
public connection to Margret\'s faction hurt them in the eyes of many
Domain residents, who saw Margret as another schemer who was helping to
destroy the Imperium. Today they are fraction of what they used to be,
but the family that was left in the Domain still has enough money and
power to affect their destiny.
    When Norris announced the Representational Reforms, Gov Muurgan thought
that he would be selected as Lewis\'s representative, but the Tukera family
were able to convince the Regency that they should select a representive.
Since this time the Tukera family has becoming one of the leaders of the
Resistance movement, trying to obstruct the reforms at any cost.
    Most members of the Regency Senate have been reluctant to overturn
the interdiction of Lewis, since it was an Imperial decree, and if the Senate
were to overturn it, this would signify that the Senate could overrule
the Emperor.  While currently there is no emperor, many members cling
to the hope that there will someday be one. Lately some of the more
democratic members of the Senate have taken up the cause, mainly using
it as a tool against Tukera and the Resisters. They see it as an
example of what the Resisters stand for and how they harm people. One
small victory they have managed to achieve, is that the new UPP in the
1201 census figures, features the Settlers\'s tech level and government
code.  This is a small victory, but it is a first step.  Gov Muurgan
does not care that some supporters care more about damaging the
Resisters than Lewis, he just wants his home to be free.

Society: The settlers have been able to create a self sufficient society.  It
helps that they area farming community and can grow their own food supplies.
They do not have a great deal of manufacturing capabilities, mostly small
machine shops which hand make parts on demand. They are able to keep
running the few mechanical devices that they did possess.  These are
mostly farming vehicles. Their medical facilities are top rate, and
able to cope with almost any problem.  There is one hospital for the
entire settlement it is located in Grenwinae.  Which is the only true
city the settlers possess. The hospital has about a dozen helicopters
which it uses to transport patients, and deliver doctors to the
outlying farms.  Power for the settlement is generated by a
hydroelectric power plant, which uses wave power. Most people use
animal powered wagons and carts to get around.  They find these easy to
maintain, and also have a very low impact on the environment.  The
settlement is very close knit.  They have weekly gatherings where they
talk and socialize.  These gatherings involve dancing, music, and
other performances by the citizens of the settlement. There are no pure
entertainers, the settlement is not big enough to support nonproductive members.
These gatherings also serve to draw the community together, making it
an extended family.
     The Tukera facilities on the planet are centered at Inselberg, a small
resort on the largest continent, Greenhaven.  To avoid the Yabba
pollen, the city is domed.  The city has several large luxury hotels, a
casino,  amusement park, dance clubs, concert amphitheater, golf
courses, and dozens of other amusements for guests of the Tukeras.  The
restaurants are some of the best in teh subsector.  Guests are pampered
the moment they step foot off the starship door.  Everything is the
best that money can buy, but guests don\'t have to pay for anything,
Tukera picks up the tab for everything.  Everything except for the
casino, there you have to risk your own money.  The staff at inselberg
exists solely to fulfill the slightest whim of guests.
     Inselberg is not the only resort on the planet.  Glacier Point is
a resort on the Northern tip of Greenhaven.  It specializes in winter
activities, such as skiing and ice sailing.  There are several small
villas located on isolated islands to the south of Greenhaven.  These
are available for guests who prefer a more isolated vacation.  Tukera
also runs several grav yachts which tour the planet, showing off the
wonders of the planet.  These yachts even plunge to the bottom of the
ocean, to show off the fascinating marine life.  Life on these
yachts is not austere, the yachts are bigger then most starships.  They
include ballrooms, swimming pools, and everything else the idle rich would want.
There are several other sites, that are of interests to guests; Crystal
Caves are a large cavern system 75 kms northwest of Inselberg.  Most
visitors take a day trip from Inselberg. There is an active shield
volcano located on the western edge of Greenhaven.  This is one of the
largest shield volcanoes in the Regency.
     Security is very tight around Inselberg.  Tukera officials refuse
to disclose exact figures, but it is believed that there are about five hundred
Tukera Line security troops on planet. In antebellum times, there were
hundreds of top of the line security robots, but it is presumed that
use of these has fallen off since the Virus.  Security, while tight, is
very transparent to the guests at Inselberg, most never notice it.  It
is unknown why Tukera keeps such a large security force, on a
resortworld.  It is possible that they fear attacks from the settlers
on Desmoaned.  There is a small class D starport at Inselberg.  While
small it is one of the nicest looking class D starports in the Regency.
     Tukera biologists have developed a partial vaccine for the the
Yabba Tree\'s pollen.  It allows a person to breath the pollen, with no
ill effects, but a toxic residue builds up.  After a month, use must be
discontinued. Severe nerve damage can occur if use does persist.  The
vaccine, allows vacationers to tour the fabulous beaches of Lewis, go
skiing, all without dealing with messy filter masks. Though compression
masks are still required.

far from it.  It is currently undergoing severe vulcanism. This makes
the planet extremely dangerous.

  Oh, most excellent... now, has anyone got a planet where the two main
factions can be characterised by a love for rugby league on one hand, and
rugby union on the other? <g>
  Of course, characterising cricket as helping unite a culture is
interesting - but I guess by this stage their third umpire\'s good enough
that allegations of ball tampering etc wouldn\'t hold water... :)

TL 11 at the start of the interstellar wars, TL 12 by the end.

2nd Imperium (Rule of man): Solomani TL12, Vilani TL11.

Long night: down to TL 9-11.... if that!

3rd Imperium: Sylean expansion... TL 9-11 ?
Solomani Rim War TL 14.
Fifth Frontier War TL 15.

Maybe someone out there with their books handy can give you full references

I\'m not aware of any, and I think I\'ve seen all the
published GDW/DGP canon.

That\'s right.  I think we\'re borderline TL9, now, in some
areas, but lacking fusion and gravitics, the real hallmarks
of TL9.

Isn\'t there a Calvin & Hobbes book called "Scientific
Progress Goes Boink!"?  Maybe that\'s what happens.

Remember, the Vilani developed jump drive in -9235, but
only developed J-2 in -5430!  And they were still at J-2 by
the time they met the Terrans in -2422.  So that\'s TL9 to
TL10 in 4,000 years, with _no_ advances for another 3,000
years.  That\'s counter-intuitive, to say the least.  The
explanation seems to be that the Vilani culture, with its
emphasis on stability at the cost of everything else,
slowed down research.

So then the Terrans, whose culture(s) could never be
accused of over-emphasizing stability at the cost of
technical and scientific progress, conquered the Vilani.
Soon thereafter, however, scientific progress slowed down
for the Terrans.  Did the Terrans adopt too much of the
Vilani life-style?  The canon says the opposite -- the
majority Vilani tried to Terrarize themselves, even
adopting Solomani surnames.

Well, that\'s not much of an explanation, I\'m afraid.  I\'ll
try to do better later.

Actually, TL 9 at initial expansion - I think that they obtained a 60 pc
"Sphere of influence", pre-1st Imperium.

Consult the MegaT "Referee\'s Companion".  I think GDW still has copies of it.
If interest continues, I can bring my copy from home...

Either this, or the cost to change Tech Levels rises, the higher you go.
I doubt it: I think the Zho\'s spent c. 3000 years at TL 8, and who knows
how long certain Droyne worlds spent at, say, TL 5.

I have started to design starship with weight/thurst ratio rather than
size/thrust. In my work with this I try to save much as possible on the
weight of the ship as there can be considerably savings on this as more gee
hours, smaller crew, cheaper craft and so on.

And now I ask: Is it OK to leave a gap in the hull to the drive plunge? As
the rules stands there is no hole at all. Cutting a hole will save several
tons on the design. The drawback is that a hit in this hull location will go
straight to the drive without passing through armor.

If the drive is on there may be some protection.

I would like your thoughts and comments on this.

Wouldn\'t it be for reasons similar to why drop tanks are used
on military aircraft today- to extend their range and time over target?

I would expect that the military can expect much less consistency in
the length of jump required for their vessels than merchant traffic
(who knows where the front will be tomorrow - and who will be nearest).
Military organizations today try to stay flexible (at least in reaction
capability), why would this change in the future?

As Niven pointed out *long* ago in "Theory and Practice of
Teleportation", any sort of receiverless or transmitterless
teleportation isn\'t a transport system, it\'s a recipe for a short, ugly
war.

So I\'d say that you need jump gates at each end. Otherwise things
degenerate rather badly.

Oh yeah, in case the terminology confused anybody, a "transmitterless"
teleport is something that can reach out and grab things with no
hardware needed at the "sending" end. This allows all sorts of "snatch
& grab tricks and other nastiness. (How well do you fight if I just
grabbed all your missiles? Or all your *fuel*?)

A "receiverless" one is one that can dump stuff someplace without
needing a receiver. This lets you do things like drop a fusion bomb in
the other guys engine room. Or in the case of a jump gate drop some
truly *huge* nasties into his system.

The Star Trek transporter is a medium range device that can do either.
And if it wasn\'t for "shields" stopping it, it\'d make most episodes
real short... :-)

   Dave Nilsen is now working as a security analyst for Fort Knox

GDW, completing work on ``Armor 21`` and developing some more
materials for the Regency.

   Loren Wiseman has scaled back his role at GDW, working there on
a part time basis.  I have no further information on what his title is
or what his duties are at this time.

   James Cambias, a frequent contributor to Challenge, is being brought
on board to write the final two parts of the Virus Redux Epics.  I have
no further information on Mr. Cambias, though it would appear that he
will be picking up some of the slack created by Dave\'s and Loren\'s

>III Drop the Sector/Subsector...

Yes...I think very much that the RC should be presented as a single
map, but also, realistically, many of the \'old\' designations will be
hard to shake, particularly at the subsector level.  Remember, one of
the stated reasons for the breakup of the Imperium is increasing
\'nationalism\' at the sector and subsector levels, so many people will
still identify themselves as from the \'XYZ subsector\'.  Also, the
only remaining navigational aids, maps and library data are all
organized into the old imperial system, and I doubt that the
pragmatists of the RC are going to spend the time, effort, and money
to change all their libraries to match what is, essentially, a
ideological point.  Of course, 50-60 years from now will be a
different story indeed. Still, the imperial geography is still going
to be the common ground for all the people the RC will contact in the

True, but GDW may have something up it\'s sleeve here, I think. Look
carefully at the NE map in the TNE manual.  There\'s a big gray
\'Frontiers\' blob right where the RC is, and just spinward are two
more, smaller ones. Earlier Hiver experiments? Hiver insurance
policies against the RC turning hostile? Nothing GDW has said that
I\'ve seen indicates what these may be. I treat the Hivers as somewhat
akin to Larry Niven\'s Puppeteer\'s, and the manuals say that the
Hivers are masters of psychohistorical manipulation.  Anyone who
could get a K\'Kree culture to eat meat would have to be. So I think
that the AO strategy could well be due to Hiver manipulation.  Also,
this is toward the \'Black Sphere\' which could well be the source of
significant danger to everyone, so it does make sense to move that
way.  After all the Aslan have to come through a lot of former
Solomani space (and former Solomani...who would not really welcome
very many ihatei in \'their\' territory) to get to the RC, and one would presume 
that they are
more interested in the Regency.

This also accounts for no great \'Push to Sol\' movement.  These were,
after all Imperial territories, though briefly in the Confederation
during the Rebellion.  I get the idea that it didn\'t really make much
difference at the time. Sol/Terra wasn\'t a very inviting target after
the Confederation and the Imperium were done fighting over it.

Remember, no one very much outside the AO knows anything about the
RC\'s existence, so there\'s probably no great push to their area.
Every other group is pretty much in the same position as the RC, just
poking around in their own little neighborhoods.


>VII.  Expansion Timetable Changes.

Part of my biggest problem with TNE is exactly this...everything\'s
happening waaaay too fast.  If you read some of the blurbs sprinkled
throughout the TNE manual, by 1250 or so the \'Star Vikings\' were just
memories that the revisionists were busy carving up into racists,
violent stereotypes.  You\'re right, Jim, none of this could possibly
have taken place so fast.  Exploration is a slow process, building an
infrastructure to have all the resources that the RC has (separate
Navy, fleets, etc) takes a lot longer than the 12 or so years that
have been given.


Finally, since Jim started this...I have a couple of ideas of my own
to throw out.

One of the worst contradictions in the books is trying to justify
the number of starships.  The whole thing starts out going on about
how the post-Virus era only had a precious few rickety, 70 year old
starships, then in the next paragraph talks about the dangers of
pirates. C\'mon...which is it?  If there are so damn few ships, piracy
is not an option...no on would risk getting their ship shot up for
the little trade goods that might be passing through. Where are the
pirates getting <their> ships, fer Chrissakes?

If the pirates are raiding defenseless coastal villages and selling
their stuff in more sophisticated markets a la the original Vikings,
it makes little more sense, because the economics don\'t hold
up...who do they sell stuff to?  what do they take in return?
Remember all the high tech manufacturing was wiped out.  Without
some sort of manufacturing base the pirates are limioted to trading
this high tech relic for that high tech relic, and become more of
the Fred Sanford of the spaceways rather than Blackbeard.

Remember, in the era of piracy here on Terra, most of it occurs
where there were large amounts of valulable resources going back and
forth (the Spanish Main, spice ships in the Indian ocean, etc.)

Most of my problems with TNE, like the piracy issue, stem from their
statements like \'Virus wiped everything out\', and \'the Wilds were a
blasted wasteland\'  No, it didn\'t, and they aren\'t.  Virus
only really kicked the Imperium when it was down. The thing that
wiped the Imperiium out was the general galaxy wide depression that
ensued from the horrendous resource consumption of the rebellion, and
the generalized destruction that emanated from it.  If you got your
starport bombed out, and couldn\'t pay for the ever more costly stuff
to fix it, because your main market for your superwidgets can pay for
them because their mnarket dried up, and you can\'t get them there
anyway, because of the pirates...well, your planetary economy dries
up and blows away.

I see the Imperium in it\'s latter days, with these vaccuum worlds
with 3 billion inhabitants, as more of a collection of \'company
towns\' than individual self-supporting planets.  When the company
goes, so does the town, in quick order, no Virus needed. The
remaining inhabitants turn to subsistence living, and scratch their
way through somehow.

What this does is make the Wilds less dangerous, and less lucrative
than before, and forces the strategy of the players to go out and
find those places that still do support some trade, which means wide
ranging exploration, and a lot less smash and grab.

Actually, I think this is a very good explanation.  There are
plenty of Real World examples of empires which had (from our perspective)
unusually low rates of technical innovation.  The most blatant is
probably the Chinese.  They had ocean-going vessels, the printing-press,
and gun powder long before the Europeans, and yet it was the Europeans
who showed up on Chinese shores with guns and printed books.  I am not a
China scholar, but a friend of mine who has lived there claims that
Chinese ships began their own age of exploration, IIRC, about 200 years
before the European one, but that the emperor called it off, because
China was considered the center of the world, and he thought nothing
useful could be learned outside it.  The other explanation was that the
empire was already so big and the bureaucracy necessary to run it so
cumbersome, that further expansion threatened central control.  Similar
arguments have been made about the discouragement of technical progress.
>From what little I know about Trav history, the 1st Empire and the Vilani
can be considered Chinese for these purposes
Another ancient empire, the Romans, has a reputation for being
very technically accomplished.  But they also failed to make some very
basic technical advances which probably hobbled their ultimate success.
Remember that the saddle had to be introduced from China.  Also, the
Romans used yokes on their draft horses which work great on oxen, but
press uncomfortably on the throat of horses and holds them to walking
speed.  This has been offered as one reason why Roman roads werent more
used for internal commerce.  There was a Scientific American article a
few years back saying that in what is now southern France, the Romans had
begun to build primitive factories, but that the limitations of Roman
ground transport made trade outside of the immediate area very difficult
and the idea never took off.
 The Solomani Empires could be considered
rather Roman, in that they aggressively applied the knowledge they had,
but didn\'t  seem particularly interested in seeking new knowledge.
Please don\'t make too much of these comparisons.  IIm just trying
to point out that there are historical precedents for big empires being
poor at advancing technical and scientific frontiers.  One could argue
that the Solomani had their hands full assimilating all those inhabited
worlds and that the returns to this activity exceeded the returns to
rapid technical progress.

We decided to do the same on the beta list... it makes PAWs more useful

I assume you mean that they have not used the fuel in their drop tanks for

eg. the Gazelle: it operates at j-4 if the fuel in the tanks is used AND the

have to jump in at about j-2.

Sound correct?

I thought Norris\' speech in 1125 (or whenever - after Arrival Vengance, anyway)
stated clearly, "I must myself admit, there is no Emperor". I don\'t know if the
reason above gels with the new attitude of the Regency.

Perhaps a better explanation could be found as to why the planet is still
interdicted:
- machinations by Tukera (I never liked them anyway, they are the "bad boys" in
my campaign, wouldn\'t trust them as far as I could throw one of their liners);
- the place has simply been overlooked due to other, more pressing problems
(although this probably won\'t wash, considering the Governor\'s efforts);
- can people suggest some other reasons?

I would simply figure the volume, based upon surface area and hull
thickness, of the drive plunge, and then figure the amount of armor
absolutely required for spaceworthiness, and use that thickness on the
amount of SA of the drive plunge. Figure which hit locs are at the reduced
armor value, based upon the process for Surface hit tables. Vehicles do it,
so why not ships?

Radiators and thruster vents should still have a minimum av=1 per G or per
Atm. (Probably a little thin, but who\'s really nitpicking?).

I wouldn\'t have the drive give any protection, as the exhausts will be much
smaller than would be needed, especially at the speeds needed to make
HEPlaR work.

But I also understand that at least Aubaine has a working ship yard and that
Aurora is cabable of repairing star ships. Other RC star ports might have
ship yards than can construct SDBs. Does the rules book say something about
construction time? Otherwise I suggest a construction time of about 1 Week
per 5 MCr ship price, perhaps depending on TL of the ship yard.

Also, each week a S&M team will home stolen or found ships, stranded by
virus, destroyed in the final war, abandoned by the crew that could be
repaired and sold at Auction.

Finally I bed that a relative wealthy region like the RC will attract
spacefaring people (Fartrader, Guilds captains, Virus ships, exploration
vessels from other pocket empires, and so on) from all about the bordering
sectors.

Why do you think that piracy means stealing goods? A starship is worth about
30-40 MCr, no ship can transport goods worth more than the transport ship\'s
price. Of course pirates should hijack starships. The misrelation between
cargo price and ship price is IMHO the real contradiction.

Well, I think you mix up here caribian pirates and Skandinavian vikings.

Pirates were attracted by south american gold, they entered ships, captured
goods, people and ships for their own wealth or for their country (as for
example Francis Drake did). They were thief, thugs, sailors how sold most of
their loot.

Vikings on the other hand, were trader, warriors and explorers. They often
robed for their own use. Among their motives are feelings of more strength,
true belief (that\'s because they liked to rob these wimpsy Christian
beliefers. It shows their own goods greater strength), real worth of
ownership. They laught at their enemies, Frankish knights or Irish monastries.

Slaves, Human work or Information for example.

I understand this statement as the first idea of the Dawn League this has
proven false by their first expedition. Now it\'s to re-explore the
not-so-empty wilds and contact the not-so-rare pockets of remained civilisation.

TED\'s are another point of misinformation. I think, it\'s the ignorance of
the RC to call every other government as TED and it\'s a comfortable excuse
why to steal their technology.

What, of course IMHO, is much better than stupid S&G combat missions.


Someone raised the idea of a Rimward exploration mission to contact Terra or
other remains of the Solomani Confederation. I think, that expedition would
be a great campaign setting and a great chance to contribute to TNE without
the fear of contradicting GDW\'s \'holy plan\' of what\'s the only true story
that has to be written ;-)

Let\'s take one of this newly repaired ships from Auction on Aurora, a 400t
merchant, refitted with a recovered Jump-3 engine and two laser and missile
turrets, called \'The Memory of Trees.\' Plan some useful flight routes based
on the old available star maps and then let\'s imaginem what could happen to
the \'Memory of Trees\' one their two year mission to find other survived
civilisations.

This is captain Eibedo Oleido [EYEbedow olEYEdow],
owner of the Memory of Trees.

[The last skill is his occupation with his own spiritual balance, a skill
special for Spiri and their special kind of religion.]

Oleido is born on Spires 1176. Because of his intelligence, education and
strong wish to \'feel the stars\' he managed to visit the second class of the
Hiver Technical Academy 1194 and then got enlisted to the RCN where he made
an astonishing career. After two special operations he leaves 1205 RCN with
the rank of a Lieutenant. He already owns an old merchant starship called
\'The Memory of Trees.\' Originally planing to work as free trader for the
Kruyter corporation (he already signed the contract), the RCES came to him
with the plan to do a rimward exploration in exchange for a new recovered
jump-3 engine. He agreed.

Oleido is a peaceful man, carefully thinking man. Other people might call
him a slow thinker, but he need to reason a matter from all sides first
before he take a decission. He hates cruelity, loud words, and toughtless
actions. He\'s good in following long or difficult plans and will neither
give up nor stop it. He really beliefs in success and seems to force it. No
RCN officer ever managed to force Oleido to cut his long brown hair or
remove the typical Spirish headband.

For me, the book looks more like an instruction and example how to play a
Traveller RC campaign than a real story. Protagonists are more types of
characters than real persons. Perhaps the use of only call signs instead of
real names, the emotionless military behavior (I would call this typical
Prussian) and overwhelming use of direct speech that has no room for
thoughts, emotions or longer descriptions gives me that idea. I guess the
language used by RCES and RCN is derived from US military customs. Very
interesting. I always imagined RCES (and Imperial Scouts) as less formal
organizations whose members talk more like \'real humans\' :-)

However, I liked the story line. Good enough that I ordered the second book.
It gave an example how an adventure could look like. And probably, that was
the overall intent of the book! I nice sightseeing tour corewards of the RC.

book. It looks like the author wasn\'t allowed to be creative. (As a side
note, I was amused  about the strange Vilani-German dialect of the Meadsk,
very nice ;-)

What\'s the book about? A RCES team led by a survived feminine Imperial scout
called Read Sun break a Guild conspiracy against the Hiver race.

Actually, it can. Please realize that copyright infringement criteria
includes an adverse economic impact component. That is, adverse to GDW\'s
financial interests. It couldn\'t hurt to get their permission first, and it
might save unnecessary hard feelings (or worse) later on.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Copyright infringement includes a bit more than just economic impact cri-
teria. Precedent also figures largely. Besides, from the posts I\'ve seen
from GDW to this list, they\'ve made it pretty clear, IMO, that they won\'t
be giving permission for anything.

Do you realize that *every* sub-sector of UWP data that\'s been published
by GDW has been made avail. over the \'Net *except* for the data in the RSB?
Sounds to me as though ample precedent has been set.

Somewhat facetiously I would say.  _Any_ is a pretty broad term after
all.  What is the Jump drive except a receiverless teleportation
device?  Sure it has limitations that anyone could point out.

Takes a week.
Cannot jump in within the 100 diameter limit.
Debatably has an indeterminate vector on exit.

However to say that Jump Gate technology without a receiver will allow
you to steal missiles from their racks and drop hydrogen bombs on the
bridge of enemy warships is a big leap.

After all the Zhodanians supposedly have/had teleportation commandoes
and the Imperium still exists . . . . . (sort of)

If you want to talk about teleportation you need to look at the
Traveller universe as it exists/existed and see how teleportation could
fit in.  If some mechanism makes for an unstoppable war machine, then
you have to invent some reason why that cannot work.

Maybe the Tukeras finally bought out or chased off all the people that they
sold out to, and own the entire planet free and clear again.  Then it would
be the private property of the Tukera family again, and they could retain
the Interdiction to keep the paparazzi out.

This brings up the Andor-and-Candory situation again.  You know, the Tukeras
have a special waiver from the Emperor that lets them come and go from Lewis
as they please, so there\'s no reason why the Droyne can\'t have a similar
dispensation to protect the privacy of Andor and Candory, yet still come
and go as they please.  Maybe they needed protection from outsiders coming
in and stealing their religiously-significant artifacts of the Ancient era.

Actually, the arguments for the way sector and subsector boundaries
are laid out make sense.  The Imperial surveys and astrogational
charts laid out their baseline from Reference/Cadion (Core 0140).
(According to CT\'s Library Data books.)  They use a ring/ray system
to mark coordinates, radiating from the galactic center.  (In the
game, we ignore this and just use the hex numbers.)  But Reference
is an red dwarf sitting in the lower-left hand corner of the Core
sector.  It\'s my guess that horizontal sector borders may roughly
follow galactic rings and vertical sector borders follow galactic
rays.  Charted space is small enough that I don\'t think the curve
or deviation of the lines should be terribly noticable except at
the very edges of Charted Space.

Since all the old surveys would still use this notation, and the
RC may agree that Reference is a handy baseline, there isn\'t much
reason to change mapping systems.  Besides, sector and subsector
maps in a scale of 8:10 are very easy to draw on a piece of paper
that probably has the same length to width ratio.

you of an e-mail message I recently sent to the president of FASA Corporation.

Basically, my message suggested that FASA should solicit GDW for the right to
purchase the Traveller line from them.  GDW has fallen on such difficult
financial times that it appears the company may soon shut down.  Now, I know the
death knell has been sounded for GDW before, and they\'ve somehow managed to
remain in business to this point, but indications are that they are now in worse
shape than they\'ve ever been.  With apologies to Mark Twain, I don\'t think the
reports of GDW\'s demise are greatly exaggerated.

As a diehard fan of Traveller, I thought it prudent to at least do something to
try and save the game.  I\'ve played this game for 15 years and have enjoyed each
and every incarnation of it.  It\'d be a shame to see that all go away when
there\'s still strong market interest in the game and high potential for
Traveller products to have continued financial success.  So I composed this
e-mail message and sent it to the company I thought would best assume the
Traveller mantle.

If you agree with me, please join me in e-mailing FASA at fasalou@aol.com, the
address I was given by the company receptionist.  If you do not, your
comments/criticism are welcome.

===============================================================================



Dear FASA:

As a longtime player of roleplaying games, and occasional watcher of RPG market
activity, I\'d like to make a suggestion to FASA.

Though I\'ve played AD&D, Shadowrun, Gamma World, Star Frontiers and Star Trek
over the years, the game that has more consistently held my attention is GDW\'s
Traveller.  The game\'s rich background history and abundant source material has
made it very accessible to me and many other players.  Traveller is arguably the
best far-future science fiction roleplaying game on the market, and has been
since its inception in 1977.

However, Traveller\'s parent company, GDW, has fallen on lean times and has begun
to show signs that the end is near.  The current incarnation of Traveller, "The
New Era," has not been a hot seller for a number of reasons, but the reason I\'m
most concerned about is GDW\'s inability to put out Traveller products on a
consistent, timely basis.

In recent weeks, GDW has seen the departure of two of the driving forces behind
Traveller:  Dave Nilsen and Loren Wiseman, the former being the driving force
behind the New Era and the latter being the game\'s perennial creative guru.
While the two remain with GDW on a consulting basis, they are no longer
permanent employees.  Personnel cuts have been made in other areas as well,
which brings into question the company\'s continued ability to maintain adequate
product support or to pay creative talent.

Now, why in the heck am I writing FASA about a game from another company?  The
answer is simple.  I and many others in the gaming community would love to see
FASA buy out the Traveller line from GDW and do it justice.  FASA\'s products are
recognized industrywide as some of the highest quality gaming materials
available.  You release products on time and with more than adequate quality and
selection to satisfy the market.  With the loss of the Star Trek license,
Traveller would make an excellent fit with your considerable line of games.
Furthermore, FASA developed licensed Traveller products in its infancy, and
therefore has some experience with the game.

I believe that FASA\'s ability to advertise Traveller products properly coupled
with the game\'s market recognition would result in a profitable venture for your
company.  All the tools are there.  All the game needs is the right company to
take it back up to the level where it should be.

Though this all hinges on your current ability and inclination to make such a
purchase and GDW\'s willingness to sell Traveller, I couldn\'t keep silent about
this any longer.  I\'d hate to see a game as excellent as Traveller go to its
grave.  Instead, I and multitudes of other loyal Traveller players, would love
to see it resurrected under the guidance of a company who can make the game what
it should be.  I can think of no other company that could accomplish this as
well as FASA.

Sincerely,

Christopher Griffen

        It\'s been a while since I\'ve played Traveller, and all my books are
back home, but I decided to offer a few ideas about the drop tank thing.
        I guess it might be obvious that drop tanks should be either very
disposable or very retrievable.  Very disposable might be a little
difficult, but something like a flexible material that balloons out and
hardens (but doesn\'t break) when filled with liquid hydrogen might be nice.
Ideally, something that balloons out but doesn\'t harden would be best, but
that sounds unlikely.  I\'m not real familiar with what exactly happens to
clothes and plastics and rubber materials when they get that cold, but if
you\'re in space and can prevent anything from hitting the tanks (?) it
might be ok.  Just an idea.
        Very retrievable is much easier.  Somebody recommended an idea like
this a few days ago.  Put on the tank a computer and reaction drive which
are big enough and smart enough to find the planet with the space port and
push the tank into a course for orbit with that planet.  Or you could
probably tell it to place itself in one of the Trojan points for easy mass
retrieval if you wanted to.  The main thing is patience.  If you don\'t mind
waiting about 20 years or so for the initial return on your drop tanks
(after which you would then have a constant return of drop tanks), then you
don\'t have to put much gas in the drop tank to send it back home.
Retrieval would be very easy and gauranteed (except for the occasional
dumby computer), as you could expect all the drop tanks to show up at the
same place.  Make them come to you.

My impression has always been that all forms of irregular armour is fine:
you should be able to juggle armour around the 20 hull sections, and also
modify armour at  specific surface location PROVIDED you can identify hits
which impact that location.  Armoured things have always been built that way.

The problems comes in moving the design to BR, which uses the a single
armour factor: you could probably do fine with a weighted mean armour value
based on the percentage of surface area at each thickness.

I was disappointed by the fact that the use of internal armour which is
allowed in FF&S is not well refelcted in the BR rules: I had always thought
that the WWI "Protected Cruiser" was an interesting idea.

Looking at starship computers and the Vampires sourcebook, are Traveller
computers still primitive?  I thought they were pretty powerful, as TL 17
computers were effectively sentient, even pre-Virus.

Also note that even the rough drafts of the Regency had copywrite notices.

That\'s a smart idea: I\'ll be doing so.  The payment should be enough to

I am at Mt Wilson Observatory in Calif, so I have plenty
of time to kill, so I thought I would write up some ideas I have
had for a few weeks.
I was reading Vilani and Vargr, and I realized that the longevity of
of Vland would give the Vland region of space a boost over the rest
of space.  Pure breed Vilan can easily live to be over a 100 years
of age.  In 1200 there should still be significant numbers of
Imperial Vilani living on planets in the Vland sector and what
ever subsector it is located in.  Path of Tears, At least I think
it was Path of Tears, mentioned that Survivors from the Imperial
age were quite useful in finding existing caches of high technology
 possessing lost knowldedge and other things to help rebuild
civilization.  Also there is the presence of Vland itself.
Others on the TML have suggested that the Terrans would have an
easier time rebuilding because they had developed many technologies
from scratch, and would have examples of older technologies just
lying arond in museums.  THe same would be true of Vland.
This area is also intersting, because it will be the first
interesting area that the expanding Regency explores.  Corridor
was blasted by the Civil War and the Virus would have chewed it up
too.  But maybe, there are alot of vargr in Corridor and the RSB
suggests Vargr culture is capable of adapting to to the virus better
than Humans.   Anyway Vland will be one of the first sectors
to be explored by the Regency.
 What do you think?

Quoting from RSB pg 76:
Entry on Alkhailikoi, Caranda Aledon:  "With the uniting of the Aledon and 
Alkhalikoi lines,
the Aledon line will again be instrumental in placing an Alkhlikoi on the throne
of a restored Imperium. "
That sounds to me as if most people planning on once again having an Emperor,
as soon as there is an empire to govern.  Calling the Domain of Deneb the
Regency implies that it is holding the crown until the rightful heir to the
throne claims it.


Another thing I curious about is what is the status of the surrounding sectors.
What is happening in Far Frontiers and the sector on the other side of that
is it Foreven.  No wait I think I have those two confused, Foreven is
spinward of Spinward Marches, and Far Frontiers is spinward of Foreven.
I think Far Frontiers was being done up in Traveller Chronicle, did
they publish any library data, or other wise talk about what is happening
in the sector, all I saw was subsector maps, but I am missing several issues.

I was thinking that this would be a good place for companies
to expand into, in order to replace markets lost to the collapse
of the empire.   How much of a presence did Imperial companies
have in these sectors?  Have the states in this area signed the anti-Virus
accords (the name escapes me).
I have the first and only issue of Imperialines where they give a map of
Foreven, and give names to the Interstellar governemtn, has anyone
done any work on these governments.  I know there is little if any
official work done on the area, since it was a player reserve area.
I\'ll think about this over the next few days.
Sorry about if this message rambled, but I am a bit tired, and
the seeing really sucks.

When military ships use drop tanks to jump to hostile system, they
arrive to their destination with their fuel tanks FULL. So here are some
benefits:

1. They are no need to refuel them using tankers or gas giant before any
action.
2. They can immediately jump away if enemy fleet is too strong.
3. They have much more g-turns (using jump fuel), if they choose to
fight.

So I can\'t see why military ships jump to enemy system without using
drop tanks if those are available.

Jyrki Paajanen
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Also, under High Guard rules jump fuel takes a horrendous amount of
displacement, 10% per jump #. As it turns out, under the design rules,
very large ships have to sacrifice armament if they devote 40% of their
disp. to j-fuel. If they only devote 30% then they can max out. See the
Tigress & Kokkirakk class in the old CT Fighting Ships supplement for
examples. Both only carry enough j-fuel for J3 but both have J4 engines
installed.

I am knocking up a set of utilities for Traveller, and am now ready to
unleash them on an unsuspecting universe.  The toolbox is a set of
command-line programs that read / modify the standard UWP sector files
available on the Traveller FTP archives.  Version 0.9 contains:

Sector Mapper - map sector by allegiance, population or tech level
Subsector Mapper
Hard Times    - apply the effects of the Rebellion and Hard Times on UWP data
Collapse      - sic Virus onto the UWP data

Future versions will add:

additional sector and subsector mapping options (e.g by population, trade codes)
sector generation - original, custom and Alternate (as described by Jeff
Zeitlin et al.)

They\'re no doubt buggy as hell, and are definately studies in how _not_ to
program using Turbo Pascal, but if anyone wants a copy, send me an e-mail
and they can have the lot...all I ask is that they send me word of any bugs,
gripes or suggestions.  V0.9 will be ready by the 8th December (trust me!)

I have only begun reading the TD list, so this tale of doom and disaster
comes as a bit of a surprise to me.

I know that Loren Wiseman and Dave Nilsen are leaving/cutting back, but
is this the complete disaster that Christopher is suggesting ? GDW &
Traveller survived the loss of Mark Miller, the end of DGP\'s love
affair, the apparent split between GDW and Charles Gannon and lots more.
Why should the loss of Loren Wiseman (and to a much lesser extent Dave
Nilsen) mean the end of the road ?

Christopher suggests other difficulties (perhaps relics of the
disastrous DJ escapade ?). Can anyone elucidate ?

That said, FASA were there nearly at the beginning. If Traveller had to
find a new home the Freedonian Aeronautics and Space Administration
would be the most appropriate place to go.

I haven\'t emailed FASA as yet; are things really that bad ?

case of a missjump, there are low berth for all passengers and the complete
crew. The fuel tank contains enough fuel for a 4 parsec jump and an 1 parsec
emergency jump. The ship is heavily armed and has 20 hands security forces
on board.

The ships looks like a big version of the old mercenary cruiser. There are
nine decks. Counting from engines, the lower decks 1-4 hold drives, power
plant and most fuel. The fifth deck contains crew staterooms, hangar and
cargo. Deck 6-8 are the passenger decks, deck 9 contains the bridge.

If this thing even has just a 30,000km AEMS, the price more than doubles
(the AEMS SR1 being MCr10).

So if the usual is an AEMS of some sort, a PEMS, and maybe a LADAR as a
backup (they\'re rather cheap, too), I\'d say this ship would run more
like 15-20MCr.

I\'d make a set of values for your "the usual" sensors so you can nail
the costs down a little better.  Also, since you made warships, too,
you\'ll need all the mass info to calculate the hits they\'ll take (unless
you pop \'em straight to BR).

Cool deck plans, never been much good at ascii myself :-)

Description
  The colossus class fast troop transport looks like a big U, using the room
between the U-legs to dock the 22 small crafts aboard. The airlocks allow
the simulataneous launch of 50 G-carrier (carrying 600 troops) or grav
tanks. Two TL15 hospitals allow fast medical care and can help to relive the
cold sleep effects. The power plants allow an acceleration of up to 3G.
Including jump fuel the colossus class ship has an endurance of 30 G-hours.
Armament is plentiful, sensors are long ranging, the costs for the ship are
astromomenous :-)
  I guessed the size of maintenance crew based on the power plants. I didn\'t
bother with designed exact armament and sensors. I ignored the fact that the
rules demand 300 medical hands for the 6000 low berth and declare this as
passengers problem. I\'ve included enough medi-techs to awake 300 military
medics.

The PEMS you put on has to be a folding array.  That means that this
fighter cannot evade and keep a lock-on at the same time.  If you choose
to do this, then a LADAR would be a good idea.  The active sensor isn\'t
good for anything, ditch it, or give it a useful range.

Any cheap fighter would do well to have missiles.

The component list doesn\'t tell us anything.  It needs to list hits.

        The (snipped) portion doesn\'t sound good at all. I can\'t comment

    'topic' => 'GDW and the Future',
    'body' => 'Greetings all,

   I have attempted over the last week or so to keep you up to date
regarding the personnel changes at GDW so that you will be better
informed about what\'s going on behind the scenes.  I have also done
some research regarding GDW\'s financial situation, that being a rather
hot topic of discussion lately.  Being a research librarian as its
advantages, one of them having a wealth of business related information
resources at your disposal.

   Let me say from the outset that I am not ``GDW bashing``.  If anything,
I am trying to clarify a few things, something that probably Loren should
be doing, but isn\'t.  Yes, I know he has his reasons for not stepping in at
some point and explaining why this or that is going on, but the problem is
that sometimes the less you talk about something, the bigger the PR
monster it becomes.  As an interested party, I felt that somebody should
come forward with relevant information.

   For the record:  Yes, sales are slow at GDW, but they are not planning
on shutting down anytime soon.  That is to say, they plan on being
around for a while, and are not in the process of emptying the last
of the cash out of their wallets so that they can pay the light bill.

   For the last year that records were available, 1994, GDW\'s sales
were estimated to be $910,000 (all these figures are in American dollars
BTW).  That compares to sales figures in 1991 of $1.13 million, and sales
figures for 1989 of $1.33 million.  Between 1989 and 1995, there has
been a 31.6 percent decline in sales according to these numbers.
Design and manufacture of recreational games makes up 95 percent of
their business, magazines (this includes Challenge) 5 percent.  While
sales figures are down, the numbers for 1989 and 1991 indicate a trend
toward reducing the amount of liabilities owned by the company.
The debt to asset ratio in 1989 was 1.71, in 1991 it was 2.62.  There
are no figures available for later dates.  Also, in case you were
interested, 20 percent of GDW\'s sales are to locations outside the US.

   There are currently 14 employees at GDW.  This compares to 32 in
1990.  Frank Chadwick is listed as the president, Paul R. Banner as
vice-president, Loren Wiseman as secretary, Marc Miller as treasurer,
and Susan Schud as officer manager.  I know Frank is still with the
company, and I believe Susan is as well.  Loren is now part-time (and
has been for the last year), though he may still have the title of
secretary.  I don\'t know what the status of Marc and Paul are.  I\'ve
told you the rest of the staff news in prior posts.

   Back in 1993, GDW was sued by Pepco Litho of Cedar Rapids, Iowa
for non-payment of a debt of $1,339.  Since then there have been no
similar suits filed.  The best known piece of litigation involving GDW
was the suit filed by TSR, which resulted in the death of the ``Dangerous
Journeys`` game.  There are no figures available for how much money
GDW may have lost because of this action, though TSR did agree to buy
out all stocks of Dangerous Journeys product that GDW had as part of
the settlement.  Informed *speculation* (and that\'s pretty much all it is
until someone at GDW fesses up) is that GDW lost a great deal of money
in legal fees as a result of the TSR lawsuit.

   I checked two sources for information on GDW\'s credit status:  TRW
and Dun & Bradstreet.  So far as I have been able to determine, they
are not behind at this time on paying bills to their commercial vendors.
There is a record of a few slow pays on invoices, but nothing that
involves large dollar amounts.  What the reports did not reflect, however,
is the slowness of payments to a number of freelance writers, some of
which have been waiting up to three years for amounts varying from
less than a hundred dollars to over $3,000.  No explanation has been
given (thus far) for this.

   Analysis:  Frank seems to have taken the company in for a soft
landing, downsizing the business in the face of declining sales.
Industry-wide, RPGs have been in a state of decline, regardless of
genre.  This can be attributed to the increase in popularity of other
game types (collectable card games, computer games, etc.) and to the
dramatic increase in the cost of paper (which the last I heard was up
about 350-400 percent over what it was a couple of years ago).  While
the RPG industry shows no signs of coming to an end, the market will
continue to be an intensely competitive one as companies struggle to
lower their overhead and produce products that bring in new customers
as well as retain current ones.  GDW seems to have positioned itself
over the last few years to concentrate it efforts on its core games,
namely Traveller, Twilight: 2000 (and its variants), and Command
Decision (and its many variants).  While this will allow them to release
material such as ``Armor 21`` (a T: 2000 variant), and perhaps even
2300 AD (as a Traveller variant), I wouldn\'t look for them to produce any
totally new games any time soon.

   Bottom line:  GDW is probably not in any kind of serious financial
trouble, but they are definitely smaller than they once were.  In the
near future they need to address the freelancer payment issue, and
consider starting up a web site.  I\'m sure they could find people willing
to volunteer their time and equipment (if necessary) for this purpose if
they were to only ask.

   Loren (if you are listening), if you feel that any of the above
information is in error, please feel free to correct it.  The purpose of
this post is to clear the air, not muck it up.

Regards,

Harold

    'body' => 'Moving 3 regiments of troops at one time seems like a large amount, but for
the old imperium, this was probably more the standard than the strange.

First of all, allow 42m^3 3 tons for each troop.  This will allow for
personal space (not much) galleys, training areas, storage for food weapons,
gear, etc.  Each troop would get a bunk in a bunkroom with about 3m^3 of
cubage. 1m^3 for personall effects.  The rest of the 39m^3 would be needed
for all of the other space required for formations etc.

You will need LOTS of space for vehicles, 200+% of volume.  The reason for
this is that mechanics will need to service the vehicles between missions.
The crews will need room to work on them also.  Then you will have to have
cubage for spare parts etc.  As for Air/Rafts, use G-carriers instead at
least, more likely TL-15 APCs.  Same space requirements as Tanks.

Don\'t forget the support troops.  For each grav Tank or APC. you will need
to have mechanics to work on the vehicles.  One thing traveller doesn\'t
always do well is spell out maintenance costs.  You will need about 2-4
techs for each vehicle.  There is also the other areas of support such as
JAG, IG, personell, medical, etc.

Now as for the orbital bombardment, (I would recommend using other ships),
but it would be hard to beat a meson weapon.

For delivery, I would probably use a small number of Jump Drops.  You can
also Deploy some of the Grav Tanks in this manner.  These troops secure a
landing zone.  Then you use something like Fury Assault Landers to get more
Infantry into place.  Then finally you use large shuttles to deliver 10-12
Grav Tanks at a time.  Probably just to high altitude then let them fly
down.  Artillery and logistics will need 400-1000 ton shuttles to get their
equipment down.  This lends itself to an interesting question, what about
using the same method for cargo (e.g.) shuttle it to low orbit/high altitude
then let it drop slowed by Contra-Grav then chutes for the final delivery.

I would also recommend organic elements of interface fighters at least 1
squadrons.  You might also include bombers.

As you can see the forces needed to deliver this size of unit is staggering.
We are talking about a 50-100Kton ship here.  I would not worry about too
much offensive weaponry, or high maneuver.  The key here would be for the
ship to be protected by the cruisers and escorts.  Just have point defense
and some stuff for figthers or a small escort or SDB.

On a more pratical note, perhaps a better solution would be to deliver
perhaps 1-3 battalions at a time.  We are talking about 1000 combat troops
and another 1000-1500 support troops.  The combat troops would be delivered
in two manners.  First the jump troops to secure a LZ, then the smaller
(2500 ton) transports would land directly and disgorge their 1-3 battalions
of troops.  Later after a beachead is established, the support troops come
in on Shuttles (100-500 ton) with cargo etc.

Oh well, sorry to ramble.  Hope this sparks some interest.

If your debt/asset ratios are correct, GDW is _increasing_ its liabilities
(or reducing equity).

Unfortunately the Vilani have a cultural problem with this. Since Vilani
society is structured so that inventors get little credit and people learn
tasks by rote rather than from first principles, (IMHO) it would take longer
for lost technology to be recovered. This also leads to problems when things
break down, as without the knowledge-based diagnostic systems to aid in the
repair of advanced technologies, the rate of collapse could be greater than
that on Terra.

Well, I\'m sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but I understand that FASA
are currently dealing with some legal problems concerning their BATTLETECH
licence. Given the state of the US legal system, they\'ll be protecting any
free cash they have just in case they have to go to court. Because of this,
I don\'t imagine there\'ll be any help from that quarter - even if it\'s
required.

Your only hope (if Harold Hale does prove to be wrong), is possibly to
arrange a Secret Service raid on GDW [well it worked for Steve Jackson!]*. ;-)

Personally, I think we should be considering what we can offer to do to help
Frank and the others at GDW (assuming they even want our help!), rather than
picking over the corpse before it has even stopped breathing!

Ahh - other way around. This does make more sense, after thinking about it.
However, does the Gazelle work?

HG stats:
81t fuel internal, 100t in drop tanks

HG calculations:
J-1 Fuel = 10% * tonnage
PP Fuel = 1% * tonnage * pp-number(7)

Results Table:
                                  Tot Fuel  PP Fuel   Jump Fuel         Excess
300t, no tanks, no extra fuel     81t       21t       60t  @ 30t = j2   0
300t, tanks used and dropped      181t      21t       160t @ 30t = j5   10t
300t, tanks ONLY used & dropped   181t      21t       100t @ 30t = j3   70t
400t, with tanks, all fuel used   181t      21t*      160t @ 40t = j4   0
400t, with tanks, int fuel used   81t       21t*      40t  @ 40t = j1   120t
400t, with tanks, int fuel used#  81t+      tanks     80t  @ 40t = j2   101

~this is what was described by Jyrki. It can only jump out at j2, with
minimal pp fuel.
*in theory this should be 28t. Actually this is a slight cheat.
#assumes pp fuel is drawn from tanks, probably fuel in tanks is pumped back inside
during jump. This gives a small margin for error, as 21t is required (if you still
use the cheat calculation) for the pp and 80t for the return jump. If the tanks
are shot off, this could be a problem.

Can anyone do the same for the TNE version?

Yes, I missed that throw-away line. The idea is that the Regency is just a
temporary measure between imperia, and Norris-Seldrian-Caranda are Regents in
the same way as Arbellatra was, before she ascended the throne as Empress.

3.MEGATRAVELLER ALIENS

"Vilani and Vargr" and "Solomani and Aslan" were part of a series by DGP to
flesh out alien races for MT. There were going to be two more, one about the
Zhos and Droyne (the Psionic Races) and the other about K\'kree and Hivers
(the Weird Ones), but these were shelved when DGP stopped producing material.
I originally paid the exhobitant price of Au$26.95 for "Rats and Cats"
(approx. US$19) but remember this was the airmail price.

4.      FASA

FASA would not have been my first choice - DGP are still out there, somewhere.
Thank you, Harold, for clearing up a few things though. GDW sounds as though
they\'ll be there for a while longer - but I agree with your suggestions re
paying freelancers and creating a Web page. Maybe HIWG could get permission
for one - or possibly The Traveller Chronicle (who already have the "approved
by GDW" sticker)?

   That would be true if the ratio were negative.  Here are the numbers
from which it was derived:

                                          1989                         1991

Current Liabilities ($)       215,444                     141,951

   This shows that GDW increased slightly its assets and decreased
significantly its liabilities.  I wish I had more current data, but none was
available from D&B--it seems that GDW was unwilling to provide it.

Lewis Roberts writes:

   Absolutely.  Assuming that GDW doesn\'t have any major loans hanging
over its head, and they continued to reduce their liabilities as they did
back in 1991, they could continue to operate in this mode for some time
to come.

>So cheer up.

   There is no reason to be sad.  GDW hasn\'t gone anywhere yet,
nor should we assume that it is going to.  If anything will *absolutely*
kill GDW, it would be having the fans of its games conclude that the
company is done for and stop purchasing products.  If you like TNE,
Twilight: 2000, Command Decision, or any of GDW\'s other games, and
want GDW to continue to produce material for them,  the best thing you
can do  is to go out and buy a GDW product.  I for one recently put my
money where my mouth is, buying a few things that I had put off
purchasing for various reasons.

   And for those of you who support a FASA buy out of Traveller, I
recommend that you purchase TNE products now more than ever.  Why?
Quite simply, FASA is in the business of making money.  Do you
honestly expect them to buy a game that has no fan support?  In case
you were wondering, fan support in the gaming industry is measured
in unit sales, and FASA will show no interest in buying out a game title if
they can\'t be guaranteed to at least break even on the proposition.

I wrote up two NPCs from the RICE PAPER on Lewis and on Gerome.
Hope they are useful.

NPCS of the RICE Papers
Circa 1201

Governor Justin Muurgan
Muurgan  was elected Governor of Lewis, by the settlers that reside
there.  For  further information on the Governor\'s history see the RICE Paper 
on the planet Lewis.

Governor Muurgan is 105 years old.  Even though he is ancient, his body is in 
rather good condition.  He prides himself on walking two miles everyday.  He
  does this even when travelling on a starship.  This often annoys the crew, as 
he tends to like to stroll around engineering bays.  He has a closely cropped
  thinning white hair, and a very dark complexion.

The Governor is often travelling to meet with supporters, or to gather
more supporters.  He meets with  small groups of people, here and there.  He 
only addresses large crowds, on those worlds where the cause of Lewis is a
  popular one.  On these worlds he often attends fundraisers, and other gala 
events.  He is often invited to parties where he is a  minor celebrity.

The Governor is a driven by the idea of freedom for his people.  He will do 
almost anything to get them free.  He realizes that most of the
people who invite him to parties, or come  to his  speeches, are more 
interested  in his celebrity than his cause.   But if they donate money,  they 
help the
  cause, even if they don\'t believe in it as much as he does.

Commander Wafoua Syoisuis
  Cmmdr Syoisuis is the  Commander of the Squardon enforcing the
Red Zone around Gerome/Rhylanor.
Syouisuis is a Regency Aslan, his family has been  in the Marches for about 120 
 years, they were the survivors of a small clan that lost
a particularly vicious clan war.  As he is a  Regency Aslan, he acts fairly 
human.  He recognizes that different sexes  can preform the same job,  that
  humans have a sense of honor, though it is different than that of Aslans.  
Several True Aslan have challenged Syoisuis
to duels.  Syoisouis has won all of these, this has given him some measure of 
respect from True Aslan.
  Cmmdr  Syoisuis has had a illustrious career, at first being assigned to 
patrolling the Coreward border of the Aramis  Subsector.  As a Lieutenant he was
  instrumental in stopping a Vargr Corsair raid on Nasemin.  For this he 
received the first of his many commedations.
After several years he was transfered to the 23rd fleet. In 1191 he was given 
command of the 49th Squadron.  He hopes to make Admiral before he retires,
  which will  probably be in 10 years or so.
   Syoisuis is extremly loyal to the Regency, and the Regency Navy.  He will do 
what ever it takes to keep them safe.  He has no problem
covering up the mistakes that lead to the Red Zone on Gerome.  He has to deal 
with individuals who have attempted to break the Red Zone, he will deal with
  them harshly.  THe lightest sentence would be imprisonment on Exile/Deneb.

I always understood that debt/asset ratio implied that debt was *divided*

Dear Folks -

1.      DROP TANKS

Jyrki repied to my query:
>Can anyone explain the benefits to military ships?"
>>When military ships use drop tanks to jump to hostile system, they
>>arrive to their destination with their fuel tanks FULL. So here are some
>>benefits:

I assume you mean that they have not used the fuel in their drop tanks for
the jump?

eg. the Gazelle: it operates at j-4 if the fuel in the tanks is used AND the
tanks are retained. To retain the tanks and NOT use the fuel in them, it would
have to jump in at about j-2.

Sound correct?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^6

In CT the Gazelle was something of an exception. It was designed to jump
while retaining drop tanks. Most CT designs were not. If the Gazelle does
not use fuel from drop tanks it goes J-2 if the tanks are carried irregard-
less of their contents. If it uses fuel from the drop tanks & retains the
tanks it goes J-4. If it uses fuel from the tanks & drops them before jump
it goes J-6.

For an example of ships that weren\'t really designed to retain drop tanks
we can look at the CT Tigress. It only has enough internal tankage for J-3
but engines powerful enough for J-4. If it doesn\'t drop the tanks before
jump it still only goes J-3 & will not have quite enough fuel for J-1 when
it arrives. If it drops the tanks it can go J-4 & have to refuel before
jumping again or go J-2 & still have enough fuel for another J-2 when it
arrives.

BTW, I always figured that tankers were routinely assigned, along with
other support & escort ships, to Batrons & that these ships could provide
drop tanks. They might even hang around & collect them after the BB\'s
jump & then follow them a little later.

market. I was searching for the Next Gen and Marines supplements, and my
local game store put me on the phone with their distributor, who patiently
explained that fasa had just BOUGHT BACK all the STRPG stuff off the
distributor\'s shelves.<<

Maybe, but there are two sides to every coin.  I\'ve got it on good authority
that FASA may not\'ve been entirely at fault in the loss of the Star Trek
license.  I understand that it was frustrating for many players of the game, but
Paramount may have had ulterior motives in pulling the license.  Paramount\'s TNG
excuse might have been just the first thing they could find as a reason to pull
the license.  The jury\'s still out.  If we see a TSR Star Trek RPG in the
future, I think we\'ll have reason to believe that FASA wasn\'t entirely at fault.

>>If someone must buy Traveller, let it be a group of fans, or anyone BUT
=46ASA. West End would be excellent, and they are used to producing high
quality, low glitz, easy to use, fun to read supplements. And they deliver
fairly close to on time. Or maybe SJG, who produce some of the highest
quality materials around, even if they run as much as 7 years or more late
(like GURPS Mecha).<<

You\'re on target regarding quality, but let\'s talk business.  WEG already has
Star Wars.  There\'s no way they\'re going to dilute their line with another
sci-fi game.  They\'d be competing with themselves.

SJG:  Maybe.  But they\'d be more likely to take the Traveller background and
make it a GURPS sourcebook than actually continuing development along the lines
of the established Traveller rules.  Though this may not be an entirely bad
thing! <g>

Every military ship I design has MANDATORY drop tank fittings.
Very simple reason: when planning major operations, they
allow an entire fleet to arrive in the target system with
FULL jump fuel tanks. This allows the option of RETREAT if
things get too hot.  This also gives you a lot of extra
maneuver fuel if you don\'t need to retreat, but need to
do a lot of pursuits and so on.

NOTES
   No fuel purification machinery, 8,800,000 kl fuel.
   This ship was planned since 1070, when the high admirality decided that the IN needed
some prestigious ships. In 1078 Gashikuudaan Yards got the order to build 10 ships of the
new GALAXIA-class. During construction however problems arose by the sheer size of the ship
and public opinion turned against the enourmously expensive project. Lukin Gashikuudaan, owner
of Gashikuudaan Yards, died in 1081 of an old heart weakness, and his company staggered into
financial problems without its 130 year lasting leader. Construction came to a halt the same
year. In 1087 Core Starships offered to continue the project on its own risk. The admirality
accepted the offer, and construction continued in 1095 at CS orbital facility.
   With CS\'s 1000 year experience construction went on swiftly, and in 1099, just in time for
the centennial celebrations, the EMPEROR OF THE 8000 SUNS was finished. The name GALAXIA was
abandoned for various reasons, but kept as the class designation.
   Euphoria was high in navy circles, and never lowered since. The GALAXIA class is seen
as an example for modern naval architecture. 60,000 kl of recreational and excercisement area
make these ships very hospitable and friendly.
   Nontheless the GALAXIA-class is an almost invincible opponent. Its 200cm BSD armor makes
it almost invulnarable to all weapons except meson guns. Defense against those however is seen
as a major weakness in the GALAXIA\'s design. Many experts criticize the meson screen for being to
weak, to stand against typical meson fire from other battleships. Others argue, that any ship,
that was large enough to hold a meson gun of appropriate caliber would never come close enough due
to the 1000 Gj particle accelerator weapon that typically outranges all meson guns of its size and
the fierce, unstoppable power of the 1000 ton laser batteries.
   Furthermore, the GALAXIA can fire 400 large missles per round, for 8 rounds, each tipped
with four 500kt warheads. Next there are 100 heavy laser bays, that penetrate up to 402cm of BSD,
and finally 100 point defense laser turrets with a deadly ROF. Combined with a sensor-array
that won\'t let slip anything through its weave, many people wonder if there actually *is*
anything that could harm this ship even with its black globe down.

==================================================================================================

NOTES:
    As you might notice, the meson screen is really small. The problem with getting it
bigger was not power usage, but surface area. Jump drive and HEPlaR drive consume a lot
of it, and though the volume of this ship is immense, the surface is not. EMM radiators
would consume another 140,000 m^2, so I also had to leave them away. This makes this darn
thing a really big blotch on any AEMS operators cube (=radar operators screen:) and
vulnerable to the most feared spaceship weapon of tomorrow, too...(sigh)
   Next, I really don\'t know if the gunnery is enough for a ship that large. Sure, I could
well add another 100 LaserBays, but aren\'t the first hundred enough to handle with *any*
ship? A ship with an AV of 2000 will still suffer 155 damage points. This is still one critical
hit on a craft of up to 100,000 tons. Anything larger will be eaten up by the PA the same round
it appears on the screens/cubes. Those 1000ton laser batteries will do the rest in less
than one round... Critical hit on G sized targets up to an AV of 101,050 !!!
   Then, if something wanted to hurt this baby, it would have to pump incridible
11 Tj = 11,000 Gj = 11,000,000 Mj into the heat sinks first... I guess there are few ships
that could do something like it. However I would like to hear some comments from BR/BL players
on this topic, as I\'m not one myself ( no players...:( )
   Last but not least, after creating this monster I am looking for a way to stop it!
Planetary meson gun sites are a possibility, but what sort of fleet could stand long
against such an opponent?
   Last note: I included a self-destruct mechanism. Weight was figured out from the
TN-warhead table in FFS, but price determined as for the same volume of radioactive fuel.
A damper box was provided also. All I need now are rules for damage ...
   Any comments are welcome!!!

NOTES:

   This vessel was constructed in the early 970\'s as part of a Imperial Navy contest for a
fast and very offensive little rider on TL-14 basis. Delta Rhombus Yards\' contribution was
the GEPARD-Class rider. In the final jury decision it made the 8th place in the ranking
and Delta Rhombus settled into a financial crisis. Years later however many smaller systems
showed interest in the ship and in the following years the GEPARD found its way into many
system defense squadrons. Around 1000ti over 300 were (mostly under license) constructed
throughout the imperium. Since then it has gained a reputation as a formidable craft
against more lightly armed opponents, such as pirate vesseles typically are.
   The IMPERIAL SPACETECHNOLOGY OBSERVER has written the following about the GEPARD:
   "...a surprisingly agile craft. And once the engineer kicks the throttle open, few things
are more impressive than the 8 Geeeees that really hurt with only 5 of them compensated...
Usual tactics is the ship lies silent in the void, waiting for its prey. Once its formidable
passive sensor array has detected the foe, just a little burn, and the GEPARD closes in with
tremendous speed... The particle accelerator is a smashing hazard to all enemies within 2.3
light seconds. It maintains its punch up to 4 lsecs and does enough damage to render small
targets completely inoperable with 2 or 3 hits... All in all nothing you would like
to be against!"

3) Sandcasters vs. 50*TL Mj Limit
=================================

This is an older article, that was getting dusty on my HD since summer `95.
I recently rejoined the TML and found that the TL*50 limit was still used
by many, so I figured that I should mail it now, even if it`s a bit late:

Hi everybody!

   I`ve recently been skimming the big pile of e-mail I have amassed
in the past two weeks or so. While browsing through the TML, I found
that a large portion of those mails just dealt with one topic:
BigLasers(tm).

   While all sorts of arguments were given for or against a Mj-limit, I am
missing the creative part in this discussion.

   I agree with Cynthia, that introducing a TL limit like the proposed
50*TL limit would be a pretty abitrary decision, something that shouldn\'t
be done in a hard-sf game (IMHO). Many of you argued however, that allowing
big lasers would destroy the game balance. But does it really do?

   I actually wondered why noone has proposed defences against BigLasers(tm).
Sandcasters for example reduce a lasers _DAMAGE_-value by the given reduction.
Even monster lasers do have comparatively small DVs, so by pumping enough sand
into the air (err sorry... space that is), most ships should be able to
protect themselves against all sorts of laser fire by building walls of sand:)
This consequently leads to the development of Sandcaster Barbettes, Bays or
even Sandscreens!!!
   I find that using such game-world appropriate anti-measures is *much* better
than using abitrary limits.
   I shall however notice, that I`m not a particular frequent BL-gamer, and most
of the values were just made up to occupy a certain volume for complete
protection (so that installation of weapons and protection compete against each
other to make designing a more interesting thing-You`ll always need trade-offs in
real design sequences!).

   So here is my answer to Gj- and Tj-Lasers (see the GALAXIA-BBH):

SandScreens

Select the Reduction Value RV you wish to install. Field manipulation
hardware is then obtained by the following formula.


Volume:

     MHV = RV x TLM x SA

MHV: Volume of field manipulation hardware in m^3.
RV:  Reduction Value.
TLM: Tech-Level modifier from table below.
SA:  Surface Area in m^2.

Mass: Mass of sandscreens in metric tonnes equals volume in m^3.
Power: Power usage in Mw equals volume in m^3 x 0.05.
Price: Price in MCr equals RV x 0.15.

   Sandscreens need a sand storage to replace burned up sand. This is
proportional to the maximum number of damage value absorbed, not in one
shot but as a whole.
   The designer selects the total amount of damage value to be absorbed and
the type of sand to be used be the screen.
The table shows weight, volume and price per absorbed damage point.

 15  Enhanced Reactive      0.003

Explanation:
----
   Ablative: This sand is made to dissipate the beam by simply evaporating and
dispersing the beam in the process.
   Enhanced Ablative: This type of sand is an enhancement on ablative sand. The
material uses up more in chemical reactions and disperses the beam with slight
prismatic capabilities.
   Prismatic: As the same says, this sand disperses the beam by its prismatic
properties while offering as little as possible optical resistance to the beam
as the sand sand looses its prismatic properties when molten.
   Prismatic/Reflective: In order to be able to treat with all possible
wavelengths, this sand has both prismatic and reflective properties, trying to
slow overheating.
   Reactive: This sand is basically prismatic, but when molten the surface
becomes almost totally reflective. If not evaporated the sand will become solid
after cooling down and regain its prismatic properties.
   Enhanced Reactive: Improvement in so far as the sand will use up energy in
very energy consuming chemical processes when evaporation begins.



Well I guess that\'s it. Comments, criticism, flames and flowers are welcome!

May the force be with the poor sod, along with a few matrix crystals
(ALA Marion Zimmer Bradly, Darkover), some gods, and a lot of luck.

Has anything more been heard of this convention? Specifically, have any major
gaming companies been approached with the convention, and how have they
reacted? Has GDW been approached?

Discussion

[The discussion below makes use of the details outlined in the convention
document as cited above, and is not intended as a challenge to the original
work. The convention was originally developed by:
        jimv@cs.ucr.edu (Jim Vassilakos)
        larrys@zk3.dec.com (Larry Smith)
        jhahn@nslsilus.org (Joel "Aardy" Hahn)
        guy.sbd-e@rx.xerox.com (Guy Robinson) ]

At first, I thought that the following was applicable:
"While the prop description may not be copied outright and verbatim, the vitals
of props may be inserted into unofficial game supplements and adventures as
long as the source of the material is properly cited (see Subsection II. F
below)."
"Prop" = a "thing" of an RPG, specifically an thing which a character can
         interact with. eg. a monster, a spell, a skill, a character class,
         an item (in our terms, a specific Vargr character is not a prop, but a
         generic Vargr thug IS a prop).
"Vital" = a specific value associated with a particular prop. eg. "HP=3, AC=6,
          Dam=1d4".
"Description" = information about the prop which cannot be quantified in game
                terms. eg. "The Giant Chicken lives in giant chicken coops in
                Wisconsin where hero-wizards tend their flocks of sheep".

Now, it may be that a planet\'s statistics can be considered to be "prop vitals".
Under the convention, the vitals can be used in unofficial game supplements
and adventures as long as the source is quoted.

However, after reading the convention again, I realised that a planet,
especially a complete list of planets for the Regency, might be considered to
be a "place".
"Place" = "an imaginary locality in a game setting". eg. Waterdeep, Shadowdale.

"Places" ARE under copyright, according to the convention, and you cannot use
them without permission of the copyright holder.

(BTW, note that "characters" are also copyright. In theory under the
convention, we cannot publish adventures that mention Norris or Plankwell or
Strephon unless we have permission. This is probably the main right that an
"Approved by GDW" sticker gives to its holder.)

Question 2:

So, with this in mind, what is the answer? Because planets have "vitals", are
they "props"? Or, because they are so much part of the game setting, are they
"places"? I dunno, maybe only the ones with descriptions are "places", just
like only fleshed-out NPC\'s are "characters".

It gets a little tricky.  The damage is done in MJ.  If a 1000MJ PAW hits
the globe, it absorbs 1000MJ.  The caps h are listed in MJs, so you\'d
just convert this using the conversion table (I\'d think.  It is for
damage, though, not MJ :-/

It\'s not in BL at all (at least my edition).

The FFS section on BGs states that if it comes in contact with anything
over 50tons (asteroids, planets, etc.) it blows up.

As I understood it at the time, the licence agreement was that FASA would
send everything to Paramount for approval before it was distributed. FASA
printed two TNG products (Next Gen First Year Sourcebook and Next Gen
Officer\'s Manual) and wanted to distribute them together. I was told that
the First Year Sourcebook was approved and that FASA issued the Officer\'s
Manual _before_ sending it to Paramount. As a result of this, Paramount
pulled the licence.

This struck me at the time (and still does) that Paramount were looking for
a reason to pull the licence and took the first excuse that presented
itself.

believe

Dave Neilson (in an interview with RPI) called the Star Trek licence "..the
licence that eats its young...". I don\'t think FASA were blameless, but I
still don\'t think what they did merited the loss of the licence.

There is a Star Trek RPG (of sorts, it\'s actually a Starfleet Battles RPG -
but Star Trek is in its parentage).

Check out their Masterbook rules system, or TORG, or Shatterzone (they\'re
basically the same system after all). Look at the rules. Read the rules.
Read them again (and again, and again until you understand them). Play it.
You thought TNE was complicated?

Neither did I, but apparently they do. I understand the problem concerns
some of the mechs used in the original game which are mentioned in the
licence. I know nothing more than that.

Or spreading the rumours that they are on the way out. I agree with Harold
here, we should support GDW in whatever way we can.

The point I was trying to make the other day was that we shouldn\'t be
arguing over who we are going to ask to buy something that isn\'t ours to
sell as if GDW is already gone, before GDW have actually gone.

Here we are, arguing over the grave goods, while the owner is lying sick in
another room. We wouldn\'t do that to our own families, so why are we doing
it to GDW?

>   the best thing you can do  is to go out and buy a GDW product.

and continue your support in other areas. Run some participation games at
shows (or even at club), write for Valkyrie or Traveller Chronicle or
another magazine. Make other people curious enough to go out and buy
Traveller (or T2K, etc.) to see what the fuss is about.

Hopefully we all will. :-)

They\'re into a couple of new things, including developing new

info, though it may take a while for a response.

The rights to DGP was bought by Hyperodge: this includes the old
development material for Zhodani & Droyne: the Psionic Races, which was
never published.  I doubt if they have the time to publish it now, and
whether they still have the GDW license to do so... I simply don\'t know.

Previous to Hyperodge, DGP was shut down after GDW shifted over to TNE,
sometime in 1990, I think.

I\'d say it might be something as in Isaac Asimov\'s Foundation series
(Regarding Old Empire) That is, the people have become so comfortable and
thiks everythings so "jolly" that noone really cares to begin researching
again in a rapid pace. And those that were interested in research didn\'t get
all that much support from the government or companies to make their
research possible.

This might be one explanation at least. Earth have had several periods like
this I believe. Such as in the 17-18 century when the fysiologist thought
that everything had been discovered in the case of Fysics (Boy were they wrong!)

Just a thought.

The story I got from Sam Lewis, high muckety-muck of FASA at the time,
at a con in 1991 or so was that Paramount had this notion that what
people wanted to do with the STRPG was roleplay the characters of the
TV series in situations like the TV series. They didn\'t seem to have a
notion of the many types of people who play RPGs, including the people
who like combat/tactical situations. As a result, Paramount was
displeased with FASA STRPG adventures where a "military" solution was
even a suboptimal option, and were particularly displeased by the
concept of a "Star Fleet Marines" product, slated to come out soon
after that particular point in time. They thus pulled the license
because the STRPG wasn\'t evolving according to Roddenberry\'s vision or
some such. The bit with TNG stuff provided an added excuse as they
were able to use the fact that TNG was still being made at the time to
exert creative control over products related to it.

Me, I was just waiting for _Operation: Armageddon_, but apparently it
never got beyond the development stage.

The Battletech disputes are probably between FASA and licensees of
various anime series, as some of the mechs are clear copies of things
like the mechs in the _SDF Macross_ series (which was turned into part
one of the _Robotech_ series in the US).

No, DGP is NOT out there.  They went out of business.

However, Roger Sanger (Cyberodge), who haunts here on occaision bought the
rights to their product line.

Note: this Wednesday Wizard of the Coast killed all their RPG products
(including Ars Magica, Everway, etc.) and instead decided to produce only
game cards (ie Magic, etc.).

Ughh.

Now, we know of the differences some people (including me) have with GDW,
but I\'m starting to be more sympathetic to GDW\'s plight rather than angry
due to their... unwise... decisions.

I hope they manage to pull out of their current downward slope, and hope
that they realize A) the necessity of producing high-quality products B)
the need to eventually reconcile ye olde Classic fans, without
abandoning those who actually like the RC.

The Regency Sourcebook is a good start in this direction, and might serve
as the turnaround point for GDW.

I miscalculated the jump fuel needed for the Light Cruiser: it had only
enough for one parsec.  So I axed 100 of the low-berth crew to make up
more space.  One-third of the staterooms were also removes, and
hot-bunking was instituted.

This new fuel space makes the Nigiyabazi have "unlimited" fuel for Battle
Rider purposes, increasing it\'s flexibility (and nullifying some of the
strategic analysis I posted previously).

Every starfleet needs a vast number of these unglamourous ships - although
you never seem to see them in "Imperial Stars", "Strike Fleet", or any of the
other popular VR entertainment programs in the Imperium.  Never mind
that: without thousands and thousands of glorified cargo barges like these,
the Imperial Navy would swiftly grind to a halt.

First built in 138, these flying bricks perfectly reflect the big, bulky
and dour design philosophy of the Vilani.  They also happen to be quite
capable in their work: after all, 1000 years later they still serve in
innumerable frontier fleets, as tankers and second-tier naval logstics
vessels.

(In a pinch they can support Marine contigments, but lack the
armour to serve in any more hostile environment than your typical
bushfire rebellion.  They also lack sufficent on-board cargo shuttles,
and the Marines get to sleep in the cargo hold - hopefully modified to
house them, rather than sleeping on the bare floor.

The Orrimot DOES at least have CG lifters, unlike most dedicated space
tankers/freighters.  So it can lift off, as well as land...)

These ships are rarely seen in civilian service: the two large hamster cages
used to mimic gravity is rather unpopular among merchants, and civilian
fuel stations have rendered tanker jumpships a poor economic gamble.
Also, most merchants find the additional cost to maintain the inefficent
dual fusion plants not worth the greater safety margin.  And the 10
lifeboats are SO passe, and an unnecessary expense - although the crews
doesn\'t seem to mind.

Actually, since so many thousands (probably millions over the
years) of them have been made, I\'d suspect that they\'d be all over
the place, in most cases, modified beyond recognition.  Sort of like
liberty ships, or LST\'s after WWII. The tramp frieghters of the
spaceways...you know, the ones that leave an oil spots in your
starport after they leave ;-)

Never underestimate what people will latch onto as useful
transportation.  If they\'re so unpopular, surplus ones are dirt
cheap, probably cheaper than a free trader, maybe even cheaper than a
scout, but I doubt it. This is what are turned into bannana boats,
or copra freighters, or those freighters that ply the truly poor
backwaters of the imperium.

 I almost got to live in a LST (Landing Ship-Tank) that had been
converted to a coastal frieghter that had been converted to an oyster
boat that had been converted to a houseboat; but it would have meant
living in New York Harbor during the winter....yeeeesh.  But that\'s
+6probably what\'ll get done to most of these things.

As one gets past the introductory literature, however, it
becomes clear that, to the League, the most important aspect of
Imperial life was the human supremacy within the old Imperium.  This
view of history is a rather distorted one; it is more true, in fact,
to say that humans had their "supremacy" in what is now Coalition
Space during the Dark Years between the fall of the Imperium and the
birth of the Dawn League.
The League has its roots in a pair of Dawn League-era political
groups, the Fires of Dawn (founded on Fija) and Oriflamme\'s Humaniti
Alliance.  Both were responsible, in the Dawn League years, for
bills denying full citizenship rights to Schalli, Chirpers and
Droyne, Ithklur, and Hivers.  Such blatant racism was generally
voted down in planetary legislatures; those defeats served only to
further fire the zealots in the two groups.  As intersystem trade
and communication increased, both the Fires and the Alliance saw
each other as distant allies; they began cosponsoring events on other
worlds in the League and working closely on other projects.
The most dangerous and ambitious of these projects was an
attempt to release an engineered viral weapon upon the native Schalli
residents of Aubaine in early N.E. 1; the trio responsible
represented the top-level leadership of both groups, and was arrested
and convicted on charges of attempted terroristic attack in short
order.
A Luhtahlan woman named Sanlii Buckner has come to the fore
of the pro-human movement (as it is euphemistically called) since that
time.  Where the Fires and the Alliance were openly inflammatory,
Buckner\'s League of the Imperial Way is controlled, some might say
stealthy.
A fairly slick marketing campaign is in place on several of
the high-population worlds of the Coalition, inviting new members
to come and experience the "regalia and pageantry of the old Imperium";
the commercials and advertisements show only humans.  Recruitment
is low-key at first, as well; the League is seen by most non-members
as a social club.
Legislation put into place by the few RC Assembly members
under the sway of the League is more subtle than the laws its
predecessors tried to get into place. For instance, regulation of
high-security RC installations may soon be locked to the voiceprints
and palmprints of those allowed to enter, which will cause no end
of hassle for Schalli and Hivers;  some Centrist Leaguers have
suggested encouraging the RCN\'s support staff to come up with a
unified meal plan for Navy bases and ships, which could easily be
skewed toward human dietary necessity; and so on.
The modern League, then, is not generally seen as a xenophobic
or terrorist group, but rather as a social club.  Prejudice by
League members and of League actions is not overt but subtle; Buckner\'s
hope is to give nonhumans in the RC area a thousand little annoyances
rather than one spectacular firebombing.
Lastly, it should be noted that the Fires of Dawn does still
exist, though the Humaniti Alliance has crumbled.  The more radical
members of the Fires lost interest in Buckner\'s large-scale strategy
pretty early on, and are still playing at terrorism.  Rumors abound
that the Fires gets much of its funding from the League, but it is
unlikely that this can be proved.  Other rumors imply that numerous
small, anti-alien groups have received donations and guidance from
the League, but again, if such a thing is true, tracing it would
be difficult; Buckner knows when to hide her tracks.

Notes:

In the Regency Navy, knowledge is power, and the ability to quickly transmit
and convey information can mean the difference between a conflict averted, a
conflict won and a conflict lost.  The Type S6 Long Range Courier is
designed with this maxim in mind - to transmit information as quickly as
possible.

The Type S6 crams a Jump-6 drive and fuel tankage for two consecutive jumps
into a standard Scout/Courier hull, allowing a twelve parsec journey to be
completed in 15 days (a full day is allowed between jumps in non-emergency
situations for diagnostics and routine maintenance on the jump drive).  Fuel
scoops and purification machinery allow a third jump to take place in as
little as 12 hours (the remainder of the fuel can be processed while the
ship is in j-space).

Naturally, the drive to extend the Type S6\'s range has led to some
sacrifices.  The ship carries no weaponry - even the hardpoint socket has
been removed to fit in more fuel.  The ship also has limited endurance in
normal space, with only 11 G-turns (without jump fuel), the Type S6 is not
expected to do anything other than head directly to it\'s destination upon
emerging into normal space.  Only three crew are present - one maneuver
officer also doubles as the ship\'s electronics officer, although there is a
dedicated engineer on-board.  Crew accommodations allow four a single
passenger to be carried if required.

In times of conflict, the Type S6 is expected to jump into the outer system,
far beyond reach of planetary defenses, and jump out after burst-tranmission
of it\'s data cargo to Naval assets in-system.

The Type S6 (aka \'Uiderfowl\', after a migratory bird found on Lysen) was
designed by Fremantle Shipyards in 1197 in response to RFT-1195-110 (a
Request For Tender issued by the Regency Navy in 1195).  The first Uiderfowl
was launched on 014-1199, and was commissioned into the Navy in 1200.  After
extended trials, the type entered regular service in 1201, and an extended
production run is anticipated.

To date, 70 examples have been ordered:  22 of these are to be produced at
Fremantle\'s Number Three yard on Jewell, the remainder will be manufactured
under license throughout the Regency.  The \'Uiderfowl\' is not exepected to
be offered on the civillian starship market.  A number of these will be
conversions from existing Type S hulls, Fremantle Shipyards is preparing a
conversion kit to assist manufacturers.

IN NEAR BOOTES COMMONWEALTH SERVICE

The \'Uiderfowl\' is not in service within the Near Bootes Commonwealth.

IN REFORMATION COALITION SERVICE

The \'Uiderfowl\' is not in service within the Reformation Coalition, or
adjacent space.

IN THE REGENCY

After entering regular service in 1201, eight examples of the \'Uiderfowl\'
are currently in service.  Two have been attached to the RQS, and are in
service in Quarantine District 5A as part of RQS peacekeeping duties in The
Islands.

VARIANTS

Althought no known variants are in service, Fremantle Shipyards is working
on a number of variants which will be offered to the Navy.  The Type
S6-ELINT will feature an improved passive EMS array, as well as additional
sensor suites and will be used to gather electronic intelligence in
potentially hostile systems.  The improved sensors comes at a cost of
reduced flexibility - the S6-ELINT sacrifices fuel purification
capabilities, instead relying on it\'s existing fuel tankage to jump directly
into and out of target systems from a support base.  Fremantle is also
believed to be negotiating with Ling Standard Products Advanced Systems
Division on Mora to produced an improved TL-16 version of the S6.

Well, the Orrimot is just the oldest and the most primitive of the vast
(an I mean VAST) array of cargo/refuelers that has been built for the
Imperial Navy over the centuries.  "Ugly, stinky, and full of odd grinding
noises" is the usual shorthand description.  Cheap, also, for it\'s purpose:
discounts on the price may hit 80%, since the basic model\'s so well
known.  Even it\'s base price is quite reasonable for a tanker of it\'s
type, as it lacks expensive artificial gravity.  For the cash-strapped
colonial and planetary navies which need a handy jump-3 tanker/cargo
ship, this is the way to go.

I would feel that it\'s unpopularity would stem from the hard-to-find
part\'s and supplies it needs, as it was designed before most of
the modern Imperial Naval Part\'s spec\'s were set.  Fortunately, the Orrimot
spec\'s are usually ancient ancestors to today\'s spec\'s, and the
relationship is close enough so that, even if you can\'t find exactly
what you\'re looking for, you can jury-rig something fairly easily.

Just don\'t expect to win any popularity contest with the Orrimot.  Even
the crew of Morraine free traders - who\'s TL A design isn\'t exactly
cutting edge technology - enjoy sneering at the Orrimot\'s obvious hamster
cages
  "Hamster cages? What museum did you rob?  Don\'t tell me: you
  Solomani/Humans/Imperials STILL don\'t get artigrav technology, don\'t
  you?"
ample supply of liferafts
  "Ten liferafts?  Obviously, you don\'t QUITE trust your pilot - not that
  I blame you, seeing the sorry excuse of a landing approach you made..."
and overall cheapness
  "Yeah, just look for the Orrimot.  You know, the building with
   the stubby wings slapped on it\'s sides.  Watch out though, the
   crystaliron (giggleSNORT) hull\'s a bit rusty, chunks of it might lick
   your head if you bang on it too hard..."

However, Vilani with a sense of history and tradition (ie: all Vilani) will
get a kick of crewing a Orrimot, extolling it\'s solid, no-nonsense
stability and falling in love with it\'s profoundly ancient control
interfaces
  "Hey, don\'t you just LOVE these piloting gauges! I mean, they\'re
   pratically ANALOG!  And I bet the wiring hasn\'t been changed since the
   Zhutastu Dynasty!"
  "Well, I don\'t know about this software..."
  "What?  WRITTEN CODE?"  Shoves doubtful captain aside, look over code
  "Yes!  Hold on a minute... maybe it\'s..." Praticaly explodes with joy on
   the bridge "JUMP TAPES!  Genuine JUMP TAPES, without any of those cheap
   modern upgrades!"
  Captain turns ashen. "You mean we have to buy blindingly expensive
   jumptapes for *every* *single* *system* we want to visit?"
  The Vilani engineer - with a delighted gleam in her eye - replies
   "Absolutely! Just like in The Good Old Days!"
  Captains\' eyes roll into her head as she crumples to the floor.

And when we say poor, we mean POOR.

Actually, until Norris upgraded so many systems, there were several areas
within the Spinward Marches where the Orrimot\'s technology and weaponry
was actually superiour to anything locally produced (speaking of civilian
ships, of course).  Which goes to show why Marchmen were considered the
poor and violent hicks of the Third Imperium - any system that can be
dominated by an Orrimot is DEFINITELY out of the loop.

   Overheard in a Gushemege bar, 1109:
  "The Spinward Marches are so poor, you could conquer half the worlds
   with nothing but a few Orrimot\'s and ten FGMP-15\'s."
  "The Zho\'s seem to have a rough time of it..."
  "No FGMP-15\'s."

In the Spinward Marches (pre-Rebellion), there were far more Orrimot\'s
being used as refuellers to support C- and D-level ports then were
actually used as cargo ships. (Sometimes, the only difference between them
was that if the Orrimot\'s fuel refining equipment still worked, the port
was cassified "C": if not, then it was "D")

Neat! About time we started getting some diversity in the RC.
Remember, during the rebellion this area was under Solomani
occupation for a while; actually, according to the TNS (in Survival
Margin) the Old Expanses voluntarily incorporated into the

I\'m workin\' on it. :)  Next up is a violently anti-tech
underground group known as the Biota.  But gimme another week or so; this
whole day job thing doesn\'t intersect well with gaming.  Also in the
hopper is the Vezina Pacification Committee and the Spencer Underground.
I\'d love to see others (hint hint, RC players); I\'m trying to change the
RC from a monolith or quasi-monolith to someplace a touch more (dare I
say it) punk, at least in my own game.  That\'s a style my players like.

This is a nifty idea; it\'s something I hadn\'t considered.  Sanlii
Buckner is not, by my original conception, a remnant SolSeccer, but that
doesn\'t mean that there aren\'t some of those influencing her or the whole
"pro-human" movement.  I think I\'ll need to reread "Rats & Cats".

purposes of this discussion this can be rounded to 1.4 million km.

  As it happens, 1 Astronomical Unit is 149.6 million km, or slightly over
100 diameters out from the Sun, which is the standard for Stellar Diameter.
This leads to a good approximation: The Stellar Diameter table (present in
Book 6:Scouts) also gives the distance in AU of the local Stellar Jump
Horizon.  Compare this to the Orbits table or simply convert it to millions
of kilometers (or range in hexes) to get a useful number for calculating
travel times.

  Now, it could be TTrue ("Traveller True") that masses like a star have
an additional effect on the actual range to their Jump Horizon. It sounds
like an additional complication I don\'t really need.


  The more annoying problem is with Gas Giants and their attendent moons.
While it is easy to tell IF a given moon is within the GGs Jump Horizon,
getting the GGs actual diameter to calculate travel times requires a dig
through the reference material to find a table for gas giant sizes (there
are several such in Traveller books).  Forewarned, a referee can have the
actual diameters of important (to the story; I don\'t recommend doing this
for every gas giant in the sector) Gas Giants.

Dear Christopher,

So you want FASA to buy Traveler.  It\'s an interesting idea, I\'ll grant you
that.  But to be honest, we filled the void of Star Trek 3 years ago-with
Earthdawn.  Producing a licensed product is always difficult, that is one of the
reasons we let Star Trek fade away.  We have found that there is much more
artistic freedom working on something created ourselves.  As nice as it could
be, it\'s just not worth the headaches.  Sorry.  But, it\'s a fun notion to
entertain.

Thanks for the thoughts!

Sincerely,


Jill Lucas

hope that GDW may still get their house in order and the game may survive.  I

Power: Power usage in Mw equals volume in m^3 x 0.05.
Price: Price in MCr equals RV x 0.15.

   Sandscreens need a sand storage to replace burned up sand. This is
proportional to the maximum number of damage value absorbed, not in one
shot but as a whole.
   The designer selects the total amount of damage value to be absorbed and
the type of sand to be used be the screen.
The table shows weight, volume and price per absorbed damage point.

Explanation:
----
   Ablative: This sand is made to dissipate the beam by simply evaporating and
dispersing the beam in the process.
   Enhanced Ablative: This type of sand is an enhancement on ablative sand. The
material uses up more in chemical reactions and disperses the beam with slight
prismatic capabilities.
   Prismatic: As the same says, this sand disperses the beam by its prismatic
properties while offering as little as possible optical resistance to the beam
as the sand sand looses its prismatic properties when molten.
   Prismatic/Reflective: In order to be able to treat with all possible
wavelengths, this sand has both prismatic and reflective properties, trying to
slow overheating.
   Reactive: This sand is basically prismatic, but when molten the surface
becomes almost totally reflective. If not evaporated the sand will become solid
after cooling down and regain its prismatic properties.
   Enhanced Reactive: Improvement in so far as the sand will use up energy in
very energy consuming chemical processes when evaporation begins.



Well I guess that\'s it. Comments, criticism, flames and flowers are welcome!

Since W. Brown\'s gentle spoof of the PC world and the old Night before
Christmas was well received, perhaps a few folks will like the following,
which I pulled off the Public Radio list, and heaven only knows where it
originated.  But, as a gummint worker, I swear I read stuff like this
every day- that\'s not supposed to be funny!

Subject: Twas the Night Before Christmas, and All the Engineers were asleep.

        **** \'Twas the Night Before Christmas  ****
                       - Written by a technical writer working on a
                         Government contract

\'Twas the nocturnal segment of the diurnal period preceding the annual
Yuletide celebration, and throughout the place of residence, kinetic
activity was not in evidence among the possessors of this potential,
including that species of domestic rodent known as Mus musculus (mouse).
Hosiery was meticulously suspended from the forward edge of the wood
burning caloric apparatus, pursuant to our anticipatory pleasure
regarding an imminent visitation from an eccentric philanthropist among
whose folkloric appellations is the honorific title of St. Nicholas.

The prepubescent siblings, comfortably ensconced in their respective
accommodations of repose, were experiencing subconscious visual
hallucinations of variegated fruit confections moving rhythmically
through their cerebrums.  My conjugal partner and I, attired in our
nocturnal head coverings, were about to take slumberous advantage of the
hibernal darkness when upon the avenaceous exterior portion of the
grounds there ascended such a cacophony of dissonance that I felt
compelled to arise with alacrity from my place of repose for the purpose
of ascertaining the precise source thereof.

Hastening to the casement, I forthwith opened the barriers sealing this
fenestration, noting thereupon that the lunar brilliance without,
reflected as it was on the surface of a recent crystalline
precipitation, might be said to rival that of the solar meridian itself
- thus permitting my incredulous optical sensory organs to behold a
miniature airborne runnered conveyance drawn by eight diminutive
specimens of the genus Rangifer, piloted by a minuscule, aged chauffeur
so ebullient and nimble that it became instantly apparent to me that he
was indeed our anticipated caller. With his ungulate motive power
traveling at what may possibly have been more vertiginous velocity than
patriotic alar predators, he vociferated loudly, expelled breath
musically through contracted labia, and addressed each of the octet by
his or her respective cognomen - "Now Dasher, now Dancer..." et al. -
guiding them to the uppermost exterior level of our abode, through which
structure I could readily distinguish the concatenations of each of the
32 cloven pedal extremities.

As I retracted my cranium from its erstwhile location, and was
performing a 180-degree pivot, our distinguished visitant achieved -
with utmost celerity and via a downward leap - entry by way of the smoke
passage. He was clad entirely in animal pelts soiled by the ebony
residue from oxidations of carboniferous fuels which had accumulated on
the walls thereof. His resemblance to a street vendor I attributed
largely to the plethora of assorted playthings which he bore dorsally in
a commodious cloth receptacle.

His orbs were scintillant with reflected luminosity, while his
submaxillary dermal indentations gave every evidence of engaging
amiability. The capillaries of his malar regions and nasal appurtenance
were engorged with blood which suffused the subcutaneous layers, the
former approximating the coloration of Albion\'s floral emblem, the
latter that of the Prunus avium, or sweet cherry.  His amusing sub- and
supralabials resembled nothing so much as a common loop knot, and their
ambient hirsute facial adornment appeared like small, tabular and
columnar crystals of frozen water.

Clenched firmly between his incisors was a smoking piece whose grey
fumes, forming a tenuous ellipse about his occiput, were suggestive of a
decorative seasonal circlet of holly. His visage was wider than it was
high, and when he waxed audibly mirthful, his corpulent abdominal region
undulated in the manner of impectinated fruit syrup in a hemispherical
container. He was, in short, neither more nor less than an obese,
jocund, multigenarian gnome, the optical perception of whom rendered me
visibly frolicsome despite every effort to refrain from so being. By
rapidly lowering and then elevating one eyelid and rotating his head
slightly to one side, he indicated that trepidation on my part was
groundless.

Without utterance and with dispatch, he commenced filling the
aforementioned appended hosiery with various of the aforementioned
articles of merchandise extracted from his aforementioned previously
dorsally transported cloth receptacle.  Upon completion of this task, he
executed an abrupt about-face, placed a single manual digit in lateral
juxtaposition to his olfactory organ, inclined his cranium forward in a
gesture of leave-taking, and forthwith effected his egress by
renegotiating (in reverse) the smoke passage. He then propelled himself
in a short vector onto his conveyance, directed a musical expulsion of
air through his contracted oral sphincter to the antlered quadrupeds of
burden, and proceeded to soar aloft in a movement hitherto observable
chiefly among the seed-bearing portions of a common weed. But I
overheard his parting exclamation, audible immediately prior to his
vehiculation beyond the limits of visibility: "Ecstatic Yuletide to the
planetary constituency, and to that self same assemblage, my sincerest
wishes for a salubriously beneficial and gratifyingly pleasurable period
between sunset and dawn."

Two new products hit the shelves this week:
the Regency Combat Vehicle Guide; and
The Guilded Lilly, an adventure in Diaspora sector.

Here are sanitized, general audience, no-spoilers
reviews (unexpurgated comments on Guilded Lilly will
follow in a separate, clearly marked post):


Regency Combat Vehicle Guide
48 pages, $12 (US)

32 TL-14 and -15 tanks, APCs, fire support vehicles,
command variants, etc., etc. With 22 illustrations.

4 pages on Regency army and marine terminology,
standardizations, organization, and unit dispositions.

1 page ad for the Regency Starship Guide (early \'96)

What can I say? Everything from Norris Grav Tanks to
meson artillery to a military air-raft variants. You want
stats and descriptions of combat vehicles, you got \'em.

Folks down in RC-land can use most of this as a guide
to relic Imperial (and with a name change, Solomani) vehicles.

Stats are laid out in standard format (which unfortunately
includes a Regency version of that dopey "computer screen" border).

Recommended.

and now on to:


(no-spoilers review)

The Guilded Lilly
Part One of the Virus Redux Epic
48 pages, $12 (US)

Based on the ads for it and the player breifing at the
start, I can safely say this much about the plot:

The players are Arces sent by Papa\'s LoROG (Long
Range Operations Group, formerly just "the Planning
Group") on a mission beyond the AO to an important
crossroads world in Diaspora sector in order to make
friendly contact on behalf of the Coalition. While there,
they encounter something different: a _newly built_
trader, courtesy of the Guild. Highjinks ensue.

First the good news: a) finally, an RC adventure that
doesn\'t start with the premise of the players assaulting
someplace; b) it requires no other products save the
rulebook itself (though that means about 4 pages
are reprinted from other sources, which is also bad news);
c)_Victrix deck plans!_; d) actual painted cover art, not
the computer-art stuff we\'ve been getting; e) enough
info to put faces on the usual "faceless NPCs" at the
destination world.

Of course, now\'s the time to drop the other shoe:

It needs major revision of the actual playing out of
events, and possibly the basic premise.

Some events are highly contrived, others pop up
very abruptly. (they seem to have forgotten the
"Hitchcock principle" i.e.: set a bomb off, the
audience jumps. Let the audience know a bomb will
go off in a few minutes, and suspense will build
the entire time) In balancing things for the finale,
they also seem to have forgotten the crew complement
of the players\' ship.

Things are also focusses tightly (painfully so) through
the lens of "Coalition=Good, Guild=Bad". There are
one or two opportunites for the players to stick their
foots in their mouths, but unless they practically murder
someone, a lot of local goodwill will virtually drop in their
laps.

Technical faults: the maps and deck plans need a scale,
and there\'s a few really glaring proofreading screwups.

Finally, I\'d advise against putting aliens in the crews of
other ships in port unless you\'re ready for players to
press you for details on their world of origin. Also, if
you have any access to CT articles on Vegans and
Bwaps, I\'d strongly suggest using them for any aliens
rather than "Aslan, or even Vargr", as mentioned in the
text.


I\'ll be more specific about complaints (and fixes for them)
in a followup post.

This describes a two stage hypervelocity gun, that\'s been built at
Lawrence Livermore National Labs.  They use it to test materials at
extremely high pressures and velocities.  I think it\'s a fascinating
concept for some of those downtrodden TED\'s to defend themselves from
the RC, Virus, or just about anyone you want.

I\'ll let their own words describe it:

"In the fall of 1994 we had the opportunity to witness and
participate in a series of hypervelocity experiments at the SHARP
(Super High Altitude Research Project) facility at Lawrence
Livermore National Lab. The SHARP gas gun is the largest two-stage
light gas gun in the world and is used as a hypersonic research
facility. Projectiles 1-10 kg in mass are fired horizontally into
air, past high-speed diagnostic equipment (roughly 20 m flight path),
and into a projectile-retaining area, a concrete bunker filled with
sand. Recent experiments testing hypervelocity scram-jet engines
provided us with the opportunity to conduct a hypervelocity impact
experiment at no cost with a total energy (20 MJ) more than 3 orders
of magnitude larger than previous studies. "

20 MJ at TL 8...heh heh heh...you have your basic drop ship assault
going when KAH-WHOOM...your RC Cruiser is half gone, and there is no
clear picture of where it came from...no sensor trace on any missile,
no beam trace, just a gaping hole where your engineering section was.

There are descriptions of the design of two stage guns in the Web
page, as well as further bibliographic reference material.  Sounds
like another thing the Guild might just sell those wealthier TEDS out
there, like the \'crunch guns\' (in the back of \'Path of
Tears\'...basically 14.5 mm sniper rifles) that are popping up.

BTW, is anyone else as disgusted by the breakdown of the FFS rules
for those rifles as I am...if they were designed with FFS?  They\'re
about three times as heavy as real rifles of the type...69 kg!  The
Barrett .50 cal sniper rifle in current use by the US armed forces is
only 22 kg, and it\'s not much smaller (12.5 mm) than the 14.5 mm
caliber of the crunch gun.

It would certainly blow up if an asteroid passed through the globe, but the
reason it explodes is that the matter passing through the globe is cooled to
absolute zero, which for any appreciable mass is so high as to blow the
capacitors. However, if a black globe was hovering stationary in the
atmosphere, the mass passing through the globe through air diffusion might be
low enough that it wouldn\'t blow up. As such the black globe could operate as a
giant powerstation, extracting heat from the air and beaming the energy to
terrestrial stations as the globe flickers. The visual impact of this sort of
power station would be impressive, as liquified air falls from the bottom of
the globe, precipitating water out of the atmosphere below to form a region of
snow below. Worlds using this power source heavily might even cultivate a
greenhouse effect to prevent excessive global cooling.
In military situations it would be harder to use black globes, as movement
would increase the energy traffic, and the globe would have a smaller margin
with which to deal with enemy fire.

Cool!  There\'s other hyper-velocity research going on (I believe the Navy
is also doing some); there was an article about it in Smithsonian Air&Space
magazine a while back (I don\'t have the article handy).  It\'s nice to have
a current pointer to the data.

Yes; it\'s my feeling that RCES military-intervention scenarios are a a *lot*
more risky than portrayed in \'Path of Tears\'.  Particularly if alerted to
the possibility of an invasion from space, societies from about TL-4 or 5
to TL-7 or 8 are quite capable of doing significant damage to TL-11+
spacebourne forces.

Yes.  The Crunch Gun was designed exactly to FF&S rules, as published.

> They\'re about three times as heavy as real rifles of the type...69 kg!

Actually, both \'Path of Tears\' and the \'RC Equipment Guide\' give the
weapon\'s mass as 53.787kg (loaded).  This is still more than twice
what it should be.  Most of the extra mass is in the reciever (which
masses more than the entire real-life weapon) and bipod.  FF&S makes
both of these components proportional to the muzzle energy, which is
probably *very* incorrect (particularly in the case of the bipod).

The "Crunch Gun" *IS* a Soviet WWII-era PRTS-41 anti-armor rifle.

I know, because I\'m the designer; it\'s uncredited in \'Path of Tears\' but
should be properly credited in the RC Equipment Guide.

The mass *should* be 20.86kg empty, and 22.053kg loaded.

The PTRS-41 was the weapon for which the 14.5mm (that\'s about .57 cal)
BS-41 ammunition was originally designed.  The anti-armor rifle was
introduced in WWII, but the cartridge was retained after the war in the
KPV machinegun (where it is still used).  KPV ammunition is available
in Armor-Piercing Incendiary, Incendiary/Tracer, and Explosive.

If you\'re interested, the PTRS-41 design was originally sent to GDW
during the playtesting of FF&S as an example of what\'s wrong with
the FF&S small-arms design sequence.  FF&S produces *very* incorrect
results at the extremes of the design range; the closer you are to
a \'modern\' assault rifle (such as the M-16), the more accurate the
numbers are.

If you\'re curious, here\'s the "Crunch Gun" design sheet (I had originally
dubbed it the "Poor Man\'s Fusion Gun", but I guess that didn\'t stick; the
indented text was included with the design in my submission to GDW, and
it may sound familiar to those of you who have read the \'Path of Tears\'
scenarios):


        No longer do your TL-5, xenophobic natives have to cower
        in fear of Reformation Coalition backed Star Vikings.
        Have the local warlord call up a few squads of these "poor
        man\'s fusion guns".  With Ball ammunition (locally available
        at TL-5), they can penetrate TL-10 Battle Dress and any
        Combat Armor.

        With DS ammunition (a TL-8 item), these weapons have damage
        and penetration equal to (or better than, particularly at
        longer ranges) the FGMP-14 and FGMP-15 and can effectively
        defeat all forms of personal armor, as well as the side,
        deck, belly, and turret armor of the G-Carrier and the Grav Tank.

        Given their relative low cost, particularly when compared
        to their high-tech opponents Battle Dress (Cr220,000) and
        Fusion Gun (Cr54,000), these weapons are clearly very
        cost-effective.

        Notes:
        1 - Whenever two figures are given, the first is for ball
        (an option for Armor-Piercing Incendiary would have been
        nice) and the second is for the "high-tech" (TL-8)
        Discarding Sabot round.

        Comments:
        Yes, this really was a real gun.  Originally designed as
        a man portable, anti-tank small arms rifle by the Soviets
        during WWII, the gun was quickly outclassed by the rapidly
        improving armor protection of German tanks.

        The cartridge lives on as the ammuntion for the TL-6 KPV
        machinegun (found on many Soviet armored vehicles and
        anti-aircraft defenses).  The gas-operated action of this
        rifle (scaled down, of course) found its way into the SKS rifle.

        All in all, I\'m not really very happy with this FF&S design;
        the weapon came out more than twice as heavy as it should
        have (a hundred-and-fifteen pound rifle).  I think the
        problem here is that the FF&S design system is too linear;
        if you push on the high end, you get guns that are much too
        big and heavy, and if you push on the low end, you get
        things like 10mm (cal) by 3mm (long) cartridges and guns
        that are much too light.

        Tactical Considerations:
        The close range of this weapon exceeds the extreme range of
        every fusion gun except the FGMP-14 and -15, and the short
        range equals or exceeds the extreme range of any of the
        fusion guns.  The best use of these weapons would be long
        range fire at the attackers, from behind cover (preferably
        cover strong enough to resist an extreme-range fusion gun
        strike) or sniping from outside the range of the enemy\'s
        weapons.  If this is impossible (and it frequently is),
        then a series protected positions likeley to suprise the
        enemy are good (around a corner in a corridor, for example).

        Game Use:
        This weapon (or rather, one using the "real world" stats
        and not the FF&S design, which is completely impractical)
        could be quite useful to anti-RC forces in the New Era.
        A relatively low-tech design, it is quite capable of being
        manufactured by many worlds in the Wilds.  Although the DS
        ammunition is probably going to be considerably harder to
        produce, there will probably be a number of worlds equipped
        with it.  As Star Viking activities expand, it is very
        likeley that traders operating in the wilds will find a
        demand for this type of weapon.

        Several adventure plotlines are possible around this weapon;
        one which suggests itself to me is probably obvious.  The
        players (RCES or \'Lancers) attempt a smash-n-grab on some
        TL-5 to TL-7 dictator.  They expect an easy time of it.

        Pull this one on your players after they\'ve done two or three
        of the same type of missions in a row and have had a chance
        to get overconfident and complacent.  Suprise them with the
        weapon; without the DS ammunition, it shouldn\'t be too
        deadly, but should (if employed well) be able to prevent
        the PCs from accomplishing some or all of their objectives.

        Drive home to them in a practical sort of way how difficult
        their lives would be if lots of worlds had them.  Later
        developments in the campaign can involve efforts to stop
        free traders from spreading the guns (or the designs)
        around the area.  Another one might have to do with
        discovering that someone is producing DS ammunition.


The gun as shown above was later re-computed by Loren Wiseman to match
the design rules in FF&S as published (the design above was done to the
FF&S playtest rules which I had recieved), and the figures were rounded
for publication in \'Path of Tears\' and the \'RC Equipment Guidebook\'.

The credit for the design is missing from the \'Path of Tears\' sourcebook
due to a failure of internal communications at GDW.  It was noticed and
corrected in time to be credited in the \'RC Equipment Guidebook\'.

I urge everyone who is using the "Crunch Gun" in their campaigns to take
advantage of the real-world figures above, and change the weight and bulk
of the weapon to a more realistic figure.

great idea. except that it violates the second law of thermodynamics.
you are turning low-grade heat into useful energy, and decreasing entropy.
not to mention that the amount of energy the globe would have to absorb
would be enormous. we are talking about a lot of molecules travelling rather
rapidly..

Along the lines of the guns thread, let me put forth a design I did
for something which is in progress (no more details lest it spoil any
suprises...).


BFG-2070-B (TL 10 superheavy ACR)
Fires the 20x70ETCPC cartridge with Ea=90,000J
Dam=20 Pen=2-2-2 (Ball) 1-1-1 (Ds) Range=300/600/1200/2400
Recoil: SS:1 3:3 5:3 10:6
Empty mass: 21.5kg
113cm hvy bbl=3.4kg
Reciever: Crystaliron, 0.3125 of "base" wt ( (2/8)/(8/10) )
Mass=14.2 kg
Explosive Power Generator CPC HPG built into firing chamber
Bayonet Lug, Grenade Adapter, Long Muzzle Brake, SA stock, Gyro Comp,
Image Enhancement Scope, Laser Sight
Cost: Cr16,830 single

Ammo: 20 round magazine is 0.3kg empty, 4.8kg full
Ball ammo is Cr 4.94/shot
DS ammo is Cr9.34/shot


Note that two rule modifications and one rule bend (maybe) are included
in the above weapon.  Modification #1 is an allowance for hi-tech materials
in the reciever... basically, assume that the FF&S recievers are all steel,
and use the armor material hardness tables and such to work from there
to higher strength receivers.  Modification #2 is to assume that ETC
hand weapons use the same input energy requirement calculation as ETC
cannons do, which in this case ups the weapon mass (due to the big
honking cartridges...).  The rule bend (maybe) is that the input energy
is generated by putting a Explosive Power Generator/HPG built in to
the firing chamber and the cartridges being built into the ammo...
It\'s not documented as "legal", but it doesn\'t use any components which
aren\'t in the design tables, so it should be ok.  The result is that the
ammo mass is feasible rather than completely unreasonable.

Those having been made, just *look* at the weapon.  It\'s a man portable,
relatively lightweight (about 100 lbs loaded), controllable on full auto
*by an un-battledressed-human* light cannon.  It can punch through modern
APCs at range.  It will make mincemeat out of anyone\'s battledress at
extreme range.  Experienced troops can fire it full auto and hit things
with it at almost 2500 meters.

I don\'t know if this models the real world or not; I don\'t think anyone has
ever made a weapon of this nature in real life, so I don\'t know if the design
rules are accurate or not.  But the weapons capabilities obsolete nearly all
Imperial-standard hand weapons and armor.  It does use some rule mods, but
they are defensible based on the rest of FF&S.  The more I work on designs
for FF&S the more it amazes me how little GDW has officially explored the
implications of FF&S (you think handguns are bad, try tanks for a while...
every one GDW has published so far is so badly optimized that my 6-ton
MCr2 TL10 tanks can beat their 10 and 20 ton MCr16+ TL15 tanks when
mine are outnumbered).

Well, good goodies make the game more enjoyable, and *I* want goog goodies
too! Too bad the FF&S dfoesn\'t deliver what it promises; MT was better
overall for vehicle designs (including wet naval), and the only decent way
to deal with weapons is do real world stats.

3G3 is the single smothest design sequence I\'ve ever used. I used it
extensively with MT, gurps, and cyberpunk. My favorite weapon was a 2mm
10:1 hypervel smoothbore PISTOL, traveller TL 15 (3g3 tl 18!), caseless,
semi auto. weights 2-3 kilos, and throws the DU slug at mach 5+. It
converts well to MT,as it\'s damage is 3 versus an unarmoured target
(overpenetration) and it does 8 by concunssion to an armored target.

3g3 can be used to make such extreme weapons because it assumes propellants
will get more and more powerfull as the tech level increases. FF&S assumes
that no further developments occur after TL 11 or so (I\'m not looking it up
at the moment), and powder is the final answer. That, and the mass
factor/density of traveller weapons is way wrong. Puts the SG aroung 15 for
all weapons. Steel is only around 7.5. (don\'t quote 3g3 at me; it has some
errors, too, primarily for simplicity; check Perry\'s ChemEngr\'s Hndbk)

Something was itching and I went and looked at a couple of sources...
The initial quote, from one regency ground forces commander talking
about (presumably) his command vehicle, the Thunderbolt, has quite
a historical precedence.

The "Thunderbolt" was the name of the tank that later-to-be Maj. Gen.
Abrams commanded in WW II; later, after Gen Abrams sheperded the M-1
tank through the US procurement system (and then retired), the vehicle
was officially named after him (As a type), and the first M-1 delivered
was named the "Thunderbolt" as an individual vehicle nickname to additionally
honor Gen Abrams.

I will avoid comment on the sillyness of having a comment about Maggart
in the Regency book, but the Thunderbolt reference makes some sense 8-)

It may be the SG.  Remember the snub pistol is TL8 FFS and TL11 3G^3.
So, there shouldn\'t be any problem with the power of the propellant.
I think that the big drawback in FFS is that it bases the energy of
the round on the size of the projectile, and doesn\'t factor in the
cartridge length.  So, a 10mm 2:1 (twice as long as it\'s diameter for
the non-3G^3 users) is just as powerful as a 3:1 or 1:1, even though
one cartridge obviously holds more powder and the other less.  As I
said, if I use the cartridge length in the equation for figuring out
the round\'s average energy, I get similar results.  Do you have any
idea what the real-world (tm) stats for similar ammunition would be?

How about as a treat for the holidays we whip up some weapons for
everyone to use?  8)

Let me know what you think; personally, I feel that 3G3 is considerably
better than FF&S, for those items that 3G3 covers.  FF&S is, quite
frankly, about an edition or two behind 3G3 - FF&S has promise, *IF*
GDW would put it though a couple of cycles of playtesting and revision.

FF&S and 3G3 use different values for propellant energy and gun efficency.
While it\'s debatable which is correct (though it\'s my feeling that 3G3\'s
values are a better fit over a broader range of TLs), the net result is that
given the same cartridge dimensions, you will arrive at different energies
in the two systems.

This gives you two choices:
1) Stick with the known dimensions, and just accept the different ranges,
   damage values, and penetrations; or
2) Use FF&S to figure out what the energies for the Traveller weapons
   *should* be, and then design 3G3 weapons to those energies, despite
   the differences in cartridge dimensions and other statistics.

Offhand, I\'d say you could probably do a lot worse than re-designing all
of the Traveller small arms with 3G3; at least then you\'d have an internally
consistent set of weapons for your game (as I recall, some ambitious soul
actually did this for MegaTraveller, and posted the results to the TML).

would be a fun, Traveller/Starship Troopers/Forever War sort of thing.
Problem is, it seems like it\'s light on science and heavy on feelings and
character interaction.  The show reminds me of nothing so much as a bad
World War II buddy movie with women and some odd references to people
raised via clone-like tech..

  On the other hand, the animation of the space battles looks pretty cool,
and seems fairly Traveller-like.  The one starship I saw up-close had the
manuever engines mounted out on pylons - very sensible, extra arm for
rotational moves.  The ground actions are more primitive than the space
tech - the troops look like they are wearing current USA field equipment
with a camera stuck on the helmet.

  Anyway, since I\'ve only seen a couple of whole shows, is it worth it to
try and catch it more often, or does it suck consistantly (I assume it
does since I haven\'t seen it mentioned here)?

I hadn\'t realized the Grav Tank was quite so under-armoured. Are the more
recent designs (Regency Equipment, etc.) that bad too?

How does the crunch gun compare to energy weapons now that they\'ve been
upgraded?

: Uh, what may I ask is 3G?

Guns! Guns! Guns!, Third edition (or 3G^3) for short is a weapons
design system put out by Blacksburg Tactical Research Center (BTRC).
Originally meant as a design system for BTRC\'s TimeLords game, it
expanded into a universal system.  It allows you to design weapons and
convert them from 3G^3 stats to (off the top of my head),
MegaTraveller, Twilight:2000, TORG, GURPS, Cyberpunk, CORPS,
TimeLords, and HERO.  It also contains notes on how to go about
converting to any other system.

The big plus is that it allows you to create a weapon and use it in
many games.  The big ones for us would be stuff like TNE, MT, and
GURPSify Traveller.

As a side note, it is currently being redrafted and a new printing
should be out in early 1996.  The only drawback is that the new
printing will not include the conversion notes for MT. 8(

I would also recommend getting it\'s companion piece More Guns!.  It
includes descriptions for over 500 weapons and conversion stats for
all of the aforementioned systems.  It also expands on the original
conversion notes presented in 3G^3.

And in case anyone is wondering, I have no affiliation with BTRC other
than being an absolutely satisfied customer.

I think what Dave Nielsen says at the beginning of the RVSB explains
everything.  To sum up, the TNE conversions tried to be faithful to
the original CT and MT incarnations of our favorite toys.
Unfortunately not everything is completely transferable between the
Striker/MT/FFS design sequences.

So, what are we to do?  Personally, I leave the designs alone.
There\'s no use picking on them when all they\'re trying to be is
historically accurate.

    'body' => 'I once ran a scenario where a group of "fifth column" Zhodani took over a
landed battle cruiser by getting into the bridge and turning on the Black
Globe while the thing was still landed.  This kept the outside forces off
their backs for a while (especially since they didn\'t want to just blow
the thing up with all their men still inside) and allowed the Zho\'s to try
to hijack the ship.  It made for an interesting scenario, with liquefied
atmosphere dropping like rain from the globe which was covered with oxygen
and nitrogen frost.

I realize the scenario has some logical flaws, but boy was it neat!  I\'m
not sure how much energy there would be in the air and dirt immediately
adjacent to the globe, but I assumed that the capacitors of a large
warship could take it for at least a while.  Also, regarding the idea that
the globe would blow up if anything large hits it, I always assumed that
it was taking in the kinetic energy of the body and that only the matter
adjacent to the globe would transmit heat to it in the short term.  Over
time, depending on the nature of the object hitting the globe, all the
heat would get sucked out of it, but this would depend on how fast heat
was trasmitted through the matter itself.

On the obverse, I\'m interested in what worlds *have* been extensively
detailed in Traveller.  Anyone cares to take a look?

(Musingly) One Christmas Day, I\'ll recieve a shiny new CD-ROM from GDW,
containing ALL information concerning Traveller in one, easy-to-browse
location.   Every world, every alien, every sector, every ship: all
hyperlinked, too!

Interesting design.  For a real world model, I would say that no army would
field this weapon as the standard weapon of unpowered infantry.  A loaded
weight of 43.9kg is far to heavy a weapon to wield effectively.  Toss on a
few mag\'s of ammo, say 4 more @ 4.8kg =  19 kg, and the rest of his field
load, maybe 15kg tops, and you have an infantryman weighing 48 + 19 + 15 =
78kg (about his own body weight) with a very minimalist load.  And this
doesn\'t count what he would carry in his rucksack, things like socks,
ammunition, food, water, ammunition, sleeping bag/blankets/shelter half,
ammunition, etc.

On the plus side, if you put a bipod on it and give it to a fire-team, it
would make an excellent platoon support weapon.  If you could develop some
kind of HE, HEAT, and flechette round for it, that would round out it\'s
support weapon role nicely.  Imagine group three or four of these together
in a company assault, armed with a mix of HE and flechette going against
lightly armoured vehicles and infantry.  There would be much wailing and
gnashing of teeth on the receiving end.

20 percent miss.  For you,...well, by the sound of things, I don\'t think it\'s

Hi All.

>>>>>>>>>>
  I\'m curious if anyone else has been watching this show.  It\'s been on
the Fox network on Sundays before The Simpsons (my favorite 1/2 hour of
TV), so I\'ve watched a few episodes.  When I saw the ads, I thought it
would be a fun, Traveller/Starship Troopers/Forever War sort of thing.
Problem is, it seems like it\'s light on science and heavy on feelings and
character interaction.  The show reminds me of nothing so much as a bad
World War II buddy movie with women and some odd references to people
raised via clone-like tech..
<<<<<<<<

I\'ve been nursing this show since the beginning, hoping it would
get better.  I\'ve found that most SF shows need at least a year or so to
get their bearings (e.g., B5 and all the new Star Treks).  So I\'m
to give it a chance.  I admit that it\'s a little soap opera-ish, but so
are the Star Trek shows.  Some of the episodes have been more combat oriented
and less devoted to ham-handed so-called character development.  The clone
types are an interesting concept involving soldiers developed in vitro.  I
like the fact that they are not presented as super-soldiers, but merely
good normal-human stock. This makes more sense biologically as well as
socio-culturally.

  On the other hand, the animation of the space battles looks pretty cool,
and seems fairly Traveller-like.  The one starship I saw up-close had the
manuever engines mounted out on pylons - very sensible, extra arm for
rotational moves.  The ground actions are more primitive than the space
tech - the troops look like they are wearing current USA field equipment
with a camera stuck on the helmet.
<<<<<<<

The space combat is definately the best aspect, they even have
quasi-vector-like movement (though ships still stupidly do barrel rolls
and other wasteful things).  The ships have a very good "rivets and
plates" look to them which I like.  I disagree with you about the ground
stuff.  I like the "primitive" look.  It makes a sort of sense since the
show\'s premise is that Terrans are new to the game and have just
developed their off-planet military capabilities.

  Anyway, since I\'ve only seen a couple of whole shows, is it worth it to
try and catch it more often, or does it suck consistantly (I assume it
does since I haven\'t seen it mentioned here)?
<<<<<<<

I would recommend giving it a chance. I think you may have caught
some of the poorer episodes.  Some of them are closer to the Starship
Troopers sort of thing.  On the other hand, if you\'re looking for good
acting, give it up.  They\'ve picked a bunch of nobodies for actors, and
it\'s obvious why they\'re nobodies.
I tend to watch all the SF I can on TV as a way of supporting it.
I\'m going to give it a chance.  It\'s certainly better in terms of
Traveller stuff than anything else on TV (with the possible exception of
B5).  In my opinion, all the Star Trek series took at least a year to get
past the stage where you wince at least twice every episode from
watching bad acting/writing/etc.

Of course, the above is merely my humble opinion.  I was wondering why
this show hasn\'t gotten mention on the list.  Don\'t you people get Fox?

Even for the mass public "Space: Above and Beyond" (SAAB) is REAL bad.  My
Ten top reasons/questions (I\'m embarrassed to say I\'ve watched this 4
times.  My main excuse is I wonder why I\'m not a tech advisor making 6
figures on just an OK Sci Fi TV series) are:
1) How much money did they save by not hiring a military advisor for the
script--let alone a physics graduate student as a science advisor.
2) On Sunday\'s, show a "Vitro", who even spent most of his life on the
lamb, didn\'t know what Christmas was.  Did he really live on Earth, let
alone the US--even 100 years from now?
3) Why is there a Saratoga?  It appears that there was no other space
capable .military--precontact.  Why build it?
4) The "58th" has about a dozen LTs and a Major.  Where are the Captains,
let alone the enlisted men?
5) What about grav plates?  When they lose their power they still have gravity.
6) The 2060\'s look more like the 1980\'s than what I envision the 2010\'s will be.
7) Why are fighter pilots used as infantry?
8) Where is every other nations\' on Earth forces?
9) Why do fighters bank in vacuum?
10) Why do you catapult fighters in space?

    'body' => 'After reading the gun thread in this mailing list, I checked
the military smallarm requirements from a MATINE paper
(MATINE = Defense Technical Committee of Finland).

When I compared these requirements with those weapons
presented in Reformation Coalition Equipment Guide, I noticed
that almost all those weapons would be considered unsuitable
of "borderline cases" for military smallarms. The main reason
for this is that RCEG weapons are too heavy.

As a rule of thumb, the (loaded) mass of modern military
smallarms should be with the following limits:

Sidearm (pistol):               1 kg, 1.5 km maximum
Personal Defense weapon (SMG):  3 kg, 4 kg maximum
Basic weapon (Assault rifle):   4 kg, 5 kg maximum
Sniper rifle (Anti-personnel):  5 kg, 8 kg maximum
Squad support weapon (LMG, GL): 6 kg, 10 kg maximum

Note that sufficiently low mass is only one of the
requirements, and the most important requirement is that
there must be a specific reason why a new weapon is needed.


The design rules in FFS assume that all weapons are made of
the same materials. However, it is possible to design lighter
weapons by using optional material rules. These design ideas
were presented in "Materials of Weapons" article in TML-118.


Design example: The following weapon is used in my TNE
campaign. The basic reason why this weapon was needed was
that it could fire a low-tech (TL-7) HMG ammo that was found
in stockpiles in a captured enemy supply dump.

----

12.7x99mm Heavy Automatic Rifle (SAKO 12.7 RasKiv)

Manufactured by SAKO in Vyborg/Capella/Solomani Rim, this heavy
rifle is a high-tech replica of ancient Barrett Light .50
bullpup. Most .50 calibre rifles are too heavy and unbalanced
to be fired without a bipod, but this rifle is build into
"over-the-shoulder" bullpup configuration, which allows it to
be fired from any position. In practice this means that the
pistol grip is placed in the front of the magazine well,
shoulder-rest is placed just behind the magazine well, and the
long receiver frame goes over the shoulder.

In this particular design, the part of the receiver that goes
behind the firer weights 4.34 kg, which is 40% of the weight of
a loaded rifle.

(Note: "over-the-shoulder" bullpup is sometimes called "bazooka
configuration", because the rifle is shouldered in a similar
way as a light rocket launcher.)

The weapon is designed to fire ancient Solomani TL-7 12.7x99mm
round, which is still manufactured in large quantities in some
low-tech worlds. 12.7x99mm round is also called .50 Browning
Machine Gun.

Only Ball and DS ammunition are manufactured, because TL-7 HE
and HEAP rounds do not offer any increase of performance.

Historically 12.7x99mm ball rounds are called ".50 BMG", and DS
rounds are called ".50 SLAP" (Saboted Light Armor Piercing).

While this rifle is 190 cm long (bulk 12), only
150 cm (bulk 10) of this is in the front of the
firer, and the remaining 40 cm goes over the

these "Vitros" are just plain dumber than rocks.

I think it is a fun Starship Trooper sort of thing.

In a small nutshell, there is an alien race that bushwhacked the outer
few interstellar colonies of  Earth (in 2063).  No warning, no nothing.
The PCs - uh, main characters, are USMC space fighter pilots forming the
core of the 58th Fighter Squadron.  In the 1st episode, they shrank from
12 to 5 while stopping a nasty attack in the Sol system.  They get a few
replacements each week; this week was the first week the replacements
(redshirts) did not all die off.

The Navy and Marines are working as part of a UN force - but we have never
seen or heard of units from any other nation. (Come on, how expensive is
hiring someone with an English accent to be a radio contact?).

TL is more akin to 2300 than to Traveller.  So is the feel.

The bad guys (Chigs) are stomping us pretty bad.  They have friends who are
androids (much like replicants from BladeRunner) who revolted about 10 years
ago and fled into space and apparently are good buddies with the Chigs.  I
guess because actors in a little makeup are cheaper than making more than
two full alien suits (I\'ve seen no more than two of them at a time).

>Problem is, it seems like it\'s light on science and heavy on feelings and
>character interaction.

Not to mention light on military science, too.

The characters were trained as space-fighter pilots (USMC, yet).  And yet, they
are often used as groundpounders.  A stray bullet is a cheap way for the Chigs
(aliens) to remove a pilot whose training cost millions of $ :-).

Not to mention explaining interstellar travel.  They have from time to time
mentioned temporary worm holes (as in the fleet is waiting for one so they
can use it move to another system) - but then have such silliness as "drifting
into another system" with no explanation of sliding between stars.

Now, now, the show is on at 7PM on Sunday.  Read as juvenile/family audience.

OK, so they created their own minority (one character is a cloned human, one
of a set mass-reporiduced to fight the androids mentioned above; every 2
episodes, they make some reference to that (usually in peculiarities and lack of
social graces the fellow has since he grew up sans family); every four, it
is the focus of the adventure.

OK, so they do things that make little military sense.

But...

The weapons themselves are slightly upgraded.  The ground combat sequences
are rather well-done.  They certainly capture the very confusing nature of a
fire fight.

As my comments show, I have some ambivalent feelings about it.  I like it, but it
has problems.  The pilot episode was excellent, but I don\'t think it has lived up to
its potential.  Script quality is uneven - some are quite good; some are below the
quality of the Rat Patrol (but I liked the Rat Patrol when I was 10).  I think its a bit
violent for the under 15 crowd, and a bit uneven in quality for the above 15
crowd.

OTOH, I DO make the effort to catch it as often as possible, for all its
problems.

Actually, I like the show.  We don\'t get B5 here, but I saw the pilot and
liked it as well.

I find the military infrastructure to be what I would expect if it were to
happen in the near future.  It is a near mirror of the infrastructure
currently in place, though I am bothered that Marine Aviators are sent in
for ground grunt work, and that a bunch of 2LT\'s are working together
instead of leading their own squads.  Now if you look at them as not
aviators, but as Marine Special Forces, with aviation abilties, it does get
to be a lot stronger.  I think if they included a bunch of privates and
such, where each of the main characters were in charge of each squad, or
manipulate them into positional roles (communications officer, helmsman, etc
(which they also seem to be doing) then the layout begins to hold more water.

The show is about as good a war show as I have seen since Black Sheep
Squadron. Truth be told, every marine is a trained infantry-person. All of
them. Even the fighter jocks.

As for the 58th having too many chiefs and not enuf injuns, remember that
ALL US Fighter pilots are officers. The deck crews, repair crews, etc are
enlisted (I\'ve seen em in both USMC and Navy chevrons on the show.)

The problem is that they are using a WWII marine corps aviation model; for
a squadron from a bunch of raw pilots and give them an experienced
commander.

As for the Saratoga: It seems to be laid out fairly well, but they still
haven\'t mentioned artificial gravity, which it obviously has. Same goes for
the LCV\'s! In the cristmas episode, they wind up on minimal power, and
still have gravity. Hmmm.

As for the other nations, we don\'t see or hear any other nations, but they
might have the different nationalities working different lanes of approach.

As for drifiting into another system, they might be referring to different
planet-moon systems armound the same star, or possible be talking about
binary systems or trinary systems.

Yes, it is space opera. Yes, it needs a science advisor. Yes, they should
be taking the maintenance crew with them on dirtside "grunt" missions, as
the maint crew are no more and no less expendable than the fighter jocks.

looking like today with spaceships. This shouldn\'t be the case, so I\'ve
been wondering what the effect of having gravitic technology around for
a few hundred years would have on peoples daily lives. We already got
air/rafts and grav belts. Capitol is (was?) an entire complex suspended
in mid-air. FGMPs have a gravitic recoil device. What else?

How small/cheap/low-powered can an anti-grav device be produced? I remember
from somewhere seeing an illustration of a starship common area. There
were hanging plants and light fixtures floating in air, implying some kind
of lift plate or other anti-grav device. Would anti-grav be common and cheap
enough to be used in plant vases and lamps?

What kind of throw-away descriptions would this add to the flavor of the
game? Do engineers have floating work lights? Anti-grav, always close to hand
toolboxes? Would luggage be essentially weightless when carried, or would it
float behind you? Would there be hands-free umbrellas that hovered just
overhead? Would "no visible means of support bras" need batteries?

If anti-grav is commonplace, what kind of adventure seeds does that suggest?
A PC locked up in prison jury-rigs some industrial-sized lighting fixtures
and makes a dangerous escape, maybe? Floating over prison walls on an
improvised air/raft? What would high-security areas look like, if that
was possible? A lot of sensors, or a really, really big razor wire canopy?

Just some random thoughts before the holiday vacation. If there\'s anyone
interested in designing something other than small arms over the break,
there\'s a few suggestions.

Hi,
I have watched this show and a few answers, and a few questions of my own.

1)I wish that they would get a few GOOD advisors on board.
2)The Vitro is three years old, and skipped his classes at the center
on history/culture.  He was a trouble maker and was sent to the Corp
by a judge.
3)We humans carried our past into space, remember that in 2060 there
are still nations and wars, only this threat got the world together.
4)I see the 58th as a flight wing made up of just the pilots, the rest
are assigned in a different command, much like a current aircraft
carrier which will rotate the flight wing out but the rest keep on
working with the ship.
5)They never said in the show that they lost all power, power was
reduced and they did shut down equipment to conserve power.  They were
out of thruster power which is used to turn the spacecraft, notice
that the main engines were operational and were nuke in design.
6)No comment.
7)This does not make sense to me either, the Saratoga has army special
forces on board for ground pounders.
8)I think that the nations are outfitting their own warships and only
join in fleets.
9)No comment.
10)If you just dropped them out the door and the Saratoga was under
power you might have them hit the ship, sensor, probe, antenna, and
get to near the main drives.  You catapult them out to clear the ship
and its drives, not to get them up to flying speed.
11)Why do the fighters seperate?
12)Why does the captain risk his ship so often?
13)Why does the Saratoga have to have close firefights, a long range
missile fight would be more correct.

There are many mistakes on the show and the only reason I watch is to
get a SF fix.

I think now that they must have a old retired wet sailer advising
them, someone so out of date .....

Well thanks,

        Actually Santa must have access to quite good weaponry.

        According to the original story of Santa Calus (not the
        new one that has been marketed to US, first by Coca Cola
        company, later by Disney), the home of Santa (actually
        St. Nicolaus) is at Korvatunturi (North-East Finland).

        Korvatunturi ("Fell Ear") is at the border area between
        Finland and Russia, and about 2/3 of this fell is at
        Russian side.

        As Santa and his helpers (called "Tonttu" in finnish)
        have held the Korvatunturi for last few centuries, they
        mush have some pretty impressive weaponry. The pressure
        at Korvatunturi must be increasing continuously, because
        those russian soldiers that have been pulled back from
        Baltia are now being massed near Finland\'s border, and
        that area has now probably the highest concentration of
        weaponry in the world.

        Note: "Tonttu" is "Gnome" in english. The reason why
        these guys are called "elves" is just crappy
        translation job.

anyone seen anything with on TV or in movies (besides 2001 and 2010) with
realistic space flight?  I don\'t think you can say that B5\'s space combat
is any more realistic.  Anything being done at visual range is really kind
of silly, but you\'ve got to do it or it gets boring to look at (though I
think with really good writers you could swing it, the public just
wouldn\'t _get_ realistic space flight and combat).  
	In terms of B5 being a much better show, this is true, but only in
recent years (IMO).  The first season or two (BB, or "Before Boxlietner")
were quite iffy to say the least.  This sort of thing has been true of
every SF show on the tube.  I think compared to ST:TNE and its brethren
(AKA S&S or "Soap Operas & Space Anomalies"), this is a much better show. 
They need to work out some kinks, and concentrate on space combat more. 
The idea of the pilots being ground forces could be excused on several
grounds which others have noted, and I don\'t really care about "military 
structure" accuracy anyway. Lots can change in 60 years or so.
	 I actually think their treatment of "Vat Soldiers" is really well
done.  The idea that they would have stunted social skills meshes well
with the total lack of socialization they would recieve while being
"grown".  I also like the idea that they are not too "super-human".  It
really isn\'t that easy to mess with the human genome, and it\'s not
necessary if you can just produce oodles of average-joe soldiers (with 
20/20 vision and other basics taken care of by selection).  There\'s also 
the problem (politically) of creating a "superior race".  The fact that 
some of them resent being created just to die for normal humans makes 
sense to me too (_I\'d_ be pissed off!).
	That having been said, the show does get a little too 
touchy-feely at times, but hopefully they will remedy this in the coming 
season.

Well, for the most part, much Anti-grav technology is designed to lift
large payloads (or at least man sized payloads) but the use of smaller
technology for simpler low weight devices has a lot of potential.

One use was suggested by the movie Dune. (I don\'t recall reading about
it in the book, but I may be wrong)  There lights (presumably supported
by antigrav) would hover behind a person from a nice distance up, providing
soft spot light illumination wherever ehty went.  (Like some special
golf carts will do today.)  In the same book/movie, the Baron was 
extreemely overweight, in part because antigrav units kept the heart
from having to worry about all that fat.

Anti-grav seats, which don\'t actually keep you in the air but greatly
reduce the stress of going from a standing position to a seated one
on the legs, esp with the elderly, would be easy. Anti-grav eat in bed
tables can also be popular, and the weights here are also small.

On spaceships, low gravity areas might be interesting.  I recall an
interesting article with involved large scale space cities, where
the central area, contained a low gravity swimming pool.  (Hey
There, no splashing the water into the zero g area!)  But that was
based on a centripital gravity system which would graduate the
further down the radius you went, which is different from Anti-grav.

Star Trek, made popular the anti-grav-don\'t-get-a-hernia lifting
handles.  That is also a very important anti-grav development.

Ah well, just a few ideas from the top of my head.

That\'s easy.  There are still separate governments.  That\'s the USS Saratoga

had a similar premise for a UN conglomeration of vessels belonging to 
different nations ganging up on a common invader (Kafers).

Actually, that\'s a Lt Col - and a bunch of LTs.  There should be a Captain
or two
even in a brandy new squadron.  Not to mention that the fighter maintenance folk
should be USMC enlisted attached to the 58th. (not to mention the idiocy of

Most viewers would understand when fighters pivot, fire main engine, and then
start following a separate vector (curving path while the engine fires).
Star Wars

was going on in "Top Gun" :-)

>10) Why do you catapult fighters in space?
Separation. Vector addition. Fuel retention.

Yes, anti-grav or contra-grav makes a big difference. If I might draw an
analogy with AD&D, it\'s a bit like designing castles just like mediaeval
complexes and then remembering that in AD&D there are innumerable monsters
that can fly or burrow and magi who can teleport, create paths through 10\'
thick walls, etc...

i.e. yes, Traveller worlds which have heavy use of grav\' should be
appropriately different. Anywhere that criminals can have grav-belts, so
should the cops. Perhaps even window-cleaners for sky-scrapers!

However, there has to be a balance. I don\'t like too great a proliferation
of grav\' technology, partly because it is difficult to explain the
intricacies to the less technical players. Therefore I tend to limit grav\'
due to its cost. If you remember CT trav, the primary cost of an air/raft
(c. 500kCr?) was its grav gear; likewise a grav belt at 100kCr. Therefore I
averaged out grav tech as costing a minimum of about 50kCr for a base grav\'
module capable of supporting human weight. (I ought to compare this with the
lift ratings given in the CT Robots design book...) That would mean the
flower pot-suspension Steve mentioned in his post might cost several
thousand credits. Therefore it\'s the sort of posy thing that might be used
in yachts, fancy hotels, etc. but is never going to be seen in any
self-respecting spacers\' bar! Most of the time, the price difference between
grav\' and non-grav\' stuff will be such that normal citizens will go for
non-grav\'. It\'s handy but is it worth paying thousands of credits just to
save you carrying a box of tools?

However, I _do_ see big use in things like medecine where grav can help
disabled/injured people get around so much more easily.

Remember also that anti-grav\' takes power. And therefore requires batteries
as self-contained fusion plants, etc. do _not_ fit in anything smaller than
a backpack below TL14/15, in my campaign. (NB: Though the current research
into high voltage, \'high\' frequency power systems which are supposedly
releaseing \'Zero Point Energy\' and all this sort of thing might prove me
wrong sooner than some people expect - for the above, read "A bit like Cold
Fusion, but no one likes to talk about that at the moment").

Err, I think I\'ve been talking too long. Must mean it\'s my last day in work.

others have noted, the plots vary all over the place. 

I disagree *violently* with those who think that the space scenes are
ok. As a series of stills, or even short clips, they are ok. But
anything more than that and we have some *real* problems.

Item:	on the Saratoga, the decks are *parallel* to the thrust axis. 

Even *with* articifial gravity, this is not a wise design decision, as
if the grav plates go out the corridors become *long* shafts. <Crunch>
(The sound of anyone in the corridors hitting the end when the engines
fire:-) 

Item:	These single seat fighters made it from Earth to Jupiter orbit
	in *one* hop in the pilot.

Ok, that makes them *better* than any ship in CT or MT or TNE. This is
hard to justify even with Isp 100k to 1M "fusion rockets".

It\'s also hard to justify having a *single* vehicle that can take off
from a runway, fly into orbit, and then go multiple AU. You could build
it, but in the atmosphere or low orbit, it\'d be carrying too much
wasted mass in the extra fuel and life support (and the way too
powerful engines). In deep space, the wings are wasted mass.

Any rational military would have *seperate* Aerospace fighters and deep
space fighters. Each optimized for their specialized job. And such
fighter would eat these things for lunch in their own operating environments.

Item:	In the pilot, they are waiting for a Chig attack force that is
	on its way to attack earth. They are *specifically* mentioned
	as hiding in the Trojan asteroids. They can see Jupiter and
	some of its moons.  They are also able to conduct a running
	battle with the Chigs as they pass through.

The Trojans are two groups of asteroids. They are in Jupiter\'s L4 and
L5 positions. That is, they are 60 degrees ahead and 60 degrees behind
it in the same orbit. That means that they are as far from Jupiter as
Jupiter is from the Sun! So much for seeing Jupiter.

Now, let\'s consider that battle. They are at rest with respect to the
asteroids. The Chigs are on a course that will get them to earth in a
time period suitable for a long range fighter (ie hours, not days!). 

Yet the relative velocities are shown as being nearly the same. We have
the the Marines and the Chigs *dogfighting*!! Heck, the relative
velocities shown can\'t be more than a few hundred km per hour!

And of course, we have the fighters making "Star Wars" type manuevers.
Banking on turns, and other things that work with aircraft but not
spacecraft. 

Oh yeah, they are close enough to *see* each other (actually, we
repeatedly see fighters pass within *meters* of each other!). 

Believable? Hell, no! *Star Trek* pays more attention to getting things
right than this series does.

It\'s probably an outpost of some traders from the Imperium (The First 
Imperium, that is).  Explains all those goodies, the impossible 
round-the-world distribution, camoflauge so good it can\'t be seen from
either the ground or top-of-the line satilites, and it\'s military security.

All those \'elves\' are obviously Droyne, who use their psionic powers to 
find out who\'se been naughty or nice.

Antti Lahtinen, since you\'re Traveller\'s nearest representative to 
our Foregin Friends, could you somehow communiate season\'s greetings? 
Without getting yourself shot in the process, of course.

I\'ve finally got around to updating the planet generation system I first
posted here a couple of years ago. Besides minor changes to the star and
planet mechanics, I\'ve added systems for generating colonies and
intelligent species.

I\'m working on a set of programs for automatic generation of stars,
planets, colonies, and aliens; they should be ready early in the new year.

1. INTRODUCTION
----

This is a reasonably quick and simple system for generating complete
planetary systems in rough detail, and the most interesting planets in
somewhat greater detail. It also includes a system for generating
intelligent life forms. It isn\'t tied to any particular game mechanics, and
should be usable with any SFRP system.

I designed it because I\'ve never been very impressed by the planet
generation schemes in most SF role-playing games, which are usually either
too unrealistic or too complicated (or, frequently, both). I wanted a
scheme that was simple enough to generate systems fairly quickly, while
still being designed by someone who knew one end of a Hertzsprung-Russell
diagram from the other (hint: neither end is likely to have anything
resembling Earth orbiting it).

You will need some six-sided and ten-sided or twenty-sided dice (or, of
course, a computer with a good random number function). I assume you\'re
familiar with the usual dice notation (so you know what something like
"2D6+3" means). This system requires rolls on D6, D10, D20, and D100.
Unless otherwise stated, all results of less than zero should be counted as
zero, and all fractional results should be rounded to the nearest whole
number (round halves upwards).

2. STAR SYSTEMS
----

In the local region of the Galaxy, there is about one star system per 600
cubic light-years. I suggest using cube-shaped sectors either 25 or 50
light-years on a side. A 25 light-year sector has 8D6-2 star systems
(average 26); a 50 light-year sector has 6D20+145 systems (average 208;
more appropriate to generation by a computer program than by hand). Place
the systems at random within the sector (roll D100/4 or D100/2 for each of
the X, Y, and Z coordinates).

To find the number of stars in a system, roll D100 on the following table:

    D100   Stars
    ----  ----
    1-40   1
    41-90  2
    91-99  3
    100    4

Stars are classified into seven "spectral types", based on their
temperature and colour. The types are O (blue), B (blue-white), A (white),
F (yellow-white), G (yellow), K (orange), and M (red); astronomers use the
mnemonic "Oh, Be A Fine Girl, Kiss Me" to remember the sequence. The seven
types are each divided into ten subclasses, indicated by a digit from 0 to
9 after the spectral type (except type O, which is normally divided only
into subclasses 5 to 9). The Sun, for example, is type G2.

A Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is a plot of stars with spectral type on the
horizontal axis and luminosity on the vertical axis. The majority of stars
fall into the "main sequence", which runs roughly diagonally, from bright,
blue-white O-type stars at the top left of the diagram to dim M-type red
dwarfs at the bottom right, with yellow dwarfs like the Sun falling almost
exactly in the middle. Other types of stars are above or below the main
sequence.

Red giants (indicated by a "g" prefix on the spectral type, e.g. "gM5") and
supergiants (indicated by a "c" prefix, e.g. "cK0") are late stages in the
life cycle of massive stars. White dwarfs (indicated by a "D" prefix, e.g.
"DA"), much dimmer than most main sequence stars, are the final stage in
the evolution of most stars. The most massive stars will end up as neutron
stars or black holes (these have no spectral types; the tables below use
"NS" and "BH" to represent them).

For each star in a system, roll D100 (one to three times) on the following
table, to get the general description and the specific spectral class of
the star. A subclass number should also be generated for main sequence and
giant stars (white dwarfs are not usually given a subclass).

The stars in a system should be listed in descending order of luminosity.
Take the basic groups in order (supergiants, giants, main sequence, white
dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes); within each group, list stars in order
of spectral type.

Many astronomical references use a more detailed system of "luminosity
classes", which run from I (supergiants) to VII (white dwarfs). This level
of detail is probably unnecessary for gaming. If you\'re using a star
catalogue that uses this system, you can convert the full luminosity
classes to the broad classes I\'ve used here using the following table.

    Luminosity class               Description
    ----  ----
    I                              Supergiant
    O-A II, F II-III, G-M II-IV    Giant
    O-A III-VI, F IV-VI, G-M V-VI  Main sequence
    VII                            White dwarf


3. PLANETARY SYSTEMS
----

Refer to the following table to generate the number of planets for each
star. First determine whether there are any planets; for multiple star
systems, roll only once for the whole system, using the spectral type of
the primary star. If the result is affirmative, generate the number of
planets for each star, based on the star\'s own spectral type.

    Star                     Spectral  Probability  Number of
    type                     class     of planets   planets

    Main sequence            O-B       10%          D10
    ...                      A         50%          D10
    ...                      F-G       99%          2D6+3
    ...                      K         99%          2D6
    ...                      M         50%          D6
    White dwarf              All       10%          D6/2
    Neutron star/black hole  All       5%           D6/2

Planetary systems are divided into three zones; different types of planet
will tend to form in each zone. Zone A is the inner or hot zone; zone B is
the intermediate or life zone; and zone C is the outer or cold zone (in our
system, Mercury and Venus are in zone A, Earth and Mars are in zone B, and
the asteroids and outer planets are in zone C). The following table
indicates which planets are in each zone for main sequence, giant, and
supergiant stars; all planets of white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black
holes are considered to be in zone C.

    Total    Planets in   Planets in   Planets in
    planets  zone A       zone B       zone C
    ----  ----  ----  ----
    1-3      --           Planet 1     Planets 2+
    4-5      Planet 1     Planet 2     Planets 3+
    6-7      Planet 1     Planets 2-3  Planets 4+
    8+       Planets 1-2  Planets 3-4  Planets 5+

At this point, if the star is a member of a multiple system, remove the
outermost D6+1 planets (this may leave the star with no planets). Determine
the planetary zones before deleting planets.

For each planet, three parameters are determined: type, size, and number of
moons. Roll D100 and refer to the following table for planet type, then
generate the size and moons.

    Earthlike [*2] --      91-100  --      (2D6+5)x1000  D6xD6/10

    [*1: Count as "cold" if the star is a white dwarf, neutron star, or
    black hole.]

    [*2: Count as "hostile" if the star is anything other than a main
    sequence star of type F, G, or K.]

Asteroids: A collection of rocks that never combined to form a planet.
Usually there will be a handful of large asteroids a few hundred kilometres
across, and a vast number of smaller objects.

Giant: A huge planet consisting mainly of hydrogen, ranging from ten to a
thousand times the Earth\'s mass. Example: Jupiter.

Rock: A small, rocky planet with no atmosphere. Example: Mercury.

Cold: A small planet with no atmosphere, composed mainly of ice; found only
in the outer part of a system. Example: Pluto.

Desert: Comparable in size to Earth, but with a barren surface and a thin,
inert atmosphere. Example: Mars.

Hostile: Comparable in size to Earth, with an atmosphere containing no (or
a negligible amount of) oxygen, but possibly with some other active
component. Hostile planets may occasionally have native life forms, but
they will be based on a very non-Earthlike biochemistry. Example: Venus.

Marginal: Almost Earthlike, with oxygen in the atmosphere, but with some
serious problem that makes it an unpleasant place to live, such as very
high or low temperature, atmospheric pressure, or oxygen level; traces of
some toxic gas in the atmosphere; dangerous volcanic activity; or high
radiation level. No examples in our solar system.

Earthlike: Oxygen atmosphere, temperatures not too far outside the human
comfort zone, and a reasonably stable surface. Note that the presence of
oxygen in the atmosphere necessarily implies the presence of life (oxygen
is too reactive to occur in large amounts from geological processes alone,
and would disappear in a relatively short time if life were to become
extinct). Example: Earth.

The details of a system\'s planets can be conveniently written using the
initial letter of the planet type, the size in thousands of kilometres, and
a dot followed by the number of moons, if any. Asteroid belts are simply
indicated by an "A" with no numbers (and are not counted towards the
"official" number of planets). Use slashes to mark the zone boundaries.
Here are some examples, using our solar system and an imaginary one
generated for Alpha Centauri.

4. EARTHLIKE AND MARGINAL PLANETS
----

4.1. PHYSICAL DETAILS

Generate a planet\'s orbit period using the table below, dependent on the
spectral type of its sun. If there are two Earthlike or marginal planets
orbiting the same star, generate two periods and assign them in the correct
order (the inner planet, obviously, gets the shorter period). If the outer
period is less than 25% more than the inner one, generate both of them
again.

    Star type  Orbit period
               (Earth days)
    ----  ----
    F0-F4      (2D100x3)+600
    F5-F9      (2D100x2)+400
    G0-G4      2D100+270
    G5-G9      2D100+150
    K0-K4      D100+120
    K5-K9      D100+70

To find the planet\'s rotation period, roll D100, add 10 for each moon, add
10 if the planet orbits a K-type star, and refer to the following table.

    Result   Rotation
    ----  ----
    1-65     D20+9 hours
    66-90    D20+20 hours
    91-98    D10 days
    99-103   D100 days
    104-150  D10 days

Roll D6/2+3 (keep fractions, don\'t round) for the planet\'s density in grams
per cubic centimetre. Multiply diameter by density and divide by 70000 to
calculate the surface gravity in Earth gravities (round to the nearest
0.1).

Roll 2D6-4 for Earthlike planets, or D10+D6-6 for marginal planets, and
multiply by 5 to find the average surface temperature in degrees Celsius
(negative numbers should be retained here, not counted as zero). If a star
has two planets in zone B and both of them are Earthlike or marginal, make
sure the temperatures are in the right order; the outer planet should have
a temperature no higher than the inner one (greenhouse effects and similar
phenomena can affect a planet\'s temperature, but not by all that much on a
planet with an approximately Earthlike atmosphere). If the outer planet\'s
temperature comes out higher, either swap them around (if the planets are
both Earthlike or both marginal) or generate both temperatures again (if
there is one of each).

Use the following table to determine the proportion of the planet\'s surface
covered by dry land, water, and ice. Roll dice for the water and ice areas
(count less than zero as zero, more than 100% as 100%); the land area is
whatever remains. If the water and ice areas add up to more than 100%, roll
both again.

    Average       Water        Ice
    temperature   area         area
    ----  ----  ----
    -20 to -10 C  (D10-5)x5 %  (D10+10)x5 %
    -5 to 5 C     (D20-5)x5 %  D10x5 %
    10 to 20 C    (5D6-8)x5 %  (D6-2)x5 %
    25 to 35 C    (5D6-8)x5 %  (D6-3)x5 %
    40 to 50 C    (5D6-8)x5 %  (D6-4)x5 %

If the land and water percentages are both greater than zero, the oceans
are assumed to be salt water (unless the planet has the "freshwater oceans"
special feature; see below). If the land percentage is zero, any oceans
will be fresh water (salt reaches the ocean through runoff from the land;
if there\'s no land, there\'s no salt).

A planet\'s mineral resources are measured on an arbitrary scale, running
from 1 (worst) to 100 (best). The Earth is rated 80, fairly high, because
of its high density (implying a relatively high ratio of metal to rock),
and its active volcanic and tectonic processes (which carry minerals from
deep in the interior to the surface). A planet\'s mineral resources rating
is generated by the formula:

    Minerals = (Diameter / 500) + (Density x 10) + (D100 / 2) - 45


4.2. BIOLOGICAL DETAILS

Roll D100 on each of the following tables to determine the evolutionary
level of the local life forms, and their chemical basis.

    D100                  Level of development
    Earthlike  Marginal
    ----  ----  ----
    --         1          No life
    1-10       2-30       I: Single-celled organisms only
    11-20      31-45      II: Simple invertebrates and plants (in seas)
    21-30      46-60      III: Advanced invertebrates and plants (on land)
    31-40      61-75      IV: Simple vertebrates (fish, amphibians)
    41-100     76-100     V: Advanced vertebrates (reptiles, birds, mammals)

If you get the "No life" result, life must have become extinct fairly
recently by geological standards, or the oxygen in the atmosphere would
have combined with surface materials and disappeared (it\'s difficult to say
how long this would take -- perhaps a few million years). The extinction
was probably caused by nuclear war or an astronomical disaster such as an
asteroid strike or a nearby supernova.

    D100                 Biochemistry

    81-100     61-99     Carbon-based
    --         100       Non-carbon-based

For simplicity, the many possible varieties of biochemistry are divided
into four broad classes.

Earthlike: Essentially the same chemical basis as Earth\'s life forms, with
only small differences, if any. Plants and animals with Earthlike
biochemistry can often be safely eaten by humans (and vice versa).

Protein-based: Similar to Earth life in its basic chemical components, but
with enough differences to make the biochemistries incompatible. Life of
this type will nearly always be inedible, and frequently poisonous, to
humans.

Carbon-based: Based on the same elements as Earth life, but arranged in
very different compounds. Always inedible, and usually extremely poisonous.

Non-carbon-based: Completely different to Earth\'s biochemistry in every
way. Invariably poisonous. Very rare, at least on anything resembling an
Earthlike planet.


4.3. SPECIAL FEATURES

There is no such thing as a typical Earthlike planet; every world is
unique. To reflect this, some Earthlike or marginal planets will have one
or more "special features" that are not covered by the usual planetary
parameters. Roll a D100 three times on the following table to determine
what the features are. If you get the same result (other than "No special
feature") twice, roll again.

Most features are restricted to planets with certain properties (for
example, the "Freshwater oceans" feature obviously requires an ocean
percentage greater than zero), or are incompatible with certain other
features (for example, a planet can\'t have both "High inclination" and "No
seasons"). Some features are sufficiently hazardous to human health that
they are restricted to marginal planets. See the detailed descriptions
below for explanations of the incompatibilities and prerequisites. If you
get an result incompatible with what you already know about the planet,
roll again.

ASTRONOMICAL FEATURES

Eccentric orbit: The planet\'s orbit is highly elliptical, producing
extremes of temperature at closest approach (periastron) and furthest
distance (apastron). Incompatible with "No seasons".

High inclination: The planet\'s axis is tilted by more than 45 degrees,
producing extreme temperature differences between summer and winter.
Incompatible with "No seasons".

High tides: A large, close moon or sun produces extremely high tides.
Requires either a K-type sun or at least one moon, and both land and water
areas to be non-zero.

Meteor storms: The planet suffers frequent meteor storms, often including
large asteroid or comet impacts, making the planet\'s surface a dangerous
place. Marginal planets only.

No seasons: The planet has close to zero axial inclination and orbital
eccentricity, so there are no seasonal effects. Requires a single star;
incompatible with "Eccentric orbit" or "High inclination".

Rings: The planet has a natural ring system.


GEOLOGICAL FEATURES

Radiation hazard: Radioactive minerals, or fallout from a nuclear war,
create a significant radiation hazard over large parts of the planet.
Marginal planets only.

Rugged terrain: The planet\'s land surface is almost entirely covered with
mountains and rough, rocky terrain, with practically no flat plains or
rounded hills. Requires a non-zero land area; incompatible with "Swampy
surface".

Volcanic activity: The planet has many active volcanos, enough to make life
dangerous over a large part of its surface. Marginal planets only.


HYDROGRAPHIC FEATURES

Freshwater oceans: The planet\'s oceans have very little salt in them,
either because they\'re geologically young or because some life form has
affected their composition. Requires both the land and water areas to be
non-zero. If the land area is zero and the water area is non-zero, this
feature is automatically present, independently of the special feature
rolls.

Many islands: The planet\'s land surface is broken up into a large number of
small islands, with no large continents. Requires both the land and water
areas to be non-zero.

Poisonous oceans: The oceans contain some contaminant or (more likely) life
form that makes the planet\'s sea water (and probably some of its fresh
water) poisonous to humans. Marginal planets only; requires a non-zero
ocean area.

Swampy surface: Most of the planet\'s land surface is low-lying and covered
with swamps, marshes, mud, quicksand, and so on. Requires a non-zero land
area; incompatible with "Rugged terrain".


ATMOSPHERIC FEATURES

Cloud cover: The planet has a permanent cloud cover over its entire
surface; it probably rains most of the time. Requires a temperature greater
than zero; incompatible with "Very thin atmosphere".

Toxic gas: The atmosphere contains some gas which is poisonous to humans,
making filter masks necessary. Marginal planets only.

Unstable climate: The climate undergoes severe and unpredictable changes
from year to year.

Very dense atmosphere: The atmosphere is dense enough to be unbreathable
without special respirator equipment, except perhaps on very high
mountains. Marginal planets only; incompatible with "Very thin atmosphere".

Very thin atmosphere: The atmosphere is too thin to breathe without special
respirator equipment, except perhaps in very deep valleys. Marginal planets
only; incompatible with "Cloud cover" or "Very dense atmosphere".


BIOLOGICAL FEATURES

Intelligent life: The planet has a native sentient life form, which may or
may not have advanced technology. Requires at least level III life;
incompatible with "Semi-intelligent life". Less likely with life below
level V (25% chance, otherwise roll again).

Semi-intelligent life: The planet has a native life form which is not fully
sentient yet, but comes close, and may develop further. Requires at least
level III life; incompatible with "Intelligent life". Less likely with life
below level V (25% chance, otherwise roll again).

World forest: The entire land surface (except ice caps, probably) is
covered by a single huge forest. Requires a non-zero land area, and at
least level II life.


ARCHAEOLOGICAL FEATURES

Ancient artifacts: Artifacts left behind by aliens, thousands or millions
of years ago, exist on the planet. The aliens may or may not have been
natives.

5. COLONISATION
----

5.1. SECTOR CHARACTERISTICS

Two characteristics need to be determined for an entire sector. First,
decide how "civilised" the sector is -- that is, how much contact it has
had with interstellar society in general, and how much development has been
done. Second, choose the "opening date" for the sector -- the date at which
colonisation of the sector began.

Ideally, these should be decided before you start, rather than generated at
random. The following table is a suggestion for those who want one.

    D100    Sector description  Initial colonisation
    ----  ----  ----
    1-30    Unexplored          D6x50 years ago
    31-60   Frontier            2D6x50 years ago
    61-90   Typical             (2D6x50)+250 years ago
    91-100  Developed           (2D6x50)+500 years ago


5.2. PLANET QUALITY

Habitable (Earthlike or marginal) planets can be rated according to their
desirability for human colonisation. Of course, aliens may have different
criteria; if your universe includes many alien colonies, you may have to
modify these rules.

Planet quality (PQ) ranges from 1 to 99 for habitable planets (a planet
rated 0 would be uninhabitable, and 100 is excluded on the reasonable
assumption that nothing is perfect). Start with a base value of 50, and
modify as described below. If the final result is less than 1, record it as
1; if it\'s more than 99, record it as 99.

    [*1: Depending on what sort of interstellar society your universe has,
    you may decide that the presence of intelligent or semi-intelligent
    life would place a world off limits to colonisation.]

(For the statistically minded, to save you some calculations: Earthlike
planets average 74, with standard deviation 15; marginal planets average
24, s.d. 18.)


5.3. COLONIES

The basic chance that a planet will be colonised depends on the sector
civilisation level:

    Sector type  Colonisation chance
    ----  ----
    Unexplored   PQ / 2 percent
    Frontier     PQ percent
    Typical      PQ + 25 percent (max 99)
    Developed    PQ + 50 percent (max 99)

Roll the percentage or less on a D100. If the result is a success, find the
date of colonisation:

    Colonisation date = Sector opening date + (100 - PQ) x D100 / 10

If the planet failed the original colonisation roll, or the date is later
than the present date of your campaign, then the planet is uninhabited, and
you can stop here.

Find out how much contact the planet has had with interstellar civilisation
since its establishment. Again, the following is just a suggestion, and
should be adjusted to suit your universe\'s historical background. The same
contact level should probably be used for all inhabited planets in a
system.

    Sector type  Die roll
    ----  ----
    Unexplored   D6-3
    Frontier     D6-1
    Typical      D10
    Developed    D6+4

    Result  Contact level       Population modifier
    ----  ----  ----
    0       No contact          -6
    1-3     Occasional contact  -2
    4-7     Regular contact     0
    8-10    Extensive contact   +2

Now determine the current population and technology level of the colony.
The population level is given by:

    Colony age     Basic population roll
    ----  ----
    0-99 years     2D6 + (PQ / 20)
    100-299 years  3D6 + (PQ / 20)
    300-499 years  4D6 + (PQ / 20)
    500-999 years  5D6 + (PQ / 20)
    1000+ years    6D6 + (PQ / 20)

Adjust for the contact level, and use the following table to generate the
actual population and tech level. See section 6 for a more detailed
explanation of the technology levels.

    Result  Population         Tech level roll
                               No contact  Any contact

6. TECHNOLOGY
----

This is a brief description of the tech level scale I\'ve used. Some very
approximate equivalents are given for two well-known SFRPG tech level
scales, from SJG\'s _GURPS_ and GDW\'s _Traveller_.

Obviously any dates beyond the end of the twentieth century represent
little more than wild guesswork. Even if you use my technology scale, you
may want to change the dates and descriptions for the levels beyond
present-day technology. In particular, the point at which FTL travel is
developed will affect the history of your universe deeply.

Note that, in the interests of making this system usable with the vast
majority of SF universes, I haven\'t made any allowance for the possibility
that FTL travel really is impossible...

    And so he set to do it
    He tried to do what "couldn\'t be done"
    And he couldn\'t bloody do it.

7. INTELLIGENT LIFE
----

Obviously any system for designing intelligent aliens has to be based on at
least as much personal preference and just plain wild guesswork as hard
facts. Anyone who uses this system is urged to take a careful look at it
first and make any changes you think will bring it more in line with your
version of the universe.


7.1. PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION

This is intended to be a generic system for generating intelligent or
semi-intelligent species. Some minor modifications may be required to fit
some details of the aliens\' home world, if you\'ve already generated it;
most of these should be obvious enough that I don\'t need to spell them out
(for example, if the planet has no life more advanced than invertebrates,
you can exclude the vertebrates from the "metabolism and body structure"
roll).

Find the normal environment of the species:

    D100   Environment
    ----  ----

    81-82  Burrowing
    83-94  Amphibious

Find the type of metabolism and body structure:

    91-100  76-100        84-100        99-100        Hard-shelled

Use the first column for all flying creatures; otherwise, use the column
appropriate to the creature\'s body type. If there are two types of body
covering, re-roll the second if it comes out the same as the first.

Find the type of body symmetry and the number of limbs:

    D100                      Symmetry   Number of limbs
    Invertebrate  Vertebrate
    ----  ----  ----  ----
    1-20          1-60        Bilateral  4
    21-40         61-90       ...        6
    41-60         91-95       ...        8
    61-80         96-97       ...        (D6+4)x2
    81-85         98          ...        (D100+10)x2
    86-95         99          Radial     5
    96-100        100         ...        D10+2

(If you\'re wondering why most of the creatures with radial symmetry have
five limbs, it\'s not just Earth prejudice; there are good engineering
reasons why five is the optimum number of limbs for a creature with radial
symmetry. Having an even number of body segments is a bad idea, because it
weakens the body by placing several continuous seams around it. A creature
with three arms would probably be unable to survive if it lost one; five
are much better for redundancy. There are some echinoderms on Earth with
more than five limbs, but not many.)

For creatures with radial symmetry, all limbs are assumed to be dual
purpose arm/legs. Flying creatures with radial symmetry are assumed to be
lighter-than-air, balloon-like creatures.

For creatures with bilateral symmetry, roll once for each pair of limbs,
except as noted below:

    D100    Type of limbs
    ----  ----
    1-10    Wings if flying; fins if amphibious or aquatic; otherwise legs
    11-50   Fins if aquatic (not amphibious); otherwise legs
    51-70   Legs
    71-75   Dual-purpose arm/legs
    76-100  Arms

For flying creatures, assign one pair of limbs as wings without rolling
(wings generated on the table are additional pairs). All intelligent
creatures will have at least one pair of hands (either arms or arm/legs).
If you get a result that violates any of these checks, start again. If the
creature has more than ten limbs, roll only for the first five pairs; the
rest are all assumed to be legs.

Find the creature\'s diet:

    D100    Diet
    ----  ----
    1-10    Herbivorous
    20-70   Omnivorous
    80-100  Carnivorous

Find the creature\'s method of reproduction:

    D100   Type of reproduction
    ----  ----
    1-5    Asexual
    6-25   Hermaphroditic
    25-99  Two sexes

For flying creatures and snake-like creatures (any non-aquatic creatures
without legs), multiply the size by 4. The size generated is the creature\'s
greatest dimension -- height for humanoids, length for most horizontally
oriented creatures, wingspan for flying creatures. Round the size to the
nearest 10 centimetres (or 5 centimetres if it\'s less than one metre).


7.2. SPECIAL FEATURES

This section covers the sort of features that many role-playing games treat
as advantages and disadvantages -- natural weapons, unusually fast or slow
speed, non-human senses, and so forth. Some features relevant to your game
mechanics will have already been generated, such as the ability to fly or
swim, extra hands, or whatever degree of natural armour is implied by the
creature\'s body covering.

Attributes such as strength, dexterity, intelligence and so on are too
game-specific to be covered here. You\'ll have to wing it.

Roll D6-3 to determine how many special features the species has. Then roll
D100 on the following table the appropriate number of times; re-roll any
repeated results. Some of the entries are double (e.g. "acute vision/poor
vision"); the two are mutually exclusive, and there is a fifty-fifty chance
of one or the other. The "acute" or "poor" senses are relative to human
senses (which is why there\'s no "poor smell" feature -- the human sense of
smell is pretty poor to start with).

I haven\'t included precise definitions of the effects of each of these
special features; any details beyond what is implied by the names would
have to be worked out to fit your particular game mechanics.

    temperature is 35 degrees or higher, the natives automatically have

    generate as above.]

    [*2: Sonar implies acute hearing; add acute hearing to your list of
    features (don\'t count it towards the total), and ignore any other rolls
    of acute/poor hearing.]

Two other special features are determined separately: natural weapons and
speed.

The chance that the aliens will have natural weapons (claws, fangs, horns,
or whatever) is 20% for herbivores, 40% for omnivores, and 80% for
carnivores. This refers only to close-combat weapons; ranged weapons are
generated separately from the table above.

Roll 2D6 on the following table to find the aliens\' running (or swimming or
flying) speed, relative to human speed. Add 1 for carnivores. For land or
water creatures, subtract 2 if their average body mass is less than 10
kilograms. For flying creatures, don\'t adjust for mass, and double the
speed (the final multiplier, not the die roll).

7.3. PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE

The psychological profile of an intelligent species is described by a set
of six numbers: social, cooperation, aggression, exploration, technology,
and art. Each runs from 0 to 100.

Social: Indicates the degree of gregariousness and social organisation in
their civilisation. A social rating of zero would indicate a totally
solitary species with no social interaction at all; a social rating of 100
would indicate a hive-mind species with no concept of individual identity.
Some social contact is assumed to be required for the evolution of language
and intelligence, so a social rating less than 5 is not allowed in this
system.

Cooperation: Indicates how willing they are to cooperate with other
intelligent species. A cooperation rating of zero would indicate a totally
xenophobic species that refuses to even recognise the existence of any
other intelligent life; a cooperation rating of 100 would indicate a race
with no sense of species identity at all, making no distinction between
their own conspecifics and aliens.

Aggression: Indicates how warlike they are, both among themselves and
against other species. An aggression rating of zero would indicate a
completely pacifist species that never fought anyone for any reason; an
aggression rating of 100 would indicate a completely warlike species with
no interest in any other activity. For obvious reasons there will be a
negative correlation between the cooperation and aggression ratings (but
not completely -- for example, a species that enjoyed fighting and
frequently hired themselves out as mercenaries to anyone who needed
soldiers might have a high rating in both areas, while a peaceful but
isolationist species, such as Larry Niven\'s Puppeteers, would have a low
rating in both).

Exploration: Indicates their curiosity and interest in research and
exploring the universe. An exploration rating of zero would indicate a
species with no curiosity at all (since this seems incompatible with
intelligence, a rating of less than 5 is not allowed); an exploration
rating of 100 would indicate a species completely obsessed with exploration
or science.

Technology: Indicates their technological aptitude. A technology rating of
zero would indicate a species with no technology of any kind; a technology
rating of 100 would indicate a species obsessed with technology to the
exclusion of anything else. There is a strong positive correlation between
the exploration and technology ratings.

Art: Indicates what part artistic activities play in their society. An art
rating of zero would indicate a completely practical and utilitarian
species, with no aesthetic sense at all (to humans they would seem cold and
robotic); an art rating of 100 would indicate that aesthetic considerations
completely dominated practical ones (this would not be a survival trait,
which is why an art rating above 95 is not allowed). There is a negative
correlation between the technology and art ratings.

If the result is outside the allowed range, roll again.


7.4. TECHNOLOGY

To find a race\'s typical technology level, roll 2D10, add one-fifth of
their technological aptitude (from the psychological profile), and refer to
the following table:

    TL roll  Tech level

This size module would cost Cr3000. At this size and cost it probably wouldn\'t 
be feasible for furniture, although for background colour there is no real 
reason why at tl 14/15 very small contra grav might be possible.

Here is one of the problems with the FFS description of contragrav - it 
neutralises only 99% of the gravitational force acting on an object, so items 
still fall, albeit slowly, so additional fans would be needed to keep objects 
in place, which makes the whole arrangement rather complicated. For a starship 
common area it might be possible to just fine tune the artificial gravity to 
get objects to float. One major use for anti grav would be in negating some of 
the weight of ground based structures, simplifying construction and enabling 
projects like truly giant bridges.
The anti grav luggage appeared in the DGP Referee\'s Gaming Kit for 
Megatraveller. It neutralised the weight but not the mass of the objects in it, 
this meant that it was easy to carry 100kg, but if you tried to stop suddenly, 
the momentum would probably knock you over.

It depends how complex anti grav technology is, and whether it utilises 
components which might be used in other high tech systems.

This gives me some great ideas for _anti-grav grenades_ :-)

Hi - I\'m trying to find a database listing of the closest stars
to Sol - I got some info from NASA, but it doesn\'t have anything
nice like XYZ cooridnates, just angles and magnitudes, and I
don\'t have anything near the math to place these in 3d.  Does
anyone have something of this nature that is already in a

  {
    'body' => 'As the holiday doldrums slowly start to dissipate:

I\'ve caught up on last week\'s discussion of Space: Above and Beyond, and it 
seems to me there are some misconceptions out there.  I don\'t think SAAB suffers
so much from lack of a technical advisor as it does the need to present 
accessible entertainment not just for techies, but for a general audience.  

Now, I\'m not one to profess that we should "dumb down" all our TV shows for the 
lowest common denominator, but I _am_ a proponent of using "willing suspension 
of disbelief" where necessary to provide marketable entertainment.  (Yes, I 
believe there\'s a difference.)

Some of the problems with the show that have been discussed have been:

1)  Lack of accurate vector-based space-combat.

2)  A dodgy military hierarchy.

3)  Having expensively trained pilots double as ground troops.

4)  Dicey acting.

5)  The Americans-only "U.N." fighting force.

(My worst beef with the show is Wang\'s constant reference to 20th century sports
teams and players.  I get the feeling the Cubs might\'ve obtained a _few_ more 
players the caliber of Ryne Sandberg and Andre Dawson, no matter what the show 
thinks.  Couldn\'t they have thrown in a few made up names for players who played
during the 21st century?  Oh, and the disparaging remark about the 49ers did not
sit well with _this_ Bay-Area resident! <g>)


Addressing the above problems:

1)  I side with the members of the list that believe an accurate system would 
not produce exciting enough combat.  At least for the majority of the 
home-viewing crowd.  Remember, a large portion of the viewers are video-gamers 
and moviegoers who want some pyrotechnics.  Whether it\'s realistic or not, and 
to what degree, is irrelevant.  The point here is that the producers of the show
want to produce a winner, not a technical expose.  They want to sell advertising
dollars, not obtain the plaudits of the university science community.

2)  Yes, a bunch of lieutenants and one lt. col. leaves a few gaps to say the 
least.  But for one thing, we don\'t know what form the military of the future 
would take.  I doubt it would be quite like it is in SAAB, but I\'m willing to 
let it slide since it\'s not really germaine to telling the story anyway.

3)  Sure it\'s silly that pilots, whose training programs would cost millions 
(_billions_ due to inflation?), are used as ground troops, but here\'s a spot you
need to employ that "willing suspension of disbelief."  A TV show, especially a 
sci-fi TV show in which the effects cost a fair amount of money, cannot provide 
permanent employment to 50 actors.  Sure it\'d make more sense to have a squadron
of pilots and a platoon of troops, but a) It would dilute character development,
which the show is at least _attempting_ to provide, and b) it would be a 
budgetary nightmare for the show\'s producers.  I\'m willing to accept this little
lack of verisimilitude in order to appreciate the air/ground war story they\'re 
trying to tell, rather than disparaging it in deference for realistic military 
structure.

4)  Yeah, the acting\'s weak for the most part.  The show probably needs it\'s own
"Boxleitner" next year.  Sure, Bruce is no Anthony Hopkins, but you have to 
admit, he lends B5 an aire of legitimacy in a slowly crowding market.  You can\'t
help but like Sheridan, not just as a character, but as the respectable old 
hand.  Part of the establishment of that personality comes from the fact that 
Bruce Boxleitner brings market recognition to B5.  Hopefully, SAAB will get 
someone like that next season to fill the gap.

5)  See Mitch Schwartz\'s explanation in TML 522.  He says it better than I 
could.  His explanation works.  Now, if we don\'t _eventually_ start seeing more 
non-American troops filling positions, we have more reason to be skeptical.


I think we\'ve done the In Vitro issue to death, so I\'ll leave that one alone.  I
agree with Charles Collin\'s opinion, that it makes sense.

All in all, the show\'s about average, but I laud the effort and I don\'t think 
the show\'s producers are half-assing it or anything like that.  I think they\'re 
making good use of their resources and trying to put out not only a good 
product, but a marketable one.

I\'d like to know a few things about Striker II. 
1) What scale it has? A few single combatants like in WH40K or squads 
like in Squad Leader? Or something comletely different?
2) How well you can incorporate your PCs to combats?
3) How detailed it is? How much time it takes to play battles of about 
200 persons?
4) Is it any good?

The rich will be surrounded by them constantly, the poor will have access
only to the most basic and cheapest versions. Som common items at TL 13+ in
my campaigns include the following:

upper middle class and higher class homes will include a workout room, with
full g-control, up to the G-Comp limit by TL. (much like modern jaccuzzi\'s
and sauna\'s.)

A move to gravitic vehicles, at first as expensive luxuries, later as good
transport for urban high-rise zones. by TL 13+, you\'ll see private garages
all the way up high-rises. Law Enforcement and Emergency Services would be
early adopters, and have switched over by early TL 11.

gravitic "bullet trains" and chunnels.

Gravitic lift tubes reeplace elevators and escalators in common use, but
elevators and escalators would continue as back-ups. (TL 13+) Common term
for them (judging by my players useage) is "Shoots", spelled "Chutes". they
generally have rails that run up the sides.

Gravitic Desk toys by TL 11+. Middle class get them by TL13, children get
them by TL15.

Gravitic bonding laser printers by TL 13. Uses very intense, localized
gravitic effect to bond toner. Not really noticeable except for reduced
heat output and warm-up time.

Washers and dryers  use gravitics to augment function by tl12+ for
commercial machines, tl14+ for common machines.

Hospitals using repulsors for sterile area barrier by TL14+

Replace/Augment pneumatic container tubes with gravitics by TL 14+

ATC by TL 11 eclipses police in terms of numbers needed for common traffic duty.

DUI/DWI becomes more serious as gravitics become more common in vehicles.

Taller buildings on ground, as gravitics can relieve stress upon the frame.
Frames have built in limited reliability in case of power failures.
Gravitics in buildings become priority power users, normally tapping a
separate system of power mains, with auto switching to civil mains (with
pre-emption) in case of failures, as well as building back-up generators.

Gravitic pumps become common in urban and industrial fludis by late TL 11;
they allow fluids to "flow downhill" in any direction the piping may run,
and maintain good pressure with little noise and vibration.

With advent of Tractors (tl 14, by High Guard, as I recall) and repulsors
(TL 12, again HG), buildings are able to use trac/rep nets to stabilize
tops of high rises against winds by interlocking computer controlled webs.
Generally would be clearly maked with low power visible light lasers.

Wheelchairs supplanted by TL 12 for anyone with middle class income at all,
by TL 13+ for everyone.

Materials tech improves greatly with 4-G or better fields, and purity as
well with only 2-g compensation.

Fusion becomes practical: by combining gravitics, laser heating and room
temp superconductors, fusion that is portable becomes realistic.

by TL 14, most security areas will have a repulsor beam or gravitic trap to
"hold you at the gate" linked to a Metabolic Scanner. At TL 15, it becomes
a common option for the wealthy as a home security measure. Unauthorized
entry hits you with 5-8 G\'s (it exceeds the TL Limits for compensation, but
that is for long term devices; these are not intended for constant use, but
short (2-3 hour) use, after which everything gets checked..

The entertainment industry put gravitics to use early: within a few years
of first civilian available gravitics, they use them a lot. They\'ll have
the money.

Early gravitic designs would probably be gravitically augmented aircraft
and GEV\'s. By reducing required lift (even if only by 50%), that\'s much
more maneuverable, with shorter TO and Landing rolls. And combined Aerodyne
controls with tilt rotors, and add gravitic bouyancy, and you have
exceptionally good light tactical troop transports, urban assault vehicles,
and recon craft, as well as incredible v-tol and maneuver capabilities.

Most of my ideas are from the fleetway/quality "Judge Dredd" comics; while
they may be hokey, they have early TL-10 gravitics (primarily
gov\'t/military use) and they show a dark view of the social effects, but
the implementation is some of the best that I\'ve seen.

I\'m preparing to run a TNE based game in an alternate universe

The "hand" method will take far longer than I can afford.

So I wondering...is there any software available that will create
Traveller-isk star systems in the UWP format?  

I\'m looking for something that will generate new systems, not
massage the ones that have already been created.  I\'d like the
program to, hopefully, allow some sort of configuration of
the factors going into the system\'s creation, for example allow
you to lower/raise average tech levels.  I\'ve found some that
create systems in a graphical, but non-UWP format.  What I want
are text listings like from the old Scout book that I can print
out, edit, email to players, etc.  Graphics would be a bonus, but
would be frosting on the cake. <g>

It will have to run under OS/2.  Of course, that means it can be
a DOS or Windows 3.x program as well. <g>

I\'m taking it in an entirely different direction. <g> 

In my game universe gravity control comes at a *high* price!

Gravity control is accomplished with something I call an FGU
(Franklin Gravity Unit).  I make them small, cheap, low powered,
easy to build and available everywhere.  

There\'s just one little problem...they work by producing a field
that burns out microelectronic devices.  Everything electronic
has to be built with, at best, tube technology, and so is larger,
slower, more power hungry, etc.  Removing small powerful
computers changes the feel of the game a lot!  <g>

I had a exploration ship find a thriving civilization in one
scenerio that had advanced electronics, and (of course) hadn\'t
discovered the Franklin Effect.  Everywhere the players went they
blew all the circuits..made them most unpopular.
