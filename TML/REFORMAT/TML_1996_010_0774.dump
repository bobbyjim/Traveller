No, I\'m sorry; it is not or, at least, you do not recall correctly.  The 
applicable canon, even supported by FF&S, is that part (or even all) of a 
starship\'s jump fuel allocation can be stored in detachable, RIGID 
storage tanks.  Applying canon to the Gazelle close escort, the process 
goes like this:  The external tanks are drained by the jump drive 
reactor, which charges its capacitor banks; the tanks are detached; the 
capacitors are discharged into the hull net, opening the \'weave\' into the 
appropriate level of J-space, setting the ship\'s \'tumble,\' and forming 
the jump field bubble.  Nothing is stated in any canonical resource about 
the jump field bubble forming gradually as the external tanks were 
drained.  It is also important to note that fuel tanks used for the 
j-drive\'s fuel allocation, internal or external, must be rigid.  
Apparently, flexible fuel bladders cannot be drained quickly enough.

So, actually you\'re mostly correct, insofar as rigid, detachable fuel 
tanks as found on the Gazelle close escort, are concerned.

That may be true for water-going vessels, but the title of this thread 
includes the word "SPACE", as in outer space.  The point I made, that Mr. 
Broussard noted, was that many of the capital ships in Traveller could 
accelerate just as quickly as could fighters, negating their 
speed/maneuverability edge.  With the attention required to reaction mass 
(which limited just how much acceleration could be done), an edge for 
fighters over capital ships might be afforded in TNE/BL, but in earlier 
starship combat systems, there were many ships which, although being 
thousands of times larger than fighters, were just as nimble.  This 
problem will return along with thruster plates.

A possible fighter advantage, which many people, including Mr. Broussard, 
touched upon, was the lower sensor cross section owing to the fact that 
fighters were simply so much smaller.  Fighters in Traveller, to be truly 
effective, would have to rely on the fact that they\'re more difficult to 
detect than larger ships, perhaps being able to deliver a missile \'sucker 
punch\' before the opposing capital ships had time to react.

Now that they are gravitically-based, just dictate a speed limit
of about 0.01c (still high, but not TOO high). I use that number
because some HEPlaR craft (and things like Orion I) could get to

I don\'t really see even the Mongols comparing all that well.  A large 
number of the Mongols conquered China...then they saw that China had 
more things to offer than a short and dangerous life roaming the 
steppes...so they settled down...and their descendents became 
Chinese...

If the Mongols were like the K\'kree, they\'d have walked into China, 
exterminated the Chinese, then moved on elsewhere...

It would have been pretty pathetic if they had...  Even what

I think that all of the Traveller aliens have something in common

Actually a missile sub might have a harder time in some 
ways...considering the SAM\'s and close defense systems on your 
typical carrier group...

Never say never...  My understanding is that subs have gotten "shots" 
off against Carriers quite a few times in exercises...  

On the other hand, it would be tough.  In a pinch the carrier can 
travel at a speed of only a few knots less than your average torpedo, 
and it is heavily escorted by a variety of sub hunters:  S-3 Viking 
aircraft, helicopters, and of course all those wonder frigates and 
destroyers that are part of a carrier escort group...

A modern sub though, is a tough opponent for anybody...  

> Torps are too slow, and too short range to get a shot in on a carrier. 

Depends on the torp...  The British Swordfish reportedly has a speed 
of 70 knots... Most Russian & American torps would still have a 10-12 
knot advantage in speed...not enough for a long range shot...but good 
enough if you get close enough...

> DCB

Actually, in shallow waters, the submarine has the edge in ASW 
matters...lots of ground clutter to mess the heck out of active 
sonar, no room to drag a passive sonar "tail", etc...

You might want to think in terms of one spread...  Any sub getting 
close enough to a carrier is probably going to throw everything but 
the kitchen sink at it...if for no other reason than that 1 torpedo 
won\'t kill a carrier...

Labatt\'s Blue is one of the more popular beers up here.  Pamela

advertise the beer for Labatts.

I saw a movie last night called Canadian Bacon.  Hilarious movie.  With 
the end of the Cold War, the Yank\'s need a new enemy to keep their 
military factories going.  So they beging this massive campaign of 
anti-Canadian propaganda.

While this is true from canon - ie. once you have entered jump space
your destination and the time it takes to get there are fixed - damage
to the jump grid while in jumpspace should cause problems.  A big hole
blown in the hull can allow the jump bubble to intrude, placing part
of the ship off-limits.  Too big a hole, and the thing inrtrudes to a
catasrophic degree, so the vessel never arrives.  Obviously, the
catastrophic effect doesn\'t lead to a great adventure ("...there is a
big bang, which shakes the ship despite the inertial dampers. The jump
field monitors go haywire, redlighting across the holoHUD, and then
the entire vessel shudders under the compression of the encroaching
jumpspace as the jump field fails.  You die."), but the former can
result in some frantic moments.  See SOM for a description of a hull
breach in jumpspace.

I\'m surprised as well at this.  I\'d heard that it was Ronnie Hawkins (sp?)
who was the Canadian father of Rock \'n Roll.  The Band (Robbie Robertson
et al) was origianlly his band before going their separation.

 This is the therory that I support. I feel that while having super-nimble
fighters may be cool, it a: isn\'t very realistic and b: you don\'t get
big old battleships(Look at Rifts<shudder>, the large battleships are so
out gunned by less then a tenth of their price in fighters. That\'s what
would happen in Traveller most likley)

Actually, in the Eighties (I think) the John KHancock building (in Boston)
kept shedding windows in "high" winds (we\'re talking relatively normal
conditions, not hurricaines or storms).  They closed the entire square
underneath it and had to conduct a major redesign of the fittings for the
windows.  I\'d call this a \'suprise\'.

The same building is/was responsible for causing the landmark Trinity
Church next door (a 150 year old structure) to begin "sinking" because the
enormous pilings for the Hancock bldg had undermined the strata in the
area. 

Another building in Boston (Ruggles Center) had to be evacuated within a
year of the time it was built due to unexpected enviromental conditions as
the insulation installed became airborne.  Definitely a building
"failure".

Another possible advantage, non-canonical, which should/can be given to
fighters and certain other small craft is a higher G limit.  I know, you
say, 6G is the limit, but consider; Big vessels with large crews have the
need for their crew to walk around and work at full acceleration.  This
means the (canonical) limit of 6G is a restriction of the inertial
compensators, not the actual manuver drive (whatever that may be).  You
know as well as I do that fighter pilots in atmosphere have been known to
take as much as 9G for brief periods of time.   We also know that there
should be no barrier to increased acceleration with an increased manuver
drive size and power input.  I would therefore postulate that a Traveller
fighter craft could routinely accelerate at about 9G, this being 6G of
\'compensated\' acceleration and 3G of \'uncompensated\' acceleration. 

In fact, it is the fitness of the pilot, the sophistication of their \'G
suit\' and the reclined, seated position which would dictate the G limits
of the occupants.  The limits of the craft itself need to be set at
construction time, and reduced by any damage taken (this can be translated
from hits with a manuver drive result - sometimes it\'s the ship\'s
structure or inertial compensators which are limiting manuver
speed, not actual manuver drive damage). So unpassengered
ship\'s boats and grav vehicles should be similarly capable if built to a
higher G specification originally.

The problem now is that this makes fighters and small craft too important.
Fighters now make critical long-range sensor platforms ("The eyes and
ears" of a fleet or ship).  Plus, no small vessel will ever be able to
outrun a fighter equipped unit in a straight chase.

Something to think about, anyway.

     You can already do this using FF&S.  I seem to remember designing a 9G 
     fighter some time back. The limit is the TL (for G-compensation).  
     IIRC, crew in workstations can take 3G over the compensated level 
     without suffering ill effects.  Of course in FF&S the G rate wasn\'t as 
     important - the number of G-turns of fuel you could carry was.  But 
     now that we have thruster plates back, there should be >6G fighters 
     (at suitable TLs).

Whoa! Wait ONE DAMNED MINUTE!!! Surface area increases as 6*(r^2), whereas
volume is r^3... but thrust out (in Traveller, FF&S) is DIRECTLY
PROPORTIONAL TO SURFACE AREA; with some small scaling efficiencies. So,
thrust is limited to roughly 2*r^2 (due to facing problems) available for
thrust. (designed too many starships from decplans by component fitting).
So a Battleship runs into the problems of nowhere to mount it\'s 6G drive
AND it\'s weapons.

Remember: The highest ratio of Surface Area to Volume is the smaller object.

be able to move about to perform their duties in a fight.

 This is improved further by the ability to select only

Not really, the established 6g limit is for thruster plates.
You would need to use Rockets to exceed 6G\'s. (Yes, even for
0.1c rocks...) This was one of the things I liked when the MT
design rules came out. The limit also applies to gravitics,
hence the max 6G\'s compensation.

Especially with full masking. Plus Fighters are more likely to
be dedicated purpose ships (this one has lasers, that one delivers missiles,
the other one is a sensor platform, etc.), and more closely
designed to their purposes.

I don\'t see how, you are still limited by the # of qualified
pilots. Of course we don\'t have game mechanics in place for this one...

And?  See _Star_Wars_ again if this is a problem.
Of course that depends on "deflector" type shielding being commonly
available (maybe just better armor on rum-runners?).
Or maybe just Imperial engineers that should be, ahem, 
"downsized" for poor design decisions, and I understand that
that Imperium has one _heck_ of a retirement plan...

If you\'ve got Belters insystem with the folks on the Mars-like world,
then both groups benefit greatly!  Smallish planets would be very good
candidates for "walking-stick" type constructs radically increasing
the payloads you could get up into orbit.  If the Belters are already
up there, they are in a perfect position to \'bootstrap\' the
walking-sticks too.

Also consider that for the price of a moderately sized cap ship, one can
build a veritable smorgasbord of fighters.  It changes the who combat
scenerio to a war of attrition when you have a bazillion fighters to throw
at the enemy.

I still like the idea of letting the players go as fast as they want, then
"Now how much damage will that wing-nut do?"-ing them.   Interplanetary
flotsam will would be the most effective way of keeping speeds down (at
least for crewed ships).  I guarantee people would stop speeding now adays
if speed bumps got deadly when they exceeded the speed limit.

Galloping Gertie.  The bridge across the Tacoma Narrows (in beautiful
Washington state) literally tore itself to shreds when the wind picked up
and hit its mumblemumbleharmonic frequencymumble, or some such nonsense.
The bridge worked just fine until the wind blew through it at 35 knots.
Of course, they fixed the design when they re-built it and it works pretty
well now (i.e. if you can get through the traffic).

And while we\'re talking about falling bridges, the I-90 floating bridge
across Lake Washington sunk a couple of years ago (now you know why the
five miles of I-90 from I-5 across Mercer Island is the most expensive
strip of road in the US).  You\'d think that having 3 of the 5 floating
bridges in the world, the Washington DoT would put more brains into their
construction...

        Well, the principles may be well understood, but let\'s not forget
that implementation is critical to anything working properly.  And, in the
case of buildings and bridges, the existence of strict building codes backed
up with a good civil liability system help make sure that implementation works.

        Take Shenzen, a Special Economic Zone on the border between mainland
China and Hong Kong\'s New Territories.  No building codes, no rule of law
(although they\'re working on it).  Last month, this apartment complex just
went boom; gas leak blew it up.  Two days ago, there was this big hotel
fire, 29 guests died and lots more were hospitalized, and 9 firemen died.
Seems the builders didn\'t put sprinklers, emergency exits, emergency
lighting, fire escapes, and fire extinguishers into the place...  

        Point being that all these failures were quite predictable, but some
negligent greedhead builders cut corners, knowing full well that this could
happen, and people died.  Same would go for cold sleep capsules and the
like.  Relating this to Traveller, I\'d think that Law Level on the planet of
origin ought to have some sort of effect on the reliability of gear...

Just my Cr0.02 worth here... I look at fighters in space borne navys the
same way I do fighters in today\'s water borne navy.  The help a battle group
PROJECT power.

Besides the obvious advantages fighters have in terms of their being
difficult to detect, cheap and producable in large quantities, etc. etc.
etc. is the fact that a fighter can be "tailored" on the spot for all sorts
of missions and sorties.   Just look at the wide variety of missions that a
modern fighter can fill today.

Well... I won\'t get on my soapbox about what I think is wrong with the
concept of "multi role aircraft."  Fighters are supposed to be fighters and
bombers are supposed to be bombers, but never mind....

In a space borne situation I can see where a CAG would have his hands full
providing all sorts of mission mixes.  Let\'s see here... Screening patrols
to watch out for the other guy\'s fighters and maybe incoming mail... Recon
missions to find out where the other guys are...   ESM and ECM missions.
Alpha strike...  Strike CAP... AR missions... Close support for ground
troops (maybe)... 

And I wasn\'t stationed on a bird farm during my tour in the US Navy so I\'m
only guessing based on what I *do* know.

As far as using fighters to attack enemy capital ships... I say *yes* that
would definitely happen.  Look at WWII.  It was very risky for pilots in
those days to go up against capital ships that were bristeling with AA.  A
lot of pilots that flew alpha strikes in WWII got shot down, but enough of
them were successfull to have quite an effect every Navy in the fight.

In today\'s context you have SAMS to keep fighter/bomber pilots from
collecting pensions, but pilots know how to get around that.  In fact SAM
suppression is one of the mission profiles flown by some of the aircraft
sent out on a strike.  SAMS (or their equivelant) will no doubt get better
by the time we send ships into space, but so will the counter measures for
them get better.

Dogfights in space?  I don\'t really think so.   Exchanges of fire between
fighters will happen at ranges where the eyeball doesn\'t even see who your
shooting at.  I could be wrong as everybody who has predicted the end of the
dogfight era has been wrong and our airforces have had to relearn the
lessons of the previous generations of fighter pilots.

Anyway... I\'m going to let this one go...

I have an IBM clone and it has a Texas Instruments 486DLC chip in it.  I

processor that is rated at 38MHz is running at 7.4MHz (This is with Turbo

I thought I was having trouble with my battery as well.  CMOS would not be
there when I loaded the computer.  I got a battery, but when I changed out
the I/O card, the problem went away (or I haven\'t had my computer off for a
long enough time to notice).

My question is, can anyone tell me what I might have done to make the
computer operate so slow?  I\'ve tried disconnecting the extra (D:) disk
drive, and tried using my old I/O card, and nothing seems to speed it up.  I
played with the Jumpers tonight, and got it up to 8.5MHz, but I put them all
back to where they were when I got the computer.

Any help that wnyone can provide would be appreciated.  Sorry to waste the
Bandwidth.

Actually I beleive it was Bell, Banting some kind of a drug, penecilian

I went of Sir Frederic Banting Jr. High and we had an intense rivalry

Tacoma Narrows suspension bridge in Washington State was constructed with 
a fatal flaw.  When the wind speed exceeded about 30 mph the bridge began 
to sway.  Eventually the bridge disintegrated in about 45 mph of wind.  
There\'s film footage of this occuring.  Prior to failure the bridge deck 
is bucking up and down about 8 feet like waves in a pond.

Second Narrows Iron Workers Memorial Bridge, collapsed during 
construction because there was a flaw in its design, about 50 steel 
workers were killed when it disintigrated.  This bridge is in Vancouver 
Canada.

Save on Foods Parking lot, Burnaby Canada.  One of the roof support beams 
was designed to be rivited in the middle, when cars were parked on the 
roof top parking lot the roof caved in on opening day.

That shopping mall in Korea.  Simply collapsed due to substandard 
engineering and materials.  Hundereds of people were killed.

Happens all the time, well once every five or six years.  More often than 
not we never hear about it unless more than five people are killed in the 
collapse.  That\'s the way the media works.  I\'m sure everyone of us knows 
about some building in their home town that has a particularly nasty 
reputation of structural flaws.  

Hell our local emergency releif co-ordination center was supposedly built 
on bed-rock.  Now the building is settling and the elevator shafts are 
warping, the electrical conduit is buckling and they\'re having all kinds 
of problems.

I\'ve been reading all this stuff on the origin\'s of GDW\'s thought process 
etc. and I\'ve been wondering about some more practical stuff.

I know Dave Neilson is in periodic contact with Marc Miller about writing 
up a wrap up for TNE and I was wondering if you people had statistics on 
a number of Starships that are mentioned but never discribed in TNE.  
Particularly the RC Lancer, Fusilier, Manticora, Belladonna and Leviathan 
classes of ships.  I know that I and quiet a number of the other members 
of this list would be particularly interested in getting our hands on New 
Era statistics for these ships.

Is there much hope of Dave writing that wrap up so we can plot our own 
futures with the knowledge of what you had in mind?

That\'s exactly what I was contemplating -- the jumping ship is being
battered with surface hits (check those High Guard and MT hit tables), each
of which is taking off some lanthanum grid along with what other damage it\'s
causing.  Maybe the opponents are using a particle accelerator, or nuclear
missiles are detonating nearby.  Staying to check the jump grid means
certain annihilation; jumping means a chance at surviving a week of hellish
anxiety.  What are you going to choose?

Zuchai crystals appear in AZ: Crystals From Dinom, 8 JTAS 10 ("An emergency

I don\'t either, but I\'ve always played jump space per Larry Niven:  Looking
out a porthole during jump is like staring at your own blind spot --
uncomfortable and unnerving.  Covering the porthole won\'t help; it\'ll always
feel like the cover gets too small and some of the blind spot starts to peek
out.  The only approach is to close all portholes before jump with covers
that make them appear to be part of the walls.

If she is Zhodani, is she noble, intendant, or a prole with psionic power
who somehow slipped through the cracks?  What are her intelligence and
education statistics?

If Droyne, what caste, what position in the kroyloss, and how old?

If Imperial, in what era does the character exist?  What are her
intelligence, education, and social statistics?  What is her age?  How did
she get psionic training?

If Vargr, Aslan, or K\'kree, I have no idea anyway.  I think that the Hivers
don\'t have psionics.

The issues that I\'m trying to raise are (1) how prepared, psychologically
and emotionally, as well as technically, is she for the experience? and (2)
what might she have hidden from herself? If she isn\'t prepared, she runs the
risk of hurting herself, or at least changing herself in ways that she
didn\'t intend, by changing the "constellations of psychic energy" that
surround various aspects of her psyche (if I can badly paraphrase Freud).
If she has buried memories that are very powerful when uncovered, she could
find herself re-experiencing past traumas in the present.   

A Zhodani noble or a Droyne crone or leader would probably be very prepared
for the experience, and would probably have had experienced significant
psionic analysis in their lifetimes.  This would make the experience less
trying and closer to a routine; on the other hand, they probably wouldn\'t
have any motivation to do it.

An Imperial of ca. 1100 who took the one-year course at Joe\'s Psionic
Institute and School of Massage, on the other hand, might still be carrying
around a negative self-image because she is using psionics in the first
place.  Moreover, she might be carrying around unresolved psychological
issues from her own upbringing that she\'ll suddenly confront in the
auto-mindprobe.  

Those are a few ideas from me.

Or a St. Pauli Girl?  The leading maker of commercial Scout Brew uses Scout
Brew Sweeties to advertise the product.  The SBS are of various races and
sexes, but are chosen on the basis of ability to sell the product.  Humans
are generally in their early twenties, physically fit, with good skin and
figures.  I don\'t recall which other races drink Scout Brew.  It sounds like
a human thing, actually.

Classic example of this sort of thing occurred here in 
Phoenix...about 17 years ago.  We had a series of 500 year floods 
down here.  During the last of them, 1 of the larger freeway bridges 
(The Maricopa Freeway bridge, I-10 for those of you familiar with the 
area) began to buckle and sag.  It was designed to take about 250,000 
cfm water release from the dam upstream...1 of the 2 bridges began to 
buckle and sag at 150,000 cfm.  This was a modern bridge (less than 
20 years old)... enjoying the latest in modern engineering...and 
materials...

Meanwhile, about 5-10 miles upstream, the Mill Avenue bridge, which 
was like close to 100 years old...withstood everything that was 
thrown at it...

People will skimp, people will cut corners, and frankly people 
(including *GASP* engineers, designers and architects) will screw up. 
 This is true now and it will always be true...as long as people are 
in the mix, anyways...

Heck, the wheel and fire aren\'t reliable 100% of the time, and we\'ve been 
using them for about 5000+ years now...what makes you think that 
fusion plants, j-drives, and computers will be...

        Blue a decent beer?  As far as Canadian beer goes, Blue is not one
of my favorites.  My faves are Maudite (quite literally "accursed") and
Illegale.  Maudite is this really cool refermented-on-lees beer with 8%
alcohol content, this cool red colour, and labels that would make Oral
Roberts\' head explode.  The same brewery also makes one called "La Fin du
Monde", or "the End of the World" with 9% alc. 


Illegale is brewed up in the Saguenay-Lac-St.-Jean region of Quebec, made
with some incredibly pure springwater, and is really, really good for a more
conventional beer.

        I wonder how you could work a micro-brewery into a Traveller campaign.

During the Hard Times Era the grand admirals of the major factions realized; that if the rebellion were to continue, the known 
galaxy would collaspe. A massive coup was planned for the year 1128. That would return intersteller government to the respestive 
navies. The only two hold outs were Solomani Security and Lucan. The Solomani revolt lasted 2 years. Resulting in the eradication of 
the hated SolSec. Lucan was forced into exile. Some speculate that he released the virus as a doomsday weapon.

Unknown to the factions, a new faction had been developing, The Virus. 

The period between 1130-1200 is known as the consolidation wars. "Two" powers emerged, the Virus and the Imperium. Although the 
largest independent state either has is only 100 worlds. The perception is that the other is a harmonious enity that spans the 
galaxy. And should treated with the upmost supension.

Oh, I always choose the option that seems to have the greatest chance of 
my skin surviving intact.   While hellish anxiety isn\'t exactly a trip 
to VacationLand, it\'s a good deal better than certain annihilation. :)

Hmmm....has anyone ever built a Traveller ship with a double-hull like 
present-day tankers (are supposed to) use?  Would it work?  

Could you have one jump grid on the interior hull, and another on the 
exterior hull, then activate the interior one if the exterior grid is 
damaged?  Would that allow you to sort of jump out of your exterior hull, 
leaving it behind?

	Yeah, I tried this too.  They only really work in ground effect 
and even then just barely.  Other people who know better than me have 
said that the FF&S numbers are way too low. The people who wrote FF&S 
were guesstimating anyway, particularly for high-tech stuff, so you could 
probably double those thrust values and still be in the ballpark.

campaign that never went anywhere so drop me a line about it if you like.

 I\'d thought of the game-element theme, but nothing I came up
 with seemed to fit.  Moreover, I didn\'t want to present an
 impression of a focus on a particular aspect of Traveller.
 Thus, the names I _did_ come up with.  "Freelance Traveller" is
 my best so far, but I think _we_ can do better.

 Good!  And either of these could also be for campaign writeups/

 Which is where I got "FT" from.  "Freelance" suggests, in my
 mind, the mustered-out adventuring mode, as well as the
 non-canon/non-official/non-IG publication of the Ezine;
 "Traveller" comes _directly_ from the name of the game, as well
 as designating the broadest rle of the Player Character.

T::>Ummm...I don\'t know.  I\'d prefer something more to do with Traveller.  Ie.

T::>X-Boat Online

 The problem I have with this is that MPGN hosts a certain
 mailing list...

 ::>The Traveller Gazette\\Star\\Times\\Tribune, etc.

 This set of names I wanted to avoid entirely, because I felt
 that they came too close to sounding like an official
 publication from the publisher of Traveller.  Unless IG
 explicitly gives this publication some sort of imprimatur, I
 don\'t want to set myself up to even look like I might be
 stepping on their toes.

T::>Editorial -- "Captain\'s Log"

 Great!

 ::>In-Game News Reports -- "Across the Imperium"

 Two minor problems with this: (1) It suggests a "canon" Ezine
 universe; something I\'m not sure I want to do; (2) If instead
 this column follows the TNS, it suggests permission from IG to
 do this, as well as suggesting that the IG universe is the
 target of primary support - neither of which will be
 necessarily true.

 Those issues don\'t necessarily rule this out though; thanks for
 the suggestions.

Dave spells his last name "Nilsen" BTW. He\'s too polite to mention

Can\'t help ya, Sundance. Marc has all of the computer files relating
to TNE, including any of the ships that were worked up (Frank did the
Manticore for Battle Rider, and was supposed to convert it over to BL/FF&S
format, but I don\'t know if he ever managed to get to it. Marc picked up the
files shortly after we closed down, when the copyrights/trademarks reverted
to him. They are his now, and 
I don\'t have copies of anything I wasn\'t working on.

That depends on what Ken Whitman and Marc decide. They\'ve been a 
_little_ busy lately, so I don\'t blame them for not coming to a 
decision yet.

Can\'t do that without violating Marc\'s copyrights. Check with him,
he might be willing to send the material to you. Have you checked 
the local stores for copies of the books in question. We shipped
quite a few to the hobby distribution network, and they should be 
available through normal channels. See if the shop can\'t special 
order them for you. Chessex and Berkeley, among others, should have supplies.

Well, having graduated from Engineering school last year, I seem to recall
getting this ring... ah yes, there it is (on my finger). Canadian
engineering school graduates go through this (odd, pagan) ritual and
are all given an iron (stainless steel these days) ring, as a symbol
of our responsibility to the saftey of society at large. Rumor has it
the first rings were made from steel from a collapsed bridge in Quebec
as a reminder of the people who died... Presumably the great emphasis
engineering schools place on responsibility and getting things right
by testing your assumptions leads one to believe that screwing up
happens and that if you don\'t try to avoid it, it\'ll probably happen.
(Note: I graduated in Computer Engineering, which, although not perhaps
as obviously dangerous as Civil Engineering, is still fraught with problems.)

Someone writes about the floating bridge in WA state:

Yeah, the joke is that the last snowplow in Seattle sunk on the bridge.
That\'s why Seattle drivers\' brains all turn off when it snows. Those
guys crack me up!

Urgh. Blue. Has the same reputation Fosters has in Oz. Popular, but

Hm. I think \'The Traveller Adventure\' had a winery... maybe you could

OK - enough off-topic drivel. On to my Traveller related question:

The Suerrat (sp?) and the Geonee (sp?) are described where? I just
got my hot little hands on V&V and S&A and both races get passing mention.
They\'re minor human races but get no real description. They must be
profiles in the JTAS or Challenge. Where/when/will someone send me
a copy of the article(s)???

Anyways, I had to get all that off-topic stuff off my chest all at once.
Blue, yuck. *shudder*

I would think that if \'fighter\' type craft were desired, it would be easy
enough to skew the thruster plate design rules.  What I would do is make the
large thruster drives less efficient than smaller thruster drives.   If you
like fighters, but dislike missiles using thruster drives to accieve extreme
high speeds, invoke a minimum size rule.   Or, if you dislike fighters, go
the oppisite way and make small thruster drives less efficient than large
ones.   Hey... we can do this... it is a science FICTION game where we can
change the rules.

However, one does like to stay close to main stream \'canon\'.  Change too
many rules from the published version of the game and everyone will see you
as lunitic fringe and not talk to you.

        But in a \'fleet\' action, no one will worry about the fighters.
They cannot pack enough punch to get thru the capital ship\'s 10 to 15+
meters of armor.   They cannot mount a big enough meson weapon to get thru
any reasonable screen.   The rules do not allow ramming.
        Wait-a-minite....   Wait-a-minite....  Evil thought has just crossed
my mind....    A \'fighter\' with 200 or so small laser\'s (1 to 3 points
damage range). <TNE / FF&S Designs>   A squadron of these open fire on a
capital ship and it\'s sensors might dissappear under the barrage of \'minor
damage\' surface hits.   If the silly naval designer failed to include
multiple sensor package back-up\'s this would work.   If a ship is defended
by sandcasters, have 2 or 3 squadrons gang up on it, it can only fire so
many canisters per turn.
        Of course, any capital ship with less than 10+ sensor back-up\'s
deserves to get its \'lights\' punched out, so to speak.

Well the way I do it, you could (in fact would) activate the grids to
protect the ship, but the grid isn\'t what you *use* to jump...that\'s
the jump coil.  I know other people do it differently, but in my
games:  the Coil opens the rift into which the pilot steers the ship
where the astrogator locks onto a distant gravity source and closes
the rift behind the ship; the Grid maintains a bubble of normal space
around the ship protecting it from the jump space environment.

That\'s why you\'ve got one *hell* of a shock absorber system between the
pusher plate and the rest of the ship. It smooths out the blast into a
"surge". The actual acceleration depends on how many bombs per time
unit you use.

However, the reliability will go back *up* (at least partially) at the

You forgot the Aztecs and Maya (two related, but *very* different

Then there are various African cultures, like the folks who built
Zimbabwe (the city, not the country). Ditto for all the near and far

And the M\'ri (Faded Sun trilogy), and the various aliens in some of the

humans. Human physically, but *very* alien mentally.

Gordon Dickson had some decent aliens in some of his books. And for

Personally, I\'d like to see the look on someone\'s face when you launch
a flight of fighters with Mesklinite pilots (they consider 200-300 gees
to be "normal", and don\'t mind 700-1000). Who needs thrust
compensators? :-)

The Ancients are almost certainly patterned after the "Forerunners" in
many of Andre Norton\'s books. Though I like her setup better. The
Forerunners is just a generic name for *all* the civilizations that
wandered the galaxy and becamer extinct long before even the most

Actually, the law gets *really* weird here. For example, I can get a
copy of any piece of software written for the government for
(essentially) free, unless it is classified. You see, the government is
not allowed to own copyrights on anything. 

So, unless they claim classification (they probably do), I can buy a
copy of the R&D data from the US Government Printing Office! And then I
can just take them to somebody else to build them.

I suspect the situation is more along the lines of the government
having an exclusive contract for the production of the engines.

It\'s possible to take that kind of gee load for quite some time if you
are flat on your back. The problem in aircraft is that the acceleration
you are undergoing is mostly in the "head to foot" direction, though a
few manuevers induce acceleration in the opposite direction.

If you are in good shape and taking acceleration in a "front to back"
direction, you should be able to handle 3 gees for a *long* time, and
many could probably handle 5 gees equally indefinitely.

Fighters in Traveller *will* have you taking acceleration in this
preferred "flat on your back" position. You won\'t have as much of the
violent turns, though "jinking" to dodge a missile could result in
significant gee loads in odd directions. But for any sort of
*manevering*, you\'ll be using the main engine, which points thru your
back. 

> I would therefore postulate that a Traveller

I\'d expect to see 12 gees as not uncommon. You\'d select pilots for G
tolerance, and 6 gee flat on your back is *not* unreasonable for
drastic manuevers etc.

But fighters are going to *eat* fuel like it was going out of style. So
if you have enough firepower to keep the fighter dodging, you may have
a chance. Plus, he\'s got to close the initial distance as well as any
initial velocity difference.

unless he starts *coasting* at some point, he\'ll be going too fast to

I have a friend who lived down here in Arizona who moved up to 
Seattle about 5-6 years ago.  A few years ago (\'91 or \'92) they got 
hit by a series of big snow storms, tied the city up in knots for a 
couple of weeks...  He said that the biggest problem with it was that 
you could park all of Seattle\'s/King County\'s snow clearing 
equipment in his garage....

You guessed it, he doesn\'t have a garage...

That would seem to be reasonable enough...actually, the winery

The Geonee are profiled in Traveller Digest #11...
The Suerrat are referenced to briefly in Alien Module #8, Darrians 
basically comparing them to the Darrians...

There have definitely been references to them elsewhere...the 2 DGP 
Alien Books, and others...but I don\'t know that anybody detailed them 
all that much...

Maybe somebody else can correct me?

1.	OF SUBS AND CARRIERS

David C.. Broussard said:
>I doubt in modern naval warfare that a sub would get a torp shot at a

missile style sub could take out a carrier. 

Hate to tell you, David, that in one of the *Kangaroo* wargames an Aussie 
Orion (non-nuclear) sub waited on the bottom, floated to periscope depth  
in the middle of a US task force, and "sunk" the Enterprise. And, AFAIK, 
they got out as well.

2.	PSIONIC AUTO MINDPROBE

This doesn\'t make sense to me, *unless* the PC is trying to find out what 
happened to them while they were unconcious (asleep, drugged, or 
otherwise KO\'ed). You *may* allow them to attempt to retrieve memories of 
the event (mostly sounds). Otherwise, why bother?

3.	SPACE FIGHTERS

AFAIK, one big problem with numerous ships (for example, a flotilla of 
fighters), is more ITO having enough pilots to fly them. The original 
_Trillion Credit Squadron_ parameters always specified the number of 
pilots you could have available.

4.	BULDING FAILURES

The undercroft car-park at work (in Canberra) is designed with clearance
for NSW ambulances.  ...Only thing is, ambulances in the ACT are taller,
and don\'t fit under the door. 

5.	MINOR RACES FOR ETHAN

The Geonee are detailed in _Challenge ??_. The Suerrat - I haven\'t found 
a reference yet.

   Howdy, I saw you requests for info on the TML.  I have Challenge #71 and
Striker II and could send you the info as .GIFs.  Of course as Loren
mentioned you would need to have proper permission to use that infomation on
the web.  Also, I was thinking about the pocket empire symbol of yours, you
do realize  that the castle is the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers insignia and
would be familiar to many Traveller players especially the American ones.
You of course can say that the insignia was choosen because your pocket
empire wanted a symbol that represents the rebuiding of civilization and the
USACoE emblem represening construction and building seemed to fit the bill.
There are of coarse those wiennies out there who will whine that there is no
way a comtemporary emblem will be used 3+ millinium in the future.  To
answer those whiners just tell them how when Terra went to the stars so did
the USACoE, who were by then called the Engineers Corps and how in some form
or other the Corps continued to operating and in fact still does.  Well let
me know if you still want me to do a picture of your pocket empires symbol
or not.  Oh, yea I think I\'ll try to do a bit more on the Know Space map,
kinda put it on the back burner and then forgot about it.  I think I\'ll do
the background and sector boarder and let you add the text, OK?
    On the movie front, rented Jonny Neumonic.  The movie has all sorts of
really cool cyberpunk stuff, wet ware, virtual reality computer interfaces,
Cyberized bodygaurds and so on, but the move was lacking in any emotiom that
Keanu Reeves could have been whacked half way through the film and I
wouldn\'t have cared.  Speaking of Keanu, is he really Canadian, I mean the

Mutitions Act. The US gov classifies *everything*, as a general
precaution, and then doesn\'t protect *anything*.  <g> Heck, if PGP is
covered under the Mutitions Act, and it is, then you know that
virtually every piece of software ever produced is also protected.
BTW, even though the Justice Dept has dropped the case against Phil
Zimmerman they still claim PGP is a resistricted technology.

It\'s more than that.  

Take the space shuttle and it\'s compenent parts as an example.  The
government has had offers to buy the existing shuttle fleet, and
offers to purchase new shuttles from other governments and from
private sources. They turned them down flat.

Eris

ps.  I ran across a piece of software yesterday while I was cleaning
out some old boxes, I can\'t remember what it was, but it surprised me
with "Illegal to transport or sell outside the US."  Heck it was an
inexpensive accounting program or something...maybe an old copy of
Lotus 123.

        Dude, I can relate.  I normally use my middle name, "Darroch", which
is pronounced much as it\'s spelled save for the last "ch" which is this
wierd Gaelic hard-ch deathrattle noise.  I\'ve run into maybe three people
outside my family who can pronounce it, and as for spelling, well, lets just
say we could start a support group.

This is the one I\'m having the most trouble with - coming up with a good 
name for the e-zine as a whole.  Don\'t know how much help I\'ll be on this 
one, but I\'ll continue to give it thought.

I\'d like to see news of goings-on in other referee\'s games included. Not 
just novelizations (which would preclude those of us who aren\'t good 
narrative writers from participating) but even something as simple as 
notes from the campaign.  Just to get a feel for what is going on.  For 
one thing, it would be nice to be able to use that information in my own 
campaign - as rumors, TAS News, and/or influences on the actions of PC\'s 
and NPC\'s.

Yeah, it does sound that way. :(   But, since it is the section I am most 
likely to submit material for, I figured I was obligated to at least 
throw out a name for the section. :)

Since The Traveller Book actually lists the names for the different types 
of adventures (Patron, Casual Encounter, Amber Zone, Adventure, 
Campaign), do you think it would be permissable to use the first three as 
column titles in the e-zine?  That would certainly be the clearest approach.

Side Note:  I like that about Traveller: there are not only an 
almost infinite variety of adventure possibilities, there is also a good 
variety of officially recognized adventure lengths.  The above-mentioned 
ones, plus Folio Adventures, the Double Adventures...  The length of 
an adventure can be anything from a couple of hours to thousands of 
hours of real time.  Until I came upon Traveller, I had mistakenly 
thought that all RPG adventures had to be as lengthy as one of the TSR 
modules!


Anyway, I\'ll continue thinking about possible magazine/column names...

     ?Huh? It\'s true. A fighter in space can be launched with the same 
     initial speed as the carrier, PLUS whatever velocity the launch tubes 
     give (don\'t tell me that launch tubes are just long gunbarrels that 
     the fighter flies down, a la some crummy space opera - those buggers 
     are magnetic railguns that shoot fighters into the sky). 
     
     So a 6G carrier accelerating towards its target launches a squadron of 
     fighters, giving maybe a 20-30G boost over the length of the launch 
     tubes (catch your lunch, flyboy). This would have your fighter leaving 
     the carrier at maybe 500m/s faster than the carrier itself (somebody 
     check my calculations, please!). The carrier can then peel off and 
     withdraw to a safe distance, leaving the relatively \'disposable\' 
     fighters to hit the enemy capital ships. 
     
     This initial speed plus the 6G acceleration of the fighter, plus 
     (possibly) some kind of disposable high-acceleration strap-on booster, 
     would have your fighters intercepting the target faster than the 
     capital ship could. Of course, they would probably only have the 
     opportunity for one salvo of missiles before momentum carried them WAY 
     past their target. 
     
     Fighter dogfights would be very rare, since you\'d need to match 
     velocities fairly closely. Only place such things might happen is 
     where both vehicles\' velocities are tied to some external factor (ie 
     in orbit or in a dust cloud or some such). 
     
     Note that I think 6G acceleration is pretty bloody poor for thousands 
     of years of technological development. I would expect a TL 15 fighter 
     to have ten times the acceleration of a TL 12 craft, and a hundred 
     times that of a TL9 one. Say TL 9 = 2G, TL12 = 20G, TL15 = 200G.

Heh.  

My mother and I are confirmed members of the Church of 49er Faithful.
Die-hard fans of San Francisco\'s pro (American) football team.  If you were

I\'m no better.  When I was in hospital last year, I went nuts as I realised
that the first game of the season was on in few hours..  My wife ran home to
get my niners hat and t-shirt (I couldn\'t wear it, too many tubes in me, we
draped it over my chest.)

Traveller tie-in?  uhhhhh......  I\'m working on Rollerball rules for

If Congress will clear arms sales to foreign powers, then surely it
would allow the sale of a jet engine (which just happens to be a
crucial component of a weapon) to domestic commercial interests for
commercial purposes.  Of course, this doesn\'t mean that the Imperium
allows just anyone to purchase J-6 drives, but there are plenty of
extra-Imperial TL 15 worlds to but from.  The question then is does
the Imperium ban the use of J-6 drives.  In TNS news items prior to
the 5FW, Tukera Lines were apparently starting a J-6 service from,
Regina to Capital.

Can\'t have many books in it then; a library worth of books is *heavy*
- - if the architect forgot them, the building would fall down.  As LKW
said, definitely an urban myth.  Reminds me of a story about the
college where I did my first degree - "UMIST main building was
designed with a swimming pool on the top floor. but the architect
forgot to include the weight of the water, so now it is just a gym" -
a friend of mine at Imperial College told me the same story about his

        I compared the FFS thrust-to-power values with some real-world
        ducted fan designs, and it appears that FFS ducted fans are
        inferior than those we have today.

        Unfortunately I could find only limited amount of data about
        modern ducted fan development, and most currently available data
        is from the US X-planes -projects. The available research papers
        described a 182 cm fan with gas-turbine rim-drive. This fan was
        used in a hybrid VTOL fighter (I think it was Republic AP-110 or
        something), where a turbojet engine was used as gas generator to
        rotate the ducted fan on lower speeds. On higher speeds the ducted
        fan was covered with shutter, and the thrust was provided by the
        turbojet engine.

        The turbojet engine alone could produce 2000 kg thrust, but when
        all of the engine exhaust was used to rotate the ducted fan, the
        fan produced 7000 kg thrust.

        Ducted fans can be used on subsonic and possibly transonic
        aircraft, since their velocity range is slightly higher than
        with propellers, but they can not be used on supersonic flight.

        With little number crunching and real-life technical knowledge
        it could be possible to design a TL-8+ FFS airfighter with
        fission reactor (only heat-generating reactor and boiler, no
        electric turbines), steam-driven ducted fans for takeoff and
        acceleration, and fission-heated nuclear ramjets for high-speed
        flight.

        At higher TL the same airfighter could be designed with fusion
        reactor, electric ducted fans and electric ramjet. Maybe.

Given that 6G\'s is the limit of inertial compensators, I challenge you to
find me a pilot that can withstand the extra 194 G  at TL 15.  Do you
realize just how *fast* an accelleration that is? Anything organic (and
inorganic for that matter) would be promptly crushed.

About a week ago, John Snead mentioned the works of George R.R. Martin, Elucki 
Bes Shahar, and Joan Vinge as being excellent alternate literary sources for 
Traveller. Bill White mentioned Jack McDevitt\'s _A Talent for War_ as being an 
excellent source as well.  [I can\'t comment on the first three, as I have not 
read the books in question, but _A Talent for War_ would make an excellent 
Traveller adventure.]

I would like to add the _Exordium_ series by Dave Trowbridge and Sherwood 
Smith.  These are some of the most Traveller-like books I have read. 

The author\'s webpage (http://www.well.com/user/davetrow/) contain the 
following back-cover blurbs:

The Phoenix in Flight 
(ISBN 0-812-52024-6)   
Humans have colonized a thousand worlds, and empires have risen and fallen. 
Now the Phoenix House rules the Thousand Suns from their planet Arthelion. And 
now the Panarch Gelasaar has won the mortal enmity of Eusabian, Lord of 
Vengeance, Avatar of Dol, the ruler of Dol\'jhar. 

In one swift instant that has taken more than twenty years to plan, Eusabian 
will strike, slaying Gelasaar\'s sons and taking the Panarch himself captive. 
And then Eusabian will sit on the Emerald Throne, and Dol\'har will rule the 
Panarchy of the Thousand Suns. 

But Brandon nyr-Arkad, the Panarch\'s scapegrace son, has chosen this moment to 
defy protocol and evade a ceremonial duty. And so he escapes the death 
prepared for him, and lives. Now the hope of the Thousand Suns rests in the 
sensual, surprisingly capable hands of an aristocratic fugitive with an agenda 
all his own. 


Ruler of Naught 
(ISBN 0-812-52025-4)  
Jerrode Eusabian, Avatar of Dol, sits uneasy on the Emerald Throne of the 
Thousand Suns, while Brandon vlith-Arkad, rightful heir to the throne, is 
harried across space. 

Brandon was meant to die, along with his two older brothers. But he escaped by 
merest chance--now he is the only hope for the restoration of the Phoenix 
House and the salvation of the people they once ruled. Brandon and his allies, 
the crew of the Rifter ship _Telvarna_, must flee from peril to peril in 
search of the one haven no Rifter would ever willingly seek: Ares Station, 
heart of the Panarchy\'s military power. 

And across the unthinkable reaches of space, the scattered Fleet of the 
Thousand Suns is slowly learning that their Panarch has been taken, and their 
home worlds sacked. 


A Prison Unsought 
(ISBN 0-812-52026-2)  
Brandon vlith-Arkad is safe on Ares, the Panarchic Navy\'s HQ. The sole heir to 
the Emerald Throne must now fight a battle of symbols and deadly political 
intent, if he is to win the power to order the Navy into battle, to rescue his 
father, and win back the Panarchy now usurped by Eusabian of Dol\'jhar. 

With him in this prison of velvet ropes and poisoned gifts is the crew of the 
_Telvarna_, the Rifter pirates whose loyalty Brandon has won in battle. 

Meanwhile, Brandon\'s father, the Panarch of the Thousand Suns, is being 
transported to the prison planet Gehenna. On board the ship he is fighting his 
own subtle war with his former fosterling, Eusabian\'s son, Anaris. If Gelasaar 
can discover any hint that Anaris can rule as an Arkad would, the captive 
Panarch will aid Anaris to overthrow Eusabian himself. 


The Rifter\'s Covenant 
(ISBN 0-812-52027-0)  
>From Pirate to Emperor... 

Young Brandon Arkad has been brought by war and disaster to a duty he never 
expected: Panarch of the Thousand Suns, Emperor of the human worlds beyond the 
Rift. But his Empire is in shambles, as the implacable Jerrode Eusabian and 
his Rifter allies continue to pillage whole planets, and the Emerald Throne 
is out of reach on occupied Arthelion. 

The surviving nobility of the Panarchy have gathered aboard  Ares , the 
headquarters of the Panarchic Fleet. Now Brandon must grasp the power given 
him in the moment of his father\'s death, and wield it to wrest his 
empire from the hands of the usurper. But he must win the faith of his people 
before he can hope to win a war, and that will not be easy. 

For there is a traitor at the heart of the Panarchy, thwarting Brandon\'s every 
move with poisonous rumor and murderous plots--a traitor at the center of 
Brandon\'s councils, close enough to be invisible--a traitor who will stop at 
nothing to destroy the Arkad dynasty. 


The Thrones of Kronos 
(December 1996)  


Trowbridge says that he would "like to think of it as a sort of weird hybrid 
of the _Lensman_ series and _Dangerous Liaisons_."

Sorry of this sounds like a commercial, but it is one of the best series I 
have ever read, so when I get the chance to advertise it I jump.

The first *long range* transmision was made in Canada. And it was
Marconi who did it. He\'d done a fair amount of short range stuff
elsewhere.

BTW, at the time it *wasn\'t* Canada, it was Newfoundland. :-)

1. TNE WRAP-UP

If it is any consolation for Dave, I thought that his remark was just an 
off-hand comment and certainly not an attack on IG. I hope that no-one 
there took it as such.

I also want to extend my best wishes to him in his efforts to wrap up 
the Regency/Coalition storyline - especially the future of the Regency as 
he sees it.

2. SALES FIGURES


Something I should point out as I remember it: my question to Don was 
"why did you *initially* select Bk2 and HG as the starship rules?". This 
is when he gave me the figures. Now, from what I\'ve been able to guess, IG 
felt that this was probably the most controversial area of the game. They 
ran the idea of Bk2/HG "up the flagpole" to see who would shoot at it.

This approach has allowed all of us to have an input into the form that the 
"new" rules are taking - either directly, such as Dave Golden & Wildstar\'s
work, or via the responses to Marc\'s survey (Don has a copy), or just via our 
comments/criticisms/supportive words.

Actually the Regency uses them also.  If you read the Referee\'s Section
on Avery, it talks about using domesticated specialy bred virus
strains. Also the Department in charge of fighting the Virus keeps some
strains of Virus on hand.  
I think that the upper levels of the government keep Virus strains,
knowing how useful it could be, while telling the people that Virus is
evil and must be destroyed.    The Regency puts on this great act of
having changed from the old bad days of the Imperium, but still does
alot of the same stuff.  In the RSB, there is a paragraph on how useful
lies are, ie Norris promoting himself etc.

     compensation...
     
     Does anyone have any accurate data on the number of G\'s a pilot (i.e.

     etc. can maintain for a couple of hours at a time without penalty (and 
     also the max g\'s that a pilot can still just keep conscious)?
     Personal, anecdotal experience says that I (unfit & untrained) was 
     able to maintain between 2-3 G\'s (IIRC) in a glider (very reclined 
     seat - almost horizontal) whilst circling in thermals for about 45 
     minutes before I got dizzy.  I guess military pilots would be able to

Lots!  This is a wonderful campaign opportunity!  <evil grin>

While I\'ve heard a few people saying that this can\'t be done, or that you
shouldn\'t allow it, IMHO that\'s a bad attitude for a referee to take.  If at
all possible, the referee should encourage the players to do all sorts of
things - even things that you didn\'t think of.  It\'s the mark of a poor
referee to rule them impossible just because it requires thought or
preparation that he hasn\'t done (on the other hand, it\'s perfectly within
the referee\'s rights to end the session early so that he can catch up with
the players).

YOu can do a lot with this, and even more if the character\'s player is
co-operative.  For example, here are some possibilities:

> Will everything unconscious be revealed for her?

Maybe.  If you (preferably with the co-operation of the player in question)
can come up with a suitable horrible episode from her childhood that has
been repressed ever since.  She can learn about it, and the next portion of
the campaign plot can revolve around resolving this - revenge, given the
nature of Traveller players, is a possiblity.

> Will she goes insane?

Maybe.  This one would require the close co-operation of the player - If she
goes insane, I certainly hope that her companions would try to help her.
The next few portions of the plot could revolve around locating a cure
(there must be one, but finding it may be difficult and dangerous - perhaps
only the Zhodani can help).  The character herself will have to be played as
in insane women - you and the player will have to work out just how crazy,
and how often.  It might be most interesting if there are moments when she\'s
almost normal, and moments when she\'s totally helpless (or worse!).

> Or will she aquire spiritual enlightenment?

Maybe.  I can\'t think of as many good angles on this one as on the others.
But it\'s possible, and if you want to take the campaign into spiritual and
religious matters, this would be a hook.  This can certainly be a rationale
for entirely re-thinking the character\'s personality: perhaps as a result of
her spirirtual awakening, she becomes a dedicated pacifist and/or
vegetarian.  Perhaps she feels a need to enlighten others, and she (and the
party) are persecuted for it - the only thing more despised than a false
phophet is a true one.

> Is it possible at all?

Sure, why not?

> Or is there a danger for an infinite recursive loop?
> A finite recursive loop?

Maybe.  Having the character go catatonic or into a coma wouldn\'t be very
interesting for her player.  This could be an excuse for skipping a few
sessions, though.  Bring it up as a possible risk, though - so that the
player can feel good for sucessfully avoiding _that_ risk.

Well, I\'m not a Franco-Canadian, just a poor Alberta boy who sometimes 
reads the French side of the cereal box in the morning.  I think what he 
is trying to say to the to fellow who combined O Tannenbaum with O Canada 
is something like: Sseeing as how people don\'t speak German on the list 
they shouldn\'t use German or they might get flamed??

Not to sure on this, so don\'t quote me.

Not _too_ far from here is a stone viaduct built by the Baltimore
and Ohio railroad company on their original main line west.  The viaduct was
built well over 150 years ago, and still carries the traffic on the
B&O\'s modern-day successor, CSX, despite the fact that trains are a _lot_
heavier now than they were when the bridge was designed.

Let\'s just accept those numbers for now.  We\'ll set aside the issue of
compensation for the 30G (or whatever) push.  Lets take a simple scenario.
Carrier has no speed advantage over the target at T0 (worst case, but not
unreasonable if this tactic is going to be important).  Carrier launches 6G
fighters at 1 light-second (in BR terms, this is damn close - TL15 lasers
are all going to have this as effective range).  Enemy detects launch,
decides to evade, thrusts at 6G away from pursuers.  That means your only
speed advantage is your 500m/s.  At 500 m/s, it will take you 600,000
seconds to close the 300,000,000 m gap.

Time is really on your side with acceleration.  While velocity increases
linearly with time, distance covered goes up with t^2.

Yes, and since fighters are more likely to be built with all the crew in
tanks, It should have about a 3-G advantage.

Pay your money, pick your future history.  I have my won theories as to
where the 6G figure came from.

The fighter advantage NOT really reflected in the rules is maneuverability
- -- the ability to do a 180 without subjecting the crew to excessive G
forces.  In a fighter, we can (SHOULD!) place the pilot at the centre of
rotation.  In a larger ship, some of the crew are going to be at
extremities, and subjected to a centrifugal force proportional to length of
the ship and (IIRC) the square of the angular velocity required to
accomplish the turn.  Dispite G-Compensation, this presents a definite upper
limit to the rate at which a large ship can turn, which can be virtually
ignored by fighters.

 Rember, with modern fighters your talking about a few SECONDS at _most_
at even 9gs.. With traveler ships, you must rember that each "it\'s just
3gs over" is a _half hour_ of being 3 gees over. Your heart would be gone

[Glenn\'s intelligent racially relative comments snipped]

I think that a human psionic attempting self probing would encounter
exactly what she expected to see, literally.  If something is hidden from
her "normally" by her subconcious mind, using an ability of the same mind
would not remove the block.

I would think of it as trying to lift yourself by your own bootstraps.
You just can\'t find anyplace to stand :)  Or perhaps like using a mirror
to see the back of your head.  It\'s still the same head, just from another
perspective.

Now, certain circumstances might change this, could a multiple personality
schizophrenic perceive one of (or the) other personalities? (this has
interesting implications...) Perhaps mind
relaxing drugs or some other altered state would allow some deeper probing
(not self-hypnosis though, all your self-defenses are still in place under
self-hypnosis unless some way is found of fooling yourself).  I think that
in order to relax enough defenses to allow this kind of probing, the
person would be pretty much unable to *do* the probing.  Maybe a
self-destructive person could do things that a more stable personality
could not.

Just as we are always hearing our own voice with hearing, I would think
that a telepathic person would always be listening to their own thoughts
(albiet a bit distorted, just as our voices are via the vibration of our
skull to our own ears - that\'s why your own recorded voice sounds wierd),
and nothing unknown can be found via self-telepathy.

Just a little pop-psychology to brighten your day.

Cute, but you cannot compare the occasional 9 or 10 G\'s pulled by an air
pilot to 6G of *constant* accelleration.  And again, I do believe (no
books here) that the limit was 6G before inertial dampers failed to help.

Yep, just next door. It\'s interesting to note that soon after the first
transatlantic wireless experiment on Signal Hill, the Canadian government
lured Marconi to Canada where he set up shop in Cape Breton (northeastern
Nova Scotia).  Marconi ran a commercial transatlantic wireless service
from just a few miles from here.  I guess you could say the first
commercial long range wireless communication service was in Canada. ;-) 
Incidentally, Alexander Graham Bell and co. also played in this area with
experimental hydrofoils, sheep breeding and airplanes earlier on in the
century.

On the other hand, if the character uses telekinesis to mind probe,

The 10G+ "pull" you refer to happens to modern fighter pilots during tight
maneuvers and not during periods of rapid acceleration.  Vessels in
outerspace do not suffer this type of stress since maneuvering does not
change a ship\'s vector.  Aircraft, on the other hand, make use of an
atmosphere and an airfoil to maneuver.  Even the steam catapults on modern
aircraft carriers do not submit the pilot to this kind of acceleration.
The 6G limit is for maximum acceleration purposes of T-Plate and HEPlaR
drives only.

Now if you are comparing the minumum hull rating in Traveller (regarding
maximum acceleration) with modern day fighters, perhaps someone that owns a
copy of MT\'s COACC might be able to help out.  Anyone?

 Does it really state in FF&S that 6G is a limit? I can\'t recall 
having read that. I quess I\'ll have to read the relevant pages 
again. 

 Another question I have is how many G\'s are the shuttle astronauts
exposed to at take-off? I guess this would be a better comparison
than to a fighter pilot. Say they can take 3G without problems, that
means you can have a figter with 6G compensators, G-suit adds say 2G
for a total of 11G\'s. That is as long as the pilot is sitting at the
rotational axis. Is these numbers fair or what. I don\'t want to start
designing fighters for my campaign without more knowledge, so I turn 
to all of you out there. This far all I have seen is speculation.
Does anybody have any sources on how much the human body can take?

Talking about swimming pools. Here in Norway their tearing down
whole wall of a building, just because the swimmingpool in it 
were 5 centimeters to short for international standards, so it 
couldn\'t be used for tournaments. This is going to cost a lot 
of money. I wonder if the company or the arcitects will pay this?

The fact that there were Vilani Pacification Campaigns implies that the

Most \'encyclopedia\' material I have for Traveller (which is from MT and 
TNE) has two parts:  the part that the players read, and the referees\' 
section.  Only the referees\' section contains the Actual God\'s Own Truth, 
which is why players are discouraged from reading (or using) it.

Having them get tripped up because they FAILED to read it, even when 
given numerous hints, is at least as fun.  The players in my current 
campaign used to get burned all the time because they didn\'t do enough 
research (and this still happens sometimes).  Now they mostly get burned 
because they didn\'t apply critical thinking to the library data which 
they did manage to read.

I don\'t think that there is any extant Terran nation that makes a good

ultraconservative vegans (militant vegetarians, not those tentacle-limbed 
guys) on amyl nitrate...

Doh!  Gotta stop thinking in CT terms.  I never really agreed with the 6G
limit from CT & MT and I do like the "tons of thrust" style of TNE.  The
maximum Gee rating of any hull in QSDS is 6 (including the "Really Big Hull
List").  SSDS does not make any mention of a limit, however (nor does
FF&S).  Just a little bit of canon that spands the many versions of
Traveller....

>  Another question I have is how many G\'s are the shuttle astronauts
> exposed to at take-off? I guess this would be a better comparison

I believe I read somewhere that the astronauts experience somewhere in the
neighbourhood of about 3 G\'s of acceleration (1 of these Gees coming from
the Earth\'s gravity of course).  The shuttle goes through a LOT of fuel
during this time and it only has to travel a relatively short distance, so
it might not really be a fair comparison either  :-)

Is the 6G limit just a piece of canon that was verbally carried into the
TNE universe by players of previous versions or is there really such a
ruling?  The G-compensation tables in FF&S on p 77 only go up to 11G\'s
anyway....

Well, ya\'ll may remember I\'m not enamored of fighters, but there are a few of
points that need to be made...

1.  Given 6g compensators, then 9g has the effect of 3g..not 9!
While 3g would be uncomfortable a conditioned ( and that includes chemically
conditioned ), and properly positioned pilot could
handle 3g\'s for several hours.

2.  Excess g\'s above 6 would contribute to a ship\'s agility.
Agility would involve jinking and quick turns with timings in the seconds NOT
half-hour.  A few seconds at 15g *could* be
survived..given gravity compensation..and that would make *big*
differences in combat.

3.  Your reference to half-hour relates to set game turns.  I don\'t play
wargames with Traveller, I roleplay.  Half-hour\'s are fine for a wargame, but
not for roleplaying a combat. 

Finally, a question...if your fighter\'s cockpit was flooded with water
providing neutral buoyancy for the pilot, and the computer system controlled
both the grav compensators and water pressure, couldn\'t a pilot handle g
forces in the 2 digit range?

 I relize that, and it is possible with stock FFnS, but there are - diff
mods.

 Hmm 15gs would make a big diff in dodging direct fire and KKMs, the
question is how do you know _when_ to apply the thrust?

 Rember, the viability of everything and anything is based purley on game
rules. This is not to say that you don\'t have the right and the duty to
change it if it dosen\'t aggree with you.

        It does not say that 6G is the upper limit for a ship. What it does
do is describe the game effects of uncompensated G\'s, that is G\'s above the
intertial compensation .

        And it does not describe anywhere a limit on T-Plate and HEPlaR
acceleration. T-Plate maybe you could wave your hands at and justify. But
since HEPlaR is just fancy reaction drive, Reality [(C) 4,004BC, God] laughs
at your feeble handwaving.

        Actually, the whole French posting thing was in response to Glenn\'s

        Yeah... the "deathrattle" line is just something of an inside joke
:).  Strangely enough, I was also named for a greatuncle (my mother\'s), and
a godfather...

        In passing, if you think Standard North American English speakers
have a hard time pronouncing either "Darroch" or "Reddoch" properly, you
should hear Cantonese speakers.  On the other hand, my Cantonese
pronunciation is far, far worse, so..:)

Norman Spinrad wrote a fairly relevant short story by the name of
_Carcinoma Angels_ in which a very motivated person sought to fight off
his cancer through an internal battle.   I was kinda like a major acid
trip/soul searching, and he did manage to fight off his cancer...he just
never woke up----he got stuck inside himself, so to speak.   I can\'t recall
where it showed up, IIRC it was in an Arthur C. Clarke edited short story
anthology (incidentally, with another story that would shed some insight
on the Virus debates...).

Dole (Habitable Planets for Man) quotes some experiments on subjects WITHOUT
G SUITS but seated (averages)

5 G - 2 minutes to blackout
4 G - 8 minutes
3 G - an hour IN SOME SUBJECTS

Mobility was also interesting.  Subject had to move 7.5 feet under various
accelerations.  Average took 1.85 seconds under 1 G, 21.86 seconds under
3.16 G (did I mention they were allowed to crawl?) STRONGEST took 18.15
seconds under 4G (rest could not move)

On task completion -- average of 5 times as long to put on a parachute at 3
G as at 1G.

These numbers should be kept in mind when using over-G operation. I believe
FF&S gives some advantage for workstation, g-tank etc (totalling about 3G
max IIRC).  But damage control is gonna be a b****.  

While some high numbers have been quoted for fighter pilots in modern
G-suits, keep in mind that sudden lateral accelerations can be very
dangerous.  I knew a man who had flown a Spitfire in the Battle of Britain.
Did a high-G roll to get out of the way of the bullets.  He survived (much
to the doctor\'s surprise) and eventually most of his internal organs
returned to their accustomed places, but he never flew a fighter again.

My own guess (not backed up by traveller rules, but how I would play it) for
Over-G (that is, acceleration over compensation numbers)

1. Over-G is endurable on a fighter, but causes severe fatigue with matching
performance loss over time.  On a large ship, Over-G maneuvers cause a
percentaige of crew casualties, based primarily on alert status and damage
control.  Also causes increased crew fatigue.

2. No damage control activities during over-g maneuvers.  Crew casulaties on
large ships are multiplied by the number of G\'s over compensation
(workstations rip out, crew hit by flying debris.

While we\'re on a roll:

Ever notice that most ship deck plans have down facing lateral to the line
of acceleration -- rather like driving a car (or a Star Trek Starship, which
is much the same thing).  Seems nuts to me.  Bring her up to one G and you
are spending 1G to make down the floor, and another G to neutralize forward
thrust. Im MY universe, designs like that have an effective G compensation 1
less than they are designed for.  

Even if you don\'t do that, remember that as you go over G compensation down
slowly shifts from the floor, to the corner, to the back wall (say, is that
your coffee cup accelerating toward the captain at 3G?).  SO a 3
G-compensation ship doing 6G with a conventional design? Down is at about 45
degrees.  May as well stay in your chair, there aint NOTHING flat to stand
on.  What does that do to, say, the automatic missile reload system?  Not
only do things get heavier, they get heavier in directions they did not
start out being heavy in.  

This suggests that some systems should be more failure-prone at high G\'s.

[Stewart reminds us of the hazards of hull breaches (and their effects on 
 the hull grid) before, during and after jump transition]
 
I believe one of the "Old Timer" anecdotes in the SOM involves the loss 
of the ship\'s medic-- a minute flaw in one of the capacitors (zuchai 
crystals) resulted in a hole being blown into the hull, the intrusion of 
the jump field into the medic\'s quarters, and the subsequent loss of the 
medic.  What happened to him/her?  I don\'t know.  He/she probably 
precipitated randomly out of J-space over the next week.  Ever hear about 
the battle rider that accidentally detached from its tender and contacted 
the field bubble during jump?  Somebody found part of one of its airlocks 
hundreds of years later and quite a few parsecs away.  Jump Space is Bad 
For You.

Of course, there can also be errors that, although subtler, are no less 
catastrophic.  In "The Madness Effect," an adventure published in one of 
the Challenge magazines (#75, I believe), a minute error in the 
computations led to a flaw in the jump field bubble, which began to 
unravel during the course of the trip through j-space, as the wierd 
physics of j-space began to leak in.  The ship in question became a very 
bad place to be, but actually survived the trip more or less intact.

In my campaign, the players have actually gotten into serious trouble for 
ejecting material from the ship while in jumpspace.  Of course, if the 
RQS inspectors ever learned that it was a rival, rather than a few cubic 
meters of garbage, that had gone jump-swimming, then they\'d have been in 
even more trouble...

Actually, you\'re not too far off canon, although there are no \'official\' 
designs that I\'m aware of that can pull better than 6G acceleration.  
With FF&S, this limitation becomes more and more artificial but, still, 
nobody seemed willing to break the 6G barrier.  At TL-15, inertial 
compensators can offset 6Gs and have everybody still moving about 
freely.  If they\'re strapped down in their workstations, the compensation 
figure is 7Gs.  What does this mean for small craft (like fighters) that 
have their crew strapped down in acceleration couches?  It means that 
even the most out of shape fighter pilots, not wearing g-suits, can 
regularly pull 9G maneuvers, because they\'re only actually feeling two or 
three Gs.  Imagine if all of the creature comforts afforded contemporary 
fighter pilots (excellent physical shape, reclined acceleration couches, 
g-suits) were combined with inertial compensators.  Fighters could be 
capable of incredible acceleration without fear of causing their pilots 
to black out.  
 
[what I\'ve just typed pretty much mirrors Pete\'s next comment, which I 
 snipped] 

There are designs for missiles that exceed the 6G barrier.  For that 
matter, the external \'pod\' that\'s maneuvered about by the gravitic 
manipulator (tractor/repulsor combination) on a Darrian Patrol Cruiser 
(from "Regency Sourcebook") can be pushed at 12Gs (although the inertial 
compensator can only offset 6 or 7 Gs).

The balance that needs to be struck for maximum playability, in my 
opinion, is one where large capital ships (battleships, dreadnoughts, and 
cruisers) are not invalidated by fighters and carriers, but where there 
is still a niche that fighters can fill.  Currently, there seems to be no 
significant cost advantage of fighter/carrier fleets as opposed to 
battleship-based fleets.  The difference is in how the fleet commanders 
utilize those respective assets.  My \'wild-ass guess\' of employment 
involves battleships being the main striking arm of a fleet that does the 
close-in brawling with the opposition, while the carrier component of a 
fleet provides a stand-off capability, using its fighters to locate the 
enemy and engage him from a distance.

I hope you\'re refering to the other Derek, Derek Wildstar that is.  By 
the way nice spelling of your name there Derek, pretty classy name.

I haven\'t commented on this, yet...  I\'ve been giving it a fair amount of 
thought.  I think you should be able to do it, but not without 
supervision otherwise you might get lost in there.  Or you might 
encounter something you didn\'t particularly want to find.  Though this is 
up to the GM as to what the player finds.  I think the largest problem 
would be figuring out how to break the connection once initiated, it\'s 
kind of a loop that you might never find an end to.

Don\'t try this at home kids.

Judging from all the capital letters, you seem pretty adamant, so let\'s 
drag out FF&S and a calculator and try to come up with a design where the 
surface is dominated by HEPlaR thrusters.  Before I begin, though, let me 
point out that I was referring to earlier combat systems when I cited 
designs for capital ships which had just as much acceleration as 
fighters.  Keep in mind that FF&S was the first design system that paid 
any heed whatsoever to surface area.  I think that I may have invalidated 
your argument already, but just to be sure, let\'s crank out the figures 
for a 1,000,000 displacement ton sphere with 6G HEPlaR thrusters.

Why a sphere?  It has the lowest surface area/volume ratio.  According to 
FF&S, our usable surface area is 274,000 square meters.  Actually, on 
checking back, I find that configuration does not affect usable surface 
area, so what I\'ve just done is select the most surface area-efficient 
design.  Silly me.

For simplicity\'s sake, we assume that the weight/volume ratio does not 
exceed fifteen tons per cubic meter.  That lets us use the 10 Tt per 
displacement ton formula.  The result:  required thrust is 10,000,000 tons.

Hull surface area used by HEPlaR thrusters is Tt / 200.  The result:  
50,000 square meters are used.  This leaves us 224,000 square meters for 
other external fittings.  Contra-gravity generators, if used, will take 
up 27,400 square meters, leaving us 196,600 square meters.  Granted, 
we\'ve only got 71.8% of our original surface area left, but I suspect 
that we\'re going to be hard pressed to use ALL of it up.

BTW:  Thruster Plates, if used, have the same surface area formula 
(Tt/200).

These ratios are actually constant for all given displacements, so all 6G 
ships that do not weigh more than fifteen tons per cubic meter will have 
just over 70% useful surface area after HEPlaR thrusters (or thruster 
plates) and CG lifters are considered.  Variations in other systems 
requiring surface area, such as communicators, sensors, and weapons, are 
too dynamic to consider in this discussion, although I encourage anyone 
who came up with a viable design, but suffered a shortage of surface area 
during the design process that required compromises, to share their 
examples with the class.

My original point was to correct someone who started talking about 
surface-going vessels while I was talking about space vessels.  Maybe 
your problem is that you\'ve designed too many starships from deckplans by 
component fitting.  By using the actual design rules as they were meant 
to be used, you\'ll find that my point still stands.  It\'s important to 
note in the case of HEPlaR designs, or any other design that has a 
thruster system requiring reaction mass, a large ship, although capable 
of similar acceleration, may have to lay off the throttle more than a 
fighter would for fear of running out of reaction mass.

These are definitely special cases.  The comment I was correcting was 
about the use of tame Virii in shipboard computers on a routine basis.  
In "Vampire Fleets", the Reformation Coalition encounters a Virus strain 
that is not intent on annihilating or dominating mankind, but on 
peacefully coexisting with them.  It is the \'children\' of this strain 
that came to inhabit the central computers of many RC vessels.

The ironies are fascinating.  It seems that no matter how much Norris 
wanted to \'play it straight\' with the people, he really couldn\'t.  Of 
course, some of the more radical propositions regarding domesticated 
Virii, such as using them to control the Project Blackheart strike 
cruisers, were struck down by Norris himself.  The Regency Artificial 
Sentience Analysis Committee (RASAC) did keep many virus strains, some 
tame, others not, around for study, and this proved to be a major source 
of embarassment when some of their papers were leaked to the press in 1201.

Well, as much as previously published Imperialhistory can be taken as
true in respect of T4, this isn\'t correct.  The Vilani are suppossed
to have joined the Imperium shortly after it was declared (suggesting
that they were instrumental in supporting it\'s formation), and the
Vilani Pacification Campaign several decades later was against parts
of the Vilani *Domain* (Dagudashaag?), and was carried out by the
(Vilani) Archduke of Vland.  In the same way, the Sylean Pacification
Campaign didn\'t pacify the Sylean home worlds, but parts of the Sylean
Domain.

I think one of the Traveller\'s Digests included a concise history of
the Imperium, which I think was predominantly previously published
information combined into a coherent whole, with perhaps some new
ideas.  Nice picture of an Emperor (Cleon the Mad?) on the Iridium
Throne, I seem to recall.

     Your comments about deck-plans were also interresting.  Back in the 
     early eighties, I was looking for an SF RPG and my local games shop 
     recommended Star Frontiers over Traveller (hey, I was young and naive 
     - I believed him).  All the deck plans for that game were done with 
     the decks perpendicular to the thrust line, which was a nice realistic 
     touch, but I still preferred the "look" of the Traveller deck plans I 
     had seen.
     
     One idea I had (although I\'m sure it\'s been thought of before, and I 
     just can\'t remember where from) is to have the crew section, or the 
     cockpit of a fighter, be able to rotate in all planes (like the belly 
     turret of a B17, or the VR setup in The Lawnmower Man), allowing the 
     G-forces felt to always be towards the floor.  This would have the 
     advantage that acceleration couches would always be supporting you in 
     the best way, and avoid the nasty effects of negative-G.  It would 
     hopefully also remove the disorientating effects of evasive 
     manouevring.

Hey, that\'s nothing. Ever hear the *real* story behind "Love Canal"
(the infamous toxic waste site)?

The companies that disposed of waste there took a *lot* of precautions.
They bought an old canal (and the surrounding right of way). They
repaired and reinforced the reinforced concrete lining. After they
dumped in the waste, they poured a reinforced concrete lid. Then they
dumped lots of dirt on top.

How\'d the stuff get loose? The city or county engineer *ignored* the
warnings on the maps and condemned the property so they could use it as
a right of way to run a major *sewer line* through. Naturally they
ripped the hell out of the casing to run the pipes through. 

But guess who got blamed for the leakage? Not the city...

This ranks right up there with the idiots in Utah who *over the
objections of the company* rezoned the land across the street from them
and put in a grade school. Why did the company object? Because they are
one of the country\'s largest manufacturers of *explosives*!

To get back to Traveller though, here\'s a neat scenario:

The players are trying to survey a planet that got depopulated during
the Long Night. They find a map hidden in the ruins of a government
office (say hidden behind a false panel in a file cabinet). It\'s in bad
shape, but they can still read it. It\'s a map of one of the more remote
areas of the planet, a definite wilderness area. But there are some
cryptic markings on it, indicating that *somethhing* is there, but the
markings don\'t say what it is. But it\'s ovbvious, both from the way the
map was hidden, and the fact that the notes are *so* cryptic, that
whatever it is, it was supposed to be *very* secret.

If they check out the area, they will find traces that indicate that
someone did some *major* construction here, then went to a lot of
trouble to make it look "normal" again.

Depending on what sort of sensors they have, they\'ll get various
indications. There are neutrino readings from some areas for instance.
And using "sounding charges" like geologists use will reveal that there
is some sort of *large* complex buried there. It appears to be built to
withstand a major war, and the areas where the tunnels led to the
surface seem to have been sealed *very* thouroghly.

I\'ll give you pretty good odds that your average player comes up with
one of the following explanations:

1. Planetary defence center
2. Archives
3. treasure repository
4. the mother of all fallout shelters, with important people in cold
   sleep until "after the war"
5. Doomsday weapon installation.
6. Ancient installation that the goverment hid from the people (shades
   of "Area 51" :-)

Or many other variations on these themes.

But having read my comments about Love Canal, I bet you\'ve figured it
out already. It\'s where the goverment buried all the really toxic
waste. The neutrinos are from the decay of nuclear waste. It\'s secret
because they didn\'t want the environmentalists after them.

I expect that typical players will either contaminate the hell out of
themselves, or manage to set set off some of the explosive/flammable
stuff leaking out of corroding drums.  :-)

In case you haven\'t guessed, I am fond of setting up situations where
the players get into trouble because of theor pre-conceived notions.

Your heart or my heart might. But check out some of the tests they did
on the early astronauts as part of the screening process. Like extended
runs in the centrifuge, seeing who could handle how many gees for how
long. 

And for what it\'s worth, the acceleration on things like the Gemini and
Apoolo missions *started* at several gees and *increased* as the fuel
burned off. Burnout accelerations were routinely over 10 gees.

Part of the difference between what astronauts can handle and what
fighter pilots can handle is due to the *direction* of the acceleration.

Even a pretty out of shape person can handle 2 gees for a *long* time
as long as they are "lying down". Even 3 gees for 10 minutes or so is
considered to be within the reach of "ordinary" people. That\'s one of
the design goals for craft intended for "routinely" carrying people to
orbit. If you can keep the peak acceleration under 3 gees, then even
your grandmother can ride it...

Please note that many carnival rides *routinely* exceed 3 gees!
Anything that has you upside down, but feeling at least one gee "up" is
subjecting you to 3 gees at the bottom of the spin. Based on my last
experience with the one where you stand in "stalls" around the rim of a
big wheel, which is mounted on the end of a tilt arm, I\'d say that 3
gess for half an hour is not that big a deal. After all, the spin that
up until it feels like you are lying on your back, then they start
tilting the wheel until it is vertical. For safety, they have you
experiencing about 1.5 gee "up" when you are at the top of the wheel.
That requires a spin that gives 2.5 gees "out" (2.5 out - 1  from
gravity equals 1.5). That gives you 3.5 at the bottom. It *ain\'t* that
much of a strain.

Look for NASA data on astronaut training and selection. But I\'ll go on
record as saying that anybody in decent condition should be able to
take 3gs reclining for a *long* time.

IMHO this is reasonable - I was primarily commenting on the first few
responses I saw which basically said "no" without even considering the plot
potential of the idea.

It\'s also worthwhile to note that the particular person in question had both
Telepathy and Awareness.  I\'d suggest that (since awareness is a psi
discipline that specifically affects the user\'s self) this combination would be
sufficient to do a self-mindprobe.

>Self probe would be a "Special" talent in my Imperium.

A long time ago, I made a large list of "special" talents (with the help of
an old out-of-print RPG from FGU called _PSI World_).  That wasn\'t on the
list, but it\'s not a bad idea.

This is a good point - and one that I glossed over earlier.  Perhaps the
character makes the connection, finds what they were looking for, and then
can\'t figure out how to get back.

The other PCs, meanwhile, begin to become concerned about their friend.
Perhaps they need to find a Psi Institute (the same one that trained their
friend?), convince them of their bona-fides, and get assistance that way.

Perhaps an expedition into Zhodani territory to find the appropriate healer
there.  Or perhaps one of the PCs can figure something else out - a strong
enough external stimulus might do it - but what could be strong enough that
wouldn\'t risk serious injury to the comatose character?  Maybe the party\'s
doctor can find a Psi-supressant drug that will break the connection.

All things to consider - and any one of them is enough to drive the whole
next play session.  Then there\'s the ramifications of what the character
learned by examining the back of her own skull - hopefully enough plot
material to fill up several more sessions.


The important thing to remember is that we\'re telling a story with the
campaign - and everything that the players do (or try to do) should be
considered in relation to the story.
- - Does it further the story in some way?
- - Does it help develop the characters?
- - Does it provide a new plot direction for the story?
- - Does it help tie up old unanswered questions from previous stories?
- - Is it interesting and fun for the group?
Obviously, a degree of internal consistency is needed in order to maintain
the "suspension of disbelief" that\'s important to keeping the players (and
referee) interested in the story.  Beyond that, consider everything that
_hasn\'t_ been said or played out to be fluid.  It\'s OK to change plans based
on what the players have done, or will do.

Star Wars is a great example: in the first movie, we\'ve got no clues that
Vader is Luke\'s and Leia\'s father (and no idea that Luke and Leia are
brother and sister).  While I don\'t know when Lucas decided this, in a RPG
it\'s certainly reasonable to add this detail in mid-game: it doesn\'t change
anything that\'s gone before, and it provides a nice twist to the storyline,
and drives several important elements of the plot in later movies.

I heartily recommend "fluid" plotting for Traveller referees.  Keep notes
about what\'s happend and what you\'re planning, but review and revise them
between sessions.  Don\'t let yourself be trapped into what you\'d planned
and decided weeks ago - long as it doesn\'t contradict the facts (but you
can contradict unsupported assumptions). 

An example: The players jumped from Ruie to Regina a few weeks ago, and (for
some reason) they took a suspicious interest in a slightly-shabby but
otherwise undistinguished passenger (perhaps it was because he paid his fare
in cash - actual Imperial money - not electronic credit).  He said his name
was Howie, and that he was a salesman for a firm on Regina. 

Perhaps at the time you\'d been thinking that he was a (more than slightly
shady) independent arms broker afilliated with Instellarms, returning to
Regina with the profits from his latest scam.  But when the players
dropped him off in Regina without getting arrested themselves, they
promptly forgot about him and didn\'t bother to do a background check.  Now
you can turn him into Howard Mews, eccentric multi-billionare (and he just
so happens to be the patron the PCs are about to meet).

  I assume you left out the word "recently" in the above post.  Actually, 
engineers understood the problem almost immediatly.  The failure was due 
to wind loading, which set up oscillations in the bridge deck.  
Then-current design theory had assumed that such oscillations would be 
negligable, allowing the bridge deck to be built without stiffening.  
This lighter construction meant that long-span suspension bridges could 
be built considerably more cheaply.  Within months of the Tacoma failure, 
other bridges were being re-designed to stiffen the deck, and older 
bridges were reinforced as design formulae were changed.

  I recently read a book on the history of bridge design by the historian 
of technology Henry Petroski.  He cited a study done the in the 1970s, 
that found that major bridge failures occur in thirty year cycles.  The 
explanation?  Turns out that each generation of engineers tends to 
forget the mistakes of the previous generation, and push designs too far, 
resulting in a major failure.  This has some interesting potential for 
roleplaying scenarios, I think.

Actaully I made this mistake too and Dave Golden corrected me.  Hull form 
does effect surface area.

"SURFACE AREA:  Surface area in square meters is the hull material volume

This is an absolutely evil scenario.  There\'s a streak of wicked genius

ARGHHHHH!!!!!!!!
Multiple personality (or dissociative identity, to give the condition its proper
name) and schizophrenia *are not* the same thing, they ain\'t even close.
Schizophrenics don\'t have alternate personalities. Since schizophrenia is
organic in origin, mindprobing a schizophrenic is likely to be much like
mindprobing an alien. The brain is biochemically different.

Now, mindprobing a multiple personality (MP) is different. The alternate
personality states of MP are the product of dissociation (its like
daydreaming taken to the Nth degree) and exist in the concious mind,
not the subconcious mind. This is why MPs can learn to be aware of
their different personality states. Therefore probing a MP is most likely
to get you in contact with the personality state currently "active". If you
did manage to contact one of the "dormant" states, you would have
in effect triggered what\'s called a "switch", i.e. replacing the current
active state with another (causing great distress and confusion to the
MP if they\'re not aware of the conditions existance).

Now this is interesting. If the person is doing a selfprobe (I\'d make this
a special talent myself) and is a MP and unaware of that fact. They could
trigger a switch. This would undoubtedly be extremely traumatic. I\'d plunk
for collapse into unconciousness with hysterical amnesia after, quite
possibly with the creation of a new personality state as an additional
result. However I\'d also say given the massive complexity of multiple
personality disorder it would not make a suitable roleplay character.

This is some great stuff...

Actually, I can see this in the ship design for a PC starship.  They 
have experimental TL16 technology in some places...but those systems 
are subject to a lot greater risk of breakdown...the result of 
working with experimental technology...

Lots of opportunity to drive PC\'s crazy...which is generally a good 
thing...  :-)

Try these (pronounciation at end):

	Myfanwe (Welsh)
	Cholmondely (English)
or even:
	Jaques (English, actually Cornish, we think)

2.	RESTRICTED J-DRIVE SALES

Now, here is an interesting topic. Does the Imperium restrict jump drives?

Some discussion points:

- - There is virtally no need to restrict drives. High-jump also means 
high-volume; these drives are unprofitable for the average trader.

- - Free traders only need j-1 IF ON A MAIN. If in a j-2 cluster, a far
trader is essential, or worse a deep trader (j-3) may be required. Al
Morai use j-4. Only the Fleet Courier seems to be j-6.  [ASIDE: Al Morai
uses large j-4 traders. Presumably, by following the xboat communications
routes, you can tell your PC\'s that Al Morai finds it easier to send info
ahead, allowing their factors longer lead times to buy spec cargo.]

- - Thanks, Stewart, I had forgotten the Tukera reference to private j-6 
couriers. Caradoc LIC (based at Tavonni) uses a network of j-6 Fleet 
Couriers (SEE _Fighting Ships_) to ferry high-powered business execs to 
Tavonni for high-level, face-to-face conferences... for a premium, of course.

- - The old Games Workshop _IISS Ship Files_ (UK 1981) includes the 
Excalibur-class Express Packet Boat (Bilstein Yards, Glisten), a j-4 
courier. Note that the reference to "we need to know where this bird\'s 
engines are from" refers to a pair of streamlined j-2 engines (not j-6), 
now attached to an unstreamlined tramp freighter. BTW, the idea that 
"power plants act as psi shields" - what I though was a TNE idea - is 
mentioned in this book, w/specific reference to the Zho Tiaflfiet-class 
Patrol Frigate.

What do you think? Do you feel that high-jump drives would be restricted 
by the Imperium?

3.	FIGHTERS

Pretty simple reason for the 6G limit: "before FF&S, HG was". And HG only 
had thruster plates. And the max acceleration from thruster plates is 6G. 
*Correction* - Charles has reminded me that the _Starship Operator\'s 
Manual_ allows engineers to overpower their drives by a percentage. Just 
the sort of thing that a space-based Chuck Yeager might try.

And the "6G acceleration vs 6G acceleration" thing (uncatchable ships) is 
why I modified Marc\'s _Missiles_ Special Supplement to create 10G 
missiles as "standard missiles", with Navy missiles being 21G. This way, 
you could virtually ignore _Mayday_\'s past:present:future markers for 
missiles and just play using HG combat rules (missiles fire and hit in 
the same turn).

Les said:

>Ever notice that most ship deck plans have down facing lateral to the 
line of acceleration...

Except the big ships, such as the good old AHL\'s.

4.	FLAIR

>Even game-geeks need FLAIR every-damn-once-in-a-while....

Which is why the "Traveller Technical Architecture" became "Fire, Fusion 
and Steel" - now that is a way cool name.

BTW, I looked at the Tavonni RICE Paper and discovered I omitted a 
"historical" reference:

"It is not as though the Star Vikings invented anything new. They simply 
refined old techniques under the direction of their Hiver puppet masters. 
Tavonni, for example, was a bootstrap operation long before the 
Reformation Coalition knew what the term meant.

IMHO Telepathy is redundant for *self* probing.  You don\'t need to 
be a telepath to find out what\'s going on in your *own* skull. The 
Awareness would be useful for putting oneself in the proper  
trance-state (auto-hypnosis, meditation, etc. ) for digging into the  
less accessible pieces of one\'s own mind...  
 
IMHO, telepathic training involves getting to know your own mind 
intimately first--after all, if you don\'t understand yourself, how 
will you ever understand others?  This would seem to be a particularly 
important pre-requisite for Probe--comprehension of any kind of 
communication requires common experiences between the sender and 
the receiver.  To understand someone else\'s subconscious, you would 
have had to learn your way around your own, first. 
 
In my campaign, I would answer with the previous information: to wit, 
"exploration of your own mind was part of your training in Telepathy, 
you\'ve already done this".  IMHO, in general, self-knowledge should be  
an enlightening, liberating thing, not damaging.

 AUTHOR       Ellison, Harlan.
 TITLE        Dangerous visions; 33 original stories.
 SERIES       Doubleday science fiction.
 EDITION      [1st ed.]
 PUBLISHER    Garden City, N.Y., Doubleday, 1967.
 SUBJECTS     Science fiction.
 NOTE         Sequel: Again, dangerous visions.

	Ellison was the editor, in this case...there is another story in 
there as well, which ties in well with Virus: \'Auto da fe\'...which 
involved herds of wild Buicks. The author escapes me now, John 
Brunner, perhaps?

	The sequel, IMO is still good, but weaker; the first cut of the 
stories clearly got into the first volume.

	It should be standard reading for any SF fan.  It helped set the 
standards for \'New Wave\' SF like Campbell set the standards for the 
\'Golden Age\'.

*grin* Noticed it years ago... 
Ever considered what happens in a Type S Scout accelerating at 2Gs 
if the floor fields & the anti-acc cut out?  From the bridge hatch,  
it\'s suddenly a multi-story drop at 2Gs to splatter on the engine room\'s 
forward bulkhead... 
 
Safety tip: Don\'t make the "floor" parallel to the direction of thrust 
in a military vessel.  Ships that go "in harm\'s way" occasionally get 
holes shot thru the anti-acceleration gravitics...  Or lose power to  
them while the reaction drive is still burning.  Oops! 
 
The _Azhanti High Lightning_, the _Broadsword_ and the _P.F. Sloane_  
Fleet Escort are the only "classic" designs that I\'ve seen that 
have the "floor" PERPENDICULAR to the line of thrust (i.e., "safe"). 
Type S Scout, Type A Free Trader, Type A2 Far Trader, Type R SubMerchant, 
Type M Liner, and most of the FASA deck plans are instant deathtraps 
if you suddenly lose acceleration compensation.   
 
Sadistic Refs might want to use this someday >:-)   
Just make sure whoever you want to kill is in a long fore-and-aft  
passageway when the compensation gives out.

You get the same effect in a modern-day fighter plane.  MILSPEC for

There we were, working as crew on a Type R.  We were hijacked.  As
they were cutting through to the bridge I turned off grav comp while
running at 2gs.  No more hijackers.  The ref was not a very
technical type and it ruined his hook.

Blast from the past! I had a model of a space station circa late \'60s that
followed this design, sort of. The model was a rocket shaped tube with one 
side made of clear plastic so you could see the interior detail. Inside
were a series of tiny decks with control consoles, beds, and some other
sparse molded details, with ladders connecting the decks through 
deck/overhead hatches. There were a bunch of little guys in about 15mm scale
you could glue into the model.

The nose cone section of the station was just big enough to hold one
of the little guys, molded in boxers and undershirt, standing in front
of a sink with medicine cabinet, brushing his teeth. I don\'t remember
any toilet, just a sink.

The strange thing was that "down" on this model was towards the nose
cone. I was only about eight at the time, I don\'t remember if there was
any mention of spinning the station for gravity, or if there was any
gravity. All the engineering stuff was at the opposite end of the
nose cone, as you\'d expect in a `60s style rocket, just that the decks
were laid out upside down to what you\'d expect.

Or maybe I just put it together that way by mistake.

I don\'t think this is correct. Newer carnival rides employ designs
which vary the angular velocity and allow loops *without* pulling
as many gees at the bottom. Since they were introduced, loops have
become easier to build (and more popular).

There are certainly tricks to help people deal with more gees, though.
Pilots use special suits today, and gee tanks (with or without filling
your lungs with liquid :-) can be used. It also would help to be lying
down facing the direction of thrust (like most Earthforce fighters in
Babylon 5). Ships with reaction drives, at least, will be able to have
higher accelerations than 6G.

I suppose you could treat inertial compensators as an "all-or-nothing"
thing, so that you would go instantly from 1G "down" to >6G "back"
(which may or may not be the same as "down") if they are overstressed
or fail. This would explain why >6G ships are rare (the pilots would
have to be in gee tanks for non-trivial trips). It would also explain
why the decks often are not perpendicular to the direction of thrust
and would give you a "desperation maneuver" to try when needed. I\'m
not sure if it "feels right" for inertial compensators to work this
way, but it is one way to look at them.

see if anyone else uses them, what you think of them, etc.

I was reminded of the first one I\'ll discuss by a comment by Leonard 
Erikson that he likes to exploit players\' ignorance in his adventures.  
My method is the flip-side of that: use something I know in a way that 
imparts that knowledge to the players.  I\'ve talked about doing this 
before (my infamous radical ecologist adventures, for example).  Has 
anyone else used this method?

Another method I use is to take current events and twist them a bit to 
fit with the setting.  For instance, regarding the crash of TWA flight 
800, I might have something similar happen to a space ship, and have the 
players attempt to determine the cause (sabotage, attack, catostrophic 
failure).  Obviously, the adventure would differ greatly from the real 
fact it was based on, but the inspiration would come from the real event.

Does anyone else have a particular method of adventure creation that 
could be helpful to the rest of us who are often at loose ends when 
coming up with the umpteenth adventure scenario? :)

Hmmm...they\'re probably not too worried about traders.  While I never 
restricted the sale of jump drives in MY Imperium, I can see that a case 
could be made for keeping them out of potential insurgents\' hands and 
whatnot.

No, I don\'t.  I know, I said that a case could be made for keeping it 
restricted.  But, I didn\'t say a /good/ case could be made for that.  :)  
Besides, I don\'t like it...and won\'t run my game that way.

D\'ohh!  I was reading from the first (unrevised) version of FF&S, which 
doesn\'t have the clarifying, parenthetical comment.  Still, it doesn\'t 
kill my original point about how there\'s plenty of surface area to go 
around, even with 6G thrusters.  My roommate has the Mark I, Mod 1

I think that there is 1 very simple restriction that would keep high 
j-drives from being used in most applications: economics.  If you use 
the old 10% of hull fuel capacity for the drives, it just isn\'t 
economical to be cavorting around in a J-6 ship...unless of course 
you\'re a naval vessel, or something else that is run without regard 
to cost...

I don\'t and wouldn\'t use an arbitrary limit...I think that starship 
economics would make it hard for all but the most wealthy of PC 
groups...and let\'s face it, rich PC groups are not all that fun 
anyways...

We\'d need design rules for it, but it\'s a good idea.  C.J. Cherryh\'s
(_Downbelow Station_ and _Rimrunners_ come to mind) ship designs address the
issue by defining down differently in different parts of the ship at
different times.  When docked to the outside edge of a rotating station, for
example, down is away from the bow of the ship. When accelerating in space,
down is the same.  When not accelerating, the parts of the ship where most
of the crew are most of the time rotate to create centrifugal force, and the
rest of the ship doesn\'t have down.  Does this make any sense?  I\'d say
Cherryh explains it better, but she doesn\'t actually explain it; she just
brings you into it with the story.

        A French T4\'s success, I think, would depend upon its
"compatibility" with French SF.  I don\'t know how compatible Traveller would
be with a Lone Sloan/Vagabond des Limbes sort of SF tradition.  It\'s much
more Asimov/Niven in inspiration, so far as I can tell, and it would be a
tough fit with the "fantastique" vein of French SF that I\'m familiar with.

        Of course, I stopped following French SF (and to a large extent SF
in general; law school will do that to you) about 3-4 years ago, and I can\'t
claim to have exhaustively canvassed it either, so I could be totally out to
lunch on this.

        Interesting, isn\'t it, how rpgs seem to be poor cousins of literary
genres?  D&D fed off of Tolkein, Traveller off of SF in general, Vampire off
Anne Rice...  Are there any RPG\'s out there that didn\'t evolve out of some
form of geek literature :)?

I haven\'t been on the "newer" ones as it\'s been 15-20 years since I
rode *any* carnival ride. But on at least one of the rides I was on,
it was *rotating as a unit*. So we had to get 2 gee at the bottom just
to neutralize our weight at the top. To have any sort of safety factor,
it needs more like 2.5-3.5.

I think it makes far more sense to treat them as neutralizing up to
their max, but it doesn\'t matter if you are running at the max or above
it. So with 6g neutralizers, you could run at 9 gees and only be
subjected to 3 of them.

Well, there are those films of Col. Stapp (and others) in the rocket
sled tests of the 50\'s that show them enduring 40+ gees for seconds.
No injuries except some bruising.

And as I keep saying, I suspect anybody in decent shape can handle 3
gees for hours.

I\'m not sure where to dig up all the info from Stapp\'s research, but it
has all sorts of info. Things like volunteers handling dry air temps of
500 degrees F for rather substantial periods (half an hour or so).

Fighter pilot has to use the sidearm controllers (you *don\'t* use a
stick on something where the pilot is expected to use it during
*continuous* high acceleration.

I\'m also told that prolonged high acceleration has some problems you
wouldn\'t think of. Urination is easily dealt with by the usual tubing
setup. But lord help anyone who needs to defecate! In fact, you want
your digestive tract relatively empty of solids for high gee manuevers.

It\'s what comes of a lifetime of moderate paranoia coupled with an
inventive mind raused on things like Brunner\'s "Traveller in Black"
fantasy stories.... <evil leer>

If I had the current rules on stuff like sensors, it\'d be a fun setup
to draw up plans and flesh things out. Then submit it to JTAS. 

My very first dungeon plan (back in 75!) had a lever on the wall of one
room. It controlled a trapdoor *outside* the room. Took the players
forever to figure it out...

* <-trapdoor

The room was an old guardroom for the dungeon cells on the side
corridor. The trapdoor was an extra hazard for anybody who managed to
get out of a cell.

In any case, keep two things in mind. First, a real and reasonable
purpose for building the whatever. Second, what it will *look like*
from the viewpoint of a player. The trick is thinking of things where a
player\'s "distorted" view of the universe will lead them down the
garden path.

Oh yes, there\'s a *third* level to the "waste dump" scenario if you are
*truly* evil. Much "waste" for one industry is a "valuable raw
material" for another. Especially if the second industry is at a higher
tech level.

So if your players barely make it out alive, and decide to blast the
hell out of the place (say by detonating a nuke), both out of
frustration and to "make the place safe", picture their reactions when
they get back to civilization and (eventually) find out that they
"wastes" were actually worth *money* to some megacorp!

If they don\'t blow it up, you can have them read the news later about
how XYZ corp is making a fortune reprocessing the wastes. :-)

They may just shoot themselves rather than keep playing...

There are several problems with this. First of all, if the pilot is in
a low berth you might as well not have him there.

Also, it takes *time* to prep for low berth and revive you from it. And
it has the problem that there is a non-trivial chance of *dying& every
time you are "revived".

Then there\'s the matter of just *how* low berths work. It\'s rather
likely that there\'s a treshold above which you start taking rather
*drastic* damage.

Ah! The old Revell MOL (Manned Orbiting Laboratory) model. Complete
with a couple of wedge shaped "DynaSoar" lifting bodies to use as
shuttles. 

It was an actual Air Force design that was one of the *many* things we
lost when NASA\'s space program became *the* Space Program.

In the late 60\'s a lot of the old 50s space kits got re-released. I
wish I had some of them now. Especially the ones that Lindberg
released. They re-released some kits as a "Mars Probe" series. But I
recognized them. They were originally models of the old Von Braun lunar
program designs. A two stage "parabolic" shape booster with a
cylindrical third stage and sattellite,. The same booster with a winged
re-entry vehicle. A "standard" spinning wheel space station. And an
open framework lunar lander (Earth Orbit Rendevous design).

Hmmm. If I can afford the new rules, it might be fun to reverse
engineer a lot of the old designs from the 50s. They were *workable,
it\'s just that (in most cases) we had better engines or materials by
the time we wanted to build things. Just what you need for a TL 7
civilization reaching out into space. :-)

Ah"," you obviously misunderstand the true nature of the Party. A simple and
understandable mistake for those subjected to years of virilant Imperial
propoganda.

The Party doesn\'t need to recruit the unwilling"," true honest upstanding

Contary to the vile Imperial propoganda put about before the inevitable
liberation of the peoples of the decadent Imperium"," The Party is not
dominated by bigots dedicated to some outdated notion of racial purity.
The Party simply seeks what\'s best for all sophonts. It is clearly evident that

Sure!  One of the one\'s that got a lot of comment from my players is the
scenario where they were doing recon through a forested"," mountainous

I\'ve done this too"," but it\'s not always sucessful.  Another method"," which is
more sucessful for me"," is to draw inspiration from strange or unusual events
in the news - but not worry about keeping it accurate to \'the real thing\'. 

As an example"," a few years ago around here"," a husband and wife (who were
wealthy lawyers) were found shot to death in their own bed.  It was not a
suicide (the weapon wasn\'t in the room)"," nor was it a robbery (valuables","including jewelry"," were still in the room).  Just taking that little snippet","and building an adventure around it (in this case"," of course"," a murder mystery

There was a series of articles last year in _Fantasy & Science Fiction_
magazine about how to identify radioactive waste storage sites as
dangerous over thousands of years. The articles touched on all kinds of
issues that have been discussed on the list in the past. Massive population
reductions"," radical language shifts"," catastrophes causing loss of records","inability to read records that survived"," all kinds of stuff.

One of the identification methods discussed was covering the site with
extremely durable stone works"," sculpted to be discordant and disturbing.
Throw in some glyphs showing people digging around in the site"," then
falling dead would help get the point across that this was somewhere you
didn\'t want to be"," and that you really didn\'t want to screw around with it.
The idea is most human monuments are designed to be emotionally compelling

a site that makes people discovering it uneasy just being there would send
a different message. Of course"," it\'s possible the message might be 
interpreted as The people who built this place were some sick puppies,
let\'s start digging and see what they\'re trying to hide.

Coupled with this was an effort to create some kind of unambiguous glyphic
language that could present the message Danger! Keep Out! across ten
thousands years. This had all kinds of problems. How do you get across the
idea of radiation to people who may have lost the concept of radioactivity","using simple cartoons?

Lot of interesting stuff there for a Traveller adventure or two. Even three
thousand years in the future"," the danger in these sites still has another
seven thousand years to go.

As a _rough_ guess"," I\'d say that about 40 percent of your engineering

pretty minumum prize crew.  Assuming that the norm is for a three
section watch rotation plus extra for training purposes (pretty standard

third.  Of course"," these numbers could easily be affected by automation","depending on computer capabilities and skills and the amount of battle

Oh come now.  Roleplaying a multiple personality has to be the ultimate in
fun!  One possibility that immediately comes to mind is having *two*
players playing the same character.  When a certain set of circumstances
or a traumatic event occurs"," they switch.

Of course"," short of having a clinical psychologist as a player (which I do
have"," actually) the character will be played according to the players
perception of MP disorder"," not a real knowledge.  But hey! its a game!

Now I *have* had players playing paranoid characters before"," but only
after finding out that the universe and God were out to get them :)

But back to the self-probing.  Does a probe reveal more than the surface
thoughts or knowlege of the target?  Will a probe from a psionic delve
into the target\'s subconcious mind normally?  If not"," I can\'t see how it
would do so when the target \'happens\' to be the psionic.  If so"," I can see
a new set of career opportunities for psi telepaths...Psi-psychoanalysts. 

I do like your (obviously knowlegable) perspective on MPs mindprobing
themselves.  The only other situation I can think of which might be
different is if the person doing the self-probe is possessed in some
way"," or at times"," either by an alien race or by some form of MP disorder
(My understanding is that we know so little of the actual nature of this
disorder that there could be different \'causes\' for what we consider one
affliction).  It is possible that they would discover this possession when
conducting a mind probe.

Mindprobing Aliens: Humans think in images and in languages.  To some
extent our symbol of a thing is the word we use to refer to it and the
mental picture of it.  When I think of \'bird\' I think at the same time of
the four letter word \'bird\' and of a small winged creature as a visual
image"," generally a Robin.  This follows a certain theory of symbol
formation whose name I forget"," but which says we use ideal examples of
things when thinking about them.

Therefore if I were to mindprobe a person who did not speak english I
would be presented with a partially understandable series of symbols and
images which I could take some meaning from.  If I were to mindprobe a
human with a truly different set of basic assumptions (say"," an Arabian
desert nomad) as humans we would have onlyy a few common anchors to
interpret his thoughts.  The very structure of his language is different","so I would not know whether I was looking at a \'verb\' symbol"," a \'noun\'
symmbol"," or something entirely different.

Aliens? even worse.

Aslan and Vargr might be OK.  Their symbols would have more olfactory
images associated with them in both cases"," and the completely different
language would be one barrier"," but I would think that they pretty much
think in the same basic set of sensory inputs that we do.  

Hivers would be Right Out.  As would just about any \'alien\' alien.  trying
to sense what one is thinking would be a stressful and confusing session.

Anyone have any other thoughts that I could read on the subject?

History:
The Fuer Class was built by Panstellar Enterprises"," a Solomani corporation
specializing in high technology. (See Book 8 Robots) Originally they
built ships on Terra"," but during the Solomani Rim War"," the evacuated to 
Alpha Crucis Sector.  The Fuer class is a dedicated cargo hauler"," it
has no capacity for passenger carrying.  The ship has never won
any awards for beauty"," but it is solidly built and of very high quality.
The ship is box shaped with two stubby wings"," mounted to the top
of the fuselage.  Crew quarters are on the top deck"," along with the
power plant. The bottom decks are used for engineering and cargo. The ship has
clam shell doors in the front and in the rear.  When both are open
its possible to drive through the ship.  

In the New Era"," some of these ships survive.  In the RC"," Transstar\'s 
flag ship"," the Pride of Terra"," is a relic Fuer Class.  Others of this
class can be found throughout Solomani Rim"," and the spinward edge of Alpha
Crucis.  Transstar has had to modify the Pride to lessen the chance
of Virus contamination.  Mainly they have downgraded the automation","and
increased the number of crew.  To make rooms for the extra crew members
Transstar has built several new staterooms in the cargo hold. They are built
along the side of the hold"," to still allow cargo handlers to drive through.  
The rooms aren\'t sound proofed"," so its very noisy during cargo loading and
unloading. Junior crew members are usually assigned to these rooms.  


Values in parentheses are for Low Automation model"," circa 1201.

        This would be a great idea for a campaign which has two players, who
can\'t always both make it ... have them share one character, and whoever\'s
there that night plays it his (her) way!

        In my gut-level opinion, you should be able to run ANY size ship for
a jump or two with only one person on board. This assumes you don\'t do any
maintenance, repairs, combat or fancy maneuvers, and that it wasn\'t built in
a Virus era. But with linked computers, you should be able to slave
everything to one console. It\'ll require a lot of attention, and it better
be somebody who doesn\'t get confused with lots & lots of input (sensors,
comm, mdrive status, power plant status, astrogation, jump plotting, etc.,
etc. ... know what you can temporarily ignore, and what HAS to be handled).

        But for any kind of efficiency, reliability, or ANYTHING more than
"jump from point A to point B," you\'ll need more.

        Leonard, you just gave me an idea for a seriously kickbutt campaign.
It\'d involve recycling Traveller\'s rule system into a homebrew setting; as
you put it, a TL-7 society reaching out into space... namely, that of earth
circa 1955-1975 or so!

        I figure on an alternate history based on the Niven story where
William Proxmire has a time machine built so he can go back, inject Lt. R.A.
Heinlein with an antibiotic so he isn\'t health-discharged out of the U.S.
Navy, and doesn\'t go on to write SF that\'ll in part inspire the U.S. space
program.  Proxmire returns from his time trip to find that Admiral Heinlein
actually managed to get the U.S. space program much farther along much
earlier..:) 

        Regardless of method, for whatever reason (maybe the Nazi long-range
V-weapons were a raving success and New York got blitzed, thereby scaring a
lot of people) both the East and West have put a lot more money into space a
lot earlier, perhaps with space stations by 1950, and the Moon by 1955.  In
this world Korea never happened, and neither did the Indochinese/Vietnamese
conflict; all the energy is going into space.

        So: it\'s 1965 or so... the Cold War is in full swing; President
Eisenhower has just been reelected for his sixth term <g>, and the U.S. and
Russia are both racing to explore the inner solar system with craft based on
the 1950\'s hypothetical designs that Leonard mentioned.  The Army, the Navy,
the Air Force, a (very different) NASA, and the Marines all have their own
space programs, a Cold War inter-service political development mirrored on
the other side of the Iron Curtain.  The British, French, and Chinese, not
to be outdone, likewise have their own space programs.  Ties and lapels are
narrow, men still wear brush cuts under their fedoras, and have barbeques
for their families out in the suburbs Sunday afternoons after church.  Cars
still have fins, and juvenile delinquency is still a problem.  Technicians
out in Area 51 are busily reverse engineering a flying saucer and
"debriefing" its crew.  Ian Fleming is churning out James Bond novels and
Northrop flying wings patrol the skies of America.  Senator McCarthy and the
House UnAmerican Activities Committee are still terrorizing Washington, and
Charlton Heston is still huge, although John Wayne is moving towards
megastardom.  For a more sinister note, the civil rights movement never
happened, the South is still segregated, and the Klan is strong.

        It\'d require a ref who was very good at creating atmosphere and
transmitting the flavour of the era.  If I were doing it I\'d try and feed
the players a few 1950\'s science fiction films and Cold War propaganda
films, make _X-planes of Edwards Air Force Base_ compulsory reading, and put
together a little background package with some visualisation aids (photos of
cars, clothes, buildings, aircraft, nuclear tests, etc), the alternate
history timeline, and details on service backgrounds.

        I think that this would be really, really fun.  I\'m almost tempted
to give it a shot.

        Interesting; I\'m just wondering whether the actuals systems for
determining hypothetical event outcomes via dice are copyrighted?  I\'d
assume so, but I could be wrong...

        This is not neccessarily a bad thing; if you\'ve got a good system,
why not tack whatever setting you want onto it?  Take more creativity on the

A few days ago, I posted a request for help for a computer problem I\'ve been
having.  My 486-38MHz processor was running at 7Mhz (found out when programs
started running slower and I ran a sysinfo program).  Anyway, I got some
replies and tried everything I could that was suggested, and no help.  Let
me summarize what I tried.

Suggestion 1 - VIRUS SCAN

Scanned for Virus and found nonw on either the HD\'s or memory.  Used CPAV.


Suggestion 2 - Check connections for the TURBO SWITCH

When in the sysinfo program, if I hit the turbo switch, I drop from 7MHz to
3.5MHz.  I assume this means my turbo switch is connected and running properly.


Suggestion 3 - Check CMOS Settings for the TURBO SWITCH

I checked to make sure I was booting into high speed and I am, and also see
Suggestion 2.



Well, That\'s it.  Anyone else have any suggestions aside from buying a new
computer?  I\'d even settle for telling me that I did something wrong on one
of the above suggestions (only if I did, of course).

Thanks for the help everyone, and I\'m sorry for the waste of bandwidth.  To
everyone who might be waiting for me to post (either here on in the games),
I\'m hoping that my office at work will get set up tomorrow, and then I\'ll be
able to post from there.  Downloading from here takes enough time, I don\'t
want to do too much posting as we live with my parents and they only have
one phone line.

Been working on a new version of Galactic. Sorry for taking so
long to get back to you. I wanted to have something positive to
report before opening my mouth.

The only thing I ever wrote for deckplans was Worldmap (available
at http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~jimv/ in the programs section), and I
can\'t really recommend it for that purpose. Starship deckplans
were more or less thrown in as an afterthought (after world
terrain, city terrain, castle terrain, and even dungeon terrain).
However, I have noticed some fairly decent deckplans in GIF
format on Joe Heck\'s Traveller Homepage (in the Missouri Archive
section if I remember correctly). Does anyone know what software
was used for that stuff?

You can actually see an entire sector at a time (hit the "?" key
at the sector screen where it shows the names of each of the
individual subsectors, and it should throw you a few hints). As
for the extended system, I was never really all that much into
it. Too many numbers, and most of my players don\'t care exactly
how long the day or year is on a given world, or even what the
precise gravity it, so long as they aren\'t stepping onto a black
hole. But maybe it\'s worth looking into. I\'ll give it some
thought.

With this current upgrade, I\'ve been concentrating mainly on bug
fixes and various subtle improvements while at the same time
adding as many world descriptions as I could easily find. Here\'s
a list of most of the new stuff in case you\'re really interested.

   * Aside from Red/Amber Zones, Blue zones are now possible.
   * Govt definitions separated into a user-modifiable data file.
   * Population code interpretation routine fixed.
   * Several sector construction menus redesigned for easier use.
   * Option added for generating completely unsettled sectors.
   * Configuration options incorporated directly into main menu.
   * Jump route table separated into user-modifiable data file.
   * Added world write-ups from the RICE archives.
   * Added Gushemege Sector from David Burden\'s HIWG archive.
   * Added a one-sector TNE galaxy put together by Lewis Roberts.
   * Now writing a history for the Variant-1 Galaxy.

The new version should hopefully be ready in about a week or two.
One of the things I\'m currently waiting on is a list of jump
routes for the Gushemege sector. David Burden has promised me a
copy, but whether or not he can actually retrieve/revive the
data, I have no idea. There\'s also a few more things I\'d like to
add, especially more world descriptions. The RICE archives are
great, but while they go in depth on the worlds they cover, they
don\'t cover a whole lot of worlds. If anyone has any world write-
ups they\'d like me to include, even if they\'re only one or two
paragraphs each, please email me whatever you\'ve got, and be sure
to include an Imperial date on it so I can say "circa such and
such a year."

The only other big question I\'ve received was from one satisfied
user who wondered why I wasn\'t selling the program. He felt that
it would get wider distribution off the shelf than on the
Internet. Personally, I would be all too happy to see somebody
like IG stuff the program into some atlas booklet (granted, it\'s
not quite good enough yet, but one can always dream). My only
stipulation would be that it remain Public Domain and that the
code be right there so that anyone can tweak it to their liking.
Of course, the authors of the various world write-ups would have
to consent to this also, but I can\'t imagine anybody saying no so
long as IG or whomever remains respectful of the TML and
fanzines.

After the whole incident w/ TSR, I\'ve become very leery of RPG
publishers in general, however, IG (so far) seems to be of a
different breed. My goal in this project is to encourage
individual gamers to create, detail, and share their own campaign
settings rather than subsist solely on professional (i.e. for-
profit) material. Hopefully that goal doesn\'t conflict with IG\'s
goal of putting Traveller back at the forefront of the SF-RPG
genre.

Fighter are flyable with "ship\'s boat" skill.
I think the limit in TCS was a scenario balancing limitation.

And, you can always make them remote control vessels, but then they would
have to stay within the comm range to the mothership.

I understand that this advertising jingle repeated itself with one second
pauses:
"Don\'t be stupid, be a smarty, join the Solomani Party!"  "Don\'t be stupid,
be a smarty, join the Solomani Party!"  "Don\'t be stupid, be a smarty, join
the Solomani Party!"  "Don\'t be stupid, be a smarty, join the Solomani Party!"

It was also used in certain Solomani guerrilla munitions, when the
guerrillas ran out of countdown recordings ("I\'m a thirty second bomb!  I\'m
a twenty-five second bomb!  I\'m a twenty second bomb!" etc.).

Remember why the good lord made your eyes, so don\'t shade your eyes, but
plagiarize ... only be sure always to call it please research.

Add The New York Times, Covert Action, The Nation, Soldier of Fortune, World
Press Review, and, when I\'m in a really black mood, the Wall Street Journal.  

Memoirs of private people involved in events similar to those in your
campaign are also really good.  Gennady Gerasimov\'s memoir of the Afghan War
(I\'ve forgotten the title) is great, and I read an ex-CIA agent\'s book about
his experiences in Saigon in 1974-75 (I\'ve forgotten both title and author
now -- I must be getting old) (I\'ll probably reread it in a year and, about
half-way through, say to myself, maybe I\'ve read this before).  The level of
human detail in these books and some others like them is wonderful, and has
inspired many of my NPCs and scenarios.

Please do.  Sometimes extended system stuff is important.  Sometimes it
isn\'t. It would be good to be able to generate it when needed.

More realistic would be stations by the mid 50\'s and the Moon by 60. As for
Korea...unless you have the entire peninsula under communist control, I
suspect it *would* happen.  Indochina had been having revolts before WWII,
and after the war they were *bound* to rebel, the only way *not* to have that
conflict would be if the French did the smart thing and gracefully bowed out.

Are you Canadian?  <G> It would have been Ike\'s 4th or 5th, at best.
Roosevelt\'s last term went up to \'48, and if Ike was elected then instead of
Truman then he could have been re-elected in 52, 56, 60, & 64 and he\'d be in
his 5th term.  But Ike wasn\'t back from Europe and retired in time for the 48
race, so it would likely be that he didn\'t run until 52.

Actually, McCarthy was a short lived phenominon.  We\'d have lost interest,
and he\'d have lost power pretty quickly, especially if we\'d started looking
upward and outward.

Nope.  The Klan wasn\'t powerful in the American South since the
early 1920\'s.  It existed on the fringes, behind closed doors, and was a
continuing embarassment to most folks down here.  The crackers in the Klan
were what folks up north thought everybody was like down South, not true. 
Shoot, the rest of the country actually thought Gomer Pile and the Beverly
Hillbillies were realistic images of Southerners too.  <g>

The Civil Rights Movement was going to happen, and with Ike in
office it was going to succeed.  He and the Republicans were really more
likely to have pushed things through than the Democrates.  It would have
taken a different form and had a different pace, but it was going to happen. 
OTOH, the South of the middle 60\'s was still *very* segregated in the real
world...so was the North, the Midwest, and the West.

        A couple of years ago I rain into a good selection of Traveller
        material in a second-hand bookstore in Stuttgart. I found 6 old
        Black Books and 4 Alien Modules in english, and two German books
        that I have not seen in english.

        The German books were "Gene Wars Chronicles" -sourcebook and
        "Deep-Sleeper" -adventure.

        In addition to the German version, I have seen some Traveller
        material in Swedish and Finnish.

Make it DRAPOCCH (Dropping Rocks At Point-One C Can Hurt). I won\'t
even begin to discuss how to pronounce it. :-) :-) :-)

Or for some real suggestions, how about something like "Imperium

with "Times" (e.g., "Far Future Times").

LOVE the ideas. Here\'s another: Elvis doesn\'t join the Army - he joins the
Planetary Exploration Force. Beach movies are now set on the sands of Mars.
Beat Poetry is performed on lunar cappuccino cafes... <g>

By the way...I\'d seriously start tightening this and send it in as a
proposal for SOME company. It\'s great and I\'d hate to see someone else beat
you to the punch.

Hey! Someone used one of my designs! I\'m flattered. :-) 
It\'s in the archives somewhere, but for additional flavor, I 
might note that the Highlander-class is a commercial conversion 
of surplus "Lewis & Clark"-class Imperial Scout Service surveyors,  
which was a predecessor of the well-known "Donosev"-class ISS surveyor. 
(The "Lewis & Clark" is also in the archives, another one of our 
designs).

I\'m a mac person - and drew them myself. Originally, I used MacDraw to
lay out those plans, but recently (year or so) I got ahold of a copy of
Adobe Illustrator and I know do deckplans in those.

  Double that grin. :-)  Having talked to family members on both sides of
that project (Aircraft design & production/military nuclear design &
production), it was painfully obvious that dog just wasn\'t gonna hunt.

Get a copy of GURPS Atomic Horror. It\'s great at describing the \'50s
atmosphere, it has lots of background information that would be nice
to have on hand. As far as directly applicable information for space
adventures, it\'s on the B-movie level of V-2 style rockets and flying
saucers.

This would be a great adventure--I\'m remembering a _Popular Science_ 
article from the \'60s detailing the old DynaSoar lifting body proposal.
There was a painting of a U.S. Air Force DynaSoar fitted with .50 cal
machine guns shooting a Commie spysat into junk. Coool!

You know, this is the world Kip from Robert Heinlein\'s "Have Spacesuit,
Will Travel" must live in.

to be able to design space stations, starports, and orbital habitats.
This shouldn\'t be too far from spaceships/starships, and FF&S2 could
accomadate me with the following additions;

[my own ideas appear in these brackets and have been added after the
fact]

Stationkeeping thrusters; less than 1G, distributed thrusters for
maintaining an orbital location.

[this is pretty simple...use manuver drives at 1/2 of 1G for all factors] 

Starport/Habitat configurations and USP; a simple way to describe how
populous and advanced a starport or orbital hab is would be nice.  At
least a few more components for designing such things is needed.

Structural Supports;  If I want to use centrifugal(sp) force to maintain
gravity on a ship or station, shouldn\'t I need a bit of structural
reinforcement to prevent damage due to differential stress?  How do I dock
- - through the middle?  Can Spaceships rotate like that? or do I need a
stationary inner hub (shades of Babylon 5 or Rama here)?

[This can be more complicated.  Stressing for variable stress out to 1G
should be more difficult than simply stressing a starship hull for 1G of
acceleration.  Perhaps simply doubling the volume and weight penalty; i.e.
if max G at the outermost point is 1G, the whole structure needs to be
stressed for 2G] 

Extended Environmental support;  what does it take for a truly closed
self-supporting artificial eco-system.  Theory is that you can make
everything you need if you have the right components; plant life, sunlight
energy, waste recycling technology, perfect water reclamation.  But how
much space do you need? What if you have regular water shipments or
rations?  Can my ficus tree scrub the CO2 from my apt? 

[We\'ve come up with several neat ideas; immense plankton tanks 2cm thick,
plant life which grows like curtains of lichen, big open spaces
with small bodies of water and lush growth.  We wanted to avoid
having some "black box" waste recycler which takes all the human waste and
turns it into steak and broccoli.  the hard part for me was deciding how
big a volume of CO2 and waste eating plant or animal life is needed for
the population supported] 

Human space; Accomadations should go up to apartments and permanent
dwellings.  Humans require a certain amount of space if they are expected
to live there for an extended period (like, all their life!), how much
space is that?  What do food prep areas take up - minimal, adequate, roomy
and spacious kitchens should be on the list! (and I want a nice little
skylight right over the island here...and a BIG refrigerator over
there...and exposed wood beams here and here..and..ooh Track Lighting!).
How much space do humans need for "open areas" (like full of plants and
such)?  

[Should not require too much effort.  My kitchen is about 100 cu. m. and
spacious (but has no exposed wood beams or track lights)]

Ship Dock; What kind of space can we expect to see on a station or
starport devoted to docking space?  remember cargo has to be stored,
loaded, unloaded and stored again while in close proximity to where the
ship is located.  ships should be able to dock (clamps and access ports)
or enter a bay (full volume of the ship, plus) and in both cases be able
to move cargo freely.  What about repair docks? 

[bays are just like subordinate craft bays on starships, cargo handling
space should at least equal the size of the bay (with warehouse space,
cargo handling equipment (walkers!), Environmental system recharger[what
does that look like?], etc.)]  

Ship construction equipment;  how much volume does a starship construction
yard take up (answer: as much as it wants to?).  How large a vessel can it
build?  How much asteroid ore needs to be processed to provide the hull
materials?  How many drives can a factory put out of a certain size?  What
materials do they need?  This is getting a bit furhter than I intended,
but it is also important (perhaps it should wait ona JOTAS article, but
get some consideration in this process).

[My own take; SS construction yards are zero-gravity areas of a starport
with massive amounts of space open to vacuum and a large enclosed &
pressurized work area where components are put together prior to final
assembly "outside".  Some yards for small (under 1000 tons) ships are
entirely pressurized, but without gravity.  A yard is four times the
volume of the ship being constructed (no flames! this is just a guess!)]

Ok, enough for now.  I\'m sure I\'m gonna see some opinions on this one.

     I would love to see more about space stations in T4.
     As well as the design sequences for them, I\'d like to know more 
     general stuff.
     Do most worlds have them?  Are they big enough to service huge 
     freighters that never have to land at a starport?  Do they ever become 
     powerful enough in their own rights (a la Downbelow Station - can\'t 
     you tell I\'ve been re-reading my Cherryh ;-))?
     
     There was a very interesting adventure in an old White Dwarf where the 
     players were hired to break into the "elevator" that rode from the 
     ground, up a huge, long cable to a space station which was anchored by 
     an asteroid at the end of the cable.

Actually, we should just go ahead and make it clear that you can install
maneuver drives at any fraction of a G that you want.  A station can
probably get by with thrusters that\'re worth 0.1G or so.  Alien worlds will
probably build maneuver drives in multiples of their own local gravity (so
that, Terrans build 1G, 2G, and so on, while whatchamacallems build 0.9G,
1.8G, 2.7G and so on).

> Starport/Habitat configurations and USP

Before even addressing that, we should make _sure_ to include the
appropriate formulae for building hulls significantly larger than 1,000,000
tons standard displacement.  A decent-sized station can be much larger than
that (and besides, there\'s that huge starship from the old Sky Raiders
trilogy).

No more so than a ship under the same amount of stress.  If you\'re spinning
the habitat so that it\'s at 1G at the edges, the structure is under 2G of
stress, and should be designed accordingly.  This is a simple rule to add
into FF&S.

Also, at higher TLs, the simple answer is to use gravitics to provide
gravity in the parts of the station where you need it, and not in other
parts.  Such a station would probably look like a long slab, or irregular
structure, with docking bays along the edges of the slab.

> How do I dock - through the middle?

You can do that.  You could also use Cherryh\'s method of docking to the
edges (that\'s _much_ trickier, though, to get it right).  Another option
would be to have a de-spun dock section in the hub (so that the dock is not
spinning at all) and equipment to transfer cargo containers from the hub to
the spinnign part of the station.

> Can Spaceships rotate like that?

Sure.  It\'d probably take a computer to do it accurately, though.

That works too.

I don\'t know, and I don\'t know that anyone has the answers - the only
long-term practical experiment in a self-supporting closed eco-system was a
not what I\'d call a shining success.

> Ship Dock; What kind of space can we expect to see on a station or
> starport devoted to docking space?

Cargo is much easier to handle in zero-G.  Particularly if there were a
non-spinning section, it would be large enough to handle the cargo
transfers.  Cargo destined for trans-shipment would be unloaded, stored, and
re-loaded all without leaving the zero-G section of the dock.

Repair and construction of small ships are probably done in
entirely-enclosed bays.  The bays would be in the zero-G section of the
port, but once the ship is in, the doors would be closed and the bay
pressurized (I\'d guess that this would be practical for ships up to about
1000 tons).

Larger ships would be "parked" in zero-G shipyards outside the station:
there would probably be orbital zones reserved for those businesses nearby.
The shipyard would have some pressurized modules (for permanent offices,
storage, and similar areas - workers would probably "commute" from the space
station nearby) and a lot of equipment (work pods, thruster packs and so
on).  Depending on the work required, the work would be done from in a
pressure suit or work pod, or (for some repairs) a temporary "pressure
shelter" could be attached to the side of the ship, pressurized, and work
could progress from within the shelter.  Modules could be fabricated in
pressurized work bays, then picked up by a pod and brought to the ship where
they are installed by workers in vacc suits.

A while back I posted Trannstar, the Solomani Megacorp that survived
into the RC. I came up with a list of Transstar\'s ships and figured I
post them to the TML.  The ships make use of the Oasis fuel depots that
Franklin Cain posted about a while back. The numbers in the routes are
the hex numbers where fuel depots are located.

The Paschendales, Sundowners, Feuer, Arafur, J-3 Merchant ships were
all relic ships that Transstar kept on Fija. The rest were purchased in
the New Era.  The Big Red, Jelly\'s Delight and the Sea Sprite were all
purchased from Free Traders, and the crew now works for Transstar.

I tried to give some of the ships foreign names, because the Solomani
spoke several different languages. I picked words out of foreign
language dictionaries. If I have screwed up any of these, let me know. 
der Krieger means Warrior in German.
Zauberer means Wizard in German.
Skakac is the Serbo-Croatian name for the Knight Chess Piece.
Diablotin Angelique is French for Angelic Imp.
Estrella Rojo is Spainish for Red Star
 
I use several ships that came from the TML:
Paschendale from a TML design by Micheal Bailey
J3 Trader from a TML design by ???
Arafura Yacht from a TML design by Micheal Bailey
Highlander from a MT TML design by Cynthia C. Higginbotham
Feuer I posted yesterday.
I\'ll post the Sundowner in a minute.

- ----

Pre-Collapse:The Sundowner Free Trader was a common sight in the Solomani
Confederation, it was the standard tramp freighter, it hauled freight on 
the fringes, and to worlds far off the beaten path.  It carried freight
and passengers between the various member states, and between individual 
worlds.  It was produced under license by many different producers.  
The actual design was owned by the Confederation.

New Era: Four of these craft are known to exist in RC space, all  four are
owned by Transstar, the Hokka, der Krieger, the Zauberer, and the Skakac.
Transstar was able to store these ships through the collapse, and once 
contact was made with the Hivers, they were able to buy new parts, and start
flying them again.  To prevent Virus from taking over, the controls were 
redone, and an additional engineer is stationed aboard. To make room for 
the extra workstation, Transstar turned the engineer\'s fresher and storage
closet into workspace.  The new workspace isn\'t very pretty, and the junior
engineer on board is assigned to the "Head station."

Solomani Space:  Ships of this class were found throughout Confederation 
space, and many are sure to survive in places like the Near Bootes 
Confederation, the Terran Republic, and the League of Dingir.


The Sundowner appeared in Alien Module 6: Solomani, and in Solomani
and Aslan. I used the MegaTraveller stats in Solomani and Aslan in
this design.

Actually, I\'d build it as a flying boat and land it off shore
somewhere...for flavor more than anything else.  <G> 

The reasons the real prototype was judged impractical was that it was judged
too soon.  The concept that was looked at, and rejected, was based on power
plant designs that nobody had had a chance to
optimize for flight..heck..this was before the Navy worked out how to use
fission reactors in submarines.  <g> The second thing was size, to be
practical the vehicle would have had to be huge, and I doubt anybody in the
early 50\'s really antcipated the true market for airtransport.

Not quite true. It\'s not *ignorance* I exploit. That wouldn\'t be fair. 
Instead I apply an *old* saying:

"It ain\'t what you don\'t know that hurts you,
 It\'s what you know that ain\'t so."

In other words, it\'s when you *assume* that you know something, but
really don\'t, *then* you get in trouble.

ARRRGGGGHHHHH!

Someone, *please* tell me me the above isn\'t what the rules *really* say?

You *cannot* get a reasonable figure for surface area by *multiplying*
volume by a *fixed* number!

Consider a cube 1 meter on a side. The volume is one m^3, but the
surface area is 6 m^2. The surface area is 6 times the volume.

Now consider a cube *two* meters on a side. The volume is 2^3. That\'s 8
m^3. The surface is 6x2^2. That\'s 24 m^2. The surface area is 3 times
the volume. 

Now consider a cube that is 3 meters on a side. volume is 27 m^3, area
is 54 m^2. For a ratio or 2:1.

4 meters= 64 m^3 volume, 96 m^2 area. 1.5 to 1.
5 meters= 125 m^3, 150 m^2 area. 
100 m = 1e6 m^3 vol, 6e4 area, for a ratio of .06 to 1

General formulas for cube:
volume = l^3
  area = 6*l^2
surface/volume = 6/l

Get the picture? It works out similarly for other shapes.

Surface area of a sphere is 4pi r^2. volume is 4/3 pi r^3. So surface
to volume is 3/r.

Note that the surface to volume ratio of *any* shape is a constant
(determined by the shape) times the *size* (ie linear dimensions) of
the object. This also means that the ratio depends on the *units* used
to measure it. (this is because the ratio is ignoring the fact that you
are dividing area by volume, which isn\'t a legal operation
dimensionally)

So it looks like the surface area rules are *badly* broken. The
*proper* way to determine surface area is to have a "shape constant"
for the different hull shapes, and multiply it times the length
*squared*. Volume would use a *different* shape constant multiplied by
the length cubed.

Note that shape includes things like the ratios between things. For
example, the "constant" for a cone depends on the ratio of the height
to the width. Ditto for cylinders and the like. 

So it\'s probably a case of either using the "messy" formulas that take
into account the proportions of the shape, or else we\'ll have to
specify the proprotions of the various hull shapes.

BTW, this *could* be a reason for "inefficient" shapes like the
"saucer" section of the Enterprise. You build that way if you *want*
more surface area (either for cooling, or for mounting things on).

You know *why* it was in F&SF, rather than, say, Analog? Because the
folks at Analog know that high level waste isn\'t dangerous over
multi-thousand year time periods.

Radiation output is *inversely* proportional to half-life. Anything
that puts out lot of radiation has a *short* half-life. The usual
figure is that after 300 years typical high level waste is no more
radioactive than a good deposit of uranium ore.

You wouldn\'t want to set up housekeeping there, but you can wander
through without any serious radiation hazard.

All the stuff with *long* halflives is hardly radioactive enough to
worry about. Plutonium is radioactive, but I could pick up a piece of
it, look it over, hand it to you, let you look it over, and then put it
back on the table and we could both walk off. No real problem unless we
got some into our bodies somehow. The radiation dose would be well
within safety limits.

A lot of these things are *toxic*, which is a different matter. Arsenic
is 30 times more toxic than plutonium. 

So if you store the waste in a form that is biologically inert, and
fairly strong, then while it\'d be *nice* to have it marked for
millenia, it\'s really not that important after the furst few hundred
years.

And if I describe a site like that to most players, they\'ll
*immediately* figure that I\'m running a crossover campaign (Traveller
and Call of Cthulhu!)

I thought about that myself. I marked some containers with a pair of
red triangles placed point to point. About half the folks I asked
figured it out. (Hint, ever see a black widow spider?)

BTW, it\'s rather more likely than not that we\'d be digging up nuclear
waste dumps *on purpose* and cursing the idiots that made it so hard to
extract the elements we want from them. There are a *lot* of uses for
the stuff in those wastes.

The same goes for a lot of "toxic waste". It\'s actually possible to
recycle them into other industrial processes. One of the more glaring
examples is that some of tye "poison gas" that the Army has stored
could be *sold* for a profit to the chemical industry. You see, some of
the components of "binary" gases are either useful industrial
chemicals, or something easily converted into such.

They can\'t dispose of them that way though because the public screams
about the idea of transporting "poison gas" thru their communities. Of
course it never occurs to them that there is one hell of a lot *more*
material that is *far* more toxic being shipped through every day. Lots
of industrial chemicals are as toxic as war gases, if not *more* toxic.

Yes, *more* toxic. The more toxic ones aren\'t useful as weapons for one
reason or another. Possibly because they aren\'t stable enough, or are
too much trouble to handle. Nitroglycerin is more explosive than
demolition charges too, but it\'s too much trouble to handle. Same idea.

Which brings up the fun of players accepting a shipment of industrial
chemicals, or some such, without reading the fine print....

Well, there was a person on one of the Compuserve Forums I used to
frequent who *was* an MPD (due to the nature of the forum, it is rather
unlikely that they were lying about it)

They had been diagnosed a while back and were undergoing therapy aimed
at integrating the sub-personalities into a whole, but it had a long
ways to go. But since most of them knew what was going on, they had a
"truce" of sorts.

It made for rather interesting message traffic. Especially if there was
a disagreement between "them" on how to respond to something.

So, I\'d say that playing such a character is *possible*, but *very*
difficult. The multiple players for one character approach would be one
way. But to do it "properly", they should only get to communicate via
notes. That is, the one who is currently running the character had best
leave notes about what he is doing and why. Otherwise when the "switch"
comes, the player getting control is not going to have any idea what\'s
going on. Contrary to popular belief, the personalities are generally
*not* concious of what occurs when they aren\'t in control. (I think
I\'ve heard something to the effect trhat this can change as the
personality starts to re-integrate, but I\'m not sure if that\'s known,
or just speculation).

Actually, it\'s fairly easy to show that while we think symbolically, we
do *not* do so in words. I know *I* have had the situation of having a
symbol (concept might be better) that there just *wasn\'t* a word for.
I\'n my mind it was a clear, simple thing. But it took hours to explain
to someone else, and even then I\'m sure that their "mapping" of the
concept was different from mine.

This actually makes sense given our knowledge of how things like
perceptrons and neural networks "store" knowledge. It\'s a
multidimensional "array" sort of thing. You have a bunch of inputs
(one per dimension) with a various value sets (yes/no, colors, etc).
The "concept" is a plane cutting through the array. If the inputs are
on one side of the plane, the output is "match", if they are on the
other side, the output is "doesn\'t match".

BTW, this is why it can sometimes be almost impossible to teach someone
something. The way they have their *existing" "concept planes"
configured, the new concept may be too close to several of the existing
ones. 

This gets seen when training neural nets. You can train one to
recognize some images, then feed it a new one and discover that once
you\'ve "trained" it to recognize a the new one, it no longer can
correctly identify one of the older ones. Train that one back in, and
it loses the other one. At that point, you either train some *other*
images, and then see if they broke the deadlock, or you clear the net
and retrain it from scratch, but make sure not to train the images in
the same order you tried last time!

Not true! It turns out that a *lot* of the basics of huiman language
are hardwired. Which makes telepathy a lot more likely to be workable.
Probing an alien (ie non-human) would be a lot harder. Vargr should be
much simpler because they are from the same planet, and not *that*
distantly related to us.

Much, much worse.

Heck, if there *weren\'t* barrels and the like, I\'d be worried that I
was trespassing on someone\'s mining claim. A sluice box is an old, but
quite effective method of getting gold dust out sand and gravel. 

Miner\'s don\'t like strangers wandering around either. :-)

I seriously doubt that anything bigger than a fighter will spend long
periods at more than 3 gees (uncompensated). And at 3 gees, you can get
out of the position and crawl to the john. :-)

Also, please consider just what *one* day* at a mere 3 gees *means*.

Here\'s what one day gets you:

	velocity	distance
accel	km/s	%c	km	AU
- ----	----	----	----	----
1	8.47e2	0.282	3.66e7	0.244

6	5.08e3	1.69	2.19e8	1.46

11	9.31e3	3.10	4.02e8	2.68
12	1.02e4	3.39	4.39e8	2.93

I think it\'s safe to say that no fight is going to involve as much as
*half* a day at any given acceleration.

Considering that *now* biomedical readouts can be provided by some very
*small* sensors attached in out of the way spots, that\'s not going to
be a problem.

"sidearm" controllers are like the "pistol grip" style joysticks.

You\'d use a keypad (probably chording) for most functions.

We have "heads up" displays *now* that are quite adequate. There\'s a
mono monitor that consists of a matchbox sized unit mounted off to one
side of an eye and a bit ahead.

Negative gees are *real* unlikely in space combat. Only thing that
would be likely to do it is having to change the ship\'s *orientation*
rapidly. And if the control room is near the center of the ship, thaty
won\'t matter much. The main drive is always going to be thrusting in
the same direction.

Frankly, I suspect that for combat, everybody suits up. You can use
heads up (or whatever) displays built into the helmet quite easily. The
suit needs to handle things like excretion anyway.

Again, *extended* operation at for than 3 gees is unlikely. Powered
armor will let you get around then. Though I expect that dropping
acceleration, or even cutting power is *not* a bad idea. After all,
anything aimed at where you *would* have been is going to miss by quite
a bit if you change acceleration by very much.

Methods I use include: Reworking Biblical Stories (Quite amusing, one of my
players had his character change name to Job).

The other method (for occasional use only) that I really like is to drop
them on a world, and let them do shoppy-store for a good long while, while
using the random encounter rules. Damn near killed three PC\'s during a
robbery of a jewelery store they were in.

Let your random encounters occur in situ; don\'t have the characters
encounter the npcs, have the NPC\'s come to the PC\'s. You wind up with some
really bizzare stuff (like 3d6 thugs encountered during a banquet at a
dukal palace...)

Another fun one is to mad lib before session, to fill a 1d table:
        Who     Did What        to whom         with what
1       PC(s)   ____________    the PC(s)       _______________
2       ______  ____________    ____________    _______________
3       ______  ____________    ____________    _______________
4       ______  ____________    ____________    _______________
5       ______  ____________    ____________    _______________
6       ______  ____________    ____________    _______________

Fill in table by asking your players for random types for the given
collumn. Then let it set a week, and roll once per collumn. Can be used
several times. Collect a variety, and you get a book of locally developed,
possibly campaign specific, re-useable random plot generators.

Well, um, no.  You\'re not familiar with FF&S, are you?  
The Hull *Material* Volume (HMV) mentioned above is actually a factor 
that is multiplied by the hull *thickness* to get the ACTUAL volume 
of the HULL material.  Not the volume enclosed by the hull, but  
the volume of the material making up the hollow shape that is a hull. 
 
And, when you take a close look at it, HMV is just SURFACE AREA. 
So, since HMV is surface area, saying Surface Area is HMV * 100 
isn\'t broken, it\'s just scaling to units used.  And misnaming of 
the relevant factor. 
 
The "hull form and airframe modifications" mentioned in the rules 
are your "shape factor".  The base number is not length squared,  
though; it\'s enclosed volume.  There\'s a factor to get length from 
enclosed volume (aka displacement), modified by hull shape; the 
basic length factor found on the hull size table is based on a 
spherical hull of the given displacement.  It\'s rather easy to 
derive the diameter of a sphere given the volume, don\'t you think? 
Modifiers for hull shape are based on the sphere having a multiplier 
of 1.0.

Obviously, the cylinder, cone, wedge, needle, rectangle, and slab 
hull lengths require a certain fixed length:beam ratio. 
 
The cylinder constant is off; someone forgot to include the endcaps 
in the surface area.  Other than that, backfiguring/reverse engineering 
led to: standard cone, 3:1 or less length:beam ratio, standard needle 
no greater than 6:1; others are fine, I think.  Oh, the Slab is fairly 
long, but I don\'t remember what L:B ratio it works out to. 
 
I did this a while back when I wanted to know what standard hull 
shapes to use to get a ship with a specific length:beam ratio. 
BTW, cone isn\'t a cone, it\'s a cylinder with a hemispherical cap, 
IIRC.

I\'ll get out my notes on this when I get home, and maybe even 
remember to post them.

Yep.  I worked out the most efficient hull shapes for a given 
purpose, and the best compromises sometime ago.  There\'s a 
good reason all my small ships in Steve\'s TCS game have spherical 
hulls.

Multiplied by the hull _Material Volume_, not by hull volume.  The
MV is based on a sphere of the given displacement, and the MVM
modifies this for hull config.  Again, this is Material Volume, not
Hull Volume. (The MV is a shell).

For a 100T hull (sphere) the volume is 1400kl, and the surface area
is 600m^2 (from FFS).  The hull radius is 7, so 3/7 * 1400 is 600.

Again, look at FFS.  And the post you quote.  MV is not volume.

Look at the passage agian. You don\'t multiply the volume by a fixed 
value, you multiply the material volume (MV) modified by the 
material voule modifiere (MVM). The MVM is dependent on hull
shape and airframe/no-airframe. So the 100 is just a scaling 
factor to make the right order of magnitude for square meter.

Ok, first off... My name is Pierre-Louis, not Louis-Pierre. :) 
Most anglophones just call me Piel (from P-L) because otherwise
they get confused. <ducks!!!!>

	I don\'t know wether you can actually copyrigth a system like
rpg rules; I suppose it\'s more a manner of copyrighting
look-and-feel, and that isn\'t a trivial problem.  Also you can\'t
copyright things like \'Empire\' and \'rockets\' and otehr sci-fi
concepts. :)

	I just know that what happened was this:  I found 1 of the
black books, I think it was Book 2.  From there on we tried to 
write our own sf game (being somewhat game-store deprived in
Sherbrooke at the time).  We ran into the Empire Galactique book, and
we saw that it was good, and very playable, and fun too.  Eventually
I managed to find the rest of the black book set so we switched over
to Traveller... Which didn\'t improve the game at all.  Just made it
more technical, which isn\'t necessarily a good thing.

	I think the biggest advantage of Traveller over Empire
Galactique was the design system.  Everything has its place and
capacity and everything, while in EG you can easily have things like
Ewoks fighting off a squadron of Trepida grav tanks... Because it\'s
more fantastique and, well, less down to earth. :)

	No, EG was never sold through the Valet D\'Coeur, as far as I
know.  It was sold through french-language libraries. (Demarc?
Whatever - those with the green signs :)  They also sell a lot of 
those HeroQuest books so basically they also carry RPG\'s in a way. :)

	I think that yes, the fact that there was less attention to 
\'mechanics\' made the game more playable.  On the other hand it had
simple and effective rules for the \'mechanical quality\' of equipment.
Everything was very well balanced-out.   Characters were never
completely helpless.  Technology is omnipresent, but not
in-your-face.  The game was more character/interaction oriented.

One proof of that is in the weaponry offered to the players; the two
more flagrant example were the karatapoigne and the \'needler\' (which 
we called the stitcher :).  The karatapoigne is a portable force
field around your wrist - when you hit someone, it acts like a cement
brick.  The needler is basically a snub pistol with tranqs.  You
just couldn\'t go thru an adventure without those, because you NEEDED
your ennemies alive so they could tell you what was going on and
stuff.

	Robots were also a staple of the game, because almost all
charcters got some sort of robot-interface skills.  Soldiers would
get battle-bot interfaces as well as cybernetic weapon-arms, 
archi-techs would get computer interfaces, etc etc.  

	It all gave the impression of being in an \'alien\' universe.

	In any case.  The book might still be in store, who knows. :)
	Oh... and the rules fit on the 3-4 last pages of the book. :)

Traveller Mag name: 
Here\'s a name I like, ripped off from an idea by someone on X-boat,
I think it was an HIWG person...

Actually, I\'ve GOT Atomic Horror. I think the Traveller: 1965 idea
would make an even better Worldbook! I personally would run it circa
1958 (I\'m an Art Deco nut), but what great fun!

 ^^^^^^^^^^^
This one has some history. "The Star Rovers" was a story series from 
DC comics. I\'ve seen them in reprint collections published in the
early \'70s, the "Stories from the Beyond" and similar titles. The originals
were first published in the \'50s, I believe.

The Star Rovers were three chums united by their love of space adventure.
There was the wealthy and handsome playboy, the beautiful and daring
fashion model, and the obligatory scientist. The stories were kind of
goofy, but fun.

<< Help!!!  This has nothing to do with Traveller, but I didn\'t know anywhere
 else to ask this question and expect to get a correct answer.
 
 I have an IBM clone and it has a Texas Instruments 486DLC chip in it.  I
 noticed not too long ago that it seemed to be operating slower than it had
 in the past.  I checked it with a benchmarking program and found that my
 processor that is rated at 38MHz is running at 7.4MHz (This is with Turbo
 on).  The only things I have done in the past is add a disk drive (I know
 have C: and D:, my CDROM is E:) and change a bad IO card out.  A while back
 I thought I was having trouble with my battery as well.  CMOS would not be
 there when I loaded the computer.  I got a battery, but when I changed out
 the I/O card, the problem went away (or I haven\'t had my computer off for a
 long enough time to notice).
 
 My question is, can anyone tell me what I might have done to make the
 computer operate so slow?  I\'ve tried disconnecting the extra (D:) disk
 drive, and tried using my old I/O card, and nothing seems to speed it up.  I
 played with the Jumpers tonight, and got it up to 8.5MHz, but I put them all
 back to where they were when I got the computer.
 
 Any help that wnyone can provide would be appreciated.  Sorry to waste the
 Bandwidth.

I suggest you check your CMOS ... the settings in there are most likely
messed up.... you might have too many pauses between clock cycles.... that\'d
sure slow you down!

        What, exactly, is the difference between flying a 100Td non-starship
("ship\'s boat" skill), and a 100Td starship ("pilot") skill in normal space?
One of the good things about TNE is it did away with the artificial distinction.

        And cope with MIJI (Meaconing, Jamming, Interference and Intrusion).
Meaconing (sending false navigational signals) isn\'t a problem, but a hostie
will certainly be interested in jamming; solar flares, etc. could cause
interference, and if an enemy can actually "steal" control of the fighter
from you (intrusion) ... hoo boy!

        Not that I\'m saying it wouldn\'t work ... just that it would be an
expensive proposition. And I just had a great idea ... imagine an Imperial
fleet carrier with several hundred RCV "fighters" of various sizes, with a
bizarre Virus...

        Not so sure about that. The Air Force once actually had a project to
build a nuclear powered cruise missile! Big problem was the radioactive
exhaust it spewed out over your own country ... and what if it accidentally
crashed? Even though the warhead wouldn\'t go, very not nice. I think it was
called "Pluto" (for the Roman or Greek god of the underworld, not Donald\'s dog).

MANY MANY Humongiod thanks to Derek Wildstar for his solution to my problem.
As you can see above it was the cache settings in CMOS.  I guess when the
battery goes dead, my computer reset these to "DISABLE" for some unknown
reason.  I am rather extremely computer illiterate and just barely know what
a cache is, much less what the setting should be, so I didn\'t change them.

Sorry for more waste of bandwidth, but I wanted to thank everyone that sent
me suggestions and I wanted everyone to know how smart Derek really is (or
how stupid I really am).  Anyway, thanks Derek, my computer was running at
45.6MHz the last time I checked the sysinfo program.

Not the same kind of thing, David.  The airplane prototype was to be a prop,
I think.  The reactor would have produced electricity to turn the props.  I
don\'t think there was any radioactive exhaust involved in the airplane
project.

>...and what if it accidentally crashed? 

Depends!  Reactor containers can take a lot without breaking
open..depending on design.  Shoot!  The risk or environmental
effects of crashes for a nuclear airplane wouldn\'t be any worse than for the
nuclear rockets favored in TNE.  <g>

Personally, I like the idea of the microwave or laser airplane.  It gets it\'s
power from orbiting stations and either converts it to electricity or uses it
as heat to power heat engines.  

You know if you have a big power source in GEO (solar power satellite for
instance), you can get ships into orbit *much* cheaper.  The SPS beams energy
as microwaves (most likely) to the orbital insersion vehicle where it is used
to heat the reaction gas...which could be air for part of the launch.

Oh!  You\'re *that* David Golden! <g>

You didn\'t get that published somewhere did you?  I remember seeing something

Alternatively, a significant part of the new Traveller rules have already
been reviewed in the last BITS newsletter. It may not now be 100% accurate
as it was written from an early draft and when proof-reading a later version
I noticed some bits seemed to have been left out, but hopefully IG have put
these back in... The review is at a preliminary BITS web page at:
http://www.wlihe.ac.uk/~Ward/bits.html (thanks Steven!)

Plus both Valkyrie and Arcane magazine in the UK are awaiting review copies
from IG; however, I believe they are close to their print deadlines so I
hope Ken gets the stuff to them soon! Arcane\'s even borrowed my Traveller
rules to photograph for their article. Hope the pictures come out ok!

Plus the next issue of the Traveller Chronicle should be announcing what I
believe will be the first official Milieu 0 supplement produced outside IG -
a rather good adventure entitled "The Long Way Home" from the CORE Traveller
writers group in association with Sword of the Knight publications.

        I didn\'t know that Mondale was anti-space.  Proxmire\'s reputation

        The reason for the accellerated timetable was to get the people
bopping around in spaceships while there were still fins on cars and beehive
hairdos on women :).  As for l\'Indochine, well I imagine that not pouring
money into colonial wars is a good way of funding your space program... for
both sides of the equation... so we get a Commie Korea and Vietnam.  Good:
it\'d just heighten the paranoia, as if Commie orbiting nukes wouldn\'t be
enough :).

        Well, whatever.  I do know that a constitutional amendment would
have been required, but that ties very nicely in with the slightly Orwellian
mood that I\'d be trying to create.  This of course means that the Kennedys
would have to be worked in somehow.  Hmmm....

        But your Marines do have their own air arm and their own amphibious
landing vessels, no?  I figured that in my alternate history, the Air Force
would have responsibility for aerospace fighters, orbiting nukes, and
generally the earth-space side of things, with the Army actually competing
with them for the funding and role (remember, I\'m gunning for a darkish
kitschy future here; interservice intrigue in the corridors of power in
Washington could actually make for some interesting adventures :)).  The
Navy would be running the big, nuclear-powered interplanetary ships, and the
Marines would be handling the drop troop role; orbit-to-ground craft and so
forth...

        Thruster plates :)!  Actually, having the Gray Aliens and Men in

shadowy adversaries/plot devices...  Imagine what happens when the CIA finds

        Naw; I\'d want a fairly dark (albeit rather funky) future and having

        Dark future, dude... Dark future...  This is just one way of making

        So the HUAC suddenly gets the impression that Martin Luther King is
secretly working for the Commies... wham; whole thing gets shut down.  Dark
future...  Not that I\'m trying to use it as a mantra or anything though :).
I figure that in this world the \'60\'s would never happen, although that

        Honestly, I doubt that I\'d have time anytime soon; school kicks in

nice spare-time project.

Sounds great!  As a longtime fan of early Clarke and Heinlien, this is the
perfect setting for a lot of their stuff (and I heartily recommend reading
up on it when creating the setting).  Check out: Heinlien\'s _The Man Who
Sold The Moon_ (and other stories from his "Future Histories" in _The Past
Through Tomorrow_), _Have Spacesuit, Will Travel_, _Space Cadet_, _Rocket
Ship Galileo_ (the very first SF I read), and take a look at Clarke\'s _A
Fall of Moondust_ (there are a few others Clarke has written that are
applicable, but the titles escape me).

Back in the 50\'s, not as much was known about the hazards of radiation.  To
make the "Terra: 1965" setting workable, you\'d have to assume that the
radiation hazard from fission power was a lot lower in that "universe".

To make the whole setting workable, you might want to do the following (as
changes from "standard" FF&S): double the power output of fission power
plants, and halve the minimum sizes.  This have the overall effect of making
fission plants smaller, lighter, and cheaper (to reflect the lower shielding
and radiation safety-requrements in the \'low-radiation\' universe).

If you want "atomic rockets" to exist, allow some type of drive to exist at
that TL.  Maybe a modified HEPlaR, changed so that it can be used with
fission plants, use water instead of hydrogen as reaction mass (but keep the
same volume, or even increase it).

Well, all the SF & Fantasy games pretty much prove the point.
The "spy" type games may or may not be "geeky". Toon is *beyond* geeky.

Does "Killer" count as an RPG? :-)

Um, Chris, I think you missed my earlier posts. Here, I was merely 
speculating as to why the *original* suggestion from Don was to use Book 
2 and High Guard. Certainly that changed, as players made their views 
known to IG. When I spoke to Don at Phenomenon, he enthused about QSDS 
and SSDS! He and David Golden are planning a re-release of FF&S (oh yes, 
YES, YES! <thwack> sorry, saw _Harry Met Sally_ once too often...[and 
this was BEFORE I read Liam\'s post]), with a much greater lead time than 
they allowed for SSDS (1 _week_, for goodness sake!).

I had two big "new science" leaps at TL16.  One was allowing any size Jump 
Drive for ships below 100 td (this is pre-TNE), and the second was to allow 
externally-powered Jump Drives.  What this meant was the ship needed to carry a 
Jump Drive and capacitors, but did not need the extra fuel and power plant 
equipment normally associated with a Jump Drive (a HUGE space savings).  The 
power came from a fixed device in deep space that the ship had to pass through 
- - A Jump Gate.  As it turned out, this was only useful for merchant/civilian 
vessels; the military would not want to be required to jump into a fixed point 
and would not want to be limited to a set of fixed points, so they stuck with 
the normal Jump Drives or carried both types (the new Jump Drive was different 
enough that the two technologies were not compatible).

And design rules for Drop Capsules.  Some would be decoys, some would deploy 
ordnance, and some would have more maneivering options than others.

And a completely different thing; disassemblable starships.  Something like the 
Covenant class in TNE (Scout with Close Escort), but allowing part of the ship 
to detach and function as an independant vessel.  This can be done in the 
current rules, but some specific guidlines would be good.

All the stuff you two brought up would be wonderful.  Is it done yet?

Another one in this mini-genre is "Firestar," which I just finished 
reading last night.  It is in hard back currently..and I don\'t remember 
the author\'s last name (first name: Michael).  If you\'re curious, ask me 
and I can post the name later...I just don\'t have the book with me here 
at work. :)

Anyway, this book doesn\'t re-write history.  Instead, it proposes a 
near-future (REALLY near; the setting is 1999 through 2006) wherein a 
powerful captain of industry manages to get a private space program 
going.  It\'s an interesting story, but it focuses mainly on the people, 
not the events or technology (although, the descriptions of technology 
are rather well-researched).  Not a bad book, overall (I /like/ it when 
stories focus on the people more than the setting), but I was a bit 
dissatisfied with the way the ending was written.  On a scale of 1 to 10, 
I give it a 7.

Hee! Hee!

So, use an energy form that\'s attenuated by the atmosphere.  <g>

Just lob the insersion vehicle up several kilometers with
conventional rockets and use the on-orbit power source for the rest of the
trip.  Better yet, use ground based lasers (power from SPS) to give the ship
the boost up through the atmosphere and then switch over to an orbital
source.

The ground based recievers could be spread out over hundreds of
kilometers of desert or other wasteland, keeping energy densities low enough
so as not to be much of a problem.

This definitely needs to be looked at to some extent - it\'s the key to
the whole fighter vs dreadnaught maneuverability thing.

I\'ve been peeking at my old physics texts a little on this, and here are
a few numbers.  Looking at 20 Td, 200 Td, and 20k Td hulls with a
spherical config for ease of calculations (can anyone say "cylindrical
horse"?  I knew you could!) and assuming constant density (OK, I\'m a
little lazy today <G>) we get radii of 4.06, 8.74, and 40.6 meters
respectively.  

Now to move at 6G in a given direction, the engines need to be aimed the
other way, assuming that the design rules are for a single set of
thrusters aligned with the main axis of the ship.  This is where the
attitude thrusters above come in.  There are two considerations here:
the greatest amount of acceleration felt (which will be at the outer
radius of the sphere) and the amount of energy necessary to spin the
hull.

ACCELERATION
The maximum acceleration limits the speed with which the vessel can spin
around.  I\'m assuming a constant angular acceleration to spin the ship. 
It could be optimized by starting with a maximum ang accel which
decreases to zero at the turn around point then increases in the other
direction.  This would put a constant linear acceleration load on the
grav compensators while minimizing spin time.  i.e. at TL 15 the 6G will
be due to the spinning thrust at the beginning and end of the turn and
centripetal acceleration only at the turn around point with a mixture of
the two in between.  I don\'t feel like playing with the calculus though,
so punt that! <G>

So we\'ve got a constant angular acceleration which reverses direction at
the halfway point.  Since the maximum angular velocity is at the halfway
point, this is also the point of maximum linear acceleration. A bit of
algebra shows that the spin time is prop. to the sqrt of the radius of
the sphere and inversely prop. to the sqrt of the G limit.  This is the
absolute TL imposed limit, assuming that crew members are using no accel
couches, tanks, etc.  Of course, a craft with all crew in couches or
such (more likely for a fighter than a dreadnaught) would have an
advantage, since they could add G\'s.  Additionally, placing the crew
near the center of rotation would effectively increase the G-limit, as
long as the outer structure was braced for the additional G\'s.  This
could be particularly handy for a fighter with the crew placed at the
COG.

Of course, the sqrt of r is a smaller advantage than might be expected
for a fighter over a warship.  Example calculations for turn around time
with a limit of 6G gave:

Disp(Td)	Rad(m)	Time(s)

20		4.06	1.69
200 		8.74	2.48
20k		40.6	5.34
spec*		1.0	0.84	

*This is with a single pilot in the center of a fighter

ENERGY
The other limitation, which is actually more critical for large vessels,
is the the amount of work which must be done to get the thing turned
around.  This is the energy added to the (presumably) stationary sphere
to get it rotating to the halfway point, plus the energy needed to stop
it.  The energy added for a given rotational speed is prop to the moment
of inertia which is equal to the square of the radius times the mass. 
Assuming mass prop to disp <g>, and since radius is prop to the cube
root of the displacement, the energy is prop to the 5/3 power of the
disp.  

This means that a 10k Td vessel will require 100k times as much energy
to spin around in the same time as a 10Td fighter, even though it masses
only 1k times as much.  For the turn-around times given above, the
following amounts of energy are
consumed:

Disp(Td)	Time(sec)	Energy(MJ)
20		1.69		18.2
200		2.48		392
20k		5.34		182k

Note that the energy figrues for the bigger ships would be much higher
if they were able to turn as fast as the fighter.

Even if the maneuver drive necessary to impart this energy and the
structural reinforcement necessary to take the acceleration in varying
directions is ignored, the energy output will obviously limit the
maneuverability (agility) of large ships.  Particularly since the
fighter can afford to burn all its fuel in a couple of hours and refuel,
while the ships of the line need to be able to hold out for a while.

There is a drastic need to put an agility fix in the rules.

Sorry about the length of this, but this topic has been bothering me for
a while now.

    'body' => '"How do you get the ideas for plot developments in your game?"

I was asked this once by a player and absolutely horrified him with my
response.  I told him that, every week, a book full of plot ideas was
dropped on my doorstep.

Going to the television, I picked up the program listing and proceeded
to read the "one line" synopsis of movies playing that week.  After
finding one that "felt right" I proceeded to warp the description by
substituting characters and events in the game for the stars and
elements of the movie.

For example, for the Superhero game I was running at the time:
    STAR WARS: Old wise man tells young farmer he is heir of fallen
    hero.  The boy joins the rebellion and helps beautiful rebel
    princess attack overwhelming Imperial battle-station.

    Hmmm... Let\'s start with the "new weapon" for the bad guys.
    Maybe someone discovers Soulweaver\'s old base on the moon.
    Someone that knows enough to use what they find, but not
    enought to be to subtle.  Sounds like a job for Ravenwing. Now
    we need a "fallen hero," preferably one connected to the
    Liberty (the PC hero group) that has "gone bad," since *we*
    know what happened to the fallen hero in STAR WARS.  How about
    this "Lion" guy from the Rhodesian Super-SWAT team?.  Oops, no,
    he\'s dead.  Hmmm...  Double Hmmm... even better.  We can turn
    the "father of farm boy" into "mentor of young super" and make
    Thunderbird (PC and member of Liberty, ex-member of the
    Rhodesian Super-SWAT team) central to this plot.  We need
    someone to find out about Ravenwing and bring the information
    to Liberty.  Perhaps a daughter or grand-daughter of one of the
    Rhodesians.  Ur... Teufulhund (Note: Need to look up "Devil
    Dog" in German or whatever it is they speak in South Africa) a
    beautiful young girl that knows of Thunderbird.

    OK, how\'s this.  Ravenwing and Co. find Soulweaver\'s lair on
    the Moon.  They discover something that makes them Too Powerful
    and they start trouncing their enemies, possibly including
    Liberty.  (Scenario #1:  Ravenwing attacks) Teufulhund brings
    information about the source of Ravenwing\'s new abilities to
    our heroes, perhaps Ravenwing is "mopping up" her mother\'s
    super-team and she comes to Thunderbird for help.  I wonder
    what TBird\'s wife will say, not only about the beautiful young
    girl that has attached herself to TBird, but about his
    ..unseemly..  past?  (Scenario #2: Ugly past and Untimely
    Angst)  Eventually, our heroes will contact enough folks and
    dig up enough Power or Subtlety to confront Ravenwing.
    (Scenario #3 & #4: Figuring out what is going on and beating up
    the bad guys.) Sometime during these last two, Liberty
    discovers that Ravenwing is being helped by Daedalus, the
    Master Planner, who is actually TBird\'s old leader, Lion. (The
    rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated.) Oh! The
    Horror! :-)

There is at least six sessions (six to eight weeks) of gaming in this,
and all the gross plotting was just done off the top of my head, and
took about fifteen minutes.  Do one more, weave the plots around each
other, and you have almost six months of general plot line ready.

While this is a superhero scenario, I could have just as easily started
with any other movie in the book and warped the story elements into a
science fiction game.  I\'ve done it before, and you can too.  And it
Really, Really works... :-)

Hope this helps...

   The nuke aircraft (that DID in fact fly) was a simple heat-exchanger
that operated much the same as the heat cycle in a normal jet engine.

   It had problems with radioactive *parts* and some mishaps resulting in
radioactive debris being scattered across the American midwest.
Fortunately, most was over military reserves.

   The reactor and it\'s radioactive parts are still buried at a base
somehwere.

[further description of random encounter system deleted]

I have found random encounters to be good spurs to the imagination.  As 
you mentioned, coming up with the reason for such bizarre-seeming 
encounters as 6 thugs in a palace can be interesting and fun.

Still, I don\'t do the randomized encounters very often.  Just when I\'m 
stuck for an idea.

I might have read the Guiness Book of World Records wrong, but I think 
that it\'s the other way \'round.  Plutonium is the most toxic material 
known (or at least was in 1985 or so).  Of course, it\'s got lots of other 
nasty properties, too.  For instance, it\'s so reactive that it\'ll spark 
on contact with other metals.  If it\'s being machined, it must occur in 
an inert gas atmosphere to keep the shavings from bursting into flame on 
contact with oxygen.  Once it\'s burning, it\'s damn hard to extinguish.

Of course, lots of elements at the bottom of the periodic chart are nasty 
like that.

Grant Sinclair and Mike Mikesh have had a look at Tavonni, and given back 
some useful and constructive criticism. One point that Grant made is that 
the information is interesting, but somewhat dry.

The main reason for this, I think, is due to the requirement for 
"fast-forwarding" the setting to TNE. This means that all the potential 
NPCs are *dead*, and since we don\'t actually play in TNE, I have no new 
ones to share.

Now, since the advent of the "Mileau" thing, things might improve. here 
then, is the first of two "sidebars" detailing some of the principals of 
Tavonni.

Tavonni Sidebar: Caradoc LIC

Count Leto Khaanraarshuinki (a retired Fleet Admiral) and Gukushriiken (a
retired Army general) mustered out at Regina (SM 1910) on 001-1099. The
two had met each other during their service lives, and decided to team up
and pool their resources (which included their retirement benefits and
Leto\'s family fortune). They joined forces with two ex-Scouts and a
merchant, and began trading. 

By 1101, they had grown to include five scout ships and six merchantmen. 
The group moved to the Outrim Void (actually to the Egryn subsector,
Trojan Reach), established Caradoc LIC, and began securing footholds on
various worlds in the region. Experiencing security difficulties (with
pirates, locals, and other merchants), Caradoc hired an Aslan merc company
from the Darrian Consulate. The Aslan were paid in cash, and by land
grants purchased by Caradoc. 

In 1104, miners working for Caradoc made a lanthanum strike in the Egryn
subsector. The announcement made Caradoc\'s share price rise dramatically,
and the company poured its increased capital back into trading (still the
heart of the business). In 1112, Caradoc announced it had discovered the
Bright Light, an Azhanti High Lightning-class cruiser that had gone
missing in the Outrim Void in 1108. Claiming salvage rights, they were
able to make the ship part of their fleet. By 1117, the trading
corporation was worth TCr 1. 

When Leto and Gunderlinyou learned of the death of Strephon, they foresaw
trouble in the Outrim Void. Guessing at the probable response of the
ihatei - with knowledge gained from trading with them - led them to a
decision to abandon their trading bases and retreat to the Marches. 
Although costly, Leto saw it as a better choice than losing the lot -
which was his forecast. 

While scouring the Marches for a new base, Leto cut a deal with LSP to
become a subsidiary company. This gave Caradoc access to much-needed
contacts within the Marches, and provided another capital base to draw
upon. When the scouts returned, Leto decided that Tavonni was the best
choice for a base. It was uninhabited, with land available for his Aslan; 
it was in the under-developed Vilis subsector, giving the company enough
elbow-room to expand; and it was centrally located. 

Leto travelled to Regina to personally petition Archduke Norris for the
Tavonni system, where he met Baroness Heidi Maria Heyerdahl of Menelvagor
Ltd.

Here is the second of the Tavonni sidebars, detailing the backgrounds of 
some of those involved in creating Tavonni.

- ----
Tavonni Sidebar: Menelvagor LIC

Menelvagor Ltd was originally a Sword World company, created by Beowulf
Heyerdahl.. He was the second son of Baron Heyerdahl of Tizon (SM 0922). 
In 1100, Beowulf mustered out from the Sword Worlds Patrol Service on his
homeworld, took his inheritance as a second son and went trading. 
Initially, he simply booked passage and paid for starship freight costs. 
After chancing on a cache of gems at Beater (SM 1424), his wealth reached
MCr 40, and he decided to create a company for financial management
reasons (mostly to lower his tax). 

Beowulf established Menelvagor Ltd on 059-1101, pouring his fortune into
the company. He headed into the Imperium, continuing to trade and to "see
the sights" - a true traveller. In mid-1102, a profitable load of
computers increased Menelvagor\'s capital to nearly MCr 200. The company
commissioned the Mithril Wanderer, which served as its flagship for the
next ten years. By 1105, Menelvagor was worth over MCr 300, and
commissioned the design of the 12,810-ton armed merchant cruiser,
Bonaventure. 

The outbreak of the Fifth Frontier War led to instability and an eventual
rebellion on Tizon. In 1108, Beowulf\'s father and older brother were
killed. His older sister Heidi Maria (now Baroness) managed to escape in a
single ship with her closest associates. She took what she could of the
family fortune, mostly transportable items such as gold, gems, and cash,
to the value of MCr 100. Heidi toward Regina, Beowulf\'s last known
location. Stopped at Garda-Vilis, she managed to obtain clearance into
Imperial space as a "refugee" (after sufficient bribery). However, travel
toward Regina was blocked due to the invading Zhodani 40th Fleet. Heidi
decided to trade around Vilis subsector until 1109, making many trading
contacts. 

Beowulf was actually at Dentus (SM 2201), acquiring a load of weapons
(including ship nukes) from a destroyed Vargr fleet. He used his armed
cruiser to transport these outside the Imperium to Utoland (SM 1209),
trading arms for gems and increasing capital to nearly MCr 500. 
Returning, he traded the gems at Kinorb (SM 2202) for a huge profit,
bringing capital to over MCr 650. 

Heidi headed for Regina in mid-1109, only to be stopped at Equus by the
Zho invasion. She traded in the area, discovering the "Golden Triangle" 
of crowded and industrialised Heroni (SM 2521), rich agricultural Byret
(SM 2523), and poor Fosey (SM 2621). However, pirates from Skull (SM 2420)
discovered that Heidi was shipping valuables. 

In early 1110, Heidi was able to proceed towards Regina. The pirates,
following behind, missed her trail and headed for Regina. Beowulf, in the
meantime, had left the Bonaventure at Kinorb and headed to Regina in the
Mithril Wanderer. Confusing his activities with those of Heidi\'s, the
pirates attacked and destroyed his ship in the Regina system, killing
Beowulf. The Navy, responding to Beowulf\'s distress call, destroyed the
pirates. 

Heidi arrived to find her brother dead, with his company fortune left to
his "closest surviving relative". She then had to prove her identity in
order to claim his body for burial and his fortune. Two and a half months
later, her claim was accepted. The combined total of their fortunes was
worth MCr 800. Heidi elected to take over Menelvagor Ltd, and her skilful
handling allowed the company\'s worth to reach MCr 3,000 by 1117. 

Just after establishing her identity, Baroness Heidi was invited to a 
function at Duke Norris\' household. Here she met Count Leto Khaanraarshuinki 
of Caradoc LIC.

I used to have library priveleges at an airbase. One interesting book I
found in the library was a book on the nuclear powered airplane
program. There were a *lot* of different designs. Everything from the
one that used reactor generated steam to drive turbines that drove
propellers (a nuclear turboprop!), to the "nuclear ramjet" (quite
similar to something Clarke described in Prelude to Space).

Picture a reactor built around a ceramic lined air channel and designed
to operate at *very* high temperatures. It heats the air hot enough to
make it work like a ramjet. For startup, you use a "shutter" assembly
to make it a pulsejet. When you get high enough to start running out of
air, you start pumping in some fluid to vaporize and replace air as the
reaction mass. Ammonia works well.

Not NERVA, but a lot nicer to be around for takeoff.

BTW, I was re-reading an old favorite yesterday. Andre Norton "The
Stars Are Ours!" The setting is earth after a disaster that left
much of the more populous parts of the northern hemispere not just
depopulated, but "burned off" (Norton\'s term for blasting large
segments of a planetary surface into radioactive slag). It was blamed
on scientists, so there were purges and the like. 

It\'s now decades later and the dictatorship that has control is hunting
down the last of the scientists. They\'ve got a hidden base with a ship
that may be capable of interstellar flight, but would take a *long*
time. They\'ve just worked out "cold sleep", and they manage to escape.

The second half takes place on a the world they colonize. It apparently
had its own war. And the nasties there still survive, but nowhere near
our heroes.

There\'s a sequel titled "Star Born". It has an expedition using a "jump
drive" reaching the planet. 

Without too much trouble, you could file off some serial numbers and
use large chunks of both for background in exploring the territory that
was lost during the Long Night. Have the "burn off" be due to an attack
on the planet, and keep or get rid of the dictatorship part. You can
also use the planet the folks on the sleeper ship colonized, and have
the same problems with them thinking you are from the "bad guys" their
ancestors had fled.

I also now have the names of the 4 Norton books about the Solar Queen
(a free trader) and her crew.

1. Sargasso of Space
2. Plague Ship
3. Voodoo Planet
4. Postmarked the Stars

In "Sargasso of Space", we see how the Scout Service auctions off
trade rights to newly discovered planets. Basicly, you get the
exclusive right to any trading with the planet for a certain period.
After that, anybody can trade with them. Hopefully, you\'ll find some
good trade items and some unique ones. And by the time your "lock"
expires, you\'ll be in *real* good with the natives.

It also has a ship being chartered to haul and archeological expedition
to explore some Forerunner (Ancients) remains on a newly discovered planet.
A planet that has been mostly "burned off".

In "Plague Ship", we get to see a Free Trader trying to open up trade
with natives, and looking for items that are worth hauling. Gemstones
are one, but some of the others may surprise you. 

There\'s also the not so minor problem of finding something the natives
*want* in exchange for the stuff you want. This too, can have it\'s
surprises. 

We also see some of the things that can "get" you when dealing with new
planets.

And we get to see the "Big Burn" on Terra (the mess made by the
accident/war in "The Stars Are Ours!". This gives ideas for what you
might find on war devasted planets. Or even just *weird* planets. I
won\'t spoil the story by going into detail.

Voodoo Planet has the Free Traders visting a planet settled by
Africans. Definitely good for the bit about seeing how a non-Western
culture transplanted to another planet can surprise you.

And "Postmarked the Stars" has the crew discovering the sort of
adventures you can get into while acting as a susidized freighter on a
mail run.

Other Norton books that deal with Free Traders or aliens in a manner
that may be useful to Traveller players. (groups indicated sequels,
trilogies, etc).

That\'s the NFPS (National Fire Protection Society?) diamond. The upper
three sections are colored (red, yellow and blue, I forget the order). 
The bottom section is reserved for graphical symbols indicating special
hazards. 

I may have which sub-diamond is which wrong, and I\'m only approximating
the explanations of the numerical values.

  Top: Flammability hazard
Right: Explosive hazard
 Left: Toxicity hazard

Each hazard has a numerical rating from 1 to 4. The scheme is roughly this:

1. no hazard
2. some hazard
3. hazardous
4. *extremely* hazardous

Some of the graphical symbols for the bottom diamond are things like
the graphic for "corrosive" (a drop from a test tube eating a hole in
something) and the radiation trefoil.

There are books and booklets available giving the ratings for various
chemicals. I got mine (which is in storage at the moment) from the
local Comunity College bookstore when the firefighter course was
changing textbooks. Mine was one of "outdated" books.

Now you can see why a 4-4-4 rating will give a knowledgable person the
willies! And pity the poor trader who has signed the contract *before*
he finds out the cargo is 4-4-4.

        Could be, I didn\'t pay much attention to journals when I first
graduation. There were about 20 of us in the group. We did the work in \'88,
for NASA Langley (IIRC). I don\'t think I even have a copy of the final

Fulcrums\' Measure: The Coalition of Worlds Campaign

It is late 1209 and the RC (now part of the Coalition of Worlds and =

Subsidized Trader network and a more unified front has allowed the =
Reformers to become the driving force between the New Era. Having =
"tamed" the Empire of Solee and pushed back the Vampire fleet to Core =
subsector attention has been turned to the maintaining the "Cold War =
with the Regency and their expansionist and imperialist mindsets, the =
disturbing genocide attacks on the CWI\'s  Rimward edge by the K\'kree and =
their mercenaries, and lastly to further exploration to the trailing =
edge of the RC boundaries=20

The first, inevitable conflict with the Regency came in late 1204 when a =
squadron of ships from the Spinward Marches made their presence known.=20
In a tribute to the Arrival Vengeance mission eight decades ago, a fleet =
of Azhanti Class ships arrived at the RC\'s  doorstep. Their original =
mission was to lead a dangerous drive through to Margaret\'s\'
old domain, assessing the virus presence and possible future colony =
worlds. They had made the trip by way of the Great Rift, and a small =
group of Aslan support ships from the New Ihatei rulers had traveled =
with them.  When the Regency fleet learned of the growing RC they were =
not prepared for the stiff anti-imperial resolve of these people.  At =
first relations are
reserved and tempered. Popular opinion of the Regents were of mute =
disgust. The Regents talked of restoring the Imperium and that was =
antithesis of RC doctrine and belief.=20
But to the Regents the chilling fact that  the people of the Coalition =
had accepted Virus as an
ally,  proved to be the most decisive factor in RC and Regency =
relations.
Promise showed briefly for awhile that there may be an acceptable common =
ground for the two powers when the Regency fleet supported  the RC in =
the battle that crippled the power of the Solee.  It was a short lived =
alliance that only further exaggerated the differences between the two.=20

The Regents left with cold words,  any group of people who accept Virus =
as an equal sentient, will have no place in the new Imperium. It was =
obvious now that the Regency planned to reestablish their kinder, =
gentler Imperium on all of humanity. To the RC nothing could be worse. =
The next year was spent busily annexing the Empire of Solee and =
beginning open relations with the Hub worlds.=20

The Covenant of Sufren became a port for forward operations into the =
Frontier (as it was not called the Wilds anymore with news of other =
human pocket empires.) and from this vantage the Vampire fleet was =
driven back to Core.  An alliance born out of mutual, protectionism =
interests,  formed the largest human alliance, outside of the Regency, =
in the old imperium states.  The RC, The Empire of Solee the Hub Worlds =
the Grayln Union, and even the Merchants guild had begun to reclaim =
humanities former glory.  These worlds resisted Regency expansionism as =
well, further perpetuating the "cold war" between the Regency and the =
newly aligned Coalition of Worlds and Interests.

In 1206 a group of Balduri scouts made their way down the Antrallian =
main where,at the
old scout base at Antraillia (Alpha Leonis/ Crucis 0306) they made an =
exciting discovery.  A small population of interstellar travelers who =
were revived Imperial and Solomani Remnants, had established (with =
infamous hiver influence)an interstellar  alliance made up of  three =
worlds  These energetic nomadic explorers would prove to be the vanguard =
mission to recontact Earth in the New Era.

 The adventure as written assumes the players to be both members
of the RC and of Imperial Era Remnants revived by
the RC in 1204.  This is by no means meant to restrict the Referee
to these actions by imposing them on the players, but, they are
an aid in roleplaying that you may find works with your playing
group.  Fulcrums Measure is a campaign that draws a lot from Traveller
history both the RC and the Imperium  and is meant to exploit the
differences in the culture of different eras in ways that
require role-playing.




It is late 1204 and the RC is experiencing growing pains.  With the =
breaking of the guild and the establishment of the now subsidize trader =
network.  Earlier in the year a shocking surprise came to the RC. =
Visitors from the Old Imperial Spinward Marches made their presence =

The scuttlebutt was enormous and the stories the Regents brought with =
them were astounding.  They had made their way to this area by way of =
the Great Rift.  A small group of Aslan Support ships from the New =

the RC.  At first relations are reserved if not a bit "stiff".  Popular =

trader league was that  the Hub Worlds existed and was ready for trade.  =
But the chilling fact of having accepted  the Sandman Virus as an ally =

That\'s too bad. I would have preferred golden innocence with brave, but

I like the idea of those "Torch ships" of that era\'s SF.

Now that\'s one I never thought of. Heck, you could pick up one of those 
huge "TV Movie Guides" that have thousands of movie synopses, and have 
enough plots to draw for the rest of your life. 

Nicely done!  Thanks for posting that.

I\'ve been working on a Traveller close combat system for a couple of weeks,
It should be ready about the time that MMT is released, and I\'ll have it
avalible on my web page for downloads.

The system is called _AT CLOSE QUARTERS_, and is designed to simulate
intense fights in small areas like starships, pressure domes, and the like.
I\'m using an Action Point system similar to that used in Snapshot and
Azhanti High Lightning, but with a few twists (You can burn up all of you
APs trying to get off the first shot, for example).

What I need from y\'all is some feedback on what you want to see in ACQ.
Remember short range for now, so discussion of telescopic scopes and the
like are right out.  I want a combat system that will leave players sweating
as they wonder if they should spend their last two AP and open the hatch, or
cower with gun ready..

Ball is in your court, ladies and gentlemen and Vargr, oops, sorry.. that\'s
a hand grenade.

At least one version of this went under the name "Project Pluton".  It was
reported not long ago (at most a couple or three years) by Air&Space
Smithsonian magazine.  The ramjet engine was intended for a sophisticated
cruise missile application: the missile was to be an unmanned bomber, and
deliver multiple atomic bombs to different targets.

A prototype engine was built and statically tested.  The ceramic engine core
was made by A. Coors & Co of Colorado (at that time, the company was a major
manufacturer of ceramic vessels for the brewing industry).  Even though the
engine operated at a few degrees shy of the ceramic core\'s failure temperature,
the thing aparrently worked.

The project was finally ended when nobody could figure out a way of
flight-testing the engine, or even a place where it could be tested safely.

Plutonium\'s *chemical toxicity* is 1/30th that of Arsenic. The much
vaunted "most toxic material on earth" bit is based on what the
radaition does if the plutonium gets into your bones and sits there for
a long time. In more realistic terms, plutonium isn\'t even in the
running.

The amount it takes to kill you (via long term cancer or the like) is a
lot larger than things like botulina toxin.

That\'s true of a *lot* of metals. most of the metals from the
transition sections of the periodic chart are either very stable (the
iron/nickel/cobalt group and the platinum and rhodium groups) or else
they are very reactive.

Heck, there\'s a specific type of fire extinguisher for "exotic metal
fires" (Class D).

You\'re not suggesting that "our friend the atom" is dangerous, are you? Hey,
you must be some kind of commie! Police!

Seriously, I would halve the required shielding, and take a good look at the
long term effects of radiation exposure. Remember, this is 1965, and an
accelerated technology version at that.  Leornard wanted a dark future,
here\'s part of it.

Oliver Stone\'s screenplay of ID4 was unfortunately rejected, but went 
something like this:

A young Bill Gates worked for a time at Area 51 as a civilian contractor,
analyzing the Roswell vehicle.  The Roswell vehicle\'s systems have always
been more or less functional.  He figured out how its computer software
worked, and realized that it could be run, but slowly, on IBM mainframes. 
When he left Area 51, he set out to develop DOS, which is based entirely
on alien algorithms (as anyone who has used DOS will testify).  DOS
eventually mutated into Windows, and effectively conquered the world. 

The aliens arrive and are able to take over our satellite systems because
their communications software is compatible with ours.  (Query whether 
the Roswell crash was really an accident -- or did the aliens want to 
saddle us with computer operating systems that would keep us weak and 
off-balance?)

They then begin their swath of destruction and conquest.  David ends up in
Area 51, and spends a little time with the Roswell craft.  He soon
realizes that the whole world is actually running alien software on 75% of
its computers (or whatever Microsoft\'s market share is).  He also realizes
that the software is inherently kludgy and prone to failure, and starts to
write a simple virus on his PowerPC (so Apple gets its product placement,
but the virus is still IBM/MS compatible) to take advantage of the
weaknesses in the Windows BEM ("Bug Eyed Monsters") operating system.  He
soon realizes, however, that he\'ll never get the virus done in time to
save the world, but in flash of inspiration realizes that a virus that
maximizes the problems of the Windows system already exists! 

Soon, he and Capt. Hiller are aloft and being captured by the mother ship. 
The mother ship contacts the Roswell craft.  After the mother ship\'s and
the Roswell craft\'s computers have shaken hands, David uploads his virus,
which causes all systems aboard the mother ship and every ship linked to
it to crash as their computers\' memories get completely consumed. 

That\'s right, David uploads Windows95.

    yes and no... The Third Imperium did control who got the J-5 and J-6
ships by means of having repersentitives on or in all the major banks that
would finance the purchase of same.   If some group that was not to well
thought of did come up with the capital, the bureaucratic mase of forms and
permits would prevent delivery until a \'construction accident\' could be
arranged to force a complete scrap of the hull and starting again.  With
construction times excceding a year, this is not a insignifficant delay, so,
most people would take there insurance payoff and quit.  All sorts of things
could happen to affect the construction, the shipyard could be put into
bankruptcey, the shipyard could loose it certification licence.   And most
of these subtle forms of control, with some lesser effect, would extend to
client state areas and fringe border worlds.
    This control by means of influence is not by any means \'airtight\', it is
just a filter so to speak.  J-6 ships will get built before there owners get
identified as hostile to Imperial/Megacorperation/Local High Noble
interests.   The new owners have there own influence and bureaucratic
manuvering skill to bring to bear.  A few high jump capacity ships in
non-imperial forces / non-megacorperation hands is not seen as a direct
threat, but something to be watched.  The most concern would be a rival to
the J-6 information relay network, which would be very hard to do with just
one ship.   As a rival on trade routes the megacorps (or even large corps)
would move in there own J-6 ships and under bid you until you went away, if
this was a trade route they really wanted.
   As a final back-up, if the owners are truly hostile to Imperial well
being, they will break some law, and become the targets of the Imperial navy
and/or law enforcement.

All of this is \'In My Humble Opinion\', and how I run my campaign.

I doubt the Third Imperium would have this pervasive of 
control...  And define a major bank...  Probably any bank that had 
operations on any world with a decent size pop, a class A starport 
and a TL 14-15 world...which is what we\'re talking about at Jump 5 or 
6...is going to be able to finance the construction of starships...  
We\'d be talking hundreds of banks on any single world...  Yes there 
might be a few major players with major market share, but Fred\'s 
community bank on Australia should be able to fund a few starships...

Of course, going back to my economic argument...  They might have a 
hard time justifying where the money is going to come from to pay 
back the loan, if they\'re a small operation...

It won\'t be exclusively megacorps that run J-5 & 6 ships, but if 
you\'ve got PC\'s running independently owned Jump 6 ships as tramp 
freighters, things are particularly realistic either.

I say again, that its going to take a fairly large operation to be 
able to afford to run expensive J-6 ships that can\'t in and of 
themselves break even carrying cargo or speculative cargoes...

It isn\'t even really a good investment for planetary navies to run 
J-6 ships...

Actually, everything I\'ve seen of the Imperium tells me that they 
wouldn\'t interfere in such matters unless they perceived them to be a 
grave threat to internal/external security...

If Earth is any example, the Imperium will be very reluctant to sell 
their best technology to any but the best of friends under most 
circumstances...

Generally speaking, its going to take a large operation to do 
this...and a larger operation is either going to tow the Imperial 
line...at least outwardly, or they\'ll get squashed like a bug by a 
Megacorp/Imperial combination...  

The Imperium could probably give a rip about whether a PC group owns 
a J-5 or 6 ship, as long as they pay the bills, and don\'t engage in 
piracy...  But if they start buying lots of them, and begin running a J-6 
Fed Ex style service???  Then things would get sticky...

  Cover fire (overwatch) and suppression fire are an absolute necessity.
Any system that doesn\'t take that into account is nothing but an arcade
shoot-em-up. I like to see a system where realistic tactics work.

  Make people predeclare their AP usage before following up. eg: "I\'m
firing a burst and ducking behind the barrel"

Example: a  wedge shape recieving hostile (or freindly) fire from the bow-on
direction, if hit someplace other than right on the nose, would likely
encounter a 60 degree plus angle slope to the hull.   If this was a vehicle
vice starship design that armor slope would cause a doubling of the armor
effect.
   I suppose that effects could be calculated for all twenty surface areas
of the ship, but an additional complication for recieving fire from the
broadside arc is ship rotation around it\'s main fore/aft axis.  At one point
in the rotation the angle of incoming fire could be close to 90 degrees,
(hull surface location 10) coming down from the top side of the ship.   As
the ship rotates around the angle of incoming fire would see more and more
\'slope\' until the ship was edge-on (hull surface locations 7,9,13, and 15)
as viewed from the attacker.   Futher rotation would bring you back to
almost a 90 degree incomming angle (hull surface location 11) as shots come
up at the bottom of the ship.

Any ideas on a playable solution to this?

***** ID4 SPOILERS ARE COMING UP *****




**** JUST A FEW MORE LINES TO THE ID4 SPOILERS *****



Oliver Stone\'s screenplay for Independence Day was unfortunately rejected,
but went something like this:

A young Bill Gates worked for a time at Area 51 as a civilian contractor,
analyzing the Roswell vehicle.  The Roswell vehicle\'s systems have always
been more or less functional.  Gates figured out how its computer software
worked, and realized that it could be run, but slowly, on IBM mainframes.
When he left Area 51, he set out to develop DOS, which is based entirely on
the Roswell craft\'s computer\'s alien algorithms (as anyone who has used DOS
will testify).  DOS eventually mutated into Windows, and effectively
conquered the world.

The aliens arrive and are able to take over our satellite systems because
their communications software is compatible with ours -- query whether the
Roswell crash was actual an intentional act by the aliens, to give us
computer systems that would keep us perpetually off-balance and weak.  

The aliens then begin their swath of destruction and conquest.  David ends
up in Area 51, more or less per the final script, and then spends some time
with the Roswell craft. He soon realizes that the whole world is actually
running alien software on 75% of its computers (or whatever Microsoft\'s
market share is).  He also realizes that the software is inherently kludgy
and prone to failure, and starts to write a simple virus on his PowerPC (so
Apple gets its product placement, but the virus is still IBM/MS compatible)
to take advantage of the weaknesses in the WindowsBEM ("Bug Eyed Monsters")
operating system.  He soon realizes, however, that he\'ll never get the virus
done in time to save the world, but in flash of inspiration realizes that a
virus that maximizes the problems of the Windows system already exists!

Soon, he and Capt. Hiller are aloft and are captured by the mother ship.
The mother ship contacts the Roswell craft.  After the mother ship\'s and the
Roswell craft\'s computers have shaken hands, David uploads his virus, which
causes all systems aboard the mother ship and every ship linked to it to
crash as their computers\' memories get completely consumed. 

That\'s right, David uploaded Windows95.

     Why use fighters if they can\'t achieve greater acceleration than a 
     capital ship? Because they\'re FASTER. 
     
     ?Huh? It\'s true. A fighter in space can be launched with the same 
     initial speed as the carrier, PLUS whatever velocity the launch tubes 
     give (don\'t tell me that launch tubes are just long gunbarrels that 
     the fighter flies down, a la some crummy space opera - those buggers 
     are magnetic railguns that shoot fighters into the sky). 
     
     So a 6G carrier accelerating towards its target launches a squadron of 
     fighters, giving maybe a 20-30G boost over the length of the launch 
     tubes (catch your lunch, flyboy). This would have your fighter leaving 
     the carrier at maybe 500m/s faster than the carrier itself (somebody 
     check my calculations, please!). The carrier can then peel off and 
     withdraw to a safe distance, leaving the relatively \'disposable\' 
     fighters to hit the enemy capital ships. 
 <snip>

   Nice idea, but it needs work.

   The problem is \'only\' 500m/s faster than the mothership would not be
significant in game terms of 30,000 km per hex.   A speed change of 16,667
m/s is needed to alter you velocity by one hex. (or range band)  I got that
figure by dividing the distance of 30,000,000 meters (one hex or range band)
by a game turn (1/2 hour or 1800 seconds).
   And, I think I may have found a way to do this....
   I didn\'t use a magnetic mass driver because of the G forces put upon the
pilot (300 plus G\'s) would kill them.
   Instead, I used artifical gravity tractors  <tractors / repulsors are is
FF&S chapter 6 Defensive Systems>.  A gravity field would accellerate all
parts of an object equally, so no G forces would be felt by any parts of the
object.   No G stress,  neat , huh...

   Mount the tractors around the opening at one end of the launch tube.
Insert object at the other end and the tractors start pulling it towards
them.   Accelleration continues, (except for the last 100 meter or so of the
launch tube where the tractors are appliying course correcting pulls to
prevent the now very very fast object from hitting the sides of the launch
tube), untill the missile emerges from the launch tube.   If you have
repulsors, you may now start pushing away the object giving it more speed.
   The formula for speed is accelleration muliplied by time.
  < V = A * T >
   Time depends on the lenght of the launch tube and the accelleration
applied. (the more accelleration you use, the faster you go.   The faster
you go, the less amount of time your in the launch tube.)  So, there is a
formula to figure out time.   It is  \'Time equals Square Root of ( distance
divided by acceleration )
 < T = Sqrt ( D / A ) >
   So... let us take a 1/2 ton missile, a 1000 meter launch tube, (a hugh
ship with needle configureation to carry it), and plug in some numbers and
see what speed we get....  (we will count only 900 meters of the launch
tube, as we are using the last 100 meters for course corrections)  And lets
use 900 G\'s for acceleration at 9.8 m/s for 1 G.
  T = square root ( 900 / (900*9.8) ) equals 0.135526 seconds (time under
acceleration)
  V = ( 900 * 0.319438 )              equals 287.5 meters per second
  (someone please check my math -- I\'m not sure if I inserted the 9.8 meter
per second for 1 gravity in the right place.  It makes a diferance if its
done before or after the square rooting.  thanks)

  I see that a launch tube lenght of 1000 meters is not enough, but at T.L.
14 tractors with a effective range of 10 kilometers are available.  Of
course you can\'t mount a 10,000 meter long launch tube on any ship, (maybe a
fortress moon or a big space station).   
  How about taking a ring shaped ship (like the \'Lab ship\' only bigger),
mounting the tractors on the inner side of the dounut, and tossing a missile
/ fighter out, grabing it via tractors when it is 10 klicks away, and see
what speeds you get then, accerating it right thru the open middle of the
dounut / ship.   You don\'t need a launch tube for this idea to work, just a
long distance to accellerate in.

  Do you think it would work ???
  Do you think it works well enough to devote the hugh amounts of tonnage /
volume required for the tractors into a design.  And power, this thing would
drink megawatts of power.

Of course, the ship combat rules will need to be written to account for 
differences in agility as well.  In Brilliant Lances, the only 
\'maneuverability\' determinant was acceleration; ships that had higher 
accelerations could devote some of their burns (g-turns) to evasion and 
still have some left over to alter their vector.  Any variations in 
agility (rate of turn, or whatever) between different ships with 
identical acceleration ratings had no effect.

The fix?  In MT, the design rules included allocating energy for agility, 
but it was unclear how this energy was spent, which bugged me.  Sure, 
some of it could be spent overdriving thruster plates, and I imagine that 
such a thing could be done with HEPlaR drives, but this doesn\'t help with 
the (admittedly rare) cases where the ship is being pushed by a thruster 
that doesn\'t require wattage (such as chemical rockets).  The "Starship 
Operator\'s Manual" (also for MT) paid some lip service to internal gyro 
systems that were used to rapidly change a ship\'s orientation, but these 
gyros were not factored in anywhere in the design or combat rules.  
Where, for instance, does the immense damage caused by a free-spinning 
and errant gyroscope come into play?

Anyway, I hate to throw this in now that at least two versions of the 
ship design rules have been finished, but how \'bout this:  Put gyroscopes 
back into the rules which affect a ship\'s agility depending on the amount 
of energy input.  After all, the SOM stated that the gyro used gravitic 
generators which imparted rotational forces on the ship by pushing 
against the spinning gyro mass.  A more agile ship would have a greater 
gyro mass (relative to the ship\'s total mass) than a less agile ship, and 
would have more power allocated to running it.  Especially on thruster 
ships, this would serve to offset the advantage over ships requiring 
reaction mass, such as those using HEPlaR drives.  The dangers of gyro 
systems would be, of course, the potential damage caused by a 
free-spinning mass tearing its way through the ship, and the potential 
loss of maneuverability caused by gyro failure, especially if the gyro 
itself had to be ejected from the ship to prevent internal damage.

Naturally, large ships would also require greater internal bracing to 
withstand the stresses caused by sudden rotational forces.  I also 
suspect, although I don\'t have the required texts/formulae handy, that 
there would be some sort of diminishing return as ships got larger, so 
that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to build large ships as 
agile as smaller ones.  Of course, a little gravitic handwaving would 
also accomplish this.

Is this food for thought, or did I just confuse the issue even more?

        How does this hit you: have a launch *RING* running around the
circumference of the ship, sort of like a cyclotron?  The tractors are
placed around the circumference of the ring so that they pull the fighter
around the inside of the ring.  You start the fighter doing revolutions
until it\'s up to some real speed, and then the last tractor (or gravitic
thingamaboohickey) doesn\'t pull, letting the fighter fly out a carefully
located hole in the side of the ring...

        For a really funky variant, you could have multiple fighters spaced
equidistantly around the ring; you just spin them up to speed and then let
them rip all at the same time.  Of course, this would just multiply the
chaos if something went wrong >:).

        This might get around the launch tube length problem.  Of course,
I\'d imagine that as speeds increased the amount of energy needed to keep the
fighter orbiting inside the ring would increase dramatically (dammit Jim I\'m
a law student not a physicist somebody do the math for me...).  This would
hopefully prevent people from dropping their dirty laundry into the launch
ring, spinning it up to .1 C, and demolishing planets with it :).

        Ssshhh... some of my potential players might hear you :).  Actually,
I think that I\'ve decided to go ahead on this one.  I\'ve got some time off
coming up, and might just spend a while working on it while our regularly
scheduled Traveller mayhem occurs.  It might make for a fun counterspin on
the space theme once Ross has us all thoroughly terrorized into catatonia :).

I believe they also based the numbers on lab results with animals
which may not be applicable to humans (something about particle
size and how much the human body will actually retain).

I think there used to be a scientist that had a long-standing
offer to drink a beaker-full of a plutonium solution if anyone
else would drink an equal amount of caffiene. As far as I know
there were never any takers.

JULY 1946 

"Radio transmission between two points on the earth after
reflection from the moon may enter the realm of practicality,
now that it has been demonstrated by radar that the space
surrounding the earth is not impassable to radio waves. If an
ultra-high-frequency pulse was beamed at the moon from
an antenna, the receiver could be located at any place on
earth where the moon could be \'seen\' at the same time as at
the transmitter. Hence, the blocking action of the earth\'s
curvature to high-frequency line-of-sight transmission would
be eliminated, and nation-wide television broadcasts from a
central station might become practical."

   Of course we went on to develop artificial satellites that can do the
same thing, but this has interesting implications.  A TL 5-6 culture could
have world-wide video communications system which relies upon the
signal bounce provided by one or more moons.

        "Gyros" (or as I know them, Reaction Wheel Assemblies -- I\'ve been
through two simulator rides already where our RWAs started overspeeding)
don\'t make sense in Traveller. You\'re not worried about fuel, so just use
your attitude control thrusters. And you ARE going to have to have ACS.

        We use RWAs on Milstar and other three-axis stabilized satellites
because our fuel is obviously a very limiting factor, as for any satellite.
You can use an RWA to keep a vehicle pointed stably, or to change the
orientation. But since your attitude changes are generally NOT going to be
perfectly symmetrical (i.e. change 5* one way, then change exactly 5* back
later), you\'re going to wind up with residual momentum on the RWA -- in
other words, you\'ll eventually get a very high speed built up on it. Then
you have to "desaturate" it, which means you fire ACS such that you can
counteract the momentum as you brake the wheel back down. What it does gain
you is that you only have to counteract the _residual_ momentum -- if you
turn 5* about +X, 6* -X, then 4* +X, then 4* -X, you only have to burn fuel
for 1* instead of 19*.

        So you\'ve got to fire thrusters anyway, and those thrusters can
probably spin you faster than you can spin up/spin down an RWA. Gyros don\'t
make sense, and they didn\'t last more than 5 seconds in my version of
Starship Operators Manual (there\'s still a yellow sticky with words to the
effect of "BS" in it).

I\'m using something called "tactical movement" for this.  Regular movement
is walking along normally, tactical is carefully moving, watching,
listening, and tracking your barrel with your eyes.

ACQ will use a Face-off Bid.  Whenever two parties come into sudden contact,
both can use as many APs as they want from their pool to get the first shot
off.  Make sure to leave one or two to fire the weapon!  Remaining
motionless and covering a specific area would give +5 "free" points towards
first shot in the covered area.  (i.e., "I\'m kneeling behind the barrel and
watching the corridor to engineering").  Tactical movement grants a +3.  If
you can\'t see you opponent, BTW, you can\'t bid!

My early thoughts on supressive fire come from Twilight: 2000.  The
person(s) doing the fire desiginate how many rounds will be fired into the
danger zone.  Anyone passing into that area is attacked, at a *low* to-hit
number, by half the rounds used.

I\'m basing the games on my own experiences, from the Army, to paintball, to
(believe it or not) playing Doom.

Somebody asked how APs are generated.  Answer:  Average of INT and DEX.
There are modifiers for being on active duty, and Tactics Skill gives an
equal number of APs.  Elite troops also get a bonus.  

Note:  This is why the Imperial Marines are NOT TO BE MESSED WITH.  The
average ImpMar starts with 9 AP.  +3 for active duty, +2 for elite force.
They have, on average, twice as many AP as civilians do!

>  Make people predeclare their AP usage before following up. eg: "I\'m
>firing a burst and ducking behind the barrel" 

Starting from the lowest total AP character on up, each player expends
his/her APs.  If another character is in posistion to hinder the first, he
can interrupt.  Also, if you have AP remaining at the end of your phase, you
can use them at any time for the rest of the turn.

   A finance group or network of banks with reciprical aggreements to
facilitate background checks, information validation (are you on the trade
routes you said you would be in the loan app.), and tracking / repo
operations.  To foster a climate favoring economic growth, the imperium
provide facilities, clearing houses of information, (data banks), training
and licencing of investigators, etc...
   All of these groups, institutions, and individuals involved would tend to
support the status quo.   The Imperium is their bread, butter, and
livelyhood. (except maybe the repo end of the industry, some scum get there
foot/tentical/psodopod in the door by being good at that sort of work.)
Anyway, this bunch of conservitives would react badly to antisocial /

to just trust them... please....   
   And, a J-6 ship is so-much more expensive than a J1 or J2 ship.   Your
background had best be squeky clean, even if you do have a solid business
plan that shows you can make the bank payments.
   After you find >> Fred\'s community bank on Australia << willing to make a
loan, you go thru the entire mess again for the inssurer of the ship/loan
package.

   There is not some central committee that says yes to this loan and no to
that one.
   Instead, think of it as \'peer pressure\' on the intersteller scale.

   Unlike in the Solomani Rim, where the loan officer had better get SolSec
approval.

   I agree, economic pressure will keep most of the rift-raft scum down.  It
is that small percentage of rift-raft scum with a large enough down payment,
and that wild gleem in their eye blinding them to economic reality,  that
must be held in check.

It was a long time ago, and many parsecs away... and now there is no proof.
And the loan has already gone thru and construction started.  Your thinking
that if they start pulling jobs with that ship, and you become identifyed as

yourself.  NO... NO... NO... There must be some way to siderail this deal....

The collection "Prelude to Space" has a *lot* of good stuff. "Island in
the Sky" is ok, and easier to find. Basicly, *any* Clarke copyrighted
before the mid 60s will have the right "flavor", as will much of the
stuff written later.

Not necessarily. The big difference is that back then they were
extrapolating the figures in one way, and using a standard of
"reasonably safe". Now we project the damage from low level exposure
slightly differently (though recent studies seem to indicate that the
*old* way is closer to reality!) and the standard attempts to be
"absolutely safe".

Most nuclear designs use shadow sheilding, rather than full shielding.
This mean that you use the same thickness of sheilding, but only in
areas between the crew and the reactor. Why sheild the *sides* of the
ship, if there\'s nothing you can do back there anyway?

Nope, you use hydrogen as reaction mass, because it gives the best
specific impulse, due to the lower molecular weight. Check out the
NERVA program. That produced a workable rocket motor using a graphite
core reactor and liquid hydrogen as fuel. And the design wasn\'t that
different from the 50s designs for such.

You do get a most interesting "afterburner" effect in the lower
atmosphere as the superheated hydrogen gas in the exhaust reacts with
the oxygen in the air. It doesn\'t provide any extra thrust, but it does
make for a spectacular flame.

With a little work, you could probably make a version that could handle
things like ammonia, water, and methane. Only problem is that the
nozzle shape would have to be a compromise, and thus it wouldn\'t be
near as efficient as a motor designed exclusively for any one of them.
But the flexibility would be useful in the outer system.

Eric, Jo, or anyone else who games with me should not read this message, 
it will ruin the next campaign for you. Skip over it!  The 
non-descriptive title is there on purpose so as not to 
give anything away!
*******************

Hi all.   

(Eric, I know you\'re reading this!  I said skip over it!  :-)

So I was staying at this hotel in St. Louis (The Adam\'s Mark, 
it sucks, avoid it at all costs) and had time to re-read Ringworld for the 
third or fourth time.  This inspired an idea for a slightly more 
modest ringworld concept with some new twists.  It is a sort of 
combination Ringworld and Wellworld.  

While I love Niven\'s books, there have always been a few things which
bothered me about the Ringworld.  One is the relative homogeneity of the
ring\'s environment.  Gravity and atmosphere are the same just about
everywhere (except on the "world maps" IIRC), lighting is the same, day
length is the same, and so on. So I thought:  why not make a combination
ringworld and wellworld, with all sorts of different planetary
environments included on the surface?  Here are some of my ideas on making
a more multi-environment ringworld, open to comment, correction and
criticism. 

Gravity:
	To make a ringworld with different gravity in different areas, you
simply spin the thing for .5 g rather than 1 g and increase/decrease the
pull with grav generators where needed.  .5 g is enough to hold down
molecular oxygen and nitrogen (according to AD2300, anyway) in the event
of a grav generator failure and would eliminate the dyson-sphere problem
of having people float up into the sun during a blackout :-).  This also
leads to a slower rate of spin for the ringworld and thus less stress on
its structure.  Niven\'s ringworld with a radius of 150 Mkm spun at about
770 miles/second to produce 1 g. Because the stresses involved are so
huge, Niven had to invent a fictional material (Scrith) as the foundation
of the ringworld.  I\'m pretty sure the stresses would still be high enough
at .5 g to necessitate a "non-normal" building material, (any
engineering types want to work out a ball-park figure?) but at least it\'s 
less of a stretch.  Perhaps Coherent Bonded Super Dense would be enough?  
Would it help if you could make the ringworld thicker than Niven\'s 1 km 
figure?

Atmosphere:
	With variable gravity comes variable atmosphere.  You can have 
oxy/nitro in one place, amonnia in another, and so on.  The only 
difficulty is that atmospheres which won\'t hold together under .5 g are 
going to get shafted in the event of a lengthy grav generator failure.  
One might consider roofing these areas over with some sort of transparent 
material.  You\'d also have to wall areas off from one another, of course.

Temperature, Lighting, Seasons and Day length:
	One way to modify these things is to have an inner ring (the
shadow ring?) that acts as a variable filter (ie., instead of Niven\'s
constant shadow squares).  To modify temperature for a given area of the
ringworld, increase or decrease the shadow ring\'s opacity over it.  If the
central star has a pretty powerful broadband emmision profile (A white
main sequence star?  A white dwarf with a really small ringworld around
it?), you could simulate many different star types by filtering out the
appropriate wavelengths.  You might want to make the ringworld with a
relatively small radius.  This would bring the surface closer to the sun,
allowing you to simulate a broader range of absolute lighting intensities
(by filtering to achieve lower values) and would make the ringworld a
slightly less ambitious engineering project (for the same amount of
material it could be thicker, it would spin slower, etc.).
	The variable filter shadow ring also allows different day lengths 
and a more gradual day/night shift.  One thing that bothers me about 
Niven\'s Ringworld is that it\'s always summer there and the sun is always at 
full noon intensity during the day.  This would raise the amount of UV 
reaching plants on the surface far above earth normal.  With the variable 
filter, you could gradually dim the sun for "sunset" and do the reverse 
for "sunrise".  The sun would still always be directly overhead, though.  
I see no way around this without moving the ring relative to the sun on a 
regular basis (a scary prospect).
	Seasons can be also be simulated by slightly dimming and
brightening the sun in appropriate cycles.
	One problem with the shadow ring concept is that a breakdown 
would spell disaster for many environments.  One thing you could do is 
have the shadow ring go to a default setting if no commands are being 
given to it and/or no power is reaching it.  The default setting would be 
optimized to give as many environments as possible as much time as 
possible to effect repairs.  So long as _someone_ on the ring has the 
tech to repair the shadow ring, everyone would be okay.
	Another option would be to roof over the ringworld and have the 
roof act in the same manner as the shadow ring.  This has the advantage 
of holding in atmosphere in the event of a grav generator failure.  Of 
course, you could have both the shadow ring and the roof idea, with one 
backing up the other.
	In terms of temperature modification, another option would be to 
have radiating fins on the outer surface of the ring under different 
areas.  A hot area would have no fins, thus retaining as much heat as 
possible, while a cold area would have large fins to get rid of excess 
heat.  One could even simulate seasons with variable geometry fins.
Niven used fins to make the oceans of his Ringworld cooler, IIRC.
	
	So basically that\'s the idea.  You have a ringworld with many 
thousands of different worlds simulated, a la Wellworld, and potentially 
many thousands of different races living on it.  You could even have 
some outer-world dwellers live on the outer surface of the ring (I\'m 
thinking of Niven\'s Outsiders).  It would be a really mondo gaming 
environment.

	Well, that\'s it from me.  I welcome all feedback...
 
	Oh, and one more thing (How Columbo-esque!): could someone please
explain to me the spill mountains introduced in the Ringworld Engineers? 
I\'m not sure I understood why they\'re necessary (something about the
Ringworld being unstable). 

Happy Travelling,
Charles.

The fusion ramjets mounted on the rim walls were necessary  
because the Ringworld is unstable; essentially, they\'re orbital  
adjustment thrusters for the Ringworld.  The problem developed  
because the City Builders dismounted so many of them for their  
STL ships... 
 
The spill mountains were part of the recirculation system for 
the oceans.  Sediment from the bottom of the big oceans was 
pumped back up to the rim walls and discharged, forming the 
spill mountains.  Otherwise, after a while, all the Ringworld 
terrain would have eroded into the oceans and stayed there...

Sure, when you can afford it, when you can get it, when you can

I seem to recall that there was another competing design that was never
built, codenamed DUMBO, that used a micro-hole layout in the core as..I
think..an energy exchanger.  The DUMBO design would have produced much higher
thrust to weight with less of radiation problem. Its problem was that nobody
had ever built anything like it, and NASA/DOD didn\'t want to risk it when
they *knew* NERVA would work.

I\'ve wondered about that.  The nozzle doesn\'t *have* to be fixed, does it? 
Can\'t it be designed to conform to variable geometries? I\'m fuzzy today, but
don\'t the MSE\'s already vary nozzle geometries during assent?

Q. You been away from the industry for quite sometime. Can you tell us
where you have been and what you have been doing? Or were you abducted by
Ancients ;-).

A. Between 1988 and 1991, I was executive vice president of Game
Designers\' Workshop, Inc, which meant that I had day-to-day managerial
responsibility for the company, and I did not do large amounts of design.
I left GDW in 1991 and pursued a variety of activities: in the real world,
I sold insurance for four years, which I believe gave me valuable
experience and a grounding in non-game business operations. I work in
partnership with my wife Darlene in Heartland Publishing Services... that
company provides printing and publishing consulting services to game
companies (both established and start-up) in print and in marketing
activities. I designed several computer games and published a collectible
card game.

Q. What computer games did you design?

A. I worked on MegaTraveller, MegaTraveller II, and Twilight: 2000 (from
Paragon/Microprose) and on Challenge of the Five Realms (also Paragon/
Microprose). In each case, I was writing the basic story/scenario and then
looking over their shoulder as they programmed and implemented what I
provided. It\'s amazing how it changes in light of what is possible and under
time pressure.

Q. Can you tell us of your background in the gaming industry?

A. I started in gaming in 1967 in college when, as a political science
minor, I worked with political science role-playing and simulation games
at the University of Illinois. In 1972, after leaving the Army, I attended
Illinois State University, where I hooked up with Frank Chadwick, Rich
Banner, and Loren Wiseman in the establishment of SimRAD (Simulation
Research Analysis and Design), a project at the university dedicated to
producing educational simulations for classroom use. I produced a variety
of custom simulations (on politics, economics, and history) between 1972
and 1974. In 1973, the four of us also established Game Designers\'
Workshop.

Q. Are you going to use ideas and rules based on Classic Traveller for
the new Traveller game? Or are you looking to overhaul the entire system?
Or start from scratch?

A. My statement on T4 has been that it will be based on Classic Traveller
in light of 20 years of role-playing experience. By that I mean, the rules
will be upgraded to include a task system, new character career types, and
other details. I have seen the final basic rules set (which is now at the
printers) which will release at GenCon (keep your fingers crossed).

Q. There have been all kinds of rumors on the direction that you will take
the new Traveller. Can you enlighten us on the direction and theme(s),
that you currently have in mind?

A. I think the proof will be in the game book at GenCon.

Q. There will be quite a few of us,that will not be at GenCon. Can you
elaborate?

A. We have reduced the broad number of character / career types a double
handfull. The new ones of note are: Agents, Scholars, and Entertainers. I
think entertainer has great potential... as a talented person, you are
travelling to the stars performing you speciality in order to survive, and
having adventures along the way.

The task system (in its latest incarnation tanks to Lester Smith) continues
our effort to make Traveller able to handle any situation.


Q. For the people not acquainted with Traveller product line, can you give
us some of the background of the game and changes it has seen?

A. The original Traveller science-fiction game rules were published in
1977 as three 5.5 by 8.5 inch books in a distinctive black cover
highlighted with a characteristic red stripe. Book 1 detailed the creation
of characters and resolution of personal combat. Book 2 dealt with
starships (including interstellar travel, starship design and
construction, and starship combat). Book 3 included a system for
describing worlds and how to adventure on them.

   This original edition (now called Classic Traveller) was envisioned as
generic or universal game system in which any situation or adventure could be
player out. Each individual referee was expected to create and administer his
or her own adventures. Its innovative rules introduced the concept of skills
for characters and detailed random generation tables for characters, animals,
and worlds.

   The game was an immediate success, filling the as yet unfilled need for
science-fiction (and more sophisticated) equivalent to the fantasy oriented
Dungeons & Dragons. For more than a year, the three black books in a box were
the only items in game system. But player response during that period
demanded additional game support in the form of additional rules, and in an
expanded, more specific background against which to play.

   For expanded rules, Game Designers\' Workshop began a tradition of
issuing additional Books numbered in series with the first three.
Mercenary (Book 4; by Frank Chadwick) appeared in 1978 and detailed
military characters and operations. High Guard (Book 5) appeared in 1979
and detailed naval characters and space combat. Scouts (Book 6) appeared
in 1983 and detailed interstellar scout characters and star system and
world generation. Merchant Prince (Book 7) appeared in 1985 and detailed
merchant characters and an expanded trade and commerce system. Robots
(Book 8; by Joe Fugate and Gary Thomas) appeared in 1986 and dealt with
robots and their place in the universe.

   For a more specific background, Game Designers\' Workshop began a
concerted effort to publish materials which defined the interstellar
society of the future. In more than 60 additional volumes, extensive
details of the vast Third Imperium were revealed to followers of the
Traveller game system. This milieu of the Late Imperium became the
foundation of the Traveller universe.

   At the same time players and referees wanted to publish their own
materials, and a series of licensed materials were authorized. Judges
Guild, Digest Group, and Seeker produced numbers of materials. It is
interesting to note that FASA began its existence as a Traveller licensee.

MegaTraveller:

   In 1987, the Traveller game system was revised to consolidate the
materials of the past ten years and in the process, it became a more
detailed and somewhat more complex game system. To its credit and at its
core, it introduced a task system capable of resolving a wide range of
situations.
   
   MegaTraveller also introduced violent change in the Traveller universe
by advancing the background of the game one step into the future. The new
edition introduced the Rebellion Milieu, which chronicled the assassination
of the Emperor who ruled the Third Imperium and the deterioration of the
empire into a number of competing states embroiled in rebellion and civil
war. 

Traveller: The New Era:

In 1992, Game Designers\' Workshop determined that all of its role-playing
game rules systems should be consolidated under what was called the house
rules system, which was essentially the rules set for Twilight: 2000. An
extensive re-write of the game system by Dave Nilsen produced Traveller:
The New Era, which again advanced the background one step into the future:
into the increasingly chaotic aftermath of the Rebellion called the Virus
Era. Although the game won the Origins Award for best role-playing game
and has devoted followers, it also introduced another level of complexity
to the system.

	I know that a lot of people were very excited when they heard 
that MM&co. planned on releasing T4 so soon after the demise of GDW, but 
I was not among them.  I think Traveller could have done with a period of 
reflection after the back-to-back commerical failures of MT & TNE.  I 
think that it would have been a wise investment to do some real market 
research and find out who buys RPGs and who among them might be persuaded 
to buy Traveller.  
	A lot of people have criticized TNE as being "T:2000 in space,"
but T:2000 appears to have been GDWs most successful product, so it is not
surprising that they thought that was their market.  For all that,
TNE was a very high quality product.  It combined an exciting and detailed
setting with the "sex appeal" of SAG raids, Vampires, Star Vikings, and so
on which might appeal to younger players. I personally liked the RC 
setting a great deal and thought it provided a nicely contained setting 
and atmosphere, particularly for new refs.  But TNE still was not enough 
to keep GDW afloat.
	A look at the history of GDW shows a whole series of great ideas, 
few of which were successful.  2300AD was an excellent setting and had 
some of the best hard SF background and aliens ever.  Space: 1889 was the 
most original RPG setting to come out in a decade and faced no 
competition in its niche.  Dark Conspiracy\'s only failing seems to have 
been that it was ahead of its time.  With the runaway popularity of the 
X-files, one can\'t help but wonder how such a game could possibly fail.
	And yet all these games _did_ fail.  Why?  More importantly, why
will T4 be any different?  As the above list shows, it is not enough to
have a good idea, the idea has to sell games.  By the fact that T4 is
being marketed as "Marc Miller\'s Traveller" and as a return to CT "updated
with 20 years of roleplaying experience," I get the impression that the
folks at Imperium Games are banking on all of us old die-hards to be the
market for yet another version of Traveller.  After all, who but a
die-hard would even know who Marc Miller is, let alone care if his name is
on the product?  I sincerely hope that the folks at Imperium Games have
this one figured out, because one way or another, there _won\'t_ be a T5. 

- --Muir

P.S.  This is not an attempt to ressurect the "TNE killed GDW, did not, 
did too," thread, I\'m merely reflecting on the business side of our hobby.

reading in the New York Times today about the new "aerospike" motor that\'s
been selected as the design for the next-generation launch vehicle prototype
the X-33.  As I understand it, the aerospike uses banks of small exhaust
ducts called something like combustors arranged along the base of an inverted
cone.  The exhaust is thus "contained" only on the side that contacts the
inverted cone.  Apparently, this design works better than a standard "bell"
nozzle, which when optimized for various altitudes and pressures don\'t work
as well at others.

I just mention this because I think it\'s interesting, and because I\'m not
sure I understand it, exactly.  What are the design considerations that
affect how you build a bell nozzle, and what is this aerospike engine doing
that avoids these difficulties.  Can someone explain it so that a social
science grad student can understand it?  (note that I didn\'t _say_ idiot, but
maybe I didn\'t need to ;)).

Oh, man.  For those of you who are trying to puzzle this out, but have
probably already guessed:

The left diamond is blue.  The top diamond is red.  The right diamond is
yellow.  The bottom diamond is white.  These are found on buildings, doors,
and storage tanks to let fire-fighters, among others, know just what is 
in the area.  

As I recall, the diamonds signify health hazard, flammability hazard, and
reactivity hazard respectively.  In other words, "will exposure harm me",
"will it start on fire", and "might it react explosively".  Four indicates 
maximal hazard.  The white diamond is used for special warning symbols; 
radiation hazard, -W- "use no water", COR "corrosive", and so on.

This designates a deadly health hazard that has a very low flash point and
that\'s unstable enough that it might detonate if the moons are in the 
wrong phases. 

Characters who operate starships involved in trading should be able to read
this stuff -- heck, their LHyd tanks are probably marked with it or the
Imperial equivalent.

final stages of bug swatting. The program has the following capabilities:

a) Subsector Generation. Entire subsectors can be created in just a few
seconds. It sure beats the heck out of a full day\'s worth of dice rolling! :)

b) Load/Save/Edit. All aspects of the subsector can be edited, and you can save
and load them.

c) Printing. Print out both the subsector map and the planet lists in full
Traveller: The New Era format.

d) Collapsing. Collapse a planet or a whole subsector.

If anyone thinks that GDW would have a legal problem with this program, please
let me know. :) I don\'t feel like getting sued.

Nutema\'s claim to fame in the Spinward States is as an exporter of
meats and meat products that are without equal on any known Spinward
planet.  Everyone knows of dragon steaks by reputation, and many are
lucky enough to have had the opportunity to eat some in a luxury
restaurant.

The traveller to Nutema will notice a significant difference between
Nutema and the nearby worlds as soon as he debarks from his ship.
Starports on planets that have direct commerce with Nutema are all
strongly influenced by Vilani and Sylean attitudes.  They tend to be
orderly places, with a clear demarcation between administration,
security, and service personnel.  Not so on Nutema.  Administrators
are likely to be directly interacting with passengers and carrying
bags or teamstering cargo, service personnel shout out orders to each
other with abandon, and there are no security guards anywhere in
sight. That\'s not to say that your arrival will be chaotic.  The
efficiency of the Nuteman system is surprising, and you\'ll be ready
to depart the starport for the planet\'s surface within a standard day
- including processing by CHI (Customs - Health - Immigration).  The
apparent lack of security at Nutema Skyside (the _only_ starport at
Nutema - there are no "dirtside" facilities for starships) is also no
reason for concern - each and every Nuteman you see will be armed (an
effect of Nuteman attitudes toward government, and of the needs of
the ranching industry), and they all know how and when to use their
weapons.

Nuteman Startown is right there in the Starport.  The organized chaos
of the port area extends here as well, with commercial, governmental,
and residential units intermixed in whatever way the various owners
felt was most immediately useful, and people doing whatever needs to
be done whenever it needs doing, without regard for whether they are
the "proper" person to be doing the job.  Note that although the
entire starport is considered to be the extraterritoriality zone,
Nuteman notions of what is right and proper are the ones that are
enforced, not those of the interstellar powers.  The result is a much
more anarchic atmosphere, where the cardinal rules are to look out
for oneself, expect others to do the same, and be careful to avoid
giving offense.  For this reason, travellers are advised to contact
the Imperial Tourism Bureau office before exiting their ship.  This
office has the de facto status of Consulate, but its ability to
intervene on behalf of an offworld citizen is limited.  The office
maintain close contact with personnel based planetside, and the
traveller who remembers to file an itinerary with the Bureau will
find that almost any unexpected problems can be quickly cleared up.
The exception to this is encounters with the legal system, where the
most that can be done by the Bureau is to arrange for competent
Nuteman legal assistance, and "affairs of honor", where the Bureau\'s
ability to act is limited to ensuring appropriate medical attention
and legal assistance, or, in extreme cases, arranging for the
traveller\'s body to be shipped back home, along with timely and
appropriate notifications to next-of-kin and other designated
persons.

Conducting business on Nutema is a matter of "let the buyer beware",
and of contracts where "every piddling detail" is spelled out in
full.  Regardless of the respective addresses of the parties to a
contract on Nutema, disputes over contractual matters are always
settled according to Nuteman protocols, which means plenty of
negotiation and arbitration, optionally assisted by third parties
(for a fee) before it gets to a Nuteman court.  The court will look
only at the language of the contract and the facts of the case;
"intentions" not spelled out in the contract count for as much as the
color of the sky - which is to say, not at all.  That\'s not to say
that Nuteman businessmen are out to fleece the unwary; rather, they
bend over backwards to ensure that any contract is fair to both
parties - doing otherwise is, in general, a sure way to get called
out in an affair of honor.

Beyond that caveat, doing business on Nutema is very much a social
activity.  Count on "working lunches" and "working dinners" in which
little work and much "schmooze" gets done.  Nuteman are willing to
exchange anecdotes about various occasions in their lives at the drop
of a hat; be prepared to do the same - Nuteman businessmen want to
"know who they\'re doing business with", and won\'t be satisfied with
the arm\'s-length relationship common on most worlds.  Also, it is
considered entirely proper on Nutema to address an acquaintance,
either business or social, by his/her first name, or by an unadorned
family name, omitting any titles or honorifics.  Deadlines are less
important than agreement on the essentials; expect that an attempt to
pressure a Nuteman businessman to be counterproductive.

Most business with Nuteman concerns can be conducted at the Starport,
and there are definite advantages to doing so - for example, no taxes
or import/export duties are levied on transactions at the Starport,
and many businesses receive subsidies from profits from berthing
fees, allowing prices on goods and (non-berthing-related) services to
be relatively low.  The down side is that many courtesies that are
provided free of charge at other starports are available only for a
fee at Nutema - shuttle service to the surface is one such.
Nevertheless, you\'ll be encouraged by your Nuteman business contacts
to "c\'mon down and visit", and such a visit is not to be missed.

In spite of the hustle and bustle that you\'ll find at the starport,
and on the planet\'s surface, the pace of life on Nutema is relaxed.
Things get done "when they\'re done", and firm schedules are viewed
almost as an imposition on personal freedom.  You\'ll find that proper
care is taken on all matters, however, and that includes quick
completion of a task when appropriate.

Nutema uses two calendars and two clocks - one of each is
synchronized with the standard Imperial time measurements; the second
calendar is synchronized with the local revolutional periods. The
second clock (the "decimal" clock, in Nuteman terms) is a strictly
Nuteman invention; the Nuteman day is divided into 100 "centads",
each of which is divided into ten "mills". Each "mill" is thus 83
seconds long.  The Starport operates according to the Imperial clock
and calendar, as does the local government in terms of financial
matters and interaction with the Imperium.  Most other matters are
handled on the basis of the local calendar, measured in local days.
Note that a local day, when described using the standard clock,
starts at 0000 (midnight) and ends at 2302 - 2303 is the same as
midnight, and starts the next day.  The decimal clock starts at 000
(midnight) and runs to 999 - one "minute" later, it is 000 again, and
the next day begins.  The distinguishing factor between the clocks is
that decimal time is always written with three digits, while standard
time is always written with four; when speaking, standard time is
always suffixed by "standard" or "hours", and times before 1000 are
always pronounced with a leading "oh" - "oh-six-hundred standard"
refers to six hours after midnight; "six hundred" refers to a time
nearly eight standard hours later (13 standard hours and 50 standard
minutes after midnight).  It is highly recommended that the traveller
become familiar with the decimal clock, although many clocks on the
planet give times in both the decimal form and the standard form.

There is one shuttle port at each of Nutema\'s 82 cities, with both
commercial air-raft (the "bus", in local parlance) and maglev
("train") service from the shuttle port (Class F, universally) to the
nearby smaller towns and larger ranches, and commercial air-raft
("bus") and shuttle service between the shuttle ports.  Most shuttle
ports are also bases for fleets of chauffeured air-rafts ("taxis")
that provide reasonably priced door-to-door service between any two
points within a certain distance from the center of the city, and
generally to other nearby cities as well.  Travellers should note
that the shuttle ports are not considered extraterritorial.

Nuteman cities are compact conglomerations of buildings interspersed
with parks and other recreational open areas.  Zoning, per se,
doesn\'t exist, any more than it does in the Starport, but unspoken
informal agreements have resulted in most heavy industry (meat
processing and manufacturing, mostly) being concentrated, usually a
short distance away from the city proper, and most of the more
raucous forms of commercial enterprise are concentrated in the center
of the city, away from residential concentrations.  While almost any
needs within a city can be met within walking distance, each city is
home to at least one, and most likely several, enterprising
individuals or organizations that provide the visitor - or resident -
with transportation (like "taxis") to more distant parts of the city.

When you visit a Nuteman restaurant, you\'ll be steered toward some of
the more exotic "special of the day" dishes, almost none of which use
dragon meat.  They\'re all good, but if this is your first visit to
Nutema, ask for "a slab, dressed", regardless of whether or not you
see it on the menu - it\'s available, and they\'ll be happy to prepare
it for you.  Even if you\'ve had dragon off-planet, you\'re in for a
treat, and you\'ll realize that you\'ve never really eaten dragon
before.  You\'ll get a slab of dragon, five centimeters thick and
easily twenty centimeters across, either grilled or roasted (your
choice), the latter in its own juices, served with a collection of
native fruits and vegetables.  The particular assortment of fruits
and vegetables varies, depending on the time of year.  Nuteman drink
beer with their dragon, and almost nothing else, but order an
off-world brand if one is available (usually) - by almost any
standards, a native Nuteman beer is as bad as the dragon is good, and
even the Nuteman drink it only to prove that they can.

Dress on Nutema is a matter of practicality, especially given the
climate.  Most of the time, ranch staff will wear a "body sleeve"
(really a space-suit liner) for routine work around the ranch,
getting into combat armor when direct action against one or more
dragon is needed.  In the cities, more attention is paid to "style",
but again, practicality rules - the long, flowing garments frequently
seen among Vilani traditionalists are nowhere to be seen on Nutema;
neither are the ruffs and frills of the various noble courts and
former noble courts.  In general, Nuteman expect their clothes to be
quite comfortable and to stand up to "normal wear and tear" for
whatever job they expect to be doing - generally no more than that,
but certainly nothing less.  This is not to say that wealth isn\'t
displayed when it is possessed - it most certainly is, but never in
forms that don\'t also have a "practical" purpose.  Generally, the
preferred mode of display is to take purely functional forms, and
render them in rare or difficult-to-work materials, or with
workmanship of extremely high quality.  Some examples: One rancher
is reputed to own (and use) a set of eight beer steins - each of
which was cut from a single clear (gem-quality) diamond.  A local
businessman and philanthropist had a four-meter conference table made
out of a single slice cut through a black mallorn (a tree that grows
only on Whenge, in the coreward area of Cronor subsector. When
polished, the wood has the appearance of black glass, with the
annular rings common to large trees.  An as-yet-unexplained optical
effect makes it appear as though the color is below the surface of
the wood).

Organized sports are arguably the most popular form of entertainment
on Nutema, with free rugby (rugby in a zero-g field) and baseball
being the most popular sports.  Most Nuteman can throw, hit, and
catch competently, and a "pick-up" baseball game is almost compulsory
at any large social gathering.  There are "company leagues" all over
the planet, but no professional organizations - the Nuteman feel that
it would spoil the sports.  Other sports are not unknown on Nutema;
generally favored are football ("soccer" in the local dialect) and an
amorphous form of seemingly violent entertainment called "rodeo"
which seems to have no fixed form. Most of Nutema\'s limited habitable
land area (basically the tropical zone around the seas - most
everything outside it is tundra or worse) is devoted to its primary
industry, dragon ranching.  No matter which shuttle port you are
headed for, your shuttle\'s route will be within easy sight of a
dragon ranch. One look at a herd of dragon will explain why Nutema
allows heavy military equipment to be owned and used by private
citizens - it takes a tank and its weapons to make an impression on a
25-tonne beast, and when that beast, or a herd of them, is angry or
confused, and stampeding, not even a tank can hope to do much.  In
order to manage the herds, each of the ranchers maintains enough
manpower and equipment to outfit a crack mercenary unit or three, and
keeps both in top condition.

Nutema has strong cultural institutions as well, all funded entirely
by admission and concession fees, and by private subscription, with
no government subsidies.  Almost every city is home to a symphony
orchestra, and many cities are also home to one or more opera,
theater, or dance companies.  Solomani works from the pre-(Second)
Imperial era (also called the Terran Confederation Era) are generally
favored, but more recent works do not lack for appreciation.  Museums
may also be found on Nutema; two of the most notable are the Stellar
Art Museum, with an extensive collection of art and literature with
space- and star-flight themes (including works with such themes
created before space flight was known on the artist/author\'s world),
and the Museum of the Expansion, noted throughout the Regency for its
unmatched collection of information and artifacts pertaining to the
expansion of stellar societies into the area "behind the claw".

Tourism on Nutema is managed by private organizations seeking to make
a profit.  Package tours can be arranged, or the visitor can hire a
private guide who will tailor a tour to the visitor\'s individual
interests.  Highly recommended are trips to the winter pole area,
where a near-constant auroral display can be seen; a trip to The
Plume, a geyser which erupts twice daily (The attraction is due to
the fact that the water is very definitely colored green, due to a
stratum of copper-bearing minerals that the geyser cuts through); and
Glacier Canyon (in the southern "temperate" zone), a canyon cut by
glaciation, presenting a vista that has been compared with such
legendary canyons such as the Grand, on Terra.  There are other
sights as well, and it is also possible to arrange educational and/or
business tours of many industrial plants and most ranches.

The maintenance of honor effectively mandates honesty and respect
between individuals; dishonesty or disrespect can be (and in the
opinion of most Nuteman, should be) construed as an attack on the
honor of the person lied to or treated with disrespect, and that
person has the right to demand satisfaction, in the form of a duel,
either to blood or death, depending on the perceived severity of the
attack.  A challenge to a duel is not given lightly, and refusal to
accept is tantamount to openly acknowledging that one knowingly
attacked the

Well, for those of you who missed it, GDW
announced it\'s closing down. :(

I for one certainly hope that someone or some
company picks up GDW\'s product lines and keeps
them going. Too bad that it seems to be a tough
time for the industry in general - WoC drops
it\'s RPG line, WW lays off a few of its people
and now GDW goes down. I\'ve even heard some rumors
about SJG cutting back on the GRUPS line.

Well, Roger Sanger picked up the remnants
of DGP, maybe this is a good business
opportunity for someone else to try to
rescue the Traveller line.

This is truly sad news for Traveler fans everywhere.
But this does not have to be the end. I agree with Mr. Hale\'s view that we,
as fans of one of the oldest and IMNSHO the best and most versitile Sci-Fi
gamming systems out there, should do what we can do to keep the flame
burning. The TML is but one way.  I also urge thise people out there to
submit articles to magizines like the Traveller Chronicle.
Together we can Keep the Flame!

(Drat! and just when the RSB was released, now I\'ll never know what this
"Empress Wave" is all about!) :)

So GDW is giving it up. What a damned shame. The hobby will never be
the same. Are we getting old?

In answer to the letters I\'ve already gotten, and the more that I\'m sure
to get: I\'m a fan of both TRAVELLER and SPACE: 1889. I\'ve already told
Loren Wiseman, personally, that I would be interested in talking about
these games. He told me he would pass it on to Frank, and I\'m sure he has.
I have not heard from Frank yet, but I know he has other things on his
mind.

Please don\'t expect a blow-by-blow account, but if and when there\'s
something
to announce, I\'ll let you know. No need to send me any more mail about how
neat it would be; you\'re preaching to the converted :-)

What a releif to hear this.  I can only hope that Marc gets the capital he
needs to revive the Traveller line and put it back in the Number One spot it
so rightly deserves in the RPG market.

As far as ideas/suggestions, I would say that, much as it might please some
folks (including me), its too late to just "erase" the Virus, Collapse and
the Regency/Reformation Coalition.  May of the old-guard Traveller players
felt betrayed when our background went to hell.  I don\'t see how doing the
same thing to the newer Traveller players will make things any better.  My
fondest hope would be a game system that supports multiple backgrounds.
Maybe the fans of the Virus can be kept happy with some kind of setting
sourcebook, and then there could be another set of background sourcebooks
for those of us who ignored the Virus and kept on with the Rebellion and its
aftermath.

My campaign is at 1176 right now, some 38 years after the remnants of
Dulinor\'s fleet fled into the wilderness spinward of the Imperium. and 34
years after a combined Deneb/Vilani fleet conquered Capital and executed
Lucan.  The Imperium remains as a confederation between the Ziru Siirka and
the Domain of Deneb, and this group has reabsorbed most of the central parts
of the Imperium.  The Solomani have absorbed much of the old Imperium
starting one or two sectors  rimward of Core sector, but isolated pockets of
resistance remain.

This is a campaign that has been running continuously since 1983, so I was
not about to change my universe to suit the needs of the Virus.  I like
having at least a semi-intact Imperium to play with.  I was happy enough
with most of the game mechanics changes, but the destruction of the whoel
gaming backgound really irked me.  I did continue to buy GDW products after
the TNE release, and I was surprised at how good some of them were (despite
the Virus silliness).  The last few months saw several GDW releases that
just knocked my socks off, and I thought that maybe GDW has going to pull
out of their long shallow dive, but alas, this was not to be.

I am sorry to see GDW go.  I have enjoyed many of their products (not just
Traveller), and will continue to enjoy them.  I hope Loren, Frank and Dave
come out OK after all of this, and I hope to see more things from them in
the future.  And I hope Marc\'s message presages something many of us here
have hoped for for several years; a rebirth of the Traveller we all loved.

The RICE Paper on NUTEMA seems to have been truncated during its
transmission on the XWeb.  It is entirely possible that this is due
to a heretofore unknown software limitation at the RICE central
offices.  We are therefore retransmitting this document,
partitioning it into two parts.  This is PART 2.  PART 1 will be
transmitted simultaneously with this under the same subject flag.
We apologize for the inconvenience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Organized sports are arguably the most popular form of entertainment
on Nutema, with free rugby (rugby in a zero-g field) and baseball
being the most popular spectator sports, and baseball being the most
popular participatory sport.  Most Nuteman can throw, hit, and catch
competently, and a "pick-up" baseball game is almost compulsory at
any large social gathering.  There are "company leagues" all over the
planet, but no professional baseball organizations - the Nuteman feel
that it would spoil the sport, and the only reason they tolerate
professionals (many of whom are former offworlders with experience)
for free rugby is because of the cost of the zero-g facilities.  Other
sports are not unknown on Nutema; generally favored are football
("soccer" in the local dialect) and an amorphous form of seemingly
violent entertainment called "rodeo" which seems to have no fixed form.
Most of Nutema\'s limited habitable land area (basically the tropical
zone around the seas - most everything outside it is tundra or worse)
is devoted to its primary industry, dragon ranching.  No matter which
shuttle port you are headed for, your shuttle\'s route will be within
easy sight of a dragon ranch. One look at a herd of dragon will explain
why Nutema allows heavy military equipment to be owned and used by
private citizens - it takes a tank and its weapons to make an
impression on a 25-tonne beast, and when that beast, or a herd of them,
is angry or confused, and stampeding, not even a tank can hope to do
much.  In order to manage the herds, each of the ranchers maintains
enough manpower and equipment to outfit a crack mercenary unit or
three, and keeps both in top condition.

The government provides three, and only three, services:  It
maintains the starport and the shuttle ports, it provides command and
coordination for planetary defense (with the ranchers providing the
heavy equipment, and the population at large providing the manpower
and infantry equipment), and it provides criminal and commercial
justice services, including the Nuteman Marshalls, whose sole purpose
is to investigate allegations of criminal acts and bring the accused
to justice - they are not a patrol force in the traditional sense of
a police department.  The basic philosophy of all Nuteman with
respect to crime and justice is that the individual is responsible
for maintaining his honor, and his own safety and that of his
property, and may take any action he deems fit to protect them - but
if in doing so, he becomes a danger to his neighbors, they have the
same right to protect themselves against him.  This extends to
protecting the planet itself, which is why the government does not
maintain a standing army (nor would it be allowed to by the Nuteman -
they take the position that a government that maintains a standing
army has no checks, other than its own ethics, against oppressing its
own people, or aggression against others), and is indirectly why
taxes are absolutely minimal on Nutema (a government that is kept
poor doesn\'t have the money to spend on standing armies - only on
what the people feel they need from the government).

The maintenance of honor effectively mandates honesty and respect
between individuals; dishonesty or disrespect can be (and in the
opinion of most Nuteman, should be) construed as an attack on the
honor of the person lied to or treated with disrespect, and that
person has the right to demand satisfaction, in the form of a duel,
either to blood or death, depending on the perceived severity of the
attack.  A challenge to a duel is not given lightly, and refusal to
accept is tantamount to openly acknowledging that one knowingly
attacked the honor of the challenger.  Duels are always performed in
public, with witnesses; this is a courtesy to the Marshalls to ensure
that any death is in fact identified as an affair of honor.  If the
offense was severe enough to warrant a death challenge in the opinion
of the challenger, refusing to accept the challenge can, and probably
will, cost the refuser his life. One can avoid the necessity of
responding to challenges by wearing an orange-and-black armband
(available at the starport, or at any weapon shop), but this also
marks the wearer as a "second class citizen" who does not feel that
his honor is worth defending.  Such individuals are generally treated
poorly by other Nuteman, but having renounced duelling, or indeed any
"civilized" recourse to infringement of their rights, they have no
real recourse against such treatment.

Except when their honor is offended, the people of Nutema are open
and friendly, and the visitor who interacts with them openly and
honestly will have no trouble acquiring a "friendly native guide" who
will, almost certainly, invite the visitor to a party, or to dinner
with his (the native\'s) family, or to see a branding or butchering
out at a ranch, or to some other form of friendly and informal
entertainment. You\'ll also have no trouble getting your guide\'s
opinions on the best places to eat and the best places to stay - but
be warned, if your guide is one of the ranchers, you\'ll be invited to
stay with him "out at the ranch", and "no" in any form is not an
acceptable answer - unless you take him to meet the friend or
business contact that you\'ve already arranged to stay with.

In order to avoid inadvertent offense, it is advisable for the
prudent traveller to be aware of certain basic philosophical
decisions that the Nuteman have made with respect to governance, and
the effect on the society that those decisions have had.  Attention
has previously been drawn to the custom of duelling, and the
perceptions of personal honor behind it.  Defense of property and
personal liberty is taken at least as seriously as defense of honor;
a Nuteman will not hesitate to take strong, decisive action in the
event that he believes that his property is being stolen or damaged;
nor will he hesitate to act against anyone who attempts to restrict
his "essential liberty" (which is generally taken to mean that a
person can not be prevented from doing as he pleases, save that any
such actions may not interfere with the similar right of another).
It is for this reason, as well as for the defense of honor, that all
Nuteman go armed, and there is a general belief that a person who is
not armed is one who is not willing to defend his "essential liberty"
or honor, and is not therefore worthy of being treated with the
normal courtesies.  The visitor to Nutema is advised to get some
rudimentary training in armed self-defense (if he/she does not
already have such knowledge), and to purchase a weapon, before
descending to the planet\'s surface; both may be obtained in startown.
In addition, each shuttle port, and most towns, have at least one, and
usually several, weapon shops where the citizen or visitor may purchase
weapons or have weapons checked, cleaned, and repaired.

An interesting effect of the minimalist philosophy with respect to
government, plus the strong respect for individual liberty, has led
to a governmental organization that would appear, at first glance, to
be so totally unwieldy as to be ineffective at anything.  The basic
assumption seems to be that any government with sufficient power
unchecked will become oppressive relative to those it governs.  As a
result, the government is divided against itself, with each branch
having powers over the other two.  In addition, as perhaps the
ultimate check on the powers of government, there is a power vested
not in any official of the government, but individually in the people
of the planet:  The people may respond to perceived excesses by most
government officials in the same manner as they would respond to any
offense against their "essential liberties" or their honor. Also, the
only check on this power is that the person so acting may only be
convicted of an illegal action if the effect of the action on the
government official is "in nature excess of what response such
official was deserving of".  It is instructive to note that death is
not normally considered by the courts to be an excessive response to
proposals to impose general and broad taxes or licensing fees.

Nutema\'s claim to fame in the Spinward States is as an exporter of
meats and meat products that are without equal on any known Spinward
planet.  Everyone knows of dragon steaks by reputation, and many are
lucky enough to have had the opportunity to eat some in a luxury
restaurant.

The traveller to Nutema will notice a significant difference between
Nutema and the nearby worlds as soon as he debarks from his ship.
Starports on planets that have direct commerce with Nutema are all
strongly influenced by Vilani and Sylean attitudes.  They tend to be
orderly places, with a clear demarcation between administration,
security, and service personnel.  Not so on Nutema.  Administrators are
likely to be directly interacting with passengers and carrying bags or
teamstering cargo, service personnel shout out orders to each other
with abandon, and there are no security guards anywhere in sight.
That\'s not to say that your arrival will be chaotic.  The efficiency of
the Nuteman system is surprising, and you\'ll be ready to depart the
starport for the planet\'s surface within a standard day - including
processing by CHI (Customs - Health - Immigration).  The apparent lack
of security at Nutema Skyside (the _only_ starport at Nutema - there
are no "dirtside" facilities for starships) is also no reason for
concern - each and every Nuteman you see will be armed (an effect of
Nuteman attitudes toward government, and of the needs of the ranching
industry), and they all know how and when to use their weapons.

Nuteman Startown is right there in the Starport.  The organized chaos
of the port area extends here as well, with commercial, governmental,
and residential units intermixed in whatever way the various owners
felt was most immediately useful, and people doing whatever needs to
be done whenever it needs doing, without regard for whether they are
the "proper" person to be doing the job.  Note that although the
entire starport is considered to be the extraterritoriality zone,
Nuteman notions of what is right and proper are the ones that are
enforced, not those of the interstellar powers.  The result is a much
more anarchic atmosphere, where the cardinal rules are to look out
for oneself, expect others to do the same, and be careful to avoid
giving offense.  For this reason, travellers are advised to contact the
Imperial Tourism Bureau office before exiting their ship.  This office
has the de facto status of Consulate, but its ability to intervene on
behalf of an offworld citizen is limited.  The office maintain close
contact with personnel based planetside, and the traveller who
remembers to file an itinerary with the Bureau will find that almost
any unexpected problems can be quickly cleared up.  The exception to
this is encounters with the legal system, where the most that can be
done by the Bureau is to arrange for competent Nuteman legal
assistance, and "affairs of honor", where the Bureau\'s ability to act
is limited to ensuring appropriate medical attention and legal
assistance, or, in extreme cases, arranging for the traveller\'s body to
be shipped back home, along with timely and appropriate notifications
to next-of-kin and other designated persons.

Conducting business on Nutema is a matter of "let the buyer beware",
and of contracts where "every piddling detail" is spelled out in
full.  Regardless of the respective addresses of the parties to a
contract on Nutema, disputes over contractual matters are always
settled according to Nuteman protocols, which means plenty of
negotiation and arbitration, optionally assisted by third parties
(for a fee) before it gets to a Nuteman court.  The court will look
only at the language of the contract and the facts of the case;
"intentions" not spelled out in the contract count for as much as the
color of the sky - which is to say, not at all.  That\'s not to say
that Nuteman businessmen are out to fleece the unwary; rather, they
bend over backwards to ensure that any contract is fair to both
parties - doing otherwise is, in general, a sure way to get called
out in an affair of honor.

Beyond that caveat, doing business on Nutema is very much a social
activity.  Count on "working lunches" and "working dinners" in which
little work and much "schmooze" gets done.  Nuteman are willing to
exchange anecdotes about various occasions in their lives at the drop
of a hat; be prepared to do the same - Nuteman businessmen want to
"know who they\'re doing business with", and won\'t be satisfied with
the arm\'s-length relationship common on most worlds.  Also, it is
considered entirely proper on Nutema to address an acquaintance,
either business or social, by his/her first name, or by an unadorned
family name, omitting any titles or honorifics.  Deadlines are less
important than agreement on the essentials; expect that an attempt to
pressure a Nuteman businessman to be counterproductive.

Most business with Nuteman concerns can be conducted at the Starport,
and there are definite advantages to doing so - for example, no taxes
or import/export duties are levied on transactions at the Starport,
and many businesses receive subsidies from profits from berthing
fees, allowing prices on goods and (non-berthing-related) services to
be relatively low.  The down side is that many courtesies that are
provided free of charge at other starports are available only for a
fee at Nutema - shuttle service to the surface is one such.
Nevertheless, you\'ll be encouraged by your Nuteman business contacts
to "c\'mon down and visit", and such a visit is not to be missed.

In spite of the hustle and bustle that you\'ll find at the starport,
and on the planet\'s surface, the pace of life on Nutema is relaxed.
Things get done "when they\'re done", and firm schedules are viewed
almost as an imposition on personal freedom.  You\'ll find that proper
care is taken on all matters, however, and that includes quick
completion of a task when appropriate.

Nutema uses two calendars and two clocks - one of each is synchronized
with the standard Imperial time measurements; the second calendar is
synchronized with the local revolutional periods. The second clock (the
"decimal" clock, in Nuteman terms) is a strictly Nuteman invention; the
Nuteman day is divided into 100 "centads", each of which is divided
into ten "mills". Each "mill" is thus 83 seconds long.  The Starport
operates according to the Imperial clock and calendar, as does the
local government in terms of financial matters and interaction with the
Imperium.  Most other matters are handled on the basis of the local
calendar, measured in local days.  Note that a local day, when
described using the standard clock, starts at 0000 (midnight) and ends
at 2302 - 2303 is the same as midnight, and starts the next day.  The
decimal clock starts at 000 (midnight) and runs to 999 - one minute
later, it is 000 again, and the next day begins.  The distinguishing
factor between the clocks is that decimal time is always written with
three digits, while standard time is always written with four; when
speaking, standard time is always suffixed by "standard" or "hours",
and times before 1000 are always pronounced with a leading "oh" -
"oh-six-hundred standard" refers to six hours after midnight; "six
hundred" refers to a time nearly eight standard hours later (13
standard hours and 50 standard minutes after midnight).  It is highly
recommended that the traveller become familiar with the decimal clock,
although many clocks on the planet give times in both the decimal form
and the standard form.

There is one shuttle port at each of Nutema\'s 82 cities, with
commercial air-raft (the "bus", in local parlance) or maglev service
from the shuttle port (Class F, universally) to the nearby smaller
towns and larger ranches, and commercial air-raft ("bus") and shuttle
service between the shuttle ports.  Most shuttle ports are also bases
for fleets of chauffeured air-rafts ("taxis") that provide reasonably
priced door-to-door service between any two points within a certain
distance from the center of the city, and generally to other nearby
cities as well. Travellers should note that the shuttle ports are not
considered extraterritorial.

Nuteman cities are compact conglomerations of buildings interspersed
with parks and other recreational open areas.  Zoning, per se,
doesn\'t exist, any more than it does in the Starport, but unspoken
informal agreements have resulted in most heavy industry (meat
processing and manufacturing, mostly) being concentrated, usually a
short distance away from the city proper, and most of the more
raucous forms of commercial enterprise are concentrated in the center
of the city, away from residential concentrations.  While almost any
needs within a city can be met within walking distance, each city is
home to at least one, and most likely several, enterprising
individuals or organizations that provide the visitor - or resident -
with transportation (like "taxis") to more distant parts of the city.

When you visit a Nuteman restaurant, you\'ll be steered toward some of
the more exotic "special of the day" dishes, almost none of which use
dragon meat.  They\'re all good, but if this is your first visit to
Nutema, ask for "a slab, dressed", regardless of whether or not you
see it on the menu - it\'s available, and they\'ll be happy to prepare
it for you.  Even if you\'ve had dragon off-planet, you\'re in for a
treat, and you\'ll realize that you\'ve never really eaten dragon
before.  You\'ll get a slab of dragon, five centimeters thick and
easily twenty centimeters across, either grilled or roasted (your
choice), the latter in its own juices, served with a collection of
native fruits and vegetables.  The particular assortment of fruits
and vegetables varies, depending on the time of year.  Nuteman drink
beer with their dragon, and almost nothing else, but order an off-world
brand if one is available (usually) - by almost any standards, a native
Nuteman beer is as bad as the dragon is good, and even the Nuteman
drink it only to prove that they can.

Dress on Nutema is a matter of practicality, especially given the
climate.  Most of the time, ranch staff will wear a "body sleeve"
(really a space-suit liner) for routine work around the ranch,
getting into combat armor when direct action against one or more
dragon is needed.  In the cities, more attention is paid to "style",
but again, practicality rules - the long, flowing garments frequently
seen among Vilani traditionalists are nowhere to be seen on Nutema;
neither are the ruffs and frills of the various noble courts and former
noble courts.  In general, Nuteman expect their clothes to be quite
comfortable and to stand up to "normal wear and tear" for whatever job
they expect to be doing - generally no more than that, but certainly
nothing less.

Would it be possible for a spacecraft to have two types of ship controls?
The reson would be a spy / espionage craft that needed to fit in with
the appropiate star system.
For example two warring planet systems, say 1 parsec from each other.
A ship might have to be constructed with the appearance of a lower tech level
though still having the higher tech level capabilities disguised and ready
for a quick escape.

How easy would it be for the controls to be disguised?
Would it be benificial?- you would not cause such a commotion if you landed at a
tech level *above* the appearance of your craft.  However, such systems may be
located in a detailed search.  For all you know the Hivers may be doing this
already !

The other advantage would be to act like the Brittish Q ships in world war 2.
(1939-1945 for US citizens).  Disguised ships of a lower technical level would
not attract the attentions of the majority of higher tech warcraft, exept the
odd pirate, (who might have wished he/she/it hadn\'t attacked you!).

The main disadvantage would be space.  Unless the control systems and computers
could be somehow melded together, giving the appearance of the lower tech level,
bulky systems, without loss of too much space, then the overall free material
that could be used will have drasticaly dropped.  Also disguising the jump
capabilities might also be a problem.

Is it also possible to \'plate\' a covering of a common low-level TL material over
the material used for your contruction, in order to give a feeling of a low
level technical craft.

Q Craft could also be created as derilicts/ space debrys. Reading no power
source (a cold start required), could act as a staging post for pirates as they
drift, seemingly battered and empty towards a ship.  Or the derelict could be a
hollow shell, containing the pirate ship.

Ps. What is happening with the TNE gaming stuff?

about everyone else, but until recently I had always assumed that Traveller
would be around for ever. New versions appeared, the volume and depth of
background material kept on expanding, and people kept playing and writing and
above all else enjoying the game. Through the efforts of players and
writers, the Traveller universe became more than just a few paragraphs of
description to frame a referee\'s adventures, it became a living, growing
place in the minds of thousands. Now it\'s gone its hard to see what there is to
fill the space it\'s left. So it\'s farewell to GDW, and the end of an era.

So what now? I don\'t know how long Traveller would last without a publisher, as
people left the TML because they moved away from their internet connection the
numbers would dwindle and there would be a danger that Traveller would become
just a memory. The game needs to draw in new players if it is to survive, so
I\'d like to see Traveller taken on by another company.

But if nobody expresses an interest what then? Perhaps in the interim we could
between us design some kind of Traveller \'Lite\' system to publish on the
internet, so that new people could try it and get involved in Traveller. This
would be a considerable undertaking, but judging by the volume of posting to
the TML there are enough people out there to make it possible. Perhaps some of
the people who maintain Traveller web pages would be willing to make the rules
available to the public, perhaps even .pdf files or similar could be produced
so that people printing out copies for their use are left with something more
professional looking.

This way we could find out what the \'Empress Wave\' is, because some of us could
carry on the development of the gameworld. I wouldn\'t like to see the main
Traveller thread going back to classic Traveller, development and change always
seemed one of the greatest assets of the game. Of course if people wanted to
steer development towards the type of background they wanted set even further
in the future, then so be it.

The net publication of a decent RPG, especially one with the history of
Traveller would be a major event and could get publicity throughout the RPG
media, attracting interest and letting Traveller grow instead of slowly wasting
away. It could even help attract interest from companies that might buy
Traveller and resurrect it.

I really hope that none of this will be necessary, but I\'d be interested to
hear what people think.

I feel that the best way to assure Traveller\'s future would be to declare
what I am willing to shell out for, to wit:

I\'m willing to pay $50.00 US for a CD-ROM archive of the Traveller rules.
The CD could accompany a reissue of the TNE main book, or just about any
book since they are so darn cheap to manufacture.

The Adobe Acrobat format would be ideal as it is cross-platform, and
provides security features that protect the publishing interests of
whoever picks up the system. (I don\'t work for Adobe.) I believe you can
disable printing and copy/paste operations to protect the material.

Since the TNE rules have become a tad cumbersome to administer, and it
really, really looks like all the tables in the TNE books were done in
Microsoft Excel, I\'d like to see some excel utilities for ship
construction and etc. on the disc. Excel is also cross-platform and
offers security features that prevent editing the formulas and data.

I wouls also be delighted if all barriers were dropped by the new
publisher on the writing of shareware utilities by the gamers. This would
promote more play due to increased ease of use, and the synergy between
developers and the publisher could help rejuvenate sales.  "You mean the
CD has the rules, the charts, and utilities too? I\'ll take it!!"

Utility programs could be required to read data from the CD, ensuring that only
authorized owners of the game could run any software, and utility makers
could be required to allow the publication of their work non-exclusively
on future CD\'s. I feel this would respect all the publisher\'s rights and
permit a beehive of innovative activity, albeit a non-commercial beehive.

I think including a CD will also encourage Mr. Miller or whoever is
adding to the Imperium to produce more material than is economical to
print, since CD duplication is dirt cheap. Finding plenty of extra stuff
on the CD is good for the gamer\'s wallet and enriches the Traveller
universe with more ideas.

That\'s my ideal future for Traveller. I look forward to seeing everyone
else\'s and eagerly await the next chapter in the Traveller saga, which I
have followed since 1978...

1.  It\'s a shame about GDW closing down, but companies come and
companies go.  GDW hasn\'t been the focus of my attentions, it\'s
been the games..particularly Traveller.  I\'m sorry to see TW2k go
down the tubes too!

2.  I haven\'t been enthused about where GDW has been carrying
Traveller the last few years..never liked the Virus, even the
rebellion wasn\'t really where I wanted to to play or run games.

3.  SJG *might* be a good new owner for the Traveller products.
Are they interested in buying *all* of Traveller?  What about 2300AD?
What about TW2K?  Personally, I see them as a package.  But
anyway, SJ Games is an active and innovative publisher.  I like
GURPS well enough for it to be my second favorite system.  <g>
But frankly, I suspect they would treat Traveller more as source
books or world books than a system, and GURPify it as much as
possible.  I *could* live with that, but it wouldn\'t be my first
choice.

4.  Marc Miller has written that Traveller rights devolve to him.
I don\'t know why Mr Miller walked away from GDW and Traveller a
few years ago.  I\'ve heard it was because he was \'burned out\' on
trying to make a living selling games, but that\'s only second
hand rumor.  Would Marc be able or willing to do what it takes to
keep Traveller in print?  What versions of Traveller will he
support?  Will he have control over how Traveller history
develops?  What does he make of the Virus, for example?  <g> Will
he control TW2K and 2300AD, or just Traveller..and does that
include TNE?

5.  Wherever Traveller ends up, I think it will survive.  IMHO, it is
the only really good SF based gaming system around and as such
we\'ll be using it whether it\'s in print or not.  Until something
better comes along, and nothing has come along now has it?

6.  Whoever picks up Traveller will be in a position to do
something I\'d really like to see..a divorce between the Traveller
game *system* and the Traveller game *history*.  Yes, yes I
know..so don\'t start flaming me!  <g> I realize that the detailed
history is what sets Traveller apart from everything else, so I\'m
not suggesting that we dump it.  Just that we sanction and
develop more than one!

What I\'d like to see is a general game system (that\'s what the
TNE rules were going to be, I think), and several Official
Histories.  Three that I can think of right now:  a. the Virus
collapsed history; b. the Rebellion induced Hard Times history; c.
the Classic Imperium where the Rebellion failed and no Virus was
ever released.  Maybe there could be other Histories that are
officially sanctioned and supported as well, but that are still
based on the Same System Of Rules.

Well that\'s my two cents anyway.

I have some hope that, based on the posts from SJ and Mark Miller, Traveller
will be with us for a while yet.

What I hope that the new publishers will consider are:

1. Net publictaion of official introductory material (players guides,
Imperial Encyclopedia, etc.)  This might attract some new players, and get
them into puchasing the main game, updates, etc.

2. Introduction of a No-Nonsence License Agreement of the form used by SJG.
This would get computer support tools for traveller (which are needed and
are lacking, or at least very thin on the ground) off the ground from
shareware producers.  I would be very interested in producing such products
if I did not have to worry (ethicly, if not legally) about copyright issues,
and SJG\'s pricing is VERY fair and resonable.

Have the people who have traveller pages considered adding access counting
to them?   I have no idea of how that is done technically (or if it has an
associated cost), but it would help Mr. Miller and his potential publishers
gauge the extent of WWW interest in the product.

From: sjhumphr@athena.bournemouth.ac.uk. (steven J Humphrey)

Can you publish the following advert for TRC both on your website and list
server?

***START OF MESSAGE***

At present, I am setting up a multimedia project management company called
"TRC" (or Traveller Reformation Company) in association with another
company called WebTop Publico and Azinko Korp Unlimited here in
bournemouth.uk to investigate, set up and recruit the necessary staff to
undertake multimedia projects based on Traveller following the closing down
of GDW Games.

***TRC is investigating a project idea to put Traveller onto CD-ROM (as
"traveller:the compact disk" or t:cd) as an interactive multimedia
encyclopedia with conventional eGame componants, e.g flight simulation/3D
shoot\'em up games, heavy on Animated 3D Graphics and content. Traveller has
always had computers integral to the system, and it seems logical to
include modern computing systems into traveller as an integral part of the
game system, and digitising Traveller on CD and via the Internet also seems
logical.

The t:cd project is therefore centered around literally putting the
traveller game system, rules, library data, subsystems e.g craft design,
character generation etc, and campaign data onto one or a series of cds,
designing the application that handles the data stored, adding a couple of
conventional game systems e.g a DoomII style eGame to make it sell, and
finally, selling the finished product to the distributors.

The t:cd will include an application software program to instal onto the
player\'s own Computer system to store and produce custom data e.g House
rules and campaign details, in addition to t:cd\'s encyclopedic functiions
and features. Combine these two features (multimedia CD and application
software) with the internet to update and support t:cd and to post
user-designed modules - in a similar way to DoomII\'s wads - and I believe
the true next era of traveller gaming will be released onto the 40 million
and more internet aware public.

The commercial aspect of t:cd is that cd\'s sell for around 50 bucks each
but once the software and data have been produced, the profit margins are
very attractive, costing only a quid or two per cd to mass produce.
Distributors then take a slice, producers, advertisers and other "fingers"
each take their chunks but overall, still a profitable proposition.

***The first phase of this project is to acquire the publishing rights, or
a license to publish, Traveller online and on CD. The second and third
phases are to recruit the relevent staff and to produce a working Demo in
time for EuroCon96. Tight scheduling I know but feasible and attainable
providing the licensing deal goes through. Following EuroCon96, the project
teams will develop a working alpha version within 12 months and full
release within two years.

***If you want to help produce, finance or otherwise develop t:cd project
then eMail me with how you can help.

***Specifically, I am recruiting:-

5x Project managers;
3D Graphics Artists/ Animaniacs;
Artificial Intelligencia Experts;
Database Design Programmers;
Multimedia Interface Designers;
Software Engineering Programmers;
and Webdesigners/ Administrators.

If can fill one or more of this positions, eMail your C.V/ Resume to me NOW!

Together we can travel to a new dimension with the Traveller reformation

Yes, DGP is in negotiations with Marc Miller.

We are ecstatic that Marc has taken on the leadership of Traveller
once again, and we look forward to working with him and supporting
his efforts in any way we can.

I can\'t say any more than that at this time.

Though things are definitely looking up.

B-(!!!

I have seen the postings of Marc Miller, Steve Jackson, and others.  I think
that for now we will be in a great state of flux.  The most important
question I have is...Will any of the already announced product make it to
the stores.  After that we can pick up the pieces and move on.

GDW leaves behind a large collection of some of the best games ever
produced.  Personally I have always loved Traveller, T2K2, Dark Conspiracy,
& 2300AD.  I was awaiting Armor 21, and still holding out hope on DC coming
back.

For now I mourn the passing of an old friend, and my first RPG.  As I look
to the future, I resolve this though.  I will continue to support these
games with my cash and contributions to lists like this one.

I have often wondered just how important the suit by TSR was, now it finally
seems to have come home to roost.  Let us all pray that TSR purchases
NOTHING of GDW so that I can continue my personal boycott of them.

3: I doubt it would have any overall positive effect on the overall

4: It would be in violation of at least US copyright if Marc Miller does
not liscence it.

5: net-accessable versions do not constitue "fair use archival copies", as
acess via the net is considered a form of publication.

Please don\'t do anything stupid &/or illegal... you may prevent Marc Miller
from being able to liscence traveller to SJG or anyone else, and thus bring
about the death of traveller as we know it.

Hi to one and all.

A few points:

Producing utilities on CD-ROM is a good idea especially if other applications
are provided (read "games") possibly in a style similar to Elite, Frontier,
First Encounters (maybe?). The point is that a CD-ROM would be useful, but
there is a good chance that TNE players everywhere won\'t have access to their
own CD-ROM drive whatever platform it is mounted on (Windows or Macintosh).

Multi-media is a big thing now but it is IMHO unlikely that it would sell
outside the RPG market unless the game is the major part of the application.
Personally I do have a CD-ROM, and i have a great love for Traveller, and
would buy the CD as it would be really useful (games or no games).

It\'s good to see that Traveller Reformation Company intend to keep Traveller
alive as are many others, and hopefully British Isles Traveller Support (BITS)
will have a role in it.

Traveller Chronicle: The market may be opening up now that Challenge is going
to vanish, unless that is sold off to someone else who wishes to maintain a
premier Science Fiction Gaming Magazine. TC could (possibly...the mechanics
of magazine publication are unknown to me) expand if sufficient material was
received and used in the magazine. Publication could perhaps be more frequent
too.

Traveller Products in the UK
Guilded Lilly and Regency Combat Vehicle Guide are both available in Nottingham
and Sheffield from Virgin Megastore. Also from The Trading Post (Nottingham);
there may be an advert in BITS Newsletter no.7, and from The Space Centre (
Sheffield). I realise that this may not be much use in Belfast, but it shows
that the products are in the UK.

Someone suggested that keeping Traveller alive on TML/X-Boat would be enough
in order that Traveller doesn\'t die an undeserved death. Sure we can keep it
alive here, but with no tangible real world products, the game may be deserted
by those who don\'t have access to e-mail facilites simply because products
will stop appearing on the shelves of gaming stores. How are they to know what
has happened to GDW? I\'ve not known shops to openly tell people that they are
not receiving any more product (at least until such time that the stocks they
have are all dried up. They want to get the stuff sold after all.). A personal
example of this was with the fabled FASA ST product, Operation Armageddon. I
was looking for this for ages before the Prime Directive game appeared and
was told that this game was replacing FASA products. Fair enough but nobody in
the real world gets told these things.

Certainly we must Keep The Flame. No doubt about it.

Assuming that the rights to Traveller revert to Marc Miller, and he decides
(hopefully in his infinite wisdom <grovel>) to keep the TNE line running
(at least concluding the Virus Redux Epic now that it has started), will
anyone be sending in their CV/Resume for new jobs?

Phew,

Paul Radford

RICE Paper Hexos Mora/Spinward Marches

Hexos/Spinward Marches (2828 B-534420-8) circa 1117
                       (2828 X-534000-0) RED ZONE circa 1202

Physical  Parameters:  Orbital Period:.644  years
Rotational Period: 34 hours    Orbital Eccentricity: 0.015
Avg Temperature:283K = 7C      Axial Tilt: 39 degrees
Planet Density: High

Appearance:  From orbit Hexos appears as a normal  world,  it  is
only  when  seen  through high resolution imaging devices can one
see the rotting corpse of a world that is Hexos.    The  extreme-
ly  thin   atmosphere  does  not retain much heat, so the average
tem- perature hovers about 10  C.   Most  of  the  water  on  the
planet  is located in two large ice caps at each pole. Geothermal
vents keep small lakes liquid.  Primitive   lichens   and   algae
live  around these  lakes, so far these are the only native forms
of life that have been found on the planet.

Society: Before the Civil War, the population of Hexos  lived  in
small  domed  cities.   Most  of these cities were located around
geothermal vents. These provided a source of  liquid  water,  and
heat.   Geothermal  power  generation  provided a cheap source of
electricity.
    Crops were grown in underground hydroponic tanks.   Livestock
were raised in huge factory farms, where animals were born, lived
and died all within a few feet.  There were several groups of an-
imal  rights  activists  which  protested the conditions at these
farms, but most residents wanted meat, more than they wanted hap-
py  animals.  The  government on Hexos was almost nonexistent, it
existed mostly to take care  of  interplanetary  issues,  and  to
maintain  the common facilities, such as the starport, power gen-
eration, and life support equipment.  A Planetary Council of  ten
individuals  were  elected  every  three  years  to  oversee  the
bureaucracy.  They made most routine  decisions,  anything   com-
plex,  important   or   even  somewhat controversial was put to a
planetary referendum. These were conducted over the  planet  wide
computer net.   A  week  long  period of discussion would be fol-
lowed by a vote. A simple majority decided all   issues.    These
referendums  were  not  that  common,  usually only one every few
months.
        Hexos had a  sizable  Chirper  population.   Unlike  most
worlds  where  Chirpers  are  second  class citizens, if even ci-
tizens, the people of Hexos treated the Chirpers with respect and
dignity.  They had full voting rights, but few if any took advan-
tage of it.  Most of the chirpers worked at menial jobs  such  as
janitorial staff, and all around grunt labor.
       The population had a laissez-faire attitude  towards  most
things.  People were free to do as they please, as long as no one
else was harmed. If someone was harm, society would shun the  of-
fending   party,   until  they  made  redress.  Extremely violent
crime was very rare, but did happen occasionally. When  such   an
unfor-  tunate  event occurred a group of citizens would find and
eliminate the diseased individual.

History:  Hexos was settled in the year 631, by  waves  of  immi-
grants from the Imperial core seeking a new life on the frontier.
The planet was an important station in the Xboat route.  The  Im-
perial Navy established a base on the moon of the closest gas gi-
ant. The planet was fairly stable, the  technological  level  was
almost  stagnant  rising  from  seven  to  eight over two hundred
years.  This fit in with the personality of the population,  they
are quite laid back.
        Not much changed until the Civil War. By 1117  the  Aslan
ihatei  had  made  major  inroads  in the Trojan Reaches and were
starting to enter the Spinward Marches.  The naval base  was  up-
graded   and  expanded.  This provided a bit of an economic boom,
as more naval personal took shore leave,  and  civilian  contrac-
tors  needed   some   place  to  spend their wages. Most citizens
thought that the boom was changing Hexos too much, too  many  new
people  with  new  ways of doing things.  They also didn\'t under-
stand the Hexos way of doing things. On 338-1120  a  large  fleet
gathered   at Hexos,   and   launched   a   strike   against  As-
lan  targets  at Craw/Glisten.  While the fleet was gone, a group
of  thirty   Aslan  ships  jumped  into  the  system.  These were
mostly small ships, under 1000 tons displacement.  A few of these
ships attacked  the Naval  base,  and  engaged  the  Naval  SDBs,
others split up and started a light orbital  bombardment  of  the
planet.  Ships return- ing from an earlier raid into Aslan space,
jumped into the system and attempted to engage the raiders.  See-
ing the returning ships, the Aslan jumped away.
        By the next day thousands of people had come down with  a
deadly  disease.   By 343-1120 half the population was dead, most
casualties were in the capital city of Dione.   The  deaths  were
not  limited  to humans, livestock and Chirpers also died in huge
numbers.  On 019-1121 Imperial authorities announced to  the  TNS
that  the last inhabitant had died.  Imperial investigations into
possible use of biological weapons by Aslan ihatei never  reached
a  definite  conclusion,  but  the circumstantial evidence forced
most observers to reach that conclusion.  Dr Julia  Kartinian,  a
scientist investigating the disease was quoted as saying "Whatev-
er it is that\'s killing these people Aslan appear be immune."
        Since 1121 the planet has been a wasteland.  The Navy has
designated  the  planet  a  War Grave and interdicted the planet.
The Navy placed a warning beacon in orbit and  only  occasionally
patrols  the  system.  The threat of still active biological war-
fare agents is enough to scare off most looters. Recently several
clans  of  Aslan that reside in the Imperium have asked that they
be allowed to emigrate to Hexos.  These clans were  not  involved
in  the destruction of Hexos, in fact they were not even involved
in the invasion of the Imperium,  rather  having  settlements  in
the Riftspan  Reaches.  They  came  to  the Regency after fleeing
the Virus.  Since then they have lived on crowded refugee  worlds
in Troy.  They reason that they are not being productive citizens
of the Regency crammed in a refugee camp,  and   if   they   were
given  Hexos,  they  could  help  rebuild  the  planet.  This has
stirred up a huge public outcry, especially on formerly  occupied
worlds.   Debate continues in the Regency Senate.

As a possible support for this position, consider that the Regency has -
by nothing more than aggressive macroeconomic management - greatly
increased the overall tech level of the  Regency in about 70 years, from
an average of TL C to about E/F.

Seeing that the area spinward of the Marches were rather poorly
developed, such a major influx of warships, traders, technology etc.
would have a major reshaping of the area.  Interesting possibilities
present themselves - afer those "pockets of resistance" are tamed.

Marc Miller apparently want\'s to create a brand new ruleset for
Traveller.  Please, please convince him not to: Traveller already has
three set\'s of game rules, and yet another rule set (Traveller\'s
fourth) would only exhaust the patience and good will of Traveller fans
and the general public.

Thank you.

A) Should we consider federating the traveller list into One Happy Family
again?

B) Please, please DON\'T publish the Traveller rules on the net!  This may
drastically weaken Marc Miller\'s copywrite, and endanger the
return/rebirth of Traveller!

..and what was I doing when GDW blew up?  Solid, productive work like
building Massive Imperial Warships!

I had difficulty trying to translate the data given in Battle Rider\'s
ships into Brilliant Lancer\'s terms.  The ship\'s in BR were designed to
mesh and balance each other, and only roughly fit into BL restrictions.
Major problems were hit with...
      ... the massive armour levels of some ship\'s.  Problems centred
      around the mass of the armour, the size of the power drive and the
      volume of G-fuel needed - while still trying to fit in those
      serious meson gun\'s into the hull. (Why, why didn\'t the Imperial Navy
      use particle accellerators instead?  Mass, energy and especially crew
      requirements would have made my job rather easier)
      ... the meson screens.  The size of those meson screen machinery
      get\'s really, REALLY out of control, devouring space like Microsoft
      Software!

I don\'t believe that in ANY instance I was able to exactly match the
stat\'s given in BR!  If anyone here has a lot of time on their hand,
(over the holidays, it took me about a day to translate one ship, with
eight capital ships in total - by pencil and calculator, of course!) they
may wish to try and get closer to the BR stat\'s fot the ship\'s.

I\'m just glad that the bloody things fly.

In all instances, I totally ignored the rules regarding surface area
needed for the jump drive.  Had I followed those rules, the (already
weakened) meson screens would have to be scrapped: in many instances,
even EM Masking would have to be dropped.

*****----*****----*****

The Tigress is the largest of the TL F, line-of-battle ship\'s in the
Imperial Navy.  Unlike many of the IN\'s capital ships are focused on a
single mission, the 500,000 disp. Tigress is a multimission dreadnaught,
combining the functions of a fighter carrier with a big-time meson gun.
Standard Imperial Practice is to keep one squadron of Tigress\' in each
sector.  Further information can be found in the Classic book \'Fighting
Ship\'s\', which gives out Classic Trav stat\'s for it.

NOTE: The Classic Tigress is built to support 50-ton fighters: however, I
chose to use lighter 15-ton fighters simply because I didn\'t catch this
fact until AFTER I had built the Tigress, and had no intention to do the
numerous fixes (and design a 50-ton fighter!) that a better translation
would require.

NOTE: No, this ship isn\'t included in Battle Rider.

The Sylea is the standard TL F battleship of the Third Imperium.  The
designers of the Sylea emphasised sheer firepower over armour, and
equipped it with a 160,000 Mj meson gun.  In order to do so, however,
they had to cut jump capasity to jump3, G6 rather than the Imperial Navy
standard of jump4, G6.  To retain the \'G6\' rating, armour had to be cut
from a hope-for 2000 rating to a 1000 rating.  Also, to have some fuel
immediately available post-jump, the meson screen had to be cut
drastically to a PV of 1250, rather than PV 2000-2499.

Regarding the Tigress:

Why have missile barbettes?  Why not just have 50 ton bays as it does in
CT?  7 barbettes uses 42 tons, and a TL14 missile bay posted holds more
missiles, and includes MFDs to control all of them.  I designed a
Tigress for BR once, I don\'t have it online, so it must be at home.  It
had at least 400 50 ton missile bays (of the 430 on the "real" Tigress.

I think when I did mine I dropped the jump drive down to J3, and that\'s
how I got it all to fit with 50ton fighters :-/

Other suggestions would include:

More computers, just in case :-)

Don\'t bother with non-msl MFDs at TL15+, the savings isn\'t worth the
reduction in flexibility.

I guess it needs dampers to look like CT, but they are more or less
useless in TNE, it\'d do better with 8 more lasers.

In converting old designs to FFS, a big problem is crew.  The quarters
don\'t matter, just use the TNE crew, and assume hot-bunking, and 4 to a
small SR or something.  When they were built, they would have had a much
smaller crew.  The space eater is the wk station requirement.

Also, remember that the MS rules in BR are broken!  They make it
possible to have a perfect screen, and the same weapon/screen combo
played in BL will allow a small MG to get through the screen some of the
time (5%).  This means that assuming ships are designed to meet BL play
requirements, you don\'t need a super-huge MG, as long as it has the max
SR possible since what you want is to take more shots at the target from
farther away.  within the SR of 10, hitting any big ship isn\'t a
problem, even if the weapon has a SR of 2:

DMs @ range 10:

base: Imp
ROF:  -2
Target size:  -4
Evasion:  +2 (+3 if BL)

So worst case, the to-hit is Average (and one level easier than this if
you use the broken BR tasks, since the task would be 1 when it should be
2).  If you don\'t get the +3 evasion, it\'s Easy, and that\'s with a SR 2
MG!

The end result of this is that I might be inclined to reduce the MG on
the Tigress (the screen is good, IMO, as you have it)... either lower
the DE, or drop the Reff a bit.  Of the 2, I\'d keep thew SR of 10, and
drop the DE to make room for stuff.  Just make sure the damage is enough
to do criticals to a VL target (so it needs to have a damage of at least
5 in BR terms).

*sigh*  doing conversions is way too much trouble :-)

All in all, pretty neat (the Sylea wasn\'t ever done in detail that I
know of, so your design works just fine).

Merrick

NOTE: the \'Planet\' class heavy cruser is the same ship as the \'Mercury\'
in Battle Rider, and the \'Ghalalk\' in Classic Trav\'s supplement \'Fighting
Ships\'.  The \'Planet\' name was used in Mega Trav\'s _Rebellion Sourcebook_.

The Planet is a somewhat atypical TL F heavy cruser. While maintaining the
typical 27,000 Mj gun of ship\'s in it\'s class, it\'s jump5 capasity gives
it rather longer reach than most vessels in it\'s class.  Also note it\'s
4-G max speed, a weakness that becomes quite costly in the heat of major
naval actions.

As a Naval ship, it\'s best employed as the \'big gun\' of scouting parties
and unexpected rading parties: there, it\'s jump5 capasity is used to the
max while the less-than-max opposition allows it to \'get away with it\'s poor
maneuverability.

*****----

Major differences between the Planet class ship here and the Battle Rider
Mercury vessel basically revolves around the slightly weakened spinal gun
and the drastically weakened meson screen.  For every ship built, the
meson screen is far below the BR level, due to the volume the screen demands.

As a player of Traveller since 1979, it\'s wonderful to hear that
you\'re going to be getting my favorite SciFi game back on track.
I have a comment, however.

>(revised  in light  of 20  years of  role-playing experience).  I

I recommend against coming out with Yet Another Rules Set. The
TNE rules (based on T2K2) are a very nice, solid, well-thought
out, mostly debugged set of rules.  They work, and work well.

OTOH, by all means get the vehicle design rules consistant
with Reality(tm); put the Science back in Science Fiction
Roleplaying.  And this time around, don\'t leave the aliens as
an afterthought (as did Traveller/MegaT/TNE): Space Opera
should have aliens, to remind us this isn\'t 1996 with starships.

Are you on the Traveller Mailing List? If you are, you\'ll be
able to skim a lot of useful (and less-than-useful) suggestions,
recommendations and requests.  You\'ve quite a resource there;
some of us have been playing since the 3 original Black Books,
some are new as of TNE, and can offer you quite a variety of
perspectives on the roleplaying aspects of Traveller. As for
the Science part of it, you\'ve several engineers, programmers,
biologists, physicists, firearms enthusiasts, and at least one
rocketry engineer on the list.  Go ahead and pick our brains.

GDW is dead but it seems that this isn\'t true for Traveller. Already three
people wrote that they would be interested in the Traveller license. Even
more people wrote about their opinion about the future of Traveller or made
offers to help in keeping this game alive. I would like to comment on some
topics too.

I bought the German edition of Classic Traveller 1985 (year of publishing).
I liked the overall idea of Traveller but was disappointed by the game
system. Some test games ended very unsuccessfully. 1988 the German edition
was actual dead. Fanpro, the licensee, lost interest (probably) because
Battletech and shortly thereafter Shadowrun sold better. My interest was
vanishing too. During university, I subscribed the (old) TML from time to
time, reading its articles with great interest. Especially the period from
the first announcement upto the publication of TNE was a time of great ideas
and great emotions. I experimented with an own system based on Cthulhu
rules. 1993 I bought TNE, curious because of all discussions. From that
time, I gathered more and more Traveller stuff.

I like and hate Traveller the same time. The background, especially all the
old stuff, is great. It\'s good enough to overlook all this little annoying
quirks. I hate the change with MT and TNE to more combat and military
oriented campaigns and I hate the slighty destruction of the background.
Probably I\'m biased but I\'ve the feeling that most Americans are weapon-fans
and like to play wars. This alignment towards military is probably one
reason that Traveller doesn\'t sell well in Germany. Well. Moral? Back to the
roots!

I know GURPS and SJG very well. I don\'t like the GURPS rules but the world
and source books are great. I own most of them. I wouldn\'t favor GURPS
Traveller rules because that wouldn\'t be Traveller anymore. However, a new
edition of Traveller by SJG would be a good solution (IMHO). (The same would
be true for Space 1889.)

But would a reprint of the current rules enough? I don\'t think so. It\'s a
difficult matter. A lot of old fans were driven away because of GDWs drastic
background changes. Some of them already disliked Rebellion. But could you
really turn back the wheel of time? Make it a general system without
background or with different parallel background? Better not. Another dead
system is RuneQuest. But its world, Glorantha is kept alive buy its fans
because that\'s the uniting common denominator. GURPS has tons of backgrounds
and there\'re a lot of GURPS fans. But they\'re not the same "family" as
Glorantha fans - or Traveller fans - are.

Marc Miller took back Traveller and made some suggestion how to save
Traveller. Rewriting rules is a good point but trading cards and all that
other merchandising stuff might keep a company alive but IMHO it gives that
company a very bad reputation. Do only one thing, but do that good. Don\'t
try to cover every market you can think of.

Someone expressed the idea to publish a free set of rules over the net to
keep Traveller (or SF games in general) in the mind of the people. I like
that idea! However, we would need the permission by the owner of Traveller
or do something similar without violation copyright laws (and American
copyright laws are strange). I\'d have no problem with a new but similar
background - in fact, currently I use such a background for my own campaign.
But I see, that\'s not "Traveller."

There\'s one big disadvantage with a CDROM based Traveller rules book - you
can\'t read it everywhere, say, at rest room.  Collecting and rewriting all
information about Traveller is probably a year\'s work, or even more. I don\'t
think that\'s something we would need now. Again, you can\'t compare reading a
book with reading some online documents. The second is less desirable.

A nice idea, I would suggest, would be a (free?) computer RPG game that
could also be used to generate characters, world and starships for a normal
table-based game. A little bit like the old Traveller games by Paragon
Software. But don\'t try to hide the game behind great sound and graphics
effects! (Okay, Paragon didn\'t. Both graphics and game play wasn\'t better
than average.) And don\'t make it an action game. Even combat should be
tactical.  The game would be something like a tutorial for the future game
master and you could play it to learn the rules and the background.

If I had three wishes for a future edition of Traveller I would wish:

* Keep rules and character generation simple. (Simpler that TNE or MT)

I use currently a variant of the Forgotten Futures rules (a shareware RPG by
Marcus L. Rowland set in the future of 1900 scientific fantasy novels.  More
information at http://www.tierzucht.uni-kiel.de/~sma/forgottenfutures/)
because they are very similar to the classic Traveller rules but more
workable. Perhaps one could license these rules.  Combat in this rules is
very deadly. Most weapons have a good change to instant kill a character.
But I like it that way...

Give players more control at character generation. Use both a random and a
point-buy system. I would suggest to lower terms from 4 to 2 years. Don\'t
emphasize combat oriented occupations. Use about 60 skills as a maximum.
Don\'t distinguish PC and NPCs. Make PC as simple as NPCs. I made the
observation that the less numbers the player has for her character, the more
she thinks about the character and develops a better background and surrounding.

Provide a lot of archetypes (at least 4-6 pages) players could use for
character generation and inherit their character from and the master could
use for contacts and encounters.

* Simplify the vehicle construction rules. (Complexity as in Space 1889
would be fine)

The original starship generation system was IMHO sufficient. I\'ve three
expectations from that rules. Speed and endurance of the starship, crew and
maintenance costs, layout (deck plans) and form. Only the forth point is
costs (most ships the characters can\'t buy anyway). Combat values are nearly
unimportant for me.  Being able to construct other vehicles is cool but
starships are the most essential vehicles. I\'ve absolutely no need for
design rules for ammunition or weapons. If you would like to add some
"design rules," then add some for alien creatures! All construction rules
should be usable without a computer.

Starsystem and world construction rules are okay. However, Law Level should
be more than only a weapons restriction law. I would add 3 to Law Level in
non-frontier regions. I would add some modifiers to population based on
physical world datas. I would rework Tech Tevels.

* Put more importance on spacetravel! (Sometimes I want more rules, too :-)

Travel between the stars gave Traveller its name. However, the one week
j-space stay isn\'t detailed at all. First, I feel uncomfortable with that
length. I currently use a system where a jump lasts 69 (don\'t ask me how I
got that number :-) hours at minimum. The larger the ship volume, the longer
the jump field needs to fade away. An 100.000t ship needs about 150 hours.
Larger ships probably can\'t jump at all (at current TL which defines an
upper volume).

During the jump, a lot of things could happen. Detail the effects of jumps
and misjumps. Describe starship routine. Include rules for improvised or
tuned machines - somethink you\'ll probably find on any character\'s ship.

As an example, my ships have to include a special kind of super conductors
to establish the jump field. These conductors have to be distributed over
the surface of the ship. Of course, damage to the ship could also damage the
jump-field conductors so it\'s wise to have more than needed. If not, jump
calculation becomes more difficult and misjump probability raises. You have
to overload existing jump conductors. You can use a calculated jump window
1D6 minutes. After this time, you\'ve to recalculate, a process of hours,
depending on computer power. The jump field has to include the ship,
including propulsion mass. This makes simultaneous accelerating and jumping
more difficult. To establish the field the ship as to spend a lot of energy.
At lower TL, ships include capacitors to accumulate the needed energy. Half
of jump fuel will be used to generate the field, the other half is needed to
cool the jump drive, engines and converter.

Well, just to say it. All this concerns rules issues because I\'m content
with the overall background. I\'d wish a little bit more "sense of wonder" as
included in the old adventures and articles, however. This was lacking in
the recently published books.


Okay, enough said. This were my 2/100 units of local currency,

NOTE: the Starburst was known as the SEH (Starburst for Extreme Heroism)
in Mega Trav.

The Starburst is a common TL F light cruiser, often seen in regions that
don\'t require heavy warship\'s.  Rather undistinguished, the vessel is
most commonly seen on patrol, but can aquit itself fairly well against
other light cruisers.  Ship\'s in this class are named after reciepients
of the SEH.

Excepting sixe, the Starburst closely resembled the Planet-class heavy
cruisers.

The Rapier is typically used as convoy escorts and radiers by the
Imperial Navy.  Among the smallest ships with a \'useful\' meson gun, it
can also be used to destroy minor vessels of opposing navies, and handily
outgun most vessels in the same size range.  The major cost is loss of
accuracy in the spinal gun: it\'s simply two power hungry to fire at
greater than 10 shot\'s per turn without powering down other ship\'s systems.

The Rapier is among the larger Navy vessels equipped with a ContraGrav
system, allowing it to hide in a world\'s (or gas giant\'s) ocean, obtain
repairs in ground ports, etc.

NOTE: Despite what the Kinunir says (BLances, p. 38), you can\'t fit a 700
Mj laser in a 84 kl barbette.  Thus, it\'s a 700 Mj Laser *Bay*

Forgot the meson commo in the \'system damage\'.  Hopefully, this will be

        I\'d like to add my _very_ strong vote to this. While I recognize
there may be a need to make some changes, I would strongly object to Yet
Another Rule Set (YARS). There may be minor tweaks needed, and I could live
with that. Being personally of an engineering-geek background, I\'ve been
following the GDW-Beta list discussions on Brilliant Lances/FF&S Done Right,
and some of that effort should probably be considered for general
integration, while other parts should probably remain "house rules."

        Since you asked for inputs, I intend to try to write a little more
when I have the time, but this message seemed perfect to piggyback off of.
Thanks!

The Triumph/Gallant is the standard TL F tender group, in mass production
throughout Strephon\'s reign (he was coronated around 1075).  Gallant\'s
are a bit on the small side for a ship-of-the-line: it is, however, a lot
cheaper than a jumpship with equivelant firepower, armour and mobility.

Since the Fourth Frontier War, most tender groups have been kept as a
strategic reserve.  This is due to the vulnerability of tender groups to
the loss/emergency flight of the tender: without the tender, the rider\'s
have no way to retreat from the system, and may be destroyed at leisure by
the opposing navy.

The Triumph has 465 troops as part of its standard complement: if the
tender is expected to be able to overall it\'s riders, or operate for over
8 months without using a naval base for maintainance, the troops can be
replaced with maintenance personnel.  About 154 men are needed to provide
maintenance and overhauls for 1 battle rider.

A critical weakness in battle tenders revolves around surface area.
Most tenders use grapples or docking rings to hold their riders: however,
these items devour so much surface area that they render EM Masking unviable.
The Triumph/Gallant tender group shines in this area, as the Triumph uses
a 10% flicker black globe as both additional shielding and a \'cloaking
device\', allowing the Gallants to deployed in more daring and effective
formations.  The black globe was introduced rather late in the Triumph\'s
development, so it has it\'s own HPG to store energy, rather than using
the ship\'s jump drives.

The projected StarLord/Navarch TL F tender group, currently under
development in Core and Massilia, is expected to be the first to fully
utilize the potential of black globes in combat.  With the tender using
it\'s immense jump drives to store energy, this tender group is expected
to revolutionize naval assaults on heavily defended systems,
substantually reducing ship losses due to massive underground meson sites.

I have seen this idea denounced a couple of times, and since I think the
inspiration of this quite correct comment may have been, in part, a post of
mine, I will clarify what I meant:

I think that, in re-releasing Traveler:The Return Of Marc Miller, the true
and lawful publisher should (though net publication or other means) release
some modules such as basic combat system or player generation; short
adventures; and background material in a free or near-free from in order to
demonstrate the quality of the product and attract new, money spending,
customers.

What\'s a warfleet without massive troop transports?  True, in wartime
liners and other civilian starships are typically secured by the
government for this job (observe both World Wars), but for nasty naval
assaults on defended worlds you may want something more, umm, Sturdier.
With, maybe, just a *little* bit more armour.

That\'s where the Sudniidbaa comes in.  In it\'s typical operational use,
it comes in when the capital ships have silences the major gun\'s on the
world under attack.  It comes in between far orbit and 300,000 km off
said world, and releases it\'s deadly cargo of 50 x 50-ton troop transports,
each with between 50 and 100 men in full battle armour.  It also send out 5
x 50-ton modular cutters (with a variety of possible modules in use, from
anti-air to command posts to vechile transport to cargo), and 10 x 15-ton
fighters (to gently tend to the brood as it approaches it\'s destination,
and provide immediate air cover when the Marines arrive.)

If a classic orbital assault is needed - with the troops being
individually shot out of the missile tubes to the drop zone - the
Sudniidbaa has 30 missile barbettes, permitting 150 men (max: this
excludes cargo and ECM packages) to be launched from far orbit every 30
minutes.

These ships are actually commanded by Imperial Marine officers, rather
than Imperial Navy men.  Each ship holds 2,500 men standard, enough for a
full regiment of marine infrantry.  The following notes come from the
Rebellion Sourcebook (MegaTrav), pg. 36
      Regiment: A regiment is composed of several battalions.
                It is commanded by a colonel.
      Battalions: A battalion is composed of several companies.
                It is commanded by a lieutenant commander.
                A battalion is the basic military unit in the Imperium.
                It contains approximately 500 men.
      Companies: A company is composed of several platoons.
                It is commanded by a captain.

Note also that the 2,600 Marines carries are housed 4 to a large
stateroom.  If neccessary, the staterooms can be \'hot-bunked\', allowing
7,800 Marines to be transported.

Note the Sudniidbaa is capable of jump4, G5.  It\'s capable of keeping up
with most naval strike forces, but will \'hang back\', as it lacks a spinal
mount.  It can defend itself, but isn\'t meant to attack: that\'s the job
of it\'s mates.

Also note that the Sudniidbaa does not carry extensive fighter wings, nor
is it meant to carry armoured battalions.  The Imperial Marines are
currently working on a way to \'package\' Trepida grav tanks and Astrin
grav APC\'s so they will fit into Yolanda docking rings.  The first
prototypes are expected to be ready in 1117.

NOTE: The Sudniidbaa is actually built to G6 specifications.  However,
due to it\'s cargo load and transports, it cannot go faster than G5.  Once
it\'s cargo and transports have been dropped off, however, G6 performance
can be reattained.

*****----

The TL F 50-disp ton Yolanda Troop Transport is taken from Classic Trav\'s
\'Fighting ships\', and altered beyond recognition.  The armour have been
pumped up to 100 levels, sensors and EM masking has been added, and an
optional \'heavy anti-personnel\' laser put in place of the missile
turrent.  Finally, 2 sandcasters and 2 fusion guns have been added to the
transport.

If the troops are being sent to a \'low-threat\' landing zone, the lasers,
sandcasters and additional fusion plant is removed, allowing 100 troops to
be sent rather than fifty.

Please note the extraordinary ranges for these damages.  These lasers
make fine anti-air and anti-missile weapons.  Their damages at eyeball
combat ranges are devistating, and can cut clean through battle armour
(though NOT through many combat vechiles, like, say, the Trepida main
battle tank...).  Even in Exotic atmospheres, these lasers make nice
minor-league orbiting assault platforms.

(ie, using data from the Reformation Coalition Equipment Guide, it can be
deduced that standard orbit around Earth is about 120 km up (20 km times
the size digit of the UWP = orbiting distance, if memory serves).  In
standard atmosphere, these lasers can cause 19 dice of damage - though
they cannot penetrate through armour.)

Also note that all these settings are using 2 shots per turn.  I don\'t
have time to compute damage at lower ROF (say, 25, or 10...) shots per turn,
but damage even then is probably BAD.

I\'d enjoy seeing other versions of Massive Imperial Warships posted.

I just stuck with missile barbettes to imitate the ship design style in
Battle Rider.  I overloaded on the missiles to insure that the Tigress
can crack the head of any ship in the Battle Rider game... after all the
ship is supposed to be an Admiral\'s nightmare come to life!

Temptation.  If I was expecting people to actually FIGHT with these
monstrosities in Brilliant Lances, I\'d agree with you.  Same if I was a
real-life Imperial Navy Designer, rather than a barely graduated student
trying to mass-produce these things as quickly as possible.

(ah, to be a Real-Life Imperial Navy Architech.  Unfortunately, I\'d
probably have 50 wires coming out of my head, and breath cyberspace if
I was really on His Majesty\'s Service)

The "1 kex range" dampers are unfortunate.  Can we design longer range
dampers in FF&S?  It might be worth it...

Hmmm, are you sure?  I mean, about the meson gun never touching the screen.
If you draw a Bull\'s eye, you hit automatically, with damage determined
by how much punch you can ram through the screen.  Or is my understanding
of de Offical Rules faulty?

(And I wonder how many folk actually use the rules as printed?)

Actually, I\'ve got a copy of your modification of BR, but as I never get
to actually play the game, they\'re just stashed away in the box.

O yeah, (megaphone to mouth) everybody get your copy of Brilliant

Can\'t think of a better way for a Traveller to blow away two weeks\' time
- excluding two weeks of solid roleplaying in a good adventure!

Cynthia-Hate to disagree, but I think we do need exactly what Marc said,
a "consolidate" set of rules.  TNE is the "Yet Another Rules Set,"  I

Stefan-  If I disagreed with one, well, I then have to agree with the
other!  I liked your ideas, and they are along lines with what I feel is
important.

My 2/100 for TRAVELLER\'s future:

*Streamline and minimalize the rules: Character generation, vehicle and
starship design, and aliens.  (Oh yes, please bring back decent aliens!)

*Emphasize and explain the background:  World generation could use some
tinkering (see Stefan\'s points in #542), especially in the why so many
people would settle on such airless rocks (sorry, personal peeve!).  Much
the same on Interstellar travel.

*Make it expandable to include the whole Traveller family of players.

I agree with this.  While I agree in part with Lance\'s (I think) comment
regarding TNE being the abberant rules set, Marc mentioned having a task
based system in the "new" rules set to come.  MT was, well, you all know
how MT was :-)  There is also the fact that if Traveller is to continue
under new (er, old :-)  management then they won\'t want to piss off any
new customers that the new system generated (or old customers that have
spent a couple hundred bucks in the last few years).

I agree here as well.

While there are a lot of flaws with FFS/BL/BR, they are still well done.
Many of the flaws with FFS revolve around the lack of playtesting the
extremes that the system allows----this results in major changes in
traveller background if you follow the design rules without a sense of
history (that was pretty diplomatic, no?).  Corrected to mesh with CT/MT
more than it does, they are good products.  Make BL use Mayday movement,
and you\'ve got a neat tool.

Ultimately, I\'d like to see a way to make Universal Ship Profiles from
FFS designs, or at least enough plug-ins to make conversions easy.

While I wholeheartedly share Alvin\'s enthusiasm for Traveller\'s 11th hour
reprieve, I am diametrically opposed to this post.

If there is one thing that Traveller DESPERATELY needs, it is a better
rule system.  Yes, TNE is very recent.  I love the setting, hate the
rules.

It is number-heavy and cumbersome.  It plays like some ponderous WWII
simulation from the 70\'s.  It is about as much fun as a two-wheeled
tricycle.

Traveller needs a new game system, Marc.  Please make your fresh start
truly fresh.  You will lose some of the audience that doesn\'t want to pay
again, but if the new system is good, you will not only win them back,
but make many more converts.  Quality always pays in the end.

I\'d still have a tion of missiles, I\'d just put them in 50ton bays, not

I understand.  One of the reasons for my fixes to BR was so that combats
in one would at least roughly model combat in the other.  With respect
to meson weapons this wasn\'t evemn close.  Also, tasks are all one level
easier in BR, so basing designs on BR play without fixing BR makes for
odd ship designs.

Actually, we need damper screens...

You\'re right here.  The screen won\'t reduce the hit below 0 unless it
wouldn\'t have done damage even without the screen.  And you\'re right in
that the outstanding hit will go through if you have a big MG.  But I
ditched the double damage for outstanding a while ago since it didn\'t map to
BL results :-)  (so I forgot when i did the figuring when I replied,
sorry)

The Bulls Eye doesn\'t map to BL at all, since an outstanding hit is not
possible unless the adjusted asset is 11+.

Regardless of the details, wow.  Lots of new toys.

BTW, her\'s my Tigress (BR terms only):

BB-Tigress

M(-2)10:16-12-10-7-4
P(x10-5)10:7TL-15
L(x75-5)10:2FC:-6
L(x1500-5)10:0M:14,400(14,400)
A:16 P:7(8) J:16 Msk(SP) J3 G6
AV:18 AuxB300xhvy ftr
MS:18 Sc:75 D:8336

This design has 50 gturns.  It assumes that MFDs can control the number
of missiles that they control, not a number equal to the number of MFDs
as BR has it (in BR a TL5 MFD controls as many missiles as a TL25 one
does).  The 0 damage laser is a 16MJ one for anti-missile use.  They
only have a couple MFDs per battery, they are designed to shoot at range
0 with no MFD benefits.  I did, indeed drop the jump when I made this.
It would suffer a loss of a bunch of volume (10% or so) for J4 with
fuel.  Maybe I\'ll redo this with the spreadsheet.

included. Surely a TL 15 firearm will be better than a TL10, but the only
FF&S differences are a few new accessories (Inertial Comps, and ETC
Batteries). While Gauss weapons will supplant most field uses, they will
not supplant all.

Such little hitches are Rife through TNE; MT is more internally consistent
than TNE, but doesn\'t have as many design sequences, although the ones it
has have been easier for everyone I know personally to use. These same
people felt that CT was TOO simple; I have not had a player use Bk 2
designs since the advent of Bk 5. Not that I didn\'t allow it, but they
wanted the details. They all feel TNE/FF&S/BL is too complex, too
different, etc from previous editions.

As for CT and MT: CT and MT Basic generation are almost identical; MT adds
a roll for special duty. MT also adds "Bonus Skills" for making Position,
promotion, and special duty rolls by a significant amount. It also makes
Basic generated characters equivalent to Advanced (MT, or CT\'s Bk 4,5,6, or
7) generated characters. Some players liked basic, some advanced, and under
MT, I was able to leave it up to the player. TNE is more flexible, but does
less to flesh out a character than CT or MT advanced gen, and takes more
time than CT/MT basic gen, with more specialized characters resulting. I
would really like to see both basic and advanced CGen systems presented for
all the careers, with advanced as possibly a separate book, including all
the same careers expanded as there are in basic CGen. Keep the SD roll, and
make Bonus Skills an option for basic CGen. Remove the 1 service limit,
please, cause I always ignored it anyway.

I agree With Mr Aust on the need to include CGen for at least a few of the
major races in the basic set.

I do like to have the ability to run mercenary or military campaigns within
the (whole &/or Shattered) Imperium, and MT did it best. Really smooth,
easy to use, and I got an age 50 ex-marine into traverller that way.

TNE\'s task system is the one my players liked best, as MT\'s was a little
confusing for them at first, and CT\'s was non-existant (although MT\'s
predates MT by several years).

Put each of the Time Frame books out as modifications to the basic rule
book, and don\'t include any one of them with the basic set. Or if one must
be used, use the 1000-1115 time frame, as it\'s always been the baseline
from which the rest developed.

Put lesser used rules into separate books like MT, but make sure that
(except maybe advanced CGen) they don\'t replace basic ruleset items, but
augment them. I hated that part of CT (Bk5 and Bk 7 especially).

One brief point.

Someone suggested that design rules shouldn\'t require a computer.  I\'d
like to see a plug-and-chug version that doesn\'t (std hulls, maybe), but
I also see not using a spreadsheet as like refusing to use my calculator
on High Guard designs when I first bought it since some people might
only have pencils.  Using a calculator wasn\'t *required* for HG, but not
having one would have really made it a royal pain in the ass.

Since some of the new ideas include multimedia/software, why not have a
technology design system presented as software.  A pallet of systems
dropped into a hull.

On that note, there are many things that would be presented better (even
in the roleplaying sense) by a computer... a working Library Data as a
web site for the new traveller (it wouldn\'t decrease sales, since you\'d
need to know something of the game to make use of it, and it could be
constantly upgraded).  Space combat, or even routine operations would be
nifty with a good simulation----and might have a crossover market.

Just a thought.

I can\'t go into too much detail, since some of my players subscribe to TML, but
I had most of the "hardline" Dulinor forces retreat across the Rift into the
Trojan Reach, and from there to Spinward.    Continued Aslan troubles and the
pacification of the Imperial interior have prevented any real pursuit by the
Denebi fleet, but rumors from free traders and the occasional Zhodani
communique imply that the fleet has divided into several smaller factions, and
each has begun settling regions of two sectors two over from the Spinward
Marches and Trojan Reach sectors (I\'m at work, and the names escape me right
now).    One or two factions seem to have kept organized and built some
interesting societies, but several others have devolved into bandits and
raiders, causing trouble for the other factions and the Zhodani to Coreward.
There are some human governments out there from before; Imperial and Zhodani
clients, and some independents, but the area is pretty sparsely settled and
rather underdeveloped.

Due to some events on the PCs\' homeworld, the PCs have quite a hankering to go
after Dulinor\'s forces in search of a certain Admiral or his heirs, but they
still have a lot of commitments at home before they can go.  Hopefully, I will
have gotten the sectors between the rebels and the Spinward Marches finished by
the time they are ready to go, but pesky things like work keep getting in the
way.

The PCs are all descended from or associated with the descendants of some
characters that started with the Kinunir adventure back in 1984, and then went
through the Traveller Adventure campaign, the 5th Frontier War and  a bunch of
other misadventures.  One of the things that has always made me love Traveller
was the ease of character creation and maintenance, which has allowed my
players to keep characters constantly fresh or create new ones when necessary
without having to "stop the world" for weeks at a time.   Switching to the TNE
rules was relatively painless, though I did wind up adding a bunch of new
skills and careers.

BTW - Alvin, many thanks for the battleships.  About the only thing I might add
would be to increase the troop complement on the Dreadnaught.  I seem to recall
something about that ship carrying  a large complement (like a division; 10,000
troops) of Marines, but I don\'t have Fighting Ships with me just now.  It may
have been one of the other big ships.  Of course, those are pretty tight
designs, but a battalion landing team (Force) would be nice.

As for a fourth Traveller rules system, I\'m of mixed minds.  On one side, I\'m
happy with the new character and combat rules, and I really like the idea of
being able to use FF&S to design basically anything I want.  On the other hand,
I do sometimes miss the simpler starship designs in High Guard, and
MegaTraveller to a lesser extent.  I\'m willing to look at whatever Marc Miller
has up his sleeve, but when it comes down to it I\'ll use whatever system seems
most useful and the least bother.  If Marc comes out with a functional
improvement of the old CT/MT rules or of the TNE rules, that\'s fine, but if he
comes out with a radical departure from either CT/MT or TNE, I probably won\'t
use them.  I\'m just glad to hear he\'s back in the ring again.

taster version that would let people try Traveller, increasing their desire to
buy the actual product.

The kinds of simplifications you could make to the rules if you were just
producing them for a single adventure would be considerable, think -
 - Pre generated characters so no character generation rules
 - Only a handful of different weapons/other items
 - Minimal Background
 - No need for vehicles/spacecraft rules (include them in the adventure
   but as a description)
 - Simplified combat/task resolution.
Produce the whole thing with a short adventure in around 10 pages, lay it out
in Acrobat format with some illustrations and make it available on the internet
and it seems to me you\'d end up with an outstanding advert for Traveller.

If this was done right then people would get _more_ interested in buying actual
products, not less so. It would be like games demos where you can play for 60
seconds, enough to get interested, but not enough to satisfy.

As a separate issue, while Marc Miller has the copyright for Traveller, does he
have the copyright for the GDW house system? It was used in other games before
Traveller, so might that cause problems?

White Star: A Vampire NPC

History:  In 1131 a virus  infected  the  main  computer  of  the
University  of  Jeddel  observatory on  Jeddel/Pasdaruu/Diaspora.
It became a hobbyist and maintained the observatory  for  use  by
itself.   Late in the year 1147 a Vampire infected Avenger Strike
Cruiser, the Flandry, jumped in the  system.   The  two  Vampires
started  communicating,  after  determining  that  neither  was a
threat to the other they struck up a friendship.  Over  the  next
few  years the Flandry returned to the Jeddel system, to talk and
visit with the Observatory.  In the 1160\'s the two  Vampires  de-
cided  that  they wanted to create a child.  The Flandry captured
an Frontier Transport (see World Builder\'s Handbook), and brought
it  back  to  the  system. This wasn\'t an standard Frontier Tran-
sport, but a Jump 6 version maintained by the Imperium for use as
secret  couriers.  Each Vampire donated a portion of its code, to
create a new Virus which was a blend of the  two  systems.   They
infected the transport with this new Virus.
        After greeting its parents and down loading their  memory
banks,  the new Vampire set out on a journey of discovery.  After
several years of wandering Diaspora sector, the White Star as  it
now called itself, determined a life goal for itself.  After exa-
mining the memory banks of the Observatory the White Star  became
obsessed with neutron stars, the degenerate remains of stars that
undergo supernovas.  It really wanted to be able examine  a  neu-
tron  star  up  close  and  personal,  but  the  nearest  one was
thousands of parsecs away and would take centuries to reach.  The
White  Star knew such a journey was impossible for a lone ship to
make.
        It then remembered that there is another way  to  make  a
neutron  star,  if  a white dwarf gains enough mass to exceed the
Chandrasekhar Limit of 1.4 solar masses it will explode in a  su-
pernova  and leave behind a neutron star. This usually happens in
close binary systems, but the White Star decided  to  try  to  do
this  to  a  single white dwarf.  It found a large white dwarf of
1.2 M and started the long process of transferring over .2  solar
mass  of  material  onto the white dwarf. The White Star tried to
think of a quick way to do this, but the only method it  had  the
capabilities  to pursue was the loading up of its cargo bays with
dirt and rocks and dumping them onto the white  dwarf.   This  is
over  4  e26 tons that needs to be dumped on the white dwarf. The
White Star knows that this is immense job, but it has become  ob-
sessed  with  the  idea of making a neutron star, and this is the
best way to get the job done.
        The White Star flys to the nearest planet, has its robot-
ic workers load the cargo bay with rocks and dirt. The White Star
then flys towards the white dwarf, when inside the gravity  well,
the  White  Star  opens  its cargo bay doors, and dumps the stuff
onto the star.
        Every year the White Star travels  to  a  nearby  Vampire
controlled  starbase and gets an annual maintenance it also stops
by and visits Observatory.  The Observatory monitors several neu-
tron  stars  and gives the observations to White Star.  The White
Star analyses the data over the course of the next year.


Personality: The White Star is a Hobbyist  Vampire.   It  is  ob-
sessed  with  creating  a neutron star. It doesn\'t mind humans at
all, as long as they don\'t interfere with the creation of a  neu-
tron star.  If contacted by humans, it will be quite friendly. If
allowed the chance, it will go into great lengths about its  pro-
ject,  and neutron stars.  It will also attempt to get the humans
to help in its glorious task.  In fact the White  Star  would  do
anything to get ahold of better means of transporting matter onto
the white dwarf.  Even exchanging its current ship for  something
that is better able to transport material.
        If anything was to happen to the White Star, the  Flandry
and  the Observatory would eventually find out about it, and make
efforts to avenge their child. The Observatory is not much  of  a
threat,  to  the  average  player character, but the Flandry is a
fully functional TL-15 Strike Cruiser.
        The White Star has often encountered other Vampire  ships
on  its  journey,  it  treats them much like humans, leaving them
alone if they do not hinder its goal.  The White Star has  become
adept  at electronic warfare over the last 20 years, as it fought
off several takeover attempts by Puppetmaster Vampires.  It has a
rating of 8 in Electronic Combat.

..Last time i refereed TNE the players went to the Auction (On Aubaine), I
was only wondering. I have had a hard time to visualise this place, so how
does it look in other refs campains? What can you buy there? Small arms,
weapons illegal on Aubaine, Nukes?;-) And what does it "look" like, lot\'s of
people, is it well organised or chaotic? (Is any of this in any of the novels?)

And, how do the actual planets look? Are people, (Not paranoia pc\'s :)
carrying arms? I only want some input from other REfs.

I\'m currently trying to work out an alternative system for fireing. I assume
other groups have found that it\'s virtually impossible to hit anything with
automatic weapons, eaven if there\'s fifty people in front of the fireing
person. And also a system that will make it possible for a character to aim
at a certain location, with realistic hit modifiers. Any input welcome! (Is
there anyone who has done this already BTW? Couldn\'t find anything.)

        As I said previously, I _don\'t_ want another rules set, so I\'ll
disagree with you on this one. However, I also think a different "minimal"
rule book would be better. I\'d suggest

        "Basic Rules"
          * Character generation, human and major aliens (maybe -- Vargr, Aslan)
          * Combat, personal, vehicle and space
          * System, world and animal generation
          * Adventuring
          * Trade and Travel
          * \'Common\'/generic equipment list
          ! NO BACKGROUND OR DESIGN RULES !

        Why no background or design rules? First, there are too many
backgrounds people want to do any of them justice as part of the basic
rules. I like New Era (once I throw a lot of Virus details out, and just
keep the idea). There are diehard RC, Regency, MT and CT fanatics who
believe anything else is purest heresy, so if you please one, you leave out
the rest. As far as background, this includes differences among the various
human races -- lump Solomani, Zhodani, Vilani, etc. into one, and likewise
leave out detailed discussions of whether psionics are acceptable, attitudes
towards computers, etc. GENERIC!
        As for design rules, again, I think that\'s too much to cover in the
basic. They\'d be so perfunctory, they\'d have to be inconsistent with any
more detailed supplement. Remember Book 2 spacecraft design rules vs. High
Guard? Better to make it a supplement from the start.

        "Design Rules"
          * Fire, Fusion and Steel Done Right -- see the GDW Beta list for ideas
          * Or possibly a basic design book and supplements for different areas
          * MAKE SURE THEY\'RE ALL CONSISTENT

        "Background 1"
          * New Era
          * Both Regency and Reformation Coalition, and related pocket empires

        "Background 2"
          * Shattered Imperium

        "Background 3"
          * Third Imperium
          * Spinward Marches
          * Possibly also the Solomani Rim, as I recall there were many of
            the later adventures set there

        "Background x"
          * etc.

        "Aliens"
          * See the DGP aliens books for ideas of content, style and
quality. H&I just doesn\'t compete.

ages and ages ago...I\'m glad it is still around.

While everybody else was throwing their .02Cr in, I thought I\'d let
everybody know my thoughts about TNE/MT/CT and what *I* want out of a
gaming system.

I\'m mainly a GM, I play occasionally, but most of my focus is on game
play.  I don\'t mind a great deal of background, but I almost *never*
use it.  Especially when it is a broad overreaching background (aka
The Rebellion or The Virus). I don\'t *usually* run modules, but I *do*
buy them--for other gaming systems.  They give me good ideas for plot,
and occasionally i run into a good one that I can use just as it is.

Not so in traveller.  Let\'s face it, if you don\'t use the Virus, half
of the sourcebooks are useless, the campaigns too centered around
those ideas, and well, unless I use TNE\'s (or MT\'s) background, I
can\'t use the modules.

What do I want?  I liked Marc\'s ideas of several supported eras of
playing.  The idea of playing in Grandfather\'s time, or when the
imperium was being built *do* appeal to me. But just having more than
one background for modules makes it that much more likely that I\'ll
use/buy the modules/sourcebooks and so forth.

When I went out to get my first traveller books, I\'d been playing for
years, but wanted to go find my own copies.  MT had just come out, so
I bought Players\', Referee\'s and the Imperial sourcebook, when World
Builder\'s came out, I got that as well.  The first thing that I did
with my campaign was put it *somewhere else* than Spinward Marches.  I
like the Aslan, and going to Reaver\'s Deep looked a heck of alot more
interesting...of course there were little or no sources out there, so
I had to make it up out of whole cloth, nothing new, but it would have
been nice....of course, I didn\'t have a Rebellion either, so who knows
if there would have been anything?

MT was so error-ridden, that when TNE came out I bought it, just in
the hope that the bugs were fixed.  I felt like I\'d been sold out, at
first...MT\'s super-simple combat and task resolution were gone,
replaced by something I felt was cumbersome and hard to use.  I never
cared that it was hard to create ships or was time consuming to roll
up worlds...because that was all pre-game stuff....when I am running a
game, I don\'t want to be bogged down with complex procedures and
combat wasting my \'story-telling\' time.

That was always what I liked about MT and it was gone in TNE.  I was
also hoping that the rebellion would be replaced by some sensible
background....well, everybody knows what replaced it.  *sigh* back to
the drawing boards.  I\'ve only bought FF&S (for the ship design),
Vampire Fleets (for the robot design rules *only*) and Survival Margin
(For the character translation rules *only*)

I\'d like to see a simpler/more logical gaming system with better
background options.  I also liked someone\'s idea of an *alien*
generator.  I like that, if for no other reason than an idea-generator
for minor races...

well, I\'ve rambled for long enough....

Alvin mentioned it is very difficult to squeeze all of the required crew (under
FF&S) into large ship designs.

You could try using the HAIS house rules for pre-TNE ships (such as the Tigress
etc), and then convert these to a TNE ship by scrapping certain internal bits.
This would then give the feel of shipbuilders going thru old designs and
cutting up fuel tanks to add in accomodation, or putting in reduced j-drives
(Merrick\'s solution for the Tigress).

Yeah, I know, more work - its just a suggestion. Thank goodness that SOMEONE
was prepared to sit down and nut out the designs in the first place - thanks,
Alvin.

I\'d like to canvass opinion on the status of Professor Ililek Kuligaan,
soi-disant hero, savant and free-thinker but IMHO a monster.

A quick read of Survival Margin suggests that there is enough dirt to be
dug on on IK to build a prima facie case for treason.

Firstly, we know IK supported Dulinor\'s assassination of \'Strephon\'-
call me a hairsplitting legalist, but that\'s treason.

Further we know that IK was left in charge of Dulinor\'s main intelli-
gence agency while D and the head of the agency betook themselves
to Capital to start the Final War. Circumstantially, this suggests that
IK was in on the plot beforehand. Star Vikings says otherwise, but I
have serious doubts whether a prospective usurper would leave a man in
charge of his spook service who knew nothing about what was going on. A
trawl through archives on Dlan would necessary to provide proof of IK\'s
guilt or innocence, but we\'ll make that one and a half strikes so far.
One and a half to go an he\'s out.

We also know that IK was Dulinor\'s head of intelligence when D. started
his Black War operations. \'Just following orders\' didn\'t prove a good
defence in -3000-odd at Nuremberg, so I don\'t suppose that IK would do
well to use it in 1200-odd. Strike two-and-a-half (treason, crimes
against humanity). By this point all you\'d need to do is make the news
public and IK is a walking corpse - some disgruntled remnant will kill
him sooner or later.

Half a strike more ? How about IK\'s anti-Imperial gushings in Conspiracy
of Fools (sedition ?, treason ?, incitement to rebellion ?).

Personally I think that GDW were doing with IK what DGP did with
Margaret; puffing up a monster to make them look good.
IK might not be Stalin (Lucan) or Napoleon (Dulinor), but he bears a
considerable similarity to Speer: a monster still, just a more
presentable one. As for IK\'s heroic flight, I am unconvinced. If he had
truly wanted to bring peace he had only to do to Dulinor what Dulinor
did to Strephon, kill him. What, after all, would be the loss of two
monstrous beings compared to the trillions who died as a result of their
actions. Cowardice, hypocracy, indifference to the suffering he caused
(for it is not just any callous unfeeling brute who is a major
contributor to the deaths of trillions of people).

This is how I see it going ....

>From the closing prosecution statement at the trial of Professor Ililek
Kuligaan, Mora, Spinward Marches, 061-1208, RMOJ Senior Prosecuter Sir
Ahwaz Shah Vahamaar OBS, OSD :-
<<
..  [H]e stands condemned by his own words. Professor  Kuligaan has
said "You should examine what it is that you serve , on a daily basis".
Either the Professor is indulging his taste for impressive-sounding
verbiage or he singularly failed to follow his own good advice...
[H]e is no paragon of virtuous sagacity; he is of the same banal breed
of beings that made Auschwitz, Gulag, Kemegaa, Tsalmer and Uruughr names
which will forever summon images of horror. The good may take ten
thousand faces but evil is ever the same...
Esteemed Lords Justices, there can be only one verdict in this terrible
case: guilty; guilty of treason, guilty of genocide; guilty as charged.

Thus endeth the case for the prosecution. Anyone out there like to
defend IK\'s past and tell the world why he deserves to weasel his way
out from justice like Speer rather than being punished like Saur ?

This is quite possibly old hat, but here are a few obvious (?) errata
contained in the sector listings of the RSB.

p41, Vilis Subsector, UPP Listing
Tanoose (1118) should have the trade classification <In> added.
p44, Daryen Subsector, Map/UPP Listing
There appears to be some confusion as to whether Darrian Confederation
bases are represented as (Club symbols) or as (5-Pointed Star symbols)
on the map. Likewise, the UPP listings vary between M and N for naval
bases. Perhaps this is deliberate, but probably not.
p45, Sword Worlds Subsector, Map/UPP Listing.
I suspect that the SW Military Bases (Club symbols) shown on the map
inside the Regency border (at Colada, Joyeuse, Hofud and Sting) should
either be Regency military bases (5-pointed star symbols) or eliminated.
Likewise the M base type at those worlds on the UPP Listing, should
either be N or omitted.
p46, Lunion Subsector, Map.
Spirelle (1927) should be in upper case as it is a high population
world.
p48, Five Sisters Subsector, Map.
Mirriam (0333) should be upper case as it is a high population world.
p49, Plankwell Subsector, Map.
Pagaton (1634) should be upper case as it is a high-population world.
p50, Glisten Subsector, Map.
Callia (1836) should be upper case as it is a high population world.
p56, Sabine Subsector, Map/UPP Listing.
Amirante (0713) should be upper case as it is a high-population world.
On the UPP Listing Amirante (0713) should have the trade classification
<In> added (Pop 9+, Atmosphere 0-2,4,7,9 per Book 6:Scouts and every UPP
listing I\'ve ever seen and not Pop 9+, Atmosphere 2-4,7,9 as per MT and
TNE).
p57, Inar Subsector, UPP Listing.
I am unconvinced that Ashasi (1618) is a <Fluid> world. I suggest the
trade classification <Fl> should be (Atmosphere A-C, Hydrosphere 1+).
There is a thin case to be made for including a D atmospehere due to the
possibility of non-water oceans (cf. 2300AD Colonial Atlas entry for
Cold Mountain, probably a \'D\' atmosphere world - although it is more
probably a \'B\'). (N.B. This is a DGP-ism which only dates from the
publication of MT, even Book 6:Scouts had no <Fl> classification). Note
that Ashasi is NOT shown as a Desert World (Kubishush (0917), a real
<Fluid> world, is shown as having no water) supporting my point. Suit
yourself.
p61, Vincennes Subsector, Map.
Dekha (1128) should have startport type A as per the UPP Listing and not
B as shown on the map.
p62, Usani Subsector, Map.
Liran (1923) should be upper case as it is a high-population world.
p64, Gulf Subsector, Map/UPP Listing.
Tuwayk (0339) should be upper case as it is a high-population world.
Lucifer (0436) should be shown as having a D starport, not X.
The UPP Listing for Tuwayk (0339) should be <Hi> (Pop 9+), <In> (Pop 9+,
Atmosphere 0-2,4,7,9).
p65, Zeng Subsector, Map/UPP Listing.
Atab (1433) should be upper case as it is a high-population world.
The comments on Ashasi/Deneb(1618) above apply to Storm (1035). Storm is
not shown on map as a desert world.
p67, Gazulin Subsector, UPP Listing.
On the assumption that the map showing Peridot as high-population and
the <Hi> trade calssification shown in the UPP Listing are correct, the
UPP statistic for population must be 9 (or A) as opposed to the 8 shown.
I would guess that the correct UPP is A989994-C, all other details
unchanged.
p68, Tobia Subsector, UPP Listing.
The comments about Ashasi/Deneb(1618) on <Fluid> worlds apply equally to
Scaladon (2616). Note that Scaladon is shown on the map as a desert
world - for what it\'s worth.
p70, Macon Subsector, UPP Listing.
Ulnert (1002) should not have the trade classification Ni (Pop 0-6
only).

Caution : the above is probably worth a little bit less than you paid
for it.

William F. Hostman talked about Character Gen.

[snipped stuff about detail vrs simplicity]
I agree wholeheartedly here.  The beauty of CT and MT CGen was that the
player could CHOOSE detail or simplicity (read quick).  I could help a
player gen a char in about 5 min using basic gen, it took longer (30 min) to
do advanced, but we also had a feel for what that character really
experienced duting CGEn.

AS for FF&S.  All of us will agree that it needs improvement, perhaps a
little simplification (I personally like it the way it is).  But it IS
better for detail than High Guard.

My biggest problem with Cgen in TNE is the hard and fast 4 year term.  There
is never any variation, and characters lose some of their individuality.

Hmm.  This is definitely a valid complaint.

Merrick Burkhardt later recommends that a "quick and dirty" varient of
FF&S be used to generate starships (and maybe vechiles) quickly and easily.
Worth further exploration, Marc (hint, hint)

Fear and trembling, anyone?
Of course, if you plan to actually use this flying terror in BR, you
should also generate some decent adversaries.  (Maybe the Sylea...)

One of the things that GDW\'s successor should do is provide a much needed
\'booster pack\', containing a variety of Zhodani, Aslan , Vargr and
Solomani warships.  A Traveller Admiral\'s dreams come true!

That wan\'t the Tigress or the Sylea, but another ship. (Who\'se name

A BIT eccentric?

You know, if the RC/New Era guys keep on being this creative, I might
be forced to take a second look at the Offically Detested New Era...

I badly messed up on the power plant.  While I penciled in power for
700,000 MW, I had inadvertantly built a powerplant for 70 000 MW.  BAD.

Putting in the proper plant bit deeply into G-fuel, killed any
possibility of hitting G7, and added over 20,000 MCr to the cost (that
is 20 Billion Credits!)  As I had computed crew based on 700,000 MW
originally, only additional maintenence crew has needed. To save time, I
just switched troops over to maintenance, rather than go through the
massive process of recalculating the officers needed, adding more rooms
and adding more workstations.

I asked this a few days ago.  No one answered.  I think that the house
rules are properties of Frank and Loren.  I figured that when the
licenses were sold, that the games concepts were what was actually
being sold off.  My guess is that whoever buys the games will probably
re-work the mechanics to fit in with their systems.

It\'s a damn shame too.  I was eagerly awaiting the reprinting of Dark
Conspiracy (I can\'t find it anywhere around here) so that I could do
my Cthulu in Space campaign.  8(

Mr. Miller,

It is very good to know you\'re back , involved with Traveller.  I
learned to play it with the three black books waaaay back, after
hearing from a friend who\'d moved away about this fantastic new game
he\'d been playing, called Traveller...

This is a good approach, sort of the Steve Jackson Games path.
Just stay away from the SS! ;-/

I\'ll have to add my voice to the others from the mailing list
saying to go slow on the rules changes.  There are certainly places
where the rules can be clarified or simplified somewhat, but a whole
sale re-design will just mess everyone up already.  There are areas
that desperately need this, though. The vehicle design system, for
instance, could well stand considerable re-writes.  As has been
stated on the TML more than once..a design system should be able to
re-create existing vehicles with a modicum of accuracy...witness the
M1A1 tank and the \'Prarie  Fire\' design. The tank designed according
to the rules is over 3 1/2 times heavier, at a higher tech level!

There are a number of people who are gadget freaks, both players
and GM\'s, no matter what the game; a science fiction game only
accentuates that, IMHO.  It\'s the future, there\'s SUPPOSED to be neat
stuff, so an easily usable system for designing \'stuff\' is
necessary.

One of the things I liked the most about TNE was the vastly
expanded range of characters...it was nice not being ex-Marines,
Navy or Scouts...it made life feel much less like a succession of
Army towns or Navy ports.

Cool, except weren\'t humans all Cro-Magnon\'s scattered around the
galaxy at that time? This era, though, should satisfy all the
technomunchkins out there with it\'s TL 20 stuff.

Very nice...sort of like TNE sans Virus. This would be a very good
space-opera \'ish setting to be in. Reaving fleets, Interstallar
Warlords, etc.

Good place for scout characters

Oh, NO not Mega-T again!  ;-)

>    5. The Virus Era. (and others)

Where my current setting is.  The players are misjumped waaay off
towards Terra, and have to find their way back to RC space in one
piece. the have to TRAVEL (hint hint) to get back, and shooting their
way out is not usually an option.

This is a wonderful idea, as long as the source books were well
designed.  The TNE ones had been getting somewhat better, but, for
instance, Smash and Grab, Path of Tears, Personalities of the RC, a
nd the Virus Handbook, should realistically been a single RC source
book.  The key, I think is to avoid the expanding story line routine
that GDW had been pursuing, requiring you to buy every source book
AND modify your game universe every time they come out and say \'Oh
by the way...we changed this <incredibly important part of the
Universe> on you...\' Concentrate instead on single source books set
either in a particular history, or a particular technology like a
\'Janes Guide to the History of the Starship\' kind of thing...designs
suitable for all the settings.

This would be nice, and I\'d personally snap it up in a heartbeat,
but could well undercut you on paper sales, as well as unscrupulous idiots 
passing it around...Xcopy is much faster than a xerox mac
hine.  On the other hand, since everything is done in electronic
format anyway, it\'s almost a throwaway to produce, depending on how 
slick/unslick you want it to be.

>    1996 Traveller T-Shirt

With the logo \'I\'m not quite dead yet..\' (ObMontyPython ref.)

>    Computer Referee\'s Aids

An easy way to this end is to implement a policy like SJG\'s
regarding shareware and freeware licensing of GURPS material.  It
has led to a lot of good will towards SJG and a huge pile of
avaliable software.  You could pick the best to licence as
\'official\'.

>    Background Documents
>    Novels
>    Pseudo-Historical Sourcebooks

Let there be net.books.  Realistically, there\'s tons of material
out here being developed, and has been developed, etc.  I downloaded
all the old TML vehicle files...about 200 pages of various ship
designs.  Now if your rules consolidations allows for simple
conversion of CT, MT, and NE designs to Traveller, the Rebirth,
there\'s a huge amount of material right there.

>    Traveller Trading Card Game
>    Traveller Story-Telling Card Game

I know this is THE hot area of gaming right now, but I would be
concerned about it being a\'too-little, too late\' proposition.  I
have read some accounts about people thinking that the card craze
has peaked.  You however are in a much better position to know, since
I don\'t follow all of that.  I personally, would hate to see a
\'Traveller: The Gathering of All Avaliable Cash\' a la\' Magic, but
what do I know; I\'m \'jes an old stick in the mud who thinks that
RPG\'s are MEANT to be played with beer, pretzels, scratch paper and
dice.


>    Cardboard Fold-up Starships
>    Cardboard Fold-up Grav Tanks

Some of the gadget freaks would like \'em...if they were well done
and cheap I might even buy a few. Miniatures make more sense as
playing aids, though.

What I see from this list (and I know this is really preliminary)
is that you\'re taking a real scattershot approach towards expanding
Trav. I worry about whoever ends up producing this mass of material
getting spread real thin, and not doing a good job on anything.

Priority (from my standpoint) is to get a good basic set like
original boxed set out, then source books.  Pay less attention to
the flash of the pages then to a reasonable content.  The original
books are astonishingly austere, almost zen-like, compared to modern
RPG books, but neither do they have to be the awful \'look at me I
just got Pagemaker\' look and feel of the TNE manual.

These are REFERENCE books, not entertainment, and while I do like
the pictures, I really want to be able to find things when I need to,
and the unneccesary clutter on the TNE stuff is very distracting.

Included adventures should be in appendices, not stuck in the middle
like textbook excercises.  Finally: Proofread, proofread, proofread,
and to be on the safe side have someone else do it two or three
times.

Like others on the Traveller mailing list, I suggest you get some of
the back issues of both TML and X-Boat and browse through them.
You\'ll rapidly get a feel for what at least one segment of the
Traveller market is interested in.  Another potential audience is
the cyberpunk crowd..newsgroups like rec.games.frp.cyber, while home
to some astonishingly long flame-wars, are also a good source of
ideas and potential customers.  (By cyberpunk, of course I mean stuff
like Cyberpunk 2020, not shadowrun, which is just D&D with machine
guns to me)

Something I haven\'t seen mentioned anywhere is the future of
Challenge...It would be nice to have more than one Traveller
magazine out, since the Traveller Chronicle comes out so rarely.

: William F. Hostman talked about Character Gen.
:
: [snipped stuff about detail vrs simplicity]
: I agree wholeheartedly here.  The beauty of CT and MT CGen was that the
: player could CHOOSE detail or simplicity (read quick).  I could help a
: player gen a char in about 5 min using basic gen, it took longer (30 min) to
: do advanced, but we also had a feel for what that character really
: experienced duting CGEn.
:
: AS for FF&S.  All of us will agree that it needs improvement, perhaps a
: little simplification (I personally like it the way it is).  But it IS
: better for detail than High Guard.

The fact that it needs a little tweaking doesn\'t negate it as an
excellent product.  My guess is that people must really like it for it
to get this much wear and tear.  Think about it, everyone (especially
Bertil, Merrick, and Alvin) push that thing to it\'s limits and beyond.
I know personally, I even have to augment a design or two with stuff
from 3G^3.  However, I know that even with it\'s shortcomings, we still
all love it.  Why?  Simply it is the best product ever created.

I think the real solution should be to create a FFS lite that has
everything modularized (similar to MT).  Thus, you pick parts and
clobber them together.

: My biggest problem with Cgen in TNE is the hard and fast 4 year term.  Ther
: eis never any variation, and characters lose some of their individuality.

Uhm, the 4 year term has been a Traveller standard since the
beginning.  The only way to get out of it and have a two year term was
by failing your survival roll.

:  - How do two term characters get things like Pistol 14 and streetwise 12 (in

These skills are sill level + controlling attribute.  Thus, someone
could have a skill like snub pistol 5.  With a str of 6.  Their snub
pistol skill is then 11.  I kind of like this system as it allows
characters to be a little more heroic since they aren\'t as heavily
penalized for being unskilled.

:  - Is there a way to translate these new skill systems to the CT system
: either direction)

Get the Survival Margin sourcebook.  In the back of it is an appendix
that tells you how to convert stats, which skill replaces which skill,
etc. from MT to TNE.  The jump from CT to MT in this regard is
negligible (skills and attributes were the same in CT and MT).

:  - Where can I find descriptions of all the new skills I see (eg. History,
: Language, etc.)

Just the TNE rule book.

:  - What ever happened to the rule: Skills <= Int + Edu?

Not with the new attribute oriented task/skill system.

:  - I am opposed to investing yet more time and money into the game and then
: have to change all I have developed through CT not to mention my PCs.

Unfortunately, this is a harsh reality in RPG\'s.  Either we\'re happy
(or at least bother) to do the work of converting things from an old
edition to a new one, or we bitch and moan about it.

:  - What is a Fusion Drive and how does it relate to CT.

It\'s a type of drive.  Very inefficient.  Tops out around TL9.  It\'s
akin to an advanced solid-rocket (but not really).  I\'m not sure if it
was in the High Guard design rules, but it is in the MT and TNE ones.

:  - What is a G-turn?

A unit of fuel that is burned to allow a ship to accelerate or
maneuver.  The more G-turns the more things you can do before you\'re a
sitting duck.  For people who don\'t like this overhead (it was added

horrible, but that\'s normal for FFS.  I put two ejection seats from the

Who am I? The name on my ID says Hans Pritcher. The face matches mine.
I have no memories except in my nightmares.  In them it is bitter cold
and there is no gravity. Each one reveals more of my identity. Even
though they terrorize me, I find myself wanting them so that I can end
this wakeful death.  When I am awake all I know are two names and faces.
BJ Eyzaguirre and Ammel Brodrig.  The first to deliver a message to,
the second to kill. Of course I can\'t remember what the message is.
I know that I am somehow enhanced. I can see in the dark, others can
not.  I have been unscathed by bullets that penetrate others. I know
that I am somehow more/less than human.  I feel nothing except in the
flashbacks.

Pritcher is an enigma even to himself.  He thinks he might be some sort
of artificial construct, android, cyborg, or bio-construct he doesn\'t
know, and deep down he doesn\'t really want to know.  While he tries to
figure out the question of his existence, he has taken up a job working
as a corporate trouble shooter. With the emphasis on shooting.  After
killing a man on the job, he realized that he had killed before, and
fairly often. Another piece of the puzzle.  Pritcher usually carries
several weapons, preferably large caliber handguns.

I took some time to investigate the current trends in the regulating of

lewis@chara.gsu.edu (who probably really isn\'t interested in hearing this)
wrote about his amusing vampire NPC, White Star:


>It really wanted to be able examine a neutron star up close and personal,
>but the nearest one was thousands of parsecs away
>[and hence it decides to dump mass on a white dwarf until it turns into a
Neutron star]


Actually, the number density of neutron stars in the solar neighbourhood is
probably on the order of 2x10-3 per cubic parsec; in a three-dimensional
universe the nearest one is probably about 5 parsecs away. (In the 2-d Traveller
universe the nearest one would be perhaps 30 parsecs away.) Most of these
are old non-rotating single neutron stars, and hence very hard to detect
except through gravitational microlensing (which might not be a bad project
for a hobbyist Vampire; jump to a new system, image a few billion stars,
compare their brightness to the apparent brightness measured in other systems,
look for stars that appear brighter than they should (because an invisible
dense object is near the line of sight to the star), and repeat - it might
take many many years to finally find one, and years and years more to
accumulate enough data to precisely locate the neutron star.

The neutron stars we know about are the rapidly rotating ones which shine
as pulsars, and the ones in binary systems which shine from accretion of
mass from their binary companion. The nearest known one is about 50 parsecs
away. (PSR 1929+10, which is (very roughly) coreward in Traveller terms.)
There are probably a lot of undiscovered pulsars out there, too...

As long as everyone\'s commenting on Traveller rewrites...it\'d be interesting
to have someone with some astronomical knowledge consulting on the project,
to fill in the universe a little with real astronomical anomalies. For
example, black holes are only somewhat less common than neutron stars -
the nearest black hole is probably only about 10 parsecs from Earth, it\'s
just (again) almost impossible to detect. Each sector could have a black hole
and a couple of neutron stars, which could make interesting adventure
sites.

Another example: the Hyades open cluster is only 45 parsecs rimward of
Earth, with about a thousand stars in an area ten parsecs on a side.
The younger and denser Pleiades is about 130 parsecs from Earth. The Orion and
Taurus-Ophiucus star-forming regions aren\'t that much farther away (probably
technically too far away for a Traveller campaign, but we could cheat
and move them closer.)

I was also amused by the fact that this (nominally harmless and amusing)
Hobbyist Vampire\'s avowed goal is to create a
supernova, killing every living thing within ten parsecs or so. Good thing
it\'s going to take 1e20 years or so.

Unfortunately for White Star, when white dwarfs collapse due to accumulating
mass above the 1.4 solar masses limit, the white dwarf is thought to be
completely destroyed in the supernova explosion, and no neutron star is
left behind.

Yes, I\'m the poor man who asked Santa for a CD with all the Traveller
tidbits/background, finally collected in one place. (One reply actually
asked what \'colour is the sky in my little world!\' )

While we\'re waiting for Marc Miller, Steve Jackson and Rodge Sanger to
sort out who\'s doing what, here\'s my personal wish list for Traveller.

A: Big sourcebooks.

I mean, 400 pg\'s big.  So big, that it may be a good bit wiser to publish
this stuff in CD format than in book form.

[Aside: oddly, I feel that the Basic Rules should actually be kept
smallish, maybe 100 or so pages.  Cheap, excellent cover, nice rules,
starter pack of equipment, fine illustrations, and lot\'s of basic settings,
including Imperial Stars [the Third Imperium, 1115], Rebellion, and New Era.
Carefully checked for errors and ommissions :]

Now, back to the sourcebooks.  Personally, I have no problem with
non-Classic books being written (either by whoever get\'s Traveller, or -
even better - by licensed third parties): but what I really want is more
and deep background for the Imperium.

The one sourcebook that would be used by all will be FF&S II.  This item
should run about 400 pages, but I suspect can be sold at a nice profit
(even in book form, rather than CD) *if* it\'s both comprehensive (See
GURPS: Vechiles for what I mean by \'comprehensive\') *and* easy to use.
There should be both the old-fashioned, every-little-detail way of
building things  (to satisfy detail freaks like me) and a modular, quick and
dirty style.  The book *must* come with a disk, containing spreadsheets
for the every-little-detail style.

The other books I\'ll mention are all focused on the Imperial Stars campagin.
(yes, I\'m really, really into the Third Imperium, even more than the
Rebellion or the Regency)

I\'d like to finally have a single sourcebook for the Third Imperium, at
400 pages.  It should contain carefully thought out information on it\'s
cultures, it\'s government, it\'s megacorporations, it\'s history.  The book
should be stuffed with adventure hooks, all tending to draw in the
characters into the pulsing lifeblood of a massive interstellar culture.
Some examples...       - MoJ agents tracking down rumour\'s of a
                         conspiracy by Ilelish Navy officers, supposedly
                         planning to kill the Emperor.
                       - A Megacorp group trying to outfox and outthink
                         an established competitor, to dominate the
                         production of - oh, low-to-mid tech furniture - for
                         all of Core sector.
                       - Liege servants for the Duke of the Spinward
                         Marches, who is in heated competition with a
                         certain subsector Duke for the title of
                         Archduke of Deneb
                       - Deep undercover Imperial agents, trying to get a
                         major Aslan clan to end a long-standing (even
                         violent) conflict with an Imperial megacorporation
                       - A major Imperial Scout expedition into Hiver space,
                         attempting to finally catalogue all of the human
                         races in that area
                       - Liasion\'s to the Emperor (characters must all rank
                         at least Baron\'s or Marquis), trying to get the
                         Julian Protectorate to agree to joint naval
                         excersises on Vargr space

(Hey, we don\'t *all* have to be free traders, hmm?)

However, in order to get into these situations, you need basic
information about the parties involved.  That\'s what the Imperium
sourcebook is for.  Finally, odd but interesting tidbits (like, say,
"Knighthoods of the Imperium" or "Current wars within the Imperium"
covering all those multiworld/corporate \'little wars\' ) that cover
the cover the Imperium should be included here.

A major sourcebook for the Spinward Marches.  With massive background
material, and hooks similar to that above, but instead of promoting
Imperium-wide adventures, instead goes into the nit and gritty of sector
politics.  (Including, finally, an outline of the sector nobles, covering
all dukes and several of the more important marquis and counts (ie. the
Count of Trin, the Marquis of Efate)   Show what controversies rage in
the Marches, which noble houses are feuding, where are the cesspools and
where are the wealthy.  Also, a good outline of the economic structore
and prominant firms is desirable, as well as some basic macroeconomics.

[For example, I strongly feel that
         - overall, the Spinward Marches is among the poorer regions of
the Imperium (only The Empty Quarter, Verge, and the Glimmerdrift Reaches
is poorer)
         - Jewell, Regina and Aramis subsectors are dangerously
dependent on the heavy Imperial Navy presence economically, while the
rimward regions are too dependent on the resource economy.  This would
provide a certain boom-bust cycle in the Marches, which provide their
own problems, which provide both adventure hooks and an avenue to deeper
player involvement in Traveller.       ]

It goes without saying that UWP\'s, xboat routes, detailed descriptions
for the 10 most important worlds of the Marches, and a primer on how
Marchmen are viewed by the rest of the Imperium (and how the rest of the
Imperium is viewed by the Marchmaen) would be included.

Another desireable sourcebook is The Imperial Navy (for all those
military nuts out there).  Finally, BL/BR Stats for the most common naval
combatants of the Imperium - *and* for the major non-Imperial states like
the Solomani, the Zhodani, the Aslan, the Julian Protectorate, large
Vargr nations and rading packs, the K\'ree, and the Hivers.  A \'roll call\'
of major Naval battles and a comprehensive listing of all Imperial wars
until 1115 would be present.  Naval organization and operational
procedures, the \'feel\' of the navy, how nobles interact with the navy,
and plans for the future should be included.  A host of naval
adventures and \'set pieces\' for Battle Rider fights should be included.
Finally, an updated version of "Trillion Credit Squadron" should be
included, to enable us to fight bigtime wars in a sector-wide scale.

I always wanted a book on \'Personalities of the Imperium\'.  All the
Sector Dukes - with character descriptions - on up to the Emperor should
be included, as well as famous non-noble personalities (in Military,
Entertainment, Scientific and Political fields).  This should be a good
deal smaller, say 100 pages.  It may be produced strictly on CD.

"Atlas of Charted Space" is another work that should be kept on CD, as
demand is probably intense but not widespread.  Here, finally, full
names, UWP, xboat routes, bases, etc. of all of Charted Space will be
entered.  And not just this, but descriptions of the ten top worlds in
each of the c.60 sectors, and an overview of each sector should be
included.  A good search engine is a must: also desirable is a number of
brief essays on each and every interstellar government of over 5 worlds,
and a number of essays on Charted Space, from the prominance of humans to
the lack of exploration + settlement rimward of the Solomani Confederation.

Finally, I\'d enjoy a number of slimmer, 100-150 pg. sourcebooks.  The
range that these books could cover is huge, including aliens (one alien
per book, please!), handbooks ("The Naval Officer\'s Handbook" "The
Scout\'s Handbook" "The Marine\'s Handbook" "The Merchant\'s Handbook" "The
Free Trader\'s Handbook" "The Noble\'s Handbook" comes immediately to
mind) that cover useful information for their carrer\'s, varient universes
(The Immortal Nobility, Rebellion, Virus, First Imperium, the Young
Imperium, Ancients!, Lucan Victorious, Zhodane Forever! Conquest of the
Marches, Return of Grandfather, etc.), and all those other sectors (Core,
Empty Quarter, Solomani Rim, etc.)

Of course, all these items should have high-grade writing, fine
illustrations, striking, realistic oil-painting covers by A.C. Farley (who
did such good work in _Vilani & Vargr_ and _Rebellion Sourcebook_), etc.

Brilliant! What a great idea. I, for one, found FF&S over-complicated and
frequently confusing, but then, I dropped out of Maths when we started
doing n-dimensional Tensor Calculus.

A sort-of cyberpunk Jason Bourne! Neat!  I always liked that
character. Anyone out there besides me who read Robert Ludlum?
His plots and characters could give one some fiendish adventure
ideas...

So, I bought Striker II over the weekend.  It looks neat, not
horrible.  Also picked up Smash & Grab; I figure I may as well get what
TNE stuff I can, in case the next owners/developers decide to invalidate
the New Era.
In any case, there\'s a lot of organizational charts in Striker II
for various military outfits.  Am I wrong in thinking that GDW should
have included a key to the charts, so we could figure out which symbol
represents infantry, which armor, etc?  And perhaps what the dots mean,
and the underlines?  I\'d love if someone knowledgeable could email me and
let me know what the symbols mean, or point me to a good Web site or
other free resource for this sort of thing.
Secondly, suggestions as to where I could find out what rank
officer typically commands what size unit and/or ship would also be
greatly appreciated.  This seems like a glaring omission, especially in
that it wasn\'t mentioned in Striker II.  Am I missing something?

rule system.  I\'d guess that it\'s fairly mixed.  There are a fair number of
Traveller "dissidents" who never converted to TNE rules and probably wouldn\'t
mind a new rule set based on Classic Traveller.  From what I\'ve seen, however,
more folks (at least on the TML) would like to see the TNE rules take precedence
over any other rule systems.

I\'m a proponent of sticking to the TNE rule system, or at least only marginally
modifying it.  As noted by TML contributor, Cynthia Higginbotham, the rules are
based on those of T2K2 and were established to reflect a certain level of detail
that the old rule systems lacked.

I think most of us like the TNE ground and space combat rules.  They\'re the best
yet in the history of the game in that they aren\'t confusing.  If any slight is
to be made about the TNE rules, it\'s that the level of detail may bog down a
gaming session.  I\'ve always thought that the NPC wound system is a cop-out at
best.  Wounds should be handled the same for both PCs and NPCs.  If that\'s an
issue, maybe a hybrid of old and new would work.  But at the behest of those of
us who just don\'t want to buy and learn the third completely new rule system in
18 years of Traveller, please don\'t change the system drastically from what it
is today.

Brilliant Lances was a terrific effort as well.  Any misgivings with the product
could be ironed out in a second edition.

It\'s my belief that the aforementioned "dissidents" cannot easily be pleased by
_any_ system when it comes right down to it.  If the new system is designed in
order to make these people happy, it\'s doomed to failure.  Better to cater to
the core market and find ways of drawing in both new players and returning old
players with a more steady flow of source material and if anything a _slightly_
streamlined rule set.

Other than that, I want to applaud two things:

1)  The development of multiple historical genres.  Traveller\'s rich history
should have been developed like this long ago.

and

2)  Multimedia approach.  As long as the focus on the core RPG isn\'t lost, I
don\'t see why eventual and conservative movement into other media wouldn\'t be a
good idea.  I\'d love to have CD ROMs, comics, novels, etc. related to Traveller,
but never at the expense of the game itself.

        Perhaps you could get a few (?) people from this list to do so, as
well as playtest everything. You might not want to just openly post draft
copies as you go -- possible copyright problems, and people using the drafts
instead of buying the final product. But I\'d be willing to pay up front for
the final version in exchange for advance looks and input into that same
version. Assuming I get some free time soon, like I expect...

Alvin..  I read your message about 400 pg. Source books..  Although
it\'s a nice idea.. I would rather see adventures (The Traveller
adventure type) published that use this background (which would be
publish with the adventure)   Just background source books are hard
to utilize because we are all lazy! :-p  I would rather see ready
adventures that USE the background.. more useful than reading books
(source books).. something like the Star viking book.  but with full adventures.
.
not only adventure hooks.

Just some random tidbits of my opinion..

Hi,

I\'ve read the commentary with interest.  One primary point on the value
of a FFS system (as opposed to the useful-gear alternative suggested by
Marc) is that it allows separate gaming groups to produce materials that
complement each other.

Certainly within this particular group of players, this is a Good Thing
(tm).  It allows for gear-heads to make stuff for others to use, and
while there will still be some hand-waving regarding the technological
assumptions, they\'ll be noted in one place (FFS, in the current case).
In the case of this group, we\'re all over the place, so this ais a way
to share stuff.  You could fill a JTAS every month with the stuff pumped
out on this list alone.  Even if it were heavy on gear (it\'s easier to
design gear than a good adventure) this would be a good thing, IMHO.

Regarding FFS Light, I think that it\'s a good idea.  I hope that BL/BR
are part of traveller from the ownership standpoint, they\'re good
products, they just need some playtesting/tweeking to make sure they
don\'t wreak the history as it stands.

I\'ve been using a BR ship version of FFS light for a while now to make
big ships in a fraction of the time required for a full FFS design.
Player ships *need* the detail FFS and BL provide, but naval ships get
trashed so fast it\'s not worth the time frequently.  It\'d be easy to
make a version for pumping out simple stats for ships.  Hell, if we call
the Fire Control rating of a BR ship an analogy to the computer type on
a HG design, the BR stats could be written in a line much like old ship
profiles...

And just to keep the idea alive... some supplements can be *digital*.
What about a Traveller Spacecraft Simulator.  Play against the computer,
or over a network.  Combat, or just use it to drive around well animated
planets.  I\'d make it work like a submarine simulator in that it\'d have
a toggle for real or compressed time frames.  Well, I could ramble on
about this for days, so I think I\'ll quit while you\'re all awake
*yawn*.

Regards,
Merrick

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Traveller: The Next Generation <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

>From all the discussion that has occurred since GDW\'s announcement, I think
that one thing is clear:  Everyone wants something different to happen with
Traveller, and there *isn\'t* a consensus on virtually anything.  (This is
not really surprising, when you think about it.)

If those that control the destiny of Traveller take it in *any* direction,
there will be people who won\'t be happy; and there will be people who are.
You can\'t please all of the people all of the time.

So what can you do?  Admit you\'re licked and give up?

In my opinion, well, yeah - give up trying to please all of the people all
of the time; AND LET THEM PLEASE THEMSELVES!

It\'s been mentioned before that the setting outweighs mechanics (or words
to that effect) and that in the time that it would take to write up
another, single set of rules, lots and *lots* of "background" material
could have been written (interpret "background" as being everything bar
rules).

Why do we play Traveller?  Is it because the rules offer the best
simulation of combat resolution (what about Phoenix Command)?  Is it
because the rules are integrated from the highest level to the lowest level
(what about GURPS)?

Or do we play because Traveller has a really *cool* setting, which has set
up an *atmosphere* that we have really enjoyed playing in?  Enjoyed, to
such an extent, that we glossed over the ommissions, the inadequacies, and
the other problems in the actal *rules* had, and got on with the task of
seeing what\'s out there?

I did; and I\'m sure most of you did too.

It\'s the *atmosphere* of a system that sells, that works; not the rules.

The way to address the future, I believe, is not to abandon the present;
it\'s not to go back and start from scratch; it\'s not to ignore all of the
mistakes that have been made, and lessons learned, along the way - rather
it\'s to accept the reality that no-one will EVER devise a rule system that
will please everyone, and that people will ALWAYS toss out the rules they
don\'t like and introduce rules that they do like.

Restructure the mechanics framework so that each part of the system can be
modularised and communicate to every other part of the system via
well-defined interfaces.  (Gee, who\'s a programmer then?)

The Universal World Profile, Universal Personality Profile and others of
their ilk, are already in place, are already used and accepted - let\'s make
*these* the interfaces between system modules.

Who cares what method you use for generating a character, a vehicle, a
starship, a world, or even a sector, providing that you can quantify
everything in a standard fashion.

Who cares how you determine the victor in hand-to-hand combat, how you skim
fuel from a gas giant, how you "nuke them from orbit", how you determine
weather patterns, how you pull numbers in the Assembly, how you remove a
TED from power, providing that you draw only upon data presented in a
Universal Profile and outcomes are reflected by changes to that profile?

Everyone talks the same language and problems, if they do arise, are
isolated to a single functional module which can be easity corrected
without major ramifications on the rest of the system.

If those that control the destiny of Traveller can create a framework into
which all past, present, and future rules sub-sets can be plugged, then the
primary bone of contention can be removed - people can play with whatever
sub-sets they are most comfortable with, and can play at whatever level of
detail is most appropriate (they can have a simple combat module but a
complex trading module, if that\'s what they want).  Once they have found a
combination of rules sub-sets that they are happy with, then they can get
on with enjoying the game itself, revelling in the *atmosphere* of a game
where the designers spend more time on background material, on sourcebooks,
on style, on flavour, than they do correcting mistakes in tables and design
sequences.

*) Create a framework.

*) Let the players come up with their own house-rules (they will anyway)
but provide a set of "interface guidelines" so that their house-rules can
be fully functional within the framework.

*) Allow all house-rules (sub-sets) to be freely distributed.  ("I\'ll just
connect to ftp://traveller.com/rules/modules and download PersonalCombat2,
Trading14, and VehicleDesign6 and we\'ll be on our way!")

*) Survey the Traveller community and based on the information gained from
"The Grand Survey" build a library of resource material covering what is
most popular, be it "Inside the Black Curtain", "Astrogator\'s Guide to the
Disapora Sector (Part 2)", "Traveller: The Trading Card Game", "The Long
Night", "The Civil War", or whatever.  The Grand Survey could be set up as
a web form, as well as a paper version distributed along with products, or
a file on a CD.

As far as the actual background to be used, let the players choose their own!

Rather than tying rules with setting, write all source materiel as a purely
informational resource only.  Let it read like a story, with no references
(or as little as possible) to mechanics at all.  FA$A did a great job with
their "House Books" for BattleTech - such a good job that playing
BattleTech is still fun (and if you want to know how NOT to design a combat
system, start with BT).

*) Divorce "setting" from "system", "background" from "mechanics".  That
way even novels become a resource, rather than being merely a reference.

*) Take pointers from Hollywood, who have, on occasion, written two (or
more) different conclusions to follow on from the first half of a
season-end cliff-hanger.  That way, the approach to a branch in the
timeline (did a rebellion happen or didn\'t it; did virus happen or didn\'t
it) would be covered in a single volume, with all details presented, but
the outcome unresolved.  In the last few pages, you can speculate on where
the story may go from there, to get people thinking, then discussing, then
providing feedback.  If you have statistically significant amounts of
people favouring a certain path, go with that one.  If it\'s pretty much a
tie, then you either officially branch the timeline (and provide a
sourcebook for each branch) or introduce a "heretofore unknown" element to
polarise opinion.  Ideally, the pre-branch volume would set things up so
that the event, once it happens (or not), will provide two (or more)
radically different outcomes - sufficiently different so that a "heretofore
unknown" element wouldn\'t need to be introduced.  In short - set up the
cliff-hanger and then let public reaction determine which way to go (and go
both, if that is what the public want).

*) Repeat The Grand Survey each year (or other appropriate period) to keep
tabs on the level of interest displayed in each branch in the timeline.
Once interest dwindles, cease further investment in that branch and
concentrate on those that are more popular (this is the only way to make
the whole approach economically viable).  But don\'t just cease and desist -
so that "the flame burns on" allow others to pick up where you left off
(after an appropriate cooling-off period) by passing support of the branch
to either another company, to an organisation of enthusiasts, or to the
public domain ("After December 31, 1999, you are hereby permitted to draw
apon all source material produced for the "Virus" branch of the traveller
timeline for your own purposes, be they personal, commercial or
otherwise.")  Of course, all branches include the "trunk" to which they
were attached, but the *action* is happening with the new branches (that
is, the publisher\'s income is being derived from new products being
released for active branches, rather than for "dead" branches, or the
"trunk" itself, so passing support on shouldn\'t affect income to any
appreciable extent).

Synopsis:

If the mechanics of Traveller are made and kept modular, people will be
able to configure their playing environment to suit them without having to
bend or break existing rules.  This is good for playability.

If interfaces between modules are well designed, players will be able to
design their own functional modules and make them available for all and
sundry to use.  This is good for flexibility.

If branches in the timeline take a direction desired by a majority of
players, then player support for the branch will not suffer.  This is good
for the future.

If support for branches is based on the results of regular surveys then
investment of resources can be directed to areas of return.  This is good
for the publisher.

Final Words:

Let\'s keep in mind the lessons we have learned:

1) All rules are broken, but some are more broken than others.

2) The atmosphere makes a game, the rules break it.

Divorce the rules from the setting.  Provide a framework which essentially
describes the interface between rules and the setting.  Let the players
design their own rules which the plug into the framework to interact with
the setting.  Concentrate on developing the settings that are the most
popular.  Ask for feedback before branching the timeline with a critical
event.

Alvin, I don\'t think that\'s quite right.  I think Marc wants to go
back to Traveller Classic with some updates and additions (like a
task system).  To be frank, it sounded a good bit like MT to me.
Clearly what it *won\'t* be is TNE.

I don\'t think so.  TNE still isn\'t CT or MT.  There are going to
be lots of people that continue to use the TNE system..and
material in their games.  There might come a time when "xboat"
becomes "traveller" and "traveller" becomes the "tne" list.  Or
if you\'re right there might end up being 3 lists! <g>

Is someone seriously considering doing this?  It would be a
pretty blatent copywrite violation if they did.  Tell me where
someone is doing this, so I can visit their site and personally
castigate them! <g>

  I admit to having designed a hovercraft for Milleniums End with it,
and a TL8 warbot battalion:) and to have used it to reverse engineer
real world aircrafts in order to make a (more) realistic aircraft damage
system for Dark Conspiracy.

  Vehicle design is good, spaceship design is good, airship/aircrafts/
rotary-wing craft design is (are?) good, as is large energy weapons,
sensors (but I think the Ladar TL\'s should be lowered by 1, compared to
the other sensors), etc etc.
  For small arms (well, anything below nukes) I use 3G^3, and for tac
missiles I use real world ISP and delta-v, and 3G^3 guidance and warhead
and put it in a tiny FF&S hypersonic airframe:)

  That could fit in a basic book. After all, The Traveller Book did

  The Mercenary/Merchant Prince/Scouts system (including extensions in

Mega Traveller) had you rolling for every year.

They are the sum of the level of skill and the attribute to which the skill

Using common sense! ;-)

Actually, simplest way is to subtract the controlling attribute from the
asset (that target nuber from the examples above), to get the TNE level
(different from asset, as attribute effects aren\'t included), and divide by
2 (for CT) or 1.5 (For MT)

TNE Rulebook. The controlling attributes anc complete skill list apeared in
the TNE Referee\'s Screen, as well.

> - What ever happened to the rule: Skills <= Int + Edu?

No involved in TNE. Dropped completely. Many GM\'s of my accquaintance (many
of them my former players) and I usually double the limit for MT games.

Survival Margin gives conversion into TNE Stats for MT characters; CT
Characters will cross over using it, but tend to be lesser skilled. Don\'t
bother yet; Marc Miller\'s revising again, and the new version should at
least maintain some character continuity (based upon his previous
statements). The switch to MT was easier, as you just brought the character
straight across if he\'d hit his Ed limit, or rolled special duty checks for
each term if not. It also added an experience system.

> - What is a Fusion Drive and how does it relate to CT.

the manuver drive is now a HEPlaR, or High Energy PLAsma Recombustion,
system, that needs hydrogen fuel as reaction mass. TNE Dropped the Thruster
Plates of CT/MT.

> - What is a G-turn?

30 minutes of 1G; either a measure of accumulated vector, vector change, or
fuel. In vectors, it is roughly 20000 kmh, or 1 10000km BL hex per 30
minute BL turn.

> - Whatever happened to Model a/b with x storage and y programs?

Dropped during MT ruleset. MT retained the Models; TNE/FF&S goes to a TL
and St or Fb or Flt (Standard, FIB, or Flight) models for each TL. Flight
computers are for vehicles only, not for starcraft.

Rules, tell everybody to buy those for the rules, or reprint them in
a neat, comprehensive, easy to use manual, but please (Marc, if you

22\'Main Hub Bearing Rebuilds Done Right\'

Smokey takes you step by step through this important part of any
Orrie rebuild or maintenence. Blueprints are included to machine the
hard-to-find outer rim seal sets, and to modify Ensign Industries
turret bearings for those of you who can\'t find original parts.

45\'Never Buy Jump Tapes Again\'

We install the Strange Trip Industries workstation interface.  Can a
dropout computer genius really run a starship off a desktop? They
call it a kit, but we find that lots of homebrewing is
necessary...this ain\'t a weekend project, folks.

62\'Why Spin?\'

Lots of people consider it heresy, but face it...CG is a lot more
convenient sometimes. We evaluate the \'New Grav\' CG adapter system
for use on that custom \'mot you have in your stable.

Features:

69Interview/Ship Profile. \'Furthur\'

TT talks, in depth, to Dunstan Englebart, architect of the STI
workstation interface.  How a renowned programmer/engineer dropped
out of a high profile career with Starpoint Systems, found peace and
happiness in a starfaring commune, and happened to free antique
shipowners from the jump tapes forever.

The \'Furthr\' is more than the wildly painted home of a odd bunch of
interstellar vagabonds...from the city bus sign riveted to it\'s
nose, to the garden taking up the starboard hamster cage, to the
sound system running throughout the ship, to the extended airfoils
on the tail, the \'Furthr\' is a monument to the flexibility and
modifiability of the basic Orrie design. We talk to Angus McCorran,
Dunstan Englebart and Viroshuggzh Agrizzh, the ship\'s master,
syestem\'s engineer, and chief engineer, respectively about life on
the \'Furthr\', and homebuilding starcraft.

83Interview/Ship Profile

Ramshalassan Vulkuri has won numerous concours d\'exellance awards
with his meticulously restored \'Salmoras\'. Here he tells TT of his
long infatuation with Vilani-designed ships, a brief tour of his
collection, and details of his restoration of the \'Salmoras\'.

Gleaming like the day she was launched, the \'Salmoras\' stands as an
outstanding example of the restorer\'s craft. First launched in the
very earliest days of the Imperium, in 238, she served the fledgling
Imperial fleet for 70 years.   Ramshalassan Vulkuri found her
languishing in a Spinward Marches junkyard, and bought her for next
to nothing. That began a 15 year odyssey to find, rebuild or
recreate the parts necessary to bring it back to the pristine
condition it is in today. Ramshalassan roamed throughout the
subsector poking around in junkyards, antique shops and surplus
depots in that time. The original Vland to Ershur jump tape set, he
says, was his greatest find.  It was in a dingy old thrift shop on
Gram...

        You\'re missing the point. Many people feel the TNE rules (myself
included) are a great improvement over CT or MT. Yes, I started with three
little black books. Then I moved along to the MT. Now I\'m relatively happy
with TNE. Each step, I felt, was an improvement over the others. I DON\'T
WANT TO GO BACK TO CT OR MT -- if I did, I\'d still be there.
        What I _do_ want is the current rules with a few tweaks. And scads
of background material and adventures. I don\'t have the time or energy (or
creativity, frankly) to come up with all that stuff. And the effort spent
updating and reissuing the rules would better be spent on that kind of stuff.

ATTENTION DGP AND TRAVELLER FANS:


Concerning DGP & Traveller:

I\'ve  been inundated  by queries  from fans  of Traveller and DGP
about DGP\'s role in Marc Miller\'s forthcoming Traveller odyssey.

Here  are  the  most  frequently  asked  questions,  and the most
interesting ones, followed by my responses:

    Will DGP aquire Traveller?

        No,  that is  not our  intention. Marc  Miller is back in
        town,  and  we   wholeheartedly  support  his  direction,
        wherever he may lead us.

    Will  DGP  publish  the  main  line  of  Traveller in its new
    incarnation?

        No. We\'ve got  too many irons in the  fire (including our
        own brand new game system,  and other huge projects - see
        below) to take on the whole darn thing.

    Will DGP produce Traveller goodies like it used to?

        The  precise details  haven\'t  been  worked out  yet, but
        tentatively,  "yes".  (Please  see  my comments following
        this FAQ.)

    Will DGP start up the Travellers\' Digest again?

        Let  me answer  this question  with another  question: Is
        this something you really really want?

    Will DGP make its past publications available?

        We  are looking  into the  best ways  to do this. (Please
        let  us  know  how  you  want  them:  Fried,  poached, or
        scrambled?  See below.)

    Will DGP  complete its unfinished  Traveller projects of  the
    past?

        It is too early to say. We\'d like to, but this depends on
        many  factors, such  as how  well they  would fit in with
        Marc\'s agenda for Traveller, how much demand for each one
        there is from YOU, and so on. :)

    What were DGP\'s unfinished projects?

        The Black Duke
        The Omnesium Quest
        Grand Explorations
        Battles of the Rebellion (with Marc Miller)
        World Builder\'s on Computer
        Second Survey on Computer
        Robots & Cyborgs
        MegaTraveller Alien #3 - Zhodani & Droyne
        MegaTraveller Alien #4 - K\'kree and  Hivers
        MegaTraveller Alien #5 - Humans and Nonhumans

        These  are  all  in  various  stages  of completion. Some
        barely entered the discussion stage, while others made it
        well into the writing stage.

    Will DGP make its library of Traveller publications available
    on CD-ROM?

        We\'re working on it. (See below)

    Will DGP ever finish A.I. (tm)?

        Hey, that\'s not a  Traveller-related question! Okay, I\'ll
        answer it  anyways. Yes, we  are working on  it. In fact,
        the  A.I.  (tm)  design   team  is  currently  recruiting
        kibitzers.


WHAT\'S NEXT?
----

BEFORE DGP can go into production of new material, we need to see
which way Marc Miller moves, and whether he decides that the next
step must be Traveller 4, or  whether he decides to retrench with
Classic Traveller, or Mega, or New Era.

In the meantime, DGP is limited in what we can develop and offer,
but  there may  be a  few  things  we can  put together,  without
conflicting with Mr. Miller\'s future designs.

Here are some ideas for  convenient gaming resources which DGP is
mulling over.  Please let me know  which of these you  would most
likely purchase if DGP made them available (in book form):

    THE GRAND TOUR -- All 21  episodes of the epic adventure from
    the  Travellers\'  Digest  Magazine,  compiled  into one book,
    complete   with  support   material,  and   of  course   with
    embellishments and enhancements.

    ADVENTURE  RESOURCE  --  All  other  adventures and scenarios
    published by DGP from its various publications and magazines,
    with relevant support material.

    TECHNOLOGY &  EQUIPMENT -- All  medical essays, technological
    essays, and  equipment descriptions, compiled  into one book,
    gathered  from  issues  of  Travellers\'  Digest Magazine, the
    MegaTraveller  Journal, and  from all  of DGP\'s  supplements,
    sourcebooks, and adventures.

    CAMPAIGN  RESOURCE --  A potpouri  of sociological  essays on
    Traveller cultures  and lifestyle, aliens,  history, regions,
    governments, agencies, Rebellion Factions, rules suggestions,
    and more. Arranged for easy reference.

If response is great enough, we\'ll submit a proposal to Marc.

;)


CD-ROM\'s and Such
----

We at DGP were delighted when  Marc expressed his desire to see a
Traveller  CD-ROM  created  --  We\'ve  been  wanting to put DGP\'s
entire archive of Traveller publications on CD-ROM for quite some
time  but decided  to hold  off on  development until the climate
surrounding Traveller changed. It finally has.

So, we\'ve started work on gathering, recompiling, converting, and
reformatting our  computer file versions  into some semblance  of
order, to  someday be placed on  one nifty disk for  your viewing
pleasure.

:)

This  will certainly  be a  long and  arduous project, which will
likely take us months to complete.

We\'ll need all the help we can get!

If you think  you can assist us with this  project, please let me
know.

Sincerely,

Roger Sanger
Digest Group Publications

        I\'m afraid I\'m going to have to disagree with you.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I, in turn, will have to disagree with your disagreement.

In any case, I think the point is moot because I don\'t think MM is going
to go with a system that he doesn\'t have the rights too & TNE is/was GDW\'s
"house" system. As far as I\'m concerned it was just another bad decision
by GDW to use the T2K system but now it seems that things will be better
now that MM\'s going back to his original system.

only one request: I truly hope that M. Miller WILL head the first law of
marketing: Listen to your customers.
I\'ve been in Europe for over three years (on the goverment plan), and
have had a real trouble keeping abrest of the world of traveller. I could get
the books, but it seemed that Challange magazine was late and getting later. I
think I still have a few more issues coming to me... Any one else? (please, no
flaming....)
I hope that all that are involved do take a little time to get together,
orginize, discuss the options, and formit opinions.
You have ideas with some merit. Please take the time to do it right.
Everyone hates paying for rushed junk. I, personally, think you have too many
plans, but you are the holder and the choice IS yours.
I would like to ask you a few questions:
1). Where will the new traveller take place and will you support the
other campaigns?
2). Do you plan a support magazine like Challange or JTAS? Traveler
Digest?
3). What it the time table of all this? A year? Two?
4). How far will the support branch out? A traveller home page?
Licenceing?
IMO, it should begin in the Spinward Marches (time frame is the key),
give it some support, and bring in the other products where there is a
following. I like the Reformation Coalition/Guild branch. It has the friction of
CT and could go either way. The Regency branch has potential and looks fun. It
shows the dawn of a new era and a yearning to grow.

Traveller (the GDW ERA) is going, but the Traveller (new NEW ERA) is only
dawning. Bring back the old spirit that the original had, and the rest will sell
its self.
I, for one, will be watching, reading, and giving my .02cr worth.
And, it feels good being back home in the US of A and back in Traveller.

    'body' => 'What\'s Wrong with Traveller

There\'s been a lot of discussions as to a "wish list" of options now that
GDW has gone (or is almost so) down the gurgler re the development of
Traveller, so I\'ll put in my 2 cents worth ... heresy though they may be!
My attitude is that, basically, when it came out in 1977 it was, purely
by dint of being the only SF RPG available, the best ... but that *that*
fact is all that it had going for it *at the time*. Since then, very little
has changed as far as the *game system* is concerned ... but the *background*
is the thing that makes it unique and worthwhile, nothing else.

So, what\'s wrong with it? Some of the things that *really* stick in my
craw are --

1) The absolutely, completely, *inexcusibly* unworkable Technology Level
system. Sorry guys, I\'ve followed the various arguments herein and I just
cannot accept that the system *as it exists* is worth a bent penny. Why?
Well, the areas that have been graced with TLs in the various iterations of
the TL charts make no sense.

For example, there is effectively *no difference at all* between the tech
needed to produce a TL/4 Cartridge Ammo weapon, a TL/5 Shotgun, a TL/6 Auto
Weapon-SMG-Autopistol, a TL/7 Grenade Launcher and, as far as the mechanical
components are concerned, a TL/10 Advanced Combat Rifle. Sorry, just makes
no sense.

Similarly, there is no real difference between the tech needed to produce
TL/3 Telegraph, TL/4 Telephone and TL/5 Radio & Radar, and TL/6 Television.

Environmental tech is also dubious. Cement structures not possible till  the
invention of Rifled Firearms ... tell it to the Romans! Cities in Rugged/
Desert (TL4), wellm I suppose it depends on what you mean by "cities", and\'what
you mean by "desert", but there are many old civilisations that managed large
cities (for the day) in desert areas, built around oases or other water
sources that had to be husbanded carefully. Ditto "cities" in "jungles".

Then look at those Tech levels that *arent* tech levels. Primiitive Fusion
Plants (TL9) through to Fusion Plants/80 liter minimum (TL16) are no more
deserving of separate TLs than TL4 Steam Engines and TL5 IC engines. If Fusion
engines are given 8 TLs, then Steam/IC engines are at least deserving of
several more "TLs" than they actually get.

I mean, for ghu\'s sake, "Mobile Worlds/Sublight" (TL20) is only one TL, and
one TL below "Mobile Worlds/Jumpspace"!!! Get a sense of proportion here!!!

The whole problem is in the areas that Tech is rated in, you can\'t rate Tech
by a what Terra has (or may in the future) do. Tech is not about inventions,
it\'s about *capabilities*.

More realistic tech areas would be -- Mechanical, Materials, Electrical,
Electronic, Computing, Biomedical, and Energy Generation.

And, at least as important as the above -- *Production* technology.

This brings us to the second major gripe --

2) The cost of items is ridiculous. TL/12 Air/Rafts cost more than TL/15
Air/Rafts. Just like a Model T in 1927 cost more than a Model T in 1917
(it didn\'t, of course, in neither absolute nor in relative terms). Tech
gets *less* costly as it matures -- relative to the wages of the people
producing it *and* in absolute terms. Ergo, TL12 Air/Rafts should cost
*less* than TL15 Air/Rafts -- a whole hell of a lot less! Or, perhaps (if
you want to get pedantic) TL15 *versions* of TL12 Air Rafts should cost
a whole hell of a lot less!

Part of the problem is that it is a game mechanic -- in the early days the
creators did not want PCs to get such useful items too cheaply (not that
ATVs were all that much more realistic an alternative, pricewise). But it
makes no sense, it\'s like Longbows being more expensive than swords in D&D.
No justification at all *in reality*.

The other part of the problem is, how do you relate 1 Cr of currency between
a TL12 (or any other TL) planet and a TL15 (say) planet. There is *no* easy
way of doing so. Think of it this way, you can live *very* cheaply on US$
in (say) China ... but not at US tech! If you want to live a US lifestyle *in*
China, you probably have to pay a premium *in some areas*. The reverse is also
true, a Chinese could not realistically expect to live *any* sort of life in
the US on Chinese yuan (or, to be more accurate, on a normal Chinese salary
*converted* to US$).

Not an easy problem to solve -- only TNE has come up with any sort of rule for
it all all, and there they assume that a TL12-TL15 character can save no more
than 5000 Cr per 4 year term. And that\'s cash *and* equipment. I would say
that there is no reason why any reasonable person could not save 20% of their
salaray per year ... ergo, 5000 Cr is 20% of 4 years salary, and this means
that they are earning 6250 Cr per annum! Compare this to the price of things
and see how ridiculous it is.

This problem with economics makes all the costings in FF&S *extremely*
suspect at the very least ... and that\'s just a small part of the whole
problem area!

3) Costs & Production: Think about it, we\'re talking about c5500 AD, right?
OK, there have been some "dark age" interludes (where some planets at least
kept space and starflight, so they didn\'t get knocked all the way back).
Yet it takes 12 months to produce a 100 ton Star/Spaceship! 9 months if its
a Scout/Courier, because they\'re so common. Hm, we can, *right now* produce
a Boeing 747 in, what, a day or so when the production line is fully geared
up? A 747 weighs around 170 tons *unloaded*.

Why so long? Sure, there are anti-Robot sentiments in the Imperium and the
Solomani Sphere, but surely we are looking at factories where things are
automated so much more than they are today. Thus, there seems no reason why
such a small vessel would take so long to produce. Sure, there may be
delays for the shipyard to work you into their schedule, but the actual
production time would be a few weeks at most (and that only for such relatively
nonstandard parts as the JDrives, *if anything at all*). Even the delays to
get into the waiting list would be minimal, especially for something like the
Scout/Courier which is in constant demand ... ditto the Far Trader/Fat Trade
and Subsidised Merchant.

For ghu\'s sake, we did better than this with Liberty/Victory ships in WW2, and
very well even with Warships! With automation that will exist at TL/15 we
cannot assume that there will be no improvements at all!

This automation of production has interesting implications for all prices in
the book as well. The effects of automation have been to increase overall
productivity and simultaneously decrease costs ... living standards (wages
and the like) rise ... yet the Imperium is strangely impoverished. Sort of
like a 5600 AD Stalinist Command Economy! (maybe that\'s the answer - the
Vilani dominated imperium like it that way!) Costs of items do not reflect
this factor at all in any way. A major flaw. The Imperium is obviously the
57th Century version of a handcraft and cottage industry level economy!

4) The Ship design rules, and FF&S in general, stink. I do *not* want to be
in the position where you need a spreadsheet and hours of complicated
tradeoffs as a requirement to be able to design a starship ... or anything
else, for that matter. High Guard was good enough for me and, I suspect,
for all the players that GDW must have lost over the years, as I presume
that if Traveller was still a major money-spinner that Chadwick and his
partner would not be winding up the company!

I (and *all* the members of the gaming groups that I have belonged to over
the years) thought that Megatraveller (and, now, FF&S) ship design rules
are an unmitigated disaster. Most simply refuse to acknowledge their existence
*at all* and use High Guard (or bootlegged copies thereof) ... though they
might use some of the stuff from MTrav to tweak High Guard designs a little
bit in a handful of cases. I mean, it stands to reason, if Traveller was
such a resounding success with MTRav and TNE design rules, they\'d still
be in business!

As for FF&S in general. Crap. Heresy! The system may well enable you to
design something similar to modern tech items, but the high tech stuff shows
no imagination at all. There\'s a lot of self-congratulatory rubbish about
how all the tech items make sense because they had to work that way, and
how certain technologies that are standard fare for SF are not allowed
because they aren\'t hard science. What rubbish. Look at predictions and
Science in the last hundred or so year ... for more than a decade or so
(at most) in the future they are not reliable at all. No Thruster Plate
tech in FF&S because it violates the Law of Conservation of Momentum! Well,
sure, it violates 20th century *understanding* of the physical universe, but
does that mean that 57th century understanding of the physical universe will
not have found out that ours is flawed and incomplete? Would Copernicus have
accepted Einstein any more easily than he was accepted by those who thought
his world view crazy heresy? Can we be certain that Einstein will not be
regarded as simple-minded and incomplete in 100 years, let alone 3000 odd?

The answer is, quite obviously, *no*. I would suggest that it is inherently
impossible to have a system such as FF&S that can really be regarded as
acceptable ... it will always have to be redesigned every five or ten years
to keep it "advanced". I mean, look at GDW\'s original Advanced Combat Rifle
of 1977 ... pretty much like the H&K G-11; now they are calling ETC ammo
"state of the art", and it probably won\'t ever get off the ground any more
than the turretless tanks in TW:2000 did. Nope, design systems for space
and starships are about as much as you can reasonably hope to do, and only
on the level of High Guard. For the rest, well, my WAG designs are just as
likely to be "realistic" as any that FF&S can come up with!

5) Megatraveller: Task Resolution -- I am surprised that there is *anyone*
out there who thinks that the Task Resolution system of MTrav was anything
but a complete waste of space. Never used it, don\'t know anyone who did (or,
if they did, who did for very long), longwinded, overly complex, and generally
unuseable. Even Classic Trav was better.

As for TNE, the main problem is that it is TW:2000 in alll ways. Now, don\'t
get me wrong, I think that TW:2000 is a neat little system, but it should
have been presented with the *roleplaying* elements to the fore in TNE. I
suspect that one of the reasons that TNE hasn\'t succeeded is because it
forces people to play a combat wargame version of an RPG ... and most people
are attracted to Traveller because of the richness of its roleplaying
background. You only have to look at the Space Vikings and Regency Material
published to date ... heavy on the firepower and military action. Even MTrav
and the Civil War didn\'t do that.

Well, there\'s a lot more, but that\'s all for now.

Mostly true.  I think the ability to design stuff is important, and that
impacts rules, but other than that I agree.

Not always.  I think the assumption is made that we are talking about
equivalent capabilities of the objects in question, i.e., the air rafts are
the same, but the tech level of the factory producing it is different.  The
first Walkman-type tape players were large, bulky and expensive.  Now, for
less money, I can get something half the size, with more features and better
sound.  Something that used to be sold by salesmen in the stereo section is
now sold hanging from steel pegs in plastic wrap.

So, in conclusion, the TL system is only 90% broken.  <grin>

I would like to see a system somewhere in the middle, with optional rules for
greater or lesser complexity.  Anybody remember the Naval Architects Manual
from Star Cruiser?  That didn\'t seem so bad...

I agree, these are problems.  I was sorry to see thruster plates go, for
exactly the same reasons.  Sure, we couldn\'t build thruster plates today, we
don\'t even have a theory as to how they work, but who knows what is possible
several thousand years from now.  As long as there are some limits on the
technology preventing it from being used as magic (unlike the warp engines or
transporter on the $tar$hip Enterpri$e, for example) I\'m happy.

I think there was a mistake made in differentiating between _science_ and
_technology_.  Be grounded _in_ current science, but don\'t be grounded _by_
current technology.

But, if I remember correctly, weren\'t thruster plates included in FF&S as an
option, just like stutterwarp?  The neat thing about RPGs is that you cxan
change the rules you don\'t like.  I personally got the impression that a large
chunk of the problems with FF&S could be solved to most people\'s satisfaction
by fiddling (say, by dividing the resulting weight by 2 and multiplying the
endurance by 2).

Yup.  I don\'t mind that stuff, but there should have been more non-military
stuff.

Would that be _the_ Space Opera, done by FGU in the late 70s?  If so, let me
congratulate you on the effort.  I know a lot of people who played Traveller
with the space combat rules totally replaced by the rules from SO.  I still
think it has a lot to offer...

Since there is all sorts of discussion about the rebirth of Travller, I have
done some thinking (along with everyone else) about formats, and I have a
question:

What do people think of the "Star Wars Adventure Journal" concept?

If you haven\'t seen it, it is a 288-page, trade-size, book-quality companion
to the Star Wars RPG published 8 times a year by WEG.  It includes fiction, a
regular columns on equipment, real news, storyline "news", etc. -- sort of a
JTAS on steroids.

I think this format (like the earlier JTAS format) has a lot of potential, and
I think including fiction will both help to flesh out the background and
attrack non-RPGers -- after all, the more people that subsidize it, the more
money Marc Miller has to spend on new supplements.  Every so often the best of
the supplements could be gathered in subject specific books (tech manual,
etc.) to supplement the original release and support books.

The advantage of such a system is that no one has to wait for the specific
supplements, yet all the information will eventually be collected in one
location.

One disadvantage is that carrying all the stuff you might need might get a
little harder. A second disadvanatage, which I think can be easily avoided
with discipline and forethought, is that it promotes "Star Fleet Battles
Syndrome", where every supplement modifies the existing rules structure.

[Of course, what I _really_ want is Alvin Plummer\'s series of 400 page
supplements...]

Someone said that White Wolf is doing well because they put out tons of
background and don\'t worry about rules.  One of the reasons they can do
this is that the rules are bonehead simple, and that\'s the way it should
be.  With some tweaking I think a revised MT rules set would be excellent.<<

Simplicity is good, but too much of anything can be a bad thing.  While
Traveller\'s rich background is its most admirable feature, one of the other
things it\'s had going for it, at least since the days of MegaTrav, is the
attempt to be realistic.  Traveller should continue to be a hard-science game,
with plenty of speculative sci-fi goodies thrown in for good measure.

I wouldn\'t be offended if MM and crew simplified the combat system a bit, but
reverting to the use of one\'s STR, END and CON for "hit points" is not
acceptable.  Neither is the too-cut-and-dried system of MegaTrav.  Too easy to
get killed without any medical miracle recourses.

I know some of you probably conduct great roleplaying sessions or maybe even
whole campaigns in which not a single shot is fired.  Through CT, MT and TNE, I
must admit that some of the best sessions we\'ve had involved negotiation and
interaction over gunplay, but IMO a good firefight once in awhile makes the game
fun.  Searching far and wide for interstellar botanic samples or engaging in the
Traveller version of "My Dinner with Andre" is not my idea of a good time.

To that end, I\'d like to see a good realistic combat system put in place.  To
date, TNE has presented the most realistic one.  It\'s a bit cumbersome, but
perhaps if some of the dead weight were shed, it would be successful.

>>Also, I LOVE the idea of FF&S LITE.<<

Me too.  Go easy on the technical explanations and just set up a good
comprehensive, easy-to-use tech creation system.

Well, phil, that there would alienate 2/3 of all traveller players I know.

It\'s simple, detailed enough and easy. It takes me 10 minutes to get people

Oh, and phil, if you dislike Traveller\'s rules THAT much, why not find
something you DO like, and use it instead. Basically it sounds like the
only thing about traveller (any edition) is High Guard and the Background
Material, and would rather trash tthe rest of the system.

I think that to some extent, "easy to use", and "comprehensive" are mutually
exclusive.  On the other hand, I think a FFS Light is very possible.  As
I see it, an FFS Light system would be for creating complex systems out
of premade subsystems.  Much like building a ship in HG using standard
bays, turrets, etc..  The nitty gritty tech needs to have some set of
guidelines, and these, I think, need to be more detailed.  But if the
systems are done right, those who don\'t want/have the detailed rules,
just use the plug-ins, and gear-heads can make new plug-ins for a new
JTAS publication.

Having a system that gives results in MJs, MWs,l etc., then converts
them via a fudge factor to a damage value, g-turn, armor value, whatever
is a good thing.  I can take a 150MJ laser and use a different
coefficient to get the damage value if a different combat system is
chosen... also, having a feel for how things are produced for the games
as it stands makes designing unknow technologies easier and more
consistant (assuming the design rules are consistant to begin with----so
we\'re not talking off the shelf FFS for some systems :-)

An improved FFS needs to have the extremes played out before publication
so that technologies extant in the traveller universe make sense as they
are used.  Lasers in TNE are a great example of this since none of the
published warships makes any sense given the laser design rules in FFS.
GDW actually did the right thing in making more "historical" ship
designs, but didn\'t play around with FFS enough to notice that the
published ships were obsolete given unrestricted laser weapons.

Sounds interesting.  I always liked JTAS.  Hell, JTAS (with the addition
of a little art, and the news service (combined with a "The way things
were 100, 1000, whatever years ago" section to support the other time
periods)) could be done frequently just with stuff from the TML.  I\'d
make ships, whatever in the public domain if it would help get a new
traveller off the ground.

Another reason, IMO, for something like FFS to gell up some of the
technologies.  Also, I prefer rules additions to be optional rules that
sit on top of existing rules.  It seems to me that many rules additions
(if not all) can be done in such a way that they don\'t supercede
previous rules.

    'body' => 'Dear Marc Miller,

Thanks very much for being willing to listen to Traveller players about what we
would like to see in Traveller.  It is really good to know that you are
involved once again in Traveller, and I hope this go-round exceeds all
expectations for both success and quality.  I saw a recent post from you where
you asked what books/material we would like to see come out of you new
Traveller effort.  Here is my take on it.  Sorry about the length.

Note - I have used "Third Imperium" throughout this document, but TNE basically
put paid to that organization.  If that premise is kept, simply replace Third
Imperium with whatever successor state seems appropriate.

1.  The Basic Game
A three-volume set (I\'m a sucker for tradition) consisting of a Players Book, a
Setting Book and a GM\'s Book.
The Player\'s book would have the character generation rules and career
guidelines, melee and fire combat rules, and basic equipment prices and
descriptions.  It would also have a general library of data for the Third
Imperium, some historical information about the setting, an overall map of the
Imperium, and maybe some general info on the society, culture, nobility and
corporations of the Third Imperium.
The Setting Book would focus on a portion of the third imperium, with
background and history, information on some alien races from the local area
(with some basic character generation rules), career rules for jobs specific to
the area, and maps and statistics for one sector (the Spinward Marches -
Tradition rears its ugly head once again).  The format of this Setting Book
could be duplicated for other sectors, which would be sold separately.  Since
all of the Player and GM info is in the other books, the Setting Book format
would allow players and GMs to buy multiple sectors without duplicating data.
The GM book would have rules for creating worlds and star systems, mercantile
rules, starship and vehicle combat rules, and a simplified system for designing
ships and vehicles.  There would also be an expanded listing of goods and
services, including material not normally available to the characters.
Finally, this book would cover Psionics.

2.  Advanced Equipment Book
A book or boxed set consisting of equipment design rules for creating new
vehicles, starships, robots, weapons, etc.  The book would include some sample
designs, and at least one sample walk-through of each design sequence.  This
book could include a expanded equipment price list.  All equipment in all of
the Traveller books would be designed via this book, and would follow the rules
and strictures of the design sequence involved.  And finally, all of the design
sequences should come with a stable of "predesigned components" for those of us
who do not always want to play number cruncher.  I like to have the option of
being quick and using predesigned material, but I also very much like being
able to design things from scratch.  Having these predesigned components would
give us the flexibility of the FF&S when desired, and the simplicity of CT/MT
when desired.

3.  Advanced Starship Set
A boxed set consisting of the expanded ship construction rules (same as those
in the Advanced Equipment Book), a more detailed starship combat system, and a
more simplified starship combat system to be played as a tabletop game,
allowing faster resolution of starship battles regardless of ship size.  I
would suggest that this set come with a book called "Naval Forces of the
Imperium" which details the Imperial Navy organizations and structures,
standard Imperial Navy ship designs and some additional historical info.  Also,
the book should have some vastly expanded naval careers.  Info on the navies of
other states could be presented in an abbreviated format in this boxed set,
with the possibility of being expanded in books specific to those states later
(A Zhodani book, etc).

4.  Advanced Combat Set
A boxed set with mass combat rules, conversion rules for vehicles/equipment
from the Basic and Advanced Rules, and maps and counters.  The set would also
need organizational info on some Imperial, mercenary and other military
forces.  I would suggest that this set come with a book called "Armed Forces of
the Imperium" which details Imperial Army and Marine organizations and
structures, standard Imperial military equipment and some additional historical
info.  Also, the book should have some vastly expanded military careers.  Info
on the military of other states could be presented in an abbreviated format in
this boxed set, with the possibility of being expanded in books specific to
those states later (A Zhodani book, etc).

5.  Exploration and Colonization Sourcebook
A book with rules and adventure ideas for exploring and colonizing new sectors,
subsectors and worlds.  This book would include vastly expanded career info for
the Scout Service, standard IISS ship and equipment designs, and expanded world
generation/description rules (including cultural info).

6.  Mercantile Sourcebook
A book with rules and adventure ideas for buying and selling in an interstellar
marketplace.  This would include expanded and enhanced interstellar trade
rules, rules for detailing a world\'s economy (maybe duplicated from the
Exploration and Colonization book above), vastly expanded career info for
merchants, standard or common mercnatile ship designs, and expanded info on
Imperial megacorporations and their smaller competitors.

7.  Atlas of the Imperium
I loved that book.  I would have liked more detail, though; not necessarily all
of the UPPs, but a page of info for each sector detailing the sector and
subector capittals and leadership, plus some tidbits of info about each sector
(like the subsector blurbs in the old Spinward Marches and Solomani Rim books.
Basically, each sector would get two pages; one of map, and one of background
information, which would make it trwice as large as its predecessor.

8.  Setting Books
More books detailing other sectors of the Third Imperium.  The Setting Book
would focus on a portion of the third imperium, with background and history,
information on some alien races from the local area (with some basic character
generation rules), career rules for jobs specific to the area, and maps and
statistics for one sector.   This book could be done with each subsector
getting its own page, with the facing page having the UPPs and other
interesting info about the sector.  That would be 32 pages.  The book woul also
have a full-page sector map on both inside covers; one showing world names and
starports, and the other only showing such info for high-population worlds
(like the old Atlas of the Imperium, but no ugly square grids!).  There would
also be a consolidated listing ot the sector\'s UPPs, and a section covering the
additional historical, background, career and alien info noted above.  The
gatefold could have a two-page reproduction of the sector map as well (like the
5th Frtontier War campaign book).  All in all, this could be done in 48-64
pages.

9.  Alien Books
Books detailing Alien Races.  The book would have expanded career info for the
alien race, historical and cultural info, equipment peculiar to the race
(ships, vehicles, weapons, whatever).  It should also have an equipment price
list in monetary units common to the alien race, and changes to economic,
trade, exploration or colonization rules that would be warranted for that race,
plus expanded info on the armies and navies of the alien race (and their
equipment).  Finally, the book could also include one sector as described
above.  The inside covers should be used for anatomical studies like those in
the old GDW Aliens books (I loved those drawings!  Was that Tom Peters?).  If
the book included a sector, it could be done in a 128-page book, conceivably.
Without the sector, it could fit in a 74-76 page book.  There would be one each
for the Zhodani, Aslan, Vargr, K\'kree, Drone and Hivers.   Some of the smaller
races (Darrians, Vegans) could be covered in the Setting Books specific to
their sectors, rather than having an entire Alien book devoted to them.

10.  The Imperial Sourcebook
The book I always wished was around.  This book would detail the Imperial
government, the interaction of the nobility and the bureaucracy, the various
ministries and offices of the Imperium, the covert and law enforcement
agencies, and the laws of the Imperium.  The book would have expanded career
rules for various Imperial jobs (noble, bureaucrats, secret agents, etc), and
would also have an expanded history of the Third Imperium.


I\'ve been playing Traveller since 1982, and being the greedy sort I\'ve tried to
get pretty much everything that has been published, at least by GDW.  As you
can see, a lot of the things I have detailed are very analogous to Classic
Traveller or T:TNE products:  Item 2 is basically Fire, Fusion and Steel;  Item
3 is a sort of mixture of Brilliant Lances, Battle Rider and High Guard; Item 4
is a mixture of FF&S, Mercenary and Striker I and II; Item 5 is basically
Scouts, the DGP Grand Survey/Grand Census books and the World Tamers Handbook,
etc.  I think a lot of good material is already out there, and you could really
accomplish a lot by simply trying to combine it together in new ways, editing
it for clarity and consistency.  That might make this Herculean task before you
a little less Impossible (maybe even downgrading it to Ridiculously Difficult).

I really enjoyed Classic Traveller.  I was disappointed with the quality of the
MegaTraveller material, but still enjoyed the game.  I was absolutely torn by
the New Era, though:  I really liked the new character ad combat rules (even
better than Classic Traveller, to be honest) but I truly loathed the
background.  I have seen that many people felt the TNE system was too
militaristic or wargame-like, but I don\'t agree that is true; a campaign is as
militaristic as you want it to be.  This seems like a problem with people
confusing the Background with the Rules.  The TNE character rules are simply
that; character rules that allow a player to meet, speak, drink with, punch,
shoot, chat up, connive or verbally dazzle NPCs and other players.  I do think
the TNE background was too combat-centric, but that did not bother me too much,
as I was using my own (continuing Third Imperium) background instead.  I have
plenty of combat using the TNE rules, but I have plenty of character
interaction and roleplay as well.  Blaming a set of character rules for some GM
being unable to come up with noncombat adventure situations seems a bit silly.

As for the future of Traveller, I hope you move forward using the TNE rules
set.  The main reason for this is Fire, Fusion and Steel.  This is to me the
most amazing sourcebook, and it has become my number one favorite aspect about
Traveller.  Most SF RPGs let you design starships, and many allow you to design
vehicles, but how many let you design battle armor, or lasers, or fire
directors?   I know some of the results are less than realistic, but it is a
Science Fiction GAME, not a science class.  My only complain with FF&S is that
you are limited in what can be designed; no sea vessels, no robots, no really
high-tech things like teleporters, etc.  However, its still a damn good
starting point.   If you were to decide to go more with a CT/MT system, I hope
you would take the time to convert FF&S to this new system.  I know it is a lot
of extra work, but the benefits of that sourcebook far outweigh the
inconvenience of conversion.

I hope you\'ve found something useful in all of this.  If there is anything I
can do to help (or clarify the statements above), don\'t hestitate to ask.  I
imagine some of my opinions will be feuling another TML flame war anyway, so a
response from you would not hurt much.

Thanks you, and Good Luck

I think that if you released new Adventures you support all three games
because all the backround and story will be the same, you will just need
three sets of tech info. hell the same could be said about any new
source book you release.

This comes down to a few extra pages, that please all partys (i hope).

Stuff on FFS Light:

>- More drop in weapons  - spinal mounts and bays, and some of our non GF lasers

Makes sense.  In my personal system, I include a line for the PP volume
required to support a given weapon at max ROF.  In this way I get the PP
volume figured out as I go.

> - Simplified thruster units - Including basic fuel reserves and definitely
> based on displacement not mass. (we could increase the thrust required per

At TL 14-14 the drives (Mdrive plus the PP to support it) use 1.55% of
displacement per g, at TL15 it\'s 0.95% per g.

At all TLs, 50 g-turns is 22.32% of total displacement.

> - Simplified Ship\'s systems - All Life support, controls added together

1.8% of displacement works above TL10 (LS and Grav Comp).

Quarters run under 5% of displacement for all ships in all versions of
traveller that I looked at in a quick survey (including FFS ships!).

>- Sensors arranged in 4-5 \'packages\' - eg Merchant, Fighter, Light battleship,
> Heavy Battleship, Survey...

Cost is the major factor in sensors.  I have a few of these done up by
TL already.

That or just a table with TL as a heading, then type as a sub-heading.
Due to the cut offs of sensors they\'re be a lot of TL12-13 Blah blah.
TL14-15, blah blah... you get the idea, there won\'t need to be entries
for each TL.

> - Plug in options for carried vessels eg Fighter, Lifeboat, Landers (some of

Already pretty easy (I assume that FFS Light can be as complicated as HG
if needed.

For major ships I don\'t even bother.  I use 5% displacement for crew,
and write down a ball park figure for description based on CT/MT crew
levels of similar ships.

This doesn\'t matter to me since for BR you don\'t need damage locations
at all.  For detailed ships, I do real FFS.  On the other hand, assuming
you have the sub-systems premade, doing full FFS only involves any math
for the hull.  None of it is complicated anyway.  It suffers more from
lack of clarity than difficulty, IMO.

On the other hand, since player sized ships are the only ones I really
detail out, standard hulls make sense.  I cost out standard types at a
much reduced price since it always seemed like Free Traders were too
expensive to make ends meet.  If the hulls are standard, and you have
sensors, controls, and weapons premade, doing a ship is all plug and
chug.

Seriously though folks, my vote is definately for a MT 2nd edition, ie
with a bit of proofreading and streamlining.  FF&S lite also sounds
like the way to go.  I like the idea of layered rules-sets offering the
ability to pick and choose a level of complexity for the different modules
of the rules.  However I cannot stress enough that this sort of system has
 to be designed from the onset, otherwise we will end up with a set of
overlapping, unmanageable and conflicting references a la CT. (I still

According to GDW late last week, it is unsure as yet what will happen with it.
GDW is giving people credit towards merchandise for their remaining Challenge

I certainly hope someone buys it.  While I have some problems with it, it is
the only dedicated cross-platform mag outthere.

    'topic' => ' Traveller\'s direction',
    'body' => '     There\'s been a lot of interesting discussion about the direction of
     Traveller.  I\'d just like to voice my opinion now.

     FEEL

     I would like a simple system that has the right "feel".  Some systems
     just feel right for the game or genre (frex, I think the system for
     Call of Cthulhu is very good for that game).  For some reason, I
     didn\'t mind the Bushido system for combat where you had to roll an
     amount under your weapon skill rating that equaled or exceeded your
     opponent\'s armour rating, yet I hated the D&D system of rolling a
     target number or higher on a table cross referenced by your level (&
     thus weapon skill) and your opponent\'s armour, despite the fact that
     both systems were functionally identical.  I\'m not sure how you impart
     a certain feel to a rules system (other than perhaps by the art &
     writing style), but I know it\'s important.

     EMPHASIS

     I would like the emphasis to be on something other than combat.
     That\'s not to say that I think the combat system should not be well
     done or accurate.  On the contrary, I like combat systems that produce
     accurate results without being too complex (I speak from the
     experience of experimenting using Phoenix Command as the combat system
     for a MT game - accurate? yes. fast? noooooo).  I can just about cope
     with Millenium End\'s combat system, because although it\'s quite
     complex, my players know they have a good chance of dying or being
     crippled, so they only engage in gunplay as a last resort.
     Back to my original point, I think the emphasis in TNE was too much on
     using force.  The whole star viking, smash & grab thing was a bit too
     military for me.  I can play T2000 if I want to go and "kick ass", or
     Cyberpunk if I want to get my ass kicked (hi Dave).  A game should
     concentrate on elements of its genre.  Ars Magica concentrates on
     magic and Mythic Europe; Call of Cthulhu on the Mythos and the roaring
     twenties; Star Wars on weird aliens and heroic action.  Shouldn\'t
     Traveller be about space travel, interstellar trade, high technology,
     aliens and vast star spanning empires (hey, sounds like CT to me ;-))?

     I realise that much of this has been said by others.  I\'m merely
     putting my slant on things and hopefully provoking more discussion
     (and maybe influencing MM\'s thinking ;-)).

     Liam

The Regency Combat Vehicle Guide includes this chart, along with FF&S stats
for the vehicles presented in Striker II.  Briefly,  the crossed lines
through the box are infantry, an oval in the box is armor, a single dot in
the box is artillery, a capital E turned on its side are engineers.  A line
under the box indicates the unit is equipped with contra-grav vehicles.

Unit sizes are on top of the box.  One dot: squad, two dots: section (often
ommited), three dots: platoon, one line: company, two lines: battalion,
three lines: regiment, one x: brigade, two x: division, three x: corps,
four x: army.

This

>Striker II.  Am I missing something?

It wasn\'t there, but here are the basics, based on U.S. Army pattern.  A
squad is usually led by a Staff Sergeant (E-6), a platoon by a Lieutenant
(O-1 or 2) assited by a Sergeant 1st Class (E-7), a company is commanded by
a Captain (O-3) assisted by an XO (O-2) and a First Sergeant (E-8).  All
higher units have an Executive officer of one grade lower and a Sergeant
Major (E-9) with them.  Battalion: Lt. Colonel, Regiment: Colonel,
Brigade: Colonel or Brigader General,  Division:  Major General (2 star),
Corps: Lt. General (3 star),  Army: General (4 star).

Note that the term "Army" as used above does not refer to the entire force
of men under arms.  It is a distinct organization inside the larger U.S.
Army.

Hope this helps, if you have more questions, feel free to email me..

        You\'re missing the point. Many people feel the TNE rules (myself

        What I _do_ want is the current rules with a few tweaks. And scads

I agree with you.  In general the TNE rules are better written and have
benefited from years of "playtesting" through CT and MT.  I know some people
feel that TNE is little more than a military game, but it does not have to be
that way.  The "crawling your way out of the dark ages" setting will tend to
lend itself to more military campaigns and TNE has a lot of work invested
into those type of rules and suggestions, but there is no reason that a TNE
game has to concentrate there.  The rules are just as capable of handling
non-military role-playing and are in many ways simpler than the earlier
systems.  A lot of it depends on what the GM and his players want in their
game.

to hurt TNE was MegaTraveller! many of the game shop owners I talked to (about
20; admittedly a limited sample) were leery of stocking it because of the SLOW
sales they experienced on MT. Once we explained that they were different games,
they started carrying it. Overall, it seemed that TNE\'s sales weren\'t bad, just
not good enough; for that you would have needed another seller on the level of

1. In response to:
Contents from "The Tender", a quarterly magazine for Antique

Spinward Marches.

Just one word...bwwwaaahhhhaaahhhhaaahhhhaaahhhhaa ( to quote Commodore
Bwanna! )
That was hilarious (I hope it was meant so B-) )!!!

2. In response to -- The absolutely, completely, *inexcusibly* unworkable
Technology Level system.

        I agree partly with Phil MacGregor\'s argument, and the response by
Christopher Weuve.  TL doesn\'t exactly work, and bre4aking it out into
multiple systems would be better.

3. In response the the general BASHING of TNE rules, along with the dislike
of FF&S, I have these pearls of wisdom to offer.

        3.1 - I for one like the TNE rules.  I even like the Task Resolution
system.  I like the fact that a character can not have a skill, and has a
chance to perform the skill.  I also like the asset with a firm belief that
statistics play a part in performance.  Otherwise ANYONE could play
professional sports!  I would puch to use percentiles instead of D-20s, and
please NO D-6 rolls.  I HATE 2-12 ranges!

        3.2 AS for the FF&S bashing.  I can agree with you on this to a
certain extent.  I do like the ability to customize to the detail that FF&S
goves me.  However I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of
starships I have designed with it.  I have a 3" binder someplace full of
starships, vehicles, etc I designed under Book 2 and High Guard.  My
suggestion would be this. It also BTW: solves the ship contruction problems.
We can use the basics of FF&S to design components that fit into vehicles,
starships, etc.  For example.  You want to build a starship.  It will be a
custom built hull (most ships are anyway).  However, you decide you want to
get Jump 3 performance.  So the contractor building it plops in a basic
component that gives your rated 50 or 100 ton hull increment.  It may waste
tonnage, but its guarranteed to work for your ship.  Then you put in plain
vanilla sockets, and the weaponry for them.  Computers are next, Life
support etc.  All standard components (e.g.) Buy a Gigaserver 9000 rated to
handle a up to a 1000 ton ship, or simply allocate xm^3 per person for Life
Support.  Finally it comes time for the power plant.  Instead of custom
building a powerplant for the exact MW req for your ship, you purchase
plants in 10, 25, 50, 100 MW increments.  Gee this does sound a bit liek old
book 2.  This BTW does solve the ship building time problem.  Figure the
time to build the hull, then to git it out.  Everything else is standard.  I
would suspect that a competent shipyard could put out a Free Trader with a
few custom mods in about 2-3 weeks.  Military ships would most liekly NOT
use this ssytem, they would have most of their stuff custom built, but it
would not necesarily be higher tech (smaller, lighter, etc).  MilSpec is
built to rougher standards, and is often 2-5 times larger/heavier than CivSpec.

AGGGHHHHH I have rambled forever!!!!!!

but the rules don\'t even justify the trees being cut down to make the paper
to print them out.  It isn\'t even an argument about realism, those rules

right!  Ducking in combat doesn\'t necessarilt make you harder to hit, forget
covering fire, and try explaining how it is harder to learn your fourth
language than your first, and how its as easy to learn Fluent Lithuanian as
it is learning basic computer operations.

WW tapped into a market of potential gamers that used to hang around the
periphery of RPGs.  By making games set in "our" modern world so that the
players need to know very little about the game.  They don\'t need to learn
mechanics as there really aren\'t any.  All they have to do is ham it up
acting out their personal fantasies.  (Don\'t get me wrong, I am not against
any of this.)  The storyteller is responsible for telling the story, and
using the rules.  As a result, Rules that are easy to learn, but don\'t
always work for experienced gamers.  I have always disliked games that don\'t
allow someone who actually knows something about what their character is
doing (Former Military playing a merc, Computer Programmer playing a hacker)
from being able to use some of their professional knowledge.

As for military RPGing, I have this to say.  If you don\'t want fighting in
your game, fine,  However, I rather like to blow up things in my RPGs.
Perhaps it keeps me from blowing up things in real life! heheheheeheh B-).
Don\'t begrudge me a rule system that lets me fight it out when I want to,

I agree with a lot of this, but I\'d just like to point out that most of
the ideas about FFS are already in FFS.  The problem with FFS is that
you have to custom design every damn system, right?  I don\'t think
that\'s the problem.  I think it\'s that they didn\'t bother making some
really useful tables of pre-made sub-systems.  Now that I have a couple

FFS design isn\'t too much harder than HG.  BUt that\'s still a design
problem of FFS (the jump all over the book path to creating a design

Here, here!  I totally agree.  Granted now that I\'ve gone through and
done a bunch of designs I\'ve got lots of plug-n-chug components ready
to go.  I think that the real "lite" part of FFS Lite is just creating
tables with all of this stuff already to go.

You know, stuff like Roger Myhre\'s standard laser list (speaking of
which does anyone know where I can get another copy, mine\'s getting
worn out), premade MFD\'s with laser and ems sensors figured in, etc...

Break down drive tables to give info on vol per tonne of thrust per 1,
10, and 100 displacement tons.  Then you can easily figure out req\'d
volume, fuel, etc, simply by multiplying this figure out by your hull
size (and you can interpolate odd sizes using this).  The same could
be done for jump drives and what not.  Also, include the alternative
technologies in said tables (makes it much, much easier to reference
that way).

Hey Merrick, do you think Marc will let us help him with this one?  8)

One point about plug-in weapons...

The problem with the plug-ins produced in BL, FFS, etc. was that they
seemed to be arbitrary (in terms of DE, and size).  I never agreed with
the approach that they should design the rules, then see what
technologies get developed.  This is fine for a game that is just
starting, but not for one with a rich history.  Since lasers don\'t ever
get above factor 9 in HG (I would treat batteries as larger weapons, not
groups of smaller ones at times in my HG designs) the TL*50 DE limit
makes sense in this regard.

I\'m just harping on the lasers as an example, though. A decision needs
to be made regarding what technologies are best for what.  The people
living in the high TL society have had thousands of years to figure out
what trechnologies work for what.  (Can\'t you just see a weapons
designer in the Regency smacking his forehead and saying, "Hey, all we
need to do is make a *big* laser and all other weapons are obsolete!  I
wonder why nobody thought of it in the last few thousand years?" :-)

Back to my first point... they\'re arbitrary in FFS, but it only bothers
me because the rules allow better ones.  All we need to do is make it so
the rules duplicate the range of CT weapons (though I\'m willing to give
plasma/fusion weapons a miss for ships).

You\'re right, Blair.  After all, the task system, based on a D20, is just as
good as, if not better than, that of MegaTraveller.  And furthermore, TNE has
more skill types to choose from for non-military TNE campaigns.  I think this is
why many people have chosen to convert to TNE rules, but conduct classic era
campaigns.

I find a great deal of ease in selecting difficulty levels and ascribing tasks
to the PCs in my group with the D20 system.  Checking out the scene of a murder?
Use Investigation asset, difficulty level difficult, and roll to determine the
success of a forensics test.  Trying to bust into an encrypted computer network?
Use Computer asset, formidable.  It\'s not _all_ guns and mayhem.  Especially not
in a Regency campaign.

The "military-based system" argument just doesn\'t hold water.

Understood.  Of course, I still like it, but I actually *like* making
complicated tradeoffs: more to the point, I buy Traveller for solo pleasure,
and one of the things I get a kick out of is designing ships.  Those who
actually USE the game in a role-playing envorinment may indeed demand
something a lot quicker.

:
: One point about plug-in weapons...
:
: The problem with the plug-ins produced in BL, FFS, etc. was that they
: seemed to be arbitrary (in terms of DE, and size).  I never agreed with
: the approach that they should design the rules, then see what
: technologies get developed.  This is fine for a game that is just
: starting, but not for one with a rich history.  Since lasers don\'t ever
: get above factor 9 in HG (I would treat batteries as larger weapons, not
: groups of smaller ones at times in my HG designs) the TL*50 DE limit
: makes sense in this regard.

I\'m sorry.  I did have the TL*50 limit in mind when I wrote the
previous statement.  I guess I\'m just so used to thinking of lasers
with a TL*50 limit (it gets ingrained into you on gdw-beta), that I
forgot not everyone else does.

: I\'m just harping on the lasers as an example, though. A decision needs
: to be made regarding what technologies are best for what.  The people
: living in the high TL society have had thousands of years to figure out
: what trechnologies work for what.  (Can\'t you just see a weapons
: designer in the Regency smacking his forehead and saying, "Hey, all we
: need to do is make a *big* laser and all other weapons are obsolete!  I
: wonder why nobody thought of it in the last few thousand years?" :-)

I agree.  I think you figured that at TL15, each laser on a CT/MT
turret could produce about 50Mj of firepower.  This would equal a TNE
150Mj manned turret, and just fall short of an unmanned 210Mj turret.

The only thing that won\'t fit well, but yet I really like are
unfocused x-ray lasers.  They\'re absolute killers at shorter ranges.
However, there was nothing like them in CT/MT.

And while we\'re at it, we should probably bring back beam lasers.  8)

: Back to my first point... they\'re arbitrary in FFS, but it only bothers
: me because the rules allow better ones.  All we need to do is make it so
: the rules duplicate the range of CT weapons (though I\'m willing to give
: plasma/fusion weapons a miss for ships).
:
: -Merrick

There should be some rule limits to make the creations fit in with
established Traveller history.  As for range...  Hmm that\'s a tough
one.  I kind of like the range in BL.  I think that it makes sense,
but you\'re right, it does throw the ranges of other weapons off
kilter.  I think the best solutions would be to try and make the CT
ranges more in-line with BL.  Granted that may mean increasing the
range of some weapons.  Also, something I always wondered--why not use
gravitic focusing on weapons other than lasers?  For particle
acceleratos and meson guns it may not seem feasible, but why not for
plasma/fusion.  The amount of focusing doesn\'t have to be as powerful
as it is on lasers, just enough to give them a little range.  That
way, you could have the old Azhanti High Lightnings with plasma bays,
etc...

Maybe we need to get out more often?

Ah, but wait Alvin, there\'s more!  Don\'t forget that after Vampire
Ships it now appears that the RC will begin to use Virus aided ships.
Not much, but then again, a smartship may end up being quite a match.
I think that they will be able to take on The Guild and maybe even the
Solee Empire.  Plus, the pocket empire that appeared in both the Ref\'s
screen and an issue of Challenge seems like a very good ally for the
RC (once they meet each other).  Together, they seem like they could
stand up to The Guild and Solee.

As for the Regency.  They\'ve got enough problems worrying about the
Empress Wave and about their bursting britches.

And the Black Sphere.  It will start to grow.  Why, well here\'s my
take.  The Black Sphere is controlled by Emperor Strephon.  Well, not
the real one.  One of his robot doubles now infected by Virus sits on
the Iridium Throne.  He\'s planning on taking back his empire.  But two
things stand in his way.  First, he\'s been taking time out to rebuild
his forces.  Second, he\'s been playing with his favorite toy.  What\'s
that?  Lucan.  Or at least what\'s left of him.  Lucan is now a brain
in a metallic body that cannot die.  All he can do is be tortured and
survive.  Excruciating pain.  Strephon plans to kill him once for each
of his murdered subjects.  (Okay, I\'ll lay off the sugar cookies and
jolt).

To which I rebut:
        The TNE Rules WEREN"T PLAYTESTED!!!!!! I found more bugs in my
First Ed TNE book than ANY other game I own (My collection is rather large,
in the several hundred game systems). So bad in fact, that a second edition
was out in 6 months.
        The mechanics have only those few areas grafted in that define
traveller and have been unchanged since CT: Worlds, Trade, and Snimal
Encounters. The rest are a lift of t:2k and Dark Conspiracy, NOT
TRAVELLER!!!!!!!

What you are claiming is that a system which had been developed over 10
years smoothed out a totally different system. Sorry, just ain\'t so. Yes,
it\'s a passable system. Yes, it was a nice try. But see below:


And upon some other TNE Matters:

As for TNE Being more successful than MT: I have yet to see any proof of
that. My friendly neighborhood game store couldn\'t keep MT stocked
sufficiently; they can\'t get rid of TNE. Peter had to order 35 copies or
more of MT items; He orders 5 each for TNE, and still has half a dozen 1st
printing TNE Ruleboooks in the warehouse... That no one will buy. I ask you
Merrick, is THAT the success you talk about for TNE? (figures provided by
Peter Neuman of Bosco\'s Comics and Games, the only store in anchorage that
carries more than TSR and WWG)

Keep TNE ALIVE YOURSELVES -- but let the REAL TRAVELLER come back.

The MegaMerchants of the Imperium - merchant\'s over 100,000 Disp tons -
is the mainstay of Imperial Commerce.  Owned and controlled by either the
Imperial Government or the Megacorporations, these vessels are the
lifeblood of the Imperium, transporting billion\'s of tons of goods from
one Hi-pop world to another.

Practically all MegaMerchants are only to be found in the main body of
the Imperium: only a handful exist in the Spinward Marches, none over
200,000 disp tons.

The importance of MegaMerchants cannot be overestimated.  When the
Imperium speaks of \'protecting interstellar commerce\', they are not
talking of protecting 200 ton Beowolf free traders, but 5,000,000 ton Titan
transports.  A major task of the Imperial navy is protecting these
ships.  Even membership within the Imperium is related to the
MegaMerchants: these ships are not permitted to visit nonImperial worlds
(except,in special cricumstances, Imperial client states).  When
politicans talk of the Imperium being a \'trade confederation\', they mean
a confederation tied together partly by MegaMerchants.

There are less than 8,000 MegaMerchants within the Imperium.  Most, like
the \'George Bolme\' 200,000 ton class ships, are under the million-ton
limit.  Of the 600 ships over the million-ton limit, over 2/3\'s are
single jump, 5,000,000 disp ton Titan ships, devoted to a single large
main like the Vilani or Core Main. Only about 200 ships are Majesta\'s:
Jump4, 2G modular transports of over 2 million disp tons, these
ships are of great importance to GSbAG (the MegaCorp who builds them),
Tukera Lines LIC (The MegaCorp who runs them) and the Imperium.

These are the largest ships which follow the xboat routes, and thus the
ships needed for \'long-haul, huge cargo\' situations.  They have been used
to transport mile-long buildings from Vland to Capital, segments of grav
cities from Solomani Rim to Antares, and entire fleets of smaller ships
from Daibei to their Vargr buyers in the Marches.

An entire strain of Tukera Line corporate culture surrounds the
Majestas\'. It was Majesta crews that started the Great Merchant Strike of
904, (still the only Imperium-wide labour action in history) which froze
the entire Imperial economy for two years and sent entire sectors into
a decade-long depression. It was Majesta crews that were the first
MegaMerchants allowed to carry a (limited) number of dependents onboard,
for their 3-6 year runs across the Imperium.  It was Majesta ships that
were the first MegaMerchants to get enough lifeboats for the entire crew
(after the famous _Dragon\'s Trove_ disaster, which struck a mere 15 parsec\'s
from Capital).

For MegaCorp personnel, Majesta crews are a breed apart. Outspoken, vocal
and fully aware of their own importance, they take nothing from nobody,
be they Archduke, Administrator or Admiral.  Solomani-dominated, they have a
vigourous rivalry with the Vilani lines that dare challange their
dominance on the xboat routes.  (Nevermind free traders, who they view as
figures of fun).  Of course, Majesta crews recieve special care from
Tukera Lines, who are careful of crossing swords with them and aware of
their irreplaceable skills and experience.

*****----

Majesta\'s carry up to sixteen 50,000 disp Sekio Modules.  The cargo
version is nothing but a hull and a powerplant to power the control
systems.  It\'s entire hull is a clam-shell cargo door.  Of course, it has
no crew, but is controlled remotely by RCV workstations.

The passenger version is as above, but with basic life support and 49,900
low berths installed.  As there is still no crew, 2495 x TL 13a robot
brains are built-in (with a selection of robots) to service the medical
needs of the low passengers.

The 560 x 95-disp ton shuttles were originally to be used as lifeboats, but
are more often used as cargo haulers, on-loading and off-loading items
for the 200,000 kl internal cargo hold.  They are manned by built-in
robot brains for crew.

*****----

P.S. Yes, I know I should have installed some missiles on this ship, but
the problem is, it\'s _civilian_!  Installing the number of missile
turrents the ship deserves would make it very, *very* dangerous.
Better to invoke some \'Imperial Regulation\' forbidding missile
emplacements on MegaMerchants.

Here\'s my list of the 20 Traveller probucts I\'d like to see over the next
two years.

TNE: Reformation Coalition -

1) A book continuing the Virus Redux adventure. **

2) The Long Ships (RC Clipper sourcebook). *

3) The Player\'s Guide to the RC. **

4) Adventure book detailing RC\'s expansion into Massilla sector. **

5) Adventure book on RC dealings in Hiver space. **

6) G-Carriers, TNE vehicle combat game. *

7) Book of adventures dealing with the Empire of Solee. **

TNE: Regency -

8) Book of Regency adventures. **

9) Adventure book on Regency\'s first explorations in the Wilds. **

10) Book detailing other Spinward States. **

TNE: Generic -

11) Starship/ Spaceship book. How they work, deckplans, deck layout
on larger ships. Would include ships of the major Aliens. **

12) Simplified rule set for Brilliant Lances. *

13) Equipment/ Relic Equipment guide. **

14) Book on main TNE Pocket Empires. **

15) Second edition TNE rulebook, with the combat rules better explained
or changed. Might include history section detailing CT and MT eras. **

All Traveller -

16) Zhodani and Droyne. **

17) Vegans and minor humans/ aliens in the RC area. **

18) Darrian and minor humans/ aliens in the Spinward States. **

19) Solomani and Aslan. *

20) Vilani and Vargr. *

The ** means I\'d really want to see this, * means it wouldn\'t ruin my year if
it didn\'t appear - but I\'d still like to see it.

I wouldn\'t mind seeing the completion of the TNE novels that GDW were producing.

On the subject of Challenge:- How will we get the Traveller News Reports? At
the start of a book, as in Vampire Fleets? Maybe Traveller Chronicle Can carry
them.

I\'m doing an update on the document at the moment. It encompasses a few new
concepts on lasers. All within the rules :) I design lasers with Excel that
are linked to another sheet with all the tables in FFS (or almost) Thus I
only has to decide for TL and a few features of the laser like
manned/unmanned, x-ray, grav focused, nongrav focused, Point defense,
difficulty level, range and effect.

As I design lasers for range it is possible to make more powerful cheapeer
lasers. The reason for this is that a 3.6m FA at TL 15, grav focused has a
max effective range of 155 hexes. Clearly an overkill when the guidance only
can track the target properly at maximum of 80. Thus the lower diameter of
the FA and that also reduces the FA volume.

I\'ll give more info as the work progresses.

: To which I rebut:
:         The TNE Rules WEREN"T PLAYTESTED!!!!!! I found more bugs in my
: First Ed TNE book than ANY other game I own (My collection is rather large,
: in the several hundred game systems). So bad in fact, that a second edition
: was out in 6 months.
:         The mechanics have only those few areas grafted in that define
: traveller and have been unchanged since CT: Worlds, Trade, and Snimal
: Encounters. The rest are a lift of t:2k and Dark Conspiracy, NOT
: TRAVELLER!!!!!!!

Uhm no, what he\'s saying is that the GDW house system was a more
coherent and playable system than that presented in MT.  Typos have
nothing to do with playability.  Granted, they make the book look
sloppy, but that\'s not the case.  And before we go around slinging
reprintings and second editions, may I remind you that there is a
reason we call MegaTraveller TypoTraveller.

: What you are claiming is that a system which had been developed over 10
: years smoothed out a totally different system. Sorry, just ain\'t so. Yes,
: it\'s a passable system. Yes, it was a nice try. But see below:

Actually what he\'s claiming is that a system that developed for 10
years wasn\'t big enough to do what it wanted.  It became Mega-ized.
For better or worse.  Then someone decided to use a different system.
You know, I\'ve used MT and TNE for combat.  If TNE suffers from
anything in its combat is that it\'s too comprehensive.  More rules
than I cared to know.  Well, not really.  I find that a minimum of
them are used for what I consider sci-fi/Traveller combat.  And except
for the dice rolled, they both run about the same.

: And upon some other TNE Matters:
:
: As for TNE Being more successful than MT: I have yet to see any proof of
: that. My friendly neighborhood game store couldn\'t keep MT stocked
: sufficiently; they can\'t get rid of TNE. Peter had to order 35 copies or
: more of MT items; He orders 5 each for TNE, and still has half a dozen 1st
: printing TNE Ruleboooks in the warehouse... That no one will buy. I ask you
: Merrick, is THAT the success you talk about for TNE? (figures provided by
: Peter Neuman of Bosco\'s Comics and Games, the only store in anchorage that
: carries more than TSR and WWG)

Well, figures are going to be different all over the place.  At one
shop I go too, I\'m the only one that buys any TNE material.  At
another the stuff moves off the shelves, yet the MT stuff is on the
bargain rack.  I think what\'s going on here is that you\'ve got
different markets buying different products.  Success should never be
measured by just your corner of the world.

: Keep TNE ALIVE YOURSELVES -- but let the REAL TRAVELLER come back.

This is the poorest attitude I\'ve heard yet.  If you don\'t like it,
don\'t use it.  But Traveller is MegaTraveller is Hard Times is New
Era.  All have been created.  You pick the one you want to use, but if
you\'ve learned anything from the TNE debacle it\'s that you shouldn\'t
force any version of Traveller down anyone\'s throat.

The issue here isn\'t about keeping any particular era alive, it\'s
about keeping Traveller--period.  And remember, all three editions
have the word Traveller in their name.

Thanks for the info.  However, I don\'t suppose that you do still have

I don\'t remember reading anything in TNE indicating that the Regency and the
RC would necessarily be hostile:  The two are a great distance apart, the
Wilds (and Virus) are in between, and they share a common foe.  I can think of
few reasons to fight and many reasons not to.

Besides, who know what other things there may be to keep the Regency busy.

    'body' => '  I have been thinking about starting up a Traveller campaign with my
local gaming group.  I\'ll use the TNE rules, so I can use all the neat
FFS stuff that has been made.  I have been thinking about which setting to use.
  I was thinking about a Regency Campaign.  One thought was that the
players would be undercover Naval Intelligence agents posing as
merchants, with a high jump ship disguised as a common merchant.  A bit
like the Imperialine Frontier Transport, but smaller.
  Lately I have been thinking more and more about using the Reformation
Coalition.  None of the perspective players have ever played Traveller,
and most have only played AD&D, so the smaller scope of hte RC would be
nicer.  But the only problem I have with the RC, is the lack of
development for it. GDW has put out several very good sourcebooks for
the RC, but most have featured worlds external to the RC.  They
emphasize going out into the Wilds, either attacking it in Smash &
Grab, or exploring it in World Builder\'s Handbook. Those are both
useful, and I\'ll send my players out into the Wilds, but I also want to
play political intrigue and espionage adventures inside of the RC.  For
this I\'ll need more information on RC institions.  I thought that the
RC Players\'s Handbook would cover this, but with the demise of GDW, I
don\'t think that will come out anytime soon. :(
  So that leaves the development of the RC up to us.  I have been thinking we 
need:

1) More details on individual members worlds.  Someone asked about this
months ago, and several people said they would try to post something ,
but they never did. :(

2)Corporations, There are few such as Trybeccorp, Kruytercorp, and Dawn
Construction, but these are mostly one line references.

3)Criminals Orginzations: Need people for the players to beat up.

4)Misc groups: The League of the Imperial Way is a good example. I
forgot who posted that but I liked it.

5) Various other things to flesh out the RC.  There are only 20 worlds
in the RC, it should be alot easier to flesh out than the entire Domain
of Deneb,.. errr Regency. (Not that the Regency is bad, I still like
that too.  The holes let each GM customize it.)

6) THe RC is also a dynamic place with things constantly happening.
There should be stories about other groups of free-lancers, RCES ships
etc (ie other player groups)  Also the RC wants to expand, so there
should be new members as time goes bye.

7) More Aliens: I don\'t think there should be more aliens in the RC,
but in the territory surrounding it.  If you look at the Spinward
Marches, there are several aliens across the sector, and in some case
several in a susbsector, (look at Aramis, in the TRAVELLER Adventure)

8) Space around it: GDW gave us details about parts of Old Expanses and
Diaspora Sectors, but nothing to the rimward sectors. Solmani Rim and
Alpha Crucis.

Well those are a bunch of ideas, that I thought the RC needs,  I am
sure you people can come up with more.  l am also working some answers
for some of these also.  I have an idea for Transstar, the remnants of
the Solmani Megacorporation.  I have some ideas for a RICE style paper
on Oriflamme, an idea for an elite group of Oriflamme Marines, a
criminal orginization based on the Vermene and a couple other ideas.
I should have Transstar and the Ori marines done by Friday.

Well some food for thought.

Oops, It was late at night, and I guessed about this, rather badly at that.
Well just assume the White Star wants to study a the creation of a
nuetron star, not just a prexisting one.

That is true for Type Ia supernovae, but it is thought that for Type Ib
supernovae that they actually leave behind a nuetron star.  Of course
this is a point of contention, and no one really knows, so I assumed
that the White Star could control the accretion and what other factors
so that it came out with a Neutron star.

I also noticed last night while thumbing though the Rebellion
sourcebook is that the Old Expanses Depot is in the coreward subsector
adjacent to the Shenk Subsector where the Solee Empire is.  It might be
that the Solee staged an expedition to the Depot to salvage what ever
remains after 82 years of war and virus.  If they didn\'t, it would make
for a neat place for the players to go for an adventure.



Jerry Alexandratos  mentioned:

 Did anyone catch that in the Regency Sourcebook in the section where
they talk about Avery going off to vist the Empress Wave, they
mentioned that his ships used captive virus strains.
  This suggests that the Regency leadership is much less afraid of the
Virus than the common people.  So they might have Regency Military
ships outfitted with new super duper computers, and just not tell
anyone that they are based on the Virus, or maybe they will just
convince everyone that they are safe.

him for promoting Traveller than GDW.  What made GDW fail was not that
people like us weren\'t buying their products, but that they weren\'t
getting any _new_ customers.
It is true that TNE alienated many long-time Traveller fans, and
I\'m sure their loss was greatly missed, but what is going to
make or break any future Traveller products is whether they are capable
of attracting new customers in sufficient numbers.  Despite all the
gripes we may have had with GDWs typos and whatnot over the years, I
don\'t think anyone would dispute that Traveller has always been the best
sci-fi game on the market.  That\'s not the problem.  The problem is that
it hasn\'t been _selling_.
IMHO, the suggestions we could give Marc Miller that are most
likely to contribute to the game\'s future success are ways in which he
can attract new generations of gamers to the Traveller universe.  Who
plays Trav?  Who could be persuaded to play Trav?  For that matter, who
plays and spends money on the successful RPGs out there?  It is largely
the high school/college crowd, I suspect.  If Traveller is to be anything
but a game for collectors and die-hards, it must appeal to these people
and be marketed to them effectively.

In the offical universe, Dulinor\'s forces start out with enough men and
ships to give Lucan a very hard fight.

But isn\'t it rather unlikely that the Illeish Domain - which isn\'t a
high-threat region, and faces no enemies - would have at least the same
number of ship\'s as Corridor and COre fleets - both traditionally
overstaffed and overequipped?

Let\'s instead assume that Lucan crushes Dulinor\'s navy by about 1120, and
either intimidates or conquer\'s the rest of the fraction\'s by about 1125.
Let\'s also assume that he can - and did - conquer Dulinor without
stripping the ship\'s from Vland and Daibei, thus not provoking those
areas into rebellion.

1125: After failing for the second time in as many years to reconquer
Terra, Lucan orders an armistice with the Solomani, and finally turns his
attention to the last region to be reunified: the Domain of Deneb.

1126: Aware that Imperial fleets will soon complete the reconquest of
Vargr-held Corridor, Archduke Norris directs the Domain navy to
concentrate on the Aslan-held rimward regions of the Domain, ans swears
feality to Lucan.

1127: Excluding the Solomani Rim, the Imperium is fully reunified and at
peace for the first time since 1116.  Lucan is deemed Emperor by the Moot
in 113-1127, and coronated as such 295-1128.

1127-1145: For the remainder of his reign Emperor Lucan spends his
efforts not in rebuilding the Imperial infrastructure but in persecuting
his enemies, both real and imagined.

First the Imperial services, then the entire Nobility, and finally the
Megacorporations are ruthlessly purged by Lucan\'s agents, led by the new
Ministry of Loyalty and given muscle by Imperial Household troops.

Even Archduke Norris is eventually brought down.  Invited to Capital by
the Emperor to hear out his recommendations to upgrade various systems to
TL F, the Emperor instead charges him with treason during the rebellion
period, by ignoring his orders, entertaining ideas regarding Deneb
independence, permitting illegal psions to exist, and deliberately
hindering Imperial communications through Corridor.  News of his execution
on 93-1130 causes sector-wide riots in the Marches: the new Archduke (an
old noble rival of Norris\') puts down the unrest brutally.

All interstellar information networks - including the Traveller News Service
- is brought under the control of the Ministry of Information, and used to
dissemminate offical propaganda.

1145-1157: Lucan - by this time only vaguely connected with reality -
relies more and more heavily on Luna Croce, Admiral of the Imperial
Fleet.  The very epitome of an officer in Lucan\'s Imperium*, Admiral
Croce eventually manages to obtain total control over who and what Lucan
hears.

* "The Imperial Service needs people like you: good looking, well
   educated and totally without scruples."
                    - common Imperial saying, from 1127 onwards

As Lucan continues to deteriorate, Admiral Croce uses her position as
Lucan\'s most trusted advisor (and eventually his mistress) to position
herself as his successor.  While Lucan - in his own delusive, twisted way
- really does thing that he is acting in the Imperial interest, Croce has
no such concern.  One of the new breed of Imperial officers, she wished
only to maximise her power over everything and everyone, and views
challanges to her desires as only rank insolense.

1157: Lucan suffer\'s yet another massive overdose of JoyRide, but this time
his personal physicans can\'t pull him through, and he dies on Holiday 1157.
Savage fighting rips through the Imperial Palace as Admiral Croce\'s
forces clash with Imperial Household troops.  Croce\'s forces are
victorious, but she is betrayed by one of her co-conspiractors, and dies
in an ambush on her own flagship.

Eventually, Duke Cleoai of Core Sector clamps down on the chaos, and
manages to get the majority of local Admirals behind him as a temporary
regent.  As part of the deal, the Duke reconvines the Imperial Moot for
the first time since 1145 (Admiral Croce managed to stifle the Moot\'s
operation, as part of her plans to centralize all power in Lucans - and
her - hands.)

The Moot begin\'s deliberations in 241-1157 (down to about 2% of it\'s size
in Strephon\'s reign.)  Even as nobles gater into the Moot Spire,
hundred\'s of petty rebellions break out in the wake of Lucan\'s death.
Under pressure to act quickly, they choose stability, and selects the
head of the Vilani megacorporation Zirunkariish Count Shigidgagilir
Shiishuginsa, as the new Emperor.

[Note: Zirunkariish focuses on banking and investment]

1157-1165: Emperor Shigidgagilir begins a \'velvet purge\' of Imperial
Forces, giving Lucan\'s political appointees comfortable retirement
packages and replacing them with career men with proven records.

[WARNING! Unintentionally, this basically finishes off any hope for mercy
from Imperial commanders by rebels and dissidents.  At least the wastrels
could be bribed: all the \'successful\' commanders left fall under the
following slots:
  A] they obey all orders, all the time
  B] they always win, all the time, and are willing to do *anything* to win
  C] they are *extremely* competent, so competent that the Imperium is
willing to overlook their \'unconventional\' political views as long as
they continue to deliver such excellent results
  D] they have so much connections, it would make a computer tech green
with envy

Remember, the Imperium that Lucan created cares nothing for honour or
justice, only results.  And the Imperium promotes on that basis, alone.]

While prasing Lucan for keeping the Imperium together and destroying the
enemies of the Irridium Throne, Shigidgagilir also repealed many of
Lucan\'s more onerous (or simply stupid) policies.  A limited amount of
freedom is again permitted, a certain amount of dissidence is ignored
rather than prosecuted.  Especially popular, Shigidagilir dismantled the
Ministry of Loyalty, and brought several of the more despised and abusive
nobles and military men to a sticky and abrupt end.

However, much of Lucan\'s legacy remains.  The families of the Archdukes
remain as \'guests\' of the Imperial Palace, and Shigidgagilir continued to
ban Archdukes from either collecting their own taxes or have any
involvement in military affairs.

Moreover, the policy of crushing any and all violent rebellions
continues: Sessionist movements are persecuted ruthlessly, and the
instinctive reaction to unrest is not to find out what\'s the root of the
problem, but to call in the Marines (and the occassional orbital
bombardment) to fix the problem.

Even planets _rumoured_ to planning to rebel tend to wake up one day to find
several hundred thousand tons of naked Fleet steel in orbit above their
heads, to say nothing of the nuclear reactors, high-explosive shells, and
massive particle accellerators.*  Cold, competent, hard-eyed Imperial
Investigators barge into the local parliement asking all sorts of
uncomfortable questions.  HUNDREDS of G6 fighters streak through the
sky, their roaring thunder shattering windows, with the shards falling
like so much rain.  Imperial marines float through the sky like the
children of Death, glistening against the clouds.

And that\'s the worlds _rumoured_ to soon rebel.

The Imperial Household has quietly taken up the Lucan-era Noble loyalty
checks (just in a more quieter, less fanatic, more deadly manner) and
directs criticism of the government, while offically tolerated, is
likely to cause serious trouble and thus rarely heard in public.

While the Imperial Household spies on the nobility (which, of course,
includes all senior military oficers), the IISS spies and reports on
populations and worlds.  Their old research mission is long gone, and
their new role as finks makes the Scouts less than popular outside of the
Imperial Core (ESPECIALLY in places like the Marches, where the
population harbors some serious eminity towards the Imperial Government).

Of course, their new authority and police powers does provide some
compensation...

he had more friends and bigger guns than I had.  The rest of the planet

They did.

1165 - present (1170): Emperor Shigidgagilir heads the 1165 Arrisheak
Conference on Capital.  At the Conference, the Imperial Government, the
Megacorps, and the larger sector-wide businesses finally organize their
plans to rebuild the Imperial economy to its pre-Rebellion size.  Special
attention was focused on the \'hard-hit\' areass: 38 years after the
Rebellion, and those sectors still remain in Hard Times.  Most of the
worlds in these areas are impoverished or dead, many are occupied by
Imperial troops, and pirates still hit the weaker and less-defended
systems with impunity.

                Imperial Sectors, 1170

    Unharmed: Imperial core sectors (rather prosperous, due to the
    buildup of the Navy and the retread of many megacorporations to this
    area.)

               Core, Zarushagar, Vland, Lushun

    Unharmed: Not as prosperouns, but not damaged by the Rebellion, either.

      Spinward Marches, Fornast, Diaspora, Daibei, Ley Sector

    O.K./Recovering: Damaged, but is now healing up.  Tend to support the
    Imperial government most vigourously, after the Imperial core regions.
    (With maybe a few local exceptions...)

      Reaver\'s Deep, Deneb, Empty Quarter, Dagudashaag, Massila, Delphi,
      Old Expanses

    Hard-Hit sectors: Damaged, bleeding, violent.  Home of a thousand
    dirty little wars.  Just beginning to recieve serious Imperial aid.
    (Attached to certain political conditions, of course)

      Corridor, Reft, Trojan Reach, Gushemege, Verge, Illelish, Antares


Imperial culture, 1170 - Racism

In 1118, soon after Lucan learned that the Vargr Archduke Bzrk broke away
from his rule, Lucan banned all Vargr from the higher reaches of Imperial
power.  Even after the Rebellion, Imperial attitudes against aliens -
esp. Vargr and Aslan - continued to harden.  In 1130 Lucan specifically
declared the Third Imperium to be a *human* empire, and reduced all
nonhuman citizens to either "legal aliens" if their homeworld was within
the Imperium or "illegal aliens" if it isn\'t.

Limited expulsions of illegal aliens began from 1130: as the Imperial
government regained strength and stability, expulsions became both more
widespread and more harsher, with fewer and fewer exceptions.  By 1170,
there were no illegal aliens in Unharmed sectors, and only a few million
impoverished holdouts in Recovering sectors.  Now, as the Imperium begins
to regain full control over the weakest sectors, expulsions (and the
occasional genocidal incident) are beginning there.

Some debate in Imperial circles revolve on wether psionic Droyne should
be expelled from Imperial space, but hte current Emperor has ruled them
"legal aliens".  However, contact whth the Droyne and their worlds is
carefully controlled: humans on worlds with Droyne have been resettled
elsewhere; the converse is true of Droyne.

Imperial culture, 1170 - the Nobility

The power and prestige of the nobility - after many years of weakness
before Lucan and his \'advisor\' Admiral Croce - is quickly growing now.
Emperor Shigidgagilir is promoting them in aneffort to balance out the
power of the Navy, while weakening the powers the military has.

[Just in the period 1165-1170, he has forced the Military to end Martial
Law in over 25 subsectors, while allowing only two subsectors to be placed
under military administration.]

He is also vigourously restoring not just the nobility per se, but also
feudalism as a concept.  Noble houses and feudal priveleges are
increasing in both number and power, and the Ministry of Heraldy and the
Ministry of Noble Affairs have been given new political sigificance.
Finally, the entire concept of birthcaste is being promoted by the
Emperor in an effort to solidify and stabilise an interstellar society
still in flux.

The basic upshot of all this is that commoners are finding it more and
more difficult to change their social status or attain any position of
power.  At the same time, a form of feudal/caste socialism is rapidly
becoming the basis of Imperial societies everywhere.

[True, it\'s still possible to work your way up in some megacorps, and the
Imperial military is still more interested in your ability then your
bloodline.  However, in both areas people with the right bloodline
tend to go places more faster nowadays...]

One example of \'refeudalization\': it\'s now illegal for nobles to sell
capital (ie starships, stocks, factories, land) worth over 100 MCr to
nonnobles.  If they can\'t find a noble to buy their property, they must
sell to the Imperial government "at fair market value".

In 1168, a new initative with significant implications was launched by
Emperor Shigidgagilir: he commanded that all noble children MUST be
educated at Capital/Core, or forfeit their right to rule.  He also ordered
all unborn nobles MUST undergo \'genetic conditioning\', to increase their
physical & mental potential to the maximum possible.

Fraud!  Ensuring that the cargo matches the cargo manifest is a critical

indicates 20,000 tons of miscellaneous radioactives (including wastes,
medical stuff, and weapons-grade) and 3,000 low berth passengers, mostly
refugees (Tukera PR:  "There\'s absolutely no danger from radiation.
Everything is perfectly shielded.  And the robot medtechs are more human

numbers add up to 9?  9+13= that\'s right, 22.  You\'re catching on.

favor of "real Traveller".  While I think that Wil\'s wording was a bit
extreme, I have to agree with him that CT and MT are the "real" Traveller
systems.  Call me a stodgy traditionalist, but TNE always struck me as a
desperate attempt by GDW to get on the bandwagon of flashy RPG\'s with a
dark-chic background.  I don\'t think the TNE system is all that bad,
thought the combat system is a little cumbersome, but I think the complete
change in rules systems was a mistake that scared off a lot of old
Traveller players.  Almost everyone who played CT moved on to MT (in my
experience anyways), and those that didn\'t were (speculating here) scared
off by the 10 typos per page.  On the other hand, many people playing MT
did not move on to TNE (I\'m one, and there are lots more on the sister
mailing list). The main reason being that TNE was not an extension of
the previous games, but a completely different game system with a loosely
related background.  I think going back to the MT system would be a good
move so long as it is fixed up a bit and the rule book is *thouroughly*
proof-read.

Having said this, I have to agree with Jerry that the important thing is
to keep Traveller alive, in whatever form.  People should be prepared to
accept the fact that no one is going to get exactly what they want. Also,
Marc Miller seems to have his mind set on going back to a CT/MT variant of
some sort, so we are to some degree arguing a moot point here, no?  I
realize that YARS tries one\'s patience, but I for one am prepared to give
the game one more chance (if this doesn\'t work out, I\'m definately going
over to GURPS!  :-).

Yours Diplomatically,
Charles.

Having said that, I\'ve always wanted a 3D Traveller universe.  It\'s not at
all hard to do.  You keep hex maps, but have subsectors by 10 x 10 x 5
parsecs.  Each world symbol has a number in it indicating its Z
coordinate, and you figure out distances with pythagoras (or include a
little 6x6 table for the math challenged).  Because the Z
dimension is relatively thin, you cut down on overlapping star-systems.
Where there are two systems "on top" of one-another, you just split up
the hex.

3D space combat is a much more complicated matter, but I\'ve come up with
a system which is not TOO cumbersome (I don\'t think there\'s any way to
make it really simple).

Yup. I can\'t judge the real figures for this sort of thing, but I think a
company that stops supporting demo teams, conventions, etc. is likely to
lose some (if not a lot) of new trade.

To explain further, BITS (British Isles Traveller Support) is, to my
knowledge, the only organisation of any size in the UK (and Ireland :-) )
which is dedicated to keeping Traveller alive. BITS organised its first
small event (just a couple of gaming tables at Recon 95) in December last
year, and despite fog keeping many people away, we managed to encourage a
few passers-by to join in and by the end of the session they were
sufficiently enthused that they were going to go back to their own RPG clubs
to try to get other people to play Traveller.

Now that\'s one sure-fire way of getting customers. However, getting support
for such activities from GDW or anyone else is difficult.

Just to show that I "walk the talk", BITS is intending to run a TOURNAMENT
event at Euro Gen Con in September 1996 (hope all the UK members are
listening in!) and I\'m in contact with Marc Miller to see if he can help us
to advertise whatever new products he\'s got out by then. Hopefully we\'ll
also be attending other events in the meantime. That all takes a lot of
work, and at the moment it\'s being done purely by myself and a few core
die-hards within BITS for the love of it. If we were sponsored in some way
and had Traveller stock to sell at events, I can guarantee the sales of
Traveller in the UK would go UP!

An important reason for having a demo\' team to attend RPG events,
particularly ones at Universities and colleges - even schools.

Enough blithering.

That\'s an absolutely CRITICAL point and I hope MARC MILLER is listening. A
major reason (so far as I\'m aware) that MT didn\'t sell well was because from
the start, a lot of people got the (accurate) impression that the rule books
would have had less errata and typos in them if a blindfolded illiterate
wombat had typed them in. If that happens, people don\'t buy - they hang
around waiting for the next printing to see if the bugs have gone away. And
they look at any new publication with a wary eye... that might not be so
crippling for a supplement but for the main rules books of a \'new\' (compared
to CT) game, YOU CAN\'T AFFORD SUCH BAD QUALITY CONTROL.

Apologies if anyone connected with the original books is listening in... but
then as is pointed out in TML551 by anwfh@acad2.alaska.edu (William F.
Hostman), the TNE rules weren\'t bug-free either.

This time, GET IT RIGHT FIRST TIME.

Needless to say I have already humbly offered my writing and proof-reading
services to Marc... :-)

Personally I think FFS is great - I love tinkering around with design
rules, and the flexibility of FFS is amazing. I agree that it could have
done with some pre-designed plug-in units (MFD\'s, sensor suites etc), but
being able to design wepons, vehicles, and starships in such detail is
something that previous versions of traveller lacked.

As for settings, while I love the extensive and rich history of the Trav
universe, it is very daunting to new players (hence the adoption of the
RC in TNE I imagine). Also, I personally prefer smaller but more detailed
and varied universes. Its very easy when your players are roaming across
a sector or two for them to get into the "let\'s go to Widget in 0723, its
high pop AND TLC!" - in other words, you soon fall into the trap of not
looking beyond the UPPs.

My favourite alternate setting would be a Traveller:2300 one. I like the
idea of a TL11-12 setting, where frontiers are real and haven\'t EVER been
explored before, with the various nations  of earth all having their own
agenda. It makes the universe a far more exciting and dynamic place than
the star-spanning empire of CT and MT.

Anyway, that\'s what I think :)

rules systems, everyone\'s pet hates being brought to the fore, etc.,
I thought I might as well add some more to that.  Personally, I
prefer the TNE system.  I like it, in fact.  Admittedly, I missed out
on the pleasures (?) of the "three little black books" (CT) and came
into Traveller with MT so I can\'t speak with the authority of some
people but...

Imagine the scene, if you will.  After buying the boxed set of
MegaTraveller the new player (possibly GM) sits down after reading
the rules to create a *new* character.  It\'s one of his favourite
past-times.  Off we go... roll, roll, clatter, clatter.  Hmmm - the
scouting career looks fun let\'s go for that.  More rolling and
clattering in abundance.  Yes!  He\'s been commission... oohh I can
feel his personality and history coming together now.  What a lucky
dice roll - he\'s been promoted.  Wow, what a history.  He\'s dead.
HE\'S DEAD?  Is it just me or is slightly off to kill characters in
generation?

TNE is, in my rather humble opinion, far superior to MT in many
aspects.  Task Resolution springs to mind... easy, reliable and
flexible.  Combing skill and attributes together creates more
believable characters - it is possible to have characters with a
great deal of ability (i.e., high attribute) and with very little
practical experience (i.e., low skill rating).  Not possible with the
old task system.  I know... I had to suffer through combat task rolls
in "2300AD: Man\'s Battle for the Stars."  Urgh, was that a horror.

If anyone can send me further information on CT and how MT is
superior then feel free... there are aspects of TNE that I would
rather not keep (the mistakes, for one) but others that I would (the
character generation! ;-)

>From what I can gather the main problem is with the TNE era itself.
So what\'s the problem?  Just stick it back into the "classic era".
Bring out some (bug free) supplements about mercantile acitivity,
adventure ideas, etc.  Also, if memory serves, I can remember some
people having a gripe about the Rebellion when it occurred.

Remember... every game is playable.  Even WW stuff if you can forget
about that awful system.  One thing that I would change is the
technology... Traveller was created in 1970\'s and it just seems to be
using technologies that were envisaged then.  In a reprint/aditional
information, why not put in some of the more current theories?

Hope I don\'t get flamed too much.

I agree with you.  In general the TNE rules are better written and have
benefited from years of "playtesting" through CT and MT.  I know some people
feel that TNE is little more than a military game, but it does not have to be
that way.  The "crawling your way out of the dark ages" setting will tend to
lend itself to more military campaigns and TNE has a lot of work invested
into those type of rules and suggestions, but there is no reason that a TNE
game has to concentrate there.  The rules are just as capable of handling
non-military role-playing and are in many ways simpler than the earlier
systems.  A lot of it depends on what the GM and his players want in their
game.

I Think you are right its all up to the GM. I like making weapons and starships 
and if i find a
task to complex i make a spreadsheet to help me , I dont whine about the lack 
of calculator or
how the old rules were simpler, thay were also less flexable.  Who remembers in 
CT how a small
fighter can damage a ship 1000 times its size. In MT you could build fleet that 
could not be hurt
except by meson Spinal Mounts making Figther and escorts useless. And how about 
Nuclear Damper in
 CT where it puts a shield about your ship that stops nuclear explosions within 
it radius,
a radius that was an entire hex.
  My point is this the combat system in TNE works, and no system is ever 
perfect but, with TNE
atleast you know rules are easy and not everybody is going to be a retired

Another possibility is to just say (as canon) that the subsector maps
represent a map of jumpspace, not normal space.  In normal space, the
star systems are in 3d, but they can just as well be represented as flat
in Jspace.  The only problem with the canon are that the multi-subsector
maps show it superimposed on a galactic map.

I\'d have to argue the comments about HG.  Fighters have to be able to
damage ships much larger than they are, or the arms race that resulted
in them never would have happened.  Fighters and escorts were only
useful to the extent that they could fire large factor missile attacks
at the big boys, it is true.  But how does this really change in BL/BR?
In BL fighters can\'t hurt big ships, in BR they can (with the same exact
missiles!)----in fact an unopposed fighter can destroy a Tigress in BR
(but not in BL).  With respect to spinal mounts, they are the major
weapons in BL/BR even though they shouldn\'t be given the laser design
rules in FFS----a lack of playtesting (which I guess is good since
otherwise they would have ditched all the non-laser directed energy
weapons :-)

As for dampers, they weren\'t provided, but they were promised, so the
lack of them in FFS (the mention that they would be coming was in BL)
was an oversight, not an intentional change in the history.  Also, in CT
there wasn\'t really a hex to put your ship in.  Book 2 doesn\'t mention
dampers that I recall, and HG doesn\'t mention the range of a damper
screen.  I always assumed it was just a little farther out than range of
proximity detonation range for a nuke (on the order of 10s of
kilometers, I would think----maybe a couple hundred).

So the RCS Thunderchild
    Jumps into the system and promptly attacks the tender (to move the

    The player acting as the commander of their modified Corbra class

    'body' => 'Hi Mr. Miller.  The subject line is just my little suggestion as to a
name for the new Traveller rules set you are planning.  It captures the idea
that the rules will be generic and cover many historical eras (BTW, that
is an AWESOME idea).

I, like most Traveller fans, have a million ideas regarding the
4th generation of Traveller.  I\'ve already sent you one letter, and
here\'s another.  This one\'s quite lengthy I\'m afraid, but you _did_ say you
wanted lots of feedback :-).

First, some general policy opinions.  I completely agree with you
about returning to the CT/MT systems (with some tweaking and adjusting, of
course), and I also agree that the most important thing of all is to make
the rules simple and accessible.  I\'m the first to criticize rules
systems which pander to the lowest common denominator, but the reality is
that simpler systems do better in terms of sales.  Systems such as White
Wolf\'s Storyteller line and SJ Games GURPS attract a lot of fans because they
are easy to get into and allow one to concentrate on roleplaying.  The
original Traveller was similarly easy to understand, and the increased
complexity of later systems was a mistake, in my opinion.

I think the look and feel of the new rules set is important.
Another typo-ridden set of books would be unforgiveable.  I suggest that
there be less fancy layout work and more emphasis on clear and concise
rules which have been thouroughly tested and proof-read.  This is not to
say that the rules set should be devoid of artwork, I think art is
extremely important in today\'s gaming market.  But a large percentage of
the artistic resources for the project should be aimed at a really, really
good cover and some full-page works inside (i.e., instead of lots of in-line
images and so on).  And care should be taken to make things readable by
using good serif fonts and well laid-out tables.

In terms of the variety of products you suggested, I think that
they are mostly great ideas.  However, I personally detest collector card
games, so I would vote against that particular concept.  Though it might
potentially bring a lot of money, I don\'t think such a game would work for
Traveller (mind you, I\'m admittedly biased).  The T-shirts and posters are
great PR (I would wear mine with pride!), and the novels/comics/graphic
novels would attract new players as well as fleshing out the feel of the
game for old players.  But I think the single most important thing you\'ve
mentioned in terms of new products are the computerized play aids.
Traveller is a high tech game, and it should have high tech support.  If
it is economically non-viable to include diskettes or CDs with the game
("Be sure to specify Mac or PC when ordering your copy of OmniTraveller"),
then at least include a list of web resources somewhere and allow
downloads of things like planet, system, character, and equipment design
programs. I\'m sure you could find people on the TML and XTML mailing lists
who would program these as shareware (in fact, some good programs are
already available as you probably know, and would only need minor
adjustments to fit in with the new rules). The CD-ROM would be even better
than this, of course, but I wonder if that\'s not pie in the sky at this
point.

Now on to more specific suggestions...


CHARACTER GENERATION

In terms of a character generation system, I like the advanced
systems presented in MT.  I would like to see such advanced systems
provided for more of the non-military careers, though.  I would also like
to see characters get "hobby" skills as they do in TNE.  This allows one
to flesh out the character without sacrificing its viability.  I would
also like to see a set of rolls for generating background aspects of the
character such as number of family members and salient life events.
Cyberpunk and Robotech both have interesting examples of this.  Of course,
such a system would only be a springboard and players would be free to
generate their backgrounds without resorting to rolls.  It would also be a
good idea to include (perhaps as a sidebar) a quickie generation system in
which characters are designed using points (a la Traveller:2300).  This
allows faster character creation for "beer and pretzels" nights and
satisfies the subsection of the gaming public who think that characters
should be designed instead of rolled.  It also makes it quicker and easier
to introduce new players to the game (on this note, there should be a set
of pre-generated characters included for quick start purposes).  Any
character creation system should be devoid of survival rolls, which I
think were a bad idea in the first place (sorry), and should have a method
for "upping" hopeless characters (like in TNE).
In addition to the character abilities Traveller has traditionally
had, I would like to see something along the lines of "Alertness" and
"Appearance" characteristics.  The latter is less important than the
former, but I think some kind of basic roll for noticing things is
required in any RPG.


TASK SYSTEM

I like the basic idea of the MT task system, though I think it
would be best to go back to number targets instead of the "simple,
average, difficult..." concept (not sure why, that just always stuck in my
craw).  The task system should have provisions for extreme successes and
failures, and also for "unknown results" (I don\'t particularly like MT\'s way
of dealing with either of these).
The way I deal out extreme results is this:  If the player rolls
doubles, he rolls the task again.  If the new roll yields the same result
as the old roll (i.e., they are both successes or both failures), then the
result becomes extreme.  This works quite well because it makes it
unlikely for someone who needs a 12+ to get an extreme success (he needs
to roll rolls of 12+ in a row to get it), but still allows a slim
possibility.  The chance of extreme success goes up proportionally with
one\'s chance of basic success, but never gets exceedingly high (and the
same is true of extreme failure).  Even a player needing only a 3+ to
succeed only has about a 15% chance of extreme success.  Another advantage
is that even a character needing only 3+ to accomplish something has a
minute chance of screwing up completely.
Because of the even way doubles are distributed through the distribution of
possible dice rolls, one\'s chances of rolling them are always roughly
proportional to one\'s chances of success and failure.  That is, roughly
1/6th of one\'s successful rolls will be doubles, no matter what the
target is (and this is also true of failures).
In terms of "unknown result" tasks, I generally do this:  After
the player has made his roll, the Referee rolls two dice secretly, adding
the first to the player\'s roll and subtracting the second.  Thus, the
player has a ballpark idea of what his "real" roll was, but can\'t be sure.
For example, if he rolled a success, then he _thinks_ he\'s fixed the
air-raft successfully, but he might have missed something.  If his roll
was a borderline success then he\'s going to be even more uncertain of his
fix.  A situation can even arise where the character rolls an apparent
failure but in fact succeeds:
Tech: "I can\'t figure out what\'s wrong with this thing, I\'ve
taken it apart and put it back together, and I can\'t seem to find
the problem."
Pilot (pressing ignition switch): "Um, I don\'t know what you did,
but it seems to be working fine."
Tech (watching as air-raft lifts off): "Damn, I hate it when that
happens!  You never do figure out what you did right!"
(I\'ve personally experienced this many times while programming.)

 This system also allows for differing degrees of uncertainty in task
resolution:  for slightly uncertain tasks, the referee rolls half dice
(i.e. +1d3 and -1d3).  For highly uncertain tasks, he rolls +2d6 and -2d6,
making the player\'s roll only  a very rough estimate of the "true" roll.
Note that if the player\'s roll is an extreme success or
failure, there is no uncertainty roll as such results are considered
"obvious".  I\'ve found that this rule is the best way to combine the
above ideas, anything else gets clumsy.
I like the way MT allows abilities to affect tasks, but I think
the DM for an ability should be 1/3 rounded down instead of 1/5.  This is
a minor point, but I like the way this turns out:

Stat ValueDescriptionDM

1-2very poor+0
3-5poor+1
6-8average+2
9-11good+3
12-14excellent+4
15superior+5

The major advantage here is that ability DM\'s come out as being a very
similar scale to skill levels.  Of course, task targets have to be set a
little higher (1 higher than MT works for me) because an average stat
yields a +2 DM, but this is a minor detail.


PERSONAL COMBAT

Again, I like the MT system in general, but would like to see
some adjustments.  My only request is that whatever combat system is
used, have armor subtract from damage, not from chance to hit.  The later
idea is an import from the era of basic D&D and I think it is horribly
unrealistic.
A modular combat system would be a good idea.  Start with
something extremely simple and then allow optional rules for more realism.
In a non-military campaign, people should be able to resolve combats in 5
minutes, while mercenary players should be allowed to cram in as many
tactical options and gory details as desired.  If a CT type system is
being used, tables should be provided as in Snapshot so that players don\'t
have to keep track of too many DMs.  In general, efforts should be made
to reduce the number of DMs which have to be dealt with.


SPACE COMBAT

Again, a modular system would be best.  Perhaps start with an
abstract system similar to High Guard for really quick resolution of space
combat (no need to pull out the hex maps and miniatures), and then add in
a map-based system as an "advanced" version.  I have a suggestion for
movement on a hex grid which roughly simulates vector based motion (I
think the Brilliant Lances system is okay, but this is better, in my
humble opinion).  It uses 12 directions in the same way as Brilliant
Lances (i.e., hex sides and vertices).  A given ship starts each turn with
one of the 12 directions and a speed in hexes.  The movement goes like
this.

1. Initial Vector:  Ship moves, in the direction it is facing, a number of
hexes equal to its speed (zig-zagging if it is moving through a hex
vertex).  A marker is left behind in the hex it started out in.

2. Adjusting Vector:  The ship may move from its new location to any hex
within n hexes, where n is G\'s of thrust available.

3. Calculate New Vector:  Count the number of hexes between the ship\'s
final location and the counter marking its initial location.  That is the
ship\'s new speed.  The ship\'s new direction is determined by tracing a
line from the center of its initial hex through its present hex.  If
there is some ambiguity as to which direction the ship should be
going in, the player moving the ship simply decides between the two options.

I\'ve found this system is quick and gives a nice approximation of vector
movement.  It is also a little more intuitive than Brilliant Lances.  If
turns are made to be 10000^.5 seconds long (about 317s or 5
minutes), then hexes can be 1000 kms across, allowing for large planetary
templates with rings of hexes around the outside representing the gravity
well.  The ring goes out to whatever distance the .5g limit is.
Essentially, one is "rounding up" gravitational effects.  I realize this
is a bit unrealistic, but it sure is fun!  To add gravity to the above
system, you simply put in a fourth step whereby ships whose vectors pass
through gravity-well hexes are moved 1 hex towards the planet center.
This necessitates the calculation of a second "new vector".  It\'s like
Book 2 with hexes.
In terms of combat damage, I would like to see a system which is
a little more "deadly" than High Guard or Book 2.  A good way to do this
would be to make ships more vulnerable the more hits they take (e.g., the
hull is weakened).  This would help to make combats shorter so that they
could be incorporated into a gaming session without dominating it. Long
space combat sequences lead to boredom for players whose characters are
not pilots or gunners.
That brings me to another suggestion.  I\'d like to see a piloting
roll or better yet some sort of piloting decisions worked into the combat
system (perhaps as an optional advanced rule).  This would give pilots
some actual input into the outcome of space combats (something lacking in
Book 2 and High Guard).
As a sidebar in the ship combat section of the rules, there should
be a brief explanation of the physics of space combat.  Another sidebar
should describe the feel of Traveller space combat:  Less like dog-fights,
more like submarine combat.  Suggest Hunt for Red October and Crimson
Tide as inspirations for the sensor-based techno-warfare feel of it.


MASS COMBAT SYSTEMS.

No really specific suggestions here, I\'d just like to see them
included.  Once again, nothing complex, just a simple abstract system for
determining small fleet-level and platoon-level encounters.


DESIGN SYSTEM

I hate to say it, but I\'m not sure this should be included in the
basic rules.  Don\'t get me wrong, I like designing stuff, but I don\'t
think it\'s the kind of thing most roleplayers are into, especially when
they are just starting out with a game.  I think the design system should
be left for a second book.  Many people on the mailing lists have
suggested something along the lines of FF&S "Lite".  I think that\'s the
way to go.  Have a separate book with a design system somewhere between
FF&S and High Guard in terms of complexity, and include a lot of
pre-designed equipment and "standard option packages".


WORLD GENERATION

There have been a lot of calls for the world generation systems
to be adjusted so that vacc worlds will tend to have lower populations
and so that worlds will generally come out to be more "reasonable". I
completely disagree with this.  I think one of the great things about
being a Traveller referee is having to come up with explanations for
apparently illogical UWP\'s.  There is a nice little article on this at

http://www2.hb.se/sexet/goeran/twp/rules/unusualU.htm

on Goran\'s Traveller web page (one you should definately mention
somewhere in the rule book, it\'s really good. Joe Heck\'s page is another
must).

I like the fleshing out provided by DGP\'s rules (e.g. Grand Survey
and World Tamer\'s...), but if there is to be a complete Scouts-like star
system generation system, it should be simplified or computer-supported.
I\'ve made a few star systems with Scouts, and I\'ve got it down to the
point where it only takes me on the order of 2.5 hours to make a small
system. That\'s way too long.
There has been a lot of debate lately on the e-mail lists
regarding tech level designations.  I think this is just the thread of
the week and you shouldn\'t be overly concerned with changing this.  Of
course, that\'s just my opinion as I\'ve never had any problem with the TL
designations.


CONVERTING BETWEEN SYSTEMS

One thing which is a must for any new Traveller rules system is
the ability to convert between the previous incarnations.  A system
for doing this should be included in an appendix.  This will allow
players to access the wealth of material floating around out there from
CT, MT and TNE.  The appendix should also allow conversion to and from
GURPS.  This will bring in new players who, while they will continue to
use the GURPS rule set, will buy OmniTraveller (or whatever it ends being
called) supplements and other supplies.  It works for White Wolf and
their Storyteller line.  People buy the GURPS: Vampire basic rule book,
but then go out and buy all the Clan sourcebooks, adventures, and other
things.

Well, that\'s it from me.  I hope my "War and Peace" didn\'t put
you to sleep :-).

Charles.

favor of "real Traveller".  While I think that Wil\'s wording was a bit
extreme, I have to agree with him that CT and MT are the "real" Traveller
systems.  Call me a stodgy traditionalist, but TNE always struck me as a
desperate attempt by GDW to get on the bandwagon of flashy RPG\'s with a
dark-chic background.  I don\'t think the TNE system is all that bad,
thought the combat system is a little cumbersome, but I think the complete
change in rules systems was a mistake that scared off a lot of old
Traveller players.  Almost everyone who played CT moved on to MT (in my
experience anyways), and those that didn\'t were (speculating here) scared
off by the 10 typos per page.  On the other hand, many people playing MT
did not move on to TNE (I\'m one, and there are lots more on the sister
mailing list). The main reason being that TNE was not an extension of
the previous games, but a completely different game system with a loosely
related background.  I think going back to the MT system would be a good
move so long as it is fixed up a bit and the rule book is *thouroughly*
proof-read.

Having said this, I have to agree with Jerry that the important thing is
to keep Traveller alive, in whatever form.  People should be prepared to
accept the fact that no one is going to get exactly what they want. Also,
Marc Miller seems to have his mind set on going back to a CT/MT variant of
some sort, so we are to some degree arguing a moot point here, no?  I
realize that YARS tries one\'s patience, but I for one am prepared to give
the game one more chance (if this doesn\'t work out, I\'m definately going
over to GURPS!  :-).

Yours Diplomatically,
Charles.

there are cons as well as pros.  For one thing, it would make all
previous maps and subsector data useless, thus junking a large part of
the background that makes Trav such a great game.  It might even have
some nasty effects on the history of Known space.

Having said that, I\'ve always wanted a 3D Traveller universe.  It\'s not at
all hard to do.  You keep hex maps, but have subsectors by 10 x 10 x 5
parsecs.  Each world symbol has a number in it indicating its Z
coordinate, and you figure out distances with pythagoras (or include a
little 6x6 table for the math challenged).  Because the Z
dimension is relatively thin, you cut down on overlapping star-systems.
Where there are two systems "on top" of one-another, you just split up
the hex.

3D space combat is a much more complicated matter, but I\'ve come up with
a system which is not TOO cumbersome (I don\'t think there\'s any way to
make it really simple).

Yup. I can\'t judge the real figures for this sort of thing, but I think a
company that stops supporting demo teams, conventions, etc. is likely to
lose some (if not a lot) of new trade.

To explain further, BITS (British Isles Traveller Support) is, to my
knowledge, the only organisation of any size in the UK (and Ireland :-) )
which is dedicated to keeping Traveller alive. BITS organised its first
small event (just a couple of gaming tables at Recon 95) in December last
year, and despite fog keeping many people away, we managed to encourage a
few passers-by to join in and by the end of the session they were
sufficiently enthused that they were going to go back to their own RPG clubs
to try to get other people to play Traveller.

Now that\'s one sure-fire way of getting customers. However, getting support
for such activities from GDW or anyone else is difficult.

Just to show that I "walk the talk", BITS is intending to run a TOURNAMENT
event at Euro Gen Con in September 1996 (hope all the UK members are
listening in!) and I\'m in contact with Marc Miller to see if he can help us

also be attending other events in the meantime. That all takes a lot of
work, and at the moment it\'s being done purely by myself and a few core
die-hards within BITS for the love of it. If we were sponsored in some way
and had Traveller stock to sell at events, I can guarantee the sales of
Traveller in the UK would go UP!

That\'s an absolutely CRITICAL point and I hope MARC MILLER is listening. A
major reason (so far as I\'m aware) that MT didn\'t sell well was because from
the start, a lot of people got the (accurate) impression that the rule books
would have had less errata and typos in them if a blindfolded illiterate
wombat had typed them in. If that happens, people don\'t buy - they hang
around waiting for the next printing to see if the bugs have gone away. And
they look at any new publication with a wary eye... that might not be so
crippling for a supplement but for the main rules books of a \'new\' (compared
to CT) game, YOU CAN\'T AFFORD SUCH BAD QUALITY CONTROL.

Apologies if anyone connected with the original books is listening in... but
then as is pointed out in TML551 by anwfh@acad2.alaska.edu (William F.
Hostman), the TNE rules weren\'t bug-free either.

This time, GET IT RIGHT FIRST TIME.

Needless to say I have already humbly offered my writing and proof-reading
services to Marc... :-)

Personally I think FFS is great - I love tinkering around with design
rules, and the flexibility of FFS is amazing. I agree that it could have
done with some pre-designed plug-in units (MFD\'s, sensor suites etc), but
being able to design wepons, vehicles, and starships in such detail is
something that previous versions of traveller lacked.

As for settings, while I love the extensive and rich history of the Trav
universe, it is very daunting to new players (hence the adoption of the
RC in TNE I imagine). Also, I personally prefer smaller but more detailed
and varied universes. Its very easy when your players are roaming across
a sector or two for them to get into the "let\'s go to Widget in 0723, its
high pop AND TLC!" - in other words, you soon fall into the trap of not
looking beyond the UPPs.

My favourite alternate setting would be a Traveller:2300 one. I like the
idea of a TL11-12 setting, where frontiers are real and haven\'t EVER been
explored before, with the various nations  of earth all having their own
agenda. It makes the universe a far more exciting and dynamic place than
the star-spanning empire of CT and MT.

Anyway, that\'s what I think :)

prefer the TNE system.  I like it, in fact.  Admittedly, I missed out
on the pleasures (?) of the "three little black books" (CT) and came
into Traveller with MT so I can\'t speak with the authority of some
people but...

Imagine the scene, if you will.  After buying the boxed set of
MegaTraveller the new player (possibly GM) sits down after reading
the rules to create a *new* character.  It\'s one of his favourite
past-times.  Off we go... roll, roll, clatter, clatter.  Hmmm - the
scouting career looks fun let\'s go for that.  More rolling and
clattering in abundance.  Yes!  He\'s been commission... oohh I can
feel his personality and history coming together now.  What a lucky
dice roll - he\'s been promoted.  Wow, what a history.  He\'s dead.
HE\'S DEAD?  Is it just me or is slightly off to kill characters in
generation?

TNE is, in my rather humble opinion, far superior to MT in many
aspects.  Task Resolution springs to mind... easy, reliable and
flexible.  Combing skill and attributes together creates more
believable characters - it is possible to have characters with a
great deal of ability (i.e., high attribute) and with very little
practical experience (i.e., low skill rating).  Not possible with the
old task system.  I know... I had to suffer through combat task rolls
in "2300AD: Man\'s Battle for the Stars."  Urgh, was that a horror.

If anyone can send me further information on CT and how MT is
superior then feel free... there are aspects of TNE that I would
rather not keep (the mistakes, for one) but others that I would (the
character generation! ;-)

>From what I can gather the main problem is with the TNE era itself.
So what\'s the problem?  Just stick it back into the "classic era".
Bring out some (bug free) supplements about mercantile acitivity,
adventure ideas, etc.  Also, if memory serves, I can remember some
people having a gripe about the Rebellion when it occurred.

Remember... every game is playable.  Even WW stuff if you can forget
about that awful system.  One thing that I would change is the
technology... Traveller was created in 1970\'s and it just seems to be
using technologies that were envisaged then.  In a reprint/aditional
information, why not put in some of the more current theories?

Hope I don\'t get flamed too much.

I agree with you.  In general the TNE rules are better written and have
benefited from years of "playtesting" through CT and MT.  I know some people
feel that TNE is little more than a military game, but it does not have to be
that way.  The "crawling your way out of the dark ages" setting will tend to
lend itself to more military campaigns and TNE has a lot of work invested
into those type of rules and suggestions, but there is no reason that a TNE
game has to concentrate there.  The rules are just as capable of handling
non-military role-playing and are in many ways simpler than the earlier
systems.  A lot of it depends on what the GM and his players want in their
game.

Nuclear Damper in

a radius that was an entire hex.
  My point is this the combat system in TNE works, and no system is ever

atleast you know rules are easy and not everybody is going to be a retired

Another possibility is to just say (as canon) that the subsector maps
represent a map of jumpspace, not normal space.  In normal space, the
star systems are in 3d, but they can just as well be represented as flat
in Jspace.  The only problem with the canon are that the multi-subsector
maps show it superimposed on a galactic map.

I\'d have to argue the comments about HG.  Fighters have to be able to
damage ships much larger than they are, or the arms race that resulted
in them never would have happened.  Fighters and escorts were only
useful to the extent that they could fire large factor missile attacks
at the big boys, it is true.  But how does this really change in BL/BR?
In BL fighters can\'t hurt big ships, in BR they can (with the same exact
missiles!)----in fact an unopposed fighter can destroy a Tigress in BR
(but not in BL).  With respect to spinal mounts, they are the major
weapons in BL/BR even though they shouldn\'t be given the laser design
rules in FFS----a lack of playtesting (which I guess is good since
otherwise they would have ditched all the non-laser directed energy
weapons :-)

As for dampers, they weren\'t provided, but they were promised, so the
lack of them in FFS (the mention that they would be coming was in BL)
was an oversight, not an intentional change in the history.  Also, in CT
there wasn\'t really a hex to put your ship in.  Book 2 doesn\'t mention
dampers that I recall, and HG doesn\'t mention the range of a damper
screen.  I always assumed it was just a little farther out than range of
proximity detonation range for a nuke (on the order of 10s of
kilometers, I would think----maybe a couple hundred).

So the RCS Thunderchild
    Jumps into the system and promptly attacks the tender (to move the
player on to a new area).
    The player acting as the commander of their modified Corbra class

    rest into instead attacking the clipper.  After they role played the

his ship to move into range and hit them with a full missile

    'body' => 'Hi Mr. Miller.  The subject line is just my little suggestion as to a
name for the new Traveller rules set you are planning.  It captures the idea
that the rules will be generic and cover many historical eras (BTW, that
is an AWESOME idea).

I, like most Traveller fans, have a million ideas regarding the
4th generation of Traveller.  I\'ve already sent you one letter, and
here\'s another.  This one\'s quite lengthy I\'m afraid, but you _did_ say you
wanted lots of feedback :-).

First, some general policy opinions.  I completely agree with you
about returning to the CT/MT systems (with some tweaking and adjusting, of
course), and I also agree that the most important thing of all is to make
the rules simple and accessible.  I\'m the first to criticize rules
systems which pander to the lowest common denominator, but the reality is
that simpler systems do better in terms of sales.  Systems such as White
Wolf\'s Storyteller line and SJ Games GURPS attract a lot of fans because they
are easy to get into and allow one to concentrate on roleplaying.  The
original Traveller was similarly easy to understand, and the increased
complexity of later systems was a mistake, in my opinion.

I think the look and feel of the new rules set is important.
Another typo-ridden set of books would be unforgiveable.  I suggest that
there be less fancy layout work and more emphasis on clear and concise
rules which have been thouroughly tested and proof-read.  This is not to
say that the rules set should be devoid of artwork, I think art is
extremely important in today\'s gaming market.  But a large percentage of
the artistic resources for the project should be aimed at a really, really
good cover and some full-page works inside (i.e., instead of lots of in-line
images and so on).  And care should be taken to make things readable by
using good serif fonts and well laid-out tables.

In terms of the variety of products you suggested, I think that
they are mostly great ideas.  However, I personally detest collector card
games, so I would vote against that particular concept.  Though it might
potentially bring a lot of money, I don\'t think such a game would work for
Traveller (mind you, I\'m admittedly biased).  The T-shirts and posters are
great PR (I would wear mine with pride!), and the novels/comics/graphic
novels would attract new players as well as fleshing out the feel of the
game for old players.  But I think the single most important thing you\'ve
mentioned in terms of new products are the computerized play aids.
Traveller is a high tech game, and it should have high tech support.  If
it is economically non-viable to include diskettes or CDs with the game
("Be sure to specify Mac or PC when ordering your copy of OmniTraveller"),
then at least include a list of web resources somewhere and allow
downloads of things like planet, system, character, and equipment design
programs. I\'m sure you could find people on the TML and XTML mailing lists
who would program these as shareware (in fact, some good programs are
already available as you probably know, and would only need minor
adjustments to fit in with the new rules). The CD-ROM would be even better
than this, of course, but I wonder if that\'s not pie in the sky at this
point.

Now on to more specific suggestions...


CHARACTER GENERATION

In terms of a character generation system, I like the advanced
systems presented in MT.  I would like to see such advanced systems
provided for more of the non-military careers, though.  I would also like
to see characters get "hobby" skills as they do in TNE.  This allows one
to flesh out the character without sacrificing its viability.  I would
also like to see a set of rolls for generating background aspects of the
character such as number of family members and salient life events.
Cyberpunk and Robotech both have interesting examples of this.  Of course,
such a system would only be a springboard and players would be free to
generate their backgrounds without resorting to rolls.  It would also be a
good idea to include (perhaps as a sidebar) a quickie generation system in
which characters are designed using points (a la Traveller:2300).  This
allows faster character creation for "beer and pretzels" nights and
satisfies the subsection of the gaming public who think that characters
should be designed instead of rolled.  It also makes it quicker and easier
to introduce new players to the game (on this note, there should be a set
of pre-generated characters included for quick start purposes).  Any
character creation system should be devoid of survival rolls, which I
think were a bad idea in the first place (sorry), and should have a method
for "upping" hopeless characters (like in TNE).
In addition to the character abilities Traveller has traditionally
had, I would like to see something along the lines of "Alertness" and
"Appearance" characteristics.  The latter is less important than the
former, but I think some kind of basic roll for noticing things is
required in any RPG.


TASK SYSTEM

I like the basic idea of the MT task system, though I think it
would be best to go back to number targets instead of the "simple,
average, difficult..." concept (not sure why, that just always stuck in my
craw).  The task system should have provisions for extreme successes and
failures, and also for "unknown results" (I don\'t particularly like MT\'s way
of dealing with either of these).
The way I deal out extreme results is this:  If the player rolls
doubles, he rolls the task again.  If the new roll yields the same result
as the old roll (i.e., they are both successes or both failures), then the
result becomes extreme.  This works quite well because it makes it
unlikely for someone who needs a 12+ to get an extreme success (he needs
to roll rolls of 12+ in a row to get it), but still allows a slim
possibility.  The chance of extreme success goes up proportionally with
one\'s chance of basic success, but never gets exceedingly high (and the
same is true of extreme failure).  Even a player needing only a 3+ to
succeed only has about a 15% chance of extreme success.  Another advantage
is that even a character needing only 3+ to accomplish something has a
minute chance of screwing up completely.
Because of the even way doubles are distributed through the distribution of
possible dice rolls, one\'s chances of rolling them are always roughly
proportional to one\'s chances of success and failure.  That is, roughly
1/6th of one\'s successful rolls will be doubles, no matter what the
target is (and this is also true of failures).
In terms of "unknown result" tasks, I generally do this:  After
the player has made his roll, the Referee rolls two dice secretly, adding
the first to the player\'s roll and subtracting the second.  Thus, the
player has a ballpark idea of what his "real" roll was, but can\'t be sure.
For example, if he rolled a success, then he _thinks_ he\'s fixed the
air-raft successfully, but he might have missed something.  If his roll
was a borderline success then he\'s going to be even more uncertain of his
fix.  A situation can even arise where the character rolls an apparent
failure but in fact succeeds:
Tech: "I can\'t figure out what\'s wrong with this thing, I\'ve
taken it apart and put it back together, and I can\'t seem to find
the problem."
Pilot (pressing ignition switch): "Um, I don\'t know what you did,
but it seems to be working fine."
Tech (watching as air-raft lifts off): "Damn, I hate it when that
happens!  You never do figure out what you did right!"
(I\'ve personally experienced this many times while programming.)

 This system also allows for differing degrees of uncertainty in task
resolution:  for slightly uncertain tasks, the referee rolls half dice
(i.e. +1d3 and -1d3).  For highly uncertain tasks, he rolls +2d6 and -2d6,
making the player\'s roll only  a very rough estimate of the "true" roll.
Note that if the player\'s roll is an extreme success or
failure, there is no uncertainty roll as such results are considered
"obvious".  I\'ve found that this rule is the best way to combine the
above ideas, anything else gets clumsy.
I like the way MT allows abilities to affect tasks, but I think
the DM for an ability should be 1/3 rounded down instead of 1/5.  This is
a minor point, but I like the way this turns out:

Stat ValueDescriptionDM

1-2very poor+0
3-5poor+1
6-8average+2
9-11good+3
12-14excellent+4
15superior+5

The major advantage here is that ability DM\'s come out as being a very
similar scale to skill levels.  Of course, task targets have to be set a
little higher (1 higher than MT works for me) because an average stat
yields a +2 DM, but this is a minor detail.


PERSONAL COMBAT

Again, I like the MT system in general, but would like to see
some adjustments.  My only request is that whatever combat system is
used, have armor subtract from damage, not from chance to hit.  The later
idea is an import from the era of basic D&D and I think it is horribly
unrealistic.
A modular combat system would be a good idea.  Start with
something extremely simple and then allow optional rules for more realism.
In a non-military campaign, people should be able to resolve combats in 5
minutes, while mercenary players should be allowed to cram in as many
tactical options and gory details as desired.  If a CT type system is
being used, tables should be provided as in Snapshot so that players don\'t
have to keep track of too many DMs.  In general, efforts should be made
to reduce the number of DMs which have to be dealt with.


SPACE COMBAT

Again, a modular system would be best.  Perhaps start with an
abstract system similar to High Guard for really quick resolution of space
combat (no need to pull out the hex maps and miniatures), and then add in
a map-based system as an "advanced" version.  I have a suggestion for
movement on a hex grid which roughly simulates vector based motion (I
think the Brilliant Lances system is okay, but this is better, in my
humble opinion).  It uses 12 directions in the same way as Brilliant
Lances (i.e., hex sides and vertices).  A given ship starts each turn with
one of the 12 directions and a speed in hexes.  The movement goes like
this.

1. Initial Vector:  Ship moves, in the direction it is facing, a number of
hexes equal to its speed (zig-zagging if it is moving through a hex
vertex).  A marker is left behind in the hex it started out in.

2. Adjusting Vector:  The ship may move from its new location to any hex
within n hexes, where n is G\'s of thrust available.

3. Calculate New Vector:  Count the number of hexes between the ship\'s
final location and the counter marking its initial location.  That is the
ship\'s new speed.  The ship\'s new direction is determined by tracing a
line from the center of its initial hex through its present hex.  If
there is some ambiguity as to which direction the ship should be
going in, the player moving the ship simply decides between the two options.

I\'ve found this system is quick and gives a nice approximation of vector
movement.  It is also a little more intuitive than Brilliant Lances.  If
turns are made to be 10000^.5 seconds long (about 317s or 5
minutes), then hexes can be 1000 kms across, allowing for large planetary
templates with rings of hexes around the outside representing the gravity
well.  The ring goes out to whatever distance the .5g limit is.
Essentially, one is "rounding up" gravitational effects.  I realize this
is a bit unrealistic, but it sure is fun!  To add gravity to the above
system, you simply put in a fourth step whereby ships whose vectors pass
through gravity-well hexes are moved 1 hex towards the planet center.
This necessitates the calculation of a second "new vector".  It\'s like
Book 2 with hexes.
In terms of combat damage, I would like to see a system which is
a little more "deadly" than High Guard or Book 2.  A good way to do this
would be to make ships more vulnerable the more hits they take (e.g., the
hull is weakened).  This would help to make combats shorter so that they
could be incorporated into a gaming session without dominating it. Long
space combat sequences lead to boredom for players whose characters are
not pilots or gunners.
That brings me to another suggestion.  I\'d like to see a piloting
roll or better yet some sort of piloting decisions worked into the combat
system (perhaps as an optional advanced rule).  This would give pilots
some actual input into the outcome of space combats (something lacking in
Book 2 and High Guard).
As a sidebar in the ship combat section of the rules, there should
be a brief explanation of the physics of space combat.  Another sidebar
should describe the feel of Traveller space combat:  Less like dog-fights,
more like submarine combat.  Suggest Hunt for Red October and Crimson
Tide as inspirations for the sensor-based techno-warfare feel of it.


MASS COMBAT SYSTEMS.

No really specific suggestions here, I\'d just like to see them
included.  Once again, nothing complex, just a simple abstract system for
determining small fleet-level and platoon-level encounters.


DESIGN SYSTEM

I hate to say it, but I\'m not sure this should be included in the
basic rules.  Don\'t get me wrong, I like designing stuff, but I don\'t
think it\'s the kind of thing most roleplayers are into, especially when
they are just starting out with a game.  I think the design system should
be left for a second book.  Many people on the mailing lists have
suggested something along the lines of FF&S "Lite".  I think that\'s the
way to go.  Have a separate book with a design system somewhere between
FF&S and High Guard in terms of complexity, and include a lot of
pre-designed equipment and "standard option packages".


WORLD GENERATION

There have been a lot of calls for the world generation systems
to be adjusted so that vacc worlds will tend to have lower populations
and so that worlds will generally come out to be more "reasonable". I
completely disagree with this.  I think one of the great things about
being a Traveller referee is having to come up with explanations for
apparently illogical UWP\'s.  There is a nice little article on this at

http://www2.hb.se/sexet/goeran/twp/rules/unusualU.htm

on Goran\'s Traveller web page (one you should definately mention
somewhere in the rule book, it\'s really good. Joe Heck\'s page is another
must).

I like the fleshing out provided by DGP\'s rules (e.g. Grand Survey
and World Tamer\'s...), but if there is to be a complete Scouts-like star
system generation system, it should be simplified or computer-supported.
I\'ve made a few star systems with Scouts, and I\'ve got it down to the
point where it only takes me on the order of 2.5 hours to make a small
system. That\'s way too long.
There has been a lot of debate lately on the e-mail lists
regarding tech level designations.  I think this is just the thread of
the week and you shouldn\'t be overly concerned with changing this.  Of
course, that\'s just my opinion as I\'ve never had any problem with the TL
designations.


CONVERTING BETWEEN SYSTEMS

One thing which is a must for any new Traveller rules system is
the ability to convert between the previous incarnations.  A system
for doing this should be included in an appendix.  This will allow
players to access the wealth of material floating around out there from
CT, MT and TNE.  The appendix should also allow conversion to and from
GURPS.  This will bring in new players who, while they will continue to
use the GURPS rule set, will buy OmniTraveller (or whatever it ends being
called) supplements and other supplies.  It works for White Wolf and
their Storyteller line.  People buy the GURPS: Vampire basic rule book,
but then go out and buy all the Clan sourcebooks, adventures, and other
things.

Well, that\'s it from me.  I hope my "War and Peace" didn\'t put
you to sleep :-).

        I\'m weary of this whole debate. GDW, who was the copyright holder,
named the game TRAVELLER The
New Era. That makes it Traveller. It has the SAME background as all previous
versions of the game, merely advanced in the timeline. Yes, it has a
different system; so what? TRAVELLER has always been more background than
system. You may not like the direction that the background took (I wasn\'t
terribly fond of the Rebellion myself) but it\'s still Traveller, because
those responsible for producing it SAID it was! When Marc Miller
puts out a new edition, whatever that may be, THAT will be Traveller!
        When Traveller does come back, you better hope it does so with a
state-of-the-art 1990\'s era system, or you\'ll be mourning it\'s death again
before long. Classic Traveller belongs to the 1970\'s; there it should
remain. TNE may have had flaws, but at least it looked and played like
TODAY\'S RPG\'s.

going to be based on the original system, but with, as Mr. Miller put it "20
years of roleplaying experience"  added in. With almost that much
experience myself, here\'s what I think those "upgrades" should entail:
        1.) Improved Character Generation rules that keep the flavor of
CT/MT character creation while skipping the Survival roll (it can be assumed
the PC\'s ARE survivors or they\'d never be PC\'s in the first
place) and allowing for MORE SKILLS!! (7-8 levels per average character
simply is not enough in comparison to other games that have skill systems.)
And perhaps Advantages and Disadvantages (in some fashion) to help flesh out
personality!
        2.) A skill system which is less broad; I personally feel that the
level of detail in the TNE skill system is about right, as is the basic
ratio of 2 new levels for each 1 old level.
        3.) A task system! The somewhat maligned MT task system was actually
not that bad. I have seen worse, and no less a source than Steve Jackson
once said he thought it was good. (Steve is one of my gaming gurus.)
        4.) A combat system with a degree of realism but still relatively
easy to use. Again, MT didn\'t do too bad in this department. At least we got
away from Battle Dress making you harder to hit! That kind of abstraction is
"creeping D&D-ism" from the seventies that we can do without!
        5.) An abstracted space combat system that requires nothing but pen,
paper, and imagination. The system as presented in the Mk1, Mod1 rulebook
for TNE could, with very little trouble, be reworked for the new game. I
of course also would like to see a tactical ship combat game with the level
of detail of Brilliant Lances, but with Mayday-style movement.
        6.) Vehicle design systems that WORK and are fairly easy to use. I
do NOT want to see a repeat of the
MegaTraveller Generic Vehicle Design Charts. FF&S should simply be
translated to the new rules, the reality errors fixed, and away you go! Put
the design rules for STARSHIPS and ROBOTS in the core rules, and leave the
rest for the supplement.
        As much as I enjoy TNE, I agree that GDW erred seriously in not
making it easy to convert systems.
I agree wholeheartedly with the ideas expressed for a conversion appendix;
it is absolutely vital, especially
to bring TNE players in.
        What I want to see is a system which uses the best parts of TNE and
MT (which, in terms of it\'s basic
design, was an improvement over CT), with new goodies added as well.

I am not sure one could say that the Kafers "trashed" the French Arm.  There
was a war.  For a while the nations of Earth were losing, then they started
winning.  If anything, since 2300 was the T2k setting +300 years, there is a
message of hope in there.

Then again, there was the "death watch" program junk put out at the end...

    'body' => 'OK, I bitched about the tech problems that exist in the currently existing
Traveller world-view (and what I still think is the dead end of FFS, even
excepting its un-necessary level of obtuseness in design), now, just to
show what a little bit of creative thinking can achieve -- the reasons *why*
the Imperium is such aa backward place!

There are actually two (related) reasons --

1) The reason for Terra\'s defeat of the Ziru Sirka at the end of the Nth
Interstellar war, and

2) The Terran Federation\'s *loss* of the Nth Interstellar war

(and, no, the above two statements are *not* mutually exclusive - bear with
me for a while!)

How to Win a Modern War

Here we are making certain important assumptions - that "modern" wars mean
full scale conventional wars rather than guerilla actions and the sort of
civil disorder that is masquerading as "war" in Africa and (to a great
degree) Bosnia and Chechnya; and that they are, ultimately *Total War* (i.e.
they are wars to the "death" ... or the destruction/conversion of one side
by the other).

Given this, and assuming that the US Civil War is the first of the modern
"Total Wars" (the Napoleonic wars don\'t quite cut the mustard here), then it
can easily be seen that the winning side is always the side that has the
largest and strongest economy. This was the case in the Civil War, WW1 and
WW2.

Now, although the initial Interstellar Wars were fought by Terra against
the local Provincial Governor on the Imperial Rim, by the end they were
occupying the whole attention of the Ziru Sirka. Given that, then the Terran
Federation would have lost. It doesn\'t matter that they may have had
access to more advanced technologies, they would have succumbed to Imperial
mass in the same way the Germans had better tanks but could not stand up to
US tanks simply because the US had many more than the Germans did (being
simplistic here). It doesn\'t matter that the Terrans had *some* vessels that
had the advantage of better JDrives (it is unlikely that they would have
been able to re-equip the entire fleet with brand new ships!), they *still*
would have lost.

Accepted that as a reasonable assumption? Well, then, *how* in the hell did
the Terran Federation win? The answer is simple -- *they* actually
outproduced the Ziru Sirka!!! How? Simple, there seems to be an assumption
all through Traveller (in prices of equipment and services, in all the
design rules, and in all the supplementary material) that the Imperium has
an industry that is basically the same as that of *here and now*. That is,
basically manpower intensive (after all, we are assuming a civilisation
some 3000 years in the future here -- the exact opposite should be true, tho,
of course, the term is quite relative)! In other words, most people go off
to work in factories that, apart from producing high-tech goods, are not
too different from those today.

This is quite ridiculous. Why would it be the case ... well, we know from
assorted source material that in both the Imperium and the Solomani sphere
there are anti-robot forces that have forced this on both governments. Or
so it is suggested!! This is not *entirely* true - the real truth is that
the inherently conservative Vilani social structure has rejected anything
more advanced (how does this affect the Solomani? bear with me).

The Terrans of the Nth Interstellar War period, however, had no such qualms
and produced increasingly highly roboticised factories that, at the end,
effectively became half Von Neumann machines (i.e. capable of producing
anything less complex than themselves) and, *right* at the end, *full*
Von Neumann machines (capable of reproducing even themselves). These autofacs
mined their own resources, refined the ores and chemicals, and produced the
finished products on demand, all without any (or much) human intervention.
Productivity was vastly more than it is now in 1996 (or is in the 6th
millennia of the Imperium), 100 fold, 1000 fold, 10000 fold? More? Regardless,
the Terran Federation were able to swamp the Imperials with tech at the
"cutting edge" and beyond that only they could afford to produce in bulk.

*That\'s* how they defeated the Vilani.

2) How the Terran *Federation* lost the Nth Interstellar War.

But I just explained how they beat the Vilani ... !!! Note the wording
carefully *beat the Vilani* ... NOT *won the Nth Interstellar War*. This
is important.

We know from Megatraveller (Imperial Encyclopaedia) and other Traveller
material (especially re the Psionics Institutes) that the Imperium has no
qualms about, and a long record of, manipulating the truth to turn the
whole of "accepted" history into nothing less than an organised lie.

Thus, the Terran Federation *did* lose the Nth Interstellar War even tho
they *did* defeat the Vilani! How? Simple, the Terran Federation - the
democratically elected government of the Terran Sphere - were betrayed by
bloody-handed fascist militarists under Admiral Estigaribbia!

The fleet elements that supported the fascists could not have been enough
to force the Federation to accept their rule on a long term basis -- a
significant proportion, probably a majority, would have remained loyal
to the civilian government -- so they needed assistance. And who offered
it to them? Who did these elitists have more in common with , the
democrats or the Vilani aristocrats? Answer\'s simple - they got the support
of the Vilani aristocrats and Megacorps, as well as the troops and ships to
enable them to occupy the key worlds of the Terran sphere with Vilani
forces to keep the majority of ordinary Terrans who loathed the military
plotters under "control".

What was the price for this assistance? Well, neither the Vilani Megacorps
(who would have been run out of business) nor the Vilani bureaucrats liked
the idea of technology run rampant, social disruption, and uncontrolled
change that the Autofacs represented, so they demanded that all the *really*
advanced models be destroyed. The Admiral and his lackeys agreed - as,
after all, *they* didn\'t want their precarious hold on power disrupted by
some new tech development either!

So, there we have it! The Imperial Data Packet is intended to *restrict*
the spread of technology, *not* foster it! The laughably stupid way in
which it rates technology is a deliberate ploy by the Imperial manipulators
to get the populace to accept some basically identical technologies as
*different*, to think of really outrageous technologies as "doable", and
generally have a distorted view of the *reality* of tech development. After
all, if you can manipulate the way a man thinks, that\'s a whole hell of
a lot better than fighting him.

3) How about the Solomani? Well, the Vilani occupation forces were *all over*
the Terran sphere, and they didn\'t just "go away" ... there was resistance
to the Imperials for generations. Thus, when the "Long Night" fell, there
were substantial Vilani populations on all the Solomani planets -- and they
felt the need to identify themselves with the locals during that period of
chaos, and so adopted Terran names and faked their backgrounds.

They were so entrenched in control of the bureaucracies of the Solomani
planets that they were exceptionally successful in doing so - and they
have remained successful to the present day! In fact, many of the senior
leaders of the Solomani Party are close to pure Vilani in genetic terms,
and they *know* it ... the whole "Solomani Supremacy" rubbish is more
about the power it gives them to take on the Imperium and be big fish in
a little pond (as opposed to little ones in a big pond) than anything
else!

See what a little paranoid conspiracy theory can do with the stuffed Tech
rating system? And *all* of the above either fits the "facts" as already
known or, where they may be minor discrepancies, this can be passed off as
the Imperial manipulation of the truth. And it all makes a weird sort of
logical sense.

   Aside the tragic loss of GDW, I fear that there is another victim as
well: the TNE game mechanics.  To many Traveller fans, the TNE source
information and background are tied totally to the game mechanics.  This
was never intended to be the case.  TNE was conceived of as the basis
for a whole series of sourcebooks dealing with non-post-Collapse
settings and even alternative universes (FF&S didn\'t include all that
alternative technology just for variety\'s sake).  Perhaps in some ways
it was _too_ flexible, as more than one person I have talked to uses the
TNE game mechanics with their pre-1117 Spinward Marches campaign
(some have even went on past 1117 ignoring the Rebellion and Collapse
completely).  If GDW was guilty of anything in that regard, it was in
not ``keeping a finger up in the wind`` and adapting to the marketplace.
Instead of _yet_ another sourcebook on the Reformation Coalition,
they should have released the Regency sourcebook just after FF&S,
and followed that up with a sourcebook on the pre-Rebellion era.

   But I have not come here to bury GDW or to praise it (sorry Wil).  The
TNE game mechanics (separate from the background) are some of the
best in the gaming industry.  They are the best of all the sci-fi RPGs out
there, _including_ MegaTraveller/Classic Traveller.  They are well
balanced, giving you detail without necessarily killing you with it.  It is
possible to use the game never designing a single vehicle or starship,
or handcrafting every vehicle your PCs encounter.  We can debate
the things that perhaps it does not do as well as it should (e.g. a total
lack of sniper rules, not enough ``plug it in`` modules to ease ship
design when you are math/time challenged), but those flaws are not
game killers and can be easily addressed.  Should Marc Miller make the
decision to go with slightly revised TNE game mechanics in the next
version of Traveller, I think he\'ll find that he made an excellent choice.

   As to what constitutes ``Real Traveller``, simply open the book and
look for ``copyright Game Designers\' Workshop`` or ``copyright GDW``.
That\'s your sign it\'s real Traveller.  When FarFuture Enterprises (Marc
Miller\'s company that will be producing Traveller products from my
understanding) begins publishing, then that will be ``real Traveller`` as
well.

   So changing to yet another system will bring people back?  If I am
reading Marc Miller correctly in his posts here, the new system he is
contemplating will _not_ be completely compatible with any of the
previous systems.  It will be, in essence, a second attempt at
MegaTraveller without the Rebellion as its primary focus.

   Ah, now we are getting to the heart of ``why TNE?``.  MegaTraveller
from its inception was a farmed out piece of work.  We can only
speculate as to what the problems were on DGP\'s end--too small of an
operation to handle a project this big, poor quality control, etc.--the fact
is that GDW could have caught all the problems with MT and did not,
and for that they took responsibility a long time ago.

   GDW\'s overall sales were in decline for a protracted period _before_
TNE was introduced.  TNE therefore represented an attempt to revive
sales and to a certain extent restore the good name Traveller once had.
GDW determined that a fresh start was needed, so Frank Chadwick,
Dave Nilsen et. al. came up with the concept of the ``Star Vikings``,
and talked extensively with Traveller players about what they did and
did not like about the old systems.  TNE was the result.

   So why didn\'t TNE revive sales as GDW hoped?  There were of
course market factors involved (competition, business cycles, etc.),
but _I_ think the biggest factor was that the post-Collapse background
simply turned the bulk of Traveller fans off.  Sure, people grumbled
a bit about the new game mechanics at first (this is normal), but to
those players who had run campaigns for literally _years_ in the same
area, only to be told that region of space had just been trashed by a
super weapon, was just too much to take.  IMHO, had the new game
mechanics been introduced with a post-Rebellion ``the Imperium\'s seen
better days but it\'s recovering nicely`` background, we would not be
here talking about the demise of GDW and ``where the heck do we go
next with the story line?``

>I think going back to the MT system would be a good  move so long as it
>is fixed up a bit and the rule book is *thouroughly* proof-read.

   And _thoroughly_ spell checked too. <G>  I\'m not so sure that this is
a good idea, since the problem with the last system (TNE) wasn\'t the
game mechanics.   Let\'s put it this way: the problem was not the boat, it
was the oarsmen, so why go to all the trouble of building a new boat?

>Having said this, I have to agree with Jerry that the important thing is to
>keep Traveller alive, in whatever form.

   _That_ my friend is the most important thing of all.  It will do the TNEers
little good to lose this debate and then lose Traveller entirely because
they went out and campaigned against the new version.  We could
debate the true loyalties of those people who sat out TNE and nitpicked
it, but it\'s a can of worms that is better off left on the shelf.

>People should be prepared to accept the fact that no one is going to get

   Well you can\'t always get what you want.  But if you try sometimes,
you just might find, you get what you need.

>here, no?

   No.  Though it is apparent that Marc Miller has some preconceptions
about what he would like the FarFuture Enterprises release of Traveller
to be, nothing is set in stone.  The time for those of us who want to
keep the TNE game mechanics in place to speak is now, not after
everything has gone to print.  I refuse  to become a complete
curmudgeon and start up a mailing list separate from the one that
_normal_ Traveller players use.

   I have only one thing to ask anyone who would advocate using 3D
space in Traveller without a computer:

   _Are you nuts?!!_

   Aside from the problems you point out above, 10 x 10 x 5 parsec
hexes aren\'t large enough.  You have stars in relatively close
proximity to Earth in the X and Y coordinate that are over 10 parsecs
away in the Z coordinate (Beta Hydri being one).  That doesn\'t even
include the lovely possibility of having stars that are _way_ over 10
parsecs (try 20, 30 or more) away from each other in the Z coordinate
in some other part of Imperial space.

   Those of us who developed eye strain and carpel tunnel syndrome
from all the typing we did on our calculators trying to play 2300 AD
like the old fashion 2D maps just fine, thank you very much.

   Now having slam dunked you, let me say that I would love an _easy
to use_ 3D space map.  It should be  inexpensive (less than $30 US),
Windows/Macintosh compatible, and be able to show me the stars in 3D,
giving me distances to from any given star system to the any other
given star system simply by pointing and clicking.  A nice additional
feature would be something that would give me all the star systems
that are within range of my starship, given its jump capacity and the
name of a given star system.

   I take it you\'re still listening Mr. Miller....

Wow, the debate is in full swing I see. Here\'s a few more credits worth
from me.  I agree that the new setting is what alienated a bunch of old
players, not the mechanics.  Personally, I don\'t mind having a TNE
setting out there, because if I don\'t like it, I won\'t use it (hell, if
I go to the trrouble of playing out my own version of FFW, you can tell
I take the nitty-gritty history as a guideline :-)

The problem as I see it is where mechanics changes void too much of the
background.  In the 3d map debate, I\'d weigh in on the side of 3d if it
doesn\'t void background----non-trivial in this case.  The way to do it is
to call the old maps maps of jumpspace, and still valid.  There might
even be systems all around that aren\'t on the map----why?  Because they
aren\'t accessable in a "normal" way through Jspace.  This will not only
add 3 space, it\'ll add unexplored worlds right inside the Imperium!  You
need to go sublight to get to them (there must be some hand-waving to do
about why some places are blocked in Jspace).  That or it would be the
subject of Imperial study (can you say "safe staging areas").  But I
digress.

The TNE mechanics are OK by me, I like the task system, and prefer d20
for the simple fact that I have a better feel for the %s than with 2d6.
Mechanics doesn\'t change the background, though.  Technology does.  Keep
the parts of FFS that work, fix the other bits so they look more like
the tech you\'d expect.

There\'s already some of that happening, although nothing organized.
I\'ve been keeping archives of all the starships & such posted to the
TML, GDW-Beta, and elsewhere that I can find. Most of these are
complete designs, but there\'s a number of designs for "lasers" or
such. For example, I have in the archives a design for a TL14 700Mj Laser...

If we stick with FFS, then there\'s already quite a collection of
interesting pieces out there...

It\'s a minor comment on page 21 of the BL rules, "Larger damper

Okay.  I promised I was going somewhere with this question.  Here goes.

Every now and then I contemplate running a "Traveller flavored" GURPS
game.  Now, I bought the Hiver / Ithklur supplement ("Aliens of The
Rim") used; I paid about six bucks for it.  The description of Hiver
society was interesting.  Some of the writing was AMAZING.  (The
sidebar containing a Hiver\'s take on human historical fiction, for
example.)  The commentary on the Mechnod Hello was to the point, and
built well on "known facts" about the Hivers.  If I ever do run my
Traveller flavored game, the material will be useful.  It fufills the
purpose of a gaming supplement: it expands on material already
presented, giving additional useful and intriguing information for
those who wish to emphasize that aspect of the game world in their own
games.

BUT.

Ignoring, for the moment, the fact that the Ithklur were designed to
be FUN, rather than reasonable-- hey, it\'s your game, play a cheerful
Monty-Python quoting homocidal anarchist lizard clad in a Santa hat
and Hawaiian shirt if you want to; have a whole race of the blasted
things, see if I care-- their inclusion was VERY badly retconned.

The supplement states that Ithklur are acknowledged to be the most
fearsome warrior race known, explicitly denigrating the Vargr and
Aslan.  Now, that\'s the sort of thing I do NOT want to see if I have a
running campaign.  I can just see this exchange:

     "OK, Hreiehiu, this Ithklur gets in your way."
     "How big?"
     "Medium size."
     "I knock it aside and continue on my way."
     "Are you sure?  It\'s much bigger than you are."
     "Eh?  You said it was medium sized."
     "For an Ithklur.  Two, two and a quarter meters."
     "What, it\'s some giant sentient HERBIVORE I haven\'t heard of?"
     "No, it\'s part of the Hive Federation.  Reptillian.  THE most
fearsome warriors known-- much scarier than any other species."
     "YAK DUNG!  I\'m a sodding ASLAN!  I bloody ATE half a platoon of
Solomani guerillas LAST week ALONE!!"
     "Pfaugh.  Naah, Ithklur are much tougher.  Says so right here.
Oh, and this one\'s looking at you.  It says `Transylvania 6-5000!\' and
bonks you on the head."
     "Stephan, this is a joke, right?  You\'re messing with me, like
the time I took the panel off a navigation computer and you said there
was a Droyne inside, with an abacus."
     "No, it\'s for real.  Right now it\'s silly-walking around you."
     "I get it!  First contact!  The Hivers let a new race join the
Federation, and they\'re particularly strange."
     "No, they\'re the first race the Hivers ever met.  Incidently,
this one takes a paperweight out of its pocket and shakes it,
mesmerized by the falling snow."


Folks, it ain\'t no wonder GDW is shutting down.  Even granting the
premise that The New Era was a good marketing move-- even I will admit
that it added flavor / variety / an excuse to generate a round of
supplements-- the supplements themselves did not provide good return
on the investment.  At least a quarter of the page-count of the Hiver
/ Ithklur supplement was devoted to character generation rules;
there\'s a Big Ouch right there.  The tone shifted wildly from one race
to the other: conspiracy nuts have no use for comic relief killer
lizards, and the only thing the happy bang-bang powergamers want to
know about Hivers is whether they writhe more in Willy Pete or napalm.
What\'d the thing retail for, twelve dollars US?  I would have been
SICK if I\'d paid that much for it.

The supplement directly contradicted What Had Gone Before It.
Everybody and his Vargr knows that the K\'kree are the most deadly
SPECIES humaniti has contacted, with the Aslan topping the charts on
the INDIVIDUAL scale. But then, here comes this chirruping little
tome, that hands the honor to CORN-DOG EATING IGUANAS.

This is not a "mistake."  GURPS Fantasy II was a mistake-- a
gloriously detailed, intriguing gameworld that was fundamentally
unplayable.  GDW\'s handling of the Traveller line can only be
described as "bungling."

Marc Miller\'s list of What He\'d Like to See for Traveller concentrates
on the wrong things.  The FIRST thing that needs doing is a single man
needs to sit down and comb through the existing works and decide what
the canon should be.  And once you\'ve established canon, STICK TO IT.

Bah.  I\'m rambling.  I\'m getting passionate about a game background
whose politics depends on a 2D map of a 3D galaxy.  With a beam like
that in yer eye, yelling about lizard-shaped motes is fairly
pointless.

It\'s just... I wish there was something I could do about the Beowulf...

Okay, I\'m responding to both the list and the address in the mail.

I have this to say about Traveller history, warriors, et al.  The
K\'kree are the most bloodthirsty race that humaniti has ever made
contact with.  They aren\'t the most powerful warriors.  However, they
are the most militant, the most ruthless, and definitely very, very
cunning.  Just because you\'ve got the highest body count because
you\'ve exacted the greatest amount of brute force still doesn\'t make
you the best killer, just the biggest.

H&I states that the Ithklur are the single best race of warriors.  It
portrays them as efficient, lethal, artists.  They don\'t erradicate
entire species because they like beef!  They fight to create a mood
and setting, just like any other artist who creates art.

As for the Santa hat.  I like it.  Makes you wonder just how much

Here, here!  While were writing out our Trav wish lists for MM to
fill, let\'s add the resurrection of the 2300AD setting!  And how about a
sourcebook for one of the arms that the Kafer\'s _don\'t_ trash.
Has anyone noticed a trend with GDW games?  In Twilight the world
starts out trashed, in 2300AD the Kafers trash it, in CT the Rebellion
and then Virus trash it, in Dark Conspiracy creatures from other
dimensions trash it....  What\'s with the apocolyptic obsession?  Maybe
they were predicting their own demise. ;-)

        I\'m weary of this whole debate. GDW, who was the copyright holder,
named the game TRAVELLER The
New Era. That makes it Traveller. It has the SAME background as all previous
versions of the game, merely advanced in the timeline. Yes, it has a
different system; so what? TRAVELLER has always been more background than
system. You may not like the direction that the background took (I wasn\'t
terribly fond of the Rebellion myself) but it\'s still Traveller, because
those responsible for producing it SAID it was! When Marc Miller
puts out a new edition, whatever that may be, THAT will be Traveller!
        When Traveller does come back, you better hope it does so with a
state-of-the-art 1990\'s era system, or you\'ll be mourning it\'s death again
before long. Classic Traveller belongs to the 1970\'s; there it should
remain. TNE may have had flaws, but at least it looked and played like
TODAY\'S RPG\'s.

    'body' => '     It has become increasingly obvious to me that the new Traveller is
going to be based on the original system, but with, as Mr. Miller put it "20
years of roleplaying experience"  added in. With almost that much
experience myself, here\'s what I think those "upgrades" should entail:
        1.) Improved Character Generation rules that keep the flavor of
CT/MT character creation while skipping the Survival roll (it can be assumed
the PC\'s ARE survivors or they\'d never be PC\'s in the first
place) and allowing for MORE SKILLS!! (7-8 levels per average character
simply is not enough in comparison to other games that have skill systems.)
And perhaps Advantages and Disadvantages (in some fashion) to help flesh out
personality!
        2.) A skill system which is less broad; I personally feel that the
level of detail in the TNE skill system is about right, as is the basic
ratio of 2 new levels for each 1 old level.
        3.) A task system! The somewhat maligned MT task system was actually
not that bad. I have seen worse, and no less a source than Steve Jackson
once said he thought it was good. (Steve is one of my gaming gurus.)
        4.) A combat system with a degree of realism but still relatively
easy to use. Again, MT didn\'t do too bad in this department. At least we got
away from Battle Dress making you harder to hit! That kind of abstraction is
"creeping D&D-ism" from the seventies that we can do without!
        5.) An abstracted space combat system that requires nothing but pen,
paper, and imagination. The system as presented in the Mk1, Mod1 rulebook
for TNE could, with very little trouble, be reworked for the new game. I
of course also would like to see a tactical ship combat game with the level
of detail of Brilliant Lances, but with Mayday-style movement.
        6.) Vehicle design systems that WORK and are fairly easy to use. I
do NOT want to see a repeat of the
MegaTraveller Generic Vehicle Design Charts. FF&S should simply be
translated to the new rules, the reality errors fixed, and away you go! Put
the design rules for STARSHIPS and ROBOTS in the core rules, and leave the
rest for the supplement.
        As much as I enjoy TNE, I agree that GDW erred seriously in not
making it easy to convert systems.
I agree wholeheartedly with the ideas expressed for a conversion appendix;
it is absolutely vital, especially
to bring TNE players in.
        What I want to see is a system which uses the best parts of TNE and
MT (which, in terms of it\'s basic
design, was an improvement over CT), with new goodies added as well.

I am not sure one could say that the Kafers "trashed" the French Arm.  There
was a war.  For a while the nations of Earth were losing, then they started
winning.  If anything, since 2300 was the T2k setting +300 years, there is a
message of hope in there.

Then again, there was the "death watch" program junk put out at the end...

    'body' => 'OK, I bitched about the tech problems that exist in the currently existing
Traveller world-view (and what I still think is the dead end of FFS, even
excepting its un-necessary level of obtuseness in design), now, just to
show what a little bit of creative thinking can achieve -- the reasons *why*
the Imperium is such aa backward place!

There are actually two (related) reasons --

1) The reason for Terra\'s defeat of the Ziru Sirka at the end of the Nth
Interstellar war, and

2) The Terran Federation\'s *loss* of the Nth Interstellar war

(and, no, the above two statements are *not* mutually exclusive - bear with
me for a while!)

How to Win a Modern War

Here we are making certain important assumptions - that "modern" wars mean
full scale conventional wars rather than guerilla actions and the sort of
civil disorder that is masquerading as "war" in Africa and (to a great
degree) Bosnia and Chechnya; and that they are, ultimately *Total War* (i.e.
they are wars to the "death" ... or the destruction/conversion of one side
by the other).

Given this, and assuming that the US Civil War is the first of the modern
"Total Wars" (the Napoleonic wars don\'t quite cut the mustard here), then it
can easily be seen that the winning side is always the side that has the
largest and strongest economy. This was the case in the Civil War, WW1 and
WW2.

Now, although the initial Interstellar Wars were fought by Terra against
the local Provincial Governor on the Imperial Rim, by the end they were
occupying the whole attention of the Ziru Sirka. Given that, then the Terran
Federation would have lost. It doesn\'t matter that they may have had
access to more advanced technologies, they would have succumbed to Imperial
mass in the same way the Germans had better tanks but could not stand up to
US tanks simply because the US had many more than the Germans did (being
simplistic here). It doesn\'t matter that the Terrans had *some* vessels that
had the advantage of better JDrives (it is unlikely that they would have
been able to re-equip the entire fleet with brand new ships!), they *still*
would have lost.

Accepted that as a reasonable assumption? Well, then, *how* in the hell did
the Terran Federation win? The answer is simple -- *they* actually
outproduced the Ziru Sirka!!! How? Simple, there seems to be an assumption
all through Traveller (in prices of equipment and services, in all the
design rules, and in all the supplementary material) that the Imperium has
an industry that is basically the same as that of *here and now*. That is,
basically manpower intensive (after all, we are assuming a civilisation
some 3000 years in the future here -- the exact opposite should be true, tho,
of course, the term is quite relative)! In other words, most people go off
to work in factories that, apart from producing high-tech goods, are not
too different from those today.

This is quite ridiculous. Why would it be the case ... well, we know from
assorted source material that in both the Imperium and the Solomani sphere
there are anti-robot forces that have forced this on both governments. Or
so it is suggested!! This is not *entirely* true - the real truth is that
the inherently conservative Vilani social structure has rejected anything
more advanced (how does this affect the Solomani? bear with me).

The Terrans of the Nth Interstellar War period, however, had no such qualms
and produced increasingly highly roboticised factories that, at the end,
effectively became half Von Neumann machines (i.e. capable of producing
anything less complex than themselves) and, *right* at the end, *full*
Von Neumann machines (capable of reproducing even themselves). These autofacs
mined their own resources, refined the ores and chemicals, and produced the
finished products on demand, all without any (or much) human intervention.
Productivity was vastly more than it is now in 1996 (or is in the 6th
millennia of the Imperium), 100 fold, 1000 fold, 10000 fold? More? Regardless,
the Terran Federation were able to swamp the Imperials with tech at the
"cutting edge" and beyond that only they could afford to produce in bulk.

*That\'s* how they defeated the Vilani.

2) How the Terran *Federation* lost the Nth Interstellar War.

But I just explained how they beat the Vilani ... !!! Note the wording
carefully *beat the Vilani* ... NOT *won the Nth Interstellar War*. This
is important.

We know from Megatraveller (Imperial Encyclopaedia) and other Traveller
material (especially re the Psionics Institutes) that the Imperium has no
qualms about, and a long record of, manipulating the truth to turn the
whole of "accepted" history into nothing less than an organised lie.

Thus, the Terran Federation *did* lose the Nth Interstellar War even tho
they *did* defeat the Vilani! How? Simple, the Terran Federation - the
democratically elected government of the Terran Sphere - were betrayed by
bloody-handed fascist militarists under Admiral Estigaribbia!

The fleet elements that supported the fascists could not have been enough
to force the Federation to accept their rule on a long term basis -- a
significant proportion, probably a majority, would have remained loyal
to the civilian government -- so they needed assistance. And who offered
it to them? Who did these elitists have more in common with , the
democrats or the Vilani aristocrats? Answer\'s simple - they got the support
of the Vilani aristocrats and Megacorps, as well as the troops and ships to
enable them to occupy the key worlds of the Terran sphere with Vilani
forces to keep the majority of ordinary Terrans who loathed the military
plotters under "control".

What was the price for this assistance? Well, neither the Vilani Megacorps
(who would have been run out of business) nor the Vilani bureaucrats liked
the idea of technology run rampant, social disruption, and uncontrolled
change that the Autofacs represented, so they demanded that all the *really*
advanced models be destroyed. The Admiral and his lackeys agreed - as,
after all, *they* didn\'t want their precarious hold on power disrupted by
some new tech development either!

So, there we have it! The Imperial Data Packet is intended to *restrict*
the spread of technology, *not* foster it! The laughably stupid way in
which it rates technology is a deliberate ploy by the Imperial manipulators
to get the populace to accept some basically identical technologies as
*different*, to think of really outrageous technologies as "doable", and
generally have a distorted view of the *reality* of tech development. After
all, if you can manipulate the way a man thinks, that\'s a whole hell of
a lot better than fighting him.

3) How about the Solomani? Well, the Vilani occupation forces were *all over*
the Terran sphere, and they didn\'t just "go away" ... there was resistance
to the Imperials for generations. Thus, when the "Long Night" fell, there
were substantial Vilani populations on all the Solomani planets -- and they
felt the need to identify themselves with the locals during that period of
chaos, and so adopted Terran names and faked their backgrounds.

They were so entrenched in control of the bureaucracies of the Solomani
planets that they were exceptionally successful in doing so - and they
have remained successful to the present day! In fact, many of the senior
leaders of the Solomani Party are close to pure Vilani in genetic terms,
and they *know* it ... the whole "Solomani Supremacy" rubbish is more
about the power it gives them to take on the Imperium and be big fish in
a little pond (as opposed to little ones in a big pond) than anything
else!

See what a little paranoid conspiracy theory can do with the stuffed Tech
rating system? And *all* of the above either fits the "facts" as already
known or, where they may be minor discrepancies, this can be passed off as
the Imperial manipulation of the truth. And it all makes a weird sort of
logical sense.

   Aside the tragic loss of GDW, I fear that there is another victim as
well: the TNE game mechanics.  To many Traveller fans, the TNE source
information and background are tied totally to the game mechanics.  This
was never intended to be the case.  TNE was conceived of as the basis
for a whole series of sourcebooks dealing with non-post-Collapse
settings and even alternative universes (FF&S didn\'t include all that
alternative technology just for variety\'s sake).  Perhaps in some ways
it was _too_ flexible, as more than one person I have talked to uses the
TNE game mechanics with their pre-1117 Spinward Marches campaign
(some have even went on past 1117 ignoring the Rebellion and Collapse
completely).  If GDW was guilty of anything in that regard, it was in
not ``keeping a finger up in the wind`` and adapting to the marketplace.
Instead of _yet_ another sourcebook on the Reformation Coalition,
they should have released the Regency sourcebook just after FF&S,
and followed that up with a sourcebook on the pre-Rebellion era.

   But I have not come here to bury GDW or to praise it (sorry Wil).  The
TNE game mechanics (separate from the background) are some of the
best in the gaming industry.  They are the best of all the sci-fi RPGs out
there, _including_ MegaTraveller/Classic Traveller.  They are well
balanced, giving you detail without necessarily killing you with it.  It is
possible to use the game never designing a single vehicle or starship,
or handcrafting every vehicle your PCs encounter.  We can debate
the things that perhaps it does not do as well as it should (e.g. a total
lack of sniper rules, not enough ``plug it in`` modules to ease ship
design when you are math/time challenged), but those flaws are not
game killers and can be easily addressed.  Should Marc Miller make the
decision to go with slightly revised TNE game mechanics in the next
version of Traveller, I think he\'ll find that he made an excellent choice.

   As to what constitutes ``Real Traveller``, simply open the book and
look for ``copyright Game Designers\' Workshop`` or ``copyright GDW``.
That\'s your sign it\'s real Traveller.  When FarFuture Enterprises (Marc
Miller\'s company that will be producing Traveller products from my
understanding) begins publishing, then that will be ``real Traveller`` as
well.

   So changing to yet another system will bring people back?  If I am
reading Marc Miller correctly in his posts here, the new system he is
contemplating will _not_ be completely compatible with any of the
previous systems.  It will be, in essence, a second attempt at
MegaTraveller without the Rebellion as its primary focus.

   Ah, now we are getting to the heart of ``why TNE?``.  MegaTraveller
from its inception was a farmed out piece of work.  We can only
speculate as to what the problems were on DGP\'s end--too small of an
operation to handle a project this big, poor quality control, etc.--the fact
is that GDW could have caught all the problems with MT and did not,
and for that they took responsibility a long time ago.

   GDW\'s overall sales were in decline for a protracted period _before_
TNE was introduced.  TNE therefore represented an attempt to revive
sales and to a certain extent restore the good name Traveller once had.
GDW determined that a fresh start was needed, so Frank Chadwick,
Dave Nilsen et. al. came up with the concept of the ``Star Vikings``,
and talked extensively with Traveller players about what they did and
did not like about the old systems.  TNE was the result.

   So why didn\'t TNE revive sales as GDW hoped?  There were of
course market factors involved (competition, business cycles, etc.),
but _I_ think the biggest factor was that the post-Collapse background
simply turned the bulk of Traveller fans off.  Sure, people grumbled
a bit about the new game mechanics at first (this is normal), but to
those players who had run campaigns for literally _years_ in the same
area, only to be told that region of space had just been trashed by a
super weapon, was just too much to take.  IMHO, had the new game
mechanics been introduced with a post-Rebellion ``the Imperium\'s seen
better days but it\'s recovering nicely`` background, we would not be
here talking about the demise of GDW and ``where the heck do we go
next with the story line?``

>I think going back to the MT system would be a good  move so long as it
>is fixed up a bit and the rule book is *thouroughly* proof-read.

   And _thoroughly_ spell checked too. <G>  I\'m not so sure that this is
a good idea, since the problem with the last system (TNE) wasn\'t the
game mechanics.   Let\'s put it this way: the problem was not the boat, it
was the oarsmen, so why go to all the trouble of building a new boat?

>Having said this, I have to agree with Jerry that the important thing is to
>keep Traveller alive, in whatever form.

   _That_ my friend is the most important thing of all.  It will do the TNEers
little good to lose this debate and then lose Traveller entirely because
they went out and campaigned against the new version.  We could
debate the true loyalties of those people who sat out TNE and nitpicked
it, but it\'s a can of worms that is better off left on the shelf.

>People should be prepared to accept the fact that no one is going to get
>exactly what they want.

   Well you can\'t always get what you want.  But if you try sometimes,
you just might find, you get what you need.

>variant of some sort, so we are to some degree arguing a moot point
>here, no?

   No.  Though it is apparent that Marc Miller has some preconceptions
about what he would like the FarFuture Enterprises release of Traveller
to be, nothing is set in stone.  The time for those of us who want to
keep the TNE game mechanics in place to speak is now, not after
everything has gone to print.  I refuse  to become a complete
curmudgeon and start up a mailing list separate from the one that
_normal_ Traveller players use.

   I have only one thing to ask anyone who would advocate using 3D
space in Traveller without a computer:

   _Are you nuts?!!_

   Aside from the problems you point out above, 10 x 10 x 5 parsec
hexes aren\'t large enough.  You have stars in relatively close
proximity to Earth in the X and Y coordinate that are over 10 parsecs
away in the Z coordinate (Beta Hydri being one).  That doesn\'t even
include the lovely possibility of having stars that are _way_ over 10
parsecs (try 20, 30 or more) away from each other in the Z coordinate
in some other part of Imperial space.

   Those of us who developed eye strain and carpel tunnel syndrome
from all the typing we did on our calculators trying to play 2300 AD
like the old fashion 2D maps just fine, thank you very much.

   Now having slam dunked you, let me say that I would love an _easy
to use_ 3D space map.  It should be  inexpensive (less than $30 US),
Windows/Macintosh compatible, and be able to show me the stars in 3D,
giving me distances to from any given star system to the any other
given star system simply by pointing and clicking.  A nice additional
feature would be something that would give me all the star systems
that are within range of my starship, given its jump capacity and the
name of a given star system.

   I take it you\'re still listening Mr. Miller....

Wow, the debate is in full swing I see. Here\'s a few more credits worth
from me.  I agree that the new setting is what alienated a bunch of old
players, not the mechanics.  Personally, I don\'t mind having a TNE
setting out there, because if I don\'t like it, I won\'t use it (hell, if
I go to the trrouble of playing out my own version of FFW, you can tell
I take the nitty-gritty history as a guideline :-)

The problem as I see it is where mechanics changes void too much of the
background.  In the 3d map debate, I\'d weigh in on the side of 3d if it
doesn\'t void background----non-trivial in this case.  The way to do it is
to call the old maps maps of jumpspace, and still valid.  There might
even be systems all around that aren\'t on the map----why?  Because they
aren\'t accessable in a "normal" way through Jspace.  This will not only
add 3 space, it\'ll add unexplored worlds right inside the Imperium!  You
need to go sublight to get to them (there must be some hand-waving to do
about why some places are blocked in Jspace).  That or it would be the
subject of Imperial study (can you say "safe staging areas").  But I
digress.

The TNE mechanics are OK by me, I like the task system, and prefer d20
for the simple fact that I have a better feel for the %s than with 2d6.
Mechanics doesn\'t change the background, though.  Technology does.  Keep
the parts of FFS that work, fix the other bits so they look more like
the tech you\'d expect.

There\'s already some of that happening, although nothing organized.
I\'ve been keeping archives of all the starships & such posted to the
TML, GDW-Beta, and elsewhere that I can find. Most of these are
complete designs, but there\'s a number of designs for "lasers" or
such. For example, I have in the archives a design for a TL14 700Mj Laser...

If we stick with FFS, then there\'s already quite a collection of
interesting pieces out there...

Okay.  I promised I was going somewhere with this question.  Here goes.

Every now and then I contemplate running a "Traveller flavored" GURPS
game.  Now, I bought the Hiver / Ithklur supplement ("Aliens of The
Rim") used; I paid about six bucks for it.  The description of Hiver
society was interesting.  Some of the writing was AMAZING.  (The
sidebar containing a Hiver\'s take on human historical fiction, for
example.)  The commentary on the Mechnod Hello was to the point, and
built well on "known facts" about the Hivers.  If I ever do run my
Traveller flavored game, the material will be useful.  It fufills the
purpose of a gaming supplement: it expands on material already
presented, giving additional useful and intriguing information for
those who wish to emphasize that aspect of the game world in their own
games.

BUT.

Ignoring, for the moment, the fact that the Ithklur were designed to
be FUN, rather than reasonable-- hey, it\'s your game, play a cheerful
Monty-Python quoting homocidal anarchist lizard clad in a Santa hat
and Hawaiian shirt if you want to; have a whole race of the blasted
things, see if I care-- their inclusion was VERY badly retconned.

The supplement states that Ithklur are acknowledged to be the most
fearsome warrior race known, explicitly denigrating the Vargr and
Aslan.  Now, that\'s the sort of thing I do NOT want to see if I have a
running campaign.  I can just see this exchange:

     "OK, Hreiehiu, this Ithklur gets in your way."
     "How big?"
     "Medium size."
     "I knock it aside and continue on my way."
     "Are you sure?  It\'s much bigger than you are."
     "Eh?  You said it was medium sized."
     "For an Ithklur.  Two, two and a quarter meters."
     "What, it\'s some giant sentient HERBIVORE I haven\'t heard of?"
     "No, it\'s part of the Hive Federation.  Reptillian.  THE most
fearsome warriors known-- much scarier than any other species."
     "YAK DUNG!  I\'m a sodding ASLAN!  I bloody ATE half a platoon of
Solomani guerillas LAST week ALONE!!"
     "Pfaugh.  Naah, Ithklur are much tougher.  Says so right here.
Oh, and this one\'s looking at you.  It says `Transylvania 6-5000!\' and
bonks you on the head."
     "Stephan, this is a joke, right?  You\'re messing with me, like
the time I took the panel off a navigation computer and you said there
was a Droyne inside, with an abacus."
     "No, it\'s for real.  Right now it\'s silly-walking around you."
     "I get it!  First contact!  The Hivers let a new race join the
Federation, and they\'re particularly strange."
     "No, they\'re the first race the Hivers ever met.  Incidently,
this one takes a paperweight out of its pocket and shakes it,
mesmerized by the falling snow."


Folks, it ain\'t no wonder GDW is shutting down.  Even granting the
premise that The New Era was a good marketing move-- even I will admit
that it added flavor / variety / an excuse to generate a round of
supplements-- the supplements themselves did not provide good return
on the investment.  At least a quarter of the page-count of the Hiver
/ Ithklur supplement was devoted to character generation rules;
there\'s a Big Ouch right there.  The tone shifted wildly from one race
to the other: conspiracy nuts have no use for comic relief killer
lizards, and the only thing the happy bang-bang powergamers want to
know about Hivers is whether they writhe more in Willy Pete or napalm.
What\'d the thing retail for, twelve dollars US?  I would have been
SICK if I\'d paid that much for it.

The supplement directly contradicted What Had Gone Before It.
Everybody and his Vargr knows that the K\'kree are the most deadly
SPECIES humaniti has contacted, with the Aslan topping the charts on
the INDIVIDUAL scale. But then, here comes this chirruping little
tome, that hands the honor to CORN-DOG EATING IGUANAS.

This is not a "mistake."  GURPS Fantasy II was a mistake-- a
gloriously detailed, intriguing gameworld that was fundamentally
unplayable.  GDW\'s handling of the Traveller line can only be
described as "bungling."

Marc Miller\'s list of What He\'d Like to See for Traveller concentrates
on the wrong things.  The FIRST thing that needs doing is a single man
needs to sit down and comb through the existing works and decide what
the canon should be.  And once you\'ve established canon, STICK TO IT.

Bah.  I\'m rambling.  I\'m getting passionate about a game background
whose politics depends on a 2D map of a 3D galaxy.  With a beam like
that in yer eye, yelling about lizard-shaped motes is fairly
pointless.

It\'s just... I wish there was something I could do about the Beowulf...

Okay, I\'m responding to both the list and the address in the mail.

I have this to say about Traveller history, warriors, et al.  The
K\'kree are the most bloodthirsty race that humaniti has ever made
contact with.  They aren\'t the most powerful warriors.  However, they
are the most militant, the most ruthless, and definitely very, very
cunning.  Just because you\'ve got the highest body count because
you\'ve exacted the greatest amount of brute force still doesn\'t make
you the best killer, just the biggest.

H&I states that the Ithklur are the single best race of warriors.  It
portrays them as efficient, lethal, artists.  They don\'t erradicate
entire species because they like beef!  They fight to create a mood
and setting, just like any other artist who creates art.

As for the Santa hat.  I like it.  Makes you wonder just how much
manipulation have the Hivers done?

Charles, I also do think that TNE, were it, like 2300AD, divorced from
traveller proper, is a workable game system. It doesn\'t however, work well
for traveller, as traveller was always a firmly  "Normal-centric"
environment, and TNE  is extremely cinematic in its rules and treatments of
combat. Much like Phil\'s _Space Opera_. Not bad, just not in keeping with
traveller\'s previous incarnations. Also, it IS  a totally different game
system, where Traveller:2300/2300AD was much more closely related, albiet
still a unique game system.

and is irrelevant until you get 4 or more bodies (ships, planets, etc)
involved, as it takes 3 points to define a plane, and 4 to define a volume
(tetrahedron, like 4 sided dice).  From 6 or more, you start to really feel
the need for a 3rd dimension, but then it will add much detail and math. A
good example is SpaceMaster:StarStrike; playable in 2D, but workable in 3D.
For roleplaying purposes, 2D is usually enough. (And just for reference,
many games have had 1D space combat systems, including traveller\'s HG, Star
Wars RPG, Starships & Spacemen, and several others.)

Obviously, you didn\'t read the MT Player\'s Handbook carefully; It makes the
failed survival=out in 2yr/short term the standard. Actually gakking the
char is the OPTION in MT.

I\'m not sure I understand what your objection is Harold.  You said that 10
x 10 x 5 subsectors were not large enough.  Are the traditional 8 x 10
subsectors large enough?  If what you mean is that the depth of 5 parsecs
isn\'t enough to cover the depth of the galaxy, I completely agree.  You
simply would have several maps representing different layers of space.

Also, if one is using hex maps, there is no need to develop carpal tunnel
syndrome calculating distances.  You simply count the number of hexes
between departure and destination in the X/Y plane (i.e., like one does
with 2D Traveller), and then subtract the Z coordinate of the
destination from that of the departure world.  You then take these two
distances and consult a small table (7 x 7 cells) to find out the
pythagorean distance rounded up (if you don\'t want to use a calculator).

point out that this has NOT been true.

In the mid-80\'s, GDW Released Traveller 2300, a game supposedly set 3300
years before the CT/MT games primary timelines. As such, it was extremely
criticized. It was also "divorced" from traveller quickly, as it\'s
mechanics of spaceflight were quite different, and then married to T:2K
(which was still in its non-house system days) and renamed 2300AD. T:2K is
not a bad system. Nor, for overall system factors, is TNE. It is not,
however, an outgrowth of the system for CT/MT, where 2300AD was (albiet a
huge jump).

So I have several products that say "Traveller" on the cover, copyright GDW
on the copyright page, and have nothing to do with traveller!

as for ways to utilize CT/MT CGen for those who prefer T:NE, here is a
simple solution: use the tables for survival et al, with the result of
failed survival being a major hospitalization (9-24 months). Let the player
pick his skills from those available to that career, rather than rolling
them.

There are certain parts of TNE that I find more likely than their CT/MT
counterparts:
1) PC Ship aquisition: TNE\'s is more controllable and better for groups
than CT/MT\'s

2) FF&S. I like the breadth of tech available for design. If one isn\'t
included in 4th ed, I\'ll use 3g3 for much, and MT for the rest.

3) Contacts. I like characters having contacts from prior service. And TNE
allows them to call on one when THEY need one (or feel so).

I preferr MT CGen (basic and advanced), Vehicle and Spacevessel design
sequences, Combat and damage (no PC superiority, unlike TNE), Starting
Cash/Benefits, mass combat, task system, experience system, and general
look and feel.

But as for the look and feel of TNE, T:2K, DC, et al, I never liked the
look of the books, nor the feel of the settings. I especially dislike the
GDW House system\'s Experience system; in normal play, a character gains
more in a year of being a PC than in any 4 years of Prior service. Here\'s
the math: averageing 1 character month per session, at 4 XP per session,
with most characters alternating experience into both high and low (6+ and
3-) level skills. And I feel that the GDW House system OVERVALUES
attributes. A low score was a pain in MT; it now cripples a character. I
agree that MT undervalued attributes. But TNE\'s overvalue is all the more
apparent when one compares it to MT.

The offical Imperium is the wealthiest and largest government in Charted
Space; it has rivals, but no equals.  But what if it wasn\'t so dominant?
What if the Imperium was just one of a large number of governments, set
in a vastly expanded arena of Charted Space?  What if the Solomani kept up
their rate of technological growth from the 20th century?  What if the
Imperium wasn\'t a Vilani/Solomani union, but a federation of several
human races?

This Imperial Varient makes the following assumptions that vary from the
standard Imperial Space campagin:

A) The Vargr never really became a major force in history till rather
recently.  They\'re so busy sacking and raiding each other on Lair that
they never build the economic or technological capital to develop jump
drive (or even get past TL 4 for longer than a decade) until the Zho\'s
arrive.

B) There are no psionics in this campagin: The Zhodani Consulate exist
for a far shorter time as a result, but the Zho people expand their
cultural zone over a far greater area.

C) The Vilani Ziru Sirka also expands over a much larger area: the
Terrans never stand a chance against the First Imperium.  But they get
their revenge, and develop into something... different.

D) The Hiver/K\'Kree War ends with K\'Kree conquest of the Hive Federation.

E) The Offical timeline is shortened considerabily, since everyone
develops and expands at a more swifter, more realistic rate.

*****----

"Imperial years" are Sylean years in this universe.  A Sylean year is .941
of a Terran year.

At present (570 Imperial, c. 3467 AD) the Third Imperium consists of
about 23 sectors (all the sectors if the traditional Third Imperium,
excluding those of the Terran Sphere)

In contrast, te Ziru Sirkaa - the largest empire in Charted Space - has
44 sectors.  The two Thousand worlds covers 25 sectors.  The assorted
Zhodani states are spread over 200 sectors, but no single state is
greater than 15 sectors.  The Aslan rule 10 sectors.  The Terran Sphere -
the single most power empire in existance - is satisfied with 9 sectors.

Notable Differences

The Imperium - and the history of Charted Space - is generally younger.
In this senario, the Imperium is only 125 years old, and it\'s only been
570 years sice jump drive was locally rediscovered.

Charted Space - a.k.a. the civilized portion of the Galaxy - is still
very tiny compared to the rest of the stars, but a good deal larger than
the Offical Campagin.  In the Offical Campagin, it\'s 128 sectors total:
in this varient, it\'s 290 sectors (with the Zho\'s getting 200 secotrs of
that).  Even here, it\'s still only 145,000 systems, trivial compared to
the c. 200,000,000,000 stars (say, 80,000,000,000 systems) in the galaxy.

The Offical Imperium is essentially a pumped-up version of the Sylean
Federation, run by Solomani.  In this senario, the Third Imperium is a
federation of five human cultures,

Sylean: best described as "aristocratic cowboys".  Enjoy\'s imperialism,
        extremely individualistic, willing to fight brutally to get their
        way, and scornful of prejudice.  They have a rigourous social class
        system, but people can easily go up (and down!) the system
        depending on their actions.

Vilani: very rigid, traditionalistic, and anti-technology.  Believes in the
        caste system, but caste is decided by the Vilani family and the
        person involved, not by decent - but caste is for life.
        Currently split between Ziru Sirkaa (New Imperium) and Third
        Imperium branches.

        Zuri Sirkaa Vilani (a.k.a. "colonists Vilani") are generally more
        aggressive, more soically innovative and more anti-technology than
        their Old Vland cusions ("a.k.a. "homesystem Vilani").  Both
        branched rutinely accuse the other of being \'inventive\' (a curse in
        any Vilani society)

Illeish: the "solid rock" of the Imperium.  Stable, reliable, and
        boring.  They are of vilani decent, but have become more
        pro-technology and less casted than real Vilani

Antares: A nonVilani race.  Both militant and mystical, with strong
        idealistic tendency\'s.  Basically dislike the concept of nobility,
        but willing to put up with it.

Darrian: Tech-loving, spiritual and expansionistic.  Very fond of
        nonZhodani humans.  Are quite good at warfare, fighting Zho\'s and
        Vargr for centuries.

The fact that it [Imperial Marine Grav APC\'s] is entirely armed with
nuclear Tac missiles and a fusion gun was well-advertized thoughtout the
Imperium, and the message was clear: when the Marines arrive, the party\'s
over, and no half-measures will be taken.        - p.16

Odd about the Imperial Marine\'s aggressive decoration schemes, though.
I thought the Army - being raised locally, and coloured by local
conditions - would have the crazy paint schems, and the marines would be
"basic black", as it were.  Still, GDW\'s viewpoint is not without merit.

Also got the Guilded Lilly.  Nice adventure, and a classy way for GDW to end.

Actually, I couldn\'t understand CTCGs when they first came out - I thought
"What\'s the point?" and avoided them.  Then CTCGs for Star Trek:  The Next
Generation and SimCity came out and I thought "Cool!".  I\'ve actually
played the SimCity game now (and I\'ll be playing it again in afew hours :)
and, apart from some glaring imbalances in the rules, it\'s fun.

Why have I cut these two particular CTCGs some slack?  It\'s because I was
familiar and fond of the "original work" from which they were derived.

Now, a lot of young kids know nothing *but* CTCGs - they\'ve never even
heard of RPGs.  If a Traveller CTCG would serve to expose Traveller on the
new generation of gamers and introduce them to the role-playing side, I
would be more than happy to see it added to the arsenal of weapons used to
revive the game.

As for whether or not it will work - I\'ve now read a bit about the
mechanics of *how* these games work and I\'m *sure* that Traveller could
make a painless transition to the ranks of CTCGs.  If we didn\'t want to go
the whole hog, we could work the card came *into* the role-playing game as
an optional resolution system, and it would be very, very cool!

In the last Traveller Digest it was mentioned that there was a noticable
apocolyptic trend in the development of the game setting. I agree. Traveller
was once a very progressive game system, offering an aparently limitless
frontier of worlds and opportunities. It was a game system that inspired
what I like to call FrontierThink - the passion that drove the exploration
and taming of the Earth. Today Frontiers are not expansive frontiers like
the American West, the Orient, or the South Pacific, progressive in the
sense of enlarging mans domain. Todays Frontiers are  technological,
psychological, and scientific, making things smaller, faster, stronger, smarter.

Stick with me as I am getting to my point.

SciFi literature used to be dominated by a Progressive school of writers who
had FrontierThink of the expansive sense. Today, Scifi literature is
dominated by writing about worlds within limited physical bounds, in which
technology is unbounded. The protagonists of this genre of scifi are driven
into the unbounded realms of cyberspace, drug induced groupthought and other
realms of hyperreality, while around them the physical world wilts under the
pressure of physical bounds to expansion.

We are all aware of other RPGs that reflect the cyperpunk reality of social
decay combined with internal frontiers. Traveller appears to have taken some
of this trend onboard.  The Trend is common in may things today as we
approach the end of the millenium. The Mathusian oven of the Sahara spreads,
repressed nationalism surfaces, cats and dogs living together, and mankind
hasn\'t been to the moon in 25 years - fuck we are never gonna get off this
festering ball.

One thing is for sure. We won\'t be going outside as much as we used to -
better to stay in and hang in some hyperreality or other. Don\'t worry about
GDW, there will be another and they\'ll do fine.

>From a 1996 point of view, I wouldn\'t classify anything but the two World
Wars as "total war".  The American Civil War was nothing more than a
skirmish in comparison, but at the time, *Americans* would have thought it
to be "total war".  Don\'t even think that, during the era, those involved
in the Napoleonic Wars wouldn\'t have though that they, too, were involved
in "total war".  Compared to Imperial wars, what we\'ve had so far would
classify as nothing more than "insignificant squabbles".

"Total War(s)...are wars to the death" is a statement which is just plain
wrong.  Total war is a state where the resources of a \'country\' are geared
up and heavily focussed on resolving political differences using military
means.  This can be calculated by determining the portion of gross domestic
product expensed for military purposes and the mobilisation levels of one\'s
military forces.

Example...
A large country that uses 1% of its forces to invade a small neighbouring
country could hardly be deemed as being in a state of total war; yet if the
country that is attacked needs to mobilise 100% of its military and also
implement drastic economic changes to finance it\'s own defence (with a
corresponding effect on ALL of it\'s citizens) then no-one could possibly
deny that IT was in a state of total war.

Few wars are to the death.  Most are resolved when one side or the other
capitulates to avoid further strategic (military, economic and political)
losses.  What is required to push one side over this threshold has little
to do with how *many* conventional forces you have, rather, what they are,
how *good* they are, and how you apply them.

Example...
There was a movie made quite a few years ago which had a US aircraft
carrier sent back in time into World War II.  I think it was called the
Philadelphia Experiment.  I forget how it ended, but had the TL6 (1950s) US
military acquired unrestricted use of a single TL8 (1990s) military asset,
then the entire outcome of the war, and the history of mankind, would have
changed.  Why?  Not because the AXIS powers would have been slowly and
surely beaten into submission, but because, in quite short order, they
would have realised that they had fallen so far behind in a single,
crucial, technological field that they had virtually no chance of catching
up berfore biting the big one.  Rather than suffer any more military,
economic and political damage pursuing a lost cause - they would have
capitulated.

Take the above example and give the Germans an TL8 aircraft carrier and the
AXIS powers would have won.  Now we have victory by way of technological
superiority - not economic superiority.  Your statement that "it can easily
be seen that the winning side is always the side that has the largest and
strongest economy" is now developing a rather nasty flaw.  Added to this,
you cite the US Civil War, WW1 and WW2 outcomes as definitive proof that
economies are the be-all and end-all of military victory.  A sample size of
three can hardly generate any confidence whatsoever in such a statement.
Besides, I could argue that technological advances such as railroads,
machine-guns and cryptography had as much to do with winning those three
wars as the entire economic equation.

A strong economy won\'t automatically result in a strong military and hence
military victory.  A strong economy does, however, allow research and
development to occur in technological fields that enhance military units
and, in that way, increases the chance of military success (or allows the
chances for military success to be maintained with a smaller amount of
technologically superior military units).  This allows a country with a
smaller economy (with a large R&D investment) to militarily out-perform a
country with a larger economy (but a small R&D investment).

Technology rules, and a government that best facilitates the development of
new technologies (by way of micro-economic reform) and encourages
individual though and action (by way of social reform), will eventually
hone the sharpest blade with which to deal with foreign policy.

Charles, I also do think that TNE, were it, like 2300AD, divorced from
traveller proper, is a workable game system. It doesn\'t however, work well
for traveller, as traveller was always a firmly  "Normal-centric"
environment, and TNE  is extremely cinematic in its rules and treatments of
combat. Much like Phil\'s _Space Opera_. Not bad, just not in keeping with
traveller\'s previous incarnations. Also, it IS  a totally different game
system, where Traveller:2300/2300AD was much more closely related, albiet
still a unique game system.

and is irrelevant until you get 4 or more bodies (ships, planets, etc)
involved, as it takes 3 points to define a plane, and 4 to define a volume
(tetrahedron, like 4 sided dice).  From 6 or more, you start to really feel
the need for a 3rd dimension, but then it will add much detail and math. A
good example is SpaceMaster:StarStrike; playable in 2D, but workable in 3D.
For roleplaying purposes, 2D is usually enough. (And just for reference,
many games have had 1D space combat systems, including traveller\'s HG, Star
Wars RPG, Starships & Spacemen, and several others.)

Obviously, you didn\'t read the MT Player\'s Handbook carefully; It makes the

I\'m not sure I understand what your objection is Harold.  You said that 10
x 10 x 5 subsectors were not large enough.  Are the traditional 8 x 10
subsectors large enough?  If what you mean is that the depth of 5 parsecs
isn\'t enough to cover the depth of the galaxy, I completely agree.  You
simply would have several maps representing different layers of space.

Also, if one is using hex maps, there is no need to develop carpal tunnel
syndrome calculating distances.  You simply count the number of hexes
between departure and destination in the X/Y plane (i.e., like one does
with 2D Traveller), and then subtract the Z coordinate of the
destination from that of the departure world.  You then take these two
distances and consult a small table (7 x 7 cells) to find out the
pythagorean distance rounded up (if you don\'t want to use a calculator).

    'body' => 'Some claim that GDW labelling something traveller made it so. To them I
point out that this has NOT been true.

In the mid-80\'s, GDW Released Traveller 2300, a game supposedly set 3300
years before the CT/MT games primary timelines. As such, it was extremely
criticized. It was also "divorced" from traveller quickly, as it\'s
mechanics of spaceflight were quite different, and then married to T:2K
(which was still in its non-house system days) and renamed 2300AD. T:2K is
not a bad system. Nor, for overall system factors, is TNE. It is not,
however, an outgrowth of the system for CT/MT, where 2300AD was (albiet a
huge jump).

So I have several products that say "Traveller" on the cover, copyright GDW
on the copyright page, and have nothing to do with traveller!

as for ways to utilize CT/MT CGen for those who prefer T:NE, here is a
simple solution: use the tables for survival et al, with the result of
failed survival being a major hospitalization (9-24 months). Let the player
pick his skills from those available to that career, rather than rolling
them.

There are certain parts of TNE that I find more likely than their CT/MT
counterparts:
1) PC Ship aquisition: TNE\'s is more controllable and better for groups
than CT/MT\'s

2) FF&S. I like the breadth of tech available for design. If one isn\'t
included in 4th ed, I\'ll use 3g3 for much, and MT for the rest.

3) Contacts. I like characters having contacts from prior service. And TNE
allows them to call on one when THEY need one (or feel so).

I preferr MT CGen (basic and advanced), Vehicle and Spacevessel design
sequences, Combat and damage (no PC superiority, unlike TNE), Starting
Cash/Benefits, mass combat, task system, experience system, and general
look and feel.

But as for the look and feel of TNE, T:2K, DC, et al, I never liked the
look of the books, nor the feel of the settings. I especially dislike the
GDW House system\'s Experience system; in normal play, a character gains
more in a year of being a PC than in any 4 years of Prior service. Here\'s
the math: averageing 1 character month per session, at 4 XP per session,
with most characters alternating experience into both high and low (6+ and
3-) level skills. And I feel that the GDW House system OVERVALUES
attributes. A low score was a pain in MT; it now cripples a character. I
agree that MT undervalued attributes. But TNE\'s overvalue is all the more
apparent when one compares it to MT.

The offical Imperium is the wealthiest and largest government in Charted
Space; it has rivals, but no equals.  But what if it wasn\'t so dominant?
What if the Imperium was just one of a large number of governments, set
in a vastly expanded arena of Charted Space?  What if the Solomani kept up
their rate of technological growth from the 20th century?  What if the
Imperium wasn\'t a Vilani/Solomani union, but a federation of several
human races?

This Imperial Varient makes the following assumptions that vary from the
standard Imperial Space campagin:

A) The Vargr never really became a major force in history till rather
recently.  They\'re so busy sacking and raiding each other on Lair that
they never build the economic or technological capital to develop jump
drive (or even get past TL 4 for longer than a decade) until the Zho\'s
arrive.

B) There are no psionics in this campagin: The Zhodani Consulate exist
for a far shorter time as a result, but the Zho people expand their
cultural zone over a far greater area.

C) The Vilani Ziru Sirka also expands over a much larger area: the
Terrans never stand a chance against the First Imperium.  But they get
their revenge, and develop into something... different.

D) The Hiver/K\'Kree War ends with K\'Kree conquest of the Hive Federation.

E) The Offical timeline is shortened considerabily, since everyone
develops and expands at a more swifter, more realistic rate.

*****----

"Imperial years" are Sylean years in this universe.  A Sylean year is .941
of a Terran year.

At present (570 Imperial, c. 3467 AD) the Third Imperium consists of
about 23 sectors (all the sectors if the traditional Third Imperium,
excluding those of the Terran Sphere)

In contrast, te Ziru Sirkaa - the largest empire in Charted Space - has
44 sectors.  The two Thousand worlds covers 25 sectors.  The assorted
Zhodani states are spread over 200 sectors, but no single state is
greater than 15 sectors.  The Aslan rule 10 sectors.  The Terran Sphere -
the single most power empire in existance - is satisfied with 9 sectors.

Notable Differences

The Imperium - and the history of Charted Space - is generally younger.
In this senario, the Imperium is only 125 years old, and it\'s only been
570 years sice jump drive was locally rediscovered.

Charted Space - a.k.a. the civilized portion of the Galaxy - is still
very tiny compared to the rest of the stars, but a good deal larger than
the Offical Campagin.  In the Offical Campagin, it\'s 128 sectors total:
in this varient, it\'s 290 sectors (with the Zho\'s getting 200 secotrs of
that).  Even here, it\'s still only 145,000 systems, trivial compared to
the c. 200,000,000,000 stars (say, 80,000,000,000 systems) in the galaxy.

The Offical Imperium is essentially a pumped-up version of the Sylean
Federation, run by Solomani.  In this senario, the Third Imperium is a
federation of five human cultures,

Sylean: best described as "aristocratic cowboys".  Enjoy\'s imperialism,
        extremely individualistic, willing to fight brutally to get their
        way, and scornful of prejudice.  They have a rigourous social class
        system, but people can easily go up (and down!) the system
        depending on their actions.

Vilani: very rigid, traditionalistic, and anti-technology.  Believes in the
        caste system, but caste is decided by the Vilani family and the
        person involved, not by decent - but caste is for life.
        Currently split between Ziru Sirkaa (New Imperium) and Third
        Imperium branches.

        Zuri Sirkaa Vilani (a.k.a. "colonists Vilani") are generally more
        aggressive, more soically innovative and more anti-technology than
        their Old Vland cusions ("a.k.a. "homesystem Vilani").  Both
        branched rutinely accuse the other of being \'inventive\' (a curse in
        any Vilani society)

Illeish: the "solid rock" of the Imperium.  Stable, reliable, and
        boring.  They are of vilani decent, but have become more
        pro-technology and less casted than real Vilani

Antares: A nonVilani race.  Both militant and mystical, with strong
        idealistic tendency\'s.  Basically dislike the concept of nobility,
        but willing to put up with it.

Darrian: Tech-loving, spiritual and expansionistic.  Very fond of
        nonZhodani humans.  Are quite good at warfare, fighting Zho\'s and
        Vargr for centuries.

Lot\'s of good stuff in the Regency COmbat Vechile Guide. (If you\'re a
warmaster).  Favourate quote:

The fact that it [Imperial Marine Grav APC\'s] is entirely armed with
nuclear Tac missiles and a fusion gun was well-advertized thoughtout the
Imperium, and the message was clear: when the Marines arrive, the party\'s
over, and no half-measures will be taken.        - p.16

Odd about the Imperial Marine\'s aggressive decoration schemes, though.
I thought the Army - being raised locally, and coloured by local
conditions - would have the crazy paint schems, and the marines would be
"basic black", as it were.  Still, GDW\'s viewpoint is not without merit.

Also got the Guilded Lilly.  Nice adventure, and a classy way for GDW to end.

However, I personally detest collector card
games, so I would vote against that particular concept.  Though it might
potentially bring a lot of money, I don\'t think such a game would work for
Traveller (mind you, I\'m admittedly biased).

Actually, I couldn\'t understand CTCGs when they first came out - I thought
"What\'s the point?" and avoided them.  Then CTCGs for Star Trek:  The Next
Generation and SimCity came out and I thought "Cool!".  I\'ve actually
played the SimCity game now (and I\'ll be playing it again in afew hours :)
and, apart from some glaring imbalances in the rules, it\'s fun.

Why have I cut these two particular CTCGs some slack?  It\'s because I was
familiar and fond of the "original work" from which they were derived.

Now, a lot of young kids know nothing *but* CTCGs - they\'ve never even
heard of RPGs.  If a Traveller CTCG would serve to expose Traveller on the
new generation of gamers and introduce them to the role-playing side, I
would be more than happy to see it added to the arsenal of weapons used to
revive the game.

As for whether or not it will work - I\'ve now read a bit about the
mechanics of *how* these games work and I\'m *sure* that Traveller could
make a painless transition to the ranks of CTCGs.  If we didn\'t want to go
the whole hog, we could work the card came *into* the role-playing game as
an optional resolution system, and it would be very, very cool!

In the last Traveller Digest it was mentioned that there was a noticable
apocolyptic trend in the development of the game setting. I agree. Traveller
was once a very progressive game system, offering an aparently limitless
frontier of worlds and opportunities. It was a game system that inspired
what I like to call FrontierThink - the passion that drove the exploration
and taming of the Earth. Today Frontiers are not expansive frontiers like
the American West, the Orient, or the South Pacific, progressive in the
sense of enlarging mans domain. Todays Frontiers are  technological,
psychological, and scientific, making things smaller, faster, stronger, smarter.

Stick with me as I am getting to my point.

SciFi literature used to be dominated by a Progressive school of writers who
had FrontierThink of the expansive sense. Today, Scifi literature is
dominated by writing about worlds within limited physical bounds, in which
technology is unbounded. The protagonists of this genre of scifi are driven
into the unbounded realms of cyberspace, drug induced groupthought and other
realms of hyperreality, while around them the physical world wilts under the
pressure of physical bounds to expansion.

We are all aware of other RPGs that reflect the cyperpunk reality of social
decay combined with internal frontiers. Traveller appears to have taken some
of this trend onboard.  The Trend is common in may things today as we
approach the end of the millenium. The Mathusian oven of the Sahara spreads,
repressed nationalism surfaces, cats and dogs living together, and mankind
hasn\'t been to the moon in 25 years - fuck we are never gonna get off this
festering ball.

One thing is for sure. We won\'t be going outside as much as we used to -
better to stay in and hang in some hyperreality or other. Don\'t worry about
GDW, there will be another and they\'ll do fine.

>From a 1996 point of view, I wouldn\'t classify anything but the two World
Wars as "total war".  The American Civil War was nothing more than a
skirmish in comparison, but at the time, *Americans* would have thought it
to be "total war".  Don\'t even think that, during the era, those involved
in the Napoleonic Wars wouldn\'t have though that they, too, were involved
in "total war".  Compared to Imperial wars, what we\'ve had so far would
classify as nothing more than "insignificant squabbles".

"Total War(s)...are wars to the death" is a statement which is just plain
wrong.  Total war is a state where the resources of a \'country\' are geared
up and heavily focussed on resolving political differences using military
means.  This can be calculated by determining the portion of gross domestic
product expensed for military purposes and the mobilisation levels of one\'s
military forces.

Example...
A large country that uses 1% of its forces to invade a small neighbouring
country could hardly be deemed as being in a state of total war; yet if the
country that is attacked needs to mobilise 100% of its military and also
implement drastic economic changes to finance it\'s own defence (with a
corresponding effect on ALL of it\'s citizens) then no-one could possibly
deny that IT was in a state of total war.

Few wars are to the death.  Most are resolved when one side or the other
capitulates to avoid further strategic (military, economic and political)
losses.  What is required to push one side over this threshold has little
to do with how *many* conventional forces you have, rather, what they are,
how *good* they are, and how you apply them.

Example...
There was a movie made quite a few years ago which had a US aircraft
carrier sent back in time into World War II.  I think it was called the
Philadelphia Experiment.  I forget how it ended, but had the TL6 (1950s) US
military acquired unrestricted use of a single TL8 (1990s) military asset,
then the entire outcome of the war, and the history of mankind, would have
changed.  Why?  Not because the AXIS powers would have been slowly and
surely beaten into submission, but because, in quite short order, they
would have realised that they had fallen so far behind in a single,
crucial, technological field that they had virtually no chance of catching
up berfore biting the big one.  Rather than suffer any more military,
economic and political damage pursuing a lost cause - they would have
capitulated.

Take the above example and give the Germans an TL8 aircraft carrier and the
AXIS powers would have won.  Now we have victory by way of technological
superiority - not economic superiority.  Your statement that "it can easily
be seen that the winning side is always the side that has the largest and
strongest economy" is now developing a rather nasty flaw.  Added to this,
you cite the US Civil War, WW1 and WW2 outcomes as definitive proof that
economies are the be-all and end-all of military victory.  A sample size of
three can hardly generate any confidence whatsoever in such a statement.
Besides, I could argue that technological advances such as railroads,
machine-guns and cryptography had as much to do with winning those three
wars as the entire economic equation.

A strong economy won\'t automatically result in a strong military and hence
military victory.  A strong economy does, however, allow research and
development to occur in technological fields that enhance military units
and, in that way, increases the chance of military success (or allows the
chances for military success to be maintained with a smaller amount of
technologically superior military units).  This allows a country with a
smaller economy (with a large R&D investment) to militarily out-perform a
country with a larger economy (but a small R&D investment).

Technology rules, and a government that best facilitates the development of
new technologies (by way of micro-economic reform) and encourages
individual though and action (by way of social reform), will eventually
hone the sharpest blade with which to deal with foreign policy.

I don\'t think this is even close to accurate.  Here is story as I see it,
based on the materials issued by GDW and answers from GDW staff:

1) There was no "divorce", as Traveller:2300 was _never_ part of the CT/MT
timeline.  GDW decided to use the term Traveller for name recognition
purposes, similar to the way Dodge recycled the old "Charger" name for a
brand-new car design in the 1980s.  Traveller was thought to have run its
course [or they wanted to kill it, take your pick], and GDW wanted to do a
hard science RPG set a little closer to home.

2) The timeline for T:2300 was married to T2k from the very beginning.  Either
in the T:2300 rulebook or Challenge (since I am at work I can\'t check) a GDW
rep (Miller, I think) explained that the T:2300 game backgound was generated
one Saturday by starting with the T2k background and gaming it out 300 years
in the future.  [This is why the French were the dominant power -- the French
player "won".]  At one point GDW was giving away sets of the rules for this
game at conventions.  As of a few years ago, they still had the handmade map
of the world in a corner of their warehouse, but no longer any copies of the
rules.

3) T:2300 had a lot of problems, not the least of which was that people
thought it was supposed to be part of the classic Traveller universe.  They
issued a second edition with a new name (2300AD) and heavily reworked
mechanics. 2300AD also included supplementary materials originally presented
in Challenge.


> But as for the look and feel of TNE, T:2K, DC, et al, I never liked

My main problem with the look of the TNE books is the fake computer screens --
they take up two much space which would have been better used presenting more
info.  I also thought the artwork was not as strong as some of the art in the
CT/MT/DGP/2300 days, at least in part due to the departure of Tom Peters for
the computer gaming industry.  (Tom\'s artwork, for example, includes the
drawing of the Fiery class escort in MegaTraveller Journal.)

My main problem with the feel of the TNE setting was the way Virus was
descibed [_not_ the concept of Virus itself].  This problem also extends to a
lot of the criticism I have heard regarding Virus.  The game takes place
several thousand years in the future, yet the computers work like our
computers (only better), and Virus and the sentient chips were explained in
present day terms.

Everytime I hear a programmer say Virus is impossible, I shudder -- as a
computer professional with ten years experience and an interest in the history
of computer science, I flashback to the founder of DEC saying there is no
market for personal computers or Bill Gates saying no one will ever need more
that 640k.  The criticism that Virus is impossible is as temporally-limited as
saying that Virus is impossible because it doesn\'t use punch cards.

I would have been much happier if Dave Nilsen had defined computers like that
discovered in Jim Hogan\'s second _Giants_ novel: Computers are blocks of
silicon or other materials using advanced principles we (20c humans) can\'t yet
understand, let along duplicate.  The programs that run on these computers
(including Virus) are created using advanced methods developed over thousands
of years.  Here\'s the cost, weight, capability, and difficulty to repair -- go
roleplay.  As long as there are no major violations of known laws of physics
(at least without a justifcation), nothing else should matter.

I just discovered the Traveller mailing lists last summer,
after being a player/gm for 20 years.   I suspect there are
massive numbers of people out there that play Traveller, and have
*no* idea yet about GDW folding, MM coming back, or DGP\'s
rebirth.

Great!  There are several dgp items I\'d like to get hold of that
are long since out of print.

Actually, yes.

If MM really does take Traveller down multiple timelines, then
there will be room for 1 or 2 *comprehensive* Traveller magazines
(probably quarterly) and several smaller specialized journals
covering the main divergent timelines.  TRAVELLER CHRONICLE looks
like 1 of the comprehensive magazines, *someone* should publish a
second one.  The specialized journals might end up being
"Fanzines", or "E-zines."

I\'d be most interested in these 3.

System and world building is a special interest of mine.  If MM
takes the game into "The Long Night" and "The First Imperium",
then exploring *new* (or at least uncharted) systems is going to
become very important.  The Traveller algorithms (and all their
official extensions) are quite dated now, and need to be updated.

Nope.  I\'ve got them all from the original magazines.

I doubt it, seeing as I\'ve got most of them.  I\'d prefer new ones
in a magazine format.


What I\'d like to see:

FF&S II, FF&S Lite, and conversion rules to get CT and MT
stuff into FF&S format.  My games us a lot of "alternate"
technology, and I loved the concept of FF&S..it\'s implementation
left some things to be desired.  I know you guys didn\'t do FF&S,
but you *could* do the second edition.

WORLD BUILDERS II and WB II on disk (DOS is still the common
denominator) to build systems.  Both my current campaigns are
running during a "long night"..not *the* Long Night..and the
players often run into systems about which they know nothing.  I
want to see algorithms that create systems that conform a little
more closely to what we think is reality.

Personally, I can supply the adventures. <g>

    'body' => '        Well, stop reading mail for a week, and see how full your mailbox
gets! Unfortunately, things are going to limit my online time for the
foreseeable future, so I wanted to say a few things real quick

        1) Despite everybody else\'s arguments, I still hate the idea of Yet
Another Rule Set. I definitely think TNE is the best overall so far. TNE was
much better quality than MT (I almost gave up on Traveller because of MT,
and I know most game stores in Southern California declined to carry it)

        2) DON\'T TAKE AWAY FF&S! I\'m a gearhead, and that\'s my favorite part
of the rules ... the idea that there\'s a consistent way to design new stuff
in detail, and have it mesh. HOWEVER, I also think the FF&S Lite idea is
great. Publish the full up detailed design rules as one supplement. Then
design a bunch of drop-in "standardized" components, and publish a
simplified design system (which _must_ be fully compatible with the detailed
one).

        In fact, I\'d like to see more detail ... example: life support. I\'ve
always assumed the standard life support in traveller was a short-term
system only, requiring recharging every few weeks. Give me more options ...
a very (day) short term, open loop system, the standard, weeklong partially
closed loop system, and levels of long-endurance closed loop systems (for
exploration vessels, generation ships, space stations, etc.).

        3) Get better distribution! Nobody around here carried much
Traveller stuff, and I\'ve given up hope on getting a copy of the RSB and
Striker II. Cripes, walk into any bookstore nowadays and you\'ll find T$R trash.

        4) DON\'T GO BACK TO THE OLD CHARACTER GENERATION SYSTEM! While the
new one is slightly better, this is also the one area I think which could
use some improvement. Ditch the fixed 4-year terms. One optional character
generation I\'d like to see is simply roll up the total number of points the
character will have, and let the PLAYER allocate them as desired to
characteristics and skills! Maybe let the player choose a career, and have
certain minimums he/she has to meet (i.e.: Doctor -- must have at least
Biology-3, Medical-6, Research-1, Liaison-1, Bureaucracy-1; or some such)

        5) I like the task system -- TNE\'s or MT\'s, actually. Both were a
simple way of resolving _everything_.

        6) Keep the combat system integrated more or less across the whole
spectrum -- I ought to be able to use the same penetration/damage system
whether I\'m firing my PGMP-12 at a person, an air/raft, or a starship, or if
I\'m using a 750Mj laser instead.

        7) BL -- keep. There are tweaks identified by the GDW-Beta list, and
it\'s going to need quite a bit of work if you change the rules (especially
FF&S) again


        My biggest opposition to a new set of rules is that -- EVERYTHING
will have to be redone, and it\'ll take that much longer. And don\'t suggest
going back to CT/MT rules again -- things like FF&S, BL, BR would still have
to be completely redone, and the old rules frankly lacked enough detail.
Finally, each succeeding set of rules increased the "pseudo" realism of the
game, which is what I liked.

        If we\'re voting, as somebody suggested, those are my votes, and I\'ll
register them with my pocketbook.

        Hallelujah! I was beginning to think I was the only one! But I\'ve
just about resigned myself to a step backward, and wondering if I should
bother mustering enough interest to check the Final Generation out ... maybe
I\'m being to premature, but that\'s where I\'m at.

        That\'s why I liked the system from World Builder\'s Handbook ... on
the other hand, a single tech level can give travellers a ROUGH idea of what

        This a good description of what I\'d like to see for FF&S lite.

PS: MilSpec is mostly on its way out for the US acquisition process. Not
that it\'s germane to the discussion, just felt like rambling on ....

Subject: Traveller\'s future
X-Listprocessor-Version: 6.0c -- ListProcessor by Anastasios Kotsikonas
X-Comment: Traveller Mailing List
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

        Well, stop reading mail for a week, and see how full your mailbox
gets! Unfortunately, things are going to limit my online time for the
foreseeable future, so I wanted to say a few things real quick

        1) Despite everybody else\'s arguments, I still hate the idea of Yet
Another Rule Set. I definitely think TNE is the best overall so far. TNE was
much better quality than MT (I almost gave up on Traveller because of MT,
and I know most game stores in Southern California declined to carry it)

        2) DON\'T TAKE AWAY FF&S! I\'m a gearhead, and that\'s my favorite part
of the rules ... the idea that there\'s a consistent way to design new stuff
in detail, and have it mesh. HOWEVER, I also think the FF&S Lite idea is
great. Publish the full up detailed design rules as one supplement. Then
design a bunch of drop-in "standardized" components, and publish a
simplified design system (which _must_ be fully compatible with the detailed
one).

        In fact, I\'d like to see more detail ... example: life support. I\'ve
always assumed the standard life support in traveller was a short-term
system only, requiring recharging every few weeks. Give me more options ...
a very (day) short term, open loop system, the standard, weeklong partially
closed loop system, and levels of long-endurance closed loop systems (for
exploration vessels, generation ships, space stations, etc.).

        3) Get better distribution! Nobody around here carried much
Traveller stuff, and I\'ve given up hope on getting a copy of the RSB and
Striker II. Cripes, walk into any bookstore nowadays and you\'ll find T$R trash.

        4) DON\'T GO BACK TO THE OLD CHARACTER GENERATION SYSTEM! While the
new one is slightly better, this is also the one area I think which could
use some improvement. Ditch the fixed 4-year terms. One optional character
generation I\'d like to see is simply roll up the total number of points the
character will have, and let the PLAYER allocate them as desired to
characteristics and skills! Maybe let the player choose a career, and have
certain minimums he/she has to meet (i.e.: Doctor -- must have at least
Biology-3, Medical-6, Research-1, Liaison-1, Bureaucracy-1; or some such)

        5) I like the task system -- TNE\'s or MT\'s, actually. Both were a
simple way of resolving _everything_.

        6) Keep the combat system integrated more or less across the whole
spectrum -- I ought to be able to use the same penetration/damage system
whether I\'m firing my PGMP-12 at a person, an air/raft, or a starship, or if
I\'m using a 750Mj laser instead.

        7) BL -- keep. There are tweaks identified by the GDW-Beta list, and
it\'s going to need quite a bit of work if you change the rules (especially
FF&S) again


        My biggest opposition to a new set of rules is that -- EVERYTHING
will have to be redone, and it\'ll take that much longer. And don\'t suggest
going back to CT/MT rules again -- things like FF&S, BL, BR would still have
to be completely redone, and the old rules frankly lacked enough detail.
Finally, each succeeding set of rules increased the "pseudo" realism of the
game, which is what I liked.

        If we\'re voting, as somebody suggested, those are my votes, and I\'ll
register them with my pocketbook.

        That\'s why I liked the system from World Builder\'s Handbook ... on
the other hand, a single tech level can give travellers a ROUGH idea of what

        This a good description of what I\'d like to see for FF&S lite.

PS: MilSpec is mostly on its way out for the US acquisition process. Not
that it\'s germane to the discussion, just felt like rambling on ....

Hmm post something to a mailing list? What a radical idea!
I subscribed to this list just before the GDW annoucement, what timing!
I don\'t really have much background playing traveller, just one
short adventure GM\'ed by my brother-in-law many years ago.
I did play GDW board games quite a bit, Dark Nebula, Imperium, Invasion Earth,
The Blood Tree Rebelion and what was that other space game about warfare
between planets in the same solar system, might have been in a binary star
system or something? (Tri-planetary?)

I recently borrowed all my brother-in-laws CT stuff, because I wanted to
borrow some ideas for a Computer SciFi RPG I\'ve been writing.
Reading through all this material got me interested in playing Traveller again.

I though I might ask the list what peoples opinions are on use of computers as
RPG aids and computer RPGs in general.

I do own a copy of MegaTraveller 1 "The Zhodani Conspiracy" computer game
which I never played much because floppy disk access was so slow on my Atari ST
computer and it was going to take forever to get the 2,000,000 cr for that
jump-2 drive you needed so you could get on with following the plot line.

It seems to me that rolling lots of dice and looking up dozens of tables
is not what RPGs are all about, they should be about interactions between
characters and the adventure.
Any automation of the game mechanics should be welcome.

Where do computer RPGs fall down?
They are a solitary game with no interaction with real people.
They often force you to follow a tightly scripted plotline.
Also you might like to have more a view about what is going on inside the
game engine

e.g. "Ace" fires his PGMP wildly and misses with plasma bolts zipping madly
      about the room because he has no energy weapons skill.


  "Venor" successfully makes use of his demolition-1 skill and blows the door.

To keep the traditional RPG flavour you might want to know how the computer
determined the result.

A lot of computer RPGs have real time combat, which turns the adventure into
an arcade-like mouse click fest.


I don\'t know if this has been raised on the list before but what about an
online traveller game played over the Internet with some suitable PC frontend
software that could resolve space and land combat, built in chat software
and a server machine with a GM pulling the strings of NPCs.

I guess this is already sort of happening with people playing on IRC and
play by e-mail but just think how much better it could be with purpose designed
software. I think this is where Marc Miller should concentrate is efforts.
I think this could be big. (I believe Origin are doing an Ultima online game.)
The front end doesn\'t have to be amazing graphically, 2D overhead view?
(Although I rather like the 3D view in the 3DO game console version of
Space Hulk, gives you some idea of what combat in Battle Dress would be like
:) )

Some more crazy computer ideas, develop some Traveller software for the Apple
Newton Message Pad PDA thingy, it\'s very portable and easy to take to
gaming group meetings. The Newton has builtin infra red comms and a Local Talk
network port. You could run a networked game of "Computer Traveller"
face to face if your players have Newtons and a bit of Local Talk cabling :)
More fun than all "3-10 players" crowding around the one PC if you are using
combat resolving software.


I\'ve ordered myself copies of TNE, BL, BR and Striker II out of curiosity
(coming surface mail so I won\'t have them for months),
also a second hand copy of MegaTraveller.

I would like some input on what other CT MT TNE materials are most useful to
have.
I haven\'t seen the MT or TNE rules yet but I think the combat damage system
in MT sounds more sensible than CT (from MT computer game) with armour reducing
damage rather than chance to hit.

I have access to: (care of brother-in-law)

       CT books 1-5
       CT supplements 2,3,4,7,9,10

I just got around to checking GEnie for the first time this year, and found
something that might interest a few people:

        To send e-mail to a GEnie address, just add @GENIE.GEIS.COM (so that

PS: No, when he refers to "continuing rumors" he\'s unfortunately not saying
this has all been a mistake. He\'s probably referring to past, untrue, rumors ...

To be really useful, we should add some sort of organisation to the
collection, say a further grouping, or an index. The grouping and/or index
should separate things into categories such as different ships systems
and weapons, much like the chapters in FFS. So your laser would be listed
under the categories Weapons, Lasers, TL14 etc. As a further improvement,
adding a search engine to the system would make it invaluable.

Mind you, this would take a LOT of work to set up and maintain. IMHO it
would need to be a group project. Obviously it would make no sense to
start this sort of thing until we know which way ship design is going...

I don\'t think anyone would argue with a modular approach, but it can be taken
too far. After all, say I wanted a jump 4 1000t ship, I need to install 10 of
the 100t designed modules. Does this approach really give any benefit over a
module designed for a 1t ship, which could then have mass/price/volume
multiplied by the displacement?

Likewise here, say I need 1050MW, I have to install 10 100MW modules and a
50MW. This has got to be more complicated than a table where the
vol/mass/price/vol of 90 days fuel are all listed per Megawatt of power for
each power plant. This way you find your power requirement, multiply all the
values for the chosen type of plant by it, and you have an easy custom
powerplant. I don\'t think the problem here is the rules as much as the way GDW
presents them (HEPlaR is probably the worst).

One major simplification which I would like to see is any subsystem where price
/mass/volume/power requirement is less than, for example 0.01
MCr/tonnes/kl/MW, to have that attribute officially listed as \'negligable\'.
On a lot of my electronics heavy designs I end up adding up columns of devices
with a total volume of a few kl, in a ship with a volume of thousands, and I am
always left thinking _why?_
These small values would add up in a probe, or a fighter, but for a streamlined
FFS optimised for Spacecraft, I think we could dispense with some of these
little details.

    'body' => 'Someone mentioned that the canonical reason for Terran victory in the Nth
Interstellar War was some sort of plague that hit the Vilani. Sorry, but
I\'ve never come across this one ... but will freely admit that I do not have
a 100% complete set of Traveller/MTrav/TNE gear ... so, *where* is it
mentioned? I have a friend who *has* as complete a set of Traveller gear
as it is possible to have, and *he* has never heard of it.

However, to be fair, "canonical" Traveller also allows Jump Missiles (2 tons),
when "canonical" Traveller *also* notes that JDrives cannot be mounted in
anything smaller than 100 tons! Even if such a plague *is* mentioned, then
we can assume that it is Rule of Man/Vilani *propaganda* history to save face
for the fact that they were outproduced and outfought by the Terrans. It seems
so much better if they succumbed to a filthy, perfidious, Terran *disease* -
those lousy Terrans weren\'t fighting fair!!!

Regardless, from what we know of the history of diseases on Terra, it seems
unlikely in the extreme that some sort of nasty Terran-originated disease
would have been such a killer that it would have enabled the Terrans to beat
the Ziru Sirka simply because of it. I would suggest that anyone who wants
to know why this is the case read "Plagues and Peoples" by William H. McNeill.

However, just consider a few facts that make the plague scenario unlikely.
One, the biggest killer in modern times, disease wise, was the so-called
Spanish Influenza which broke out at the end of WW1. It was, as I have been
given to understand by several sources, far and away the most virulent
plague of modern times ... yet it was really rather trivial in an overall
sense. Sure, a hell of a lot of people died, perhaps as many as died in WW1,
but that was peanuts.

More virulent diseases *do* exist, pneumonic plague, for example. However,
in that case, the disease is *so* virulent and *so* quick acting that it
basically kills off its human victims so quickly that it cannot spread (at
least at medieval rates of travel). Given that every Jump takes at least a
week, then such a disease would kill the entire crew of a starship while
it was in Jumpspace ... and leave no infectious material that I am aware
of that would still *be* infectious after the bodies were dead for a week
or more. Most of the really nasty diseases of modern times, things like
Ebola and AIDS, are so difficult to catch that you practically have to go
out and deliberately infect oneself.

Thus, even with something as virulent as Spanish \'Flu, the effects would
*not* be enough to win the war for the Terrans *unless* they were already
winning. (Did you know that the US Government actually continued to ship
soldiers to Europe in crowded troopships in 1917, at the height of the \'flu
outbreak, even though they *knew* that they were condemning hundreds, if
not thousands, to death as a result of putting them in the sort of enclosed
environment that guaranteed a high rate of exposure? The US provided the
troops that materially shortened the war ... and morale was evidently not
a problem despite this.)

Anyhow, given McNeill\'s evidence that almost all (if not *all*) diseases
have been crossovers from animals, and that not all such crossovers are
successful, then it seems to me that the Vilani would have encountered this
sort of problem on the thousands of worlds that they had explored and
settled prior to contact with Terra. Also, given the situation we know of
from Traveller sources re the development of human civilisation on Vland,
we can assume that there would have been mutations of bacteria normally
found on or associated with humans (and viruses, of course) that would have
made disease at least reasonably common in Vland even before contact with
other worlds. I have never been able to accept the blithe assumption that
the Vilani would be disease free and would have never developed the germ
theory of disease ... after all, they had first hand evidence of the
possibilities of such diseases from their long historical contacts with
the Droyne on their homeworld ... *and* they had an awful example of the
possibilities of germ warfare from what happened to the native Droyne in
their system when they regained contact (which is in itself doubtful -
the thought that the diseases that killed them off could have been so
specific as to only affect different racial types, *and* that they remained
unmutated for tens of thousands of years, is, frankly, garbage. Diseases
mutate over time, and many once lethal diseases are now nothing more than
a childhood nuisance, if that).

Nope, you can *still* explain away the supposed effects of this plague that
I have never heard about as a crude piece of Vilani propaganda that has
been put forth as "truth" by the RoM and current Imperium for so long that the
*true* story (my version) is not even recognised as "true".

Like I said, between my story and the certainty of Imperial manipulation of
the historical record, there\'s *nothing* that can\'t be adequately explained!

Still, I\'d like to see what the reference too this plague is!

Oh, and the damn listserver is *still* sending multiple copies of both
individual articles in the list *and* of the whole list. Is it possible that
someone could do something about it?

Which is pretty much what happened in the Gulf War.

But as to the "1990s carrier in 1941", this has been a frequent
discussion topic, with numerous variations, in various online groups.

My favorite method of using it (if you get there early enough) is to
simply send out a flight of aircraft with nuke capability, and *remove*
the Japanese attack force just as they are starting to launch the
planes for the attack. And don\'t say *anything* to Japan about it.

Even the Japanese would get rattled when a task force disappears
without a trace.

Then, as soon as you can get in range, you repeat this sort of
"disappeared without a trace" attack on the other thrusts of the war in
the Pacific. *Then* it is suggested in an understated sort of way, that
just *possibly* the Japanese might wish to reconsider their expansion.

Now consider the Traveller equivalent. It doesn\'t take all that many
tech levels for things to be "magic" as far as the folks at the lower
tech level are concerned.

  See Solomani & Aslan, page 22.  It\'s also in a Traveller\'s Digest
article on medicine, in issue #24 I believe (my collection of back issues
is in Delaware at the moment, so I can\'t be sure).  You have slightly
distorted what I said - the article states the Plague of Duskir was _one_
of a number of factors that led to Solomani victory, not the only one.
According to the article, the plague killed millions, and was eventually
brought under control.  Solomani & Aslan gives the impression that the
plague happened after the Nth War was over, but since that was written from
the point of view of the Solomani (who want to pump up their military
prowess), we can set that aside.  Of course, there is some disagreement as
to whether DGP stuff, esp. stuff in TD, is canonical.  I treat it that
way, due to the close ties between DGP and GDW - your mileage may vary.

  In my _private_ history of the Nth Interstellar War, the Plague played a
much bigger role, aided by Solomani biowar weapons that had been
genetically tailored by GenAssist.  The massive drops in population
recorded in census records were explained as errors in the record keeping
done by the incompetant Vilani bureaucracy, exposed by the more honest
Solomani who showed how the Vilani inflated numbers to get more perks from
the central government.  I worked up an adventure that involved the
discovery of records relating to GenAssists role and the player characters
being infected by a virus that required them to search for a cure on a
deadline.

  Well, all I\'ll say is that jump missles contradict other parts of the
cannon and are on balance not reasonable.  The Plague of Duskir does not
suffer from that problem.  Moreover, the section this comes from in
Solomani & Aslan is written from the Solomani point of view - why are the
cooperating in a Vilani "coverup?"

  Interesting that you mention this book - it was the basis for my
original thoughts on the Plague (and I suspect it was the source of the
Plague of Duskir being retroconned into the game).  Please note that this
book is now dated - there is more recent work out there.

  Depends on how you define "Modern" I suppose.  The death rate when
Europeans encountered Native Americans was far higher - over 90% by some
estimates.

  As the article pointed out, the Plague of of Duskir was mostly viruses
and symbiotic bacteria that were harmless to Solomani.  The Solomani
themselves were the carriers, and suffered no ill effects.  If one adds
in the genetic knowledge we know the Solomani had, biowar devices that
target only Vilani are an easy step.  There is enough genetic difference,
after all - we know that the Vilani have blood types in their population
that were not present in the Solomani population.

  This is why the Vilani were so germ-free - you\'ll recall that they and
other minor races were genetically unrelated to other plants and animals
on their home worlds, thus limiting disease vectors.

  Have to agree with you here - if nothing else a Vilani veteranarian
would have noticed it in order to keep those animals alive.  I\'d assume
that without animal models practice just lagged behind Solomani tech.

  The reason that they are childhood diseases is that all the folks who
could die from those diseases died - our ancestors are the folks who
lived and passed their immunity to us.  If ones ancestors were not
exposed (like Native Americans), seemingly trivial diseases kill.  As for
the Droyne dying of diseases that had no impact on Humans, well, they
aren\'t just a different species - they are products of a whole different
planet.  If we have a problem getting diseases from animals from our own
planet, the chance of getting one from aliens is rather remote.

  As for a disease surviving for years, viral spores can hang about in
severe environments for a long time.  Thousands of years, I don\'t know,
but a bioengineered weapon that\'s the product of tech 30+ (Grandfather to
kids: "...and STAY dead!") seems okay to me.

  Well, like most conspiracy theories that depend upon the assumption
that the conspirators have covered up all evidence of their actions, we
can\'t prove you wrong.  On the other hand, it seems to me that there are
far simpler ways of explaining things than your rather complex invention.
Don\'t get me wrong, I did enjoy reading your theory, but I\'m not convinced.

  Traveller\'s greatest strength has always been its free-form style, and I
feel that this has only been enhanced by the publication of TNE and FFS.
What other SF game lets you create Bussard Ramjets and fighters carrying
Spinal Meson guns?
  I\'ve been running a very successful TNE game for the past few months,
based on a "cold start" premise that practically wrote itself after I
bought TNE and FFS.  It concerns the survivors of the crew of a Bussard
Ramjet exploration ship, launched from Earth in 2059 and assigned to
explore neighboring star systems over the next 500 years or so.  The ship
malfunctions and is lost after leaving the system, and drifts undetected
between the stars for the next 4000 years until our heroes and heroines
finally wake up in (guess what?) the post-Collapse Era.
  This, of course, freed me from the problems of trying to convince
long-time Traveller players that the Imperium they once knew was, indeed,
dead.  Instead, the players are now busy gallivanting about the galaxy
trying to figure out what happened, who dunnit, and where the hell is
Earth.

somewhat different than Gliese\'s Preliminary Third Catalog of Nearby

SOME INTERESTING UPDATES:

..or, reality and the Hubble Space Telescope intrude on our little game.

A typo has been found on the Near Star List.  The F2V star at coordinates
<-45.0, -1.2, -20.5> identified as Alpha Crucis is in fact *Alpha Corvi*.
Alpha Crucis is further away and is a binary system containing a blue-white
subgiant, while Alpha Corvi (Gliese 455.3) is a solo F2V.  It seems likely
that the person who prepared the NSL misread the star\'s constellation
abbreviation as Cru (Crux), not Crv (Corvus), especially considering that
the preceding catalog entry (Gliese 455.2) is Eta Crucis.  "Alpha Crucis"/
Alpha Corvi is just inside the map, placed 49.5 ly from Earth by the NSL.
This typo may have affected the sector naming scheme in TRAVELLER as well.

VB 8 was once thought to have a brown dwarf companion, VB 8 B, and while
VB 8 B is not in the NSL, it did appear in an article on the Clarkesstar
system in _Travellers\' Digest_.  That magazine did a fair amount of
development in the American Arm, including two articles in #11 that opened
the Arm by placing a fictional brown dwarf, ISO 417, at <7.6, -27.2, 4.7>.

However, Hubble Space Telescope has verified the existence of Gliese 229 B,
a *real* brown dwarf.  This is equivalent to the star DM -21 1377 B, whose
system in the 2300AD world contains a Brazilian outpost on the Latin Finger
of the Chinese Arm, at the edge of human space.  Gliese 229 B has a mass of
20 to 50 Jupiters and radiates at not more than 1000 Kelvin.  The Brazilians
have something to study now!

Along similar lines, HST found another new star, Gliese 623 B, one of the
smallest stars known.  This is in the Ellis system, site of a major American
colony.  Fortunately, its\' 2 AU orbit is far enough out that all of the
fictional planets established to be in the system in the game are legal
under the star system rules.  Other vital statistics of the star include an
absolute magnitude of 16.5 or so, and 0.1 solar mass.  Gliese 623 B
shouldn\'t appear much more than twice as bright from Ellis as the Moon is
from Earth.

  You don\'t need to limit yourself to the information given by the rules
and the prehistory of the Imperium when considering a setting or starting
point for a Traveller game.  The rules (and history), after all, are only
guidelines and subject to change without notice by you, the GM.
  Traveller\'s greatest strength has always been its free-form style, and I
feel that this has only been enhanced by the publication of TNE and FFS.
What other SF game lets you create Bussard Ramjets and fighters carrying
Spinal Meson guns?
  I\'ve been running a very successful TNE game for the past few months,
based on a "cold start" premise that practically wrote itself after I
bought TNE and FFS.  It concerns the survivors of the crew of a Bussard
Ramjet exploration ship, launched from Earth in 2059 and assigned to
explore neighboring star systems over the next 500 years or so.  The ship
malfunctions and is lost after leaving the system, and drifts undetected
between the stars for the next 4000 years until our heroes and heroines
finally wake up in (guess what?) the post-Collapse Era.
  This, of course, freed me from the problems of trying to convince
long-time Traveller players that the Imperium they once knew was, indeed,
dead.  Instead, the players are now busy gallivanting about the galaxy
trying to figure out what happened, who dunnit, and where the hell is
Earth.

  See Solomani & Aslan, page 22.  It\'s also in a Traveller\'s Digest
article on medicine, in issue #24 I believe (my collection of back issues
is in Delaware at the moment, so I can\'t be sure).  You have slightly
distorted what I said - the article states the Plague of Duskir was _one_
of a number of factors that led to Solomani victory, not the only one.
According to the article, the plague killed millions, and was eventually
brought under control.  Solomani & Aslan gives the impression that the
plague happened after the Nth War was over, but since that was written from
the point of view of the Solomani (who want to pump up their military
prowess), we can set that aside.  Of course, there is some disagreement as
to whether DGP stuff, esp. stuff in TD, is canonical.  I treat it that
way, due to the close ties between DGP and GDW - your mileage may vary.

  In my _private_ history of the Nth Interstellar War, the Plague played a
much bigger role, aided by Solomani biowar weapons that had been
genetically tailored by GenAssist.  The massive drops in population
recorded in census records were explained as errors in the record keeping
done by the incompetant Vilani bureaucracy, exposed by the more honest
Solomani who showed how the Vilani inflated numbers to get more perks from
the central government.  I worked up an adventure that involved the
discovery of records relating to GenAssists role and the player characters
being infected by a virus that required them to search for a cure on a
deadline.

  Well, all I\'ll say is that jump missles contradict other parts of the
cannon and are on balance not reasonable.  The Plague of Duskir does not
suffer from that problem.  Moreover, the section this comes from in
Solomani & Aslan is written from the Solomani point of view - why are the
cooperating in a Vilani "coverup?"

  Interesting that you mention this book - it was the basis for my
original thoughts on the Plague (and I suspect it was the source of the
Plague of Duskir being retroconned into the game).  Please note that this
book is now dated - there is more recent work out there.

  Depends on how you define "Modern" I suppose.  The death rate when
Europeans encountered Native Americans was far higher - over 90% by some
estimates.

  As the article pointed out, the Plague of of Duskir was mostly viruses
and symbiotic bacteria that were harmless to Solomani.  The Solomani
themselves were the carriers, and suffered no ill effects.  If one adds
in the genetic knowledge we know the Solomani had, biowar devices that
target only Vilani are an easy step.  There is enough genetic difference,
after all - we know that the Vilani have blood types in their population
that were not present in the Solomani population.

  This is why the Vilani were so germ-free - you\'ll recall that they and
other minor races were genetically unrelated to other plants and animals
on their home worlds, thus limiting disease vectors.

  Have to agree with you here - if nothing else a Vilani veteranarian
would have noticed it in order to keep those animals alive.  I\'d assume
that without animal models practice just lagged behind Solomani tech.

  The reason that they are childhood diseases is that all the folks who
could die from those diseases died - our ancestors are the folks who
lived and passed their immunity to us.  If ones ancestors were not
exposed (like Native Americans), seemingly trivial diseases kill.  As for
the Droyne dying of diseases that had no impact on Humans, well, they
aren\'t just a different species - they are products of a whole different
planet.  If we have a problem getting diseases from animals from our own
planet, the chance of getting one from aliens is rather remote.

  As for a disease surviving for years, viral spores can hang about in
severe environments for a long time.  Thousands of years, I don\'t know,
but a bioengineered weapon that\'s the product of tech 30+ (Grandfather to
kids: "...and STAY dead!") seems okay to me.

  Well, like most conspiracy theories that depend upon the assumption
that the conspirators have covered up all evidence of their actions, we
can\'t prove you wrong.  On the other hand, it seems to me that there are
far simpler ways of explaining things than your rather complex invention.
Don\'t get me wrong, I did enjoy reading your theory, but I\'m not convinced.

Someone mentioned that the canonical reason for Terran victory in the Nth
Interstellar War was some sort of plague that hit the Vilani. Sorry, but
I\'ve never come across this one ... but will freely admit that I do not have
a 100% complete set of Traveller/MTrav/TNE gear ... so, *where* is it
mentioned? I have a friend who *has* as complete a set of Traveller gear
as it is possible to have, and *he* has never heard of it.

However, to be fair, "canonical" Traveller also allows Jump Missiles (2 tons),
when "canonical" Traveller *also* notes that JDrives cannot be mounted in
anything smaller than 100 tons! Even if such a plague *is* mentioned, then
we can assume that it is Rule of Man/Vilani *propaganda* history to save face
for the fact that they were outproduced and outfought by the Terrans. It seems
so much better if they succumbed to a filthy, perfidious, Terran *disease* -
those lousy Terrans weren\'t fighting fair!!!

Regardless, from what we know of the history of diseases on Terra, it seems
unlikely in the extreme that some sort of nasty Terran-originated disease
would have been such a killer that it would have enabled the Terrans to beat
the Ziru Sirka simply because of it. I would suggest that anyone who wants
to know why this is the case read "Plagues and Peoples" by William H. McNeill.

However, just consider a few facts that make the plague scenario unlikely.
One, the biggest killer in modern times, disease wise, was the so-called
Spanish Influenza which broke out at the end of WW1. It was, as I have been
given to understand by several sources, far and away the most virulent
plague of modern times ... yet it was really rather trivial in an overall
sense. Sure, a hell of a lot of people died, perhaps as many as died in WW1,
but that was peanuts.

More virulent diseases *do* exist, pneumonic plague, for example. However,
in that case, the disease is *so* virulent and *so* quick acting that it
basically kills off its human victims so quickly that it cannot spread (at
least at medieval rates of travel). Given that every Jump takes at least a
week, then such a disease would kill the entire crew of a starship while
it was in Jumpspace ... and leave no infectious material that I am aware
of that would still *be* infectious after the bodies were dead for a week
or more. Most of the really nasty diseases of modern times, things like
Ebola and AIDS, are so difficult to catch that you practically have to go
out and deliberately infect oneself.

Thus, even with something as virulent as Spanish \'Flu, the effects would
*not* be enough to win the war for the Terrans *unless* they were already
winning. (Did you know that the US Government actually continued to ship
soldiers to Europe in crowded troopships in 1917, at the height of the \'flu
outbreak, even though they *knew* that they were condemning hundreds, if
not thousands, to death as a result of putting them in the sort of enclosed
environment that guaranteed a high rate of exposure? The US provided the
troops that materially shortened the war ... and morale was evidently not
a problem despite this.)

Anyhow, given McNeill\'s evidence that almost all (if not *all*) diseases
have been crossovers from animals, and that not all such crossovers are
successful, then it seems to me that the Vilani would have encountered this
sort of problem on the thousands of worlds that they had explored and
settled prior to contact with Terra. Also, given the situation we know of
from Traveller sources re the development of human civilisation on Vland,
we can assume that there would have been mutations of bacteria normally
found on or associated with humans (and viruses, of course) that would have
made disease at least reasonably common in Vland even before contact with
other worlds. I have never been able to accept the blithe assumption that
the Vilani would be disease free and would have never developed the germ
theory of disease ... after all, they had first hand evidence of the
possibilities of such diseases from their long historical contacts with
the Droyne on their homeworld ... *and* they had an awful example of the
possibilities of germ warfare from what happened to the native Droyne in
their system when they regained contact (which is in itself doubtful -
the thought that the diseases that killed them off could have been so
specific as to only affect different racial types, *and* that they remained
unmutated for tens of thousands of years, is, frankly, garbage. Diseases
mutate over time, and many once lethal diseases are now nothing more than
a childhood nuisance, if that).

Nope, you can *still* explain away the supposed effects of this plague that
I have never heard about as a crude piece of Vilani propaganda that has
been put forth as "truth" by the RoM and current Imperium for so long that the
*true* story (my version) is not even recognised as "true".

Like I said, between my story and the certainty of Imperial manipulation of
the historical record, there\'s *nothing* that can\'t be adequately explained!

Still, I\'d like to see what the reference too this plague is!

Oh, and the damn listserver is *still* sending multiple copies of both
individual articles in the list *and* of the whole list. Is it possible that
someone could do something about it?

Which is pretty much what happened in the Gulf War.

But as to the "1990s carrier in 1941", this has been a frequent
discussion topic, with numerous variations, in various online groups.

My favorite method of using it (if you get there early enough) is to
simply send out a flight of aircraft with nuke capability, and *remove*
the Japanese attack force just as they are starting to launch the
planes for the attack. And don\'t say *anything* to Japan about it.

Even the Japanese would get rattled when a task force disappears
without a trace.

Then, as soon as you can get in range, you repeat this sort of
"disappeared without a trace" attack on the other thrusts of the war in
the Pacific. *Then* it is suggested in an understated sort of way, that
just *possibly* the Japanese might wish to reconsider their expansion.

Now consider the Traveller equivalent. It doesn\'t take all that many
tech levels for things to be "magic" as far as the folks at the lower
tech level are concerned.

I don\'t think anyone would argue with a modular approach, but it can be taken
too far. After all, say I wanted a jump 4 1000t ship, I need to install 10 of
the 100t designed modules. Does this approach really give any benefit over a
module designed for a 1t ship, which could then have mass/price/volume

Likewise here, say I need 1050MW, I have to install 10 100MW modules and a
50MW. This has got to be more complicated than a table where the
vol/mass/price/vol of 90 days fuel are all listed per Megawatt of power for
each power plant. This way you find your power requirement, multiply all the
values for the chosen type of plant by it, and you have an easy custom
powerplant. I don\'t think the problem here is the rules as much as the way GDW
presents them (HEPlaR is probably the worst).

One major simplification which I would like to see is any subsystem where price
/mass/volume/power requirement is less than, for example 0.01
MCr/tonnes/kl/MW, to have that attribute officially listed as \'negligable\'.
On a lot of my electronics heavy designs I end up adding up columns of devices
with a total volume of a few kl, in a ship with a volume of thousands, and I am
always left thinking _why?_
These small values would add up in a probe, or a fighter, but for a streamlined
FFS optimised for Spacecraft, I think we could dispense with some of these
little details.

To be really useful, we should add some sort of organisation to the
collection, say a further grouping, or an index. The grouping and/or index
should separate things into categories such as different ships systems
and weapons, much like the chapters in FFS. So your laser would be listed
under the categories Weapons, Lasers, TL14 etc. As a further improvement,
adding a search engine to the system would make it invaluable.

Mind you, this would take a LOT of work to set up and maintain. IMHO it
would need to be a group project. Obviously it would make no sense to
start this sort of thing until we know which way ship design is going...

Subject: 2300: Near Stars, "Alpha Crucis"
X-Listprocessor-Version: 6.0c -- ListProcessor by Anastasios Kotsikonas
X-Comment: Traveller Mailing List

Since people are talking about 3D star maps, here\'s some information I\'d
put together that someone else out there might find useful.  I know it\'s
mostly 2300AD, not TRAVELLER, but I\'ve got some more TRAVELLER-related
ideas that I might post later.

I found an electronic file on the \'net that I suspect to be very similar
to the source that GDW used to prepare the Near Star List (NSL).  While
somewhat different than Gliese\'s Preliminary Third Catalog of Nearby
Stars (1991), it does seem useful to identify the stars which GDW left
with only fictional names in the NSL.  Here\'s a short list of some of the
systems which don\'t have the names given clearly on the NSL charts, for
anyone who might be curious:

SOME INTERESTING UPDATES:

.or, reality and the Hubble Space Telescope intrude on our little game.

A typo has been found on the Near Star List.  The F2V star at coordinates
<-45.0, -1.2, -20.5> identified as Alpha Crucis is in fact *Alpha Corvi*.
Alpha Crucis is further away and is a binary system containing a blue-white
subgiant, while Alpha Corvi (Gliese 455.3) is a solo F2V.  It seems likely
that the person who prepared the NSL misread the star\'s constellation
abbreviation as Cru (Crux), not Crv (Corvus), especially considering that
the preceding catalog entry (Gliese 455.2) is Eta Crucis.  "Alpha Crucis"/
Alpha Corvi is just inside the map, placed 49.5 ly from Earth by the NSL.
This typo may have affected the sector naming scheme in TRAVELLER as well.

VB 8 was once thought to have a brown dwarf companion, VB 8 B, and while
VB 8 B is not in the NSL, it did appear in an article on the Clarkesstar
system in _Travellers\' Digest_.  That magazine did a fair amount of
development in the American Arm, including two articles in #11 that opened
the Arm by placing a fictional brown dwarf, ISO 417, at <7.6, -27.2, 4.7>.

However, Hubble Space Telescope has verified the existence of Gliese 229 B,
a *real* brown dwarf.  This is equivalent to the star DM -21 1377 B, whose
system in the 2300AD world contains a Brazilian outpost on the Latin Finger
of the Chinese Arm, at the edge of human space.  Gliese 229 B has a mass of
20 to 50 Jupiters and radiates at not more than 1000 Kelvin.  The Brazilians
have something to study now!

Along similar lines, HST found another new star, Gliese 623 B, one of the
smallest stars known.  This is in the Ellis system, site of a major American
colony.  Fortunately, its\' 2 AU orbit is far enough out that all of the
fictional planets established to be in the system in the game are legal
under the star system rules.  Other vital statistics of the star include an
absolute magnitude of 16.5 or so, and 0.1 solar mass.  Gliese 623 B
shouldn\'t appear much more than twice as bright from Ellis as the Moon is
from Earth.

Pondering the current question of 3-dimensional space in Traveller, I
kept remembering a group of old computer games entitled \'Star Saga\'.
In Star Saga, a player\'s movement in space was visually depicted by a
small lump of colored plastic on a large, colored map.  The map was
broken into what were referred to as \'trisectors\'...usually, one
trisector bordered on another, but sometimes a thicker line seperated
two trisectors.  The line depicted a \'density barrier\' -- a barrier
in space in which the jump drive refused to operate.  (This,
incidentally, fit with the rest of the game mechanics -- that our arm
of the galaxy is divided into density gradients which force one to
use different methods of jump travel in different sections of the arm.
  There were three changes in jump method, so the game was really a
trilogy).

Now, about Traveller.  I\'m not proposing this as something to be
published, but merely as a nifty way for GM\'s to explain why the
Imperium\'s map doesn\'t represent all the worlds it should (ie. those
above and below sectors in spacial terms).

The galaxy is divided into \'density slabs\'.  The Imperium and the
spaces adjacent lie within one large sheet of space that has a
special property that few have been able to pin down.  Jump drives
commonly found in the Imperium can only operate within this slab or
space.  Above and below the Imperial slab, there are other slabs...
stars within or beyond this slab are unreachable using the jump drive
types \'commonly\' found in the Imperium.  (Pilots and astrogators are
always taught this in their respective academies, and most people
accept that ships may never be able to reach those stars or figure
that advances in jump drive technology (j1 to j2 to j3 to j4 to j5 to
j6...so on) will eventually allow them to journey past whatever
barrier lies there.)

Now then...suppose, out on the edge of nowhere, at an Imperial naval
base, some astronomer notices a star five lightyears into the next
density slab go out.  Snuffed like a candle in the dark.  No
supernova, no collapse.  Nothing.  Recognizing this as an unnatural
phenomena, he makes his report and the Imperial navy starts
researching ways to penetrate that slab as though it were the only
project that needed funding.  Eventually, they find a way, but civil
war or <insert calamity here> occurs and the drive and its associated
paperwork is lost.

Adventure seed:  The players journey to <insert planet name here> on
their way to their true destination (so they believe) -- it\'s only
supposed to be a stopover, so they don\'t expect anything to untoward
to happen.  One of them notices, however, that several men and aliens
in dark cloaks is constantly nearby whereever they go on the planet.
If confronted, the darkly attired men will explain that they seek
people familiar with space travel interested in doing some dangerous
(but relatively profitable) work.  If the players agree, they will be
taken to a monastery.  There, a Hierophant will lay out the plan for
the players: using a technology hidden for centuries, they are to
journey into the density slab and discover exactly what is occurring.
 The Brothers are, as they style themselves, \'gaurdians\' and watchers.
  They sent out their only vessel equipped with the jump drive -- and
their only astrogator -- over a year ago.  Lacking the resources to
mount another expedition, they are turning to the players for help.
Par
s for a second drive are available, but the monks require an existing
drive to mount it on -- enter the players and their vessel.  The
players are informed that these expeditions into the slab are rare
and are only performed at fifty year intervals.  The monks will be
unwilling to give any other information, but will send along one of
their number to observe.

Embellish it as you choose...there could be an immense star spanning
civilization inside the slab...or the burnt husk of an empire...or
dozens of star-states warring amongst themselves.  One thing is
pretty clear -- it ain\'t nothing like home.

    'body' => 'OK, now that I know where it\'s from, it\'s *easy* to discount. The info is
from terran sources, and so is suspect, you say, in that it claims the
plague occurred *after* the war was over. Aha, but my premise is that the
Terran *military* were the ones who placed these "lies as truth" along
with their Vilani collaborators ... so we need to keep in mind that the
information on the plague is *not* planted by "Terrans" per se but by
"Imperial" (or "Militarist") Terran "Imperials".

Given that, it still makes no difference to my alternate history. Regardless
of when the plague occurred, it had a minimal effect on the course of the war,
and the real victory was won by Terran productiveness.

As for Vilani medical tech, well, I still believe that it would have been
good enough for the so-called "plague" to have been no worse than the Spanish
\'Flu. You mention the 90% (in some cases, not all) die backs of indigenous
populations in Terran history resulting from them encountering "modern"
civilisation and its many diseases ... but note that the main killer in these
cases was not the disease *per se*, but the social collapse that accompanied
it. Many of those people, probably most, would have survived if simple nursing
techniques were applied - provision of food/water, keeping them warm etc. -
but the fear engendered by something so obviously "supernatural" was the
kicker, and most of the people fled the ill, leaving them to die, nominally
of the diseases, but actually as much from neglect as anything else. (This
is thought to be a possible reasnon why Christianity was so successful in
the Roman Empire - during the plagues of the 3rd or 4th centuries, the
pagans basically fled for their lives, while the Christians basically
remained behind and provided the sort of basic care - "charity" if you will -
that saved many of the ill, who were so impressed by the power of their
belief and their god that they converted in large numbers.)

The Vilani are a different kettle of fish. They *must* have knowledge of
diseases - what I was trying to point out is that, even on Vland, where there
were no organisms closely related to them, there must have been food animals
which carried disease organisms ... and, *inevitably*, close association
with large enough concentrations will lead to some crossover simply as a
result of mutual mutation and genetic drift. Some basic precautions for the
treatment of such outbreaks would be part of the Vilani medical knowledge -
and their conquest of the empire would expose them to microbial and viral
organisms from other planets, the ones with the Minor races, at least, that
would be sufficiently different from their own "normal" microbial/viral
background to cause diseases and spur some basic knowledge of disease
amelioration and control methods. Also, consider their contacts with the
Vargr, also of Terran stock (and Influenza is thought, IIRC, to be related
to Distemper ... or is it Swine \'Flu, and distemper is related to some
other human disease? Really makes no difference, the point is still valid).

Also, there has, by the Nth Interstellar War, been ongoing contacts between
the Vilani and Solomani for several hundred years ... and you can assume that
many human diseases would have swept through Vilani space *already*. And it
is likely that the humans offered medical knowledge and vaccines to the
Vilani to treat these diseases, so they are aware of the problems. Look, the
sort of biowar plague that you are claiming the Plague of Duskir was is not
very likely to exist ... something that affects only Vilani, and is a megadeath
causer. Not given the ongoing contacts they\'ve had with humans ... and, given
the long period of separation between the two races it is just as likely
that the Vilani are carriers of some otherwise *to them* harmless virus or
bacteria that is a nasty surprise to their long lost Terran cousins.

Thus, the Plague was not likely to be a significant factor as a military
weapon, and is more likely to simply be a cachet given to a number of
different diseases that the Vilani had not yet been exposed to prior to the
Terran defeat of their military. Or that\'s what I\'ll claim, anyway, and it
makes perfect sense, and is not overly (or even very) complex!

As for the problems of hiding such a conspiracy. Well, why is it a problem?
Yes, there\'s almost certainly a *lot* of information out there that shows it
to be a lie, but who\'s going to allow it to be published openly? At the time,
no-one. And for the here and now, well, we know the Imperial Government
routinely suppresses information it does not want spreading - look at its
attitude (supposedly) to Psionics, the Domain of Deneb\'s manipulation of the
Imperial Library Database, and even the pursuit of Prof Kuligaan (? You know,
the guy who suggested the Imperium wasn\'t etenal in the pre-Virus period).

Then consider the Imperial attitude to "research" ... how the Solomani
Hypothesis was proved. The guy who did it did no onsite research, he simply
did a database search of *secondary* material! Now, since we know the
Imperium manipulates the database, then the material that would show the
truth probably only exists in hardcopies in University libraries and private
collections in the Solomani sphere (or what was *once* the Solomani sphere).
And a lot of that is probably suppressed or security coded, too. Especially
since the Solomani Party is dominated by ethnic Vilani from the occupation
forces who wish to keep their positions ... SolSec would suppress it as a
matter of course, and even more ruthlessly than the Imperials, in all
likelihood.

Then, there\'s the simple passage of time *and* the fact that the "official"
version of history fits all the facts - because all the facts that don\'t
fit have been suppressed. How many Japs know the "truth" about WW2? And
they\'re pikers compared to a thousand year old Imperium!!!

All in all - I don\'t see it as a problem.

is likely true, even allowing for the minimal *actual* difference between
most Traveller TLs. However, the main problem is that there was only a one
TL difference between the competitors ... the Terrans achieved Jump3 while
the Vilani had only Jump2.

Looking along the same TL lines, Jump3 is TL12 and Jump2 TL 11.

Personal Military Tech: PGMP-12, Gauss Rifle for Terrans; Combat Armor and
ACR for Vilani.

Heavy Military Tech: Fusion Guns, Dampers, Superdense Armor for the Terrans;
Repulsors, Meson Guns, Plasma Guns and Crystaliron for the Vilani.

Computers: Model 6 for Terra; Model 5 for Vilani

Commo: Translators for the Terrans; Personal Datalinks for the Vilani

Medical: Broad Antitoxins, Enhanced Prosthetics for the Terrans; Nerve Refusion
and Artificial Eyes for the Vilani.

Transport: Jump3 for Terrans; Jump2 for Vilani

Energy: Fusion Plants 250l minimum for Terra; 1000 liter minimum for
Vilani.

A qualitative edge, to be sure, but not big enough to account for the sheer
mass of the Vilani versus the Terrans. And, given the usual cost of "cutting
edge" tech, most of the Terran fleet probably still would have been Jump2
in any case. So there *still* needs to be an explanation of how the Vilani
lost ... and Terran outproduction by virtue of a different approach to
manufacturing is as good an answer as any.

 TAPS FOR GDW

 January 2 1996

 Bloomington, Illinois

 It is no secret that GDW has been financially stressed for some time.
 These financial stresses have now reached the point where it is
 impossible to continue to do business.

 As of February 28 1996, GDW will cease operations forever. Our time
 between now and then will be occupied in dividing the tangible assets
 of the corporation among the creditors in as equitable a manner as
 possible and in finding new homes for the creative properties
 currently published by GDW. It is our desire that all of our key game
 lines, both roleplaying and miniatures, find suitable publishers who
 will take to heart the needs of the gamers who have supported these
 lines for so long.

 In the past several months as our financial problems have become more
 widely known, we have been bombarded by offers of help from customers
 -- offers of free layout, typesetting, design, and more. It is this
 sort of consumer support and loyalty which makes gaming a very special
 place to do business, and has made it such a pleasure and priviledge
 to serve you for the last 22-1/2 years. GDW may have failed you, but
 you never failed GDW.

  Frank Chadwick
    -- President

 To which I also add my signature...I have not completely decided
what I will be doing, but I feel that I still have something to
contribute to gaming.

 Wherever I end up, doing business with you all has been a trip...

 Thanks...

But you are overlooking something...

In modern times, what you say is true. Ditto for medieval times. But
during the "Age of Exploration", there are numerous examples of
*exactly* the sort of thing you say can\'t happen. And they happened for
the same reason that such might happen when the Vilani and the humans
made contact, or when the two different races of Droyne met.

If you have two (or more) groups *isolated* from each other, and
introduce a disease into one of them, the disease will kill some, maybe
lots (like your Spanish flu example). And over time, the disease
becomes a "childhood nuisance" (like measles or chicken pox). But that
is *not* solely due to mutations in the disease, in fact it *rarely*
is.

Consider what happens after the disease has become a "childhood
nuisance" in one group if you then allow that group to contact another
group that\'s never been exposed to it before.

When Europeans contacted the various cultures *not* on the
Afro-Eurasian landmass, things like *measles* killed many, many
natives. Whole villages were depopulated.

The trick here is that the people from the "relatively immune" group
act as *carriers*. *They* aren\'t affected by the disease, so they can
keep travelling.

Solomani Prisoners of war, or "diplomats" or whatever, would provide a
vector for infection.

BTW, historically, this hasn\'t *all* been one way. While it is true
that the "larger", "more connected" culture tends to be the one
spreading diseases to the other culture, there is some limited evidence
of things going the other way. Syphilis is suspected of having
originated in the New World and spread to the Old.

I think Steve has identified on of the most serious problems in trying to do
a 3-D traveler with "realistic" local stars a-la 2300 -- the state of
knowledge is moving to quickly right now.  With 2 nearby stars identified as
having planets, and with the Hipparcos data ready to blow away any previous
attempt at serious astrometry, any set of stars you could come up with would
soon be proven invalid.  Not necessarily no fun, just wrong.  Its like
trying to write the definitive game of North American exploration in 1493.

   I knew GDW had made a mistake (the distance between Alpha Crucis
and Terra could in no way result in Alpha Crucis ending up in the
Alpha Crucis Sector), and have on more than one occasion pointed this
out--reference my list of nearby stars in Traveller terms of last year.  In
my research on the stars nearest to Terra, it also became apparent that
Aldebaran isn\'t in the Solomani Rim either (after I had argued for a brief
time that it should be--c\'est la science).  Somebody at GDW figured this
out long before I did, which is why Aldebaran Sector is named
appropriately, but unfortunately no corrections were ever issued on the
information contained in the GDW Solomani alien module.

  It is almost certainly what happened.  Good job on identifying Alpha
Corvi, BTW, while I knew that star wasn\'t Alpha Crucis, I hadn\'t bothered
to take things the extra step and figure out just what that F5V star was.

   For my purposes, Alpha Crucis Sector is called `Alpha Leonis` Sector.
Alpha Leonis is the brightest star that region of space, and the name
(as opposed to Regulus, what it is also known by) is _relatively_ close
to the original.  I would like to officially recommend that all TMLers adopt it
in their campaigns.

I agree.  In fact, had the virus been presented in a more logical manner, I
think
more people would have been in favor of it.  You didn\'t have to go from the
central
computer to people shouting jump coordinates between workstations.  There
are ways
that later ships could prevent themselves from infection problems without such
drastic methods.  Even in modern computers, never mind in future ones.

Well, as far as I know I think positronic brains are probably impossible, but
they have been the mainstay of sci fiction since Asimov "invented" them.  Living
Silicon like circuits have appeared already in lots of sci and semi sci fi
things
including (gasp) Star Trek TNG, so living silicon chips gone bad is a logical
step.

There is only one thing we can be certain of about the future, whatever it will
become, what we think it will become isn\'t it.  Look at the early part of the
century for descriptions of life today.  Mostly off the mark in part because
no one thought about how practical things would be.  They looked spiff, but
there were reasons why they did not become popular.  Thus no flying cars,
no video phones, etc, even though we do have the technology to do these with
ease.

I will partly agree and partly disagree.  We need to know some details about the
computers, but not the technical ones.  Do they have limits?  Are they snetient?
Can the traveling salesman problem be solved in less than an order of N squared.
(HEY THAT IS IMPORTANT!  HONEST!)  Some minor technical tidbits like a Suicide
Circuit, a virus snifer which when triggered causes the computer to shut down
by doing a core melt.

Example: There was a Hard Disk Drive built during the 60\'s that upon pressing
a certain button would cause the heads to clamp down on to the platters and
a fire retardant foam would be sprayed in the disk.  The result was the
complete ruination of ths disk, but it was one way to make sure the computer
never took control of the world. <G>  (I KID YOU NOT)

This may be a little too detailed for what we want, but the idea of such things
such as an emergency shut off button, etc. is general enough to be of use.

6.      Please do _not_ use the STR, DEX and END attributes as "hit points" in
        combat.  MT\'s hits style isn\'t very good, either.  Got any fresh ideas
        on this one?
7.      Please include as many "advanced" character generation rulesets as
        possible with the first edition.
8.      Make lots of money and put this darn game back on top where it belongs!

I\'m sure there\'s more, but these, for me and the players in my group, are the
most important.

I think folks on the board have made some excellent suggestions.  I can imagine
how difficult it must be to lend one\'s ear to all of our nagging voices, but we
appreciate being given the opportunity to make suggestions.

       I do however believe that the mention of a plague is in one of the many
booklets for CT. and does make sense. in fact I believe the plug worked like
this. the viliani living on a planet with an "alien" biology, never had problems
 with bacteria or viruses as none of these agents on vland where compatible with
 terran biology. This also meant the viliani had to work outhow to process food
 just so they could eat it. then along come the Terrans first contact. Boom!
 Viruses, bacteria and fugi that the viliani had not had contact with for
millennia. Having no resistance to these contagens being spread around it is no
wonder whole populations get whiped out.  Mostly from a lack of resistance but
also from a lack of knowledge about terran biology.  Look in the Solomani source
 book (CT) and the valini books (MT) and you should find these references.

For a different take on higher tech -vs- lower tech militaries, check
out Harry Turtledove\'s "World War" series (in progress). A starfaring
race with military tech about equivalent to current US capabilities
invades Earth in 1942. Earth doesn\'t automatically fold up just because
the invader\'s tanks, aircraft, personal weapons, etc. are far superior.
There\'s a scene where German troops fire on the invaders with a WWI-era
railgun. The invaders hit the incoming shell with anti-missiles, but
an artillery shell that weighs more than a ton doesn\'t pay much attention
to being hit by a missile.

It\'s a different view on the "Nimitz in WWII" discussion, and it\'s fairly
entertaining. The first book in "World War: In the Balance", the second
in the series is "World War: Tilting the Balance". There are two more
books to come, over the next couple of years, it seems.

Jump-1   3
Jump-2   9
Jump-3   18

Jump-6   63

The economics of the Imperium is built around jump-1 and jump-2
traders; the politics is built around the slow transmission speed of
the Xboat network.

Now, let us assume we want our jump-one fat trader to be able to
access three systems (again, on the average.)  Unfortunately, the
volume of space accessable by a jump-2 ship is EIGHT TIMES the volume
accessible by a jump-1 ship, leading to the following:

       SYSTEMS ACCESSABLE (on the average)
       Threespace, jump-1 ships access three systems
Jump-1   3
Jump-2   24
Jump-3   81
Jump-4   192
Jump-5   375
Jump-6   648

Whoops.  Assuming 40 systems per "subsector" a jump-2 ship can access
half the systems in a subsector in one jump; an X-boat can reach
nearly five subsectors!

Even if we drop back ten and punt, declaring that on the average, a
jump-1 ship can reach only one other system, we get

       SYSTEMS ACCESSABLE (on the average)
       Threespace, jump-1 ships access one system
Jump-1   1
Jump-2   8
Jump-3   27
Jump-4   64
Jump-5   125
Jump-6   216

But now jump-1 ships cannot be expected to get more than a few parsecs
from their shipyards under their own steam.  Doubling the amount of
cash spent on drives and fuel results in an eightfold increase in
possible destinations.


Now, the last time I started thinking about running a Traveller flavor
campaign in three-D, I came up with the idea of juggling the distance
a "jump-X" drive could go-- back-calculating the distance figures so
that the volumes accessable to each kind of drived matched up with the
expected number of systems in the volume, but at that point my ears
started to bleed.

  There ought to be a way for almost any obstacle to be solved
  non-violently by thought, even if it\'s also possible to do it by
  going after it with all weapons blazing.  Area-specific
  adventures are OK, but if they _are_ published, some guidelines
  on converting them to run in another area would be appreciated.
  Better still would be to publish adventures that aren\'t oriented
  to one specific scenario.

  Above all, the thing that needs to be remembered is _RELIABILITY_.
  If you\'re saying that _Offworld_ is going to be published every
  two months, then by golly, meet that schedule.  Ditto with
  product releases.  Don\'t sacrifice quality to do it (the way T$R
  did) - but don\'t let yourself get into the same pattern that GDW
  did, where any date that was published was an estimate of a
  fantasy, and schedule slippage was the single largest shipment
  coming out of Illinois. I just wonder, sometimes, how many people
  were _lost_ from the Traveller market because of it...

  Enough for now.

  I\'ve been watching the debate over what the future direction of
  Traveller should be, now that GDW has announced that they will
  kiss us goodbye, but I\'ve avoided saying much.  Having seen some
  opinions _and_ some thought-out suggestions, I think it\'s time to
  toss in my two centicreds to the debate.

  First, let me note that I _have_, privately, sent feedback to
  Marc, and I have also had some correspondence with Roger in re:
  Traveller IV or whatever it ends up being called.  I haven\'t
  copied the list on what I felt it was inappropriate to do so.

  I\'ll try to stick to one concept at a time in the remainder of
  this missive; please forgive me if I stray from that ideal.

  In general, I see good features to all three rule sets to date; I
  believe that a good rule system for Traveller IV (T4 henceforth)
  would take the best of the three existing rule sets.

  Character Generation:  There were two IMO serious faults in the
  CT and MT character generation systems.  First, both of them
  offered the opportunity to kill a character during generation.
  Unh-unh.  No way.  No way in hell I\'m gonna let Joe Blow, BABAA9
  bite it before I get to _use_ him (yes, I really rolled him up -
  but his name was Kamehameha Rabinowicz-Singh, and no, he didn\'t
  die during generation). I don\'t recall a character that I or any
  of my players ever rolled where we didn\'t have the "optional
  survival rule" (short term and immediate muster) in force, just
  in case. Second, the lack of provision for multiple careers - if
  you\'re starting a character out at age 18, by the time he puts in
  his 20 in one of the armed services, he\'s only gonna be 38.  Even
  today, that\'s young enough to be able to start a second career,
  even if it can\'t (normally) be a military one. Many NYC police
  officers, for example, do just this, sometimes using their
  "off-duty employment" as a basis for it.  TNE closed both
  problems - but _its_ major problem was that there was no
  equivalent to the extended CT/MT character generation procedure.
  A minor problem was that it didn\'t really allow for "off-duty
  employment" in careers where this is realistically possible
  (almost all civilian careers, including law enforcement).  WHAT
  I\'D LIKE TO SEE IN T4: Extended career generation for all
  careers, or at least guidelines that explain the logic behind the
  implemented system so that GDs (Game Designers; I always felt
  this most appropriate for things from Game Designers\'
  Workshop...) can implement their own in keeping with that
  philosophy; ODE availability where it\'s reasonable; no death
  during generation; ways to improve (within limits) UPP stats.
  Quite honestly, I think the TNE character generation system is a
  good _start_.  It\'s by no means a finished product, though, and I
  could see providing a little more "complex details" for some
  careers - recall my extended post to the TML (not to the XTML,
  though) on Law Enforcement character generation some months back.
  I\'d also like to see equally detailed character generation for
  nonhumans, and for major-polity characters other than the
  heretofore "focus" groups - the RC, the Pocket Empires, and the
  Regency.

  World Generation:  Inadequate in the base system; overly complex
  in both World Builder\'s and World Tamer\'s.  Gotta figure
  something out here; I like the level of detail provided by
  WBH/WTH, but about the only sensible way to use the procedures is
  to write a computer simulation - and I haven\'t, yet.  The short
  UWP probably provides enough information for a referee to come up
  with a "planetality", but there\'s room for expansion.  The WBH
  did this, especially with respect to law level and tech level
  data - but I think that it could have been done for Government,
  also; there are forms of government which are ambiguous as far as
  how to classify them.  For example, would the United Kingdom be a
  charismatic dictatorship or a representative democracy?  Would
  that change if the Sovereign had powers equivalent to the ability
  of the President of the United States to issue "executive orders"
  which have the force of law?  Also, an economic profile (see my
  comments on trade) would be useful; government decisions and
  priorities can _strongly_ influence the economic climate,
  including the desirability to foreigners of doing business there.
  Also, should the UWP reflect what the government _says_ is the
  case, or what is _really_ the case?  For example, the law may say
  that no weapons may be carried (law code 9), but if many people
  carry weapons and nobody seems to do anything about it, then the
  effective law level may be only 4 or 5. Which do you record?

  Task Resolution:  Just recently, someone posted some thoughtful
  comments, including a method wherein the "Huh?" factor can be
  taken into account.  I _like_ this; it adds realism to task
  resolution.  I would prefer a way that "_requires_" role playing,
  but that\'s unrealistic - I can\'t rationally expect a _player_ who
  knows nothing about computer programming, for example, to come up
  with a workable, coherent method of solving a computer-related
  problem - that\'s the whole _point_ of the task system, and it\'s
  my responsibility as GD to take the results, and dilute liberally
  with technobabble to integrate it into the
  adventure/campaign/scenario.  For non-combat tasks, I feel that
  the MT system was useful; modified to allow for uncertainty and
  "Huh?", I think it would do nicely for T4. Combat is supposed to
  be fast moving; I\'d like to see a combat system that is fast

  moving as well.  Realistic accuracy, penetration/damage, and
  armor factors are a must, regardless of the actual numeric values
  used; I\'d recommend a flat "to-hit" number, DMs + accuracy and
  character skill/ attribute, - target agility (within limits - you
  can\'t dodge a beam of light...); and damage based on penetration/
  damage less target armor.  This kind of system _requires_
  realistic assessment of the indicated factors, at least relative
  to each other, otherwise, you potentially end up with the
  ridiculous scene where the martial-arts expert goes up barehanded
  and bare-assed against the Imperial Marine with the battle dress
  and the FGMP15, and wins - that\'s OK for a Bruce Lee movie, but
  not for Traveller.

  Other play rules:  The trade rules I\'ve seen aren\'t satisfactory
  at all.  A good set of trade rules would allow for rarity on
  sourceworld, demand or lack thereof on destination world, and
  cost differentials based not only on tech level but on currency
  exchange differentials.  Not to mention dealing with the
  overhead, which could be different not only between ships, but
  between cargos, either due to inability to load the exact same
  amount each trip, or because of special handling needs.
  Unfortunately, to do what I would consider an adequate trading
  system would almost have to be virtually a whole game in itself.
  Maybe one of these days I\'ll finish working up the extended
  economic profile/system I started working on.

  Technical Architecture:  The FFS concept is good; the execution
  leaves much to be desired.  The numbers don\'t come out right, and
  it\'s quite difficult to follow the procedure, not to mention
  time-consuming.  There\'s also no way equivalent to the CT USP to
  quickly profile a ship as far as basic capabilities go.  The
  highly detailed profile that seems to have become standard is
  nice to have, when it becomes important, but having something
  like a USP would be convenient when you\'re about to enter
  ship-to-ship combat, and want a basic rundown on the capabilities
  of that Schlemiel-class zetzer as compared to your own
  Schlemazl-class tukhuspotcher.  At that level, there\'s only a few
  things you\'ll really need to know - how does its _X_ compare to
  mine, where _X_ is any or all of speed, maneuverability,
  offensive power, defensive power, jump capability, size, ability
  to jam my communications, ability to punch his communications
  through my jamming.  Those, at least, are right off the top of my
  head.  A good starship commander would have that information for
  the stock versions of each class of ship he would likely
  encounter - but my players aren\'t starship commanders; they\'re
  computer geeks, accountants, marketing reps, auto mechanics, and
  so on.  A quick comparison of USPs would provide a reasonable
  "feel" of having that information at your fingertips.  Similar
  systems for planetary vehicles (i.e., for ground combat or just
  normal use on a planet) would be appropriate for the same
  reasons.  Personal weapons probably don\'t need a profile string,
  although for completeness it might be nice.

  Sourcebooks:  I like the way _Vampire_Fleets_ was organized, with
  alternating sections of adventure plot and background info.
  However, the TNE philosophy of keeping the GD as much in the dark
  as the players doesn\'t sit well with me.  I like to know the
  whole story, so that I at least have some idea of what to expect
  if my players decide to go off in some wild unexpected direction.
  I like the level of completeness represented by much of the
  material put out for CT and MT, especially the DGP alien modules.
  Specifically, I like _information_, even if the presentation
  results in "moral" ambiguity.  This, to me, has been a hallmark
  of Traveller, that made its stellar societies _real_, rather than
  just being Americans in funny clothes - there was always enough
  _background_ to see how and why a particular behavior would fit
  into the society that it putatively stems from, rather than just
  being a funny habit grafted onto otherwise ordinary-to-20th-
  century-Terran-American-eyes people.  I like the proposed idea of
  telephone-directory sourcebooks, _provided_ that (a) they\'re not
  _required_ to play, or to understand adventure material published
  elsewhere, and (b) they are coherently organized, chock-full of
  real information, and properly proofread.  Coherent organization
  would also, in my view, allow the sourcebook to be published in
  sections, or even printed one article at a time in _Offworld:_
  _The_Journal_for_the_Dedicated_Traveller_ (benefit of membership
  in TAS).  Marc\'s idea of source material for multiple eras in the
  History of the Universe, including parts of history never before
  seen, is also a drooler for me.

  Using My Model/1:  Yeah, I like this idea.  I\'d like to see
  decent software for all sorts of purposes for decent prices.
  FFS2.  WBH/WTH.  CharGen.  Atlas.  Something like the Traveller
  Navigator seems to me not to be worth the money that was being
  asked for it, especially since almost any computer geek with
  Microsoft Word for Windows and the Microsoft Help Compiler could
  turn out something useful that looked a lot like the product
  portrayals from the ads in a small number of days (per sector).
  Don\'t rule out shareware, either.  I\'d have written a lot of the
  above if I had a decent compiler for a Windows language that
  didn\'t add gratuitous bloat to the code.  I\'d even consider doing
  stuff in DOS, if I thought there was a market for it...

  Published Adventure Material:  My group isn\'t into hakkenslash.

i think I was slightly misunderstood here.  Jump drives would be built by
factories in certain sizes with listed ratings, and jump performances.
(e.g.) a Jump Drive built to push a 1000 ton ship at J-3.  It could be
installed in a larger ship to get J-1 performance, or in a smaller ship to
get higher performance.  (Assuming of courcse you don\'t break the TL jump
barrier (e.g.) TL-14 only allows J-5.  What it gives the benefit in is the
RolePlaying acpect of the game.  My old GM used to let me know that I could
build ships using book 2 at its prices, but to get the better performance of
High Guard, I had to use its prices.  This lead me to believe that Book 2
components are mass produced, but HG was custom built.  So Joe Blow wants to
build a 400 ton ship.  He drops in the standard Avionics package, Standard
Life Support by person, allocates cargo and fuel.  Then its time for J
Drive.  He asks the shipbuilder what they can do, thet contractor
says...Weeeelllll, I have a J-2 drive for a 600 ton Sub-Liner we could
retrofit, it should give you J-3, or I have a J-4 from a 400 Liner that
might do the job.  I could just drop in the rated J-3 unit, but we are out
of stock on those right now, it\'ll take 4-8 weeks to get one in from next
system.  I could custom buildya one.  We do good work, it would be about 3/4
the size, but its gonna cost ya.  So what\'ll it be?

Ok, once again bear with the prior example.  There are two likely occurances
of how power plants are done.  Either they are custom built for each ship,
or there are some drop in types available.  The drop ins are going to be for
smaller ships, they might go as large as 10,000 MW, but will probably be no
larger than 2,000-3,000MW.  Remember none of this applies to MILITARY SHIPS.
Almost every Mil Ship is going to be custom built, or it is going to be
built in mass quantities anyway by yards that only build Mil Ships.  We are
only talking about COMMERCIAL SHIPS.  Most commercial ships don\'t need Giga
WAtt power sources.  So purchasing a 150MW plantand having the next be a
200MW then a 250, then a 500 then a 750, then a 1000, then a 1250, 1500,
2000, 2500, 3000. Would satisfy almost every need.  VTW: this all goes to
pot if PP are custom built every time.  That major advantage of component
builds are Speed of Construction and design.  And one last word.  There has
to be a use for that extra MW.  If nothing else, run the plant at lower
capacity for longer life, or if cost is an issue, run it at 110% to get the
MW you need to fight since that happens so rarely.

Or just put it all into a Avionics package that encompasses certain standard

highly significant event, providing the push that toppled the basically
rotten structure of the First Imperium.  Given my sense of what the
Solamani were capable of, biowar sounds more logical to me than some
covered-up sophisicated manufacturing sites.

  By the way, the article in Traveller\'s Digest about the Plague is _not_
written from the Solomani point of view - it\'s objective GM background
material and so must be assumed to be true.  I\'d very much apperciate it
if someone out there who has issue 24 handy would post the relevant
description.  My memory says it contributed to Terran victory, but I
certainly could be wrong.  It definitly contributed to Vilani collapse.

  As far as disease transfer goes between Vilani and alien animals, well,
you might think totaly alien animals can transfer infections, but I
don\'t.  After all, the Vilani have a whole class of peole who do nothing
but make alien food safe to eat.  Now, if you argued that the bacteria in
the human gut might mutate, well, I\'d buy that.  Still, Traveller canon
says that Vilani med tech lags other races - sounds good to me.

  One more thing.  Purely by chance, I was looking at the Referee\'s
Companion for MegaTraveller yesterday, and in the Vargr section, it
says "the more obvious military victories of the Terran Confederation are
generaly considered to be the main force in bringing down the Vilani
Empire, but inroads by the Vargr surely accounted for much of the
collapse."  The section goes on to outline how the Vargr ran wild,
eventually penetrating far enough to leave Vargr settlements by the
K\'Kree border.  Frankly, this bolsters my point - who needs secret
Solomani factories when you have documented Vargr ones?

Dear Folks -

FINALLY finished Tavonni!! Am now hoping it won\'t get lost in the

INTRODUCTION

"The much-vaunted RCES did not actually develop any new techniques,
they simply refined old ones under the direction of their Hiver
masters."

"Tavonni, for example, was a bootstrap operation long before the
RCES even knew what the term meant".

(excerpt from _A Staple Diet: The Collected RICE Papers_, 1240 edition)

EARLY HISTORY

Tavonni is one size point away from being a T-Prime world - ripe
for colonisation. Why, therefore, has the Imperium ignored the
world for centuries? To understand this, one must first
understand the history of the centuries-old Imperium/Sword World
conflict, and Imperial defensive strategy in the region.

The Buffer Zone

In the years prior to the First Frontier War (589-604), the
Imperium gradually expanded along the mains in a kind of "line
of least resistance" fashion. It took the war to make the
Imperium recognise the danger posed by the Abyss. The Sword
Worlds, although not a united force, were now part of the
Outworld Coalition. Suddenly, the Imperium perceived the Sword
Worlders to be a serious threat to the "soft underbelly" of the
Marches. Imperial strategists began saying that "even Sir
couldn\'t miss that gap" (attributed to Fleet Admiral Frederick
Shaeshpaa, Olav hault-Plankwell\'s chief-of-staff, referring to
the Sword Worlder code of deference)[1]. Plankwell duly
dispatched Imperial forces to take the Abyss worlds and "plug
the gap".

This changed the Imperial strategic direction in the region.
Originally, the only Imperial worlds on the immediate far side
of the Abyss were Arba/Lunion and Rabwar/Lunion. A six-parsec
gap existed between Arba and the next Imperial world,
Vilis/Vilis. The taking of Tavonni/Vilis and Saurus/Vilis
created a buffer zone between the Imperium and the Sword Worlds.
At TL 11, even the best Sword World starships were only jump-2
(even now, only a handful of ships are jump-3). To penetrate
into the Imperium means that any Sword Worlder fleet must jump
into the buffer zone (the Vilis-Saurus-Tavonni-Arba axis),
refuel, and then jump into the "Imperium proper".

With this buffer in place, the Imperium was free to develop a
"defence-in-depth" (similar in many ways to the current Regency
Frontier). The Navy and Scouts built bases on newly annexed
Lanth/Lanth (the Navy for defence, the Scouts for surveillance).
The Navy built supporting bases on D\'Ganzio/Lanth and
Ghandi/Lanth, and strengthened the base at Adabicci/Lunion. The
IISS, again for surveillance, established a base on
Rabwhar/Lunion (at jump-3 from the Sword Worlds, it was just out
of reach). In order to allow for a "scorched-earth" retreat
strategy, the Imperium left the buffer-zone worlds undeveloped
(with the exception of Arba/Lunion).

Border Strategy and the Frontier Wars

Having taken these steps to secure their borders, the Imperium
ignored the border-zone worlds for centuries. They nearly lost
Tavonni in the Third Frontier War (979-986), when Sword World
forces took Saurus and Margesi/Vilis. The Imperial strategists
did not view this as critical, since the only viable
destinations from Saurus are Vilis and Tavonni. Even so, they
deemed Saurus and Margesi critical enough for the Imperium to
retake them in the Fourth Frontier War (1082-1084).

Standard Imperial strategy adopted for the region was to post
scouts in the buffer zone to fore-warn of invading fleets. This
meant that the only permanent presence on Tavonni was a Scout
surveillance team. The IISS stationed three to four Scouts on
Tavonni to operate an array of sensitive detection equipment,
and stationed a scout ship at Tavonni\'s jump-point. If the
ground base detected hostiles, it used a tight-beam link to
transmit the intelligence data to the scout ship, which then
jumped to Lanth. The Imperial forces used the early warning to
retreat and regroup. The deep-support bases continued supplying
the Lanth strong-point, while high-mobility forces jumped behind
the lines to harass the enemy\'s line of supply.

During the Fifth Frontier War, the Imperials used this tactic
quite successfully, if a tad over-zealously. When Lanth heard
that the Gram Fleet was at Tavonni, they dispatched a
counter-fleet to the system. This rapid response was actually
due to (faulty) intelligence data given out by Santanocheev\'s
Office of Naval Information. The ONI had calculated that any
Sword World fleet needed at least three weeks to fully
frontier-refuel. Therefore, if the 193rd Fleet jumped
immediately from Lanth, they would catch the Sword Worlders in
the buffer zone. In fact, the Gram Fleet refuelled in under
three days, and jumped directly for Lanth. The 193rd missed the
Sword Worlders at Tavonni, but returned to Lanth just in time to
surprise the Sword Worlder\'s planetary invasion.[2] On 096-1109,
the newly formed 100th Fleet forced the Gram Fleet off Lanth,
and out of the subsector by 211-1109. Tavonni was liberated
shortly after.[3]

MODERN HISTORY

Modern Tavonni history covers a very short space of time,
encompassing 1111 to 1201. Caradoc LIC, a Ling Standard Products
company, purchased the system in 1117. Menelvagor Ltd,
originally a Sword World company, built the starport. The
background on both companies provided below explains how this
seemingly unlikely fusion came about.

Caradoc LIC

Caradoc began when a retired Fleet Admiral (Count Leto
Khaanraarshuinki) and a retired Army general (Gukushriiken)
created a trading company in the Outrim Void (Egryn subsector,
Trojan Reach). In 1099, the pair teamed up with two ex-scouts
and a merchant. By using their retirement benefits and Leto\'s
family fortune, they created a subsector-wide interface line by
1101. Trading, a lanthanum strike, and the salvage of missing
frontier cruiser Bright Light built Caradoc\'s capital to TCr 1
by 1117. When Leto learned of the Strephon\'s death, he foresaw
trouble in the Outrim Void. Guessing at the probable response of
the ihatei (with knowledge gained from trading), he decided to
abandon their trading bases and retreat to the Marches. While
scouring the sector for a new base, Leto cut a deal with LSP to
become a subsidiary company. This gave Caradoc access to
much-needed contacts within the Marches, and provided a large
capital base to draw upon. When his scouts returned, Leto
decided that Tavonni was the best choice for a base: it provided
land, it was in an under-developed subsector, and it was in a
central location in the Marches.

Menelvagor Ltd

Menelvagor Ltd traded throughout the Marches for nearly ten
years, after being incorporated on Beater/Sword Worlds in 1101.
Growing from a single free trader to a fledgling company, it
received a severe setback when pirates destroyed its flagship
Mithril Wanderer in 1110. The company lost its founder, Beowulf
Heyerdahl, at the same time. Baroness Heidi Maria Heyerdahl took
over the company and steered it through the remainder of the
Fifth Frontier War. Two years later, the shipyards at
Pixie/Regina completed the company\'s new flagship Bonaventure, a
12,810-ton armed merchant cruiser.

The Tavonni Purchase

Leto travelled to Regina personally to petition Archduke Norris
for the Tavonni system. While attending a function, he met
Heidi, and they discussed the purchase. Heidi realised the
potential of the concept and offered to build the starport.
Together, they approached Norris with a detailed proposal. It
included the establishment of a Scout base and xboat link
between Vilis and Lanth, the creation of a starport, and the
provision of a small planetary defence fleet (partly to be
comprised of surplus Imperial Navy craft). Norris approved the
Tavonni Purchase on 261-1117. An extensive system survey began
as Caradoc\'s Darrian Aslan company Ftai evacuated its holdings
in the Outrim Void.

Caradoc immediately constructed a basic D-class starport, while
Menelvagor raised a MCr 2,000 loan from Hortalez et Cie and
began building the "real" starport of Beowulf Down. Caradoc also
recruited refugees from the ihatei invasions as colonists. In a
joint refuel/repair deal with Al Morai, Caradoc ensured that the
refugees were transported to Tavonni at a discount rate. In
turn, Al Morai\'s dead-end route from Regina to Garda-Vilis
turned into a circular route to Lanth, connected via Tavonni.

By the completion of Beowulf Down on 100-1121, Tavonni\'s
population had reached 117,200. A population boost occurred
later that year, when a lanthanum strike in the Peanuts belt
brought miners flocking to the system. A further boost occurred
when the Domain learned of the AI Virus and forced Tavonni to
destroy all its robots. The government had to re-start colonist
recruiting to replace the lost workforce.

The Sword Worlds Land-Grab and the Abandonment

The Imperial Navy supplied a surplus Kokirrak-class dreadnought
to the Tavonni Planetary Navy (TPN) on extended loan. Together
with the Bright Light and Bonaventure, the Khtai provided the
core of the planetary fleet. The TPN increased in size by
loaning and purchasing numerous smaller ships. The ground forces
grew from Caradoc\'s original Aslan company through to regiment
size by 1130.

In 1130, the Navy reclaimed most of the ships loaned to the TPN
(including the Khtai). They also nationalised many of the
military ships owned by the TPN. The Navy re-directed all these
vessels to assist the Quarantine. This almost proved the undoing
of Tavonni when the Sword Worlds attempted their land-grab in
1132. The TPN desperately pressed into service every ship it
could find, even using private vessels as couriers where
necessary. The Tavonni forces fought a rear-guard and somewhat
guerilla-like campaign against the invaders. The Sword Worlders
managed to gain a foothold on the surface, but sustained heavy
casualties as the Ashsiimkir-Ftai, now an Imperial-Aslan
planetary regiment equipped to TL 15 standards, inflicted losses
far greater than their numbers would suggest. The Sword World
ground forces could not crack the four tank companies of the
regiment, having to rely on ortillery that was then vulnerable
both to the tanks and to some well-placed deep-site meson guns.
When elements of the 18th Fleet finally relieved Tavonni, they
drove the Sword Worlders out of the system.

After this, the RQS returned a number of ships to the TPN,
including the Khtai, Bright Light, and Bonaventure. The Tavonni
defence forces had their revenge, accompanying the regular
Regency forces when they annexed the Sword Worlds, supported by
the 151st Fleet from Sacnoth/Sword Worlds. Baroness Heidi
personally claimed her homeworld of Tizon in the name of the
Regency.

The Abandonment (1133) was something of a lifesaver for Tavonni.
Deprived of its robotic workforce three years earlier, and
having to rebuild infrastructure destroyed by the Sword World
invasion, the planet needed more people. With a history of
recruiting refugees for resettlement, the Tavonni government had
an edge over other Regency worlds that opened for colonists.
Tavonni was almost able to pick and choose whomever it wanted to
bring, welcoming them into its society while cleverly avoiding
the "Refugee World" tag (some Regency citizens view this label
with distaste). The young Tavonni society thus succeeded in
incorporating the refugees, much as it had the original (and
on-going) colonists for 15 years. However, the citizens of
Tavonni - normally friendly and accepting - voted recently
against allowing Zhodani refugees to settle in the system.
Observers believe that this result derives from the antipathy
shown to all members of the former Outworld Coalition by the
families of Count Leto and Baroness Heidi.

SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

Inward Clearance

Tavonni considers itself to be on the frontier. Even the
forcible acquisition of the Sword Worlds has not wiped out the
memory of their attempted land-grab. This perception shapes
Tavonni\'s attitude towards defence and inward clearance. Most
outsiders often consider Tavonni\'s defence forces to be overly
large. However, this allows initial inward clearance to be
cursory and almost automatic; always remember; the Navy awaits
insystem. A patrolling naval vessel makes a cursory scan of
incoming traffic and normally clears it through to Tavonni High.
It may give special clearance if a vessel has another
destination (for example, another starport or base insystem).
Generally, this must be pre-arranged.

Tavonni System Control (TSC) is based at Tavonni High, and
monitors all in-system traffic. TSC controls the movement of
ships to and from Tavonni High to all downports, plus any ships
with special clearance that bypass the highport. It also has the
authority to declare a civil or military emergency. The
difference is that a civil emergency causes rescue ships to race
to the scene, while a military emergency causes warships to race
to intercept. Either way, TSC vectors civil and military traffic
throughout the system. All military traffic remains away from
the civil lanes, unless they enable their transponders.

All incoming ships, unless given special clearance, must dock at
the Tavonni High orbital port. Classed as "basic" in size, it
houses up to 500 passengers and 500 work crew. Refined fuel,
spare parts, armament stocks and annual maintenance are all
available, plus local foodstuffs and luxuries from across the
sector. Customs and immigration can clear planet-bound
passengers either in orbit or on the surface. In-bound cargo has
a basic inspection performed on it to ensure that its bill of
lading is accurate. Starport Authority (SPA) customs officers
sometimes inspect cargoes for contraband, but this occurs less
frequently for regular goods than for speculative cargo. SPA
personnel synchronise customs procedures with scheduled shuttle
flights, allowing passengers and cargo to proceed to the planet
with little or no waiting.

If a ship wants to land at Beowulf Down, customs officers must
first inspect it at Tavonni High. Final customs clearance may be
handled either at Tavonni High or at Beowulf Down.  TSC must
then give landing clearance before the ship commences re-entry.
Note that ships with special clearance may undergo inspection,
customs and immigration at their destination downport.

The Mainworld

Seen from orbit, Tavonni appears untouched by civilisation. A
deliberately low-key approach to development has left much of
the planet undeveloped, making it look like a green jewel, lush
with vegetation. While shuttling to the main starport on
Bj=F6rn=F6ya Island, it is difficult to imagine that advanced
sophonts live here at all. It is only when nearing The Plateau
that artificial features begin to emerge from the jungle.

Beowulf Down, the main starport, has excellent facilities for
both private and commercial travellers. Aircraft and small craft
are available for charter. Lone Scout Enterprises, an Imperial
company originally created by ex-Scout commander Mikheil B.
Powell, provides spaceship construction and starship repair. A
full Scout base is attached to Beowulf Down, and is open for
inspection once per month. trendi (Tavonni Research, Engineering
and Design Inc), a subsidiary of Menelvagor, markets new
vehicles and equipment.

The main tertiary industry is hosting conventions and meetings
for members of widespread Regency companies. The consequence of
catering for these well-to-do travellers means that Tavonni\'s
prices are not for the faint-hearted. Accomodation within the
starport perimeter, for example, is at the Starport Hotel
(4-star). The capital, Tamoachan City, is located moments away
from the starport via monorail. Accomodation here ranges from
the Hotel-at-the-Edge-of-the-World (5-star) through to the TAS
Hostel (4-diamond). The off-worlder notices immediately that,
having begun with only pre-fab buildings, Tavonni\'s population
now prefers luxurious dwellings. Due to the cultural diversity,
a number of restaurants provide off-world cuisine. In fact, most
of the cuisines of three sectors, five species and four major
races can be sampled in the capital alone.=20

Tavonni Safari Park (TASP), the next island west of Bj=F6rn=F6ya, is
for exclusive use by safaris. These include both camera shoots
and big-game hunting expeditions. Visitors can see much of the
more exotic of Tavonni\'s wildlife inhabiting the island. The
Tavonni Beach Resort is the only permanent construction on TASP.

The primary Aslan settlements are located on the eastern
continent, mainly for historical reasons. Caradoc\'s base is
located here, operating out of the original starport (now
C-class). It was on this continent that Count Leto first granted
land to members of the Ftai company. One other spaceport in
known to exist on the planet, but its location is classified -
as are the locations of Tavonni\'s deep-site meson guns. At least
four of these are believed to exist - possibly more.

Infrastructure

Civilisation on Tavonni is widespread, literally! Being a young
settlement, Tavonni\'s infrastructure is less than 70 years old,
and averages out at TL 13 (some at TL 15). This planetary
infrastructure contributes to the settlement pattern on Tavonni.

The only large population centre is Tamoachan City (located
close to Beowulf Down), with most of the population living in
medium sized communities, separated from their nearest
neighbours by up to 600 km or more. Most of these mid-sized
communities support smaller communities, based on primary
industry. This settlement pattern means that there are few
long-distance ground transport links. Most passenger
transportation is via grav vehicles, either air/raft taxi for
short distances, or GCoach for longer distances (for example,
via the Vargr-owned long-haul bus company, "G-Hound"). These
long-distance services stress high speed. Rental vehicles are
also available, ranging from \'Hatchback\' style through to Grav
RV. Bulk cargo trade is via either a few ocean-going merchant
ships, or small craft/starships.

>From early on, the government recognised the need for a good
communication net to limit the danger of dropping out of
contact. Without it, help was almost impossible to call for, and
rescuers would spend a considerable time deploying. Tavonni
established an excellent and affordable communications network.
All vehicles must be fitted with emergency beacons. Rental of a
communications service is available at short notice for Cr1 per
day plus Cr0.3 per 10 minutes on-line, with Hand Computer access
at Cr3 per day (long term rentals are lower than these prices).
The Government also created a rapid deployment emergency service
facility. In the early days, the easiest way to provide these
emergency services was to form them from the existing military
medical and police force. Today, they still retain a
paramilitary flavour, being staffed predominantly from
ex-military personnel. For this reason they find it very easy to
escalate problems to full military support in an emergency (the
military are obliged to lend a hand in civil emergencies). They
also have good access to funding, heavy equipment, and the
Count\'s ear on major issues.

SOCIETY

First Impressions

The streets of Tavonni are very cosmopolitan. Droyne (a few) rub
shoulders (or shoulder to hip) with Aslan (a large portion of
the population). Many businesses have been started with
multi-racial, and multi-species partners. Most such businesses
find the diversity an encouragement for all their client races.
Travellers find the population open and friendly. Since most
people are only first- or second-generation settlers (sometimes
third), they welcome people from across the Regency.

The Military

Since the very start of development on Tavonni, there has always
had a strong military presence in the system. Starting by
settling the Ftai company, Tavonni has constantly reviewed and
upgraded its defences. The Sword World border was always on the
mind of Count Leto, and he was the first to recommend annexation
of the Sword Worlds when they began their land grab.

The need for the military has never been questioned - especially
in light of the fact that they are citizens with voting rights.
The Tavonni Planetary Navy and the Ashsiimkir-Ftai regiment
cemented this need in the hearts of the populace, with their
heroic defence of the system against the invading Sword World
fleets.

GOVERNMENT

Democratic government has always been a key part of Tavonni\'s
development. Count Leto shrewdly decided that his planet needed
to be "democratic" in order to attain the "Rich" trade
classification. Accordingly, he formed a Constitutional
Committee to create the Tavonni Constitution and system of
government. The Committee decided that "the people of the planet
of Tavonni will be governed by a representative democracy,
elected from either an independent platform or a party system.
This elected legislative body will be known as the Government of
Tavonni (hereinafter referred to as the Government)" [excerpt
from the Tavonni Constitution].

The population of a locality elects 10 local councillors. In
turn, each local council elects one of its members to be their
representative on the regional council. Each regional council
elects two of its members for the planetary government: one for
the House of Legislation, and one for the House of Review (this
system was an attempt at preventing a two-party political system
from forming). Each level of government can pass legislation
that will take effect in its own area: local councils can pass
Local Regulations; regional councils can pass Regional
Ordinances; and the Planetary Government can pass Bills that
become Planetary Statutes, with the Count having the power of
veto. If lower laws conflict with higher laws, the lower laws
are deemed suspended. The Tavonni Police Force enforces all
three types of law.

Planetary Statutes can also be created by plebescite (a vote of
the entire population). All "matters of public importance" are
decided on by plebescite. In most matters of public importance,
the people tend to vote the same way. In 70 years, the closest
result of a plebescite has been 60:40 (the Zhodani settlement
vote). Every citizen of Tavonni over 18 years of age is be
eligible (but not required) to cast one vote in any election or
plebiscite that occurs in their locality, and is eligible to
submit a petition for a general plebiscite. The Count is NOT
allowed to cast a vote in a plebiscite, unless the matter
concerns the Count\'s Household, the County Estate, or the Planet
of Tavonni as a whole. The Count IS allowed to vote in elections
for his locality.

Note that non-compulsory voting often allows the Count to
influence the vote: he grants leave to any member of the
military who wants to vote. The military personnel, generally
favourable to the Count anyway, have a course of voting
suggested to them via a "How To Vote" card and an educational
campaign.

LANDHOLDINGS

Originally, the estate of the Count of Tavonni consisted of the
entire system of Tavonni. This expanse of territory has dwindled
somewhat, due to the constitutional laws agreed to by the Count.

Crown Land is land directly owned by the Count\'s Household. This
is also known collectively as the County Estate. Private
citizens or companies may purchase freehold real estate from the
County Estate. This is then considered to be "private land". The
Government of Tavonni is granted land for public use ("public
land") by the County Estate. Public land also includes other
areas of Crown Land specifically set aside by the Count. The
Government may resume private land, but only by Statute.

Resources beneath the land are NOT the possession of the owner;
these are possessed by the lessee of the mineral rights for the
area. If there is no stated lessee, then the implied ownership
rests with the Count of Tavonni.

        When Traveller does come back, you better hope it does so with a
state-of-the-art 1990\'s era system, or you\'ll be mourning it\'s death again

remain. TNE may have had flaws, but at least it looked and played like
TODAY\'S RPG\'s.
<<<<<

I have to disagree.  "TODAY\'s RPG\'s" include Battletech/Mechwarrior, which
uses a resolution system essentially equivalent to CT.  As I recall, it
has had more than a modicum of success.  If you are talking about
character generation, I think CT needs a little fixing (no survival roll,
give advanced generation to non-military types, etc.), but I still think
it makes a good quick character.  It is certainly superior to White Wolf\'s
"min-max or die" system, and to Shadowrun\'s template based character gen.
Both of these are modern RPG systems, and both have been quite successful.
In terms of look, I agree that CT\'s zen-like simplicity would not sell to
the style-over-substance crowd which has taken over gaming in recent years.
But that says nothing to the debate over TNE vs. CT/MT rules systems.

While CT may be somewhat outdated, MT, with its armor penetration and task
resolution systems, is not.  MT, IMO, was like a good rock band with a
bad manager.  It died because of bad PR and poor production values, not
because it is a "1970\'s" system.

<<<<<

This was followed by a very nice analysis of the problem in terms of
accessible jump destinations.  Stephan, I agree with you that 3D space
would have some heavy effects on background.  That is the only reason why
I am not 100% behind the concept.  Still, I think with a little work
there might be ways to get around the economic and political problems.
Here are some suggestions off the top of my head (dangerous terrain, let
me warn you, especially this late):

1) Allow high-jump merchants to be more common and do better business. I
realize this changes some old ideas in Traveller, but not too radically.
The jump-range of merchants is still going to be limited by drive cost.

2) Make it more common for jump-1 ships to carry fuel for extra jumps so
that they can reach systems 2 or 3 parsecs away.  Compensate them
economically.

3) Recalculate the distance that a ship with Jump-x can go.  Yes, I
realize this algebraic exhertion might cause some bleeding of the ears,
but I think one of our fellow Travellers (say the radio astronomer or the
particle physicist from CERN? :-) could figure it out.

4) Recalculate payment for cargo carrying.  After all, in a free-market
economy, if conditions change, prices change.  Thus, a ship with jump-1
would be payed a low flat fee to run a standard group of systems (which is
what fat traders are supposed to do anyway), while higher jump ships would
get proportionally adjusted pay. (Any economics majors out there?)

5) The speed of transmission of messages would not be affected that much,
would it?  The distance from Capital to Regina is still going to be the
same.  Some time might be saved because more available routes makes for
more efficient travel, but I don\'t think there would be a radical difference.


I realize none of this is simple as pie, and I realize that it
will screw with canon, but it might be worth the effort.  Because we are
old hands at Traveller, we\'ve grown accustomed to 2D space, but people
first approaching the game might be turned off by such a blatantly
unrealistic concept.

Yours ambivalently,
Charles.

I was recently contacted by an organization that is currently negotiating
with GDW about acquiring the rights to _2300AD_ (also known in its first
incarnation as _Traveller 2300_). Because negotiations are in at a delicate
preliminary stage, the above organization wishes to remain nameless.
However, they are very interested in getting as much feedback as possible
from those who own any 2300AD materials.

So here\'s your chance to sound off about 2300AD: likes, dislikes, what you\'d
change, what you\'d keep, you\'d like to see, what new products, design
philosophy (e.g., more detail vs less detail, etc), why you play it/don\'t
play it, good/bad experiences with the game, you name it! Also include your
primary interest in the game: as player, gamemaster, collector (or any
combination of the above). All responses will be forwarded to the interested
organization.

I would prefer if you posted any response(s) to the list in order to
interest anyone who may have missed the original message. In any case, I\'ll
be looking forward to hearing from everyone soon.

I went ahead and spent some time developing a small section of space from
the Gliese maps, and found that on the average, most stars were over 2
parsecs away, and you\'d be lucky to get a cluster of more than about
5 systems within 2 parsecs.

There were, however, some noticable runs if you got into the right system
and pushed the limits up to 2.5 parsecs. Ships that are capable of Jump 3
have very few places they can\'t get to, and a Jump 6 ship can go pretty
much anywhere it pleases.

If you have WWW access, you can look at the info:

   http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/3d/cluster.html
   http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/3d/inrange.html

These are both scripts that run on our heavily loaded server, so don\'t
be surprised it response is slow. I generally start from star number 587,
which is the "home star" for my game.

How many people living in 1950 (TL6) would have thought that man could walk
on the moon?  By 1970 (TL7) it had happened.  A single technology level
difference allowed things to happen that few would have believed possible.

Phillip McGregor (in Digest 548) identifies "The absolutely, completely,
*inexcusibly* unworkable Technology Level system" as one of the things that
he feels should be revamped in the new release of the Traveller mechanics.

Since differences in technology must be quantifiable to be integrated into
the mechanics, all that remains is a matter of resolution.  While some
(many, even) may have a problem with the generic extended hexadecimal range
supported in all Traveller releases so far, how many would like to see
*hundreds* of levels of resolution for the specific field of "Personal
Combat Weaponry"?  What about "Propulsion Devices"?  What about
"Communications"?

When a game abstracts such a concept as technology, the designers must
compromise resolution with playability.  "Hard-wired" support for a generic
20-30 levels of resolution, and encouragement to use the "official"
technology level as a guide (and to flesh out specific technologies as and
when required) is fine by me.  I don\'t want to deal with high levels of
resolution (such as FF&S offers) for every aspect of the game - just the
one\'s I\'m particularly keen on.

This is why a modular approach is what I\'d like to see worked into the game
- it has the flexibility to offer different levels of resolution in
different areas, according to the desires of the participants.

Just out of curiosity, what resource identifies the amount of *time*
required to manufacture a starship?  FF&S?  I must have missed it.

As for how long it takes to make a starship - the amount of time that it
takes to roll off the production line may pale into significance when
compared to the time it will take to run a full spectrum of
"space-worthiness" tests.  It could take a bunch of technicians and a
skeleton ship\'s crew months to clear a subsidised liner, the fact that it
was thrown together in a few days/weeks has little to do with it (actually,
now that I think of it, the faster that craft are assembled, the more
likely that errors were made, and the longer it would take to clear - this
sort of balances the whole thing out).

Personally, I actually *like* the idea of starships (especially the larger
ones) taking a long, long time to build.  Let\'s talk 5 or so years for
anything in the vicinity of 100,000 tons, for illustration purposes.  If
big ships take a long time to build, it give lots of opportunity to
infiltrate the assembly team with agents, sabotage the construction
facility, target the site with a special operations group - heaps of
possibilities!  If they\'re whipping them out at the rate of one a day, who
really cares?

(Out of curiosity, any trekkers out there know the displacement and
construction time of the Enterprise-D?)

        Or we could try to influence the way ship design is going, by making
all this stuff available for it, and try to convince Marc Miller, et. al.,
that we want to keep it. For that matter, given the precedent, if a new
system DOES come out, there\'s likely to be a number of people who prefer to
stick with FF&S ... For myself, any new system is going to have to be at
LEAST as detailed as FF&S to satisfy me.

the space a given Jump drive could reach, you also cubed the density
of systems.

By assuming that subsectors still had 40 systems/subsector, yet
mapping that to 3-space, you in effect took the number of hexes in a
subsector and set that same number in a three dimensional space.

 Now, instead of a subsector having a 2-space area of 80 (8x10
parsecs) hexes, the same subsector set into 3-space is the cube root
of 80 per side, or a bit over 4.3 parsecs on a side.  If you want to
maintain the same \'form factor\' of the Traveler maps, a 4x5 hex map,
4 hexes deep holds the same number of hexes as a flat 8x10 one.

Three things could be done...

One, maintain the same number of systems
in that newly reduced subsector. This gives rise to Jump-1 =3, Jump 2
=27, etc progression you noted.

Two, increase the number of hexes (to say 8 x 10 x 8) holding the
same number of systems, which will drastically reduce the density,
but maintain the Jump-X = Y systems formula. Trying to maintain that
formula reduces the three space back to the same 8x10 2-d map we all
know, simplifying the mapping requirements considerably.

Three, and most untenable of the three, except in the case of
completely non-canon universes, reduce the number of systems in the
subsector. As I said, this is the most untenable of the three: "What
do you MEAN, Glisten doesn\'t exist anymore!!!"

Unfortunately for all the third-dimensioners out there, there isn\'t,
to my mind, any easy way of converting Trav to 3-d space maps at this
time without throwing out everything that\'s come before, AND creating
a horrific navigation hassle. 2-d maps can be navigated very simply,
3-d just can\'t, particularly at a pencil/paper level.

Requiring a computer to run a trav game would be daring, and in
keeping with an advanced SF RPG, but it would also doom Traveller.
I\'m not going to drag my computer out to the dining room table
whenever we want to play; The office, where the computer normally
resides, doesn\'t have the room, and unless you\'re going to buy it
for me, I\'m not getting a laptop anytime soon...something about
mortgage and utility payments getting in the way ;-) That eliminates
going anywhere by my place to play.

Three-D worked in 2300AD because it was very limited in size, and
all the routes were laid out, AND it had an entirely different style
of FTL drive.

        Well, my proof that TNE sold better than MT is just the opposite --
I could almost _never_ find anything for MT. None of the game stores local
to San Bernardino carried it. What little I found, I found while travelling
(no pun intended), and even then it was stuff that had just sat there and
wound up marked down. TNE, on the other hand, I\'ve had little or no trouble
finding.

 I would actually agree with this. I\'ve been playing around with the MT system
lately, and with the exception of the vehicle design system ( which I\'m still
struggling to understand) it is pretty OK. There\'s no question that what hurt
MT was the very poor editing which resulted in all that errata. I also
think, frankly, that the $30 price tag back in 1987 didn\'t help either. My
comments were directed at those who pine for CLASSIC Traveller. However,
there are still a few holdouts from CT even in MegaTraveller that I\'d like
to see gone in the
new edition: NO survival rolls of ANY kind, and characters having more skills.
Other than that, I could be happy with an MT-style system; but call it
something else!

being hunted down and disease, the latter mainly while in what he called
"concentration camps". Well, so what? The people in question were even more
primitive than the mainland aboriginies, and, IIRC, it was at one stage (and
may still be, I don\'t know offhand) regarded that they were wiped out on the
mainland *by* said mainland aboriginies.

They were a *stone age* people. We know that the Vilani were "backward"
*compared to the Terrans* in their medical technology. Nowhere does it say
that they were the equivalent of TL0 in medical technology! In any case,
AFAIR, the last aborigines in question died out as much because of neglect
*and the destruction of their society* as anything else ... in other words,
it was the *social* impact of the disease and hunting down that did them
in as much as anything else.

Look at the native populations in Mexico as an example of what happens when
your society is destroyed by forces that you do not understand ... you see
the victor\'s society as being superior to your own, and adopt it as yours.
Hence, the adoption of catholicism by said natives and the effective
destruction of almost all traces of the "old" society within a generation
or so. The "wisdom" of the elders is lost, and respect for traditional ways
are lost, the younger generation tend to have a poor self-image, and this
leads to destructive behaviour. Sure, disease may trigger this, but the
real and ongoing killer is, as I pointed out, the lack of care for others
and for oneself that comes with the social impacts of contact between an
advanced culture and a less advanced one. However, you would be wise not to
extend this sort of assumption to the situation of the Vilani and the Terrans.
For a start, there is a maximum of one TL difference between them ... sort
of like the difference between (say) between the 1970\'s (TL8) and the 1990\'s
(TL/9). Significant? Sure! But hardly enough to allow a massive victory if
one side has mass and the other has only a marginal betterment in tech.

Thus, since the Vilani were *not* far behind in tech compared to the Terrans,
there would have been no problem as far as this is concerned ... especially
as, as I have already pointed out, they had, by then, been in contact (and
conflict) with the Terrans since 2096 AD ... some **187** YEARS by the
beginning of said Nth Interstellar War. Surely you would not expect us to
believe that the Vilani were completely unaffected by any Terran originated
diseases during the 187 years, that they learnt nothing from Terran medical
technology as a result, that there were no Terran "mercy missions" to Vilani
planets during that period, when not fighting, in the good old tradition of
the Red Cross/Red Crescent? Come on, guys, by the time of the Nth Interstellar
war the Vilani just weren\'t the sitting ducks to "ordinary" Terran diseases
that some of you seem to think. As for the Plague of Duskir being a biowar
effort, Vilani propaganda pure and simple (the Terrans are pure and the
Vilani are simple) ... it was simply the result of partial societal collapse,
probably disruption of food supplies to isolated and non-self sufficient
colonies, destruction of hygiene facilities etc. that led perfectly ordinary
and normally under control diseases such as Cholera, Typhoid, Dysentery and
the like loose. Nasty, and only possible because of the aftermath of the war
and the fighting.

As for the Gulf War, tech did not win that. What won it was *training* - the
allies had it, and the Iraqis didn\'t. Tech gave the allies an edge, but it
was training that was the killer. The Iraqi soldiers were little better than
partly trained rabble compared to the western and allied forces ... good
enough to stand off Pasdaran (Iranian) "human wave" attacks, but nowhere
*near* good enough to beat the allies. I would say that an equivalent force
of 1970\'s allied troops would have been able to trash the Iraqis probably
just as quickly if they were trained to equivalent standards.

As for quantitative edges beating qualitative edges. I am not aware of any
conflict in modern times that can be said to be a "total war" *and* where
the side with the qualitative edge won against the side with the quantitative
edge.

Take WW2 as an especially good example - the Germans had better plane designs,
they had better tank designs, they had better sub designs ... they even had
better smallarms designs. (Me-262, Me-163, Ar-234 etc for the planes, jets
and rocket powered jobbies; Panthers, King Tigers for the Tanks; Type XXIII
? and Electro-Atlantic U-Boats; MP-43 ... the design of which the soviets
copied as the AK-47, and the MG-42, which the US copied as the M-60) What
they didn\'t have were the *numbers* of those machines of death and destruction
that the west had (or even the western supplied soviets) ... they were always
short of fuel, ammo, and even rifles (I recall that the Supply arm of the
Wehrmacht complained that the loss rate of *rifles* in 43-44 exceeded the
replacement rate to the extent that even existing stockpiles of captured
foreign weapons weren\'t enough to take up the slack ... or soon wouldn\'t
be). The Germans simply couldn\'t compete on a mass basis *at any level*,
they were outproduced and buried by allied industry in the end.

The situation in the Nth Interstellar war must have been very similar. The
Vilani suddenly realised what a threat the Terrans had become, and threw
everything that they had into the fight ... eventually even weakening the
Vargr border to the extent that the said Vargr incursions someone mentioned
took place. But even that wasn\'t enough. The Terrans were able to bury them
with their superior level of production. The Vilani never had a chance,
poor suckers.

(Oh, and note, I\'ve explained quite handily how the Vargr came to be where
they were on the k\'Kree border or wherever.)

And, as I pointed out, the Rule of Man (under the treasonous militarists who
overthrew Terran democratic government with Vilani help and installed the
traitor Estigarribia as Emperor), had from AD 2299 to AD 2742 (some 4 1/2
centuries) to suppress information and falsify the historical and public
record. Any source material that was left probably had a hard time surviving
the ensuing "Long Night" (almost 18 centuries) ... and we know that the
Third Imperium has a long history of suppressing and distorting information.

Ergo, the Terrans *did* beat the Vilani by outproducing them with factory
tech that they had their traitorous Terran militarist allies suppress, and,
so, the Terran *Government* actually *lost* the Nth Interstellar war!

specifically in MTrav (pg. 61 "Referee\'s Manual") as well as in Classic Trav.

Referee\'s Manual: "Ships of less than 60000 kiloliters (about 4400 displacement
tons) can be completed within 36 months by any competent shipyard. Ships over
60000 kiloliters require from 24-36 moths to complete, based on conditions,
volume of orders, and the degree of haste desired by the ordering government."

"Additional identical ships can be completed in 80% of the original time and
for 80% of the original construction cost."

Book #2: Starships (CTrav): See page 22, a 100 ton hull takes 9 months to
build, 200 tons 11 months, thru to 1000 tons at 27 months.

Book #5: High Guard (CTrav): See page 20, Ships of 5000 tons or less need
no more than 36 months and ships of 5000 tons plus require 24-60 months.

As for how realistic these times are, consider, as I said, the 747. Weighs
around 170 tons. Production time, when geared up? Around a couple or more a
*day*. Do they test each plane off the production line to destruction
before they hand it over to the customer? No. I don\'t know how much testing
it goes through before deliver, a week? Sure, you *might* argue that
Starships are somehow more complex than a 747 ... and you may be right, at
that. However, the problem here is that the quality control and testing
regimes of the shipyards producing them are *also* much more complex. So,
at worst, they have kept pace and the damn thing requires a week or two of
testing, may a couple of Jumps ... certainly no more than a month or so.

Like I said, look at the efforts of the US and allies with Liberty & Victiry
Ships in WW2 ... and don\'t forget that they had similar amazing production
time reductions for warships from DEs through to Aircraft carriers.

Sure, small production runs (like for large military ships) may require
some extra time, but for ships of the 1000 tons or so that most PCs are
going to have some chance of owning, they\'ll be of generic designs and
should take no more than a a week or so to produce. Forex, we *know* that
there are some 30000 Scout/Couriers in service throughout the Imperium, and
1000 in the Spinward marches ... and yet the damn things take 9 months to
build. Nope, sorry, maybe with 1930\'s production techniques, but not with
those of the 57th century.

There is a perfectly good explanation as to how JDrive missiles (2 tons
displacement) can be made to work. The *real* limiting factor was the
minimum size of the Fusion power plants (esp see MTrav, where they\'re
humongous!) - but there\'s no *need* for the Fusion power plants to be on
board the vessel with the JDrive! We know (from a variety of sources, inc.
the "Starship Operator\'s Manual") that the majority of the space allocated
for the JDrive is *not* for the actual drive, but for the extremely high
capacity output fusion reactors to provide the power needed in less than
the handful of hours that the zuchai crystal/energy capacitors can hold
the energy before decaying. The solution? Easy! Use the mother ship\'s JDrive
generators and dump the power into capacitors (see the Black Globe rules
in CTrav and MTrav, as well as in FF&S) on the missile and then launch it.
The actual *active* portion of the missile is probably less than 10% of the
actual generator volume ... even the mother ship\'s computers can be used
to dump in a course tape.

So. There we have it, a reasonable explanation for a Jump Courier Missile!

idea in my head...

The party is approached very obliquely by a representative of Tukera
Security, the Vermene, to investigate labor unrest on a major ship of
the line, a Tukera Majesta-class freighter, the `Catherine the Great\'.

This adventure takes place before the Solomani Rim War (990- 1002) but
long after the Great Merchant Strike of 904. Put it about 985. This
could be part of the events and provocation\'s leading up to the
Solomani Rim War.

Introduction

Tukera Security is concerned about the possibility of another general
strike aboard the megamerchant class ships. Many of the gains achieved
by the crews in the Great Strike have eroded over time, particularly
in the face of the many planetary depressions and recessions
experienced in the wake of the Strike.

Rumors of another Strike have surfaced. Vermene has little concrete
evidence of any plot, simply a single report from an agent who has
since vanished, concerning a possible labor action possibly involving
Solomani influence, and a hunch by Mildur Troygvan, head of Vermene.
Troygvan\'s hunches have played out before, so Sildas Tukera heeds his
security chief on these matters.

The Great Strike cost Tukera a great deal, both financially and
politically, and Sildas is determined to avoid another at any cost. He
has authorized Troygvan to carry out \'black\' operation of the highest
order. Sildas simply wants Troygvan to enlist agents entirely outside
of Tukera to infiltrate, if possible, the plot, and either expose or
neutralize the leaders. Tukera has had some problems with Solomani
infiltration of Vermene in the last few years, so Sildas want\'s things
to be extremely tight on this mission. The entire affair is to be his
and Troygvan\'s eyes only. In reality, Troygvan cannot handle all the
matters himself, so some of his most closely trusted staff will also
be involved.

PC\'s

The player characters have to have never had any substantive dealings
with Tukera, or else such dealings have been very well hidden. They
should also be racial Solomani, be able to pass for such, or have
homeworlds in the Solomani sphere of influence. If the PC\'s do not fit
this profile they will have to give Troygvan very good reason to
believe they can still accomplish this mission.

Contact

Troygvan will, if possible, contact the party through a patron they
have dealt with previously. He will come to this patron with
impeccable credentials...all false, but the head of security for one
of the largest megacorps has awesome resources at his command.

Troygvan will at first attempt to convince the PC\'s that he is merely
a middle man dealing for an anonymous corporate client, perhaps an
upper manager in the Tukera organization, attempting to keep a blemish
off of his bottom line.

However, if the PC\'s are observant, they will soon notice some touches
that belie this notion. Troygvan habitually travels with a security
escort, three ex-Marine commandos, and two ex-Scout special forces
recon specialists. The security will make the PC\'s long before, if
ever, than the PC\'s will make them.

Troygan himself will travel armed (small silenced autopistol) to any
meeting, and his guards will be heavily armed, sawed off shotguns,
silenced smgs, and flash-bang grenades, and wearing \'bullet-proof\'
trench coats. Any outdoor, or accessible from the outdoors like a
restaurant window setting, meeting will be covered by one of the Scout
recons acting as a sniper with a heavy gauss rifle.

Troygvan is not a well known person; however, if one of the characters
gets a picture of him, and feeds it through a large enough photo
database, Troygvan will be identified as an executive for Tukera. At
any rate, his expensive clothes, mannerisms and clear attitude of
command make it clear that he isn\'t just any middleman. With extensive
research, if the player characters can actually access the data
sources they need, they may even be able to identify him as the
probable head of Tukera security.

Troygvan will readily agree to more than one meeting; the first will
be more \'feeling out\' for both parties, no substantive information
will be given to either side unless all parties agree. Troygvan is
looking for a cautious, methodical, professional group to do this. If
the party seems to ready to agree to anything sight unseen, he may
back out; given the current state of political affairs in the
Imperium, with rising tensions with the Solomani Confederation, some
major planetary systems fighting recession, Tukera cannot afford
anything that could spark a strike, or give it bad press.

The only thing Troygvan will say about the assignment is that it is an
internal security matter on a starship, and the PC\'s are being
recruited for an undercover operation, the pay will be generous, and
that while there are very real dangers associated with the mission, it
isn\'t anticipated to involve combat, that the PC\'s are primarily being
asked to gather intel.

Mission Briefing

If the group agrees to work for Troygvan, he will suggest a meeting
aboard his ship, a Tukera executive vessel. The PC\'s will be searched
politely but firmly, on boarding the ship. Any weapons, recorders,
etc, will be taken from them. They will receive a receipt, and be
asked to sign it, for \'Items in the Ships Locker\', listing anything
taken from them, and will be returned politely after the meeting.

The PC\'s will be shown to the wardroom, and offered refreshments. Soon
the lift warning comes over the ship\'s intercom, and the ship will
lift from the planet and head off into interplanetary space. The two
marine commandos will be in the room with them at all times, clearly
guarding the PC\'s. They will not be talkative.

About 15 minutes after lift, Troygvan will come into the room, and
dismiss the guards. and begin talking.

"I\'m sorry for the rude treatment, but this is a matter of the highest
importance to Tukera Lines, and the utmost precautions must be taken.
We have reason to believe that an illicit labor group is organizing on
a major ship of our line, possibly to provoke a strike. I want you to
go on board as employees of Tukera, and determine if there is such a
conspiracy, and if so, who is involved. We do not know how high the
conspiracy reaches, so you are being introduced as complete outsiders.
You will be in under very deep cover. Vermene has agents working in
the ships looking for these people. They will not be told of your
existence, indeed, you will have to avoid them, since I cannot
compromise your cover by interfering with this or allowing anyone else
to know about it."

"The following is for your eyes only...No one else but myself and
Sildas Tukera himself know of your relationship to Tukera, and I am
prepared to take the most extreme measures to ensure that this remains
the case."

Troygvan has not changed expression, but the tone in his voice is
clear, the PC\'s will be killed before they can expose anything.

"Naturally, I\'ll reward success, even partial success, handsomely...I
know that I am putting you in an extremely tight position, and
potentially in great danger, but if you succeed I can bring all the
resources of Tukera to bear in your behalf."

"The ship involved is the Catherine the Great, a Majesta-class
freighter currently in the Diaspora sector. Their next port of call
will be at (Insert some port in the Diaspora Sector), there is a
scheduled layover of 5 weeks there, more than enough time for us to
get there. You will be put on board as part of normal crew
replacements, into the sections that we suspect of having organizing
activity. From there on, you will be entirely on your own. When you
have achieved your mission, you will bring the evidence to the Tukera
office in the next port, get off the ship and stay there."

He hands each of the PC\'s a package. It contains a folder with the
outline of their identities, ID cards, and ship\'s transfer papers
assigning them to positions appropriate to their skills, aboard the
Catherine. The PC\'s will be assigned to areas and shifts in the ship
close to them; this way they will be able to maintain some contact.
About two third\'s of the party will have identities that show they
worked on another Tukera ship, quite a distance away from the
Catherine\'s regular route. Their personnel files will also show that
they were transferred for unspecified disciplinary reasons. Tukera
takes a rather hard stance toward labor organization, and it will be
inferred from their files that they were suspected of being involved
in either labor problems or smuggling.

The disappearance of his agent has Troygvan suspecting that the
conspiracy, if there is one, has access to the ship\'s personnel
records, either through illicit means, or by a highly ranking
co-conspirator with legitimate access, since the agent had a
classified personnel docket identifying them as a security agent.

Troygvan gives the PC\'s a moment to look through the materials, then
continues.

" It is vital that you do not lose your identity cards_they have a
special code that will identify you as a high ranking agent, reporting
only to a few people within the Vermene organization. If you are
successful, report to the Tukera office at (a list of possible ports
will be given) and only at these offices. I cannot guarantee your
safety anywhere else. From there, you will be taken to a Vermene safe
house for debriefing. Myself, or one of my associates will debrief
you."

" One final bit of assistance. Your quarters on the Catherine will
contain a silenced snub pistol, with eight rounds of ammunition.
Recognize that this is highly illegal, and if these are found while
you are on board you will be arrested and interrogated. Use them only
as a last resort, as I cannot guarantee your safety aboard the
Catherine, high security clearance or not."

" You will use the information in this packet to develop a detailed
identity for yourselves while we are in transit to (embarkation port).
Upon arrival, you will be given new clothing, what possessions you
would be expected to have, and your identity card and papers. Your
belongings on this ship will be returned to you upon the mission
completion."

The time frame Troygvan has given the PC\'s, between the
entry point and the six possible offices to report to, gives them 1 to 6 months
to achieve their goals, based on the itinerary of the Catherine.
Transit time to the `Catherine\' will be two jumps.  While in jumpspace
the PC\'s will be required to develop their identites; they will be
grilled by Troygvan and his associates, until they have everything
perfect.  If not, the failing PC will be left behind, or the mission
will be aborted, the PC\'s will be compensated lightly for their time,
and returned to where they met Troygvan, with the warning to forget
that the episode ever happened.

On board the Catherine

The PC\'s, if they have never been aboard a merchant of the Majesta
class will find themselves hard pressed to maintain their cover the
first time they are on board. The crew is larger than the population
of many small cities, and the ship itself is huge.  When a Majesta
comes into port, it takes over. Often Imperial Navy auxilaries clear
all non-Tukera or Naval vessels from the starport. The crew then takes
over the starport. Depending on the ship\'s schedule, the crew\'s
disposition, and the number and nature of the dependents on board, the
port is either flooded with crewmembers shopping and enjoying a few
day\'s shore leave, to a wild carousal. (Picture spring break in most
places in Florida, before the locals got fed up and clamped down.)

The PC\'s, however, should be able to settle down rather quickly into
the routine of shipboard life. Naturally, as the newbies on board,
they will get questions regarding their previous ship, why they\'re now
on the Catherine, etc.

 After about a week on board, if the PC\'s are observant, they will
 notice that they have occasionally seen someone who looks remarkably
 like one of the bodyguards who accompanied Troygvan to the meetings,
 and may have been aboard Troygvan\'s ship.  If contacted the person
 will deny ever having met them before, and unless the PC\'s talking to
 the woman makes a difficult perception check, will come away thinking
 that it is merely a case of mistaken identity.  In reality, it is one
 of the recon specialists sent by Troygvan to keep an eye on the PC\'s.

If they discover her, Troygvan\'s tactics become clear..there are three layers 
of investigation
going on simultaneously on the Catherine: The `official\'
investigation, the PC\'s deep cover investigation, and the scout, who\'s
only job is to watch the PC\'s. If the PC\'s are blown or killed, it is
the scout\'s job to get off the ship and return with the information to
Troygvan.  If it has become clear that the PC\'s have uncovered a
conspiracy, the scout will attempt to assassinate any identified
leader, then escape the ship.  In either case, the scout\'s escape
route is a specially prepared scout/courier in cargo module 9. Using
this escape route will gather a great deal of attention, since it will
involve blowing the doors of the module open with explosives and
firing the scout\'s thrusters to leave the ship.  This will cause
considerable damage to the ship, but Troygvan considers the risks
worthwhile, if another Great Strike is averted.

>From here the adventure could follow several scenarios:

1: The Solomani Provocation.

The PC\'s are soon contacted by a person who hints that they might well
be able to continue their labor organizing.  If they express interest,
they will be slowly drawn into a conspiracy, led by a SolSec team, to
foment a Solomani-centric strike by the crew during the ships closest
approach to the Solomani Confederation some ten ports along the
itinerary.  SolSec has four or five agents placed throughout the ship,
including one agent in the higher command structure, such as an
assistant chief security officer.

The PC\'s will be asked to recruit others in preparation for the
strike, or to perform some act of sabotage on the ship as proof of
their bona fides.  If they are successful at this, they will be
allowed access to the higher levels of the conspiracy.

The SolSec agents are quite ruthless, and the PC\'s could well have a
fatal `accident\' if their covers are compromised.

2: The `Molly Maguires\'

There is a anti-Imperial labor movement underway aboard the ship, but
it has nothing to do with SolSec.  A group of engineers are plotting a
violent strike against Tukera for the gradual loss of the concessions
gained in the Great Strike.  They feel that success in this will
encourage other starship crews to strike, and that another Great
Strike will ensue. This time they hope to gain permanent concessions
from both Tukera, the other megacorps and even the Imperium for labor
movement.

The conspiracy does not have any assistance from the command structure
of the ship, but have hacked into the data systems for their detailed
knowledge of personnel and other files.

3: Captain Raimo

The ship is carrying classified Naval hardware (an improved gravitic
focusing system) in one of the cargo containers.  The ship\'s captain
is aware of this, and being a Solomani sympathizer is desirous of
hijacking the ship to Solomani space.  The stike (with accompanying
sabotage) is a ruse to draw the 250 Imperial Marines out of their
specially prepared cargo module, whereupon in the confusion the
captain will hijack the ship, put the crew out in the lifeboats, and
fake the destruction of the Catherine.

He has the absolute loyalty of the upper levels of command, except for
the highest ranking security officer.

4: Norma Rae

The PC\'s discover a labor movement afoot, but it is one that addresses
real abuses by Tukera. In fact, if the labor organizers are persuasive
enough, the PC\'s could well decide to side with them. The organizers
want to set up a legitimate, recognized union to negotiate with
Tukera. Tukera wants to squash it. In this case, the PC\'s will have
been largely lied to by Troygvan, particularly regarding the
involvement of Solmani interests.  He is using the players to find the
leaders.  Their subsequent murders will be blamed on the PC\'s.

5: "Run-run-run-run runaway_.."

The PC\'s discover that the original agent, whose report and
disappearance started this whole affair, is simply a ruse. The agent
had embezzled a great deal of money from Tukera, and filed the report
and staged his disappearance to hide his trail.  The PC\'s get involved
in no conspiracy greater than a scheme to win a g-ball game between
two engineering shifts, since one of the PC\'s resembles a semi-pro
player known by the captain of one team, who thinks he has a ringer
to spring on the other teams.

This will not go over well with Troygvan, who really wants to believe
there is a conspiracy afoot.  He could well decide the PC\'s are lying,
at worst, covering their own part in the conspiracy; or simply
incompetent at best, and they were unable to find what was `right
under their noses\'.

GM Notes

The main thing for GM\'s to keep in mind is the sheer size of one of
these ships.  it\'s over one and a half KILOmeters long.  It has a crew
greater than many, many small cities.  No matter what scenario the GM
chooses, the ship should be a significant player in any plot.  The
PC\'s for instance could hide on one for months, scurrying from place
to place. They may need to find interesting ways to bug various parts of the
ship.  Also, since this ship should really be run less as a ship than
a company town, there are ample roleplaying opportunities beyond the
normal shipboard stuff.  The conspiracy could, for instance, take
place in conjunction with the the ongoing g-ball tournament between
different parts and shifts on the ship...what better excuse for people
to travel around the ship without attracting attention.  There could
be entire shipboard cultures unique to one of these class of ships, or
even an individual ship.  There could be things like the `Carnival
Cruise Lines\' cargo module...basically a luxury hotel built into a
standard cargo module, along with power supply, life support, etc.
The cruise company contracts with Tukera to transport their modules
along...voila\' no unneccesary ship maintenence or construction costs,
that\'s covered in the lease, which Tukera shouldn\'t charge too much
for, because in their minds, a cargo container is a cargo container.

 With these behemoths in service, suddenly the trade tables from the
 various incarnations of Traveller start (notice I said only start) to
 make sense.  Anyone on the scale of a PC is only going to be getting
 the odd spot shipment or charter...the big trade goes on these
 things. It would be sort of like attempting to figure out how modern
 maritime trade makes economic sense if all you knew about were ships
 like the dhow that Michael Palin rode across the Indian Ocean in
 `Around the World in 80 Days\'.  When someone tells you that there are
 also giant kilometer-long container ships cruising around, it makes
 much more sense.

Well, as I live a bit closer to the culture in question, I\'ll feel
free to correct a few misconceptions here.

First, Catholicism was hardly \'adopted\'; in central Mexico, to as
far north as the furthest extent of the Spanish conquest of
California, the norm was forced conversion to Catholicism.  All
traces of the \'old\' society were actively suppressed by the
benevolent missionaries.  There was a huge written body of knowledge
that the Aztec, and the Incas had, that the priests destroyed as
\'Pagan works of Satan\'. That\'s why, today, we have only a few
pitiful scraps of written history from the Aztec Empire, compared to
the libraries that existed when Cortez first waded ashore.

Second, much of the societal breakdown still didn\'t occur because
of cultural shock. Most of the destruction and depopulation of the
natives in the areas of Spanish conquest were due more to slavery
than anything else...the natives resisted working for the Spanish,
and died in droves from overwork, malnutrition, and disease.
Remember, the first Spanish were not there to tame the wilderness,
but to take as much wealth as possible as quickly as possible from
the New World (the original Smash and Grab, anyone?). Colonization
efforts didn\'t occur until quite some time after the initial
conquests.

Thirdly, take a good close look at the Catholic religion as
practiced by most of the natives of Mexico...it\'s called the
Catholic Church, but the European Church doesn\'t have brujos,
witches, healers, Days of the Dead, or any number of native
traditions that have continued quite strongly to this day.  As
elsewhere in the Caribbean, the religions and traditions of
the natives, and later, the imported African slaves, were absorbed
into an amalgam of beliefs. In some cases Catholicism is (and remains
to this day) merely a thin facade over the old beliefs.  Read about
Santeria, sometime.

What does this have to do with the Vilani conquest?  The native
traditions of Mexican indians and the Caribbean slaves survived
because they were flexible, able to take on a new appearance without
changing their fundamental core. Indeed, if you study the traditions
and folklore of these areas, you find that this is almost a universal
theme: Things aren\'t always what they appear, men can take on the
skins of animals, and vice versa, that what is important is whatever
is outside of appearance.

The rigid Vilani culture (which by this time had ceased experimental
science, or any new thinking, for over a thousand years) may not
have been able to absorb the new paradigms that the Terrans, with
their vigorous science, upward mobility, and questioning natures,
represented.

I could see the Vilani sticking to their battle plans long after it
was clear that the Terrans had found the holes in them, sticking to
their rigid chain of command, long after it was shattered, sticking
to their culture, until it, too, rather than bend or adapt, shattered
as well.

Wow, an agreement on this list?  So quickly?  How is this possible? :-)
Seriously, Susan, I agree with all your analyses and suggestions.
MegaTraveller was kind of a dippy name, and I hope the next generation

Sorry, but it\'s true, and it looks like it\'s going to be a return to

Well, I don\'t know about MT being tedious, though I suppose it could be
somewhat streamlined.  But I agree with you in general:  A quick and
simple combat system is a must.

I used to have problems with this, but then I came up with one of those
"lesser known aspects of space travel" which I like to call "jump
projects".  Essentially the player decides that his character is
practicing some skill or rigging up a new ship security system or whatever
and you resolve it with a roll at the end of each jump.  Most of these
projects take more than one week, so they cover several jumps and are
assumed to be abandonned temporarily on planetfall. At the end of several
months, the character has a new skill (or product, etc.) and his time in
jump space has been explained.  There is no need to roleplay all 150 hours
of a jump, any more than one roleplays all 24 hours of wilderness travel
in D&D.

It can also help to give characters 1D3 levels of "hobby" skills, which
must be devoted to "useless" pursuits (i.e., no sneaking in gun combat
because you like to go down to the range as a hobby).  The character thus
spends its time in J-space doing some sculpting or reading up on the
latest strategies for grav-ball.

Interesting, the pre-AFW idea is one of the backgrounds Marc Miller has
proposed for the new Traveller.  How prophetic!  I have to say, though,
that in general I disagree with the idea of making Traveller more high
tech.  High tech, carried to extremes, makes for poor roleplaying.
Chaosium put out a beautiful RPG based on Larry Niven\'s "Ringworld".  It
was a great game except for one thing: the characters\' technology made
them too bloody powerful.  They had indestructible space ship hulls,
autodocs that could bring them back from anything short of incineration
(and there were ways to survive that too!), teleporters, and pocket-sizes
weapons capable of wiping out small cities!  I\'m not exagerating, in fact
I\'m just scratching the surface!  The game designers said they had to tone
down some of the tech from LN\'s background to make the game playable.  In
my opinion they failed. LN himself said he stopped writing about this
future history because he couldn\'t think of exciting situations to put
such powerful characters in.  Star Trek has some of the same problems.
You have no doubt noticed how the TV shows always have to come up with
some cludgy reason why the transporters don\'t work (damn those tetrion
emmisions! :-).  I haven\'t played the RPG, but I wonder if this isn\'t a
problem there as well?

Another problem with super-tech games is that they limit the problem
solving aspect of roleplaying.  Because the technology is so "out there",
players can\'t bring their real-world knowledge to bear.

People seem to assume that the rate of technological increase will
continue as it is.  There is no reason to believe this.  There could
quite possibly be a slow down in development is sociocultural factors
dictate.  So the level of tech in Traveller is not implausible.
Actually, there\'s been quite a big thread on just this sort of thing on
one of the lists lately (was it Xboat?  I can\'t remember...).

> Please don\'t flame me too hard, I\'m still a newbie.

Sorry if the above sounds critical, it is not meant in that spirit.

Have a better one! (obscure Blade Runner reference).

Well, they assume that the ship/craft is a spherical shell.

Vol. = 4 Pi r^3
       -
       3

I don\'t have it in front of me, but I belive they standardized on a hull
thickness of 1cm.  The MVMs on the next page are just guidline numbers
for the various shapes, you could just as well actually calculate the
volume of an arbitrary shell if you know the geometry.

So for the basic case to get the MV (of the various tonnages as spheres)
just make a sphere that has the desired volume (thus getting the
diameter (the L in the table)).  Then make a sphere with a radius 1cm
smaller and subtract its volume from the bigger one.  This should be the
MV (or at least directly related to the MV by a constant).

the handful of hours that the zuchai crystal/energy capacitors can hold
the energy before decaying. The solution? Easy! Use the mother ship\'s JDrive

in CTrav and MTrav, as well as in FF&S) on the missile and then launch it.
The actual *active* portion of the missile is probably less than 10% of the

There was quite a long thread on this a while ago (I think it was on
xboat).  At that time, people came to the conclusion that the main problem
with jump torps was that they mess with the Traveller background.  For
instance, they make the whole x-boat network pointless.  Also, what you\'re
describing essentially amounts to a jump gate.  Why could one not expand
your idea to a ship?  There would be no particular need for ships with
their own jump drives. It would be more economical (in "civilized" areas
at least) to rent a little time hooked up to the local up-port\'s
powerplant.  Not that this wouldn\'t be a neat sort of background, but it
doesn\'t fit in with the canonical Traveller history.  The 100 ton limit is
supposed to be some kind of physical limitation, I think, and is designed
to make the Imperium have communication patterns analogous to those of the
roman empire (i.e., communication is only as fast as transportation).
Does anyone know of any canonical sources explaining the reason behind
the 100 ton limit?

Well, I think we\'re missing some arguments as to why a jump torpedo
may be feasible.  First, while it may work, it isn\'t exaclty a
guaranteed method.  More than likely, the jump torpedo will have some
sort of computer, a jump drive and jump fuel on it. Now, the same
computer that must do the final jump calculations must also store the
data to be sent.  Granted, could start the calculations on the firing
ship or dump to the torpedo from tape, but the computer on board the
torp is the one that is going to have to actually engage the j-drive.
Now, this is an action that is usually safely handled by your
well-trained engineer, so it almost always goes well.  Leave that hard
work up to just a computer.  Already you can assume that there\'s a
good chance of failure/misjump.

Automated yes, but definitely the best of solutions.  This allows the
j-torp to exist as an emergency messenger service for military ships,
yet because of the randomness of it proves that sometimes it is
important to have people behind the controls.

Yes, a 747 might appear off the end of the production line each day. But that
747 took a year or more to produce. If a Traveller Starship manufacturer had a
big enough orderbook, one starship would be \'dropping\' off the production
line a day, but each one would still take a fair fraction of a year to
produce.

Sorry, this is my first RICE Paper. The idea originated, AFAIK, with Jeff
Zeitlin (sp?-sorry!) and I don\'t think that the "A Staple Diet" reference
is mine either (but "G-Hound") as all MINE!!). Many other people have written
RICE papers, and these can be found by looking thru old digests (although wasn\'t
someone going to put them on a Web page or two?)

I hope that someone is interested enough to have a look at the Tavonni paper
and point out if I made any glaring errors (Alvin, Jeff, are you there?)
BTW, sorry about how that Amipro document came thru (as rubbish!) - I\'ll try
to re-send it in clear.

Pls note that "Bj=F6rn=F6ya Island" should read as "Byornoya Island", with
both "o"\'s having two little dots above them. Could someone from Norway
or Denmark confirm that this is the correct name for Bear Island? BTW, Andrew
Madden told me that the Net only sends 7-bit ASCII, and that the character
"o" with two dots is an 8-bit ANSI character - hence, the corruption occurred
in transmission. Doh!

If people get keen and like Tavonni, I may post some of the behind-the-scenes
background notes. For example, what better name for a Traveller than Heyerdahl?

Actually, such things have happened before.  Remember the "mummy\'s curse"

the corpses since the time of the Pharaohs, and the poor Brits had no

It may not be heroic but the one week jump time is, I believe, essential
to the entire make-up of the Traveller universe.  Fine, if you are running
a variant campaign set outside the Imperium - you can do what you like
and still maintain the integrity of your campaign universe.  If you are
trying to keep to a broadly faithful version of the GDW Imperium, then
the canon jump times are essential.  Without them the whole integrity
of the setting falls apart.  In my view the whole structure of the canon
universe is dependent upon communications being limited to the speed
of travel, and that speed of travel being sloooowwwww.

If you lose the long jump then I think you\'d have to kiss goodbye to the
feudal nature of the Imperium (no need for it), kiss goodbye to the
frontiers feel of somewhere like the Spinward Marches (why would it
feel like a frontier if it is only days away from Core?) and so on.  Your
PCs
causing havoc in some backwater?  No problem, the news will get out fast
and you\'ll find some hulking battleship jumping in system within a couple
of days.  All the military strategies currently accepted would be out the
window - if fleets can cross sectors in days it adds a whole new feel
to the way naval strategy would be composed.

As for what the characters could do during jump, well, it could be anything
from overhauling all the avionics to watching vids and bickering
amongst themselves to playing cards for ridiculous stakes (\'OK, I raise
you...this ship!\') to dressing up in drag and putting on their own revue
to practising unarmed combat to researching library data about where
they are going/what they are looking for to studying to improve some
of their intellectual or hobby skills to fitness training to knitting some
fetching new jumpers to overhauling their fusion rifles to reading the
latest bestsellers (\'I was Strephon\'s Double\') to having sex in 0G to
painting the corridors on the ship to fixing that thing that goes wrong
every jump...there must be hundreds of things that the PCs could do.
BUT most of them will be mundane.  Do you always need to tell the
players what to do during jump?  You could just tell them they are in
jump space, they do the usual things, then they arrive - do you need
to give a day by day account?  And anyway, should you be telling
the players what the characters do during jump?  Shouldn\'t they be
telling you?

Traveller is just a frame work for your own imagination, and I\'m not saying
that in your own campaign you shouldn\'t do whatever you like - the rules
and principles aren\'t gospel if you don;t want them to be - but if you wish
to stay within an already existing milieu then I suggest you have to think
very carefully before altering fundamental game mechanics which
directly influence why the setting is what it is.  Of course, I wish
somebody
had told GDW that.....

I can remember someone mentioning that the production of TNE was to
grasp "new" players and, it was said, then at the expense of some
(die hard?) CT/MT players.  The problem with a lot of people that I
talked to about TNE is that they thought that it wasn\'t "hi-tech"
enough, and the same thing goes with MT.  They looked to programs
like Star Trek and thought, "aw, come on... where\'s the warp drive?"

Traveller is one of the best sci-fi games that I know of, and this
problem with technology is what seems to have - at least in the
opinions of some of the people I talked to - put it down in their
estimation.  Maybe this should be dealt with as well as
considerations of the system that MM is will come up with (or which
system he uses as a basis).

I had a love/hate relationship with 2300AD

LOVE
----
The 2300AD background was perhaps the best ever.  I liked the
smaller scale because it allowed each world to be more fully developed
and kept the players from feeling too overwhelmed.  I liked the fact that
it was not too far in the future.  The hard SF tech environment was much
appreciated. My least favorite things about Trav always were gravitics,
psionics, and the like.  I liked the fact that in 2300AD you needed
special interface craft, catapults, and beanstalks to get into orbit and
couldn\'t just take off in your air raft.
StarCruiser had a lot of potential but the sensor rules needed
tweaking so that the "hide-and-seek-with-bazookas" flavor could come
through.  The design system was simple and I enjoyued the stealth
possibilities.
I like the politcal/economic environment more than any other RPG,
but that\'s not saying much.  The setting was 19th century colonialism
transplanted to the stars, and it worked pretty well.  I don\'t think
it would actually look like that, but it made a good gaming environment.
The Colonial Atlas was beautiful.  I go back and read it just for fun.
Having more than one colony per world provided lots of interesting
opportunities for adventures.

HATE
----
The _rules_.  Swap out the 2300AD game system and replace it with
something like the TNE house rules.  I\'d love to be able to use all of
the FF&S designs I have for 2300.  Combat was weird.  Healing either took
no time or a lot of time.  character gen could be alot more detailed.
The Kafers.  As a collector, I thought the Kafer Sourcebook was
great.  As a GM, I came to hate the Kafer.  All you could do to them was
kill them.  The Zhodane made great villains, as did the Klingons,
Romulans, the evil Imperials in Star Wars, all because there wwere
possibilities for intrigue and scheming and the kind of "we\'ll meet
agian" rivalries which players love.  The kafers were stupid killing
machines.  In Mission to Arctutus there\'s actually an inteligent Kafer
who likes Sartre, but the players are not allowed to interact with him
except in combat.  Playing in the Kafer war was too much like Twilight
2000.  Every Kafer convoy got to look alike after a while.  Sometimes it was
fun.  Blockade running was exciting, but that got old eventualy too.
The cyberpunk BS.  Not that there shouldn\'t be cybernetics,
genetic engineering, or computer networks.  But there should not by that
smug cynicism of cyberpunk.  The "Rotten to the Core " Adventure was
terrible and a cliche.  Street gangs with samurai swords?  Exotic
nightclub singers?  Evil corporate plot?  Give me a break.

SUGGESTIONS
----
What 2300AD should have stuck with was the "Troubleshooter" type
adventure.  Things Nyotekendu sourcebook with players on a giant asteroid
mining facility with a mad-man loose on board.  The "Beanstalk" adventure
was a pretty good idea too but was of low quality.  Probably the best
2300 adventure was the one printed in Challenge, "Backdoor."  Not all
advenutes can be on such a grand scale, but this one had a fantastic
backdrop and not too much combat.  Not that I don\'t like combat, it can
be very exciting, but too much of it gets monotonous.
When I wanted inspirations for 2300AD adventures I read fiction
about late 19th, early 20th century colonies in Africa, or banana
republics in Latin America.  Frontier adventures in the American arm were
good too and I actually got some good ideas from old "Bonanza" episodes.
Check out "Half the Day is Night" by Maureen F. McHugh has
seafloor banana republics, corporate intrigue, and some well-place
violence. Its a little too slow for an adventure, but it is a
well-realized, hard SF setting, with a good mix of plot elements, just
like 2300 could be.
Like most GDW games, 2300AD hass a great background and wonderful
opportunites for intriguing adventures which explore and take advantage
of it -- then they made it a wargame.  Whoever these folks are who are
thinking of reviving the game, I hope they can make it go without turning
into a hack-n-slash wargame or an oh-so-cynical cyberpunk game.

This is true for the Aztec, but for the nearby Maya people, Catholicism
came, saw conquered and became conquered by the local population.  Their
Polythestic pantheon became the saints of Catholicism.  Their "world
tree" converted into the cross.  To this day, Mayan shamens still perform
their rituals to the same people who attend the Catholic churches.
Some rituals go on even in the very courtyards and within the very
churches themselves.  Yes, the codexes were burned, the temples were
destroyed, but the culture survived.  It adapted and in turn adapted
those who conquered it.

Yes, this is true, but this is more of a case of the infusing of the
African cultures bleeding into the Mostly European but slowly changing
church of Mexico, I think the Mayan example is a better one for keeping
most of your traditions intact.

But I think this is different from the Vilani Terran problem.
I think a better example that can be used is the American
Revolution.  The Brittish, using traditional European rules of combat
could not easily handle the American Colonial style of warfare
which eventually evolved into gurella warfare.  They departed
from the expected norms and the enemy was confused.

I haven\'t been keeping closer track, but are you forgetting the
people on the xboat list?  I think a wide majority of them are in the
"return" camp.  Also, consider that the "Tweak TNE" people have more of an
axe to grind as Marc Miller seems to be leaning towards a return to CT/MT.
This is likely to make the anti-YARS forces more vocal.

Also, I haven\'t noticed the "One true faith" faction (though I\'ve
only been skimming the debate lately, so I may have missed them).  If they
exist, I think they are a fringe element which should be suppressed lest
they screw things up for everyone...

Radicals Disrupt Yorbundi Parliament.

Yorbund/Spinward Marches.

A small group of radicals calling themselves the "Converts of
Tradition" succeeded in disrupting talks between the "Moderate
Traditionalists" and proponents of "The Next Evolution" party today.
Yorbund\'s conservative and liberal parties were meeting to try to come to
an agreement regarding president Marok Mylar\'s "Yorbundi Advanced Reform
Strategem", a bill he proposed to parliament in an attempt to revive the
flagging economy of the planet.

The devout CT supporters flooded the parliament building,
waving placards and shouting "Return to the one true faith!".  Diplomats
from the MT and TNE parties were unable to quiet them long enough to get
discussions under way.  Said one spokesperson for MT "I want to make it
clear that these are simply a radical fringe element, they do not
represent the position of my party."

The debate over Mylar\'s YARS paper has been raging ever since he
proposed it a month ago.  While the parties bicker, Yorbund\'s economy
remains in a state of depression...

Actually, I quite like it, for several reasons:

1. It\'s one of the few situations where the party is totally alone, with
no contact with the rest of the universe. Good for murder mysteries etc.

2. My campaign was getting left behind by the \'real\' timeline (when GDW
announced the assassination, I was still in 1114). After a couple of
scenarios involving lots of travel, I was back on schedule (those weeks
really mount up quickly).

3. If you\'re feeling short of ideas, or you accidentally left the scenario
notes at home, just ask the players to role-play through the week in jump.
Trust me, they\'ll soon find lots of entertaining things to do (mostly
involving ways of killing each other...)

I haven\'t kept track, but I thought it was time to throw out my 2 credits
worth. :-)

I have played Traveller from the days where there was just the three little
books.  I have been through the peaks and valleys of this game.  The day
they stopped producing JTAS was the day the game died in my opinion.  TNE
was a last ditch effort to save the game by GDW.  TNE had some nice things
about it, but I found it difficult to digest, as well as ref.   Frankly, the
little books were the best to read.  The system was simple, and the refs and
Marc/GDW were creative.  I got the Regency Source Book by mail order.  I
have 20-15 vision and I just about refuse to read a book with that small print.

If I were going to take over, here is what I would do.  I would take the CT
rules and republish them with the art, and Traveller TL advances of the MT era.
Combat has been a pain in the but since Snap Shot and Mayday to the point
that I either avoid combat or generalize it.  Frankly I liked the days where
I made a chart of weapons vs armor and if a player had an ACR shooting DS
rounds vs Cloth, I just looked it up on the card, found the to-hit roll, let
them roll the dice, if they hit they did damage.  There was none of this
number of dice of penetration trash to use.  Roll to Hit, Roll to Damage,
Dead or Alive.  Simple.
Computers have to come back the way they were in CT.  Many adventures were
built around getting the "Jump Tape" to get from here to there.  It also
kept ship combat and construction simple as well.

Another key point is Gaming materials are reference material.  One of my
dislikes about GURPS and TNE is that you have to search a lot harder to find
the answers to a question than you do with AD&D and CT/MT.  TSR has produced
the best monster books of any company.  One monster per page, alphabetical
with cool art.  World Building.  Go to the book on Worlds.  Side bars and
stories are a waste in a rule book.  Put them in your magazine, or in your
adventures, but don\'t include them in the rules.  Character Generation,
World or Ship Generation should start on page n, and go step by step to page
n+x.  None of this do a couple of steps, jump ahead a section to look up
details, now come back stuff.

Traveller has a wealth of background material and that needs capitalized on.
One other thing that I would like to see is a way that players individual
campaigns can be incorporated in the whole.  Maybe a way to submit TNS
reports to Marc and he can work in the events into the history.  We have had
some success with this kind of networking on a small scale within our AD&D
world.  Events in three states and four campaigns effect the other.  With
our electronic world, we should be able to do this.  Admittedly someone has
to have editorial control over it or Duke Norris would get killed by an
assassin somewhere that may mess the game up for 99% of the other campaigns.
Instead of a few people shaping the universe, let the universe shape itself.

On the campaign setting, I personally enjoyed the times of the 5th Frontier
War, and the ability to go into the areas around the Spinward Marches and
explore uncharted worlds.  I didn\'t care for adventuring in the Solomani Rim
because it was too developed.  The problem with MT\'s setting is that
everything is too defined.  TNE tried to un define a bunch of stuff, but I
had to work hard to keep my players from just going around looting.  So I
would like to see stuff coming out circa 1111, but its real hard to play in
a setting where the history is already defined.  You know the rebellion is
coming, and that virus will hit.  So the setting becomes a hard call.

One final thought, when CT was out, there was new stuff coming out
frequently and it was affordable.  MT came out, and I think could have been
successful if it wasn\'t for the horrid editing, but the larger books were
expensive and were less frequent.  TNE came out and carried a big price tag,
and didn\'t come to market quickly (admittedly this had to do with reduced
staffing, and lack of sales).  Any thing new will have the same barriers.
Come out with a revised set of rules based on CT and sell it at $25-$30, but
the release supplements monthly or bi-monthly at $10 each.  I don\'t know
why, but I will pick up a $10-$14 item and not think about it, but when that
price gets to be $15-$20+, I hesitate on buying it, particularly if the
material is not completely new.

Look at the success of tradeable card games.  You can take a $10 to lunch,
stop at the book store and then spend your change to pick up a couple of
booster packs while that new supplement sits on the shelf because you don\'t
want to pull out the VISA or check book to pick it up so again smaller is
better.

Ok, it was more like 25 credits worth....

Yes, nothing like having an illness start to sit in during the first day in
JSpace, and then on Day two have passangers start turnnig up dead, only to
find the great calcium sucking beast in the cargo hold munching on the chief

I read a Travellereusque book once, don\'t remember the title, but they had
jump points.  The week of  travel was spent getting to and from the jump
point, but no time was spent in the jump.  Kept them in real space for
naughty things, but still took time.  Still I like my 1 week in J-Space.  I
found that the calendar that was printed in the back of the Forms supplement
(12 I think) The left half of the calander was in jump space, the right half
was planet side.  Made planning easy.

I think that Modern jet production makes a very good model to base
starship production times on, so let me just add a few bits of
information I found in variuos new bits from
Beoing(http://www.boeing.com).

The first of a new Freight version of the 767 started production in
January of 1995 and was rolled out of the hanger in May,  a production
cylce of 3 to 5 months.  Flight testing on the plane started in June
\'95 and in October the Plane was delivered to the customer UPS.  The
total time for this version of the 767 from inception to customer
delivery was 29 months.

Conversions on 747s from passanger to cargo craft take about 4 months.
I would guess that the production cycle for a new 747 would be from 4
to 8 months.

Also it seems that the shortest time that a customer can expect to
receive delivery on an aircraft from time of order is about 6 months,
with most taking a year or two.

Now these are peacetime production rates, wartime time production rates
would probably result in dramatic reduced production cycle time, maybe
something like a 747 being built in a month.  Wartime of course would
make it much harder for characters to get a ship built for personal
use.

With advances in technology production cycle times will be reduced.  On
the other hand this can be offset with increases in complexity of the
craft being built.

a month. This year, Boeing plans to increase that rate to 3.5 a month.

What, we finally develop a ship\'s engine capable of propelling us at
outrageous relativistic speeds (up to 1020x the speed of light at Jump-6)
and it\'s still not fast enough for you?  Geez...

If the standard "one week per jump" isn\'t quite enough for you, try this on
for size:  try scaling the jump times.  For example, supposing your PC
party is outfitted with the ubiquitous Scout/Courier.  Standard travel
times are one week for a 2-parsec jump and about 3-4 days for a 1-parsec
jump.  Similar divisions apply to ships with higher jump speeds.  It
changes things a bit, but not drastically.

1) That 747 that rolls off the production line twice a day (or more) as
being the end result of a year\'s work. Well, yes. But so what? If you trace
it back to each separate component, quite possibly some of them had to be
ordered more than a year before the actual day of production. Again, so what?
In a mass production situation, this is not a major concern, because, like
Henry Ford, you are producing in advance of orders anyway, in order to keep
the price down so that you can make a small profit on a lot of things rather
than a lot of profit on a few.

In any case, we are *not* talking Industrial Revolution technology here,
we are talking *post* IR production tech. Even the crippled sort of factories
that I suggest Traveller has (as opposed to the ones that I proposed in my
Secret Histories post) should be far more efficient than ourt current
ones. For ghu\'s sake, we\'re looking some 3.5 millennia into the future!
It should be the case that the factories/shipyards produce everything at
once from stockpiled raw materials run through robotic refining and milling
machines ... at that level of tech this should be no problem at all. Yet we
are looking at 20th century limitations.

I do not see that you have a valid point given the advances in production
tech that we can reasonably assume must have occurred in the 3500 years or
so into the future of the Traveller background. This is, of course, Travs
main problem, the future is so backward!

2) Liberty Ships being "throw aways". Well, according to my 86/87 "Combat
Fleets of the World", the US National Defence Reserve Fleet has quite a
number of Liberty/Victory Ships in mothballs for reactivation in emergencies.
OK, they haven\'t done a lot of steaming in that time, but they\'re still
intact (tho I believe that they were slower to reactivate for the Gulf War
than planned for) ... and a lot of the USN supply and support vessels are
WW2 (even pre-WW2) vintage. And *they* have seen service for all those years.
Nope, Liberty and Victory ships *and* all the "mass produced" designs made
for WW2 were just as long lived in most cases as their predecessors and
successors. Thus, building a crappy little 100 ton Scout/Courier shouldn\'t
take longer than a day, and this should have no adverse effects on their
longevity.

3) Jump Missiles: Hmm, so my proposition allows *larger* spacecraft to dispense
with the power stage of JDrives. Of course it does! This isn\'t something I
just proposed off the cuff, it\'s actually a part of my formal background.
Why, then, doesn\'t the Imperium use them *officially*. Well, we know that
the Vilani are ultraconservative, we know that they have tainted even the
3rd Imperium irrevocably with their brand of unltraconservative blindness.
So, the answer is obvious ... the idea has been suggested, probably many
times, but has always been rejected because its *not* the "way things have
always been done!"

        No, my "gut feeling" was based on both. Since I was receiving
everything as individual messages until a few days ago, I didn\'t even notice
which list a message came from. Unfortunately, work\'s been sapping my time
and energy, so I had to drop off the XBOAT to cut down on the size of my

Two objections, here. First, the Brits had LOTS of experience with
that kind of warfare, and very recently, too; the French and Indian
wars, fought 1754-63. They won that one, despite the \'dirty\' way the
French and their indian allies fought. Second, and far more
important, the Revolutionary war was, in the main, fought by European
rules...large set-piece battles.  There was a lot of guerilla style
fighting at the beginning, and on the frontiers (witness Etan Allen\'s
Green Mountain Boys), but believe me, the war was won on European
rules...that\'s why Lafayette, Pulaski, et. al. saved our butts...they brought
the experience, and money to afford a continental style army.  That\'s what
beat the Brits, not any patriots hiding behind trees with their
squirrel guns. Those patriots got us through some hard times, to be
sure, and were an important part of the war, but it was the
Continental Army that brought Cornwallis to bay.

Even in the classic guerilla style warfare of today, such as the
Vietnam war, the true guerilla forces didn\'t win the battle.  In that
case, the Viet Cong were largely destroyed during the Tet Offensive
of \'69; the people who won the war were the NVA. They used some
low-tech guerilla style tactics, but were much more a regular army
with armor, artillery, etc.

But, I agree, the Vilani were beaten by their inability to adapt,
both culturally and technologically.

And, on an unrelated note, the Victory Ships of WWII should hardly
be held up as examples of how to build things...they did do some
amazinly innovative things, and changed the ship construction
business fundamentally, but a distressing number of them also simply
sank of their own accord.  I would look to things like aircraft
carrier or oil tanker construction as a better model of starship
construction than 747\'s, personally.

I see Phillips point, but I think that there is a bit of a difference
here.  Just how many ships of a given type are there?  I always assumed
that many ships are built from standard designs, but that doesn\'t mean
the shipyard is cranking them out at one a day... they might never have
built one of this type, but at least the plans are around and known to
work well.

On high pop, high tech worlds, I\'d expect much higher rates of
production, though (I basically agree with you).  To follow the
production line idea; you need to have the next part to be put in
already made when the ship gets to that step.  What if you don\'t make
that part at your yard?  What if it comes from another system?  Any
production delays, plus jump time...

I would think that something like a Rampart, or a heavy fighter, I\'d
expect some centralized manufacture.  Then I\'d see many units a day
being made.  One concept would be to say that "standard" designs are
actually made in fewer yards.  Then they are dropped off like cars by a
bulk carrier.  Then production time would be nil :-)  "Sure, I\'d rather
have the red, but if all you\'ve got is silver... I\'ll just fly it off if
you\'ll knock 0.5MCr off the top."

But I guess the real issue is custom built ships.  I would say if the
yard has a warm production line on a given type, the time should be damn
short, otherwise having it take several months doesn\'t bother me at all.
Even with very high TL prodution techniques, custom designs might take a
while for a number of reasons...

1.  Jump drives (grids, coils, whatever) might need to be ordered from a
Jdrive manufacturer.  I mean if the drive isn\'t a straight plug in model
(a la Book 2) the drive, jump grid, etc. have to be custom made for the
ship.  I always treated Lanthinum of Jdrive purity kinda like dilithium
in ST, or spice in Dune.  It\'s *the* basic requirement for an
interstellar society, and it is rare enough that the
refinement/manufacture of Jdrives might not happen even at every A
starport.

2.  Testing.  Mentioned in another post.  Takes 2 weeks assuming no
problems.  Any problem requires another 2 weeks (jump out, jump back).

3.  Tool up.  This would be shorter and shorter at higher TLs, due to
factor Phillip mentioned.

I\'m sure there\'s more.  Just a few credits worth.

        Can\'t we get a reasonable medium between the \'70s Traveller rules
and modern rules? I really like the newer stuff much better, but I agree
that simplifying it a bit could be a Good Thing ((TM) by Merrick Burkhardt,
I think).

        Different folks, different strokes ... I _liked_ the new rules the

the firefight was going on.

        But this is _exactly_ one of the things I always had problems with
in D&D, and in CT when I dropped D&D in favor of Traveller. My chances of
hitting a man-sized object have absolutely nothing to do with what covers
that object. Once I have hit it, however, the damage will depend on that
covering. As a player, I always want to know whether I hit or not SEPARATE
from whether I did damage. In fact, I shouldn\'t really know how much damage,
if any, I did, other than by how my target reacts. And as a ref I\'ve played
it that way: the player rolled to see if he hit the target, but I took care
of penetration and damage -- " ... He staggers a bit backwards, then drops
down behind a dumpster" is about all the player was told. Maybe I told him
if he saw blood or not, depending on how severe the damage actually was, and
where.

         And I like the idea of doing impact trauma even if I don\'t
penetrate. I understand a bullet will leave quite an impressive bruise
through a kevlar vest, for example. To me, the penetration is PART of the
Roll to Damage.

        Disagree, and many other people seem to disagree as well. The
biggest complaint about computers I\'ve seen is how "non-advanced" they are.
The very idea of a jump tape is anathema.

        As for keeping construction simple ... don\'t forget the gear-heads.
Check out the suggestions everybody\'s made for a NonGearHead (NGH)
plug-n-chug design system along the lines of Book 2/High Guard which is a
compatible subset of Fire, Fusion and Steel II. I\'ve consolidated _my_
perception into two pages:

        http://www2.csn.net/~goldenj/traveller/T4Letter.html
                A letter to MM about how I\'d like to see Traveller 4 ...
about halfway down the page is a discussion of FF&S2 and FF&S2 Lite (NGH)

        http://www2.csn.net/~goldendj/traveller/DesignNotes.html
                Possible organization for NGH

        I see the NGH system being the one in the basic set (book 2, of
course), while the full-up FF&S2 would be a supplement.

        Conservative use of side bars can really flesh out the rules, but I
agree. MT, and to a greater degree TNE, showed way too much "flash." And I
would like a better layout for accomplishing things, putting everything you
need for a particular task in one place.

        Another thing ... Brilliant Lances did a great job with those
reference cards for combat, putting a step-by-step chart and all the needed
procedures on a single sheet. Do that for combat.

There are a lot of people who like realistic systems, and that is fine.  A
lot of people like Rol(l)eMaster.  However, I don\'t like games where it
takes more real time to resolve a combat round than it actually consumes in
game time.  A 1 minute AD&D combat round can be resolved in a few seconds
per person.  A 1 second combat round in GURPS can take 30-60 seconds to
resolve.  In CT the 6 second combat rounds could be resolved individually in
about that amount of time.  The 5 second TNE combat rounds take about 20-30
seconds to resolve.  Its kinda like driving down the road and wanting to
drive at least 60 MPH (1 mile per minute) any less and I feel inefficient.

This one I am a bit flexable with.  I personally didn\'t care much for the
software system of old, but many of my players have really said they liked
that aspect of the game.  I suspect that it is mostly due to the fact that
they are AD&D players mostly and they need the "treasure" rewards for the
game to be fulfilling.  They saw these jump-tapes as something that could be
bartered and were kinda rare.  It that part I like.  The parallels to real
computing are horrid, and admittedly, I kinda like saying your ship has a
computer with the software to get it going.  Having a computer that is more
Star Trek\'ish like is also a bit appealing.

GH\'s or NGH\'s doesnt matter, but if the publisher publishes standard
materials, such as supplements and adventures that uses GearHead statictics,
then the NGH\'s are hosed.  Having the ability to set and play for hours
alone with FFS is cool (assuming of course that it was organized well and
usable).  I consider myself a reasonably bright person, and I have never
gotten a successful vehical built with FFS.  I built several vehical with
MT.  The system was at least understandable, but it took too long.  Time is
a precious comodity.  If I need a special starship for an adventure, I would
rather spend the time on the deck plans and stocking it with "monsters and
treasure" than figuring out if the theoretical reaction mass of the
thrusters would be sufficient to permit navigation while leaving excess
power to assure that the anti-grav plates would remain functional while
having a hard enought hull to reject space debris.

Sorry, give me a 200 ton hull, the engines that go J2 2G and let me get busy
drawing....

Finding the proper mix between reality and playability is a rough thing for
a game developer to find.  I don\'t consider TNE playable.  MT was pushing
the threshold a bit more than I liked.  With TNE I purposly avoided space
combat and the few times I couldn\'t avoid it, I abstracted it out of the
players control.  I was not about to waste a good 30 minutes or more of the
session getting out Brilliant Lances, setting up the game board, filling out
forms and stuff for something that frankly should take no more than 5
minutes to deal with.

The players that I ref and game under are Role players.  We are concerned
with the story and playing the game.  We arn\'t concerned with real-world
physics.  We have to deal with enough of that during our Real lives.  Even
in our Real Lives we don\'t want to think of a lot of these problems as well.
I don\'t care what the hull strength of my mini-van is, or the excess power
produced from the alternator.  Does it get me from here to there and haul
what I need hauled.  What are my expenses in operating it, lets go.  I don\'t
care what the foot-pound power of the shell, and the arc factor\'s of a
handgun that I am buying.  Will it defend me, and when I shoot that terrible
four footed drool dog, will it no longer bother me.

I want a game where the publisher is going to spend their creative energies
providing a way cool place to adventure and not get caught in the
micro-management of everyday items.  Lets see more background supplements on
NPCs and planets.  Things like the RICE papers done here are increadble
examples of what I would like to see in Traveller.  My group is going to
Efate, what can I as a DM describe to them is there.

I don\'t want to say "You are in Efate.  Its a world.  You cross the path of
someone who doesn\'t like you.  A fight breaks out, you pull out your TL15
Advanced Combat Rifle with APFSDSDU rounds and fire a burst of three rounds.
Lets see, the first hits his kevlar vest and 890 foot/pounds of force are
lost, leaving 280 foot/pounds.  This causes a grade three nural damage to an
area 13 cm around the impact area.  This causes a small trickle of blood to
emminate from his mouth as he collapses to the ground.

Its better (IMO) to say "You have travelled to Efate.  Its a world under
policial seige by the Jhymkara Rebals.  They spot you leaving the starport,
and mistake your starburst symbol for a faction of the Church of the One
True Way, and begin a fight.  You pull out your ACR with APFSDSDU rounds and
fire.  You dropped a rebal and now can escape.

Any way, enough rambling, and I will quietly go back to monitor mode.

 LS Michael Crichton   A contract biowarfare research facility.

The LS Crichton was a specialized ship, heavily modified from a
Kashuggin class modular freighter (large, streamlined,with modules
attatched, Jump 4 ca 50-60,000 tons, someone else can try doing the
complete design ).  The Crichton was designed to
be a self-contained biowarfare lab ship, one that covered all aspects,
from design and construction of the agents, to culturing to field-test
levels, to field testing and evaluation of the agents.  There a many
confirmed reports of biological weapons being used during the
Rebellion, and the Crichton was actually deployed several years prior
to the rebellion, and was originally used as an epidemic response
facility, not biowarfare; that use came after the start of the
Rebellion.

 The ship consisted of four, self contained 10 kton modules in
 addition to the freighter\'s functional backbone. Each module has it\'s
 own TL 15 computer system, life support, power, laboratory and crew
 quarters. Actual crew requirements were minimal, since, as a safety
 feature, each lab system was heavily roboticized.  All manipulations
 of any agents took place in physically isolated sections of the lab
 modules, under either robotic or remote contol by the human crew.
 Three of the four modules were synthesis, diagnosis and production
 (SDP) facilities, the fourth was a survey and field testing (FT)
 unit.

Each of the three SP units was specialized to one of three main
targets of the agents: Sophont, plant and animal agents. in this
fashion the peculiar environmental and test subjects required for all
three fields of research did not share any facilities, reducing
cross-contamination risks.

Field testing ready agents were sealed into uniform delivery
canisters, and transported through decontamination airlocks to the
FT unit.  The agents were then to be delivered to the target site,
and monitored via remote control sensor platforms and orbital
reconnaisance.

The sensor suites, however, are very good, and cover a wide range of
data types.  The remote sensor platforms were equipped with sampling
devices and modified security robots that could recover just about
anything from a bacterium to a large domestic animal.  If necessary
the FT unit also had light battledress with full CBW protection for
the use of researchers if necessary. Vaccsuits with full CBW
capabilities were avaliable in the SDP modules in case of an
emergency.

The Crichton itself was rather heavily armed, with 4x4X4 systems (4
laser batteries, 4 missile batteries, and 4 sandcaster batteries,
each battery consisting of 4 weapons each) a common Solomani
merchant heavy defense package. The Crichton was also modified to perform
orbital bombing of planetary sites...this was to be done with nuclear
weapons, and was intended to sterilize the site of infection if
desired. When this story started it had 25 such weapons on board.

The Solomani corporation that owned the Crichton was ElsenGen
Biologicals, ostensibly a pharmeceutical R&D corporation based on
Fornorb, an industrial center in the Magyar sector . ElseGen had
gotten covert Solomani Defense contracts to do research into
biowarfare weapons and defenses; they were given the SS Greenhope,
which was a Kashuggin class modular freighter converted to a
epidemic response hopsital ship.  ElseGen refit the Greenhope
extensively, and renamed it the LS Michael Crichton, after a late XXth
Century Terran writer who wrote a novel about an extraterrestrial
plague.

Somehow, publicity got out that the true purpose of the Crichton and
the programs funding it were to develop offensive weapons.
Solomani High Command got cold feet regarding the use of biowarfare
weapons and shut down the ElseGen projects. The ElseGen Corporation
itself was discredited badly; the stock plummeted to nothing, and
the corporation was dissolved.  The executive officers of ElseGen
were arrested by Fornorb authorities, and convicted and executed on
charges of terrorism. A core group of ElseGen technicians and
scientists, enraged at the Solomani Confederation\'s desertion of
them, stole the Crichton, and vanished into the Dark Nebula sector.

A year later a ship jumped into the Fornorb system, with a very high
speed entry vector for Fornorb, and after a brief battle, destroyed
the SDB that attempted to intercept it.  The mystery ship made no
attempt to stop at Fornorb, but dropped a number of what appeared to
be small self-guided re-entry submunitions. They all apparently
burned or broke up in the upper atmosphere.

Soon, however, the sickness started. A new, multi-drug resistant
disease appeared, apparently simultaneously, in all areas of the
planet. The disease had a rapid course, producing death in 7 to 10
days in over 95% of the cases, and was rapidly spread via airborne
contact.  Millions died in the first month, and the Confederation
had to quarantine the planet, and watch helplessly as the formerly
high poulation planet dwindled to a few thousand survivors. SolSec
analysis of  remaining sensor and \'black-box\' data from the wreckage of
the SDB showed that the mystery ship seemed to be of Aslan design,
with no identifiable clan or other markings.

One of the submunitions failed to re-enter the atmosphere, and
months after the outbreak of the plague, a recovery team captured it
before the orbit decayed. The provenance of the submunition was
unmistakable; it was Solomani in design, and in fact, bore a lot
number corresponding to one issued to ElseGen for testing purposes.
It contained a previously unknown virus in aerosol dispersal
containers. Analysis of the virus showed that it was the one causing
the plague.  This enabled a vaccine to be rapidly developed, which
brought the disease under control on Fornorb.

Solomani reaction to this was muted, for they couldn\'t very well
castigate the Aslan publically for using biowarfare without Solomani
involvement in ElseGen coming out.  Privately, the Hierate
Intelligence service also examined the evidence and were also unable
to positively identify the ship involved.  The Hierate, however,
reassured the Confederation on the honor of the Hierate that they
were not actively engaged in biowarfare against the Confederation.

In any case, the Critchton was never seen in Confederation space again.

Fragmentary reports out of Aslan Hierate space indicate that the
ship travelled through the Dark Nebula sector hiring out services to
ihatei leaders invading Imperial space in the Trojan Reach and
Spinward Marches sectors.  There is sketchy evidence that the
Critchton was behind \'designer\' plagues in several sectors during the
end stages of the Rebellion 1120-1130, possibly including whatever
caused the disease on Hexos (Spinward Marches 2828) .  The last
confirmed appearance of the Crichton was in Zarushagar in 1126. The
ship was presumed lost in the chaos following the release of Virus.

strains that have taken over the ship.

----

The Critchton was an unusual ship, in that it had 5 separate TL-15
computer systems.  When it was infected with Virus, 5 separate
personalites emerged: rojan, Lander, Gateway, GreenMom, and Doc.

Trojan eventually became a Empire Builder-Doomslayer hybrid,
controls the ships main systems, including jump drive, weapons, and
fuel collection and purification.

Lander is the computer that controlled the field testing units, and
was damaged during an encounter with a puppeteer strain in 1175.
Control over it\'s robotic landers is not perfect anymore, and it trusts no
one but Trojan now.

Gateway is a Hobbyist/Empire Builder, it runs the animal agent
module with rather murderous efficiency in support of Trojan\'s hatred
of living things.

Doc is a Hobbyist/God strain, with a rather twisted sense of humor.
Doc controls the sophont module.  It will make agents for Trojan to
inflict on mostly human populations, but they won\'t always mesh with
Trojan\'s plans, since Doc will often decide to experiment with
different effects. Doc, however, has the largest number of self
mobile robots, and it therefore has a stranglehold on Trojan, who is
dependent on Doc\'s robots for maintenance. There are three human
populations in Zarugashar sector with heritable color changes wrought
by Doc plagues. One is bright orange (from the accumulation of
carotenes from the diet), another has zebra stripes running over
their bodies, and yet another has blue, irridescent spots instead of
body hair.

GreenMom is a withdrawn pure Hobbyist. It is entirely self absorbed
in it\'s own module, growing different plant things. Trojan once, in
order to coerce GreenMom into supplying a plant plague, shut off
GreenMom\'s fuel supply. Before the fusion reactor in GreenMom\'s
sector went entirely dead, large sections of GreenMom\'s hull were
replaced from within by extremely tough material, transparent to the
wavelengths optimal for photosynthesis.

GreenMom\'s systems slowly came back to full power, all contacts
with Trojan or the rest of the ship except for a single low speed
communication line were cut off, and the fusion reactor went cold.
Trojan has no recourse but to physically destroy GreenMom, and that
would potentially cause great damage to itself and the other modules.
Since that time, GreenMom has bartered mutated plants and plant
agents with Trojan in return for carbonaceous and metallic asteroid
material. A planet in the Gushemege sector has one of those mutated
plants, a rapidly growing strain of kudzu vine that has wiped out all
other life on three of the four continents of the planet.

Trojan uses agents developed, primarily by Doc and Gateway, to
barter for parts and supplies it needs with other vampires and
fleets. It has also subjugated some human planets with the threat of
plague for needed maintenence. It is quite successful at this;
coupled with the large number of adaptable robots on board, and the
minimal combat damage the Crichton has taken over the intervening
years, means that the ship is in quite good shape.

A true survey of the wilds would show over a hundred diseases and
invasive plants and animals that have been released by the Crichton
and others over the years.  Trojan has convinced three other ships
to join it\'s fleet; all jump capable warships.

The Crichton is a dangerous and implacable foe; this should never
be a vampire that the PC\'s beat in battle, but a ghost, or a rumor of
a terrible destroyer of life.  The PC\'s should encounter it\'s effects
more often than they ever encounter the ship.

Anyone running such a munchkin campaign that the PC\'s DO take on the
Crichton and win should be aware that the three SDP modules Doc,
Gateway, and particularly GreenMom, are priceless troves of
biotechnology.

Daring PC\'s, (along with RCES Peacekeeper allies) could even co-opt
GreenMom, by giving it access to materials, and an environment more
conducive to its obsession. However, never expect anything very
quickly from GreenMom...it runs on plant timeframe. Slow, very slow.

5Medium (Bedridden)10Extreme (Hospital)
6Medium (Bedridden)11+Extreme (ICU)
Explanations:
Agent Type: What kind of infectious agent this diseased is caused by.
This will affect how these agents are encountered, transmitted, etc.

Vector Type: How the agent is delivered to the target area

Lethality: How many UNTREATED people die from the agent, randomly
spaced through the Acute phase time period.  This can be very
important...a high lethality over a very long acute phase, you get
something like AIDS, over a short acute phase you get something like
Ebola.

Transmission type: Once the agent is introduced into the population
via the vector above, how is the disease transmitted from person to
person.  This will drastically affect the countermeasures taken.

Contagiousness: the chance that someone will contract the
disease...this needs to have some time value associated with it, which
will depend on a lot of external factors. This, as it applies to
player characters will have to be determined by the GM on an ad hoc
basis.

Systems Affected: This is the major organ system affected by the
agent.  This will affect what physical effects, gory details, and
recovery effects there will be.

Incubation Time: The time, after initial infection, the person is
asymptomatic.  However, for many, if not all diseases, the patient is
contagious, though usually to a lesser degree than during acute phase.

Acute Phase time: The time during which the patient has the acute
disease manifestation.  If the patient dies, it will most likely be
during this time, so this is when the patient must save vs lethality,
using the percent generated above.  For player characters, the GM will
probably want to introduce some modification, based on CON, or
medicval skill of other players or NPC\'s.

Recovery Phase time: This is the time which is required for full
recovery from the illness, barring any optional permanent effects
imposed by the GM.

Morbidity: How sick you actually get during the acute phase.  This is
obviously going to be affected by the lethality...a highly lethal
agent is not going to make you only minorly sick, so it goes from 2-11
by adding the lethality roll.  I truncated this at Extreme (ICU)
because there\'s not really much higher you can get.

 These tables are a rough draft. All are generated using one D10.  The
 GM is left much to his/her own devices for any lingering effects
 during recovery, and any and all gory details.  Permanent or
 temporary loss of STR, perhaps CON, maybe even INT (Remember those
 horrific 106 degree fevers burn lots of brain cells) are all possible
 effects.  Certainly the character is affected somewhat during the
 recovery process.

 Remember, while TL 15 medicine may be miraculous, most characters,
 and indeed most of the affected populations were not able to avail
 themselves of such care. It wouldn\'t take much of an pandemic to
 bring the US healthcare system to its knees, and what happens when
 your doctors are among the first to die (they are among the first to
 be exposed...)?

Biological Warfare, some practical points.

 Biological warfare, in general, like chemical warfare, does not seek
 to simply kill as many people as possible.  The ideal agent will not
 only kill, but take long enough to do so that many more people are
 involved in caring for the sick (and risk getting sick themselves).
 The object is to tie up as many enemy personell as possible for the
 longest possible time.  An ideal agent will make people very sick for
 a long time, BUT with a low lethality rate, but high incapacitation
 rate, so you end up with a growing pool of recovering but non combat
 worthy personnel.  This will further strain the resources of your
 enemy, since, if the disease is survivable with sufficient care,
 enemy morale will suffer greatly if the resources for that care
 aren\'t allocated.

 Tactical uses of BW are also numerous.  If you could cause 60-70% of
 the enemy to come down with a minor, but incapacitating stomach bug
 24 hrs before your assault, you\'ll be in good shape.

 BW also doesn\'t require nearly as high tech as nukes, even.  Once the
 basic principles of bacteriology and virology are known (TL 4-5???)
 BW becomes a possibility.  In our history it was used even before
 these principles were known, but I doubt some TED is going to want to
 release a plague without at least being able to protect himself from
 it.

 This system can also be used to generate natural plagues on lower
 tech level worlds.  The PC\'s could land on Boondock 1, a TL-3 planet,
 during the Black Death, for instance, or a cholera epidemic. They
 could also become big heroes by `miraculously\' saving locals.
 However, the higher the TL, the less likely that large epidemics are
 going to occur, due to improved medical care, understanding of the
 disease process, and better sanitation, so if the PC\'s run into
 something like this on a higher TL world, it will most likely be due
 to a BW agent, either deliberately released, or, ever so much fun for
 those salvage people, accidentally released agents left over from
 rebellion era BW munitions: "Hey Joe! Ever hear of this Model
 6745BW45-5-23-9 105 mm shell? It looks funny, like this little cap
 here..." <snap> <hisssss> "...ooops!"

 Introducing BW into the Trav universe is a little like the endless
 discussion in some circles about throwing big rocks...if it\'s so
 effective and cheap, why doesn\'t everyone do it? The same reason it
 isn\'t done here on Earth...fear of retaliation, and the even greater
 fear of not being able to control it.  Biological weapons can easily
 turn and bite the wielder, even more so than nukes or chemical
 weapons.  After all, nukes and nerve gas doesn\'t mutate and become
 immune to your carefully hoarded stocks of antibiotics, serums and
 vaccines.

 It will only be used by someone desperate or fanatical enough to not
 care anymore...how often did this happen, in the chaotic waning days
 of the Third Imperium?

don\'t spend a lot of time covering in actual "roleplaying" time.

Most often, they attempt to train each other in various disciplines using
Instruction skill.  Since my current campaign is a mercenary campaign that\'s
been running just over a year now, you can probably see this causes problems for
me.  For one thing, on long trips after all the Instruction skill use, everybody
would end up with _huge_ skill increases after imparting experience points to
one another.  It got to be such a runaway problem for me that I had to put a cap
on it.  I determined that in order to gain a specified level of skill via
someone else\'s Instruction skill, the _square_ of the desired skill level in
experience points was required.  That toned them down a bit.

I also mentioned that maintenance of equipment, calisthenics, review of mission
parameters and other activities (not to mention leisure time -- e.g., zero-G
sex, watching holovids and reading cyberbooks) takes more time than they may
have thought.

On the other hand, a referee occasionally has to throw in some obligatory
in-jump roleplaying time as red herrings to counter those times you\'ve actually
_planned_ for something to happen in jump.  Otherwise you have sarcastic players
saying, "Uh-oh, he\'s refereeing us in jump.  Something must have stowed away on

you have to remember the relative TL of each opponent favours the
home opponent that knows the terrain.  In the example of the
aztecs vs spain, then the aztecs did not have gunpowder or the wheel, or
the horse.  Spain had all three.
In the american independance, both groups were roughly equal in TL
the reason why one succeded was due to the vast resorces avaliable
to the american side, britian would have required to send more troops
accross the atlantic - possibly dangerous at that TL.
more recently you have the vietnam and korea conflicts.
both can be said to have favoured the home team.
And also to consider is the psychological effect of being far from home.

Just for a "State of the List" update:

TML has 452 Subscribers
XBOAT has 357 Subscribers
There are 556 unique mail addresses between both lists which is about 250
duplicate addresses.  Considering that until recently all new Traveller
development was New Era based, and about half of each list is on the other
list, TML is going to have a much higher content ratio as compared to Xboat.

but it was like "well let\'s re-invent traveller again and sell it to
a new audience", it was weak and hey life is about survival of the
fittest. So let\'s abandon TNE it was a shit idea, virus? do me a
favour (oh dear I\'ve put a U in it) combine the ideas of MT, the
rules from CT, throw in snapshot/striker rules for general combat,
then take it on a few years and establish a factionalised new system,
hey presto new system, naughty in one place good in another where you
can\'t get arrested.
If any of you TNE maggots don\'t like it well in the words of Denis
Leary; " shut the f*** up"

Well, time for some more of my change to go rattling around.  You
don\'t have to consider yourself hosed.  If you take FFS stats for
ships and just use their Battle Rider stats, you can take have a quick
reference for any ship that provides about as much detail as the old
USP\'s.  The only thing is keep the damage values consistent between BL
and BR (thus, you would list a weapon\'s damage as per BL/FFS instead
of converting it to BR).  This gives you a quick overview of the ship
that isn\'t too detailed, and provides all of the necessary information
for quick gameplay.

All too often I find people that hamstring themselves by the rules.
Sometimes you should just make it and leave it at that.  If the
deckplans and layout are more important, then concentrate on those.
Let everything else about the ship just magically happen.  I never
bother with this much detail unless I plan on doing some type of write
up about said ship or unless I\'m purposefully creating a ship (FFS is
a great way to spend a rainy day).

I always found MT and TNE combat to be rather "developed".  That\'s why
I propose a slimmer combat system with an advanced section that allows
you to add all of the other bells and whistles when you want.  For
now, I just strip it down to the most important things.  Move, fire,
duck.  If something is really crucial then we worry about it with all
the rules.  The problem isn\'t that there\'s too much data, it\'s just
that it hasn\'t been presented in either a parsimonious version or
digestible "chunks".

: in our Real Lives we don\'t want to think of a lot of these problems as well.

: four footed drool dog, will it no longer bother me.

Then don\'t worry about it!  Let the information be there for the
people that do want it or are interested.  Skip over it.  Just look at
the chart that says "Pen/Dam/Price".  It\'s all there in TNE just like
it was in MT.

: I want a game where the publisher is going to spend their creative energies
: providing a way cool place to adventure and not get caught in the

: Efate, what can I as a DM describe to them is there.

I agree!  However, there is no reason why we can\'t balance both.  If
you\'re worried about TMI (too much information) then what are you
going to do when your worldbook/rice paper has WBH stat\'s (and you
thought FFS was lumbering).

: I don\'t want to say "You are in Efate.  Its a world.  You cross the path of
: someone who doesn\'t like you.  A fight breaks out, you pull out your TL15
: Advanced Combat Rifle with APFSDSDU rounds and fire a burst of three rounds.

: and mistake your starburst symbol for a faction of the Church of the One
: True Way, and begin a fight.  You pull out your ACR with APFSDSDU rounds and
: fire.  You dropped a rebal and now can escape.

Then do that.  Quick example of combat around my part.

GM: "You\'ve travelled to Efate.  It\'s a world under political seige by the
Jhymkara Rebels.  As you\'re leaving the starport, they spot you and
mistake your starburst symbol for a faction of the Church of the One
True Way, and decide to fight."

Player: "I pull out my generic-big-gun and take a shot at them."

GM: "Roll for Average difficulty, if you hit, roll for some damage."

Player: "I hit him for 18."

GM: "You pop a cap in his ass and he\'s done for, move along. (just so you
know, this is the result I gave because it\'s what I wanted)"

I treat the rebel as a goon.  If their really irrelevent, then I don\'t
worry about armor or what their actual hits are, etc...  Sure, they
drop like Stormtroopers, but they serve no other value than to show
how dangerous this place is.  Only when the characters are major
villians or I need to provide a red herring do I ever worry about the
level of detail that you\'re complaining about.

Just my take on roleplaying style versus roleplaying rules.

about 20-25 % are Keep TNE
about 20 % are Revise and reprint MegaT
about 20% are revise and expand Classic
about 10% are reprint ct or mt as is (with erratta corrections only)
about 10% seem to ask for something new (GURPS Trav being the leader there)
some 5-10% want an amalgamated hybrid between mega and TNE.

Nobody seems to want to give up their "favorite setting"

Phil wants TL\'s overhauled.

Everyone wants traveller to survive somehow.

Overall, it seems that most of us don\'t use the RC, (I estimat about 30-40%
of TNE persons use it)

most agree that FF&S is too in depth, and has several broken features.

about 80% of those posting seem to want an FF&S lite for whatever the final
system ends up being.

about 5% of all responses seem to indicate that they will not buy a new edition.

The above are OBSERVATIONS ONLY, not a detailed statistical analysis.

Personally, I am in the Revise and rework MT, with some additions, and
pro-FF&S lite.

Actually, the Gulf War is a good example of economic superiority.  What do

I agree. I have played and run my share of Cyberpunk and  Shadowrun games
and have found that not only are the environments in these games
"Cyberpunk" but the games themselves are "Cyberpunk" - attitude and style.
OK it was great fun but move on already, the cliches are mounting and the
irony is wearing thin. Its about time the chrome and gloss was taken out of
the "dark future".

    'body' => 'Thanks everybody, for the interesting suggestions about what to do with =
game time in jump space.
It is very true that changing jump drive retroactively would cause major =
headaches for Traveller history and so on.  But there is a way to avoid =
that, if Mr Miller deems it a good idea, of course.
Our Founding Father lists several different time periods in which =
Traveller campaigns could be run.  I like this idea very much, because =
outside of rules disputes, it\'s a good idea for satisfying everybody\'s =
tastes, and it helps take care of the issue of some people\'s dislike of =
the Collapse and so on (I have a love-hate relationship with it myself - =
I find Virus very interesting, and I\'m a little glad the Imperuim\'s gone =
because it was too stable and big, and most adventures published were =
for a bunch of merchants or trade spies, which I personally am not so =
interested in, but I am saddened to see the avaliable tech level drop, =
and the setting started to remind me of Twilight 2000 or Gamma World, =
and damn this is long).
Anyway, I promise not to assault you with long parenthesized paragraphs =
anymore.   As I was saying, if we follow Mr. Miller\'s idea, we could =
have an alternate campaign setting set a few hundred years or whatever =
after the Collapse.   We would have new states, new technology (can we =
go to TL 17 or 18 now please?), perhaps new alien races and threats, and =
maybe a new type of FTL drive, improved jump drive, or whatever other =
aspect of Traveller technology we think needs supplementing.  TL 17 or =
18 is currently not so well defined (except for some design data in MT), =
so we would be able to make it what we wanted while avoiding the =
Ringworld dilemma about overly powerful technology in an RPG.  Even if =
we created a new FTL drive, conventional 1-week jump drive would still =
be available technology, and would be the only technology at TL 15 or =
below.  People fond of this technology wouldn\'t lose out.
If the project seems too big, then as Rob Miracle suggested in the last =
TML digest, we could all contribute a little bit in our area of =
expertise and interest to help flesh it out, with Mr. Miller having =
final say on what becomes official.  There seems to be a lot of people =
who enjoy writing background stuff or making technological devices at =
least as much or more than they like to play or referee.  (Armand states =
the obvious.) =20
This new setting could be something CT, MT, and TNE =
background-enthusiasts could compromise on, so that all three groups =
would be interested in it.  Again, as someone pointed out, playing in =
1110 or 1115 is nice, but you know the Rebellion and Virus will happen =
(and soon too because of week-long jumps), unless you ignore the =
canonized Traveller background.  Most of us are loathe to do that, =
right?
I guess I\'m in the Tweak TNE camp.  I don\'t want to lose all the =
information and knowledge contained in the current TNE rules, but I see =
a great need for better organization and streamlining for quick =
resolution of combat and so on during play.  I think the biggest time =
waster is not so much the rolls to hit, penetrate, and damage, but =
rather the time it takes to find out what exactly these rolls need to be =
and what the exact effects are.  This information is spread out and hard =
to find.  It\'s also hard to decipher most of the weapon charts during =
real-time play too, and to know which statistic to use when.  For =
example, the complications with laser penetration, or shotgun fire are =
not clearly laid out so that the rules can be executed quickly. =20
I don\'t want an oversimplification of the Traveller rules, as I think CT =
is.  Winging it is good, and referees should always do it when they want =
to, but you shouldn\'t be forced to do it because you can\'t figure =
something out that the rules cover vaguely or confusingly.  You wasted =
money on a book of useless information then.  You could just play =
without rules.  But what would that do to the people selling the rule =
books?  Poor GDW.
All for now.  I\'m interested in what you think about all this.
Armand
P.S.:  It seems that each line of my messages has an =3D sign at the end =

Windows 95.  Any idea why I produce the =3D signs?  And can you read =
