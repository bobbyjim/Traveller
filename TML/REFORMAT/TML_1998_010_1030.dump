Well, thank you for that. I can at least say I have chosen the proper
ship for my campaign this fall. Her interior design and equipment just
looked real good to me and she seemed to be the least formidable
looking  of ships to be re-entering the wilds from Regency boundaries.
But in using AA\'s design spreadsheet, she is coming out at about twice
the original cost (without discount) for a new ship at TL15. Does that
sound right for the 100+ year time difference. By the way, what is the
proper Imperial year corresponding to Terran 1998. Am I right that it
would be 1207.
The storyline that I intend to follow is that BT, who lost their
headquarters at Trin, re-organized on Mora to keep tabs on the other
Mega Corps. Following the limited opening of the Deneb borders, but not
wanting to submit to a one way only trip, high level BT liaison teams
went to work on RQS, RIIS, and other Regency agencies to pound out the
means by which they could pass both ways. The results were to have
\'special people\' from each group on board.(:  There\'s more but that is a
continuing story.

It would be nice if some kind person having access to plans with the
various major variations shown, or write ups on the same, would consider
passing them on privately. I know that Bilstein Yards in Glisten built
the original in cooperation with BT but plans from our western office
there must have been transferred to, and destroyed at Trin.

I have been looking in the information I have but can find no reference

Last dated message 312-1130 was from Sestao/Reft when the Deneb navy
closed their borders and wished all well. The last message to all TNS
data nodes was unidentified. I assume that that portions of the TNS and
a lot of TAS that was in what we now call the Regency still survives in
some form or other. If so, where would the headoffices of TAS and TNS
be. If not would it be feasible to have some character(s) reorganize it
following similar guide lines?
This could be for real as well. For those running campaigns in any era,
it would be nice if a TNS type bulletin was sent through the traveller
talk line for any major happening in your campaign. Then those
travelling in the same or nearby teritories could keep their games
current. This would be especially helpful if and when a new star system
is developed that hasn\'t shown up elsewhere.
Just a thought.

Could go either way in the thousand or so years of Imperial histroy. It may
also depend on the context - our Count above may be socially known as
\'Bubbles\', semi-formally known as Count XYZ (or just XYZ), and have the
full formal title above that no-one uses.

You may also have people like Marine Sergant Second Class Sir Joe
Mokalvski, Viscount Roushnet, who is of course known as \'Sargent Mokalvski\'
becuase that is a title he earned the hard way, rather than just by being a
third son of some noble.

Calling him \'Your Excellency\' or \'Vicount\' is a good way to get hit.

Or are even incoming, but too far away to attempt combat. Universal

Forcing the supply shuttles to convoy may not be that hard - after the
first few are lost they will probably do it voluntarily. Even then, it
gives the locals a much larger volume to patrol than just the 110 diameter
limit, plus a couple of \'approved jump points\'.

Completely agreed. Such independant miners will have an interesting
relationship with pirates - they will both be the commonest victims, and a
common market for stolen goods.

Depending on who his parents are, I kinda doubt he\'d be Viscount Roushnet.  
The heavier titles would pass on to the oldest kid in the 3I.  Most likely, 
he\'d just be a knight, or if he was in line for the title, he\'d most likely be 
an officer.  He wouldn\'t actually inherit the title until Mom/Dad kick off.

FWIR, yeah, all ships retain velocity & vector (referenced to galactic center) 
on exit.

Not impossible, just high risk.  It could also explain why merchant ships are
allowed to carry military-grade weapons.  In order to encourage the creation
and development of resources (that might not be located on the mainworld) the
Imperium could allow weapons to be carried so that traders can run the
gauntlet when trading in the outer systems.  Otherwise, there seems little
point in letting any merchant that can afford the weapon and required
powerplant/cargospace to have weapons.  Its just asking for trouble.  Why
would they need them if you never leave the heavily patrolled 100 diametre
regions of the respective mainworlds?

Subject: Pirates

Sculden, 

I haven\'t got much time to get this all down, I think they\'re on to 
me so I\'m having to get my thoughts together as I move. I only
hope that I can find a boat drop out here in the sticks so I can
download this file. 

You know that during my entire career of working on the III-Files
for the OCC I have never given up my hope of solving the 
problem of piracy in the Imperium. Where do they come from?
Where do they go? How do they support themselves in an
environment where the ships they use and the ships they rob
are often worth many times the cargos? Why, in an Empire
with so many Naval ships with nothing better to do than patrol,
is it still so common to run into them? If they--

[BREAK]

Sorry, had to duck out there for a little bit. They\'re closer on my
tail than I had thought. Anyway. I know that conventional wisdom
would have you believe that alien forces from outside our
borders are working at unknown purposes and are seizing
targets of opportunity as well as orchestrating paranoia and
fear, and that this accounts for the majority of pirate attacks,
with the desperate actions of a few sociopaths making up the
tiny percentage left over. This is what they want us to believe,
Sculden, the Truth is far more sinister and frightening. It\'s a
widely held belief that only state-sponsored raiding could 
support piracy in the numbers that it has historically existed
at. This is only half of the Truth, Sculden; we have been 
looking at the wrong State all this time -- it\'s our own Empire
doing this to us! Think back to the beginnings of the 3rd
Imperium and the way that the Zhunastu used Fear, Loathing,
and Doubt to conquer and then control the pocket empires 
and independent planets on the borders of Imperial Space
during the Great Expansion. It\'s always been a mystery why
Zhunastu Enterprises went under when they had such a 
successful and profitable run using their techniques to 
acchieve a near monopoly on the worlds brought into the
3I. I\'ve solved the mystery, Sculden, I see it all too clearly
now -- they never went under, they went underground! 
Ponder this: why would the core worlds and mains feel 
that they still needed the Imperial Navy skulking about, 
poking it\'s nose into their business if the enemies of the
Empire were a year\'s travel away? Why would they feel 
that they should still submit to high taxation their safe lanes
of travel to support a fleet protecting the borders sectors
away? The Zhunastu are still with us, Sculden, they have
become a secret force working at the Empire\'s behest to
harass the merchants and shippers of the core worlds; not
enough to come anywhere close to being a true threat to
trade, but just enough to cause Fear, Loathing, and Doubt
in the minds of the planetary governors, the citizens, and
the merchants to cause them to not only tolerate the 
presence of the Imperial Navy poking around, but to 
demand that they be there to "protect their trade fleets."
How else can piracy survive when so many pirates take
megacredits of damage to their ships? When so few 
cargos are actually taken? When so

[BREAK]

Sculden, I\'m on the move again. I\'m dropping this off in
the boat drop here and then setting off for the high port 
as fast as this air raft will take me. I think I saw the Anagathics
Man watching me from across the slideway a few minutes
ago. I\'ll contact you again when I can.

Going through the bulkheads will cost our pirate time, which they probably
wont have, assuming any forces at all in the system.

And I still think shooting captains who disable the computer system is a
viable tactic for pirates.

First of all, 250 MJ civilian lasers and kinetic kill or non-det laser
missiles do nasty things to smallish ships without 10cm plus of superdense.

Secondly, I think you underestimate the political pressure that the trade
and finance community will bring to bear on the appropriate local authorities.

Thirdly, personal defense forces include planetary and subsector navies,
which are usually seen as being outside the non-wartime IN chain of command.

This is balanced by Naval Intelligence realising the risk that a network of
pirate bases represent - what happens when an Enemy Power starts using
these to gather intelligence ?

This might result in some interesting bureaucratic warfare - IN
Intelligence quietly orginising \'private\' anti-piracy expiditions against
the official policy. After all, if the bureaucracy issuing the orders is a
year away, it will take them at least a year to find out, and at least a
year to countermand it. Then we get to query the countermand order, then we
get to fire some \'rogue subordinate\' etc etc .

This is going to be more pronounced with stealing non-jump ships in the

His chances of survival under these circumstances are actually about nil.
He\'ll be the first one shot when the captured ship arrives in the wrong place.

If you use a system of cut-out points (jump capture to point x, stick
navigator in low berth, jump ship to base y while the co-operating crew
members are taken to point z and released), then you can maintain the
security of your base with low extra expenses.

Fair enough. Saves you from having to get rid of the crew later.

  Forget disguising techniques, if you\'re a hardy career pirate then
how are the authorities seeing your vacc suit, or dropping by your
ship/base to ask to see your wardrobe?

  Let\'s concede all that. Isn\'t it safe to say that the authorities are
going to find detailed EMS signatures for a ship (of which how many exist
in said class?) compared to some _very_ unreliable eyewitness accounts of
gun-toting apes, of which several hundred _billion_ largely undifferentiated
units populate each sector of the Imperium?

  To use one of those horrible SE Asian waters analogies, do you really think
that "ship X was held up by ten short brown men with guns and knives, using a
boat" is really more helpful to anti-piracy efforts than "pirates used Y class
vessel (eliminate ones which movement records can account for) with the
following identifying characteristics (visual/structural/acoustic in RL vs
EMS in OTU)"?

  Frankly, between taking the ship and _not_ killing awkward prisoners,
I\'d probably take the ship, and I\'ll guess that most pirates would too.

  Most carjacking devices aren\'t installed on hundred-million dollar
panel trucks. Presumably pirates searching a ship have the same time

  I\'m going to assume that for ID\'ing a ship that camera/sensor recordings
are vastly more useful than sapients seeing the ship or boarders. Does that
sound reasonable?

  The authorities may base rewards on the _pirates_ ship.

  Historically, I believe it\'s mostly installing and checking all the
systems inside the hull. You can send a cruiser hull down the slipway
in pretty short order, but then you have to install a working ship
inside it :)

  No idea if that\'s it in OTU, but TCS sort of implies it.

  Yeah, the two have similar but different problems. I think that
Mr. Smiths exploration of preying on intrasystem (non-Jump?) traffic
will help a lot with figuring out possibilities for both limited
specialty piracy and "casuals" (one-shot opportunists). I didn\'t see
any problems with it, although I\'d prefer that any that might exist
do get pointed out.

be a terribly bright idea :)

Like Duke of Normandy and Duke of Aquitane. The English Kings up until the

I read somewhere that chiildren in medieval (or later aristocratic) Europe
used to end up with ranks about two steps below their parents, at least
until the parnets died and their full titles past down.

In TNE you can get a TL-11 laser pack for the modular cutter. It doesn\'t
have on board sensors, but has its own power. If the cutter played it cool
until the pirate was alongside the pirate is going to get rather hurt. IMO
this could act as a significant deterent, because any cutter could be the
one carrying the pack.

	canon states that subsidaries are part of the reserve fleet, 
	and subject to mobilisation in terms of war. For this reason
	any subsidary trader has to be designed to for armament refit.
	IMTU nobles often pay for the armament, just to show their
	status. In the early 3I nobles also gave a letter of marque
	to use the e.g. against Vargr and Lancian vessels. This was
	of course not only noble, but a neccessarity.

	To Cite myself from the last THUDDD:

	" Reconfiguration with a AEMS, fire control or even a jammer are
	always possible.  Power supply and data links are already prepared. "

	" On a first look a cargo bay can be nothing special, if you
	assume this, we could prove you wrong. As told the Kebra Nagast
	is primary a Liner, but of course its secondary subject to fleet
	mobilization. The cargo bay has a length of 40 meter and is
	divided into two parts. Those are arranged together with the
	empty turret socket that a 3,6m*40m particle accelerator fits
	in. The backward part would than contain a second power plant, a
	missile bay and fire control bridge together with sensors and
	jammer. As the complete backward bay is a multi mission pod, the
	reconfiguration is a matter of 30 minutes on any shipyard where
	graph technology is available. This would reduce the cargo
	capacity to 148 dt. Two small hangars able to host a ships boat,
	a gig or a fighter, are arranged with the forward cargo bay so
	that its possible to store 8 additional fighters in two decks,
	if you want to be able to maintain and repair them, and still
	have some room for cargo. "

	" Kebra Nagast is the Indian Book of Death, and as Dover Gabe
	will run the supplies with high armament, and less cargo, we are
	waiting for the first Vargr pirate trying to open it. Once the
	ship has its name of being a difficult prey, Dover Gabe will mix
	high armed and high cargo ships at random. We would advise the
	IMTD to finance additional vessels, as this would make the Vland
	area more secure. "

	Having two ships looking identical, one with a 1080Mj PA,
	two fast missile autolaunchers, AEMS/Jammer, 3 FireControls,
	and the other just a fat merchant. Would make living as a
	pirate much more interesting - Of course the Krebra Nagast
	not only makes a good fleet transport, it would also be
	a good pirate with its ability to host fighters. IMTU "real"
	pirates dont operate from a ship, they use boat\'s, pocket
	rockets (graphbikes) and even thruster packs. Its much to
	expensive to risk a ship. The merchant could be armed !

	Back to TNE - The class of ship is part of the Silkku
	(archipelago term for peoples army) build on Usdiki.

As I have stated before, I really don\'t think pirates are going
to be operating from bases.  It just won\'t take that long
for the Imperium to notice the activity is all in one area
and track them down.  They are going to be, IMO, passing as
legit traffic the rest of the tim.

Well, you have simply assumed that the Imerium has detailed EMS
signatures (from where I don\'t know) and that they will only
ever get vague descriptions of "gun-toting apes".

Well, if you don\'t take the crew then maybe nobody has to ge
captured or killed.

And I\'ll disagree.

And now we are into thowing back and forth plans and counter plans.
See my other post on the subject.  I could point out that the
pirates then demand the missing memory module or they will kill
the crew after all.  And then you come up with another plan
to make sure the pirates have to take the whole ship, etc.
It won\'t really prove which is more likely, just who was better
at dreaming up schemes.

To do this right, I should be pointing out that is it quite possible
that the crew could disable the drive and it simply might not
be possible to take the ship.

Sure, but the cost of the these devices is also trivial.  The
fact is that their value is nothing compared to a car.  If you
think that being cheap compared to what you are guarding is
sufficient reason to assume it exists, then you have to ask
why every car doesn\'t have such a system.

OTOH, if you assume that it also depends on the odds that it will
be needed (which matches better with realitiy), then it is
quite reasonable that a ship isn\'t going to have repeaters and
dozens of other things to catch pirates.  (more so because,
again, the value to the ship owner of simply getting the pirate
caught later one is much less than a preventative measure.)

No.  It sounds like you are assuming your arguements are right.

And they may base it on the fact that if you take the ship
then you have the value of _two_ ships and that is further
upped by the fact that murder was involved.

Norris Aella Aledon, Archduke of Deneb, Duke of Regina, Count
Aledon, Baron Yori.  I\'m not sure if there was a Marquisate in
there anywhere.

In Arrival Vengeance, when the protagonists get to Usdiki, in
"Strephon\'s Imperium", the man that places Avery into their
custody is clearly the Emperor, but throughout their visit, the
protagonists are expected to address him as befits the Marquis of
Usdiki, which is how they are presented to him.

Challenge #69 was the issue in which the Spinward Marches "filled the
moat and manned the walls", so to speak. Challenge #70\'s TNS was nothing
but garbage to simulate the effects of Virus. Challenge #71\'s TNS was
mainly garbage but ended with some characters finally breaking through
the garbage and bringing up the lights of a city (nicely done, I 
thought).

Challenge #72 is the first issue to list the Coalition Information
Network.

I\'d say there would be a sector office at each sector capital,
subsector offices at each subsector capital, and field offices at
most of the worlds with Class A/B starports and large populations.

    'body' => '(with apologies to all involved<g>)

Long considered as more eccentric members of the Office of 
Calendar Compliance, Muldoon and Sculden have been recog-
nized by their superiors as having that particular combination of
talent and chemistry needed to make a productive and efficient
team. Their penchant for solving the bizarre and unsolvable 
quickly caught the attention of the directors of The Ephemeris,
the covert intelligence gathering branch of the OCC, and they
were quickly brought into the ranks. 

Francis "The Fox" Muldoon 7A9CC9

Female Human, Age 33, Agent 3rd year of 3rd term, Rank E5
BS in Psionicology, Honors
Investigation 3, Computer 2, Fast Talk 2, Gun Cbt(Pistol) 2,
Perception 2, Research 2, Streetwise 2, Grav Craft 1, Ground
Craft 1, Jack O T 1, Language(Newt) 1, Law 1, Psionicology 1,
Psychology 1, Stealth 1, Vacc Suit 1

Muldoon, known as "The Fox" to her friends, joined up as an
agent of the OCC straight out of college. Always interested in
the paranormal and the unexplained (ever since her pet cat
Sammy disappeared during a Vargr raid on her homeworld),
she had not been in the Office long before being approached
by members of The Ephemeris. It was there that she discovered
the existence of the III-Files, a long neglected collection of
data crystals detailling unsolved and paranormal occurances
occurring in the 3I; it is due to her reputation for getting her
"normal" assignments done in record time that she is allowed
to spend her spare time working on them. Known as some-
thing of a loose cannon, she was assigned Sculden as a 
partner to try to overcome some of her more outlandish ten-
dencies. She has long believed that she has latent psionic
powers but has never been able to contact a reputable 
institute for long enough to find out for sure. Even if she does
not, her quick mind, incredible charisma, and unbelievable 
luck fills in to give much the same effect.

"Danny" Sculden 657CFA

Male Newt, Age 32, Scholar 3rd year of 2nd term
BS in Forensics, Honors
MD, Honors
Medical 4, Administration 3, Research 3, Computer 2, 
Forensics 2, Ground Craft 2, Language(Ganglic)2, Law 2,
Biology 1, Chemistry 1, Diplomacy 1, Grav Craft 1, Gun
Cbt(Pistol) 1, Instruction 1, Investigation 1, Perception 1,
Psychology 1 

Danny Sculden\'s actual name is Kwabalande-bapdandandan/
Sk-ldenwapes-enamane. Shortened for dealing with Imperials,
his Office name is Sk-lden or Sculden. His close friends call
him Danny after the -dan repetition of his first name part. 
Working as a forensic investigator for the Office, he was 
assigned to Muldoon as a partner because of a) he is un-
usually adventurous and inquisitive for a Newt, and b) this
still leaves him so conservative that he is seen as a moderating
influence over The Fox\'s more outlandish activities. While 
often as exacerbated by Muldoon\'s antics as his superiors
in The Ephemeris, Danny must admit that The Fox has an in-
credibly amount of luck in cutting straight to the chase, he
just hopes that he is not around when her luck runs out. 
Although very outgoing and curious for a Newt, Sculden
feels that Muldoon is often "Pawa-bawabawaba-kwenana-
a-emanbapbap" or "hanging by a leaf of the tiniest branch
of the great tree" as far as her theories and explanations are
concerned, even after Muldoon has been proven correct 
almost every time.

The Anagathics Man ??????

Male Human, Age Unknown (appears late 50s)

The sometimes-nemesis of Sculden and Muldoon, the 
Anagathics Man is a mystery even The Fox has not been 
able to crack yet. Often seen fleetingly by the duo, he seems
to have taken a curious interest in the path of their career. 
Remarkably, he or someone quite like him has been seen
or (vary rarely) recorded at the scene of many of the 3I\'s
more momentous events over the last few centuries. Muldoon
has a theory that he may in fact have been one of the original
high ranking officials of the Zhunastu and a close associate of
Cleon I, though this theory is not believed by anyone else.

Muldoon,

I\'ve found some very old records, dating back to the last days of the
Sylean Federation.

They refer to a group known as the \'Friends of Cleon\', and a technique of
seeding pirates within a system, in order to create a demand for the
Imperial Fleet to protect them.

I find it almost impossible to believe that such a conspiracy could have
lasted this long. I think I shall have to make the trip to the AAB on Vland
- - the records of the negotiations between Cleon Zhunatsu and the Bureaux
should still be there. If such a technique existed, then it must have been
discussed in those negotiations.

There is a second line of enquiry, Muldoon, and the implications scare me.
As you know, the IISS has two basic divisions - Administration, and the
Field Service. Ananlysis of IISS records indicate many members of the Scout
service have formal training in commodities brokerage. I would expect these
persons to be concentrated in the Purchasing units of the Administration,
yet many of them are in the Field.

Muldoon, can our own Empire be not only supporting Piracy, but training
Pirates in the techniques to profitably fence stolen goods ?

I would agree with your summation of where offices would likely be
located. I feel that there would have been most of that in place in the
Regency from before. Couple that with the probable amount of Cr that had
accumulated and not been transferred to HO, there should have been
enough to re-start or startup an R-TAS. If no other\'s have taken up the
cause then I guess I can create at will. There would certainly be a
number of the financially able, corp\'s/mega-corps and some sponsored
chaps who could benefit from such an organization not to mention those
who had belonged and were now out of it. My guess is that it would be
one of them that grab the bull by the horns so to speak.

  As a starship equipped pirate, I\'ll just send across a boat full of apes.

  OTOH, having a honking big det-laser array deploy inside a ballistic cargo

  Apparently in Spanish colonial America there was a formula that a viceroy
could apply to an order from the peninsula - (trans.) "I obey but do not
implement". IIRC, they automatically faced reviews of their performance
afterwards, so they had to be restrained and responsible.

And I still think that if the target was jump-capable, it would have jumped
to escape your attack in the first place. And the computer could
probably be scrambled by the Captain, Command Pilot, Navigator,
Chief Engineer, Owner Aboard, or even the Chief Purser (who may be
the senior company representative on board, and is often in charge of
security anyway). Which one do you shoot? The company will probably
(quietly) commend the guy who got the Captain shot but saved their

For "personal" I should have used "private" - owned and commanded

I would agree that planetary navies are outside the non-wartime IN 
chain of command, but I don\'t see the Imperium allowing autonomous
(or even semi-autonomous) interstellar warfleets within their borders.
Too tempting for those recently-conquered provinces to take those
warfleets and declare themselves independent again, no? Note that
I\'m talking "recent" from a conservative Vilani point of view here.

I see subsector and sector navies as being the colonial fleets that are
based, supported and tasked to the areas they are native to, while
the IN rotates regular fleets through as meets their grand strategy - 
both, however, will be answerable to the same overall chain of
command at all times, though they may have different roles.
If the Imperial Admiral in charge of the sector berates the subsector
admiral for chasing pirates when he should be watching the Zhodani,
the anti-piracy campaign will go away (or at least become more
discreet).

That\'s why Merchants can get Bribery skill. :) And the Merchants
will probably have more money to bribe people with than the Pirates
will.

Maybe the Merchants will just cut out the middle man (Navy) and bribe
the Pirates. "Here\'s a megacredit, please leave us alone."

"Here\'s two megacredits. Could you go after this guy\'s ship instead?"

"Here\'s the empty hold of my ship. You wouldn\'t happen to know
anyone who can\'t get to a legal starport and needs to sell a big

Ian again:

This is balanced by Naval Intelligence realising the risk that a network of
pirate bases represent - what happens when an Enemy Power starts using
these to gather intelligence ?

This might result in some interesting bureaucratic warfare - IN
Intelligence quietly orginising \'private\' anti-piracy expiditions against
the official policy. After all, if the bureaucracy issuing the orders is a
year away, it will take them at least a year to find out, and at least a
year to countermand it. Then we get to query the countermand order, then we

ordered by the Vatican to investigate him for Heresy (and probably
execute or at least ruin him). By the time the orders made the trip
from the Vatican to the depths of Poland, the holy man\'s situation had
changed so much he had to send another message back asking for
more instructions. The Priest even got to the point where he wrote 
a letter to his superior in Rome, was promoted to that superior\'s position
while the letter was in transit - his own letter got forwarded back to
him in Poland (since he now held the Office the letter was addressed to),
and he had to answer his own question - of course, by writing the 
Vatican for even more instructions. I will completely agree that someone
who wants to take advantage of a long communications lag to show 
some "personal initiative" can do so.

Heck, the Regina sector head of IN Intelligence will probably retire before
an inspector from Core comes out to see what he did with all those
Light Cruisers... :)

His chances of survival under these circumstances are actually about nil.
He\'ll be the first one shot when the captured ship arrives in the wrong place.

To what gain? Shooting him isn\'t going to put enough hydrogen in 
your tanks to get away from the patrol cruisers. To set an example
for other merchants? That only works if you get to play pirate again - 
the only person you\'ll make an impression on by shooting the 
Navigator is the local IMoJ Magistrate when he\'s deciding whether to
transport you to a penal colony or have you executed to set an
example for other Pirates.

If the prize crew is bloodthirsty or fanatical (or just plain stupid), you\'ve
got a different story - but in these cases the Navigator\'s life was
probably forfeit anyway.

Nastier idea - some people have mentioned unmanned supply shuttles
as pirate targets. What if the owners rig a couple of these to explode
if tampered with or sent a code by a patrol ship? Much worse for
the pirate than the laser pack will be, especially if the 71-ton bomb
in the shuttle goes off in the pirate\'s cargo bay. Enough of the things
a mining colony would need (explosives, fuels, oxygen) make good
bomb parts anyway.

Of course, the shuttle bomb idea would only be used if pirates have
been really racking up the shuttles lately. If the locals are considering
these, the pirate has overstayed his welcome and needs to find some
new hunting grounds - which any pirate should do on a regular basis as
a matter of course.

  OK. Equally, though, some see it being harder to operate within even
a basically regulated ship movement system than it is simply to avoid
the system completely by operating from a base and hitting intra-system
traffic.

  Actually, I\'m assuming that the Imperium doesn\'t have EMS data filed,
but will start looking for matching profiles once they\'ve got a report.
Even if they get a good description of a person, how could they possibly
match it up given the number of (undocumented) people on the spaceways?

  Sort of. But it points out that pirates have effectively no control over
what useful evidence they leave behind on a ship. While it may not be likely
(say 25%, for ex.) that major EMS data is left behind, a single occurrence
may make further "legit" operations impractical, and they may not know until
too late.

  Additionally, the ship itself is proof positive that a piracy occurred.
Taking (or hiding) the ship leaves the possibility open of a misjump or
other accident, hijacking, skipping bank payments, or at least question
as to precisely where the ship went missing.

  A good point. If I were the pirate - and from the economic analyses
that I\'ve seen, it\'s worth killing everyone on board to get them to
fix it just so you can have the ship to sell. PC\'s, OTOH, might do this
as a matter of course :)

  Actually, in loss-prevention/insurance there are additional concepts;
simply, a small truck isn\'t a large enough (absolute, not relative) value
to get really excited over, where the loss of MCr 50-100 requires a lot
more effort by responsible personnel.

  Oddly, ships have anti-hijack programs... Again, a simple review
will indicate that even small chances of a screw-up (random search,
EMS sig, patrol encounter) on an individual sortie have horrible
results for career survivability. You don\'t have to be targetting
Swheinfurt for a 50-mission assignment to be suicide. The problem 
with career piracy of Traveller starship cargos is that the value
of current loads isn\'t enough to allow a fortune to be made before
the odds catch up with the typical pirate.

  A data module is the size of a small car, in keeping with the `50\'s idea?

  Interesting. Why is a (unreliable) visual report of a suited boarder or
ship typically more useful than the same or greater info recorded by more
reliable and capable sensor systems?

  You know, it\'s _very_ difficult to discuss what\'s wrong (or right)

technical analysis is "I disagree".

  Amusingly enough "ideology" is a neutral term, even in California AFAIK.
As for bizarre, yes. If I want to discuss Technocracy or Social Credit then
it\'s probably fair to accept the label for them, as they\'re not widely
practiced or tested. I did ask for any examples of the systematic application
of the principle you\'re relying on, and provided several counter-examples
of my own. OC, you snipped all but the Green River item, answered somewhat
out of context, and ignored it further. For further examples, neither state
vs private medicine, or socialism vs. Thatcherism, OTOH, can credibly be
considered to include bizarre elements, merely subjective ones.

  As for the merit of my posts, I\'m content to let them stand for themselves,
and to answer any questions that arise.

  True. However, if a 100-D station is economically quite viable,
then (as you argue above) then _a_ station will exist where traffic
warrants whether it supplies fuel or not. If someone then builds a
fuel tank (provably quite economical and profitable) they might as
well park it nearby, placing it within the first stations presumed
defensive envelope. OC, neither might be armed, but it seems odd if
they are more expensive than a small trader.

  The problem here is that the first wave of an invasion will probably
decapitate the system, without the somewhat problematic additional
fleets of Navy tankers. How do enemy and friendly ships identify 
themselves to the hiding tanker (which without thruster plates needs
days to hide - if an enemy intel source is active then it _can\'t_)
when even in peacetime ID is essentially verbal and unconfirmed?

  Also, ships can get killed quite handily looking for or trying to reach
a hiding station (aka "tanker"?), and can\'t jump to escape while doing
so. BTW, how does one locate a hiding station?

  However, no serious refutation was offered as to why those existing
ships wouldn\'t be available (though not necessarily used) in peacetime.

  Basically I look at the evidence and conclude that a reasonable effort
to restrict piracy will make career piracy (of starships or their cargo)
nonviable/suicide. Casual piracy still looks do-able (and provides most
of the risk desired to meet the feel of CT). Preying on intra-system traffic
looks good, the more so with the recent explorations of it. OC, truly
exceptional circumstances and foreign privateers/raiders also stand.

  Sorry, quantity/cost, not individual size. However, the fuel requirements
for certain High-pop systems are going to be truly staggering; such that
failure to install a TankerRon equivalent will reduce shipping capacity.
Even Jae Tellona, as reported recently, could have (varies by model) a weekly
throughput of ~4 million D-tons of shipping. Depending on fuel throughputs
that could require a several hundred thousand Dt fleet tamker on its own,
for a pop 5 world!

  Luckily, I\'ve got this stuff filed. Your first case was drop tanks, which
was not an issue as we decided to discuss stations instead after Hans kicked
you out of his threads. The fuel stations (w or w/o J-drives?!) were next,
and tankers were last. So arguably, fuel thingies with jump thingies were
your second, third, or fourth, depending on how you count. You can check the
archives from 04-29 to 05-03 to confirm; please do so yourself in future if
you\'re going to state it as fact ("IIRC" is fine by me), as I\'ve little time
to do your research for you. If you\'ve had more recent ideas that you\'ve
thought through I\'d be genuinely interested in discussing them. 

  If I\'ve got the chronology wrong, please correct me.

  As for the last, I can well believe that.

...
>Yeah, except that jump stations don\'t need to be static.

  Thruster plates at 0.2-0.5 G (SWAG) are the minimum to hope for operational
survivability. Truly strategic survivability would require starship performance
that would make auxiliary TankerRon status a modest upgrade (by HG).

  BTW, does anyone have the J-#\'s for FFW IN tankers?

  I suggested (to refresh your memory) that the strategic liabilities could
have delayed implementation until after the rebellion started. The IN would
be drastically unhappy about that, whether they could do anything about it
or not.

  However, especially as the 3I is not an interventionist unitary state
(e.g. France), it doesn\'t follow that shippers would care about the long
term risk to the state (& its\' member worlds) enough to cough up the 
capital to Mil-spec the fuelling system, or be forced to do so without a
political struggle of near-epic proportions. You state that the two are
directly linked; can you provide further evidence/explanation?

  There\'s that word again. Strange. I don\'t think that it\'s possible
to eliminate piracy completely (e.g., however rare I think that the
crew of a patrol vessel mutinying might be, it could, and in the 3I,
_must_ happen occasionally)

  Could you just tick off the ones that you do consider viable, and
likewise for the not possible/practical? Which one(s) do you consider
to be too expensive to implement, or at least sufficiently so as to
be marginal?

  Sorry, habit. It saves a lot of trouble in discussing history,
economics, or poli-sci, in my experience. The point in that case
was that if inspecting ships at ports isn\'t "very" expensive then
expense isn\'t a genuinely compelling argument.

  Didn\'t you specify that tracking individuals (e.g., passengers)
was something that you disagreed with. Ditto for cross-checking
reported ship movements for anomalies? Stating the (IYTU) lack of
patrol vessels in many systems regardless of demonstrations about
the number of extant units? 

  Didn\'t your response to transponders (literally tamperproof or
not) very nearly amounted to the honour system by radio?

  I have to wonder about a security regime where a pirate is more
concerned about having his vacc suit rather than his ship ID\'d.

  Ships at ports aren\'t being delayed, and the cost of inspectors
does seem like a reasonable administrative role. Ships being stopped
at random should be pretty minor overall, particularly if restricted
to smaller, mostly tramp, vessels (assuming that large corps will have
a variety of incentives to police themselves).

entry registry system throughout the Imperium?

>b) The same proceedure you cite to bypass the frontier could
>be used to bypass the inspections you are putting your faith in.

i) Most inspections would take place at ports. To avoid these a
ship must avoid ports; not an option for merchants running the
occasional scam, or someone trying to get a stolen ship to the
frontier.

ii) The inspections in question are to deal with long-term internal
problems. If a ship has (for ex) a 1% chance of being searched on
a pass-through, then a terrorist delivering a bomb (or corsair
delivering a raider party, or an unlicensed pilot violating some
shipping reg) is very unlikely to be caught.

  However, an enemy intelligence ship, or a smuggler importing nuclear
missiles for the well-dressed pirate, may have to make dozens of jumps
on their journeys. At this point even very small chances of being
stopped and searched become quite significant sources of risk.

I suspect it\'s not background radiation if it\'s current standard information;
modern radars are limited by receiver noise, not background radiation. This
probably means that for a given receiver temperature you get less noise for
shorter wavelengths, so I\'m still not sure why sensitivity would go up at
longer wavelengths. Could you dig up a reference? In any event, a scaling
law from radar won\'t extrapolate well to LIDARs...

  Piracy _would continue_ at some (reduced) rate. The original
post was meant to attract attention to the piracy implications
of the jump-station debate by way of a joke. That\'s why the
subject header changed way back from "NEWS FLASH...".

  I\'m not sure either way, and this one may vary greatly by campaign.
IIRC, Mr. Miller posted a T4.1 section a while back and there was a
deal of gnashing of teeth over the implications. Would it be best to
leave this unaddressed, with the statement that greater distance from
the "jump-station(/planet)" makes for greater piracy opportunities?

  I was being facetious, but it seems highly unlikely that someone
(whether Navy, COACC, customs/immigration, shipping lines, insurance
company staff, other 3I office [?]) won\'t keep detailed lists of at
least crew; see the April (?) thread about replacing (or not) lost crew
at short notice with unknown quantities. The MT adventure (A:V?) where
a pirate gang tries to acquire ships by reporting them stolen (via a
tap into the x-boat net) and then showing up as repo men is a great
example. Admittedly it works better in the Rebellion, as a jump or
three puts them into the Wilds, whereas in 1115 they\'ve got to hide/
chop/race to the frontier once the Navy catches on to the theft.

  And if we\'re going to take things to their natural conclusions as
you suggest - and with which I agree - then wouldn\'t the absence of
meaningfully reliable passenger manifests make kidnapping or slavery
a genuinely profitable sideline?

...

  It might be helpfully pointed out that accepting the thesis that
no one in the Imperium faces a requirement to maintain reliable
personnel rosters ends the debate by conceding that hijacking is
easy, which it would be under that regulatory regime. As for the
other, you have your own style, which I\'ve politely complained to
you about before.

TNS was folded into/superceded by SMART (MTJ 1-4). Smart is the library and
news service of the Regency, at least as early as 1121.

Anyone know where I can get a copy of Vilani & Vargr?  I just really need the
Vilani stuff unless the Vargr stuff is substantially different from the Vargr Alien
Module.

And is there anyway to tell someone is Vilani just by looking at them?

If they also have the description of the ship and what the crew
obeserved about it before they were taken, they have a real
start.  Then, if they catch them, they have that much more
evidence.

But it doesn\'t.  Any evidence collection scheme that is widely used
will be known to the pirates and they will have a chance to come
up with counter measures (which was the point of my other post).

Which means the crime isn\'t totally without risk.  We already knew
that since not every ship in the Imperium gets seized.  Piracy
will indeed by a risky business.

Yeah, my point is that there are incentives both ways.  Yes
a ship is worth a lot.  However, pirates who take the ship
re going to be much higher priorities for law enforcement.
Different pirates will be willing to take different risks
and different situations will produce different amounts
of risk.  (For example, does the Imperium see all pirates
as the same?  Or do they concentrate on those who take whole
ships and kill people, leaving the others as an after thought?)

Well, car insurance is a big industry.  Big enough a scale for the
reasoning you mention to take hold.  For the individualy the
lesser cost of the car is ofset by the lesser cost of the
system (and a car is still a major investment).  Also, so
my example of home security systems in my other post.

Yes, they have _some_ security.  They already have computer
so they stick some software on it.  The point is that you
simply can\'t suppose that every measure you can think of
will exist and hope to be realistic.

Well, most criminal who stick with crime do get caught.  That
is realsitic.

>You don\'t have to be targetting
>Swheinfurt for a 50-mission assignment to be suicide.

No, the odds are that you will get caught.  Though you probably,
like most criminals, don\'t _plan_ a 50 crime career.  You
plan to take one cargo at a time and your greed keeps
you pushing your luck.  As my uncle who is an FBI agent
says, that is who criminals get caught, they are by nature
greedy and they push their luck.

To put it another way, if you are postulating a crime that
exists, but is not rampant, there has to be _some_ risk.
Otherwise every Tom, Dick, and Harry who has access to an
armed ship will turn to piracy.

Again, you are simply assuming that all visual reports are unreliable.
Also, I am assuming that _both_ are useful.

Hogwash again.  First of all, you are being inconsitent.  You claim
I require narrow economic analysis and then that I won\'t get into
any analysis.

I have explained why I disagree, except for instances
where I have already explained it, over and over, in threads
that have been beaten to death and we already know where every
one stands and those instances where we have discussed things to the
point that it has been shown that the only disagreement is what kind
of society we see the Imerium to be.  (and event then we have
discussed why we see things that way).  If I was just saying "I disagree"
these posts would be a _lot_ shorter.

If you are claiming that you are somehow giving reasons while I am
just say "not so", I\'ll say again, Hogwash.  I remind you that
you are the one who used the terms "bizzare" and "exceedingly narrow".

I have not answered things that a) have been beaten to death, and
b) I don\'t care about anymore.  If I let you get the last word on those
and rested on what I said before, I see nothing wrong with that.
Nor have you been adverse to dropping points for whatever reason.

 I have had to do numerous times.

Sure.  But, one last time, if the situation become one where those
stations are untenable, one is not going to decide not building
fueling stations because you can\'t also build a trade station.
So explaining why the trade staions might not exist doesn\'t
explain why the fueling station don\'t exist.

Well, as I pointed out a while back, if commerce raiding also
entailed bombardment of the system, it seems odd that it was
refered to as raiding "commerce" and not attacking the whole system.
I also pointed out that you can indeed have a fleet that
can attack ships jumping in and out without having enough
firepower to get back such planetary defenses as deep meson
sites.

What do you mean, "even in peacetime"?  Are you saying that

be done even though the presence of convoys means that you
can ID a whole fleet of ships together rather than having
do do them one at a time?  And don\'t you think the presence
of enemy fleets moving around and attacking ships would make
people willing to do things they wouldn\'t do in peacetime?

The station can either come out to them (if you simply put
a maneuver drive on it) or tell them where he is.

And from where I stand sufficient refutation was indeed offered and
no serious counter arguement was offered.

God these "nothing you said was worthwhile" exchanges are wearysome!

What do people think the other person is going to respond
with?  "Gee, your right"???  And why, just because someone
doesn\'t waste time saying the same things one said last time,
all over again, do some people feel that means they should attack
the other in general terms.  Can\'t they just agree that it has already
been discussed and agree to disagree rather than going on
pointlessly recapping positions that everyone already knows?

It was when I was dealing with another person who felt that if
he couldn\'t support his positions with reasons, then he should
attack the other person.  I wasn\'t the only one who had problems
with his tatics.

Here, running flamewars seems to be what
you consider to be _your_ domain.  I won\'t intrude on your
domain.  Personal attacks is where I draw the line.  That was how
I ended it over there.  You can get the last word in and use the
opportunity to talk about how right you think you were.

If the cargo is live or valuable, intrasystem transfer will be by jump-0. 
 12% of the ship devoted to jump and j-fuel is certainly less than the

Take another look at the cost of jump drives. Prices like that probably
mean production can\'t keep up with demand. There\'s so much demand
from the interstellar trade and military markets that there isn\'t any
jump drive production capacity left over for intra-system craft, IMO.
Even if the production is there, the price of jump drives makes
conventional drives more than competitive on the intra-system runs.
Not to mention that a mishap with your maneuver drives means you
call for the patrol cutter for a tow; mishap with jump-0 drives might mean
you have to find your way back from out past Arcturus somewhere. :)

Day is IIRC, somewhat arbitrary, depends on moons, tidal locks, etc, but
for the most part, pick what you want.

Month isn\'t an astronomical unit, but if you want to, you can define it for
a particular planet based on a satellite.

Year can be basically done with Kepler\'s Third Law (by way of Newton):
          Kepler’s 3rd Law --> (m1+m2)P^2 = a^3
	 a in (AU), P in (yr), m in (Msun) 

Solving for P:  P= SQRT( a^3/(m1+m2)) 
If your sun is big enough, you can disregard the mass of the planet.  ditto
with the mass of the 2nd body in the gravity equation below.

Gravity is Gm1m2/d^2 (G is the gravitational constant 6.672 59 × 10-11 m3
kg-1 s-2 )

Oh, you bet.  I\'d wager that governments would have standing
reward offers for information on piratical operations, whether
or not the particular operation or person is already known to
the authorities.  I believe the US government does something
similar regarding terrorist threats.

Also, I would suspect that in addition to money, the Imperium
is ready to give leniency and money to the *first* member of
a pirate operation to squeal -- a\'la Sammy Gravano turning in
John Gotti (a former Mafia don in the New York area, for those
not up on American criminal goings-on).  He did some prison
time, but a pittance compared to his crimes, and wrote a book...

Furthermore, the insurance companies are going to have something
similar in terms of a reward program, and a hell of a private
intelligence network and database devoted to piracy suppression.

All this is of course grist for the mill.

The Hapless Adventurers take a simple delivery contract: goods to be
shipped two jumps away to a major trading hub.  The contract, secretly
arranged by a major campaign villain, is a set-up.

The MCV takes a faster ship and overjumps them to the hub, where he starts
spreading it around that the HAs are wanted criminals, with a price on
their heads on several worlds, two major insurance combines, and a rival
pirate leader.  Their ship is a skipped far-trader belonging to a
trade-combine known to reward people who return their property, no matter
how they got it back, and a criminal syndicate is offering a bounty on each
of them.  All of this goes through highly-unofficial channels only, so they
get into port fine.

The fireworks begin when the types of people who scann the arrival boards
see their ship name.

I\'d probably have them lose the ship and be on the run on a planet where
everyone thinks they\'re dangerous space-criminals.

In fact, I think that\'s what I will do.  Now I just have to decide who\'s
going to set them up for this...

Since it travels at the speed of light this is not an option.

Tavchedle\' is more properly the guys who take care of mental hygenics in the 
Consulate.  Only time you\'ll see them outside of the Consulate is when the 
Zhodani take over a new planet.

It\'s also inexact. The idea that Steven, Ian, and I have been trying to
get across is that if something becomes so expensive that you can\'t turn
a profit doing it, it may be presumed to whither and die. Always assuming
there are no other reasons than profit for performing the activity.

Yet there are historical criminal activities that have completely disappeared
in certain specific areas of the world. I believe that mugging is way down
inside police stations, for example. (This isn\'t quite as facecious as it
may appear; one the main parts of my belief is based on the fact that the
amount of space that needs to be patrolled is effectively very small and just
happens to be where patrol ships are based). We\'ve talked about modern day
piracy before. That issue is confused by the fact that any kind of attack on
a ship is technically speaking piracy (one example I found in the excellent
references Thom provided was pirates using trucks and .45 revolvers to attack
riverboats). The kind of piracy I _still_ claim I haven\'t heard of lately is
people getting hold of a gun-mounted vessel and hunting down prey on the high
sea. But let me turn away from pure piracy and provide a better example. When
was the last time you heard of someone sacking a city in the Carribean? You
know, the favorite passtime of the English buccaneers, collecting a fleet of
ships, sailing to some Spanish port, defeating the local garrison and holding
the mayor and other prominent men for ransom? 

>That is on reason I am so dubious of claims that any crime would be
>"impossible" in Imperium. 

In that case I have good news for you. No one, not even me, has ever claimed
that piracy would be impossible in the sense that perpetuum mobiles are
impossible. What I said was that piracy _as depicted in the CT sources_ did
not make sense.

We didn\'t miss that. The question becomes what is an acceptable low. We
mentioned that ships are very expensive. You then suggested that maybe
pirates only stole the cargo. Only trouble with that is that it seems
extremely unlikely that any pirate could steal enough cargoes to pays
his expenses.

Always assuming that the transit time between the two points are not so long

Granted. But then, I never claimed otherwise. I said that piracy as depicted
in CT sources didn\'t make sense. This kind of piracy is not depicted in any
CT source that I can recall. Specifically the pirate ships you encounter via
the random ship encounter tables show up at the jump limits of mainworlds
and gas giants.

Not to say that you can\'t have things working that way in YTU if it works
for you, but the rules strongly imply that they don\'t work like that in
the OTU. Since it is quite true that a planet moves quite a bit in two days
the very fact that the rules do not mention any great variation in travel
times regardless of the duration of the jump makes it likely that the jump
exit point moves with the planet.

A fast ship is a costly ship (and one with little cargo space). You\'re
gunning for random ships which indicates that your take is likely to be
average. If you don\'t even take the cargo I don\'t see just what you
expect to grab, but even with stealing cargo, a pirate needs to catch
a ship of roughly its own size about five times a year to break even.

Wherever did you get that idea? The Imperium allows merchant lines to have

Not based on any canonical sources I can recall.

A more cogent problem for jump-1 and jump-2 merchants is that arming the
ships will cut down payload space and increase the cost significantly if
they want to be able to maneuver and shoot at the same time. Thanks to the
rule that the power plant factor must be at least half the value of the
jump number jump-3 and higher vessels have power to spare and only lose
the space actually taken up by the weapons. Still, that\'s an added problem
for the would-be pirate.

Every tramp freighter I can recall seeing in a Traveller module have been
armed.

Propably not. Not unless Grandfather comes out of retirement. The last time

(Btw. I don\'t like conspiracy theories all that much, but for you Templar

Did you ever see the article I wrote which attempts to introduce the minor

I put the planetary nobility in between SL 10 and the Imperial nobility. The
Imperial nobility wound up with social levels from 24 (baron) to 33 (emperor).

FYI: In the historical feudal system oaths of fealthy were to the man directly

Viceroy was a posting, not a rank. That dosen\'t mean that you can\'t use it
in a different way, of course.

Which one ?

There is the Ministry of Justice, Naval Intelligence, large chunks of the
IISS (Detatched Duty Office\'s Intelligence Branch, External Mapping Office
in Imperial Grand Survey, Security Office in Operations Office, Contact and
Liason Branch in the Exploration Office are the obvious ones) and friends
of Bubbles (not really official, more some friends of Bubbles who get asked
to do a couple of favours, and get slipped a blank Imperial warrant in case
they need it) the ones that come to mind.

Werent there two, or more, competing IN Intelligence agencies anyway ?

Wow, thats probably ummm four different intelligence agencies within the
IISS, not all of whom go through \'Operational Control\' (CLB goes via Fleet
Support and Intelligence Branch reports direct to DDO and then to IISSHQ).
And I thought my work was a mess when it came to operational
responsibilities ("Repeat after me : Peter Reeves was looking after that" ;
"Didnt he die from a heart attack three weeks ago" ; "Yeah, he\'s picked up
a lot of work since he died").

That\'s a good point, but no amount of charisma will allow you to breathe
vacuum. The bills have to be paid somehow. If you can\'t steal it, the
owner/captain has to foot the bills himself. That can become very
expensive. Let\'s forget about purchase price and bank loans, since we
are told that Vargr corsairs usually start out by stealing the patrol
ship they are manning. But a standard Vargr Corsair (p. 13 of Alien
Module 3) requires a yearly refit costing Cr213,000 each year. The crew
requires Cr500,000/year in life support if it carries crew only. If it
also carries boarders, the bill becomes Cr1,200,000. And every time a
victim gets in one lucky shot the repair bills can run into millions.
Not to mention paying the crew.

Still, if the owner dosen\'t want to get any return on the money tied up
in the ship, the economics becomes much more managable. So maybe Vargr
corsairs are possible as a charisma generating transaction: You put in
money and get out charisma.

I presume you mean UNable.

Yes, that is exactly what I\'m saying. The amount of naval power that the
Domain of Deneb can muster according to CT sources is so great that it is
those (equally canonical, I grant you) MT portrayals of Vargr incursions
that are unreasonable. We had a long discussion about it some time ago,
and I had to conceed that the Vargr incursion into Corridor is just barely
defensible (mostly because a close look at various sources reveal that they
didn\'t so much conquer several of the high-powered worlds in Corridor as
go around them/ally with them/leave them alone.) But the incursions into
the Domain proper are only possible if Norris decides to ignore them.
Which is somehow not the Norris I recognize.  

>IMHU & IMTU the Imperial Navy does not want to create a causus beli

That is of course the way to go. Political decisions can hamstring the most
powerful military engine. It then becomes your call how likely you consider
it. Historically known pirate havens have lasted only as long as the nation
suffering the depredations have been unable to muster the strength to do
something about them. If you chose to believe that the Imperium would
accept frequent corsair raids rather than anger the Vargr, all I can say
is that your beliefs are not mine.

Take a look at the logistics involved. For such a coordinated effort to
succeed, the Vargr nations on the Imperium\'s edge will have to provide
support for the forces from the more coreward nations, and the corsairs
from the coreward areas will have to decide that going 20 parsecs to raid
the Imperium is a better idea than going five parsecs to raid a neighbor
whose defenses has been weakened by going to war with the Imperium.

Do you have any idea how many Vargr it takes to put one of them on a
starship? About 5000.

Sure. What he won\'t have is enough starships to put them on.

Wherever did you get that idea? The Imperium allows merchant lines to have
their own escort ships, member worlds to have their own navies, and
(licenced) individuals to have cruisers squadrons.

(Nearly) anyone can put a turret-mount laser, civilian-grade missile
rack or sandcaster on their merchantman. Getting anything better
means you have a mercenary charter, or are a subject government
of the Imperium - either way, you are directly or indirectly controlled
by the Imperium. (ref: Mercenaries forced into "Bad War" contracts
by the Imperium).

Pirates steal ships. Allowing private military warfleets can foment
rebellions that can steal subsectors.

Every tramp freighter I can recall seeing in a Traveller module have been
armed.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Armed with civilian-grade "defensive" weaponry. Compare to the standard
Zhodani small merchant craft - no weaponry, nor even the hardpoints
to carry them. Zho society is so controlled that there aren\'t any pirates.
Your pointing out that "every tramp freighter" is armed in the Imperium
illuminates how dangerous the spacelanes of the Imperial frontiers must
be to small merchant craft.

Think about it - the only thing those light weapons are good for is
fending off a light commerce raider - a merchant gone bad, a privateer
or a pirate. The Empire allows small merchant craft to mount these
things (though in a limited fashion) - it would not allow it, nor would
people do it if there weren\'t a need. Piracy, or the threat thereof, must
exist in the frontier and less-developed areas of the Imperium.

Note GDP\'s Ship Operator\'s Manual - several example Free Traders are
shown, with armament ranging from some sandcasters on a ship
operating near core to triple beam lasers, triple missile rack and a
salvaged military sensor suite on a frontier model (though the armed
to the teeth Trader was listed as being in debt from the upgrades and
taking some risky/shady cargoes to make up the losses). If the
frontiers aren\'t dangerous due to piracy, why are free trader captains
spending millions of credits on weapons and gunners?

Maybe you think they\'ll use the space combat weapons to scare off
the local revenue cutters. ;)

I think the existance of Mercenary Charters is very revealing of
Imperial policy towards member worlds. The Impies don\'t care if you
get invaded by your neighbor world (ref: Vilis takes over Tanoose aka
Garda-Vilis in the LBB Broadsword). They don\'t care if the countries
on your world tear themselves apart, to a point. They _do_ care that
the means to wage interstellar war - member world navies and
starmercs - are licensed, regulated, and ultimately under Imperial
control. (If you regulate something, you control it.)

This indicates to me that as long as the X-boats run, as long as an
outside power isn\'t involved, as long as powerful nobles and megacorps
aren\'t inconvenienced, the Imperium is willing to let it\'s member worlds
go hang. As long as the taxes get paid, and as long as the leadership
of the world pays homage to the Empire. 

The Ine Givar rebel group isn\'t mad about bad taste in Imperial decor,
or protesting against posh villas for Viscounts and above - the Ine Givar
and other subversive groups in the Imperium think the Empire is a
Bad Idea. It takes more than it gives, it fosters local rivalries for
it\'s own convenience, it takes away people\'s rights based on
decisions made a hundred parsecs away. Enough people thought
the Empire was based on Bad Ideas that it unravelled as fast as
news of Strephon\'s death could be reported.

If you\'ve ever seen the painting "Reflections" of the
Vietnam Wall in Washington, you\'ve seen the man
standing there with his hand on the wall, mourning
his dead father or brother who was killed.  What he
doesn\'t see is the reflection from the other side
showing that relative with HIS hand on the wall,
touching the hand of his survivor.  That painting
inspired this story.

FROM THE OTHER SIDE
By Patrick Camunes

"There are so many things that are written about
the Wall but never anything of being on the other
side. I was inspired by the picture Reflections that I
use as wallpaper on my PC and a recent story,
Autumn Wall."

At first there was no place for us to go until
someone put up that Black Granite Wall.  Now,
everyday and night, my Brothers and my Sisters
wait to see the many people from places afar file in
front of this Wall.  Many stopping briefly and many
for hours and some that come on a regular basis. It
was hard at first, not that it\'s gotten any easier, but
it seems that many of the attitudes towards that war
that we were involved in have changed. I can only
pray that the ones on the other side have learned
something and more Walls as this one needn\'t be
built.

Several members of my unit and many that I did not
recognize have called me to the Wall by touching
my name that is engraved upon it.  The tears aren\'t
necessary but are hard even for me to hold back.
Don\'t feel guilty for not being with me, my Brothers.
This was my destiny as it is yours, to be on that
side of the Wall.

Touch the Wall, my Brothers, so that we can share
in the memories that we had.  I have learned to put
the bad memories aside and remember only the
pleasant times that we had together.  Tell our other
Brothers out there to come and visit me, not to say
Good Bye but to say Hello and be together again,
even for a short time and to ease that pain of loss
that we all share.

Today, an irresistible and loving call comes from
the Wall. As I approach I can see an elderly lady
and as I get closer I recognize her.......It\'s Momma!
As much as I have looked forward to this day, I
have also regretted it because I didn\'t know what
reaction I would have.

Next to her, I suddenly see my wife and
immediately think how hard it must of been for her
to come to this place and my mind floods with the
pleasant memories of 30 years past.  There\'s a
young man in a military uniform standing with his
arm around her......My God!......It\'s...it has to be my
son.  Look at him trying to be the man without a
tear in his eye.  I yearn to tell him how proud I am,
seeing him standing tall, straight and proud in his
uniform.

Momma comes closer and touches the Wall and I
feel the soft and gentle touch I had not felt in so
many years.  Dad has crossed to this side of the
Wall and through our touch, I try to convey to her
that Dad is doing fine and is no longer suffering or
feeling pain.  I see my wife\'s courage building as
she sees Momma touch the Wall and she
approaches and lays her hand on my waiting hand.
All the emotions, feelings and memories of three
decades past flash between our touch and I tell her
that it\'s all right.  Carry on with your life and don\'t
worry about me......I can see as I look into her eyes
that she hears and understands me and a big
burden has been lifted from her.

I watch as they lay flowers and other memories of
my past.  My lucky charm that was taken from me
and sent to her by my CO, a tattered and worn
teddy bear that I can barely remember having as I
grew up as a child and several medals that I had
earned and were presented to my wife.  One of them
is the Combat Infantry Badge that I am very proud
of and I notice that my son is also wearing this
medal.  I had earned mine in the jungles of
Vietnam and he had probably earned his in the
deserts of Iraq.

I can tell that they are preparing to leave and I try to
take a mental picture of them together, because I
don\'t know when I will see them again.  I wouldn\'t
blame them if they were not to return and can
only thank them that I was not forgotten.  My wife
and Momma near the Wall for one final touch and
so many years of indecision, fear and sorrow are
let go.  As they turn to leave I feel my tears that had
not flowed for so many years, form as if dew drops
on the other side of the Wall.

They slowly move away with only a glance over
their shoulder.  My son suddenly stops and slowly
returns.   He stands straight and proud in front of
me and snaps a salute.   Something makes him
move to the Wall and he puts his hand upon the
Wall and touches my tears that had formed on the
face of the Wall and I can tell that he senses my
presence there and the pride and the love that I
have for him.  He falls to his knees and the tears
flow from his eyes and I try my best to reassure him
that it\'s all right and the tears do not make him any
less of a man.

As he moves back wiping the tears from his eyes,
he silently mouths, God Bless you, Dad......   God
Bless, YOU, Son......  We WILL meet someday but
in the meanwhile, go on your way......  There is no
hurry.......There is no hurry at all.

As I see them walk off in the distance, I yell out to
THEM and EVERYONE there today, as loud as I
can,....THANKS FOR REMEMBERING and as
others on this side of the Wall join in, I notice that
the US Flag that so proudly flies in front of us
everyday, is flapping and standing proudly straight
out in the wind today....

THANK YOU ALL FOR REMEMBERING.

The answer to the first is entirely up to what the market is...basically what
the seller gets is the difference between the selling price and the remaining
principle on the original mortgage, minus the usual fees. 

The second answer is none...since ships don\'t appreciate, only depreciate, you
never get any money back on them, sort of like cars. The best you can do is
break even.

More seriously, I can\'t remember a Zho spy agency.  The closest thing

P=(d^3/m)^.5
P= period in years. Multiply by 365.25 to find period in days.
M= Mass in solar masses.
D=Distance in AU\'s. Multiply by 150 million to get kilometers. WTH uses
149.6 instead of 150.

D=(mp^2)^.33
as above.

WTH

P=Sqrt d^3/m   or P= Sgrt ([D/400,000]^3 x 793.64)/M
as above except in the latter case D=Distance in Kilometers.


Hope this helps.

Jim



Gravity in WTH is accomplished by die roll as follows:

1d6 for density. 1=low. 2-4=Average. 5-6= High
DM\'s -2 if in outer zone. Modified roll <1 =1

Low = .55:Average =1.0:High = 1.55

World Mass

M=K x(R/8)^3
M=mass in standard masses (Terra=1)
K=planet\'s density in in Earths(equivalencies .55,1.0 or 1.55)
R=UWP size digit (use 0.6 for size S)

from following table you get Gravity

Paranoia Press addressed this issue in their supplement, SORAG.  IIRC, that

In the real world, changes in gravity and gravity waves are generally
assumed to propogate at the speed of light, and there are all sorts of good
general relativity proofs that this is so. It remains a largely theoretical
issue as we haven\'t yet detected any gravity waves, of course.

Like many things in the Harrington books this isn\'t especially true or 
well-thought-out (why hadn\'t anyone thought of using grav drives to send 
signals before?)

Or (somewhat more internally consistently) moves at the velocity the ship
had when it entered jump - so normally one will match velocities with the

Would anyone who has run one of these things in the past like to provide
some idea of the effort involved? So that anyone who is thinking of
volunteering knows what they are getting into. For example:

How many entries did you get?

How long did it take to judge each entry?

How much background reading did you need to do?

What support tools did you need (spreadsheets, etc.)?

How much aggravation was there (flaming, coercion, etc.)?

and anything else you think might be useful to a prospective judge.

What would be the expenses that a pirate (or a band of pirates) would
reasonably have?

Ship Payments:  Even though corsairs are manufactured, I don\'t think
 	there would be many pirates making payments...  :->
Life Support:  Only used when ship is in use.
Maintenance:  Time based?  Usage based?  Regular "merchant" costs?
Living Expenses:  What standard of living?
Intelligence Gathering:
Bribery:

What I\'m asking, and maybe it was discussed some time ago, but how much
would it take to keep a Pirate band going?

M A D I S O N,   Wis.,   June 8 -
University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers are using the
genetic material DNA in an effort to develop new computers
that would offer an alternative to the traditional silicon chip. 
     Anne Condon, a UW-Madison computer scientist, is part
of the team studying DNA computers. 
     "I think there is always a need for faster and more
energy-efficient machines," Condon said. "DNA computing
offers one approach." 
     The chief attributes of DNA are its microscopic size and
powerful search function that can explore all possible answers
simultaneously. 
     The new machines could store information and process
large computational jobs at speeds faster than today\'s
supercomputers, researchers said. 
     Condon said it is too early to make predictions about when
the computers will be ready for commercial uses.

 From the Paranoia Press supplement, the name was at one time SORAG.
In typical spy-speak, the current existence of SORAG is denied.
 The Tavrchedl\' are, as noted, the internal intelligence/mental floss
brigade. The civil branch takes care of the population of the
Consulate.  The military branch act as psychological warfare and
integration agents beyond the Consulate\'s borders and on worlds
within the Consulate labeled "Unabsorbed". A proposed cross-border
branch takes care of expatriot Zhodani who, despite adjustment, cannot
live happily within the Consulate. Such folks are pressed into one-time
service beyond the borders doing jobs that regular agents cannot. If
anyone remembers the short-lived TV show "Masquerade" from some 15 years
ago, that gives a good idea of how this branch operates. I HAD a name
for them somewhere...

>What is the name of the Imperial Intellegence Service?

 There are the JSB, INI, and IISS:
  The Ministry of Justice, Special Branch (JSB) handles "internal"
counter-espionage, counter-terrorism, and similar. If you nuke a
planet and the Navy can\'t catch you immediately, the JSB WILL find
you eventually.
  Imperial Naval Intelligence (INI) is a typical military intel
organization.  Extra-Imperial target identification, threat evaluation,
and other things...
  Imperial Interstellar Scout Service (IISS) is an almost accidental
intelligence service. They poke their noses into EVERYTHING, and (usually)
keep records. Rumors of an "Office of External Affairs, Special
Circumstances" persist but are unproven.

  An article in White Dwarf many years ago described the Imperial
Secret Service, but I don\'t recall seeing any official notice of them...

 Hmmm. TL 6-7 Balkanized. Sitting on the border with the Sword Worlds.
Methinks this planet does not belong entirely to the Imperium, or that
Imperial membership is not accepted by all the population...

curiosity about some of us \'old farts\', go looking for a few things:

  -the PBEM that ran adjacent to the TML until about 7 years ago.
  -The Metlay Alien Sex Papers
  -The Horde
  -The collected essays of Catie Helm.
  -the FIRST time Meson-wielding submarines came up...eight years ago.
  -the first FOUR times near-C rock lobbing was argued over (all well before
MPGN took up the hosting of this list, BTW).
  -the great ragings over the new Traveller coming out: TNE.

 And do a search for "Rob Dean" and dare to tell me that we now AS AN ENTIRE

himself. This is not to belittle the work of Scott "2G" Kellogg or several
other master shipwrights of the day...

  What do you do with techniques that aren\'t _practical to counter_?
I.E., EMS data being recorded or beamed off-ship? 

  As a side point, if a valid objection is raised in a debate and no
counter-point can be provided, then the possibility arises that a major
factor has been isolated.

  And the level of risk needs to be justified by pay-off, which a number
of peoples efforts suggest isn\'t likely taking cargo only. Have you by any
chance run the numbers and guesstimated the bottom line for a given type
and number of hits per year?

  Clarification - _leaving the ship is proof that piracy occurred!_

...

  Yes, but if you take and sell the ship, you can retire. If the pigs
go hog-wild hunting other pirates. then it\'s hardly your concern, is it?
Besides, the thesis that piracy of starships will attract much less
interest if X ships are hauled over/shot up/robbed than if X ships
are stolen completely is substantially unproven, as the stimulus is an
attack on the Imperiums political structure.

  Presumably the "bad" ones get treated harshly and with priority.
This doesn\'t mean that the others are left to roam as harmless.

  If you read the passage (and I\'m not sure it\'s correct, FWIW), then

  Nor do I do so. Much more likely than a repeater (and 25% may be a
good assumption) is the dumping of EMS data to a police ship or facility
in the system.

  Good. Now what are the risks, and why do they occur? The point is 
that some of us think that rationally (although not neccessarily
played that way in our own TU\'s) piracy would be very rare.

  Unless one is a capable, trained observer, all visual reports _are_
unreliable. Ask a cop. I can think of som eawfully interesting things
that can be done with certain types of EMS data, but "it was a free
trader with red go-fasta stripes" isn\'t much use most times.

  I\'m assuming that cameras don\'t panic, have hang-overs, or have memory
retention problems until interfered with.

Virtual Girls and Digital Dates
By Michael J. Martinez
ABCNEWS.com

June 5 - She won\'t cook for you, you can\'t take her out on
the town, and, in fact, you can\'t take her off of your computer.
But if you don\'t pay enough attention to her and treat her
right, she\'ll get very angry. She might even leave you. 
     Her name is Rachel, she\'s from Italy and she\'s a Virtual
Girl. That\'s right: all software, no hardware. She\'s the latest
in computerized, interactive "girlfriends" - graphically-
enhanced programs designed to give users the experience
of having a girlfriend without the hassle. 
     Peruzzo Informatica, the Italian software company that
created Virtual Girl, describes it as a "Tamagotchi for adults"
after the Japanese virtual pet that became a worldwide fad. It
has been doing well in Europe and is expected to make its
way across the Atlantic soon. 
     Company president Alessandro Peruzzo says his program
is at worst a harmless diversion, and at best a tool for men to
learn how to improve their rapport with women. "It\'s a
simulator," he says. "You can test how you treat a woman, to
see if you\'re doing enough, or even too much."

I wasn\'t refering to that.  I was refering to the approach I mention
above which I wanted to separate from the piracy debate and address.

Leaving aside the fact that not everyone agrees that 2.7e17 cubic
kilometers of space (that 268 quadrillion cubit km, right?) is like
the space inside a police station.  My point was to address one
specific approach taken to trying to trying to prove something doesn\'t
exist, beyond just whether piracy is possible.  I don\'t claim that
this was the only approach to disproving piracy, or any specific
aspect of it (nor was piracy the only issue this line of arguement
was used for), or that showing the problem with this approach will
resolve the piracy debate.  I do feel that addressing this
can help keep debates to more realistic territory.

This is not intended to counter any specific recent arguements.
Instead, it is a response to a general approach that I see pop
up now and again over a long period of time.

I wasn\'t refering to that.  I was refering to the approach I mention

Leaving aside the fact that not everyone agrees that 2.7e17 cubic
kilometers of space (that 268 quadrillion cubit km, right?) is like
the space inside a police station.  My point was to address one
specific approach taken to trying to trying to prove something doesn\'t
exist, beyond just whether piracy is possible.  I don\'t claim that
this was the only approach to disproving piracy, or any specific
aspect of it (nor was piracy the only issue this line of arguement
was used for), or that showing the problem with this approach will
resolve the piracy debate.  I do feel that addressing this
can help keep debates to more realistic territory.

This is not intended to counter any specific recent arguements.
Instead, it is a response to a general approach that I see pop
up now and again over a long period of time.

My take on the rules it that it seems clear that this issue has not
been considered, not that it was decided that the exit point moves
with the planet.  In my book this goes under things not constrained
by canon.

You are probably right, they won\'t be able to get them on payments.  Which
makes the up-front cost pretty high!  Unless they are able to take a ship
with suitable armament, they will have to buy one.  Without the credentials
to get a loan, they will have to cough up the credit.

However, a band may have one or two \'legitimate\' ships or have a \'front\'
through which they channel their ill-gotten goods that does use \'clean\'
ships and through which they may make payments.

>Life Support:  Only used when ship is in use.


Unless they have a base with a habitable atmosphere, that would be 100% of
the time.

>Maintenance:  Time based?  Usage based?  Regular "merchant" costs?


Again, unless they have a base or a ship tender, this can be tricky.  Of
course, they could always try for Vargr or Sword World space and get
maintenance done here.

Besides regular maintenance, however, there will also be combat repairs that
will need to be performed (and paid for.)

>Living Expenses:  What standard of living?


Pretty damn high when they have money, pretty miserable the rest of the
time.  There is also the issue of where pirates go to have fun, and how they
get there without getting caught.

>Intelligence Gathering:
>Bribery:


Absolutely essential.  A good band will have people in a number of starports
to funnel traffic data to them.  Hopefully, they will be able to get someone
into a starport who will have access to the ship\'s registry for that
subsector and be able to erase or alter the ship\'s data for the ships the
band may capture.

Downport Construction Costs (Version 2)

What are some of the costs involved in building a downport?
Here is a partial list of things you might put into a starport,
and what they might cost.

I. LANDING STRIPS

Ships have to land!  There are two ways to land a starship:
some are airframe, which means they can use a runway, while
the rest must stick to vertical thrust to slowly set themselves
down onto pads.

Imperial-standard landing strips have both built-in: a 5km
long strip for airframe landings, ending in a 1km diameter
circular landing pad.  These strips are also used for airframe
take-off.  The cost runs from KCr10 per kilometer.

Landing facilities may also have an attached beacon, perhaps
placed midway along the strip or near other outbuldings.  A beacon
may include sensors and comm equipment, and may have its own
power plant.  It may cost from MCr5 up.

II. PARKBAYS

Ships are moved via maglev rail to parkbays, which are circular
platforms with 11 bays, each of which can hold a ship of up to
1000 tons.  Maglev rail enters the parkbay and runs in a circle
around the inside, with a branch into each bay.  In the center is a
single shielded vertical liftoff platform (also connected to
the maglev system).

One parkbay costs MCr100.  A group of 6 parkbays, laid out in a
hexagonal pattern and joined by maglev rail, costs MCr700.

III. FUEL

Fuel is provided in A, B, C, and D class ports.  Refueling stations
may have depots, refineries, and tankers.

A. FUEL DEPOTS

Fuel depots can be as simple as huge holding tanks, and may have
mechanical hookups or pumps to refuel ships with.  Depots may
cost from Cr1000 per ton.

B. FUEL REFINERIES

Fuel refineries are cousins to the shipboard fuel refineries, and
are used to refine fuel on the spot for ships requiring it.
Refineries may cost from MCr1 per ton.

C. FUEL TANKERS

Tankers, which may be simply shuttles or modular cutters, are 
ships outfitted to carry fuel, and may or may not have refineries
on-board to provide refined fuel for the starport holding tanks.
Tankers run at the going price of spaceships; for example, the
price may be around MCr4 per ton of fuel the tanker can carry.

IV. SHIPYARD

A shipyard is necessary for the construction and maintenance of
spaceships and starships.  Shipyards can be quite large -- their
size may depend on the amount of trade going through a system,
or the size of the local population, or even the strategic
importance of the system\'s location.

A normal repair yard may cost around KCr25 per ton of ship 
serviceable.

A repair yard capable of ship overhaul (for example, for a ship\'s
annual maintenance) may cost KCr200 per ton of ship serviceable.

A shipyard capable of producing spaceships (that is, non-jump
capable ships) may cost MCr5 per ton of ship capacity.

Lastly, a shipyard which can build jump-capable starships may
cost MCr6+ per ton of ship capacity.

Warehouses (with environmental controls, security systems, heavy
shielding, &tc) for storing ship parts and construction equipment
may cost KCr1 per displacement ton.

V. BASES

There are three kinds of bases here: Scout way stations, Scout
bases, and Naval bases.

A. SCOUT WAY STATIONS

Way stations are smaller versions of the Scout base.  They
might use existing landing facilities; they have some equipment
and buildings, and will almost certainly have their own fuel.  
Such a base may cost MCr50.

B. SCOUT BASES

Scout bases have refueling equipment, a parkbay, some service 
equipment and warehousing, and administration offices.  Such a 
base may cost MCr200.

C. NAVAL BASES

Naval bases are huge affairs, often larger than the local starport
itself.  A naval base may have an airstrip and a hexlet of 6
parkbays all to itself, as well as depots, refineries, and service
centers.  The naval bases may cost from BCr100.

V. TERMINAL

The terminal itself is the exoskeleton of the starport, and consists
of the framework around which the above components may be placed.

A. MAGLEV NETWORK

The ship maglev rail network connects the airstrips, parkbays, and
shipyards.  Likewise, the human maglev rail network comprises the
transport between all these points for passengers, crew, military,
and vendors.  The maglev network may cost from MCr10 up to MCr100+.

B. CONTROL TOWER

The control tower contains the main body of comm equipment and
traffic control logic, as well as the administrative offices.
The Tower may cost from MCr100+.

C. CONCOURSE

The concourse comprises all passenger, crew, and vendor facilities,
including lounges, shops, and ticketing, plus all of their information 
management systems.  Concourses cost from MCr10+.

D. OFFICE SPACE

The brokerage quality available depends on the starport class; so, then,
do the brokerage facilities (and other offices) depend on the starport 
class.  As the starport class improves, so does the size and cost
of building offices there:

Starport Class		Facilities Cost
A			KCr80/ton
B			KCr40/ton
C			KCr20/ton
D			KCr10/ton

This might be the cost of allocation rather than actual construction...
i.e. the buildings are built, but the floors are empty.

You might be on the mark, except the planet is Cymbeline (sp?) and it was a
Terran warship during the Interstellar Wars...

I also remember hearing about an IISS 
"Covert Survey Bureau" - presumably one who\'s official purpose is surveying
uncontacted Red Zone worlds, but with a secondary general intelligence 
purpose - but I don\'t recall whether this was official. I would say that
intelligence gathering *has* to be a major reason why the IISS lends people
Scout/Couriers - producing a huge fleet of ships with good sensor suites
wandering in and out of the borders of the Imperium; easy to hide a few
real spies among the herd.

My take is that the most efficient thing to do is to match 1/2
of the velocity difference between the systems before you jump
and 1/2 of it later.

IIRC a lot of the sunbane stuff got moved to ftp.mpgn.com  The metolius

The ftp.nau.edu stuff has bounced around, last known address I know of

Well, as the original proposer of the idea I\'ve given it some thought since
I\'ll probably do it if no one else volunteers.

The setup I would imagine would be based on a web-site with announcements
to the list. The web site would contain:
Competition related:
* The current topic, constraints, and deadline
* Past topics, the entries, and the winners
Design related:
* A listing of the errata to be used for the ship design sequences
* Clarifications of existing rules and/or terms for purposes of the
competition (which stateroom to be used for passengers/crew, whether to
environ the fuel tanks, etc)
* How designs are generally rated, if not part of the constraints or topic
Tooling:
* Links to other ship design pages
* Uploads (or links to uploads) of ship design tools (spreadsheets, mainly)

Announcements to the list would be:
* Initial topic, constraint and deadline announcment for each competition
* A reminder two days before deadline
* The announced winners

Yes, but since the issue of principal and interest is glossed over in the
starship payment plans, this doesn\'t help.  Technically, you could never
sell a starship until you had made 20 years of payments on it, because
only after 20 years are you dpwn to paying only the ship\'s original price.
The fact is that if you want to pay off your house early, you pay nowhere
near as much as if you pay it off over the whole length of the mortgage.
So if you pay off your ship early, do you only pay off the principal and
not the interest?  How much is each?

So for instance, you have a MCr40 ship, and have made 10 years of payments
on it.  If you pay off over 40 years, you will have paid MCr 80 for the
ship.  But if you wanted to pay it off - ineffect someone else is taking
out a loan, giving you the money to pay off your ship, then they are
paying that loan back to their own bank with interest.

So the question is how much of the MCr 40 have you paid off after 10
years, 20 years, etc.?  Does someone have an amortization program that
they might run these numbers through and figure out what the interest rate
is on a loan which results in paying exactly twice the loan amount back
over 40 years?

What about a ship which you aquire as a Mustering benefit. It already has
10 or 20 years of payments made on it if you rolled well. How much can you
sell this ship for, considering that the buyer will have 10 or 20 years
less payments than if he bought it new?

Things have been kinda dead on the list (besides the twice-annual piracy
debate, I mean).  I found this comment of Bloo\'s in my archives  - does
anyone want to bite?

That is, what resources does anyone know of on the Web pertaining to the
art and science of campaign building?  I have copies of Analog articles on
psychohistory, for instance, but those are long out of print, and may have
been superceded.

The TML PBeM is still alive (but sluggish of late.)  About 2/3s of the
original players are still involved, and you can catch up on the whole
mess by checking: http://www.ssgfx.com/traveller.  BTW, we are currently
not open to new players, but hope to be in the future.  Also, BTW, Metlay
and I took over GM\'ing the game (with Richard Johnson\'s blessing) after
Richard decided to throw in the towel.

The Sunbane (at U. of Western Ontario, Waterloo, CA) and Metolius
(Tektronix, Beaverton, OR) archives are both toast.  They were wiped
by their respective owners years ago.

However...

Dan Corrin (the admin for Sunbane back then) is still in the PBeM and
has promised to get me the *entire* Sunbane archive on tape (which he
backed up before leaving UWO.)  Don\'t know how soon (or even *if*) this
will take place, but I\'m keeping my fingers crossed.

Mark Cook (a fellow TML\'er) of Shoestring Graphics is working on the five

bad bout 
of the flu I have decided to push back the "take the manuscript/insert to

deckplans justice and I feel is well worth the slight delay.

Since the date has been pushed back from the 10th to the 20th,  this should
give anyone who wants to make a late minute order enough additional time to
get their payment in (I have 14 copies left at present), but please be
prompt if you do intend to place an order.

I will have everyones order in the mail by June 30th at the latest (my

July 7th). I will post a final update the day I mail the last package.

Ok, I think that covers nearly everything I needed to say.

Sure, I\'ll bite.  We should have several resources at our disposal but
can we get there co-operation is the question. The number 1 and 2 best
suggestion that come to mind would be MM and LW. But I know just from
reading some of the mail that others have some pretty good, strong ideas
that could be included. So where do we go from here???

 I tend to disagree with this. I\'m not sure, but I think the analogy was
made from a comparison of how the US moon flight was accomplished, ie
the mission took off travelling counter clockwise around earth, and when
the time was deemed right (by NASA calculations) the engines were fired
up enough to project the mission enroute. When it reached its objective
it took up an opposite rotation (clockwise) around the moon. While the
command module remained in orbit, the lander landed and when their work
was accomplished then rejoined the command module and following a
similar routine as above plotted and initiated the return trip. 
The general principle is shown in MT- ref\'s companion p23 for sure and
IIRC there is at least one other reference. This indicates to me that
the problem was considered, albeit maybe not to int\'s fullest from the
data then know, but it would sure make sense to me that both
interstellar and interplnetary travel would be other than a hap-hazard
guesstimate.

I adapted this from a table of standard amortization schedules, based on
the 2.3% APR implied in the starship financing rules.  I\'ve rounded a bit
(<2%) to make the numbers nicer, but that\'s the only change:

"Over time, your ownership in the ship increases as the 
debt owed the bank decreases:

It sounds like a fine plan, just be sure the MCV has a good reason for
doing this to the HA\'s. IOW, what\'s in it for the MCV? Does he want
their ship? Is it revenge for something they did to him, someone he
cares about, or his organization in the past?

Not the in the "Honor Harrington" universe. No specific "speed" is
given, but it is *much* greater than c. From the discriptions, I think
you could say gravity propogates at infinite speed in HH\'s universe,
but the range at which it can be detected as a useful signal is very
limited. The rate of data transfer was also *very* low, IIRC, maybe a
few bits per minute.

Take it from this point of view.  San Francisco International Airport
(SFO), is too small, has one of the worst ontime records in the country,
has just been called one of the most dangerous in the world, and has been
under *constant* construction for nearly fifty years.

Total cost (adjusted): 1.6 Billion Dollars.

To get a facility that could handle HEPLaR ships, along with the orbital
traffic control, etc.. I can see 6 Bil.  That would also include
infrastructure and supporting industries.

There is some information in AM6 covering UNSCA (United Nations Space 
Coordinating Agency) and the colonisation of the Solar System. There is some 
more info in S&A and a couple of the MTJ. I\'ve been doing some work on the 
Interstellar Wars period and I\'d be happy to send you that (its based on the 
published works). I believe a proper canon E21 suppliment is intended at some 
stage.

Thanks. This is just what I wanted.  But it brings up another question.
When you aquire a ship as a mustering out benefit, has the 20% downpayment
been made on it for you? If so, the the principal remaining on this brand
new ship is only 80%.

Assuming the table above is the case:  The cash price is MCr 30.75, and you
have only 80% of the principal remaining to pay off = MCr 24.6

So the question is, if you weren\'t interested in the trader\'s life, could
you turn around and sell it for the bargain price of MCr 28 and retire on
the extra few million credits?

  Inconsistent? How? We\'ve established that you won\'t bother doing any
Traveller number crunching, or at least sharing the process with anyone.
Do you require narrow economic analysis in debate? I\'ve only seen the
case made that what would normally be considered political decisions be
assessed using an economic decision making model with no apparent real
world basis.

  Isn\'t this the same discussion you had with Hans\'? It could be that

  Part of the persistent problem in these threads is that your standards
of evidence differ radically from those of the so-(mis-)called "Piracy
is Impossible" faction. If so, perhaps avoiding discussion of technical
aspects of these would be best all around?

  Any points I\'ve dropped have been in the interest of staying on topic
or simply not getting stuck in a morass of your "disagreements". If there
are any points that we\'ve addressed that you feel were dropped without
necessary explanation please inform me and I\'ll try to address them or
explain my unwillingness to do so. I\'m surprised that you allowed the
dropping of useful points to go by w/o comment.

  Given the level of effort and attention you often seem to apply, I have
to wonder if you cared about the thread in the first place (see below).
I\'m simply not concerned with getting in the last word here. So there! :>

  I often spend too much of my time in these threads explaining what

  The point was that a fuel-station, even if somehow not worth arming
in its\' own right (which seems odd) will almost certainly attract other
activity that will be worth defending or may have integral armament.
Further, the paragraph that you\'re responding to indicates clearly that
the trade station is more likely than a fuel station, and that if one 
were absent it would be the fuel station.

...

  I felt it was only fair to allow you to prepare your own counter model

  As you can see, you only recently appeared to abandon them. I had assumed
until then that you had a consistent model you were proposing. Again, please
save me the effort of researching your threads for you.

  The case was explained as involving insufficent heavy units to do that.
I can send that to you as well, but it would be simpler if you checked the
archives.

  As explained IYTU, peacetime ID is essentially unconfirmed? If I\'ve
misunderstood, then a brief explanation would be appreciated.

  As for the rest, I assume that both war and peacetime transponders
will be meaningfully secure, and that convoy ID will be trivial to
confirm. What about individual ships jumping in and needing fuel to
continue their escape from a warzone that they require demountable
tanks to survive in?

...

  How fast is that tanker? If built as a space/starship the cost is quite
great relative to fuel capacity. Does the freighter broadcast using its\'
radio and hope no hostiles are there to hear? Does the fuel facility do so?

...

  OK. It\'s hard to argue with logic like that. No doubt that we\'ll be able

  Tell me about it. The odd thing is, I don\'t have a problem with being
wrong, just with being wrong and not finding out about it. I\'ve had (and
do have) disagreements with most of the other posters on the piracy thread
- - Hans, Mr. Smith, Tommy Grav, and Mr. Whitchurch to start with, although
not all involve piracy.

  Part of the problem seems to be that some of us (perhaps unreasonably)
have certain standards of evidence that you feel you\'re meeting, when we
perceive you to be mostly stating disagreement or invalidity of offered
evidence without substantial support.

Can\'t say I like this idea much.  I\'d rather leave my ship in orbit and use

I always figured that 80-90% of the facilities of such bases would bein

Let me clarify my original intention.  I wasn\'t thinking of the art and science
ofcampagn bulding really.  I was thinking of a combination of two things.
One, a Traveller Bible,I guess you would call it.  All the Canon.  All the
timelines.
All the library data.  Two, rules for dealing with large and small scale events
over
time.

I think we all understand the first part.  And for me, this would be the most
usefull and interesting.

Let me say something about the second.
I was thinking of tables for modifiers of languages over time, i.e., if a TL 12
society devolves to TL4 for X amount of years, the modifier for a \'modern\'
galanglic speaker to understand them would be Y.  Tables (possibly taken from
PE) for ramping up TLs.  Breakdown rates for materials based on TL of
production, e.g., a 5 century old TL9 starship might be completely useless, but
a 5 century old TL 15 ship would only have X% of systems failed/useless..

A variation of this was done by EE Doc Smith in one of the Lensman
books.

Also there is an East European (Russian?) Film depicting a
post-nuclear-war underground community consisting entirely of women
reproducing by artificial means. Chaos ensues when two men arrive on the

So, you\'re asking if you can make a character that retires straight out of the

I\'m not sure this would be the case. I think it would matter _when_ in
the tech level the ship was built. A TL9 starship built near the end of
the tech level, with mature and well-understood technologies, should
far outlast a TL15 starship built out of experimental designs by a
TL14.99999 society.

The operational life of a DC3 vs the operational life of a 747, for example.

Of course, you can have things built with TL15 materials but using
TL9 designs. I recall a Star Trek:Next Gen show where the Enterprise
aids a free trader type ship. The engineer replaces a main drive
component, the free trader asks how he\'s ever going to get such a
high-tech piece serviced - the Enterprise guy points out that the new
piece is going to outlast the ship by several hundred years.

Take a starship design at TL9 - a type S Scout, for example. Build it
with all TL15 materials, from hull plates to carpeting. The design allowed
for wear and stress tolerances of TL9 materials - how much longer
will it last than something of TL9 manufacture? How much longer will
it last than something of TL15 manufacture that was designed at TL15,
and so will be designed to test the wear and stress limits of the materials
more closely?

If they built cars with today\'s steel and designs from the 1930\'s, the cars
would last a century.

No, I\'m not. I\'m asking why this doesn\'t happen. I expect more than just
PCs are receiving starships as mustering out benefits, eh?  And having a
few million credits invested somewhere doesn\'t make a character boring to
play  ;)  (at least I hope MY life isn\'t boring after I get my few mill

I mostly was interested in the question because I wanted to use this as

Well, I for one think that receiving a ship as a mustering out benefit is strictly a
plot device sort of thing.  Without a ship, you\'re hardly a "traveller" thus there
needs to be a means to get the characters from point A to point B. I think also that
one of the assumptions to receiving a ship is that the character made investments
towards buying the ship during his career.  If a character then sells the ship, then
its quite obvious that it never was his intention to own the ship and therefore
would not have invested into the ship in the first place.

TNE has another preventative measure.  At best, the GROUP gets one ship between
them.   Everyone contributes their share towards getting one ship.  Whoever has the
most shares determine the class of vessel.  Thus, if you sell said ship, you have to
divide the proceeds among the various members of the group.  While still a chunk of
change, it certainly isn\'t enough to retire on.  I think there is also the option to
sell your shares directly, which is probably the best route for somebody that
doesn\'t want a ship.

Per FF&S, it appears that an active black globe entering atmosphere will absorb
energy from the atmosphere until it overloads, at which point you now have a
ship with overloaded capacitors--which will probably have taken enough damage
that it will crash.  This is presumably about as dangerous as any other
spaceship crash of comparable velocity and tonnage.

This could be fun. Retired, with a pension, hence no money worries. You

A pencil, a pad of graph paper, and a calculator.  I used to have a sheet of
a few standard "packages" of stuff worked out, and would just plug those
in.  I ought to scrounge around and find the "Designer\'s Notes" file on
MT shortcuts--anybody good at dredging the old archives?

IMTU, it is possible, but only with special permission.

Since the Imperium rules the space between the worlds, I ruled the following:

The Imperium taxes off planet trade, assuming roughly 10% of the GDP comes
from it and the associated infrastructure.  Of that, they take a third.

The Imperium assumes large military machine, costing roughly 5% of
planetary GDP.  Again, they take roughly a third of this assumed budget,
unless the world is judged "incapable of competent self defense."

As a result, the Imperium taxes 8% of GDP from all member worlds, though of
that 8%, somewhat over half is expected to be put back in the form of local
armed forces, space navies, noble fiefs, and noble reinvestments.  If they
do not have some idea what is going off world, it is hard to determine
economic numbers, from which taxes are determined.  They do have Scouts
analyzing economies on site, but they prefer numbers which can be measured.

So, they are very interested in trade taking place, and thus any ship
landing at a private field is required to get the "No, I am not smuggling
anything the Imperium cares about" seal of approval.  This can be done by
getting permits for things shipped out privately, and the powerful will
usually have someone on staff who is trusted by Imperial customs to sign
permits.  It is the presence of such people that makes a star port
extraterritorial, and they usually do not transfer this right to many
places in a system, since it is the Imperium\'s responsibility to patrol it.
 As a result, the legal fiction is that the customs guy is working at the
main port, even though he is approving a cargo half a world away.

This opens up huge ground for smuggling, and appropriate controls are in
place.  The details depend on the world, but the usual trick is that any
traffic requesting such a permit is more likely to be a smuggler, and so
has a higher chance of attention.  Sending over a pinnace once in a while,
or swapping out the inspectors, makes it possible to catch people in the
long run.

Those who cannot afford the permits issued off site will hire out to ship
the goods on the planet to the port, get them inspected there, and then
leave, using their starship as a glorified train or boat, and then
switching roles.  As a result, a player ship will almost always dock at the
port, even if only for that last customs inspection.

Imperial customs is very forgiving about goods shipped, as it is up to the
world\'s inspectors to keep out things they disapprove of.  To keep
relations reasonable, they do tend to do both inspections at once, and
share data.

The rule of thumb I use is based on today\'s real estate.  Instead of
financing a house, pay the amount of the house payment that would go to
equity into a savings account.  Most should find this a doable task early
in the note, and late in the note, you get the interest from earlier
contributions.  You will likely find that you can buy the house you wish
free and clear long, long before you would have paid off a note on the same
house.  It is similar to only buying property where you can make an extra
principle payment once a year.  this can take ten years off your repayment
time, because of the heavy weighting on principle early on.

Why don\'t people do this?  Because they do not want to live in lesser
surroundings for the years it would take to sock away money.  Further, if
they can pay off a $200K house in 30 years, or a $210K house in 40, most
would rather take the more expensive house.

In Traveller, the merchant who is making these ship payments wants a ship.
Where they to stop at any point, they would have a huge pile of money, but
they would rather slave to own it free and clear.  This is related to an
issue I brought up some time ago - ANY person with even a small ownerships
share in a ship is rich rich rich by any reasonable standard, so ports are
not going to be seedy.  They will look more like expensive law offices
designed to make overly wealthy people impressed.

I have no problem with a player deciding that the merchant life is not
panning out, and deciding to play a rich bum.  I have had a number do it,
usually buying a TAS membership to satisfy wanderlust.

IMTU:
The primary starport has extraterritorial status (meaning that the planetary
law level does not affect it), but if you land or go to one of the
auxilliary spaceports, you forfeit that protection.  (there is a balance,
the planet is not going to want to harass traders too much, but you still
can\'t just walk all over planetary law at a auxilliary port) Additionally,
all traffic with cargo or passengers must contact the starport for customs
clearance - before requesting the permission of COACC for a flight path for
a planetary landing.  I don\'t require the ship physically port with the
starport, but it may have to if there is a discrepency in it\'s \'papers\' and
there is no patrol ship or SDB available to ferry the customs inspection
team over (Generally a Imperial Naval Officer and 2 marines in BattleDress).

Life doesn\'t begin at the end of the CharGen process. If a 
character has a ship, it\'s probably because they scrimped 
and saved and dealed for 15-20 years to pay for it. Such a 
character wouldn\'t "get their start" by selling off the 
ship that they\'d worked so hard to pay for, they\'d have got 
their start through the work they did to pay the 
downpayment on the Ship. 

Assuming they bought the ship New, and it\'s now second 
hand, the price you can get for it is probably quite a bit 
less than full price. If the process is anywhere near as 
complex as buying a house, there are probably significant 
lawyer and broker fees as well. (In NZ if you sell a house 
today for 5k more than you paid for it yesterday, you\'re 
probably making a loss due to Agent and Lawyer fees).

Now as far as campaign justifications for NPC\'s yeah they 
could sell the ship, but consider that the bank has a 
certain amount of equity in it (80% at brand new) and the 
owner has 20% i.e. they have just sunk 6Mcr (in the 30Mcr 
example) into buying a new ship - selling it so that they 
get 4Mcr minus agent fee\'s back is not exactly a quick 
profit taking move although they have 4Mcr, they paid 6, 
and are thus losing 2MCr. 

Now it\'s likely that the Deposit was built up over many 
years, and might be the result of the "Merchants Ship 
Ownership" lottery, so the character never actually _had_ 
the 6Mcr in hand, but you can bet that they\'ve paid it 
either over time or in future subscriptions to the MSO


(sidebar -Merchants Ship Ownership Lottery) -  Merchants 
sign up to this when they join the merchant service. They 
divert a portion of their wages to the MSO every month. 
Once a month (or whatever is feasible)  the MSO does a 
lottery and gives one of the contestants a ship, with the 
proviso that they have to pay the amount owing off to 
the MSO, and keep paying the lottery fee each month.

In the long term, Most people get a ship deposit provided 
for them by the MSO (the longer you\'ve been in the more 
likely you are to get one) but it\'s still possible to get a 
deposit after only a couple of months - however you have to 
keep paying the deposit contribution to the MSO until 
you\'ve covered the cost.

There are "building societies" in NZ that work a little 
like this. There are rules about how much deposit you get 
(thus limiting the size of the ship you buy) and how much 
contribution you have to make. With the MSO\'s buying power 
and asset base they can get better prices (Yes, every month 
for the next 40 years we\'re going to order a ship - what 
discount can we get...) but relies on enough people joining 
to make it possible (If each person kicks in 500 Cr per 
month, then they need at least 12000 members to scrape up 
6Mcr per month - hmm, the numbers need adjusting) 
It\'s likely that the MSO will keep some of the discount in 
their own pocket to cover organisation costs and to put 
towards the deposit on other ships. If they get 10% then 
although they are lending the owner 6Mcr as deposit, they 
might actually only be paying 3Mcr.

It\'s supposed to balance out so that over the life of the 
lottery, each person pays off about what the deposit they 
get would have been, so they don\'t actually make free 
money, but they often get the deposit before they could 
have saved it up themselves. If over their lifetime they 
won\'t have paid back more than say half the amount, then 
only half the lottery entrants would get a ship over their 
lifetime of paying into the scheme. Maybe that\'s why only 
some merchants come out of the Merchant service with a 
ship?

I have always figured that most of the Navy base was 
orbital, and most scout bases are on the ground, since 
ground ports have got to be cheaper, and most scout ships 
are streamlined, wheras most serious naval vessels are not 
streamlined.

However after the recent discussion about the

this, though I haven\'t had too many conclusions yet.

The easy way to tell whether someone is Vilani is a blood test.

Vilani		C, N		C, D, M, N, O
Solomani	A, B, O		A, B, M, N, O, Z

[V&V. p.3]

For non-invasive, you can look at their circadian cycle; a person who is
adapted to the vilani lifestyle will have a 32 hour cycle, of 8hrs work, 8
hours rest, 8 more work, and 8 of sleep, as opposed to the typical solomani
2 hours rest, 8 work, 6 more rest, 8 sleep.

Realism must be brought here, for just a minute: Human Circadian Cycles on
earth are roughly 23-27 hours dependant on individual, assuming a lack of
obvious environmental time referent (i.e., sunlight and clocks). IIRC, the
mean was found to be around 24.6 hours. Living in alaska, where, in
Anchorage, the midsummer sun sets for 2 hours,  and it doesn\'t get darker
than twighlight, non-working individuals tend to adjust to their own
cycles. I believe that the vilani will have similar variations. I figure
that the only way vilani could have such a long schedule was some genetic
tampering by the Anchients.

another canonical referent for determination is that both vilani and
zhodani have narrower ranges of body types than solomani. Vilani tend to be
more muscular in build, and Zhoe\'s tend to be tall and thin, with vaguely
slavic or middle-eastern features.

I make this a local decision since import duties and restrictions are

Hi Bryan

I use Excel 4 and would gladly try helping you convert it to that
format. I should be able to import the file(s) directly in Lotus format
and I believe excel will convert same, either directly or with a minimum
amount of reformatting. I do not have a web site, but would make the
converted file available, however possible, if you would not be able to
receive it back in Excel format.

If you do not receive other, more knowledgeable replies, you can contact
me and I\'ll do what I can to help.

Or for an example of a purely *male* society, read Bujold\'s "Ethan of
Athos". I can actually *see* Athos as part of the Imperium. They\'d have
joined with some rather odd additions to the normal "treaty of
admission", but they\'d be better "protected" from the danger of women
by joining than by staying independent.

Not exactly. "Ethan of Athos" has the all male planet, but they have
*no* women, nor do they want any. They don\'t have a "nobility" either.

You *don\'t* go moving ships that are "tail-sitters" that casually. And
since there are a fair number of ships using reaction drives, you want
a wall (berm) surrounding the pad. That makes things very difficult for
your rail system.

Check the archives for a post I dea a year or two back about landing
bays.

I didn\'t like it much either. You *don\'t* go hauling around a ship
that\'s sitting on its tail without a *lot* of hassles. It\'s *not*
something that\'d be done as a mater of course.

Also, since some ships use things like HEPlar or other reaction drives,
you want a substantial barrier around the landing pad, for noise
abatement if nothing else.

Dig through the archives. I posted a good description of what the
landing bays at a port might be like a year or two back. They\'ll be
well spread out, and surrounded by thick berms of earth and concrete.
With a lot of storage and servicing stuff built into the berms.

"Virgin Planet" was by Poul Anderson. But it was one of at *least* 3
books with much the same plot. Another one was by A. Bertram Chandler,
IIRC.

Good choice of example, as the DC-3 has that rarity an *unlimited* type
airworthiness certificate. That is, unlike other planes, the *class* is
certified as being flyable *forever* as long as you keep up the
maintenance. Normally, there\'s a cut-off date after which planes of a
given type are no longer considered airworthy *regardless* of what
you\'ve done. 

With the DC-3, they kept pushing the date into the future, and finally
gave up and made it "unlimited". In fact, I think that someone has
actually started *producing* them again, as there\'s enough demand to
make it worthwhile. 

I figure that most "older TL" designs being used in the Imperium are
similar. They\'re based on things learned over *centuries*, so as long
as you keep up the maintenance, nobody is especially worried about how
old the ship is.

First thing is that "causing" a gravitational disturbance is *hard*.
Because gravity is so weak (yes, weak! It takes the mass of a planet to
generate a gravity field that can be beaten by a toy magnet), you have
to move a lot of mass very fast. And preferrably, the mass should be
very dense (neutronium type dense).

About the only thing that\'s going to generate a noticable gravity wave
with imperial tech is a ship jumping (in or out).

Gravity waves will propogate at lightspeed.

Per CT/HG2, when a black globe overloads, the ship carrying it *vaporises*.  
This is because it sinks every bloody joule of energy that impacts it, and 
this includes thermal and intertial, and if there\'s no place to dump the 
energy, you get the overload.

FWIW, IMNSFBHO, black globes *should* be rare and hard to find.  No *WAY* 
would I let a bunch of PCs get their hands on one!!!!  They\'re just too much 
\'juice\' for good game balance.  YMMV.

Check out "Ethan of Athos" by Lois McMaster Bujold for the Male-only, and
"Virgin Planet" by Poul Anderson for the Female-only...

 Two versions of the Zhodani trefoil are on my site:

 has the black version, and any of the links from there have one paled down
to background grey.  The trefoil has never been printed in any color other

Yes, which is why I\'m not using Heplar. I\'m trying to use ANTR but whenever I 
enter anything in the ANTR box it causes an error in the Heplar section, also 
the error in the Thrusters section simply is there when I drop the missile TL 
below 11.

Poul Anderson wrote Virgin Planet.  For some truly *awesome* recontact
fiction try his story "The Sharing of the Flesh", or even better, his
novel _The Night Face_ written in 1958 and still a classic. Both are
stories about genetic drift on lost colony worlds, *perfect* for just
after the Long Night.

_Ethan of Athos_ and it had no women at all on it, they were all gay and
women were semi-legendary monsters.  There was a great scene where Ethan
(the protagonist) was in a seedy starport bar attempting to recruit the
locals emigrate to wonderful Athos, far from all thos dangerous women.  He
couldn\'t understand why they first laughed at him and then chased him out
angrily.

\'Virgin Planet\' was by Poul Anderson.  My copy was published in London by
Mayflower in 1969 if that\'s any help.  155 pages.

Couple hundred, maybe a couple thousand.  Depends on your tech level & your 
attitudes towards eugenics & genetic engineering.  Methinks if you\'re not 
*too* squeamish about weeding out the local gene pool, you can get by with a 
smaller base population, and you can always geneer marginal improvements and 
recessive fixes in later...

Sunbane was indeed at Western, which is in _London_, not Waterloo.
Waterloo is home to two universities, Wilfrid Laurier and my
alma mater, the University of Waterloo. For ghu\'s sake, don\'t
confuse them unless you want hordes of angry engineering students
descending upon you, singing school songs off key.

This mistake is fairly understandable though, as I though Stanford
was in Boston for the longest time...

a Battlecruiser...

400 to 800 ton craft are called "Cruisers". 5000 ton ships are the biggest
we can make, and even the best TL15 Z-class drives can only make these
5ktn craft go 2G and Jump-2.

I\'m writing, of course, about a TU that bases ship designs around
CT Book2 design rules. Add in the least possible quantities of
High Guard - bay weaponry, particle accelerator or fusion gun
turrets/barbettes, maybe even a launch tube for your 5ktn Fleet
Carrier. Armored hulls perhaps...but I like the drives from CT Book2,
I was never comfortable with Battleships that changed vectors
as nimbly as the most agile starfighter.

Imagine a Traveller universe where something about the nature of
jumpspace creates a 5ktn limit on what can go through the hole, and
a maximum stable power output for jump drives & reactionless
maneuver drives that limits how far these ships can jump, how fast they
can go. Jump-2/2G for 5ktn, Jump-4/4G for 3ktn(4ktn?) ships, Jump-6/6G
for smaller ships.

5000ton ships are Dreadnaughts, lumbering through space at 2G\'s,
able to carry bay weaponry but vulnerable to mass starfighter attacks.
A 6G, Jump-6 fleet intruder is possible at 2000tons, a deep striking
Cruiser. 400dtn system defense boats are something for a battlefleet
to fear.

5000dtns is also a limit for cargo ships. How many ships need to call
at Regina every day if the biggest one can only carry ~3500dtns of
cargo?

How do you invade a world if the best ship you can bring is a 5ktn
battleship with a 1ktn meson spinal and a couple of 100tn missile bays?
The best mobile thing the defender can use is also 5ktn 2G, but he can
have armed asteroid stations and starbases as big as he can build them.

It\'s not as gearheaded or intricate as later versions, nor are the results
as detailed. A universe like this would be more created for the players
than for the fleet commanders - the ships are of a more human scale.

Just some thoughts I\'ve been noodling around with...I sure would miss
using my 60ktn Azhanti High Lightning deck plans, though....

Mea Culpa, Ethan.  I *knew* that too, but brain farts happen.

When I first joined the TML, there was no centralized list-server.
Each member had to keep his/her *own* alias-list of all the other
TMLers and mail to that alias!  You can image the "Chinese Firedrill"(tm)

Thanks for that information; I did not know that.  Here in the San

give flying tours of the area.  I\'m planning on doing it sometime soon,
maybe this summer.  I don\'t know how old the planes are.

How long would it take for a black globe to absorb so much energy from
the atmosphere that it would overload the capacitors?  I think a very
long time.  

Don\'t forget that you can flicker the black globe and discharge energy
during the "off" part of the cycle.  This should make the air force of
the TL 7 society that you\'re surveilling very nervous -- here\'s
something showing up and disappearing from radar screens, and giving off
little bursts of energy.  "It looks like it exists in two phases, sir --
energy for a few nanoseconds, then mass for a few, then energy again.  I
don\'t know what the hell it is."

I don\'t remember whether you can see out of a black globe when it\'s on,
or only during the off phases, but it seems that a black-globe equipped
ship should be able to do some interesting and close-up research on
solar and gas giant atmospheres.

I think you\'re right, for the same reason that there is no "official"

   An example of what\'s inside:
    Orbital Station
   " The standard category Orbital Station has facilities for accommodating up
to 1,000 passengers and at least 500 work crew. Scshuttle service to the
planet below is available. Small craft are available for hire and a Type A
Free Trader will be available for hire on a roll of 7+. Other types of
commercial standard vessels will be available on a roll of 11+. Refined fuel,
water, and basic food supplies are always available. On a roll of 9+ luxury
foodsupplies are available. Spare parts for most types of small craft are
available and repair services for small craft are available on a roll of 7+."

   Needless to say, this goes on and on describing other size stations and
orbital ports (for construction) and the services at each. Also has hex maps
of various ground stations. Anyway, good reference to get things started.

Per both CT and FF&S this happens extremely fast -- for practical purposes you
can assume that entering atmosphere with a black globe will destroy the black
globe generator and the capacitors, and will probably cripple or destroy the
ship.  Assuming you place limits on throughput (which FF&S does, CT doesn\'t but
also doesn\'t deal with time scales where it matters) a thousand ton ship moving
at 100 meters/second will absorb a couple of gigajoules per second, which will
overload it extremely quickly.

*Half-life of Ideas

There is often a lag of five generations (~137 years) between the 
introduction of an idea and the reaction to it.  Thus, Terra is 
incorporated into the Imperium in 588, rejects it (forming the Solomani
Autonomous Region) in 704 (116 years), gets reintegrated in 950 (246 
years) and goes to war with it (Solomani Rim War) in 990 (50 years). 
The average is 134 +/- 71 years.


*Lifetimes of Unitary States

	first failure	repair		second failure
10%	90 years	25 years	105 years
50%	160 years	70 years	185 years
90%	250 years	130 years	290 years
95%	300 years	155 years	330 years

That is, 50% of all empires experience their first major breakdown within 160
years of founding; 95% will fail within 300 years.  It takes 70 years for 50%
to get going again; 50% will have failed a second time within 185 years.

The Rebirth period only lasted for 250 years (622-879) for the Imperium
instead of 400.

The Empire II is usually of foreign derivation (Mongol/Manchu for the 
Chinese, Ottoman Turk for the Middle East).  This model may apply to 
the Ziru Sirka as well (with the Rule of Man as Empire II), but there\'s
not enough internal chronology to make the comparison.
	

*Economic Cycles

In 1945, Dewey and Dakin proposed that the US economy is dominated by 
the superimposed effects of four cycles:

41-month:  prices of many commodities, prices of many securities, 
	production of many businesses

	Min	Max
	Mar 86	Feb 88
	Aug 89	Jul 91
	Jan 93	Dec 94
	Jun 96	May 97
	Nov 99	Oct 00
	Apr 03	Mar 04
	Sep 06	Aug 07

9-year:  wholesale prices, common stocks, many industrial series

	Min	Max
	1977/8	1982
	1986/7	1991
	1995/6	2000
	2004/5	2009

18.3-year:  real estate, building activity, common stock lows, many
	industrial series

	Min	Max
	1970	1980
	1989	1999
	2007	2017

54-year:  wholesale prices, possibly production and interest rates

	Min	Max
	1736	1763
	1790	1817
	1844	1871
	1898	1925
	1952	1979
	2006	2033
	2060	2087
	2114	2141

This last is the interesting one - major wars occur at the midpoints on
the graph (up or down), minor ones occur at the m
inima.  This suggests 
that the 1st Interstellar War (2113) was abetted by economic factors.

Also notice that all four cycles are due to bottom out sometime around
2005-7.  If the theory holds, this could be a particularly ugly period
- - Cyberpunk, anyone?


*Rank-Size Distribution of Cities

In a mature country, the population of cities is approximately equal to
the population of the largest city divided by each city\'s rank number.

That is, if the largest city has population P, the second largest will
have population P/2, the third P/3, and so on.  Note that this series
does not converge - you have to set a cut-off somewhere.

In colonial countries, the distribution is dominated by a single,
primate city (usually the capital).  The remainder are just small towns
by comparison.

Coming in at escape velocity, with the globe full on, not very long.  Maybe a 
minute at the outside.  You\'re taking both the kinetic energy of the impact at 
several kilometers/sec times the *MASS* of the ship at impact with the 
atmosphere.  You\'re also taking on energy from friction of the atmosphere if 
you \'clip\' the atmosphere.

Even at a 50% duty cycle, it would be hard to discharge *ALL* the energy you 
soak up with a black globe while manuvering in atmosphere.  You\'d have to 
discharge every energy weapon at once, overloaded, to make a dent.

Black globes are impenetrable to *ALL* energy in *BOTH* directions.  That 
includes visible light.  And do you *REALLY* want to try and take that black 
globe into a *STAR*?????????????????  You go ahead; I\'ll sit back a hundred

  It\'s probably not a big deal either way, as only a major naval element
can exploit the presumed vulnerability (although with thrusters anyone
can deploy a 0.01 C empty beer bottle for yucks). Several hundred meters
of rock (preferably under an atmosphere?) goes a long way towards keeping
non-shipyard assets safe, though.

It is a shame the black globes were so limited, compared to the Langston
Field from "The Mote in God\'s Eye" and associatedworks.  I thought it was
kind of interesting to pull picket duty in a star.  

Hmmm, perhaps that is where those pseky pirates have the hidden bases...

Bah, black globes are incredibly useful devices -- they have the magic power to
violate the second law of thermodynamics by turning heat energy into usable
power.  This has quite remarkable consequences for such things as heat
signature (which is utterly ignored in the rulebook, of course).

To be more reasonable, black globe generators should probably have a
temperature and emit black-body radiation, though that kind of limits their
value as uber-stealth devices.

  Perhaps more interestingly, "pirates" have an extra income option if
the state that they\'re in is well-regulated (i.e., ships are registered,
tracked, and searched at least occasionally). As the pirate ships don\'t
dare go to ports (either at all or regularly, depending on campaign 
variables) they can rack up some business helping other criminals evade
ship tracking controls.

  So if a trader is going to not be "randomly" searched because its\'
itinerary indicates that it can\'t have gone anywhere to pick up naughty
items, you can help it out for a fee by passing it said illegal goods.
The pirate vessel (more likely, piracy support unit, if available) isn\'t
concerned with tracking efforts, as it couldn\'t survive a search (or even
possibly a patrol enquiry) in such a regime (potentially, anyway).

Task Force Games has a pretty straightforward game of space combat
called Star Fire. It uses fixed jump points for star travel - your ship
flies to a jump point, it passes through the stable wormhole that
connects that jump point permanently to a similar jump point at
another star.

Jump point locations were rather random. An interesting scenario
had the jump point several hexes (game scale escapes me) under
the surface of a Red Giant star. The stellar matter at that radius was
so thin the ships could fly through it, though if their force shields went
down from enemy fire the energy from the star would start to burn the
ship away. The point of the scenario was for one group to escape
through the jump point to safety.

Though I\'d wonder if such a jump point would have a continuous fountain
of stellar material blowing through it at the other side...might look kind
of neat.

ObTrav: this has probably been covered before, but just how much
heat can a Traveller starship withstand? If I\'m slingshotting around the
local star to get to 100d, how close is too close?

New Class of Starlike Objects Found


        A.P. INDEXES: TOP STORIES | NEWS | SPORTS | BUSINESS |
TECHNOLOGY | ENTERTAINMENT 


        Filed at 1:44 p.m. EDT

        By The Associated Press

        SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Astronomers say that gas spheres glowing
faintly in the dark of
        space and slowly cooling represent a new class of stellar
objects that may be the most
        common bodies in the Milky Way. 

        The California Institute of Technology astronomers said they are
calling the new objects
        L dwarfs and that the discovery will force revision of a
century-old system of classifying
        stars based on their chemistry and temperature. 

        J. Davy Kirkpatrick told the American Astronomical Society that
he and his colleagues
        discovered that some objects have a surface temperature three
times lower than the
        sun, a mass about a third of the sun and a diameter about like
Jupiter. 

        ``They are radically different and require a new
classification,\'\' said Kirkpatrick. He said
        they have distinctive temperature and chemistry. 

        ``These look like stars,\'\' said I. Neill Reid, part of the Cal
Tech team, ``but they just
        haven\'t managed to get enough mass together to start nuclear
fusion,\'\' the process that
        makes stars shine. 

        The objects are thought to have heated as they formed from the
gravitational
        accumulation and compression of gas. But this heat is slowly
fading, like dying embers.
        A star is created when the mass is great enough to compress the
gas to a point that
        fusion fires are ignited in its core. 

        Kirkpatrick said the team discovered 20 of the objects in a
survey of just 1 percent of
        the sky out to about 100 light-years from the sun. A statistical
projection of this
        number suggests that about half of every 2,000 stellar points of
light in the Milky Way
        galaxy may, in fact, be these L dwarfs, he said. A light-year is
the distance light travels
        in a year in a vacuum, about 5.8 trillion miles. 

        ``L\'s are the most common type of objects,\'\' said Kirkpatrick.
``There are just about as
        numerous as all of the other types combined.\'\' 

        By splitting the light into colors, or spectrum, astronomers can
determine the distinctive
        chemistry of stellar objects. This allows them to calculate the
temperature and mass of
        the objects. 

        Using this technique, astronomers since 1817 have divided stars
into classes based on
        the spectral characteristics. At first, the star classes were
designated alphabetically, A
        through M, but some were dropped due to duplication. And in
1901, a Harvard
        astronomer, Annie Jump Cannon, arranged the remaining classes by
temperature, from
        hottest to coolest. 

        Cannon\'s work produced a sequence of classes identified, in
order, as OBAFGKM.
        Astronomy students have been taught for decades to remember this
sequence by using
        the mnemonic ``Oh, be a fine girl (or guy), kiss me.\'\' 

        Kirkpatrick said that since the object his team has discovered
is the coolest, it would
        follow the M class the spectral sequence of objects. He proposed
that they carry the
        letter L, creating a new hottest-to-coolest sequence of
OBAFGKML. 

        For the mnemonic, Kirkpatrick suggests ``Oh, be a fine girl/guy,
kiss my lips.\'\' 

        Kirkpatrick said the spectra of six of the new objects show the
presence of lithium. This
        reading disappears if objects are cooler than 4.5 million
degrees Fahrenheit and too cold
        to ever achieve the nuclear fusion process of stars. This means
they are actually not
        stars, but ``brown dwarfs,\'\' a type of failed star that is
bigger than a planet, but smaller
        than a star such as the sun. 

        Over millions of years, the L objects will cool, like dying
embers, and eventually become
        too cold to be detected from Earth, he said.

The cost of the military infrastructure, as opposed to just the power

ie.  what percent of the military budget is spent in support of the ships
and defense forces that actually are launched.

that here on Earth in the 20th Century, if you analyzed exactly what goods
were being carried by traders roughly equivalent to Traveller Free Traders
and Merchants (maritime vessels) you would find that much (The Majority?)
of the \'cargo\' space available is used for the following;

Oil
Grain/Rice/Oats
Iron Ore & Steel
Bauxite & Aluminum
Wood (for Construction or Paper)
Cars

It seems to me that, if I were building a random trade table for, say,
Boston, I would have a much higher incidence of Steel (scrap or new) than,
for example, Bananas.   would want the entry for "Steel, Finished" to be
more likely by an order of magnitude than "Bananas, Frozen" in a Traveller
analogous table.

This leads to several Questions;

1). What is Superdense Made Of?

Being the material of choice for most starships, the base material
(pre-compression) is going to be a popular import, and, probably, either
Iron Ore or some other abundant mineral resource available lots of places
(else SD would be much more expensive than crystaliron).  I think it could
be Carbon (coal, et al), Bauxite (transparent aluminum anyone?) or some
polymer (Petroleum?).

2). What other high bulk materials would make up the majority of imported
cargos in the Imperium?

Basic foodstuff is a good candidate.  Many worlds are highly populated,and
unable to grow food without hydroponics and such, but I have heard some
people say that it is downright impossible to feed a planet with imported
food, so maybe only gourmet specialties would be traded.

Unrefined or partly refined minerals from worlds with no refining at all I
think would be rare.  Anyone with a bit of business sense can see the
advantage of refining before shipping I think.  So \'refined\' mineral
resources would be the norm, although these materials may be in a state
midway between the harvested form and the final product (plastic sheets,
refined iron ore).

Petroleum has value well after it\'s value as a fuel is no more.  Solvents,
plastics, lubricants, etc etc.  And I seem to recall that Petroleum is a
biproduct of vegitation, and so requires a (relatively) habitable planet
(or previously habitable planet) to be present.  This means to me that not
any planet will have petroleum, leading to it being a valuable trading
commodity, either raw (partly refined) or finished.

Most construction would try to use indigenous materials to save on cost.
This means to me that concrete or wood will not be on the "most imported"
list.

Any other  thoughts?

Pete

Langston fields were only carried by military ships in the Empire.  There is 
no real difference between military & nonmilitary ships in the Mote system.

And I still think that black globes destabilise game balance, therefore they 
should be *rarer* than hen\'s teeth, like they were canonically in CT.  Only 
2000 globes were found by the Imperium, *all* of them reserved for the 
Imperial Navy on an experimental \'this *might* or might *not* work\' basis.  
Crude copies were built at a couple research stations, taking advantage of 
advanced technology that hasn\'t filtered down to the Imperium yet.  But the 
underlying physics had *yet* to be discovered.

Like I say, rare gadgets that upset the balance.

They absorb everything.  This would mean black body radiation, too.  Of

The fact that they absorb everything doesn\'t mean that they don\'t emit
blackbody radiation -- a perfect blackbody absorbs everything too.  It is the
screen itself which would emit blackbody radiation, and nothing in \'absorbs all
energy which hits it\' disallows emitting energy as well.

I see starports as being designed one by one to meet local
needs (TL, types of ships that dock there, amount of traffic,
local design philosophy, local cultural views on efficieny
vs. cost. vs beauty, etc.).  A lot of this is going to vary
from port to port.

that ship and craft development became more refined for the extras, and
that\'s what I wanted out of the MT books.  I didn\'t care for the mass

At the same time, however, the Imperium is going to have a set of
standardized specifications on what a Class C starport is, or a Class B,
etc...  And since your world is judged by your starport, you are darn well
going to try and meet those specifications.

So, if the Grand Duke\'s mother\'s brother\'s son\'s daughter is seeing someone
who makes non-slip seats for the starport lounge stools, and that gets put
into the standard for what constitutes a Class A facility...

Politics is such a wonderful thing.  ;)

Well, in 1996 the total reciepts for the US Government was 1.46 trillion
dollars.  The Department of Defence got $253 billion, or about 17%

Of that amount: 

$66.669 billion went to personnel
$88.629 billion went to operations and maitainence
$48.912 billion went to procurement
$36.561 billion for research, testing, and development
$6.684 billion for military construction

So about 19% of the modern US military budget goes to procurement of new
equipment.  This is about 3% of the total US budget.

>	* NASA

NASA has an annual budget of $13.882 billion.  The World Almanac doesn\'t
break that down any further.

<sigh>

From High Guard 2nd Edition, Pg 31:

\'Force Field Generators\' project a spherical energy-absorbing shell around a 
ship, and are therefore known as black glove screens.  All energy, whatever 
its form, that contacts the black globe is absorbed and diverted to the ship\'s 
capacitors, doing no damage.

OK, *all* energy hitting it goes to the capacitors.  This leaves *NOTHING* for 
black body radiation.

My point was that you would avoid the wondrous violations of the second law of
thermodynamics if you changed this -- I am aware of what the text says.  Note
that the text _still_ doesn\'t disallow black globes emitting blackbody
radiation.  That just means that not only can power be diverted from the
generator into the capacitors, it can also flow the reverse direction.

Of course, Traveller isn\'t terribly averse to violations of thermodynamics in
any case, contragrav and thruster plates both violate the first law of
thermodynamics, and nuclear dampers _may_ violate thermodynamics, though it is
slightly more difficult to tell (anything which actually changed the behavior
of the strong nuclear force would _probably_ cause changes in the mass of
nuclei.  However, in theory merely adjusting the dropoff in strength beyond the
normal size of a nucleus would influence fusion and radioactive decay).

Post the sheets and post the URL, and I\'ll grab them and look at
converting them to Excel 97 (and/or any other format that E97 can

Somewhere I read that, to sustain survivability ( same evolutionary

The fewer the people, the greater the possibility that they will

We\'re talking *ANCIENTS* class physics here, *NOT* Imperial.  And where does 
it say that the power can flow in reverse?

How so?  CG and nuclear dampers wouldn\'t violate the laws since you have to
pump energy into them in order for it to work.  These are *not* perpetual
motion machines.  You can turn them on and off at will and you *WILL* lose the
energy you feed them while they\'re in use.

No, they violate conservation of energy because the amount of energy gained is
greater than the amount of energy spent.  If you create a wheel with CG lifters
strung in a circle around it, and turn the lifters on when they\'re on the side
which is going up, off when on the side going down, and connect the wheel to a
generator, you\'ll start producing more energy than you use when the rotation
speed of the wheel exceeds about 10 meters/second.  Similar problems occur for
thruster plates (nuclear dampers are more complicated).

You\'re ignoring the friction of the wheel assembly both on the shaft *and* the 
electromagnetic kickback of the generator, not to mention the heat generated 
in this process.  Plus, you\'ll lose some energy when the switches you use to 
turn the lifters on & off make and break.  They\'re called \'sparks\'.

    'body' => 'Andrew Moffatt-Vallance was kind enough to share some notes on his
campaign; one of the comments he made got me to thinking.

One of the major problems of space colonization in the real world may be
disease.  Every habitat is effectively its own ecosystem; the humans that
live there will be subjected to mutating strains of virus and bacteria,
developing immunities as they go along.  So far, this is not very different
than the current situation (think "flu and cold season"), although the
higher background radiation may cause higher mutation rates than on Earth
(I can\'t say, I\'m not a biologist).

The problem arises when humans from one habitat encounter those from
another.  Now, unless stringent isolation procedures are followed, each
population is exposed to the diseases of the other, for which they have no
developed immunities.  The longer the populations have been separated, the
greater the differences in their endemic diseases, and the more likely that
something really nasty has developed (to which the carrier population is
largely immune).

In the Traveller of the Third Imperium, anyone who travels probably has
been given some permanent, broad-spectrum anti-bodies (maybe through
limited genetic engineering) to ensure that they don\'t carry strange
diseases from one world to another.  It is probably so routine a procedure
that it\'s never mentioned, and the cost of updating the vaccine subsumed in
the price of life support (if required).  Even so, there are sure to be
accidents, missed inoculations, or resistant strains every once in a while
- - the fodder of a fertile GM\'s mind.

But consider the impact of the first contact with Terrans on the Ziru
Sirka.  The Vilani have no endemic diseases:  anything that could prey on
humans died off hundreds of thousands of years ago (for want of reservoir
populations of compatible animals).  Their biological sciences are almost
totally atrophied as result; the Vilani language probably does not contain
a word for "vaccination".  Then all at once, they get exposed to the full
spectrum of Terrestrial micro-life.  The Black Plague, the effects of
syphilis and smallpox on the Native American populations, and the worldwide
influenza epidemic of 1918 together pale by comparison.

Historians have often wondered at the ease with which the puny Terran
forces toppled and eventually usurped the vast First Imperium.  The method
may have been as simple as that used by Cortez against the Aztec:  move
into the vacuum that the diseases you carry have created.  (To his credit,
Andrew posits that the Terrans, aware of the problem, would attempt to
assist, thus limiting the deaths to 5-10% of the population.  I\'m not so
sure this is even possible, much less that it would have been feasible
under the circumstances.)

 Wow. Beaten to my own webpage reference...

I am slowly detailing the sector for my own use, and sharing with the web.
Berka (over at zhodani.org) did two subsectors a while back, and has just
recently massaged them to fit the official dotmap. Between us the whole sector
won\'t take long. HOWEVER! If anyone has developed a chunk of Foreven and wants
it to be part of this unofficial collaboration, let me know.

 Imperiallines saw two issues published and a double issue (3/4) proofed but
never published...

While the things you mention do use up energy, a standard Traveller CG
device can be turned into a free energy machine in a gravity field.

Take two heavy weights, say a ton or so.  Put sufficient grav modules on
them to negate gravity.   Put them on a 2 meter rod suspended by the
middle.  Float them on a magnetic spindle, so you have minimal friction,
and do this in a vacuum.

Each turn of the wheel involves 2000Kg dropping two meters.  From P=mgh,
this gives off 40Kj per spin.   According to FF&S2, a grav module reqires
700W/KN, and we will need to have 10KN negated, thus 7KW of input energy.

So, one rotation per second produces roughly six times the power needed to
run the machine.  Even the most inefficient system for making contacts,
pulling power out, and so on, is going to be a net positive for this device.

Similar calculations with thruster plates show how they become pure energy
machines fairly easily.

Niven wrote about how a teleporter at a pole can be used to make a free
reactionless drive or doomsday device.

High tech goodies usually have little problems like this, that we all agree
to ignore, much like the causality problems produced by ump drives.

Another approach to achiveing this effect would be to have a TU - or
at least a sector - with quite low populations (none higher than 7 o r
perhaps  8.) A pop-7 world would have about MCr 100,000 of fleet - 
about 100,000 tons - and if they had several client worlds to defend,
probably their biggest fleet units would be in the 5000 ton range.
Add in a lot of zero-pop worlds with only gas giants and you can have
quite interesting military sitatuins - and ones in which a PC-sized ship
actually has military value. I think if I ever run a campaign it will
be in such a universe.

(Although it\'s also consistent with a much smaller fraction being
L/brown dwarfs, though; the uncertainties are big. Note that these
aren\'t fundamentally a new *discovery* so much as an ackowledgment
that we finally have enough brown dwarfs that we need a way of 
classifying them.

Now, does anyone know the name of the one for the Sword Worlds?????<

I figured as a balkanised state they would have several. Even a medium
sized modern nation usually has two or three; ghod knows how many the
superpowers have. Now, multiply that by about twenty planets.

It\'s no wonder they\'re stuck in a single backwater subsector. They keep
assassinating and sabotaging each other. Sometimes they do it to 
other Sword Worlds as well as themselves. :)

Of course, there IS a single overarching agency.

It is called... AARGH! <clutches throat - falls to floor as if poisoned.>

Just one little problem here, did you know that JG\'s stuff cannot be sold
in the US.  Walt Bludsoe still "owes" the IRS lots & lots of cash.  So how

The following features/bugs have been added/fixed:

* Fixed Missile Thrusters
* Fixed HEPlaR fuel consumption for missile drives.
* Fixed IR signature for low-power scenarios.
* Fixed the beam pointer on Laser 1.
* Fixed a problem with bridge armor.
* Changed pricing for Advanced Nuclear Drives.
* Changed the nuclear damper turrets and sandcasters to allow grouping into

* Added Point Defence batteries for lasers - these add the ability for
lasers to have extreme ROFs for 1 minute.
* Added the CUSP - Combat Universal Ship Profile. This profile is intended
to be used in Bruce Macintosh\'s starship combat system. It can be found on
the combat page. Note that this is potentially an early version of the CUSP,
as Bruce has not finalized his combat system. But, it gives a good idea of

<<One of the major problems of space colonization in the real world may be
disease.  Every habitat is effectively its own ecosystem; the humans that
live there will be subjected to mutating strains of virus and bacteria,
developing immunities as they go along.  So far, this is not very different
than the current situation (think "flu and cold season"), although the
higher background radiation may cause higher mutation rates than on Earth
(I can\'t say, I\'m not a biologist).>>

I agree.  Ecosystems are two way streets.  What humans may introduce into
the ecosystem may cause the ecosystem to "fight" back.  T-cells, antibodies,
poisonous/noxious plants, etc may begin to prey on the "fragile" human or
non-human body.  Higher levels of background radiation could cause genetic
variances to increase, but these usually take eons for natural selection to
positively act upon.  Somantic effects would be readily noticable.  Most
genetic effects would be negative and cause death of the individual
organism, either in the womb or within one generation after its birth.  For
natural selection to take a positive hold, the organism has to survive
through the third or fourth generation.  For single celled organisms, this
can be a short as a day or even hours.  Think of the influenza virus.  This
"organism" survives thousands of genetic changes within a matter of days,
because its nature is to recombine its DNA with that of its host, be it a
chicken, pig or human.

<<The problem arises when humans from one habitat encounter those from
another.  Now, unless stringent isolation procedures are followed, each
population is exposed to the diseases of the other, for which they have no
developed immunities.  The longer the populations have been separated, the
greater the differences in their endemic diseases, and the more likely that
something really nasty has developed (to which the carrier population is
largely immune).>>

IMTU I handled this by stating that those planets inhabited by the major and
minor races were "habitable" by all races.  These planets had no known
predatory factors on any of the races, thus the spread of the races to where
they are "today."  If you subscribe to the theory that the Ancients were the
ones that spread all of the Major Races, (and why not the Minor Races) then
they would have been smart enough to place the races on habitable planets
and not inhabitable ones.  Never mind that some planets might be
"inhospitable" implying a challenge to live on.

<<In the Traveller of the Third Imperium, anyone who travels probably has
been given some permanent, broad-spectrum anti-bodies (maybe through
limited genetic engineering) to ensure that they don\'t carry strange
diseases from one world to another.  It is probably so routine a procedure
that it\'s never mentioned, and the cost of updating the vaccine subsumed in
the price of life support (if required).  Even so, there are sure to be
accidents, missed inoculations, or resistant strains every once in a while
- - - the fodder of a fertile GM\'s mind.>>

I agree.  Again, a little hand waving here.  By TL 13, I figured all races
had developed to the point to eliminate the need for anti-body innoculations
because diseases had been eliminated.  This puts all races into the catagory
that the pre-Columbian natives were in.  90% of the deaths in the aboriginal
tribes of the Americas were due to "common" diseases of the times.  Flu,
measles, pox, as well as syphillus and gonnorhea.

<<But consider the impact of the first contact with Terrans on the Ziru
Sirka.  The Vilani have no endemic diseases:  anything that could prey on
humans died off hundreds of thousands of years ago (for want of reservoir
populations of compatible animals).  Their biological sciences are almost
totally atrophied as result; the Vilani language probably does not contain
a word for "vaccination".  Then all at once, they get exposed to the full
spectrum of Terrestrial micro-life.  The Black Plague, the effects of
syphilis and smallpox on the Native American populations, and the worldwide
influenza epidemic of 1918 together pale by comparison.>>

Refresh my memory.  At what point did the contact take place and at what TL
were the Terrans at?  Could these losses really be unintentional?

<<Historians have often wondered at the ease with which the puny Terran
forces toppled and eventually usurped the vast First Imperium.  The method
may have been as simple as that used by Cortez against the Aztec:  move
into the vacuum that the diseases you carry have created.  (To his credit,
Andrew posits that the Terrans, aware of the problem, would attempt to
assist, thus limiting the deaths to 5-10% of the population.  I\'m not so
sure this is even possible, much less that it would have been feasible
under the circumstances.)>>

I think the Terrans would have been a little more mercenary, what with their
attitudes of the origin of the human race.  I even think they would have
purposely attempted some biological warfare, using some "Typhoid Mary"
carriers planted within Vilani society, if not outright biological
bombardment.  Could this be the reason that the Vegans "dislike" the Solomani?

Actually I would argue that Free Traders and (small) Merchanters more
closely corespond to Independant Truckers in the 20th. Either way 99.9% of
shipped goods is freight, done for contract, not cargo, done for
speculation.

>It seems to me that, if I were building a random trade table for, say,

You have to remember that the trade tables do not necessarily reflect the
major production of a region, but rather what can be picked up on
speculation.
The production of such mass goods as Steel are done to schedule and with
fixed production. In a steel producing region they are likely to have
existing large contracts with the big longhaul merchanters. I would say it
would be unlikely that you would be able to pick up an extra, speculative
load of Steel. Freight, certainly, if a big company has more than they can
ship they are most likely to sub-contract out delivery. They are unlikely
to just sell it off. They have an established channel for delivery. Like
the way Tukera has the wine market sewn up on Zila.
Now with something that isn\'t a major production for the area, like
bananas, there is a greater chance that someone received an overshipment,
or just couldn\'t get rid of it, and wants to dump it. They couldn\'t sell it
here so there is no point in them freighting it elsewhere. Better to just
sell it to some poor sap and be happy with the cash.
So I\'m happy with a trade table with wide ranging goods on it sometimes
drifting into the bizzare.

>1). What is Superdense Made Of?
I\'ve always assumed it was collapsed steel.

>2). What other high bulk materials would make up the majority of imported

I kind of like the MT divisions: raw materials, processed materials,
finished goods, (information).
On one segment you ship iron ore/ingots. On the next you ship sheet/bar
steel. On the last you ship park benches.

>Basic foodstuff is a good candidate.
Unless you have massive government subsidies this gets a bit expensive. It
costs you about .75Cr to ship an orange 6 jumps. For a special good (i.e.
like a candy bar, not like caviar) that\'s supportable, but for a boal of
oatmeal, that\'s a bit more. But, then, if the planet has loads of exports,
the government\'s income on exportation tax would be put to good use
subsidising imported goods.

>Unrefined or partly refined minerals from worlds with no refining at all I
>think would be rare.  Anyone with a bit of business sense can see the
>advantage of refining before shipping I think.
Unless you have a low tech planet who are good at digging the iridium ore
from the ground but lack the highly industrialised processes to refine it.
It isn\'t a simple as just importing a refinery somewhere in the outback.
There are a whole ream of tiertiary industries that have to be present to
support any involved industrial process.
I wouldn\'t rule out ore.

>Petroleum has value well after it\'s value as a fuel is no more.
But it will only occur on planets who have had life for millions of years.
I don\'t think that\'s too common in the canonical traveller universe. In my
own game there are none, and you can\'t get petroleum naturally anywhere. It
is still a useful and necessary commodity, and "cracking stations" existing
in orbit around gas giants. Taking methane and cracking it up to longer
length carbon chains (the opposite of refining). Plastic is used on luxary
goods due to its expense and rarity.

>Most construction would try to use indigenous materials to save on cost.

>list.
Hey, look at just a sample of planets. How many of them have the
gravity-atmosphere-hydrosphere mix likely to produce forests? Not many.
Wood, though, is a renewable resource. The planets that are able to support
forests are often under inhabited, by Earth standards. It could be that
vast stretches are just forest that get harvested every decade or so.
(Imagine a huge, high-tech combine harvester scything through the woods!)
Concrete, well, you just need rock. Mind you, there was this guy from
Atlanta who visited me in Ireland and was amazed at the wealth of the
farmers as they could all have stone walls. Eventually I worked out that
there just aren\'t any quarries near Atlanta and raw rock is expensive and,
thus, fashionable. Could be planets like that.
You also need lime for Concerete. Limestone, like oil, is originally
bio-derived.  Lots of planets aren\'t going to be so maybe it will be a big
import. (I see a slightly sturdier combine harvester stripmining
limestone...)

Yes it does. Unfortunately I don\'t think you can change that significantly
without more or less destroying the OTU. I\'ve tried fiddling with the
numbers, but if you make ships much cheaper, you increase the number of
them, don\'t you? One scheme I\'ve contemplated was to turn the universe
three-dimensional and make the Imperium about 100 parsecs deep, essentially
increasing the number of systems by 100, but without increasing the number
of inhabited systems significantly (I would distribute the canonical star
systems across the depths of the Imperium and link major ones with
intermediate way stations). I\'d then decrease the cost of civilian ships
by a factor 10 while keeping military ships about the same (I haven\'t
figured out just how to justify that. Perhaps making armor really expensive
but much tougher (having a chance of surviving nuclear contact missiles,
perhaps?).) Anyway, as you can hear it would be a monumental task and
wouldn\'t really be Traveller.

What I\'d really like was some way to make a cheap starfaring ship that
wouldn\'t be suitable for regular trade. You see, it wouldn\'t matter to
the _players_ if the characters had to spend a month in deep space
between each planetfall, because it wouldn\'t take any longer in real
time. But what? A cheap jump drive that misjumped (but always safely)
every once in a while? A really cheap warp drive requiring really low power
that was slower than 1 parsec/week? Unfortunately any cheap ship would
be able to carry freight cheaper than a normal jumpship unless it was
significantly slower. And once the characters have to spend _many_ months,
or even years, in space between planetfalls, the aging rules beging to make
a difference to the players.

Assuming that viability depends on genetic variability, the figure that
matters is "Effective Population Number" (N):

N = 4MF/(M+F)		[Kimura and Ohta, "Effective Population Number", 1977?]

where M and F equal the number of males and females, respectively.

Large differences in numbers of males and females reduce N towards the
lower number. Variation in average family size (number of offspring per
female), overlapping generations, and fluctuations in the population from
generation to generation also reduce N over time.

The "inbreeding coefficient" per generation (f) is given by:

f = 1/2N		[Franklin, "Evolutionary Change in Small Populations", 1980]

Animal breeders will accept f = 0.01, implying N = 50 for short-term
viability.

For long term viability, Franklin [ibid.] suggests N = 500.  "Below this
latter value, it is likely that genetic variance for complex traits is lost
at a significantly faster rate than it is renewed by mutation."

Animal breeders find that a population shows significant viability problems
when the inbreeding reaches 0.1, and may collapse altogether when it
reaches 0.5-0.6.  The number of generations (t) to reach this extiction
threshold also relates to N:

t ~ 1.5N		[Soule, "Thresholds for Survival:  Maintaining Fitness and
Evolutionary 			Potential", 1980]


To increase the effective population number, while the actual (census)
number remains constant, there are two basic strategies [Senner,
"Inbreeding Depression and the Survival of Zoo Populations"].  First, by
reducing the variation in family size as much as possible, the effective
population can be doubled over the random case.  The effective population
can also be doubled over the random case by control over breeding partners,
either through maximum avoidance of inbreeding or through deliberate
half-sibling or first cousin breeding (these last improve N even over max
avoidance of inbreeding, but only after ~16 generations).  The two
strategies overlap, so only one doubling is possible.  Needless to say, the
social impacts of either strategy on a human population are extreme.

Note that a bottleneck produced by ruthless culling may have the effect of
mitigating later inbreeding problems.  Grey wolf populations in Minnesota
seem to have experienced a severe bottleneck sometime in the past that
eliminated most (if not all) undesirable recessive genes. In one
experiment, breeders conducted brother-sister matings of grey wolves for
four generations without producing *any* bad recessives [presentation by
the Wolf Survival Group, Patuxent Wildlife Research Lab, 1986].

Not so. you are missing the point. Performance. Read what I wrote: _As

If someone can guarantee the same service for half the price, I doubt if
many businessmen will care how his equipment looks. As long as it is just
as reliable.

Can you think of an enforcement scheme that will 1) allow the authorities
to distinguish between two sets of pirates and 2) be substantially
cheaper if they do concentrate on just one set?

So what you\'re saying here is that if you\'re already paying for something

What if we restrict ourselves to measures that are economically sound (Ie.

stay realistic?

A simple question that I thought would be hypothetical: How many
make a viable breeding population? Christopher Thrash (thanks Chris!)
provides a solid answer (500), the source (genetics research and
zoo/animal husbandry breeding program studies) and variables that
could affect the numbers.

Obtrav: Now we know that a planet with a population code of less than
two (and even half or so of those) is not viable on it\'s own, barring
TL for genetic engineering. It\'s going to be someone else\'s outpost,
a permanent base for a changing ever-transient population, or will
be the remnants of a population that\'s dying out. We knew that about
small planets anyway, but it\'s nice to know that it\'s in the two range
instead of the 3+ range.

Anti-Hijack programs are not free, though their cost is minor...
my book isn\'t with me, Cr100,000? And while not free, the cost
might be included in the price of something else.

IMTU we haven\'t thought about software upgrades for computers.
Since the ship cost used to calculate annual maintenance includes
the cost of the computer, it stands to reason that getting the latest
version of Anti-Hijack would be included in the cost, if you already
had a version of it.

That would lead to a nasty, nasty place for a henchbeing of a Hijacking
ring to get a job: Computer Maintenance Technician at a starship annual
maintenance facility. 

Imperial Navy Intelligence Guy: OK Captain Freidland, here\'s the deal:
You get your annual maintenance done at this shipyard we\'ve been
suspecting in the rash of hijackings lately, two of our special forces
guys ride with you as Cargo Hand and Gunner for a month or two
until the hijackers strike. We want these guys alive for questioning,
so our men will have the equipment to capture them. Do nothing out
of the ordinary, or they\'ll abort and we\'ll never even know they were on
your ship. Understand?
Captain Freidland: OK, OK...as long as you keep your end of the
bargain and forget about those smuggling charges...

And I think there are Model/1 computers that might have trouble running
Anti-Hijack, Generate and Jump Navigation programs at the same time.
This is CT, of course - later versions of the game were written with
much more faith in the future of computers... :)

Incidentally, is \'1/3 the mass of the sun, with a diameter close to jupiter\' an

Oh, you distinguish between civilian and military grade weapons. Fair
enough. Just be aware that CT didn\'t. Also, you are projecting your own
ideas onto the OTU. Do you have any evidence that the Imperium see
personal defense forces as more of a threat than any pirate? Bearing
in mind that it is perfectly willing to allow mercenaries (albeit
licenced mercenaries) to control cruiser squadrons? And what is going
to prevent a merchant company from getting a mercenary licence for
their own protection forces, come to that?

Well, if it comes to that, interstellar merchant companies need licencing
by the Imperium too, so they too are indirectly controlled by the Imperium.

I don\'t get either the reference or the inference.

The _Al Morai_ route protectors were surplus _Gazelles_, which are armed

weapons no better than what the merchants have.

Of course they are. Just think of all the pirates that seem to be out
there! Only trouble is, it\'s a stone/paper/scissors argument. If all
merchants really are armed to the teeth, the poor pirate\'s cash flow
problem gets even bigger, since a single lucky shot can give him a
repair bill that\'ll wipe out years worth of profit.

<<Sound of me knocking my head against the wall>> For the umpteenth time:
I\'m perfectly aware of all, or a least most, canonical references, overt
or oblique, to piracy. Since my original thesis is that those references
do not make sense when compared to other, equally canonical, references
and rules, I don\'t accept them as proof that they make sense. Did you
get that? [And yes, this time I am being rude. It comes from having
written the exact same thing less than a week ago. Let me make myself
absolutely clear on this: _The existence of canonical references to
piracy does not prove that said references are consistent with other
canonical rules and references._].

Vilis took over Tanoose before those two planets became part of the
Imperium. Garda-Vilis had been a colony of Vilis for as long as they
had been Imperial planets.

Sure. Indeed, until and unless Andrew\'s excellent article about the Ine
Givar becomes canonical, that\'s all we know about the Ine Givar. They
were deliberately left as vague as possible to allow individual referees
to tailor tham as they saw fit. But that don\'t prove that it is a bad
idea. There are those who think Heaven is a bad idea.

Yes. The first time you recieve a starship as a benefit you get it with 40
years of payments still due. For every time you recieve it again you get
10 years\' payments knocked off. If you are lucky enough to recieve it 5
times, you own a 40 year old ship outright. And if he gets it 6 times I
suppose he\'d have an additional ship (with 40 years\' payments due)...

Yep. And if I was the Referee I\'d tell you: "OK, your character retires in
comfort. Give me the character sheet, I\'ll put it in with my other NPCs.
Now please roll a new character that will fit into the campaign I\'ve
designed."

IMO anything as valuable as a starship is something the Referee (and not the
character generation tables) hands out.

Well, that would depend on several assumptions. For instance, if the pirate
is in a position to sell his ship, his income as a pirate would have to be
bigger than the income he could get from just selling the ship and living
off the interest. That\'s why I\'ve repeatedly challenged any piracy
proponent to come up with a set of reasonable ground assumptions and
show me how a pirate could make a living.
 
>Ship Payments:  Even though corsairs are manufactured, I don\'t think
>there would be many pirates making payments...  :->

So why did the manufacturer build the ship in the first place? The very
fact that he did implies that he expected to sell it, which means that
he expected that someone would believe that he could make a living with
it. The buyer may have to pay the full cost up front, but that simply
transfers the problem from the bank to the owner.

>Life Support:  Only used when ship is in use.

And how do you propose that the pirates catch anything if the don\'t use
the ship?

>Maintenance:  Time based?  Usage based?  Regular "merchant" costs?

Usage based. Merchant costs if the pirates have a secure haven. Inflated
costs if they have to hide from the authorities. (Btw. I said in an
earlier post that for economic (not legal) purposes pirates and
privateers were much the same, but I was wrong there. Privateers can
get a better price on what they capture and they pay less inflated
costs.)  

>Living Expenses:  What standard of living?

CT life support costs are absolute. If pirates can get along with lower
life support costs then PCs ought to be allowed to as well.

If you can come up with a scheme that will make intelligence gathering
useful, sure.

Tell me your assumptions and I\'ll make a stab at working out something

True. Whoever wrote the TNS newsbriefs for Challenge goofed and mentioned
IRIS. In _Survival Margin_ GDW cleverly retrieved the ball by revealing that

a gigantic con job.

You\'re thinking about A. Bertram Chandler\'s book "Spartan Planet". Bujold\'s
book was named "Ethan of Athos" and the planet had no women at all. Most of
the action took place off planet, btw. Poul Anderson had one with women only.
I think it was called "Amazon Planet", but I may be thinking of a Mack
Reynolds story (though that planet was just a matriachy with as many men as
women).

Most of them actually can be fixed, but require some minor modifications to do
so.  CG and thruster plates actually aren\'t hard.

For contragravity, assume that the CG unit includes some form of high-
efficiency capacitor (which may or may not be usable as a normal battery) which
charges as the CG unit loses altitude, and discharges as it gains altitude.  If
the capacitor runs down, the CG unit will stop providing lift.  You can make a
CG unit capable of high orbit if you give it a capacitance of 13 megajoules per
kilonewton.

For a thruster plate, adding a fuel requirement of 0.00012 liters LHyd/kN/hour
(0.02 liters/week) turns a thruster plate into a matter converter instead --
this corresponds to light-speed emission of the fuel.  This has the side effect
that if you assume the typical 100 dt ship masses 500 tons and is capable of 1
G, it needs 1% of its tonnage to be hydrogen fuel to have an endurance of one
week (which _nicely_ matches the CT fuel requirements, though in CT they were
for the power plant, not the drive).

For black globes, much complicated math would be required to avoid violations
of thermodynamics, as long as you want absorbed power to be usable to power
your ship.  If black globe capacitance is just thermal storage or some such
this ceases to be a significant problem, though it is still a problem as long
as the black-body temperature of the globe is lower than the temperature of the
storage unit.

Isn\'t that 500 Effective Population (N) where N=4MF/M+F for long term
viablity, which assuming equal number of males and females gives a viable
popultion of 250, without best breeding, and with best breeding gives a
viable population of 126 (rounding up to get equal males and felames).

( in N=4MF/M+F
if M=F	then M+F = 2y
	and 4MF = 4 y squared
Thus N = (4 y squared) / 2y
Thus N = 2 y
Thus y = N/2 
QED )

If we go for short term viability with N = 50 then we get with best
breeding a viable population in the short term of 12, six male, 6 female
..... !!!!!!! (that\'s if I read Chris\'s post correctly and my maths is
still good)

Therefore Traveller code 2+ is viable in the long term, although very
restricted in breeding patterns, and Traveller code 1+ is viable in the
short term with extreamly restrictive reproductive patterns.

Right, so a speculative trade table may *not* need to weight in favor of
heavily produced products, since the table is intended to represent small
lots which are not being regularly shipped by a major line, or which are
surplus to the line.

...and products which could not possibly be mined/grown/made on a given
world (or at least, not without a lot of trouble) are in the process of
being transshipped from another world.

>>1). What is Superdense Made Of?

So refined Iron Ore and steel (scrap or otherwise) in raw form is a major
import of high tech Starport \'A\' and \'B\' owning planets.  As you say,
though, this can be considered moot for speculative trade tables.

I guess I want one level of detail lower than that (raw materials,
processed materials), I want the table to say "bar steel" or "iron ingots".
My original thought in this vein was that the bulk of (forex) "raw
materials" would be just a few specific items (Iron Ore, Petroleum, etc),
with the one or two items being 80% or the probability, while the other 20%
is many more items.

I wouldn\'t rule it out in certian circumstances, but if you have a source
of ore, why not bring in the refining equipment to convert it to smaller
tonnage?

The one reference I could find put the iron content of ore at 58% to 59%.
Processing this seemed to be a mostly magnetic and crushing operation to
convert to export-grade ore.  After that we get into coking and blast
furnaces, or alternate technologies just being explored (electrolysis,
plasma seperation, etc) to purify the iron.  I see no reason not to have
these operations moved to the site of the mining at high tech levels
assuming there are no impediments like a hostile local government.  The
one-time cost of constructing and starting up the plant is balanced by
saving in 40% of the shipping costs over the life of the mine.

Of course, as you say, free traders are picking up odd lots and non-large
scale cargos, so a lot of unrefined iron ore should not be out of the
question.

I disagree.  It seems as though there is life where there are oceans, and
atmosphere in Traveller.  The canonical Scouts (Book 6) temperature formula
aside (where all planets are either burning hot or frozen solid) the
original game seems to be a universe teeming with life - why else make
animal encounters so big a part of the game?  I was recently reading
through Leviathan (Adv. 6?) and of the 12 or so planets the players are
supposed to explore, I think 2 were Terra Prime and many of the others were
capable of supporting life without assistance.

In the Aramis subsector alone, from The Traveller Adventure, At least Zila,
Nasemin, Aramanx, Junidy, and Pysadi (off the top of my head) have native
life (some may be imported, but Zila, Junidy, and Nasemin definitely have
native life).

Well, several.  Again ignoring the Book 6 temperature thing and paying
attention to the text from adventures, not the numbers in the UPP (which do
not indicate the presence of trees, only their absence).  All the planets
above (except NAsemin, which is a water world) could support trees of some
kind.  In fact Pysadi has the Howood tree, prized for its great strength
(due to the natural incorporation of ferrous metals in the wood) and beauty.

My point, however, was that if a local material can be used at less expense
than importing one, the local material will predominate.  I didn\'t mean
that *no* imported materials would be used, just that they would not be
used for the majority of the building on the planet, and therefore would
not necesarily occupy the vast majority of the imported tonnage of a planet.

To wrap it up though, I think you are right in that the speculative cargos
available will be odd items; non-bulk, random lots of products not shipped
by the producer for some reason, or in excess of the usual production.

Since I think we rarely care about the content of freight (until it leaks
all over the cargo bay) I think there is only a need for the one table of
speculative cargos.

it could be explained built at a legitimate shipyard for legitimate
economic purposes before it started it\'s life of crime. I constructed it
with Book 2 CT rules, and assumed no cost for the special features
of variable electronic signature, variable transponder, and fake
extensible fins/modules to change visual profile - I assumed these
last items would be illegal after-market conversions, and had no way
of estimating costs for them anyway.

Construction was around MCr 167. I put a slow boat in the 160-ton
hold, and assumed it would travel with the slow boat\'s hold filled with
cargo. I added the boat because I figured this to be a frontier sector
armed merchant, and being unstreamlined in a low-facilities area
can really hamper you as a legit merchant.

Even with the hold filled, the low berths all in use and the two spare
staterooms occupied high passengers, she was clearing about 
Cr97000 a trip before bank payment...but bank payment was about
Cr350000 per trip.

This baby isn\'t making money on Jump-2 cargo haul runs between
regular ports. It needs some other niche, not necessarily covered by
the run-of-the-mill starship economics rules. For example:

Armed Trader: At what point is it more cost-effective to make a trader
that can escort itself? It\'s a comprimise between a Patrol Cruiser\'s
50 ton cargo bay and a Subsidized Merchant\'s 1G acceleration.
You need a special route with specific long-term dangers - perhaps
a trade route near or just inside the Vargr extents? Two of these ships
have more combat performance than a Sub Merchant escorted by a 
Patrol Cruiser, and carry 70tons more cargo besides. The cargo needs
a major markup, and thus must be vital - it has to travel for about Cr4000
a ton to make up the bank payment, plus extra for risk involved.
One (at least) of the Megacorps have secret manufacturing plants
beyond the Imperial border, I\'ve heard of one to make Psi-drugs.
They may want some special ships to move those cargos.

Exploratory Trader: A little expensive for a trading company, but still
doable - think "Leviathan Merchant Cruiser" on a smaller scale.
You\'d need a reason the area was thought profitable, and a reason
it was thought dangerous. One load of contragrav generators taken
to a TL7 first-contact planet can pay your bank payment for a 
long, long time...it would be enough to retire on, except that it
has to pay expenses for your half-dozen sister ships that didn\'t make
any big first-contact trading scores this quarter.

Fleet Auxiliary: Fast, self-escorting supply ship for bases and
on-station patrols in forward areas of dangerous zones. Gov\'t pays
the tab, probably owns the ship.

A war scare ends, bases fall into disuse or are supplied by normal
means, the Fleet Auxialiary is paid off. The region the Exploratory
Traders were making lots of money on is incorporated into the Empire,
with Imperial trade law, Imperial starport security, no profits for
such mavericks. The dangerous area you needed the Armed Merchant
for becomes too dangerous, or the trade route closes...you\'re at loose
ends. 

This strikes me as a ship made for a special purpose that could,
during the life of the ship, become untenable. The ship would be
paid off, or repossessed and auctioned, or perhaps even stolen
by a crew that got too many ideas from the holovids...it might just
go off on a trade mission and not return, at least not in recognizable
form.

As usual, when given a bit in a universe you can make up enough
other bits to let it make sense....<G>

I\'ve always assumed that the Joyeuse\'s intelligence and
counter-intelligence service was called simple La Surete\', although it
might have an official name as well (L\'Agence pour la Surete\' de l\'Etat,
for example).  It directs a fair amount of its energies to keeping track

I\'ve heard the name of the Sword Worlds Confederation intelligence

Actually, I think that decreasing the cost of ships only goes toward
*justifying* how there are so many ships in the Imperium under private
ownership. I kind of like the idea of winning the Millenium Falcon in a
high stakes poker game  ;)

Well, I don\'t see piracy as common so its not likely that you
will have multiple sets of pirates working in the same area.
Also, while I don\'t see a sure fire way as labeling a ship
as "pirate" I do think law enforcement would work by taking
clues to a possible identity of the ship and using those to
check ships that match the profile more closely (which is
common in law enforcement), so that if they are checking
ships like yours more closely, then you have more chance
of getting caught.  Finally, it might also be that higher
profile crimes step up all anti-piracy efforts.  Most
pirates don\'t do this because it makes things too hot for
them and when a loose canon comes along they all lay low
until he is gone.

No, I\'m saying they will pay _some_ cost and this is one of
the cheaper ones.  OTOH, I certainly wouldn\'t call it "wrong"
if not every ship had anti-hijack.

Pretty much.  You get into the question of short term vs long
term savings (does someone sell a 100,000 Cr program to buy
speculative cargo because he is only a 1/1,000, or maybe
1/10,000, shot of ever being pirated?) and just stupidity
(just like people don\'t buckle their set belts, he doesn\'t
have security because he can\'t be bothered).  But it would
be a lot closer.

Just like North America already had bacteria/viruses when the Conquistadors

and possibly lethal bacteria/viruses too...  Maybe not alot, but at least a

Don\'t know of many truckers out there driving trucks worth tens of millions.
The only millionarie trucker i know of is Karl Malone (of the NBA Utah Jazz)

MT Refs Manual says in the "Starfarers" sidebar (pg7) that "life is

The kicker is that not one of those planets had ever had humans living
on it for the last few million years or so, or had had close contact
with terrestrial mammalian immune systems for hundreds of millions
more...

Vilani probably classified planets where people sickened and died as
uninhabitable. This opens up _lots_ of real estate for the Terrans to
take in the old Ziru Sirka...once humans figured out _why_ all those
worlds were red zoned. Imagine the morale collapse when these upstarts
come barging in from terra and promptly settle and thrive in places that
killed your people in droves...

But this is getting me dragged closer to the whole damn \'Plague of
Duskir\' debate which dragged on almost as long as the $@#!% piracy,
feudal technocracy, and near-C rock threads, and I\'ll claw my way out of
it by saying it\'s canon, it happened, deal with it. (And NO it\'s NOT a
reason that the Rule of Man was TL46 or some such either!!!)

Discovering the remains of lost civilizations seems to be a common
enough theme in the OTU, I\'m sure some succumbed to disease.

Anne Mcaffrey, IIRC, wrote a series about ships with human brains - 
explorers in her Ship universe were almost certain to get at least one
life-threatening disease during their careers, and she had a scene where
an unexpected fungus (or insect bite, or something like that) wiped
out a reasearch station by causing temporary brain malfunction - the
people were so mentally debilitated that they couldn\'t open food packs
or turn on water taps, much less turn on commos to call for help.
She also had a scene where a bunch of interstellar barbarians were
infected with a nasty little gengineered flu, which had some bits
from Parkinson\'s disease mixed in with it.

IIRC, North America gave Europe several fun diseases - one of the
major sexually transmitted ones, a nice variety of dysentery...

There is one - spend a lot of time preventing hot ships from being sold,
and track them.  They are expensive enough and few enough that
concentrating on those who steal ships could be pretty efficient.  The
downside is that you will need inspectors on the places where hot ships
must gather, such as maintenance yards or starports.  These do not seem
dramatically fewer in number to me than the number of mainworlds to
protect, but this is open to argument.

I still feel that the best way to prevent this is to put a handful of
patrollers in each system, and to have standard procedures that make piracy
noticeable, but if you have religious objections to the minimal enforcement
needed to make mainworld trade absolutely safe, there are alternatives.
For example, one could posit that maintenance is very difficult, and thus
place inspectors on every class A and B port.

(NB - piracy far outside the mainworlds, piracy in in system travel, or
piracy taking place with the tacit agreement of the government/port owners
is clearly going to be possible.  In fact, I am reworking the trade rules
IMTU so that cargoes going to places not protected by patrollers have a
much higher margin to cover the risk, and thus are attractive to players.)

IMTU, the Imperium only promises trade protection to certain (logical)
areas, and attempting to set up shop outside those areas is what opens up
the outsystem to piracy.

One of the things I really liked about TNE was the ship table.  It both
accurately reflected the various contributions characters would make to a
ship, and allowed a little role-play in the character generation process.
Characters could opt to get a 40-year old rustbucket that was paid for, or
a shiny new ship that had a morgage heavier than 2 meters of Bonded
Superdense.

That were compatible with Terran-derived biochemistry?  Remember, disease
organisms are parasites, adapted to life in a particular host or hosts.

Actually, I find it hard to believe that *none* of the micro-organisms on
Vland were capable of preying on humanoids in the first place, but that\'s
what it says in this book right here....<shrug>

I\'ll buy that the Vilani probably had been exposed to some compatible
micro-life prior to first contact with the Terrans - from other, more
biologically successful minor human colonies, if nowhere else.

The point still remains (which I understand has been "done to death",
though that was before my time) that the Vilani and their clients had never
been exposed to the full panoply of critters-that-thrive-on-humans, and
(per canon) lacked the medical science to respond effectively.  This is a
recipe for disaster of galactic proportions.

Simple mistake:  total population still consists of males and females (2y =
N).

You are correct, however, that by careful management the actual population
could be as low as 26 (13 male, 13 female) for a few generations and still
maintain an effective population of greater than 50.  But as the species
survival guys put it:  that\'s the minimum, not the goal.

In fact, you could get by with even fewer if you had to, you simply run the
risk of dying out from inbreeding.  I\'ve seen figures to suggest that a
species can come back from a single generation as small as 4 (totally
unrelated) members, if it then builds back up to N > 500 as rapidly as
possible.  You lose about 25% of genetic variability in the process.

What is the annual tonnage of spacecraft constructed by Earth?
And what percentage of her world budget does she pay to build 
it and put it in place?

If one HANDWAVES that the annual space construction budget for 
Earth is 0.1% of the world budget, then in the Traveller world
we would have perhaps 20 billion credits (Imperial) to spend on
all aspects of space: communication, transport, military, trade.
This is new construction, not maintenance.  Maintenance is
covered elsewhere in the space budgets.

By the way, BCr20 (Imperial) is perhaps around US$57 billion.

BCr20 is, per year, for example:

	125 Free Traders	 MCr40/ea	BCr5
	 16 System Defense Boats MCr300/ea	BCr5
	 71 Liners		 MCr70/ea	BCr5
	 12 Patrol Ships	 MCr400/ea	BCr5
	---- ----
	224 ships, 78,800 tons: 1500 displacement tons per week.

But the Earth manages to build, per year:

	  <1 shuttles
	  X pieces of a space station
	  A bunch of satellites

So, are all of my assumptions wrong, or just some of them?
Okay, so Earth would have to buy these ships from a megacorp,
or at least buy the plans.  Does access to the Imperium really 
benefit the Earth to this stunning degree?  AMAZING!

In my opinion, worlds like ours shouldn\'t be able to build or
buy so many ships.  How many then?  Well, perhaps a factor of
10 less: 20 ships, 8000 tons per year, or 150 tons per week.
That makes a budget of 2 billion credits, commercial and
military combined.  Pretty sad... alright, maybe 4 billion
credits.  But 125 Free Traders?  Give me a break.

Also in my opinion, low TL worlds within the Imperium should get 
more than their money\'s worth (say, twice or 3x) in buying ships.
But not the incredible increase from "A bunch of satellites" to
"200 fast interstellar fusion+ ships, some with cool weapons too".

Of course, with those kind of benefits, I don\'t see how any world
would refuse an invitation to join the 3I.  I also can see how
the 3I really could stick it to member worlds and have them 
gladly go along.  I also can see why Earth would want to take over
the 3I.  Think of the royalties!

Also of course, with those kind of benefits I can see why worlds
usually have one government: the richest one buys a bunch of
ships and more or less owns the solar system.  Think about the
kinds of adventure hooks you have there for milieu E21... the
political and corporate wrangling...

Yes, but does it say that because a) the author intended the jump exit
points
to move with the the planet, b) he hadn\'t flashed on the fact that the
jump can last a variable amount of time and the planet is in motion wrt
other objects in the universe?  Add to this the fact that you certainly
don\'t have to jump to 100 diameters (you can jump to deep space)
and that variability in the exit point has been mentioned elsewhere
means that you definately don\'t have to come right out at 100 diams
and you may see why I\'m not so sure that this has been officially
decided.

Actually, we have never seen another biosphere.  I would be
very dubious about anyone who claims that virus from that
ecosystem would have to be genetically similar enough to
infect humans.  It is, to me, quite plausible that
recontact with the ecosystem they evolved out of exposed
the Vilani to virus that they had never had to deal with
(or hadn\'t had to deal with in a hundred thousand years).

Bacteria are a different story, but that just resticts the
plague to a viral one.

Michael, IMTU the players can update their ship\'s computer 
databases/library at any A or B starport (it comes as part of the 
general "package" so I don\'t charge them for it).  This gives me the 
opportunity to relay TNS information to them ("while sitting around 
reading the latest TNS downloaded from your last stop you notice that 
...").

It also alows me to remind them that a lot of background information 
(which  their characters should know even if the players don\'t) is 
available from the ship\'s computers.

Well, part of the problem with your assumptions here is that there is
only a few countries on the planet that are actively engaged in such
spending, and the majority of that is in non-commercial stuff. Space is
not a viable commercial venture, other than sattelites right now, so no
one spends the money on it. No one\'s going to spend the money on it
until it DOES become economically viable, which means, despite the rosy
predictions of all the free-enterprise types out there, it just won\'t
happen unless it\'s done as public expenditures.

A better (IMHO) idea of what could be built is to look at more
established modes of transport and how much is built there. When you
look at prices, starships, such as free traders, are pretty much along
the lines of Boeing 767\'s DC-10\'s, or smallish freighers...how many of
_those_ are built every year? when space is a commercially viable
venture, I could easily see getting ramped up to the kinds of starship
production you mention.

Titan games can still sell the stuff becaus they probably already
_bought_ it from their wholesale sources, it\'s just inventory to them.
If they\'re selling it on commision for him, that\'s another matter
entirely, but I\'d really doubt it.

Also Walt _can_ sell it, it\'s just that the IRS will want all the money
from the sale to cover whatever tax lien they have on. The IRS, to my
knowledge, will _never_ tell someone they can\'t sell stuff, as the IRS
will _never_ pass up a chance to get money from people.

The distinction is between the store selling already purchased materials
and the subject (presumably) of a lien selling the materials...

Because Quincy over at Titan Games generally sells used, discontinued, or

I don\'t remember the original reference, but if it does say that it\'s an 
error. The objects are about 1/3 the temperature of the sun - mass would be 
between 1/20 and 1/10 or so that of the sun (and currently very uncertain
because neither the age nor even the distance to most of these objects is
known.)

One way to think about it is that the real world is building dozens or nearly
a hundred spacecraft per year - and then completely throwing away every 
one of them after a single use, because they\'re almost all expendable 
rockets. In addition, since production rates are low these expendables are
quite expensive - and of course since we don\'t have CG, fusion, or HEPlaR,
their payload fractions are tiny. 

NASA spends perhaps 10 billion per year on spaceflight-related activities.
Commerical spaceflight is probably of the same order of magnitude, as is
military, plus variopus other countries, for a total of 20-50 billion dollars
per year. 

By Milleu E21 (late TL9) this gets much better, as almost all spacecraft
become reusable with a variety of technologies (I\'ve posted a couple of TL9
shuttle and lifter designs.) Still, getting CG from the Second Imperium is a 
enormous step forward - and in any traveller universe, importing CG or thruster
powered shuttles is almost always cost-effective for any TL7-8 world.

I can accept that.  It\'s probably highly likely, too.  However, that would 
just mean that their medical knowledge would crank into high gear to deal with

Only for the first encounter.  Then they learn to deal with nasty critters.

Why would a navigator not jump for the intercept point?  I\'m reasonably
certain that the nav program has the orbital data for all jumps within its
range updated as soon as it lands.  It could also reasonably calculate from
previously KNOWN data where it needed to exit if you weren\'t able to get a
fresh update.

 I believe that the low end of the 168 hours would be at the near edge of
the hex and the high end would be at the far edge.  Thinking along these
lines one can assume if your jump goes according to computations you will
exit jump + or -  a few minutes of what was predicted by the computer and
you will be within the 100 D specs.  This allows for all planetary movement
so that you won\'t be on an intercept course with other gravity wells in that
system.

That to me is why the jump calculations take so long in the first place.
There will be the occasional anomaly that causes some minor (hopefully)
"deflection" that could throw you off.  I personally think this will be as
rare as misjumps if you have proper software, trained operators and good
maintenance.

Yes - this occurs in a number of sources (such as The Traveller Adventure), 
which suggest it is safe enough for regular use.

Because the variability is + or - 24 hours, which if you match velocity with
the star would put you at +- 11 light-seconds for a planet comparable to earth
(with an orbital velocity of c. 40 km/second).  Even if you do match velocity
simple acceleration by the planet can shift your exit point by over ten
thousand kilometers (if you intersect earlier or later in its orbital path),
though this is probably safely ignorable under normal circumstances.

Why wouldn\'t they be able to. Is there a restraining order in place? Was all
JG product confiscated by the IRS? 

mind you, there is almost no market for JG stuff anywhere -- Crazy Egor used
to give it away at conventions if people bought any other Traveller product he
had.

You aim for where the planet will be in 7 days 12 hours.  That takes care of 
your bracket.  It\'s canonical that an incoming jump will drop you right at 100 
diameters, no closer.

You seem to have ignored the other two paragraphs that went with this
post.....

Once you exit J space you fall back under Newtonian laws. The plus or minus
24 hours could (and I believe does) exist to reflect the distance from one
side of a hex to the other.  The navigator WOULD calculate the location of
your destination down to the second and bring you out of jump at the point
where it would be on an intercept course moving at the exact speed it had
attained when it entered jump.  Whether it takes 144 hours or 182  or more
probably somewhere in between depends on where the jump exit point is
calculated to be.  The program would run the orbits of all gravity wells in
the new system  looking for the optimum exit point based on your present
heading and speed.  I believe that once committed it would give a short
countdown (5-10 secs) to allow for it to include its exact present location
so that it WILL know to the second when it will need to exit jump space.

This to me is the only way it makes any sense to have the 48 hour deviation
in jump and it still be considered SAFE travel.  It is also the best reason
to have TRAINED operators flying the craft and making minor adjustments.
For example, gross weight is adjusted as the ship burns off hydrogen, your
spare ship isn\'t in its hooks this jump,  you only have to compensate one
turret instead of your normal two, damage in the jump screen and ????  There
are numerous other reasons to have highly trained navigators on ships with
big computers and good engineering monitoring systems plus the best software
you can lay your hands on.

It has been mentioned in several places that quick jump calculations get you
into trouble and in the recent Traveller novel a poorly arranged departure
kept them in system an extra 24 hours while they were maneuvering away from
all the gravity wells.  Low level computers,  poorly trained navigators, bad
LH, and ill maintained drives all lead to long in system hauls because you
aren\'t coming out where the computer calculated you would.

I do want to emphasize the concept of proper planning and good calculations
should lead to you being where you\'re supposed to be at the exact time
you\'re supposed to be there and it DON\'T matter if it took 144 or 182
hours.  The time equates to which side of the hex or where in the hex you
exit.

THIS IS MY OPINION!

On top of that it isn\'t JG that\'s selling the stuff.  This stuff was
previously sold by JG and has been picked up thru (I\'m sure) legitimate
means by Titan Games.  Quincey Koziol (sp?) buys bulk items that he then
resells.  He apparently buys these from other dealers and some times
individual pieces from a gamer/collector/angry mom which he then resells for
profit.  JG isn\'t selling anything anymore.  It\'s the same as going in and
buying  a GDW or Digest Group product that is no longer in print.  NO ONE
said he got the stuff from JG, just that it was originally produced by JG.

As an aside on genetic variability - I was chatting to a veterinarian
friend a few months back, who mentioned that at some stage in the past
cheetahs were almost entirely wiped out, and they are all very closely
related as a result. In fact apparently you can transplant organ from one
cheetah to another without bothering to check for compatibility.

Since it was my work that prompted the revival of this, I guess I should 
comment.

Why are the Vilani so vulnerable to Terran diseases during the RoM?

1. Weakened immune response system. The Vilani have spent 300,000 years 
in what is basically a sterile environment. During all that time there was nothing 
on Vland likely to kick their immune response into action. The upshot of this is 
that random genetic mutation will slowly weaken their immune response 
system.

2. No exposure to viruses. Given our knowledge to date, it is rather beyond 
belief that any alien ecosystem will throw up a virus which can infect a human 
(or any other terrestrial life for that matter). Therefore it is almost certain that 
the Vilani do not know of viruses (or if they have encountered them in veterinary 
science they believe that they can\'t infect humans) and almost certainly have 
not developed vaccinations or anything like antiviral drugs (aside- as at 1998 we 
here on Earth have no drug which can be classed as an antiviral agent either).

3. General poor quality of biomedical tech. It is established canon that the 
Vilani were very very weak in this area (even if it were not, everything else 
points at this). The Terrans have developed their advanced biomed technology 
because it was a day to day matter of life and death for them (eg if they didn\'t 
they died very quickly). Every day of a Terran\'s life he or she is assualted by 
disease organisms; no matter how many hostile microbes the Vilani have 
encountered since leaving Vland it won\'t even amount to 1/10,000th of the 
threat the Terrans have faced. It is not beyond belief that the Vilani response to 
disease has not progressed beyond quarantine, if they have any understanding 
of disease it will be very basic. Any alien species is unlikely to yeild much 
knowledge due to incompatable biochemistry and the human minor races have 
the same problems as the Vilani (though to a lesser degree) and anyway none 
of these races had achieved better than TL 8 (probably much less).

4. Lack of medical resources. The Vilani will have medical specialists, probably 
good ones. But they will be in areas such as trauma care, midwifery, oncology, 
radiation medicine, dietary care etc. not the treatment of disease. Thus when 
the PoD arrives, the Vilani medical staff are floundering, within days the 
hosptials are bulging at the seams and social cohesion is breaking down.

5. Social habits. The Vilani live in communially in close contact with large 
numbers of their peers. These make the spread of disease much easier and 
effective quarantine much harder.

Remeber its taken us several thousands of years to learn to deal with these lil\' 
critters, there is no reason to suspect the Vilani would do so very much faster.

I\'m probably going to get killed for this but,

In a book I read a while back, Dangerous Visions I think it was, there was a
story about a planet where incest was the norm. They mentioned something
about breeding cattle and that you don\'t get genetic mutations from breeding
related cattle, in fact if there\'s a preferred trait then you breed them
together to get the desired trait in the offspring.
Any Ranchers out there who can set me right?

The Canonical CT 400dtn Corsair is not what someone (say, a PC) 
would design as a frontier pirate/commerce raider/Armed Merchant.
I don\'t even think it was purpose built, as such, for anything...it\'s
an accumulation of rebuilds and refits over a long and varied
service life.

Reasons:

1) Unstreamlined. Patrol Cruisers, SDB\'s, Sub Merchants, so many
ships in this size class are streamlined. Not even a ship\'s boat to
get dirtside with. Why, especially in a frontier area?

2) 3 Turrets. Why not four? You\'re a combat vessel, why not get
that 33% boost in firepower? Or at least a hardpoint for it?

3) Low berths. Twice as many as you have crew staterooms.
What is this, an interstellar slumber party?

Then it came to me, especially from reason #2...the Corsair we
know and love didn\'t start out life as a Corsair, or even as a
400dtn vessel. At the beginning of it\'s operational life, lost at
the front of the "lineage and paperwork" of "uncertain origin",
lies a streamlined, 3-turret, medium performance 300dtn
patrol/scout vessel.

Probably built in the shipyards of a TL12ish Spinward Marches planet
before the Imperial annexation, this class of vessel may have served
patrol and exploration duty for an independent planet or small
interstellar state. They were eventually declared obsolete in this role,
and other uses were found for them. Some were eventually converted
to a cargo-carrying role by the simple expedient of welding a 100-ton
cargo bay onto the hull - wrecking it\'s streamlining, and explaining why
the ship only has 3 turrets - it\'s really a 300dtn hull with a permanent
cargo pod on it. The external capture bay seems limited to 100dtns, 
so this seems to work a few ways. The low berths are enough to
hold an entire crew, even if the staterooms were double-occupied - 
insurance against a misjump, perhaps, and useful if this patrol/scout
vessel were pressed into a medical role. I estimated the fuel for
our hypothetical 300dtn ship as about enough for a jump-3, or
(if local TL didn\'t support Jump-3 tech) a Jump-2 and Jump-1\'s worth
of misjump insurance.

The ships wore out in lots of ways, and were sold off to other interests - 
a popular class of ship in it\'s day, they hit the used ship market in
a varied state of wear and random levels of demilitarization.

It\'s been a long time since the Corsair was a sleek, nimble, streamlined
patrol ship. Her military drives have long since worn out without 
military parts and maintenance, they\'ve been replaced with salvaged
or used civilian drives - they fit poorly in her engineering spaces,
some assemblies perhaps even protruding from the hull. Her bow 
to her ventral edge is a malformed, snaggletoothed mess, the bulge 
of a clamshell-doored cargo bay ruining her lines but giving her a
rough, barbaric look. She\'s old and grey, but a series of owners - 
everything from scouts to traders to starmercs - have done their best
to keep her running, even keep parts of her current. Right now she\'s
a Pirate...and she may soon meet her end as such.

Just a play on the idea that a superdense/Crystaliron hull is expensive,
and probably very durable. I can\'t see why you wouldn\'t have ships
refitted and remodelled from bygone days still in service, though they
make your 40-year old rustbucket free trader look like new by
comparison. There\'s no good reason, in a mature and cosmopolitan
interstellar state, for every trade ship to be a standard Free, Far,
or Fat Trader, even if that\'s been 90% of the new merchant builds
for the past half-century or more. 

"Wow, you just paid off your Free Trader? Cool, let me buy you a
drink. My bank payment? Oh, Great-Great-Grandma paid that off
long before I was born...I am working on that loan I took out for a
replacement jump drive, though..."

  This is a good point, and also addresses the threat of PC\'s skipping
with their ships - which can really screw the GM\'s plans to run a game
in a certain area of space. 

  A simple way to handle this is to assume that Imperial law specifies
that ownership of a stolen ship reverts to the last legal owner of
record. This ensures that most potential purchasers will be very careful
in buying, and that they (or the bank holding the mortgage with the ship
as collateral) will do everything possible to ensure same, not the least
of which being waiting long enough for confirmation of the ships status
to arrive.

  The last depends on the size and communications of a region, but a ship
will likely only have travelled a modest distance from its\' owner or an
empowered agent of same, and communications need not be to such, but only
to a point within the commo radius from a possible ship theft.

  Does that include my theoretical case of the one-off "opportunist"
committing an act of piracy? The issue arises because that model
disavows piracy as a long term course for the actor in question.

  In any case, I\'ll try to get around to refurbishing my old idea of
the in-system traffic predator.

    'body' => 'Anson Betts was asking about Amber Zones:

An Amber Zone is a travel classification by the Travellers\' Aid Society,
intended to warn their members to use added caution when venturing
to that system. Some common reasons:

1) Xenophobia: The natives tend to react in a hostile fashion to those
from other planets or cultures. You may be a target for assault, robbery,
or murder, so you may want to stay in the extra-territorial starport
area, or only venture forth in large groups.

2) War scare: This planet might be a balkanized one on the brink of
a massive world war. Or it might be the planet "everyone knows"
will be the first one the evil Sword Worlders invade when they stop
saber-rattling and mobilize - next week for sure, if not soon after, that\'s
what I heard, yup...
An Amber Zone, IIRC, was posted for much of the Spinward
Marches in the immediate aftermath of the Fifth Frontier War
as things settled down again - this was temporary.

3) Civil Disorder: Perhaps a corrupt or tyrannical regime is being
nice to tourists, but oppressing the masses. The masses might
respond with terrorist attacks on tourists, frequent riots that
Travellers might get caught up in, that kind of thing. If the regime
cracks down harder, this can lead to another kind of Amber Zone:

4) Dangerous Government: Perhaps the Grand Leader is a loon.
Or his customs inspectors have a reputation for ripping every ship
down to the hull plates during "routine" inspections, and sending
you to the salt mines for a suspicious looking breath mint.
You can\'t leave the starport without a police escort to "guard"
(i.e, keep an eye on) you. Byzantine laws make it a serious threat
to your freedom to take a walk down a street, if the group of
jackbooted police thugs you run into are in the mood.
At least one Spinward Marches non-Imperial world (Ruie, Regina 0209)
is Amber Zoned simply because it\'s not Imperial - perhaps neither
the government nor the people like Imperials much.

5) Crime: Go to this planet, and organleggers will sneak into your
hotel room and steal your high-grade offworld kidneys. Organized
crime will steal your ship blind the minute you hit downport. Every
other person you meet tries to steal your wallet. Trust no one here.

6) Environment: The natives know how to stay alive here, you don\'t.
The weather, the wildlife, something here is unusually dangerous.

btw - for more fun, use several of the above at once...jackbooted
police thugs rule the day, criminal gangs run the night, and another
country is massing troops at the border...

Amber Zone warnings tell you that it is dangerous to go to this world,
so you should take precautions. Knowing what the danger is should
be half the battle. Travellers will go to Amber Zones, as the danger can
drastically increase the profits...how much will passengers pay
our Free Trader captain to get off a world that\'s about to go to war?

Red Zones are an advisory not to travel to the area at all. I believe
the Zhodani consulate is red-zoned to Imperial citizens, and most
of the Spinward Marches were red-zoned (IIRC) during the
Fifth Frontier War. A Red Zone classification will be applied to
a world under interdiction, a world it is illegal to go to - the Travellers\'
Aid Society strongly recommends you not go there, as an Imperial
patrol ship will board you and put you in jail. Most long-term Red Zones
will be for interdicted planets, so it might seem to the average
citizen that a Red Zone is a government classification, and they might
use the word as a synonym for "Interdicted" - though it is inaccurate.

Anything that translates into a significantly greater danger to travellers than 
is the norm.

War/insurrection (it need not be global to rate an Amber Zone).
Repressive governments and/or very high law levels.
Lawlessness (not necessarily the same as Law-0)
Less virulent diseases (such as STDs - diseases that require a certain behavior 
   to catch, rather than simple contact).
A xenophobic population.

Personally, I\'d place designate 20th-century Terra an Amber Zone.  We have our 
quota of all of the above.  An Amber zone lets the traveller know he should 
find out why the Amebr zone, before he passes out through the starport gates.

Subject: 	Amber Zones

I was just reading in the MT Ref\'s manual about amber zones, what are the
criteria for making a world an amber zone?

War? I don\'t think so, unless it\'s global or nuclear (in which case it\'ll 
be
over in a couple of hours). Look at earth today, we have numerous wars 
going
on but it\'s still safe to visit most countries.

Disease? Remember Ebola? It didn\'t make the whole planet un-safe, just a
portion of it dangerous. I wonder if AIDS could be considered lethal enough
to stop visitors, it\'s certainly lethal and communicable...

Famine? Hell this would make the planet ripe for trade, just bring em food
and they\'ll love you.

Pestilence? Anything pestile enough to make an amber zone would have chewed
the colonists long ago.

Anyone else got any ideas?

 Anson

One only, imho.  You are assuming that we have the same perceived sense of
the value of space vessels as a world in the Traveller universe.

Earth, right now, gets very little benefit from space vessels.  You can bet
dollars to donuts that if there was a clear strategic advantage to earth
armed forces having asteroid bases, or clear monetary benefits to Microsoft
Space Station, we would have them.  Right now, our pittance of probes and
sattelites come from the most technically advanced nations on earth, and
are so far in advance of what the other nations produce that there is not a
lot of pressure to produce more.

In the TU, it is very clear what the benefits are, and every world has a
history of why the days of star travel were the good old days, and how the
worlds with space vessels are making cash hand over fist.  Further, in the
TU, a TL 8.7 world like us is clearly behind, not the leader, and so feels
a lot of pressure.

Just a quick note, this is completely legal in the US.
Best to ask, am I under arrest?  If yes, say nothing.  Ask for lawyer.
If no, walk, but do not run, away.

Brown Dwarfs Get Some Respect 

S A N   D I E G O,   June 9 - The most
common stars may be the ones that
failed. 
     Today at a meeting of the American
Astronomical Society, astronomers
announced they have uncovered 20 dim,
cool dwarf stars in a small slice of our
galactic backyard, within 100 light-years of
Earth. 
     Extrapolating the findings over the whole
galaxy shows "they are the most populous

I don\'t believe the ships would be readily saleable.  Perhaps to another

without a great discount.  

I think your assumption is that he\'s only in it for the money, and that 
if he could sell his ship for a good profit, then he could enjoy life.  
IMO, his drive is more than money.  Greed, a sense of machismo, the 
thrill of the chase, the hunt, the kill, the beating of the system.  
These all enter into the equation.  A pirate would be bored, bored, 
bored if he just sold his ship and lived on the proceeds.  I think he 
would turn pirate again after a while, maybe hijacking a ship and 
starting again....

He built it because someone ordered it.  When you go to purchase a new 
ship, you give the downpayment, and then pick your ship up in months. I 
don\'t think just go to your local starship dealer and get a ship...

Here I disagree with the OTU (I think).  These ships are "standard" 
ships per LBB2.  I think they can be built with standard components, but 
would be by no means standard for a shipyard to build.  In fact, I would 
think that the shipyard that built these would be one of the friendly 
havens for pirates (double sets of books, bribery, forgery, all the 
standard things) and probably a place where the annual maintenance could 
be done without too many questions :-)

Granted.  But I\'m meaning that you wouldn\'t pay life support if you are 
living on a planet and only go catch a ship/cargo when you get bored or 
when you need some cash or cash equivalents...

A merchant is always using his ship, needs to to keep making his 
payments.  He\'s making jumps at the rate of 2 per month or so...  A 
pirate living on a planet, OTOH, and only making sorties when he needs 
to would have periods of less usage, then periods of intense usage... So 
I would think that his costs would vary.  During forays of piracy, he 
would use merchant costs, higher if he were running and needed 
"specialty work without questions asked".

Life support and living expenses are different.  A PC could avoid all 
"life support" costs just by not having a ship to live on.  I\'m meaning 
what is his standard of living?  Gold drinking mugs?  Lots of retainers 
demanding pay?  Servants?  High tech habits that cost lots of credits?  
Or simple life that isn\'t very expensive.  I would think the 
"Bluebeards" of the Spinward Main would live high on the hog and 
therefore have higher expenses than your standard PC.  Someone being 
very austere might not have so high a standard of living...  BTW, what 
does it run the average "citizen" to live?  Hans, I know you\'ve done 
those figures before, and you\'ve sent them to me, but I can\'t remember 
where I put them right now.

These were just suggestions.  You may have a mole in the piracy 
suppression force of a system...  That would be expensive, but may prove 
profitable if you know when and where the forces are.  Much like the 
drug runners coming into the southern parts of the US.  They love 
knowing where the Coast Guard is and where the radars are set...  Then 
they go elsewhere...

I don\'t know if there is a really good scheme, but I\'ll think about it.  
If your pirate is just a "pirate of opportunity", then there won\'t be an 
intelligence network.  If your pirate has done this for a while, and he 
is the exception to the rule (you know, the successful pirate that is 
required to make this discussion relevent) then he might have one...

Well, some of my assumptions interwoven in the above.  Planet based, for 
sure.  Secure, mostly.  No mortgage on the ship.

Actually, with cattle lines you still avoid direct mother/son father/daughter
xbreeds, mostly because you\'re trying to select for specific traits, and often
those traits are present in different individuals.

Humans have outbred so long, in so many diverse poulations, that we have
_lots_ of recessives, that frequency is markedly lower in most domesticated
animals because we have culled the population over the millenia.

Still you see the problems all the time. Hip displasia in dogs is a
genetically linked trait in most breeds, and should be relatively easy to get
rid of. In some breeds and breeding lines they have. It persists in the
general population, though because of breeders who don\'t bother, because they
can make money at it. After all a \'papered\' GSD or Rottweiler can sell for big
bucks...why should the breeder care that the dog will have to be put down in
six years because it can\'t walk anymore and is in constant pain...grrrrrrrr...
(down, bruce...down!)

So for a markedly inbred population to exist you have to pretty ruthlessly
cull, and then, it\'s still only by chance that you would get a stable line.
remember for every inbred strain of animal we have today there are probably
thousands more that didn\'t make it.

The _official_ errata used to be on the University of Western Ontario
site, but the site didn\'t let me in the day before yesterday when I went
to look to see if it was still there (after reading a discussion here.)

However, at least in the vehicle design sections, that wasn\'t all there
was, since some of the errata didn\'t help, and some things were still
clearly wrong by comparison with Striker (version 1). There was also
a discussion of the design sequences in Traveller\'s Digest #14, which
had more errata.

Rob\'s Rule of thumb--check Striker and Book 6 Scouts, and if that doesn\'t
help, make it up...

Basically, any condition that makes the world unsafe for any visitor.  It
could be an environmental problem, social unrest, our even a religious cult
that believes off-worlders are holy and must be kidnapped and worshiped.

The criteria is that the threat is on-going and widespread.  AIDS wouldn\'t
qualify, since you have to work to get it.  Am Ebola varient that was a bit
hardier and spread by aresol would probably qualify.

The only thing I would disagree with him about is #5 - While the Vilani
are perhaps more gregarious than Terrans, I doubt that any one human
population is any harder to quarantine than any other population of a
similar size. It\'s not like every Terran is living is his or her own
shack in the woods.

Brian Mays wrote:

Well... Andrew already addressed this point somewhat, but let\'s look at
how infectious diseases break down. As a warning, I\'m a computer
engineer and marketing person - I didn\'t even take Grade 13 biology, so
this is a pretty "lay" breakdown.

1. infectious "things"
  Things that normally don\'t bother most people, but due to weird immune
systems, happen occasionally, like fungal infections. Most fungal
infections are restricted to the skin, but I believe that really rarely
they can do things like take up residence in the spine or other odd
places and cause problems. It is conceivable that a fungus compatible
with the Vilani could exist away from Earth.

2. bacterial infections
 Some microbacterial organism takes up residence in you. Treatment is
fairly straightforward, via antibiotics. The Vilani might be more prone
to these than Terrans due to having generally weaker immune systems, but
it\'s not like the Terran immune system is so great at dealing with these
either (Gardia - sp? - whacks more than a few campers each year).

3. viral infections
 It\'s difficult to imagine human-compatible viruses arising outside of
an environment like Terra, where there are lots of potential, mostly
genetically similar/compatible hosts. Chances are the Vilani have never
encountered a serious virus and if they had, chances are they just nuked
the planet into one big cue ball. They may have encountered viruses on
minor human homeworlds, but the locals probably also had a cure or
treatment of some sort. This category includes things like (and please,
correct me if I\'m wrong) plagues, influenza, AIDS/HIV and various poxes.
Immunity or susceptibility to these diseases is sometimes genetic
(referring to recent discoveries finding that some people are
genetically immune to HIV)

4. other infections things
 Like mad cow disease, which is, as I understand it, not even up at the
virus level, but more like a really nasty protein or somesuch. These are
usually difficult to transmit and are the best cure is to avoid getting
into the transmission path of the disease.

So, numbers 1 & 4 could probably happen to anyone, anywhere, but aren\'t
that difficult to avoid and don\'t kill huge numbers of people, so they
can be pretty much ignored. Number 2, bacterial infections, are
reasonably preventable with adequate hygiene and are treatable with
antibiotics, which the Vilani could probably discover.

So, that leaves us with number 3.

Treating viral infections has been quite a challenge for us here on
Earth and although we think we\'re pretty good at it, we\'ve only been at
it for about 100 years or so. We\'re just now seeing the results of our
typical methods of treatment - the resurgence of resistant forms of the
disease. Terran methods for dealing with viral infections basically rely
on stimulating our already overworked immune systems into producing more
antibodies, which may or may not work for the Vilani. All things
considered, the majority of our techniques for dealing with diseases
like the poxes and the flu are fairly low-tech - infect everyone with a
really small amount of the disease and they won\'t get it again.

Also, when you look at Vilani psychology and behavior patterns, what
are their likely reactions to encounters with this kind of disease? (I
wish I could quote from V&V here, but my copy is at home) We know that
they don\'t take prisoners of war. We know that they value group benefit
over individual benefit. We know they dislike having to discover new
ways of dealing with things - they would rather do by rote than do by
understanding. We know that most of their medical knowledge is tied up
with the shugilli (sp?) who probably know how to deal with disease
categories 1 & 2 and administer what we\'d consider "homeopathic"
medicines. We know that the Vilani consider themselves superior to other
minor human races and would probably resist adopting anything from such
"inferior" societies.

Also, I\'ve been dying to post this for a while - I heard it in a speech
that was rebroadcast on CBC quite a while ago. Look at the modern method
of treating disease, infection or even things like crop pests.
Essentially you find some "thing" (e.g. some drug or pesticide) that
will affect the disease in question. Let\'s take the example of using a
drug to treat a disease. Because the drug may have side-effects in the
patient, you use as little of the drug as possible to get rid of the
problem. If the problem re-appears, you up the dosage, again, as little
as possible, and re-apply. Eventually you have one of two outcomes: you
have destroyed the disease or you have bred a new version of the same
disease that\'s totally resistant to that particular drug because this
process is, in essence, the same as selecting breeding (in this case,
breeding a new disease strain that\'s drug-resistant).

Maybe the Vilani, for whatever reason, don\'t use this technique. Maybe
they use maximum dosage of any drug right off the bat, regardless of the
side effects. Or maybe they just don\'t bother trying to cure sick people
and just "sterilize" them ASAP.

So, imagine if you will... a group of Vilani land on Planet X and come
back infected. What will the rest of the ship do on discovering this?
Probably space everyone who\'s infected. Problem solved. I\'m sure they\'d
be able to detect who is and isn\'t infected, but curing the infection -
Why bother? The average Vilani doesn\'t like to try to learn new things,
the shugili (sp?) can\'t deal with it, it\'s dangerous to the group...
spacew \'em.

So, everything was probably well and good until those pesky Terrans came
along. While Terran-Vilani interbreeding and Terran disease treatments
probably brought the Vilani disease resistance a long way in a short
time, those first, early days of contact were probably, well... *cough*
*hack* less than pleasant for the Vilani.

if I\'ve gotten something terribly wrong, please, do correct me.

> 1. infectious "things"

Fungi that infect humans tend to infect exterior surfaces, as most of
them are aerobic, requiring oxygen to live; this however, includes
things that _most_ people don\'t consider exterior, things like lungs,
the digestive tract, and some parts of the genito-urinary tract.
infection happens under two major conditions, (with some exceptions) the
fungi colonizes a part of the body hard for immune cells to reach (dead
layers of epidermis, mucus membranes) athlete\'s foot and yeast
infections in women fall into these categories. All that is required for
this is that the organism physically be able to live on the host
(temperature, atmosphere , stc) and be able to metabolize something on
the host (otherwise the stuff doesn\'t grow). These cause prblems in
humans when the conditions, normally unfavorable to growth (things like
skin pH, availability of micronutrients, exposure to the organism, etc,
change, and cause a \'bloom\', a population surge that overwhelms the
hosts ability to fight it off. The itching typical of such infections,
in fact, is due to the immune response.

In immuno-compromised hosts, the fungi can invade many more places on
the host.

> 2. bacterial infections

Bacteria work in much the same fashion as fungi, they live on the host,
using it as a source of food; any damage done to the host is due to
either overwhelming growth of the bacteria, toxins excreted by the
bacteria, or side-effects of the host\'s immune response. Bacteria can
also be abnaerobic or facultative anaerobes, meaning they don\'t need
oxygen to survive. Anaerobes are often poisoned by oxygen, in fact,
which is why there are only a few strict anaerobes that cause problems
in humans. Bacteria that normally colonize humans have developed
defenses against the immune system, such as slime coats that preven
attachments of immune molecular markers and suchlike.

Ok, Giardia is something else entirely, they are protozoal parasites.
They colonize the gut, but in action they\'re more akin to fleas than
anything else. Again, there are a large number of parasites that have
evolved to attack humans, most of them have also evolved fairly
sophisticated defenses against the human immune system. 

 
> 3. viral infections

Viruses are the most exquisitely obligate parasites in existence. The
vast majority affect only a single species. Others live benignly in some
hosts, and are ragingly infections in others. One theory going around is
that many of these viruses are in fact, not parasites, but symbiotes.
They live in their own host without effect, but infect and kill
\'competitors\' of the host. This is one theory for the rising incidence
of nasties like Ebola...humans are invading the rainforests, disturbing
the hosts, causing them to start shedding virus, causing the infections,
removing the disturbing elements. This would be a clear evolutionary
advantage.

This is also extraordinarily unlikely to occur anywhere but on Terra. 

This theory is explained in better detail in the last chapters of:

    'body' => 'I always love discussions on Jump Theory.  They get so involved, so
technical with proponents pounding in on every possible angle.

And it\'s all made up!  :)

Anyway, here\'s my .02 cr worth.

You made it.  The pilot was barely sober enough to get his Imperial ID (with
his Pilot\'s ticket) plugged into the NavComp after a week of downport
liberty, and he totally forgot to take into account the change in mass for
the new cargo for the dustoff from that miserable, Class E excuse of a
starport.  If he hadn\'t been trying to show off and perform the launch by
the \'seat of his pants, he wouldn\'t have dragged the port landing skid
through the berm surrounding the berth.  (At least it was only compacted
earth, rather than the duro-concrete that would have been used at a more
advanced facility) The fact that the landing skids were only retracted once
he punched up the standard orbit profile and engaged the autopilot only
makes you regret the credits you saved by hiring this Pilot-1 instead of the
Pilot-4 who also answered your ad a bit more.

Still, the computer has you in a standard orbit.  The Pilot is passed out in
his seat - his cert still active in the computer.  What now?

Automation is a wonderful thing.  Starships have the capacity to virtually
fly themselves, but a Pilot is required by Imperial law.  Fire up the
\'Manuever\' program, plug the certification (coded into a Imperial ID card)
into the Pilot\'s workstation and the ship is ready to fly.  The software
that he and the astrogator use has certain functions built in that allow for
extreme ease of use.

\'Maneuver\' functions:
\'Establish Orbit\' - moves you from a point in space to a designated planet
and establishes a Imperial Standard orbit.  Also used to return to a
Standard Imperial orbit from either a downport or highport.

\'Land\' - takes you from an Imperial Standard orbit to land at the designated
spaceport (requires either active sensors or a direct communications link
with an ATC computer.)  Note - local gravity must be less than the rated
output of your M-Drive (the software does not allow for overdriving the
M-drive.)  This function is not designed for \'Wild\' (non-spaceport)
landings, although it will take a ship down to a \'soft\' (i.e. water) landing
quite well.

\'Dock\' - computes and executes the manuevers necessary to dock with a
designated space platform or craft (requires either active sensors or a
direct communications link with an ATC computer.)

\'Go There\'  - the pilot picks a point or planet from the system display, and
the software computes and executes the necessary manuevers to reach those
coordinates.  When the \'Generate\' package is running, the Maneuver series
integrates the resulting calculation into the \'Go There\' function and
executes it.

\'Evade\' - Specific upgrades to the software package, it permits the pilot to
override specific safety functions in the \'Manuever\' software (such as
closest permissable approach, drive ratings, max atmospheric speed, hull
stress warnings, etc...)

\'Generate\' allows the astrogator to set up and execute Hyperspacial
Transitions (Jumps).  Stellar and planetary data is culled from the Library
Data package and used for the calculations.  Making a Jump in any but the
most controlled conditions is considered very hazardous, and to this end
most astrogators prefer to reduce as many additional variables as possible.
The most basic function of the software establish a Jump calculating a
direct course from point A to point B.  Increased capabilities in the
software allow for:

Running Jump - jump to hyperspace with a realspace vector.  Normally an
astrogator will plot a jump with a system neutral vector.

Running Exit - emerge from hyperspace with a realspace vector.  Normally an
astrogator will plot a jump to result in a system neutral vector.

Jump offsets - permits the astrogator to plot a realspace course that would
result in a Jump to one point, when in reality the Jumpgrid activates in
such a way as to provide a J-Vector to another point.  (i.e. he left Mos
Eisley on a course for Dantooine, but actually jumps to Yavin.)  If a
scanner is directed at the starship at the time of jump, it is possible to
eventually - it\'s a formidible task for a astrogator even with computer
assistance - be able to determine the course laid in.

Emergence offsets - normally the course of the jump is calculated, if
possible, to cross the path of the destination planet.  This is to allow the
gravity well of the target planet to precipitate the emergence at
approximately the 100 diameter point.  It is possible, however, to program
the jump to emerge at any point the astrogator desires, within the
capability of the J-drive.  This is considered to be a very challenging task
for an astrogator because of variances in the individual ship\'s jump fields,
as well as the minor errors in the library database, as well as any errors
introduced by the astrogator or pilot in the course of plotting and
executing the jump.

Coordinated Jumps - used when more than one ship will be jumping, and it is
desirous for all the ships to appear in a coordinated fashion.  Again,
because of individual variances in the jump fields, detailed information
must be passed between all of the ships in the squadron for the \'Generate\'
programs to produce an effective jump-plan.  This can be a very dangerous
manuever, and is generally only performed by military ships with a
task-optimized \'Generate\' program.

I generally provide \'basic\' packages to the players - if they want access to
more advanced features they need to either \'upgrade\' or write additional
features into their own software.

With the fungal thing, I actually had in mind a case someone told me
about last week... a child was in our local Sick Kid\'s hospital for
quite a while with a variety of symptoms that were untraceable to any
one root cause... until someone discovered that some fungus had taken up
residence in his spinal cord. If that sounds odd, it may well be wrong,
but that\'s how I heard the story (in the context of how great Sick Kid\'s
is in that this kid did eventually get diagnosed and treated). Your
description of fungal infections seems at odds with this, so I\'m not
sure what to think of the story I heard, but I suppose we could use our
imaginations to come up with some sort of anaerobic fungus-like
microorganism that could set up shop in places you don\'t want it to.

> Ok, Giardia is something else entirely, they are protozoal parasites.

Hm, I hadn\'t though about parasites. I suppose it is conceivable that
the Vilani could have run into some sort of parasite that could cause
them problems, but like bacteria, parasites are (mostly) easy to prevent
once you know their "attack vector". There might be a Vilani equivalent
of the deer tick, but it won\'t exactly be destroying millions or
toppling empires.

> Viruses are the most exquisitely obligate parasites in existence. 

Viruses work via the virus hijacking a cell\'s DNA reproduction
mechanism, right? They\'re basically a protein shell with some RNA
inside, right? Or am I hallucinating what little I know about viruses?

Also, on the topic of viruses, there has been some news of late that
some researchers are starting to think that conditions like ulcers and
diabetes (not the late-onset type, I forget which is which) are, in
fact, caused by viruses and not by some failing of the body\'s internal
systems. If a lack of viruses causes a lack of diseases like diabetes,
ulcers and so on, this could explain that darn Vilani long lifespan.

Again, thanks for the clarifications!

personal computers, in Traveller (in an MT setting).

The Traveller rules for computers focus on starship computers,
naturally.  The MT rules seem to have dropped the CT concept that
different computer programs competed for space in the ship\'s computer,
that you could only run so many programs (forex: while the computer was
running the jump calculations, the anit-hijack program had to be
suspended).

These rules are a bit dated, to say the least, as has been discussed
many times before.  (Anyone have better rules?)

What I\'d really like to focus on, though, are rules for handling the
interaction of PCs with personal computers.  IMTU, I envision a wearable
PC, about the size of a deck of cards, with the power of what would
today be a low-end supercomputer.  It is, of course, connected to the
local network (ship-wide or world-wide) via high-speed, wide-bandwidth
wireless connection.  Input/Output for the user is via several means.  A
version of Glenn Grant\'s Smartglasses provides display output (a
complete heads-up holodisplay, with eye and head position tracking), as
well as audio output.  Input is via voice (using the Smartglasses), and
also by means of a bracelet that senses both movement and neuromuscular
activity to allow the user to "point-and-click", to handle "virtual"
objects (but with no tactile feedback), and to "type" or "draw".  For
those requiring tactile feedback, Data Gloves are available.  All of
these peripherals talk to the personal computer wirelessly.

Given all of this, what are some reasonable rules for their use?  What
do I do when the PC inevitably wants to write a new program to hack the
net, or crack some megacorps\' security?  How powerful would a \'smart
agent\' program be in searching the net for data useful to the PCs?

Any thoughts?  :o)

My description was over-simplified. It is certainly possible to get
systemic infections with fungi, though in non immune-compropmised people
they are extremely rare. We are areobic, so it\'s quite possible for
organisms to get O2 from inside of us, but they\'ll be quite slow
growing, particularly in the case of obligate aerobes like fungi.

well, the deer tick itself is relatively harmless...it\'s the bacterium
causing Lyme disease that gives us fits...

Still, it\'s unlikely that true parasites on alien worlds will have much
to do with us...parasites tend to specialize quite a bit on specific
hosts. There are relatively few, such as the deer tick that generalize,
for instance, in warm-blooded mammals.

Well, partly. Those are the RNA viruses, such as AIDS and influenza.
Others are DNA plus protein, but the basic modus operandi is the same,
hijack the cell\'s own machinery to make new viruses.

There\'s a bacterial infection that\'s been conclusively linked to gastric
ulcers, following Koch\'s postulates...an Australian researcher, who did
not have an ulcer, deliberately infected himself with the bacteria and
promptly developed ulcers, and cured himself with antibiotic treatment.
Since then, there has been quite a bit of success treating ulcers with
antibiotics.

As far as diabetes, there are a number of postulated causes, viruses are
a leading candidate in some cases. Diabetes, however is a hard one,
since the juvenile onset form (Type II or II I can never remember which)
is reasonably well recognized as an autoimmune disease. What\'s unclear
is how much of the other clinical symptoms associated with diabetes is
due to the diabetics altered metabolism, the treatments, or further
autoimmune problems.

The real problem is that most referees have a very limited image of what a
successful role playing game is.  This is not necessarily a problem, as
long as the players match that very narrow image, and have a good idea of
the genre.  For example, most of my games devolve into a quasi spy/action
movie plot, in which there is a fair amount of gunfire., a lot of
conspiracies, and a whole legion of Mr Shoes characters talking in circles.
 On the plus side, money is rarely a real problem for this kind of plot, so
I do not usually need to keep them dirt poor.  No amount of money can
really solve their problems, while influence is a very dear coin indeed.

Usually, there is an ancient site crawl in there somewhere, and often at
least one, but rarely more than three, killer ships that everyone in the
party would kill to own.  These are wealth, but off the scale, and players
are not willing to give them up, because they may be the only ways to solve
their adventure.

These are my habits.  If the players are expecting hard boiled thriller, or
mystery, and I do not know it, they will be disappointed.  Given that the
last two were both spy type games, the next one should either be a lost
colony, or a mystery adventure with minimal gunplay.  They should also be
far less political, if I have any say in the matter.

Since I know my own habits, I spend some time thinking up the pulls that
will cause Knights of the Realm to subject themselves to this kind of
threat.  In fact, the players in the current game were told to ask for
anything they needed from their patron.  Since his personal operating
budget for them  was a cool ten million a year, they never fazed him with
any of their rather modest requests.

A previous episode had a group all trying to become rich rich rich, so they
did not care about small amounts of cash.  They were setting up a colony
world.

In other games, cash was a big motivator.  when the players struck it rich,
that games was essentially over with.

So, if you have cash as a primary motivator, it really screws you up if the
players have a lot of it.  If they only have a little, then it can be fun.
Unless the GM is willing to change the structure of the planned game, a
rich player entering a cash poor game is going to be hard to handle.  I
usually change the game in question, rather than blunt the creativity of
the players, but then, I rarely plan out the details of what will happen.

My next game might be based around several TAS members, without a lot of
wealth, but with a lot of wanderlust.  They will go to interesting and
exotic places every few months, and have the intervening time to explore,
get in trouble, and otherwise enjoy themselves, with the end goal being
some grand goal, such as a book on their travels, a complete history of a
minor race, or the real use of an Alien Widget.

Fungal infections can be extremely nasty, and _fast_. Usually people
are immunosupressed that get really nasty ones, but my wife tells me
that people can get a fungal infection and be dead in a matter of

This is reminding me of all these band s that I\'d forgotten about because I
don\'t own any of their music (or have them on records which I can\'t play).

For example I also like:
Led Zeppelin
Roxy Music
The Pretenders
The Moody Blues
Cream
Talking Heads
U2 (their older work, for preference)
Tom Petty

and in my less sane moments:
Madonna
Blondie
Abba

I also 20th century \'classical\' music by Mahler, Vaughn Williams and
Sibelius. I find Mahler wonderfully atmospheric for roleplaying heroic
fantasy.

Couple of quick questions.

Does anyone have a Canon description of what exactly is 
done during "annual maintenance"?

Is it the sort of thing that say a 400t maintenance Ship 
couldn\'t do to a 100t Xboat?  If not why not?

Starports have been bugging me recently as having vague 
descriptions. I\'d like to think that you could build an installation 
that was capable of doing annual maintenance on up to say 400t craft, 
without having all the other things that an A or B class 
starport is supposed to  have. I\'m beginning to think that 
a size indicator for the starport is a good idea. (e.g 
Small Class A, or Large Class B, or Large Shipyard with 
only small docks).

Perhaps a port Profile or description could be
Port - 5000t Orbital DryDock, 10000t Orbital Docking (92 
docking bays), 100000t Ground parking space at 3 sites, 
Refined Fuel, Annual maintenance in orbit up to 1000t. 

Has anyone else put any thought into something like this already?

GM fiat thing, I think. The rules are deliberatly vague to either allow or
disallow it.

Optional fudge number one - ships under 1000 dtons count as \'small craft\'
i.e. can be built at type B and have maintainence done at type C.

>Has anyone else put any thought into something like this already?

My personal method is to class starports as according to the pop code they
are designed to service - a pop 7 world with a type C starport would thus
be a C7 starport. It\'s ruling elite may have a class A port for it\'s own
use, so it would have A4 in the world notes.

Needless to say, a starport designed for a small population costs less.

I don\'t allow this for roleplaying reasons.  Important tasks should
be handled by players, not the automatic systems.  I also don\'t

Pull the engines completely off-line for thorough repairs.

Take down each computer for maintenance.

Drain fuel tanks, clean, and inspect for damage.

Close check of lanthanum grid for integrity.

Re-seal airlocks, test integrity of all air-tight compartments.

Repairs as needed.

Also, the ship\'s transponder log downloaded to Imperial authorities.  As
part of certification process, logs checked for obvious illegal activity
(violations of interdicted space, entry into Zhodani space, etc.)  Any
oddities in the record will need to be documented.

If the system has an asteroid belt, or a planet with a the right sort
of ring system (rocky, not icy) you jump the invasion fleet there. 

The fleet will consist of a bunch of construction ships and ships to
defend them and the work area. 

You build *big* mass drivers, and start throwing rocks at the enemy.
You can easily get multi-ton rocks going 100s or even thousands of
kilometers a second. Any base they hit is toast. And a few properly
placed will make life uncomfortable on the planet (you have to be
careful there, unless you *don\'t* want to occupy the planet after you
beat them).

A 10 ton chunk of nickel-iron is only a bit over a meter across. (one
cubic meter of the stuff weighs about 8 tons). At 1000 km/s it will
release as much energy as a 1 megaton bomb on impact. 

You can get a *lot* of 10 ton chunks out of an asteroid a few km
across. And stealthing them is easy. No drive emissions, no powerplant.

Agreed - these are "shut the ship down completely" tasks.

These however should be ongoing tasks performed by the 
Ships engineer - If you\'re in town for a week, why isn\'t 
the engineer working on something?

This bugs me. I\'m not sure why. Partly I think because I 
don\'t believe there is a electronic log option that is 
foolproof, and partly because I don\'t see why it is any of 
the Imperium\'s business. If I get my maintenance done at an 
Imperial starport, then sure, they\'ll try going through my 
logs, but if it\'s not an imperial port (and I don\'t believe 
all of them are) then they may be out of luck. 

This is without addressing the dataprocessing needs of logging 
every ship in the empire, since I think that if they wanted 
to they could - though I don\'t think it would be foolproof, 
nor completely without false positives.

I also wonder about the over-all law level of the Imperium. 
At what law level does the state get to routinely monitor 
the activities of people unconnected with a criminal 
invesitgation? If Dulinor can make a case that he shouldn\'t 
have his mind read before going near the emperor, then I 
think there is a tradition that big brother has limits to 
it\'s authority to pry.

I also think that having an Imperium with a tradition of 
not over-regulating things has advantages from a 
roleplaying POV. Living in a police-state all the time can 
get a bit depressing.

I tend to agree, though I would say "a starport designed to 
service a small number of ships costs less"

So, just to tie this in to that other interminable 
thread...
What does it cost to build a dock that can build one 
pirate ship at a time? 
What about do annual maintenance on one ship at a time?

Tune & ealign the \'jump point initiator\', whateverthehell that is.  (grin)  
Takes a special test rig, big bucks.

Close check of the zuchai crystals for microflaws.

Check integrity of the fusion reactor\'s containment vessel, looking for stress 
cracks.  Check containment control circuitry & tune/realign as necessary.

> Repairs as needed.

I see the test equipment to be \'kindasorta\' like the diagnostic computers for late model cars.  They cost a bunch to buy, a bit to teach how to hook up and run, and they nail you about 50 bucks for the privilege.  But it beats several hundred hours worth of poking & prodding around inside the drives, especially at union scale.  <grin>

Fun place.  Standard atmosphere, slight \'taint\' (heavy metals all over the place), charismatic dictator/self-perpetuating oligarchy, early stellar culture, and within spitting distance of a couple severely hostile powers.

Well, we all know that there are a lot of kooks out there. Cretainly
enough to provide all the pirates we would ever want. And I guess the
OTU is well equipped with multi-millionaires too. But how many crazy
multi-millionaires are there? The thing is, if piracy is_not_ a money-
making proposition, then you need someone who is not only more or less
crazy (easy enough), but who can also afford to indulge himself. Which
is IMO a whole other proposition. That\'s why I\'m most impressed with
the proposed band of desperate mutineers with the hot starship that
can\'t be sold and can\'t make an honest living. Only, I don\'t think they
would be all that frequent.

Well, just how easy do you think it is to hijack a ship?

But that agument assumes that you can just take out your ship and bag a
brace of merchants whenever you feel like it. It dosen\'t address the
question of how easy it is for a pirate to find suitable prey and how
big his chances of capturing them are. You have to be more specific.
Where does the pirate lair? Where does he go to hunt? How long does he
have to wait before a merchant shows up? What are the chances that the
pirate will be allowed to hang around unmolested while he waits?

At the moment I consider the argument "He just goes out and captures a
ship" as more or less equivalent to "He just sneaks into Fort Knox and
pockets a couple of gold bars". It dosen\'t explain anything, it just
changes the question to "How the hell does he do that?"

IMO it works out at an average of Cr10,000.

I\'m afraid that is too vague for me. Give me a typical example from the
Spinward Marches. What world he is based on, how did he get his ship and
crew, where does he go to find his prey, how does he capture it, and how
does he turn his capture into money?

If they acted like a Langston Field, the energy hitting them is
converted to "heat" stored *in the field*. So once its ben beat on a
while it starts glowing as it tries to radiate the excess energy. The
more energy it has to radiate, the "hotter" the field is. And it takes
a bit of time for the energy to distribute itself thru the volume of
the field, that\'s why a laser hit or a fast missile can cause a *local*
"burn through" and only slag *part* of the ship.

It also means that the enemy has a damn good idea how close your field
is to failing, as it goes from red to orange to yellow to white. At
white you are in *deep* kimchee. :-)

Have you *tried* to plot a "timelike" course using Traveller
technology? I have, and it\'s sufficiently *hard* that we can pretty
much ignore it. You need to be able to hit a fair fraction of c to make
it work. And even with thruster plates that\'s not easy.

Frankly, *this* one isn\'t bad. All you have to do is rule that you have
to feed energy to the CG to go up, and that the energy has to be >= the
change in potential energy. In most cases this is a pretty trivial
amount of energy compared with what a craft is already using.

> Similar problems occur for thruster plates

True. We worked out the equations for thruster plates that *didn\'t*
violate conservation of energy. They\'re interesting, but don\'t resemble
the performance of anything in Traveller *or* in any SF work I\'m
familiar with. :-)

> (nuclear dampers are more complicated).

They only screw up physics if you allow them to be used for some weird
things. For example, if they merely alter the *rate* at which fission
and other weak force and strong force interactions take place, then you
can still supress the detonation of a fission based warhead (lower the
fission rate to something so slow that it can\'t maintain a chain
reaction) and you can also "clean up" fallout and radioactive
contamination (speed up decay until all the stuff has decayed).
Suppressing fusion is harder, but still doable by affecting *rates* of
interaction. 

If you work dampers this way, you eliminate the problems, and only add
a couple of extra limitations (such as a field can\'t both supress
fission *and* supress fusion at the same time). I rather like the extra
dimension that adds to combat. Do you kill their powerplant, or keep
the missile warheads from detonating. Pick *one*. :-)

You also get the ability to more conveniently generate power from *any*
radioactive material by accelerating the decay rate. Whic gives you the
opportunity to have folks grumbling about the idiots in the old days
burying all that *useful* nuclear waste in such hard to get at spots!

How can there be causuality effects from jump drives?  Lightspeed isn\'t being violated, it\'s being sidestepped.

Sounds like my ISP.  <sigh>  They totally khested up the \'move & upgrade\'.  I 
got unsubscribed from my usual half-dozen mailing lists about 4 times since 
Thursday due to bounces while the techies were \'finetuning\' the node.  Course, 
for some bizzareassed reason, they like running a full news feed on their own 
hardware, so the ng\'s were out for a day, too.  <sigh>

The idea is that you render the airlocks useless while you redo each seal.
Also, the engineer will keep on top of major leaks, this is a check for
tiny leaks that might be missed for months.  Also, the repairs are the type
that need heavy cranes and ripping the drives apart.  No Captain wants to
come back with a hot cargo and find his jump drive in 12,743 separate
pieces while the engineer tries to run down that fluctuation.

I see this as a price of doing business in the Imperium.  They want to
track trade patterns, and make sure that smuggling to interdicted worlds is
kept to a minimum.

Let\'s say you had been jumped by pirates and had turned your transponder
off to avoid being a beacon for missiles.  The log would show that; and the
accompanying paperwork would list the circumstances.  The official might
wander by to check on the story, either because he doesn\'t believe it or is
bored and could us a good tale.

Think of it as the Imperial version of truck scales.. a way to make sure
that all these ships are operating safely.

Think of the IRS.  They process hundreds of millions of tax forms every
year.  Some of those set off flags for bad certain reasons, some are
flagged for criminal investigation, and some are chosen at random for
audits.  Most merchants can go an entire career without ever hauling all
their ship records down to the office to justify every jump they\'ve made in
the last year, but a pattern of suspicious activity will get some attention.

Simple, if you don\'t want to file the paperwork, don\'t fly a ship.
Long-haul truckers in the US have to log every hour they are on the road,
and face heavy fines for driving to long.  For 99% of the merchant traffic,
the filing is a formality.  The other 1% usually has a good reason for what
they did.

Not a police state, just making sure that the ships that travel the space
between the worlds are safe and operated by competent staff.

Global war would be a possibility - but how about a long-running

I\'m not a rancher, but ISTR reading about this - yes, it\'s done -
but they also "cull" the herds, destroying any animals showing
undesirable traits, and at the very least taking out of the
breeding pool those animals that _don\'t_ show the desirable
traits.

I think it would take a certain kind of ruthlessness for humans
to do this to humans, and I\'m not sure I\'d want to be part of a
society that had that kind of ruthlessness.  OTOH, our society,
globally, may have become overly sensitized to this because it
has been done in the past, with horrific results.

Easy. If *he* owes the IRS money, that affects things that *he* owns.
But Judges Guild was already paid for the stuff that was sent out to
distributors. And the distributors were paid for the stuff that went
out to stores. And the stores were paid for stuff that was purchased by
gamers. 

So all of those copies are available for sale and the IRS has nothing
to say about it.

BTW, I *seriously* doubt that the IRS has said that he can\'t sell
anything that he\'s got. *I* owe the IRS back taxes. And they would
*love* for me to be able to sell some stuff. I\'d just have to send them
the money (well, most of it). 

So if he\'s not selling, it\'s because he doesn\'t want to give the IRS
all the money. Or, there\'s a slight possibility that the IRS thinks
he\'s trying to sell them too cheaply.

Actually, you have to worry about how much heat the *crew* can stand.
Long before the structure of even the sort of spacecraft *we* build
would be in danger from the heat, the craft would be too hot for the
crew. 

The hull and most of the structure can proably handle 1000 C or more.
Various items inside the ship won\'t do so well. Humans *can* survive
air temperatures of 500 F if they are naked and it\'s the *air* that\'s
that hot (several of the volunteers in the experiment that established
this got burns under sweatbands they were wearing!). But since the
folks on the ship will be wearing clothing *and* in contact with at
least *some* part of the ship, they\'d get contact burns long before
the air got that hot.

So you need to know three things. How fast the ship picks up heat
(joules/sec) and how fast it can *radiate* the heat (also joules/sec).
And how much heat it produces on its own. As soon as heat produced
inside and heat absorbed exceed the amount the ship can radiate, the
ship\'s temp will go up.

And it\'ll keep climbing until the non-radiator sections of the side of
the hull *away* from the star are hot enough to radiate away the
excess energy. 

So you either avoid making close passes around stars or you do it *fast
and spend hours cooling off afterwards.

This sounds like an *excellent* solution to the problem.  Since thrusters
can\'t be used as weapons I\'d say their output is something like neutrinos
or gravitons.  Can anyone check the above math for me and see if this
fueld consumption actually works? 

As for CG, I just assume that CG thrust is directly proportional to the
planets gravity, which explains the 10 diameter limit, at 10 diameters the
thrust is down to 1/400 of the thurst at the surface (ie pretty puny). 
The way I see CG working, it doesn\'t alter the acceleration of gravity,
merely the direction.  An air raft can fall up, down, forward, or any any
other direction desired.

A lot of "ores" are processed "on site" even in primitive areas here on

Regardless of how one feels about the "extraterrestrial origin" theory
for petroleum, carbonaceus chondrites will supply similar long chain
raw materials. So plastics won\'t be *that* rare.

We\'re beginning to learn that clear cutting is *not* the best way to
manage forests. And given things like battle dress, it\'d be quite
possible to build an oversized "Paul Bunyan" suit that\'d let a logger
walk in with minimal disruption, cut down a specific tree and and hook
it to the cable from the air raft. 

That way you get nice trees, all *big* (which mills would prefer to
handle), and on a forest the size of what we used to have in many parts
of the world, you could easily harvest *lots* of trees, and only
harvest the biggest in a given area every 20 or 30 years. But by
selectively harvesting, you\'d be getting trees that were more like 100
years old.

Actually, that\'s a case of byproduct utilization. A *non* farmer would
have to pay for stone that was quarried or otherwise dug up. But in
places like Ireland and New England, there are a lot of rocks mixed in
with the soil. And every winter, frost forces them a bit closer to the
surface. So every year when you plow, you turn up new rocks. So you
take the rocks to the nearest edge of the field and pile them there.
After a few centuries, you have a nice rock wall around the field!

I just had a truly *evil* thought. Let\'s say there\'s some foodstuff or
drink that is only shipped in a limited area (or maybe only produced on
one planet and note exported for some reason). Call it Romulan Ale. Now
picture some patron with more money than sense who wants to serve it at
a *big* party he\'s going to throw next month. So he approaches the
group with an offer. He wants them to go and pick up a load of the
stuff, and get to him in time for the party. And offers a truly huge
bonus if they pull it off. 

Of course, at some point, the local customs folks will get involved,
and the players will be trying to stay (literally!) one jump ahead of them.

This *should* sound familiar. :-) It\'s the plot of "Smokey and the
Bandit" converted to Traveller. But will the players catch on in time? :-)

Sometimes a needed material isn\'t available locally. For example,
bauxite gets shipped instead of aluminum, because it\'s cheaper to pay
ship the (refined!) bauxite to where electricity is cheap than to
produce aluminum on site.

Likewise iron ore gets shipped because you need a lot of coal, and the
two are rarely found together. Traveller will likely get iron from
asteroids and have to use *very* different means of processing it.

But a lot of refining techniques require *enormous* amounts of water.
Of course, it takes lots of water on the planet to produce most types
of ore, too.

Actually, it turns out that *iron* ore depends on life! The magnetite
crystals were produced by bacteria in the days before Earth had an
oxygen atmosphere. They produced energy by reducing the iron from
compounds in solution. Several other metal ores (and some sulfur
deposits!) are also thought to be produced by this sort of thing. So
minable ores may be rarer than we expect.

I think it\'d make more sense to knock 10 years off the age of the ship
for each ship benefit above 5. Thus:

 1: new ship, 40 years of payments
 2: 10 year old ship, 30 years of payments
 3: 20 year old ship, 20 years of payments
 4: 30 year old ship, 10 years of payments
 5: 40 year old ship, no payments
 6: 30 year old ship, no payments
 7: 20 year old ship, no payments
 8: 10 year old ship, no payments
 9: new ship, no payments.

BTW, I don\'t believe that it is *possible* to get 9 rolls of "ship" on
the mustering out tables :-)

I\'m too tired to work out the required formula, but I think the above
table can be extrapolate in such a way as to allow a 1 benefit to get
an *80* year old ship with no payments, and other interesting
possibilities.

One thing that the Vilani *would* be familiar with, but that might
"catch" the Terrans at first is that they could be planets red-zoned
not for diseases, but for lacking important trace elements. 

I just read Niven\'s "Destiny\'s Road" which has a colony that that
barely avoided that fate, I won\'t spoil the plot, but the short version
of the problem is that the planet is old and not very tectonically
active. So there\'s little recycling of elements from the seabottom to
the ecosystem. And the local lifeforms don\'t use potassium, except the
way some earth orgnisms use selenium, as a poison to deter critters
from eating them. One such critter is a type of plankton. So there\'s
almost no potassium in the seawater or on land, because these plankton
have been sequestering it, and then sinking to the bottom of the ocean
when they die. And it\'s a *deep* ocean.

Humans don\'t do well without potassium. And it\'s not a deficiency
disease that were are familiar with on earth. Oops. Whereas the Ziru
Sirka are likely familar with a *lot* of defieciency diseases, as the
nutrients they get are quite different from what we evolved with, and
they will be familiar with ones we aren\'t.

Also, you can have the opposite problem. A planet with lots of some
obscure trace element that has long term toxicity. Asimov did this once
with a planet with high amounts of berylium. Since berylium compounds
are rather nasty, there\'s a major effort to find substitutes for it.
And he just envisioned a time in the future when *why* berylium wasn\'t
used had been forgotten. 

So there are things that we might overlook that the Vilani wouldn\'t.
Alas for the vilani, neither trace element deficiency nor trace element
poisoning are *contagious*.

Actually, even now it\'s advantageous to ship stuff that\'s nowhere
*near* as far along as your "plastic sheets". But in other cases it
won\'t be.

For "ores", things like bauxite are actually already *very* refined. It
takes several steps to get bauxite from the clay the start with. Going
the final step of converting it to aluminum takes *lots* of
electricity, so it\'s worthwhile to ship it to places where electric
power is cheaper. In Traveller, power is *inherently* cheaper. So the
bauxite will be reduced to aluminum at the mine. So you\'ll be shipping
aluminum ingots. 

Given cheap fusion power, I suspect that *most* metal ores will be
reduced to metal before shipping. But since the reduction will be
primarily electrical, the resulting ingots of a few metals will be
*very* different from what we are used to. The primary example would be
iron. The ingots would have essentially *no* carbon content, so they\'d
be a lot different than the sort of iron we are used to. To make steel
they\'d have to *add* carbon. Even more for things like wrought iron and
cast iron. Also, given the easy accessibility of nickel-iron asteroids,
I excpect that iron mining on planets would be limited to low tech
worlds producing for local contstruction.

For stuff like plastics, you either ship the chemicals it\'s made from,
or you ship the "uncured resin". In both casses you\'ll be dealing with
somewhat messy to very nasty liquids (and in a few cases, gases). It\'s
*much* easier to ship a tank of acrylic resin than a bunch of polester
cloth. Ditto for most other plastics. The only time you\'ll be shipping
plastic "stock" is to places that don\'t have to tech level or
industrial base to convert the resins to finished goods.

Coal is definitely a by-product of vegetation. But it\'s still not
certain that the same is true for petroleum. There\'s a minority theory
that still hasn\'t been disproven to the effect that the petroleum
deposits are what\'s left of carbonaceus chondrites and the like and
date back to the *formation* of the planet. 

Even if this theory *is* wrong, chondrites *will* be almost as useful
as petroleum. Especially when you consider that what some wells produce
is essentially asphalt (road tar)! 

And icy bodies from the farther reaches of systems will be processed
not just because the water is useful in space, but because methane and
ammonia are essential starting points for a *lot* of chemical
processes. For example, modern gunpowder starts out as synthetic
ammonia! (plus other stuff). A lot of organic chemistry can use methane
as a starting point.

Some systems may not have enough icy bodies in the outer system to be
worth going after. So methane and ammonia tankers may visit them.

Concrete won\'t. Cement might be, if the planet doesn\'t have the right
sort of atmosphere or hydrosphere. Cement is what you mix with sand,
gravel and water to *make* concrete. You grind several minerals rather
fine and then roast the mixture. One of the critical minerals is
limestione, which is a byproduct of *sea life* (calcium carbonate
skeletons of sealife settling to the bottom as sediment, and then
getting turned to rock).

Also, wood and even stone *will* be shipped. We\'ve got lots of
perfectly good stone in our state (Oregon) much less in the US. Yet the
new Federal Courthouse uses *Italian* marble. Why? Because it\'s
considered more "beautiful" than anything native. And many countries
import exotic woods and the like. Ebony, mahogany, etc. 

So you\'ll have the "luxury" and "fine goods" trade in even "raw"
materials. Worlds with some types of atmosphere may produce some
wonderful types of rock that look *really* nice. Even if you have to
coat the finished wall/tabletop/whatever with plastic to protect it
from normal atmosphere, there\'d be a market. 

And on the world\'s without limestone, *marble* will be equally
non-existent. So it\'ll get imported for fancy stuff. Heck, even things
like *granite* come in enough varieties that some may be worth shipping.

Some of the low tech/low pop worlds with decent atmospheres may be
logging camps (but with more care about renewal harvesting practices).
Or be like the Hudson\'s Bay Company and be trappers/hunters for furs
(or even for medically useful animal parts). 

And there will be drugs and spices to be found. These also don\'t
require high tech or high pop to harvest. A lot of folks who don\'t
*like* "crowds" or high tech or otherwise "don\'t fit in" would likely
emigrate to this sort of planet and enjoy living by hunting, trapping,
or gathering plants in the forests/grasslands/swamps/whatever. 

Mind you, these folks probably have a radio that can reach to the port
(for emergencies) and can get an air-raft for med-evac if they are
seriously injured. And likely have home entertainment cemters too. But
they *live* off the land, and sell the stuff that gets exported so the
can have these "luxuries". 

"That a new Disaster Area video?"
"Yep"
"Ok, I\'ll give you 5 ounces of heavenspice for it."
"10"
"6"
"9"
"You have any idea how long it takes to collect this?! 7, and that\'s my
last offer..."
"7 and a half, and throw in that Squink pelt."
"Damn robber...." <hands over the spice and pelt> 

:-)

And yes, they *could* sell the stuff the gather and then pay cash. But
the type of person who likes that sort of like tends to prefer
haggling. So the storekeepers will accomodate them. Besides, by not
having prices posted, they can more easily "skin" visiting starship
crews. :-)

Oh yeah, while you can\'t feed a planet on imported food, you *can*
supplement their diets. For example, you\'ll note that fruits tend to be
imported from long distance with a *far* greater frequency than
vegetables. That\'s because fruits tend to have more "taste appeal", and
that due to the way most ripen, they\'ll ship better. 

But foods tend to be lighter than most raw materials. So that makes
foods, softwoods, and especially natural fibers ideal for "topping
off". They\'re also worth shipping if you have a small, valuable cargo,
and want something cheap to fill up the hold. 

So you\'ll have batches of offworld fruits and veggies showing up on
ships and winding up on the shelves in the larger stores. If enough
folks like them, they may actually wind up being worth shipping in and
of themselves. At least until someone figures out how to cultivate them
on planet. 

Traders *live* for that sort of opportunity. Create a new market and
serve it until the big boys get interested and buy you out (it\'s
generally easier to buy a Free Trader\'s contact to supply such things
than to waste time causing "accidents", you might screw up the market
for the goods that way). Then you go looking for a new opportunity.

Thus, you will see some *strange* stuff gettiing shipped. Mostly due to
things like some trader needing to get rid of that last 1000 credits of
local currency before he lifts (*Never* take local currency off planet.
By the time you get back the stuff may be worthless, and paying to
change Imperial credits into local and then back again is *stupid*
because there\'s a "service charge" each time).

Great. Want to give us Traveller stats for type L stars of various

BTW, I was wondering about the "4.5 million degrees" that was mentioned

A white dwarf is more like a few *dozen* miles across IIRC. Jupiter is
near the maximum size for a non-star. You add mass to a body like
jupiter and it starts getting *smaller, because the core goes
degenerate, and thus takes up a *lot* less space. It\'s not until the
mass gets high enough to sustain hydrogen fusion at the core that the
body expands again (due to photon pressure).

So the maximum mass for a type L *would* be just a hair under that
required to ignite as a M dwarf. 

Wouldn\'t *that* be something to be close too. I wonder how long it\'d
take from the start of fusion until the star starts expanding?

Fungal problems (and the related things like "yeast infections" are
rather different than bacterial infections. The fungus/yeast is using
you as a food source, in the sense of it\'s not really "aware" that you
are even alive. It just treats you like another source of food. That\'s
why they tend to be external or restricted to areas where the body\'s
immune system doesn\'t have free access (like the brain and spinal
cord). That\'s because they are generally "easy meat" for the immune
system.

Fungi are somewhat more likely to be able to attack off-worlders
because they are in general looking for "simple organics" or complex
organics they can break down. So they aren\'t as likely to be affected
by biological differences.

Giardia is a parasite, IIRC. That is, it\'s multicellular. 

Bacteria "know" that they are feeding on something that will fight
back. So they have various defenses, such as secreting toxins (which
are what tend to make use sick). In other cases, like gangrene, you are
back to the fungal model of something eating stuff where the immune
system isn\'t working well.

So we could get *some* bacterial infections along the gangrene model,
but more normal infectious bacterial diseases are unlikely as they
won\'t have the right defenses, and will not be able to find the sort of
cells they normally prey on. They are as apt to *starve* in a human
body as to be recognized as foreign and removed!

Actually, we can\'t cure *any* viral disease. Zip, none, nada. We know
how to *prevent* them by vaccinating, but that depends on finding a way
to introduce something into the body that will sensitive the immune
system to the virus, but *not* give us the disease.

But once you *get* a viral infection, all we can do is provide
supportive care. We are *trying* to find things that\'ll destroy virus
without killing the patient, but it\'s hard.

You see, viruses aren\'t "alive". Instead, they are chunks of genetic
code sometimes with a protective protien coat. What happens is that
when they contact a cell, they get inside, and like a virus program on
a computer, they hijaak the cell\'s machinery and turn it from producing
the things it normally does to producing more virus. 

So the only time you can get *at* a virus is while it\'s outside a cell,
and at that time it isn\'t *doing* anything. 

But *because* of the way they have to be able to fool the cell into
thinking that they are part of it\'s normal "programming" they tend to
be very specific. 

Oddly, this doesn\'t mean that they can\'t cross species. But they can
only cross to species that use the same "key" that they imitate. So the
flu can cross between humans, some birds and pigs. It can\'t infect
rabbits, or lizards. 

But on another planet the odds are *definitely* against compatible
viruses.

If they are correct, these are caused by prions, which are an odd sort
of protein that can self replicate give the right conditions (which are
found inside some parts of a living body). 

These are a weirdy. Prions might exist on other planets that could
infect us. As you note, it\'d be hard to get infected, but it\'s
definitely *possible*. But it\'d be a weird case.

So by my figuring, #1 is fairly likely, but pretty easy to treat. #2 is
less likely, but treatable *if* you are familiar with it.

#3 and #4 are pretty unlikely. In the rare cases where they occur, you
may have *real* trouble.

airways swell up to the point of closure, or entire body systems shut

In _Gateway_, some explorers came back to their lander just fine.
Within minutes they were itchy. Then their lungs started producing

Allergens could easily affect humans entering a non-terran environment,

Here\'s an idea, what with all the mass climate change El Nino stuff
we\'ve been seeing: planet is colonized, a large percentage of the
original colonists suffer frequent flu and cold symptoms. A rash of
Sudden Infant Death syndrome cases amongst infants born during the
first few years of the colony cause concern, but seem to taper off.
Over the next few decades, the colony grows and slowly starts to
develop offworld trade - since it is so undeveloped, few traders go
far beyond the well-developed startown.

Then a climactic change occurs, part of a long-term cycle. An allergen
that was always present in low levels (and caused the original colonists
some trouble before they became acclimated to it) suddenly rockets to
massive levels. Most of the colonists are immune. All the offworlder
scientists at the Imperial Ecological Field Station have an itchy throat

offworlders off-planet, an obvious move by anti-Imperial rebels?

Keep in mind that this is all a matter of *probabilities*. Things like
genetic drift are *statistical*, and in small populations weird things
can happen. 

It\'s *unlikely* that a population of 2 can be viable. It\'s not
*impossible*. It\'s thought that cheetahs may have gone as low *one*
breeding pair in relatively recent times. They\'ve recovered nicely,
though they are so genetically uniform that if a disease crosses over
to them before they get some diversity back, they could suffer a
massive die-off.

Small populations are notorious for loss of genes and the resulting
rapid genetic drift. One of the old Pohl/Kornbluth novels ("Search the
Sky"?) had this as a major background element. On one planet a
substantial chunk of the population had lost *all* genetic diversity.
They were essentially clones of each other. One interesting consequence
was the effect when they invaded the other group on the planet. Picture
the reaction of your average soldier when he kills one of the enemy at
short range, and the next one to charge looks exactly the same....

It also works in reverse too. Somebody *thinks* it\'s a bluff but the

Except that it is established that with *careful* calculation (ie
military convoys) the ships arrive over the course of a couple of
hours. 

Normal jumps are plus or minus quite a few hours. At a typcal orbital
velocity of 20 km/sec, a planet moves 72,000 km in the course of an
hour. That\'s 9-10 diameters for an Earth sized planet. 

Also, since the planet is not only moving, but it is moving in a
*changing* direction, if you match velocity based on your expected time
of exit, and come out early or late, you\'ll be going in the wrong
direction too. For earth I come up with 2.5 minutes of arc per hour. 

At least the relative velocity of the stars at the start and end can be
treated as constant. :-)

The rules give differing durations. Starship operator\'s manual give 168
hr +/- 10%. That\'s a spread of 33.6 hrs. And since you are *attempting*
to hit the midpoint, that means that you could be 16.8 hours early or
late. 16.8 hrs is almost 40 minutes of arc, and 1.2 *million* km from
where you intended to be.

You seem to have a mistaken impression. You don\'t exit jump through any
action of the crew. You *enter* jump deliberately. You come out
automatically, regardless of any action takenm on the ship *short of
blowing it up).

So while you may be able to tell when you will exit jump *after* you\'ve
entered it, you don\'t know beforehand. It depends on variables that
aren\'t well understood.

No. Again, you miss the important fact. You don\'t know how long the

That\'s nice. Pity the *rules* say something different.

I suggest that you check the State Department\'s web pages. They have a
rather extensive list of places that they recommend you don\'t visit, or
that they advise you to be *real* careful about visiting. 

It doesn\'t take a full fledged war for there to be a significant hazard
to visitors.

Yeah, that worked *real* well in Somalia. 

You have to realize that most famines are due to the local government
deciding that they don\'t want to let relief supplies reach an area
suffering a drought or other source of crop failure. And they\'ll get
*real* upset with anyone trying to get food to the "rebels" in those
areas. 

Or they want a cut of the supplies, or *large* "handling fees" to let
the supplies move from the port.

Wanna bet? *They* may have developed immunity. Or some local factor may
keep the disease dormant until you leave the planet (a premise Murray
Leinster had great fun with).

What\'s the fact that you can\'t come out closer than 100 diameters have
to do with it?

Consider the case where the planet is moving at right angles to your
jump. Regardless of when you exit jump, you won\'t be too close.
Instead, if you come out at the 7d12h you specify above, you\'ll be 100
diameters away, and right where the planet is. If you come out earlier,
you\'ll still come out at the same point (relative to the star) but for
each hour earlier, the planet will be 10-20 diameters farther off to
the side. 

Here\'s a diagram that may help. 

early                on time                 late
|                       |                       |
C B A 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C 
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+







*                       *                       *   <-100 diameters out
^                       ^                       ^
|                       |                       |
- -12 hours               7d                      +12 hours

Now do you get the picture? Assuming you aim for where the planet will
be in 7 days, you\'d come out at the middle asterisk. If you aime for
7d12h, you\'ll come out at the one on the right, if you aim for 6d12h
you\'ll come out at the one on the left.

It should be obvious that the best place to aim for is the middle one,
because *on average* you\'ll have the least distance to go. 

Note that this diagram assumes that the planet is size 8, and moving a
bit over 20 km/sec. It\'s not that hard to draw up similar diagrams for
other size planets and other orbital velocities. But this suffices to
give the basic idea.

For other parts of it\'s orbit the line representing the planet\'s
positions will be tilted at various angles. But that "jump for the +12
hour position" trick only works when the plent is moving essentially
*straight* away from you or towards you.

Little known fact. *Men* get yeast infections. But on men, they tend to
be asymptomatic. But doctors finally realized this was why some women
would get recurring infections that kept coming back as soon as they
quit treating them. They were getting reinfected by their husband or
boy friend!

I agree.  It seems some people have a vision of the Imperium
where you have to have all your papers checked all the
time and you have to drive on the right "side of the space
lane" and you have to file with the IRS every year, etc.
Its not my vision of the Imerpium.

(I also agree with the ides that it wouldn\'t work all that
well to...)

IMO the simplest way to explain the rules for how a jump works is to

phenomenon that reaches into jump space, namely gravity. So why shouldn\'t
you be able to aim for a point relative to a specific gravity well?

That reminds me of a problem I\'ve had with my detailing of planets. Just
when does an area become uninhabitable without advanced technological
help? I have this TL 4 planet where the summer daytime temperatures
reach 70 degrees Celcius in the tropics. Wouldn\'t that be too hot for
the normal person to handle.

Actually, there is really two questions: At what temperature can a human
live (ie. be born, grow up, and have children) and at what temperature
can a human live for a time (ie. travel across)? I realize that TL will
enter into it, but can anyone give me some ballpark figures?

Hmmm... I suppose it also makes a difference whether we\'re talking desert
or jungle.

It\'s extremely unlikely, but I believe that it is _always_ possible,
if you have a chance of getting one at all. You don\'t get to the point
where you get the +1 to the Benefits Table without collecting more
than 9 rolls.

Of course, the crucial difference lies between getting it 4 and getting
it 5 times.

Interesting if you fiddle up some improved maintenance and breakdown
rules. Otherwise it wouldn\'t make much of a difference in gaming terms.

I think your information about that may be slightly out of date.
I talked about that with my sister, who is a doctor, after the point
was raised last time, and since then she\'s given me two or three
articles from her medical journals detailing cures for various viral
infections. Nothing spectacular, but they were viral infections and
it was cures, not prevention. I\'ll see if I still have the articles
lying around somewhere.

Well, the calculations I made and posted two weeks ago (with several
assumptions that may not be true) came to MCr10 per 100 T of ship the
shipyard is to be able to handle. This is for the capital investment
alone and does not include salaries. Nor does it include any cost for
transporting the machinery from the production world to the Secret
Pirate Lair.

As for the difference between building and maintaining a ship, the
capital investment would be the same. You are just able to spread
the recouping of the investment out over 26 ships/year when you are
doing maintenance.

She might be referring to Zovirax(?) which is used in the treatment of Herpes et 
al. While it is a truely remarkable stuff, its not a "cure" as such. It works by 
suppressing the virus during its acute attacks. It does not however directly 
affect the virus which still remains in the infected nerve cells; more it forces the 
virus back into its dormant stage. But it has to be applied almost immediately 
the outbreak occures (within a few hours). It is however one of the most 
promising recent develoments in antiviral work

One of the most enduring designs to come out of the Interstellar Wars, the
Tracy class were a general purpose tramp freighter serving the many colonies
of the Terran Confederation. The design outlasted the Confederation by a
considerable margin, examples of the class were being constructed in the
Solomani Rim well into the Long Night. The class displays the usual massive
structural strength found in Terran ships of this era, being capable of
withstanding up to 15g\'s of stress. The distinguishing features of the design
are its large dual story cargo bay occupying the forward 22.5m of the ship,
served by a single large 12m x 5m cargo ramp; the small fission reactor (as
against the large fusion reactors found in Vilani designs); the closed loop
biological life support system; and the 30Mj point defence laser. In order to
maximise the designs cargo capacity, the ship is only fitted with a 75Mw
fission plant, whilst the ships theoretical maximum power usage is 115.83Mw.
The result of this is that whilst using the ships thrusters the Contragrav,
fuel purification and cargo handling equipment must be taken offline. Since
these items are usually not in operation while the thrusters are online, this
rarely causes any difficulties.

Assuming for the moment that this is not too far off, then 
what is the profit margin on you average ship? is it 10% or 
is it closer to 50%? If I\'m building a series of 200t 
freighters, at what point does it become more profitable to 
buy the hardware (for 20Mcr) and build them myself than to 
pay the Mcr35 or so for a 200t J1 Ship? What about for a 
60Mcr J2 ship? Is it two or three?

Ok, assuming that you want to recoup 3% Return on
Investment on your 20Mcr which is doing maintenance on 26
200t Ships per year, then you need to score about Cr
600,000 per year in profit. or about Cr 23000 per ship,
plus wages, spare parts and suck like - On a Mcr 35 ship 
you\'d be recovering 35000 per maintained ship, so 12000 of 
that is likely to be costs directly associated with 
servicing the Ship. However if you maintain a J2 ship which 
costs 60MCr then you\'re getting kCr60, of which either the 
costs of servicing are KCr37, or you\'re making more profit.

I think perhaps that the maintenance fee should be related 
to things other than the cost of the ship ("I\'ve just added 
a 10Mcr Laser turret, damn, now checking the Jumpgrid is 
going to cost me an extra 10,000 Cr per year" - seems 
strange to me.)

What about basing it on a percentage of the Jump Drive1, 
multiplied by the Size of the Ship (Big ships have more 
surface to examine)?

You\'ll start getting some variation as soon as the breeding population grows
enough and background radiation mutates a few genes.  The longer the timeline,
the more variation.

It\'s a canonical handwave.  You can\'t keep your jumpbubble/wormhole/whatever

This assumes that vector & speed as well as orientation are somehow \'locked 
into\' a jump and that the jump itself is a straight line.  I don\'t play it 
*quite* that way.  IMTU, vector & speed, referenced to the galactic core, is 
constant, but you can fiddle with the calculations to drop you at any point 
you want on the 100 diameter sphere.

Given constant accelleration M-drives, orbital speeds of 20 km/s are trivial 
to deal with, as long as your speed is low.

There\'s more than enough oxygen in the powder to sustain combustion, and
the only real problem I would see with an open system would be full auto
fire.  Using a sealed, caseless design (like the G-11) would end that problem.

Ammo stored in vacuum might case degrigation of the propellent after a
time, but I imagine that special vacc-ammo would be produced.

Humans have thrived at very low TL\'s from -40C (Siberia, north slope
Alaska) to +40C (Sahara, Australian Outback, American Southwest).  Much
higher, and unacclimated people start dying of heatstroke very quickly.

Humans adapt quickly, however, and within a few generations you\'d find the
population becoming more suited for the enviroment.

Not really.. heat is the problem.  High humidity makes it more likely to
notice that you are getting heat sick due to nausea, disorientation, etc.
In a low humidity situation, passing out is usually the first (and last)
sign of trouble.  Water discipline is just as important in SE Asia as it is
the Kalahari desert.

The powder contains both propellant and oxidant.  Remember, the casing is

The bullet would seal the muzzle, allowing the gas ports ot operate.  The 
problem would be, if the weapon were in vacuum long enough for the gasses 
trapped on the working edges of the weapon to outgas.  This would increase the 
friction, possibly causing a jam.

I may have mentioned this already, but a veterinarian friend of mine says
that cheetahs are so alike that you can do organ transplants between them
without worrying about rejection.

I prefer to think that you can sense gravity while in J-space.  Then you make
tiny course corrections as you feel around in the dark until you think you\'re
at the right location.  You\'ll probably feel the star\'s gravity ramping up
first.  Then you start poking around at an appropriate gravity level (read:
distance from star equal to destination orbit).  When you find a saddle
point, you know you\'re close to an orbiting body.  You follow that up to the
danger level (read: if you continue at jump speed, you won\'t have enough time
to react and may crash into a planet).  Then you kill the engines and
precipitate out of J-space.

This allows for exploring new systems where you have NO information about
orbiting planets.

Sorry, but all that\'s required is that the time between when you leave
point A and arrive at point B be *less* than the time light takes to go
from A to B.

If you combine this with light speed communication to someone moving at
sufficiently high speed, they can get a message to A before you left.
It\'s kinda complicated, but it is a consequence of the *geometry* of
spacetime, especially the way it changes as relative velocities
approach c.

Allergens have one thing in common. They are all proteins. What\'s going
on is that either they closely resemble something that your immune
system *has* to react to, or for many people like me we got exposed to
something in such a way that our immune system got overly sensitized to
it. 

Desensitization consists of finding an amount that\'s small enough to
trigger a minor reaction, but not large enough to trigger a full
fledged attack. You expose the person to the small amount for long
enough and the immmune system will finally decide to ignore it. Or at
least, not to overreact so badly.

Even if Georgia did have the same sort of soil (and I\'m sure that some
of it does) it doesn\'t get *deep* frosts. The ground has to freeze
*hard* and do so to a depth somewhat *below* the stones for the field
to "grow stones".

A modern airliner can practically fly itself too. Nobody let\'s them do
it except in emergencies or under supervision.

Think of the automated systems as having "skill-0" (or maybe even -1)
in the various skills. Only the desperate will use them without skilled
humans watching them.

Some types of integrity tests (especially for pressure!) are not the
sort of thing that you want to do just anywhere. The pressure tests
involve pumping things up to *above* normal operating pressures. This
puts a lot of stress on things so you only want to do it occasionally.
Also, if a compartment (more likely "section") of the ship *fails* the
test it\'s going to do so catastrophically (as in chunks of pressure
bulkhead flying around). Best to have shipyard facilities to fix the
bulkhead, also to X-ray or ultrasound or whatever the plates after the
test.

Could be he made a mistake along the lines of paying off creditors
while Judge\'s Guild was folding, and not considering that he\'d still
have to pay taxes on the money he was paying them with. That\'s a common
mistake of folks in small business.

So he could have a *huge* tax bill and no money to pay it with. If you

More to the point, novel anitgens will not cause _any_ reaction on first
exposure, unless, as Leonard says, they are quite similar to something else we
_have_ been exposed to.

This makes \'em nastier...

Scouting crew comes back from a nifty nice new planet, ripe for colonization.
They lead the first colonist wave back to the planet. _THEY_ die
gurgling...leaving the unexposed colonists to wonder what the heck is happening...

Not for long, though as the symptoms of anaphylactic shock are recognizable
enough, and treatable enough that people wouldn\'t die so readily, given
competent medical care. 

This is probably one aspect of medicine that even the Vilani are pretty good
at, since exposure to novel protein or protein-like structures will be
commonplace. After all, it doesn\'t need to be a protein to be antigenic,
merely a complex enough molecule to register as \'not-self\' to the immune
system in the appropriate (and still only vaguely understood) fashion so as to
provoke an allergic reaction.

By the time we\'re colonizing other planets, we\'ll probably even be able to
selectively supress the human immune system to prevent the common symptoms of
allergies (he says, having spent parts of this spring sitting in a house with
a case of kleenex, an El Nino inspired bumper crop of weeds, and a nose like a
faucet jammed open ;-)

Giardia is unicellular.  It actually an interesting organism that
is deeply rooted on the tree of life and it lacks some of the
typical features that most eukaryotes posses.

The defenses that bacteria have are a product of adaption.  Extraterrestrial
bacteria should be able to adapt to.  As to starving, bacteria are
masters of biochemistry.  If you have a source of chemical energy,
bacteria are going to be able to feed off of it.  Today bacteria
feed on almost every chemical in the enviroment they can get
nutrition off of.  They can reduce ferric iron, CO2, sulfate, oxygen,
etc.  They can oxidize methane, hydrogen, organic matter, etc.

The fact that the Vilani can live off the their environment at
all shows that it is based on amino acids.  That means there will
be bacteria that can live of of amino acids and hence off of people.

I wouldn\'t go that far.  We have never seen another biosphere.
But it wouldn\'t be suprising if it was true.

Leaving aside the question of whether the rules do address this point...
If a jump exit point follows along with a planet, then they should
be attracted to the gravity well.  Yet there is no problem jumping
into deep space.  It also is simply more consistent with momentum
being conserved wrt a newtonian reference from if the jump point
exit is also fixed to that reference frame.  Finally, having more
slop for error leaves more room for roleplaying opportunities and
reduced problems with jumping in suprise attack, "near c" rocks,
etc.  I don\'t think a  moving jump point is untenable.  I do
think it definately isn\'t _my_ first choice.

Actually _most_ aircraft can \'fly\' themselves, in that they are
aerodynamically stable. Given just about any attitude, they\'ll self-right and
fly straight, which is why the instructions for many air mishaps for small
aircraft is \'take your hands off the controls\', and wait for the aircraft to
right itself. Aerobatic and military fighter craft are different
altogether...they are inherently _unstable_, and require constant control from
the pilot.

Modern airliners can probably _land_ themselves under the right commands to
the autopilot, and under the right circumstances. There was also a recent case
of a small aircraft, taking off, flying around, and landing itself (when it
ran out of fuel). That was one _very_ embarrased pilot! IIRC he was either
warming the engine up or working on it, the brakes failed and he watched his
plane go sailing down the runway and take off...imagine what would happen with
a misconfigured starship with that level of automation...

I know the feeling well. I live at the eastern end of a large farming area
covered by prevailing westerlies. Summer is hell.

I\'ve had hayfever since I was a little kid, and it runs in the family. I
can only presume that either my family\'s genes have something that insists
that grass pollen is evil, or some ancestor got herself allergic, and the
antigens have stuck in the family because they are constantly getting
activated.

  The mind boggles to think what could be done with technology more
advanced than what we\'ve potentially got now. Certainly your typical
conflict-based adventure goes to hell in a universe where everyone
has effectivley unalterable (retinas, DNA) ID\'s recorded.

  This is a big hassle with many of the cyberpunk dystopias on the
market, although most get around it by ignoring the possibility of
systemic intrusion into peoples lives. It\'s hard to say which course
is more unsatisfactory.

  My assumption is to assume (unrealistically, perhaps) that helpful
things like detailed medical data (i.e., DNA) _aren\'t_ on Imperial
ID cards (visas, passports, etc.), although I do accept that the 
latter almost certainly would exist.

I paid $3 apiece for them; the bookstore, after I told them what I wanted

I\'m toying with some mods to the T4 generation system, and want to solcit
some feedback. I have never used T4 before, but played CT long long ago.


1.	Players roll for starting age: 1=14, 2=15, 3=16, 4=17, 5,6=18
	Careers are limited prior to 18, to Army (probably planetary), Noble,
College or Merchant Academy (one penalty per year under 18), Entertainer,
and Rogue. Alternately the player may choose to forgo any career and
instead roll on the Common Skills table once for each year until he is 18.

2.	Free Skills based on SOC and EDU. These are inclusive, so if you have a
"B", you get the skill for both "A" and "B".

	SOC A=Carousing-1, B=Fencing-1, C=Art, Dance, or Music-1, D+=Diplomacy-1

	EDU A=Research-1, B=History-1, C=Philosophy-1, D+=Science or Performance-1

	My goal is to give the characters reasonable skills for their stats
(highly educated people should have certain skills, as should high social
class folks) 


3.	Roll once per 4 years on Common Skills tables for whole career. 

	I want the characters to have a broader skill set, but am wary of this
method. Perhaps instead I could allow the players to choose to take one of
their regular service rolls on the Common Skills tables instead of the
service skills tables each term? I\'ll probably put together an expanded
Common Skills Table, including more skills that I think should be on it,
like Performance. Has anyone done an expanded table of this type already?

	On a related note, I notice that there are certain skills which are too
rare, such as Gunnery, which only shows up on the Navy and Scout tables.
Don\'t the Merchants have Gunners? Has anyone put together a table for
randomly selecting a skill from ALL the skills on the list - it might be
interesting...

(or
>electronic log) that is at least "tamper-evident" (as someone else
put it)?

Obviously the specific method anybody could come up with would be
totally irrelevant in the 53rd century, but here\'s a quick hack at it
in the 20th. The Imperial version would use whatever the equivalent
advanced technology is ...

Transponder could consist of three main components:

	- Black box controller, embedded deep within the ship for safety,
with links into the flight control CPU for data input
	- Three equally spaced transceiver units on the surface of the ship:
allows both 360 degree coverage and redundancy in case of "damage"
	- Carefully calibrated encrypted data links between the controller
and the antenna units

The controller and transceivers are sealed, tamper-evident hardware:
any attempt to open them wipes the crypto portion but does *not* wipe
the log itself. The link between them is carefully monitored. Even
today, we can detect exactly *where* a break occurs in underwater
cable simply by injecting the right signal at one end. An advanced
form of this technology could monitor for most attempts to interfere,
tap, or spoof the connection between the controller and transceivers.
Again, this would be recorded, and would wipe the crypto.

The link between the transceiver and controller would be encrypted
and authenticated using something like public key crypto. Thus,
neither side would contain the info necessary to "crack" the other
side, only to verify the information and commands being exchanged are
valid. Attempts to interfere with the transceiver or link would be
recorded in the log. Attempts to actually crack the controller would
be recorded, and then the internal keys wiped. From that point on,
the transponder is effectively dead: it tells the world it\'s been
possibly compromised.

The actual transponder signals would be more than just the simple
"receive a ping, send a ping" of commercial transponders
nowadays--that could easily be spoofed simply by recording the signal
once and then replaying it as needed. Instead, they\'d be
challenge/response, with cryptographic authentication.  The challenge
would be designed so that no ship ever issues the same challenge
twice, to prevent recording of the appropriate response. Ship name,
internal date/time, and a random sequence would be good. So a
challenge might be something like 

	"Challenge: INS Etro 1103-204 22:11:38.99 XR!@3"

The merchant ship\'s transponder would then respond

	"Response: March Harrier to INS Etro <encrypted>1103-204 22:11:38.99
XR!@3</encrypted>"

The response would be encrypted using the March Harrier\'s secret key
(stored securely inside the transponder controller when it was placed
in service)--hence it can only be decrypted using the March Harrier\'s
public key. The response would identify the Harrier outside the
encrypted block, of course. The INS Etro would then look in its
database, pull up the Harrier\'s public key and decrypt the message.
If the message decrypts properly and matches the challenge, all is
well. The Harrier can then counterchallenge the Etro. However, since
merchant ships probably don\'t carry around data on the entire
Imperial Navy, there\'s probably a standard naval key that\'s used to
generically identify INS ships.

But what if the MH has just entered this subsector from the next one
over? Assuming it\'s been moving fast enough that its flight plans and
ID data hasn\'t made it along the XBoat route and been disseminated to
all official points, the Etro can ask for the public key. Remember,
that\'s the key benefit of public key crypto--the public key is
*meant* to be broadcast.

	"Challenge: INS Etro to March Harrier: Unknown Key"

	"Response: March Harrier to INS Etro: <key data>"

Upon receiving a key request, the transponder would send its public
key. But how does the Etro know it\'s a valid key? Simple, each
transponder key is countersigned by the issuing authority\'s key. And
there wouldn\'t be many of those, and they wouldn\'t change very
frequently, so the Etro will have all of those. It simply checks the
signature on the MH\'s key, verifies it\'s a legitimate transponder
key, and then uses the transponder key to verify the original
response.

There would be a limited number of authorities actually capable of
generating and authenticating the original key. I\'d probably have a
"transponder factory" on the Sector capital, which would produce all
the non-military transponders needed in the sector. They\'d be shipped
to the various shipyards for installation as needed (ADVENTURE HOOK!
this, of course, means there are shipments of valid, unused
transponders to be hijacked, storage facilities containing useful
transponders, etc., etc.--PCs can either be providing security, or
trying to break it, depending on whether you want them to be good
guys or bad guys ...)

Part of the transponder data will probably be easily changeable: ship
name, ship\'s master, etc. But each transponder will have a unique ID
and authentication key. Thus, when the ship is sold and the new owner
renames it, the transponder is still the same. The ship can be traced
all the way back to the original shipyard where the transponder was
installed, much like a VIN.

On the military side, it probably gets more complex. First, there\'s
the generic "Imperial Naval Vessel" transponder code, used to respond
to civilian queries. Then, each ship will also have its own unique ID
used in military to military queries. The Navy will no doubt have its
own certification authorities, probably hierarchical as well.
Likewise IISS. The proper authentication codes may even be changed on
a periodic basis for local operations.

Weaknesses here: well, obviously TL15 computers can be expected to
make small work of 20th century public key crypto concepts. But just
plug in the TL15 version of the same concept.

Physical attacks on the transponder system are going to be extremely
difficult. Not impossible, just Impossible (if you get the
distinction). Likewise, cryptanalysis to try to record transmissions
and crack the private key, or reverse-crack the private key from the
public key (current estimates for the number of calculations required
to crack a high-grade public/private key range as high as the number
of protons in the universe...). Remember, the Imperium relies on this
for all kinds of purposes--the Navy uses it! So the resources
required are going to be beyond even most megacorps. Unless, of
course, you\'re running a "heroic" or "space-opera" style campaign, in
which the characters can accomplish superhuman feats beyond the rest
of humanity.

The weak link (and I use the term weak loosely) is going to be the
inventory transponders awaiting installation. Somewhere between the
factory on the Sector capital, and the ship it\'s finally installed
in, it might be possible to get hold of one. But again, the Imperium
is going to be fairly humorless about security. Think of the
president\'s "nuclear football" (case containing his launch
authorization codes). And even if you get hold of one, how do you do
so without anybody knowing it\'s gone missing? It\'s fairly easy to
disseminate a message along the XBoat route and otherwise identifying
transponder S/N 1230-8892-9945-3240 as invalid.

Best chance: find some government agency which has its own reasons
for creating bogus or otherwise non-normal transponders. Surely IN
does it, likewise the intelligence branch of IISS, and no doubt
others. Either find a reason for them to give you one, or find
somebody you can compromise/coerce into providing it.

All in all, I\'d say they\'re out there--it\'ll just require a lot of
hard work, blood, sweat, tears, and creative thinking for players to
get one, unless your plot requires it (in which case you can just
issue it to them ...)

This could be a real pain in wartime if you get a hit in the transmition
lines. The system thinks it\'s being hacked, goes down and leaves you
looking suspicous in a war zone. Not pleasant.

On Saturday, I finally got hold of _The Weirdstone of Brisingamen_ which
I\'d been looking for for a while

WoB has \'haunted\' me (in the nicest possible way) since I was 10 and I can

Having found little fantasy that I\'ve enjoyed since _Lord of the Rings_,
this may be a \'juvenile\' but is
full of atmosphere, excitement and mythology.

Overheating could be a problem with any automatic or even semi-auto
design. You\'d have to keep the cyclic rate down. One possiblity, since
a gun for use in space has to be able to tolerate low temps and very
high temps, would be to incorporate a small canister of liquid gas (CO2
or maybe N2) into the magazine, and set it up to carry off the excess
heat by running the gas through channels in the weapon and allowing it
to expand. Place the exhaust ports from the coolant properly and you
might even compensate for the recoil!

You shouldn\'t have any more residue problems than you have in air. In
fact, I\'d expect *less* since it\'ll be *easier* for the gases to
escape.

The powder in guns is *completely* self-contained. It doesn\'t need any
outside material for the reaction to take place.

The *big* problem with guns in vacuum is the lubricant!

Without *any* lubricant, metal parts under pressure (as a number of
parts in a gun are) tend to vacuum weld. 

With the wrong lubricant, the volatiles will evaporate, and the stuff
turns into a mess that makes a better *glue* than lubricant.

You also have to be careful about what materials the gun is made of, or
else be sure to keep it somewhere where the temperature is somewhat
controlled. In direct sunlight it could heat to a couple hundred
degrees. Not enough to set off the ammo, but enough for thermal
expansion to *jam* the mechanism.

Left in shadow for a while, it might wind up at -100. That\'s not good
either. Steel gets *brittle* at those temps, and many lubricants freeze.

There\'s a lovely bit in one of F.M.Busby\'s books where a gangster type
has been covering some space crew with a gun. The whole group is suited
up, and they are in the shadow of the ship. One of the crew figures
it\'s been long enough, and goes for the guy. He tries to fire the gun
and it won\'t work, just as the crewmember had figured. Then comes what
he *hadn\'t* figured anyone would be dumb enough to do. The bad guy hits
the gun hard enough to jar the mechanism loose. And the round in the
chamber goes off. But remember that bit about steel getting brittle?
The effects are *worse* than firing with a blocked barrel. The gun
blows up in his hand, shredding it pretty good.

The combustion all takes place *inside* the CARTRIDGE. No external
materials required.

Recoil is still recoil. And gas still expands. But you\'d have to adjust
the mechanisms a bit because the bullet isn\'t having to force all that
air out of the barrel, and the gas will expand out of gas ports faster.

But these should be minor adjustments, rather than calling for major
redesigns. 

See my other posts for the problems due to lubricants and temperature
extremes. 
 
But I expect that any gun that is designed with the possibility in mind
will have no problems. In fact, I bet that most guns produced on worlds
with spaceflight will be designed so they\'ll work under a wide range of
conditions because that makes exporting them easier. Guns might be
rated:

   Pressure (operational): Vacuum to 2 atmospheres
Temperature (operational): -100 C to 200 C
Warning! Weapon is *not* recoil compensated for zero gee use!

I\'m told that the record low in either Siberia or Antartica (I can\'t
recall which it was) isn\'t all *that* far from where you\'d get CO2 "snow"!

Yep. Just *try* living at a high Andean village. You might manage, but
you can\'t have kids (pregnancy is uniformly *fatal* to non-native
women). It takes generations of slowly moving higher up the mountains
(and losing a fair percentage of mothers and babies to health problems
brought on by altitude) before you can claim to be able to live there
rather than merely visit.

I rather expect that there are planets with "thin" atmospheres that
were settled by Andean Indians and by Himalayan/tibetan natives. By
Millieu 0 they\'ll be doing ok. But the typical visitor needs a
respirator to feed him oxygen. 

These folks can get by on about 1.5(?) psi partial pressure of oxygen. We
need 3 psi. It\'s likely that it\'s possible to go a bit lower, but I
doubt you\'d get below 1 psi, even after generations of adaptation. 

For high pressure atmospheres, you need to keep the oxygen percentage
*down*, as oxygen quickly becomes toxic at higher partial pressures.

Somewhere I have a reference for the book/paper that covers the limits
of the human body (from an Air Force study back in the 50s).

It\'s to hot to be very *active*. It\'s *not* too hot to survive. (158F
for those who care). There are places on *earth* that reach 130F and
the unofficial record is above 140.

What makes more of a difference is the humidity. In high humidity, you
have to be *very* careful, as sweat quits evaporating, and that means
your body can\'t cool itself.

Two other very important factors. What\'s the average *daily* temp, and
what\'s the average *yearly* temp?

If you dig down a ways, you can reach soil that\'s at the average
*yearly* temp. Build your shelter that deep, and you\'ll be ok if that
temp is more reasonable. But that\'s pretty extreme.

If the average *dialy* temp is more tolerable (ie hot days, cold nights
as is typical in areas with low humidity and no cloud cover) you just
build using *thick* walls of stuff like adobe. By the time the heat of
the day has worked its way through the wals, it\'s nighttime and the
heat is welcome.

Note that *both* of these dodges are TL 0!!! Though admittedly, the
first one is a *real* pain without decent light sources.

As far as *low* temps go, There\'s no reason a TL 0 culture such as the
Inuit (Eskimos) couldn\'t survive all the way down to the point where
the oxygen starts to liquefy. There just have to be animals and plants
for food. And it would be best if there are plants available at least
part of the year, as well as more "normal" temperatures. 

Actually, now that I think about it, they might run into trouble about
the point where CO2 starts to freeze out. They\'d have to be *really*
careful with exterior temps that low. CO2 freezing could block the
exits from the igloo, and they\'d have to be careful to get water ice
not "dry ice" to melt for water. Bring the wrong kind into the igloo
and kill yourself.

It might be possible to survive at even lower temps, given supplies of
food and fuel. The most extreme case is in Fritz Lieber\'s short story
"A Pail of Air". It has folks surviving on an Earth that\'s been thrown
out of the Solar system. They\'ll die when all the supplies within
walking distance are gone, but since they were in New York (back when
coal was the most common source of heat) they\'ll last a while. It\'s
worth reading for ideas.

Please do check. I rather suspect that they are like the "cure" for
folks who can\'t handle the old rabies vaccine. They found that with
proper supportive care, you *can* live through rabies. But it\'s not
really a cure. You still have to go through the full disease. :-(

That\'s a *really* uncommon situation. Remember, *we* can\'t detect
planets within 6 parsecs because all we have in space is the Hubble
telescope, and it doesn\'t allocate that much time to it. Any starship
will be able to make observations as good as the Hubble\'s, maybe
better. 

And *real* observatories, out in the outer reaches of a system, using
(say) 10 meter mirrors will be able to plot planets on the other side
of the sector!

BTW, it\'s canonical that you have a fairly good chance of detecting
planets several parsecs away. Several of the old Alien Modules have a
section on exploring uncharted space. And it has you detecting planets
out to 3 parsecs, with some chance of not finding them (actually, of
not finding the *star*!).

Are we stretching to keep the rule or what. What if there already was a
hardpoint socket there. According to all pictures of lasserturrets they
are retractable, and this is the position they will be inn when in jump,
so there is not really a new surface feature, as the turret doors had to
be there as part of the socket.

I\'ve come up with an idea that may at least complicate the life of future
law enforcement agencies: The Anonymity Virus. It\'s an artificial virus
that after injection makes its way out into every cell and goes dormant
until the cell dies whereupon it activates and destroy the DNA of the
cell, making it useless for identification purposes. A more advanced
version substitutes another, specific DNA sequence. I was going to write
it up for GURPS Bio-tech, but didn\'t get around to it. I don\'t know just
what tech levels and prices I would assign them in Traveller terma. TL 12
and 14 perhaps? The same cost as any other artificial virus? One problem
with the idea is that I haven\'t been able to come up with any legitimate
reason why any honest citizen would use such a thing (So far the best I
have come up with is some sort of religious injunction), so carrying such
a virus would propably be a criminal offense in itself.

Wasn\'t there a huge debate here recently about how miraculous it was that we
have just now spotted something as huge as a brown dwarf?  And if scanning
distant space is so important, why isn\'t there a sensor check in the jump
procedures?  There\'s no way you could scan something like that precisely enough
from 9 light years away. Your data would be out of date and you couldn\'t be
sure enough about the distance to compensate.

That would work too, but the standard explanation of how a jump drive works
has it that all calculations are done before you enter jumpspace and that
no corrections are made while in space.

Canon is clear on that point; you never risk crashing into anything. You are
always precipitated out at the jump limit, willy-nilly.

A workable, but non-canon, jump drive.

You can do that anyway. You simply aim at the star instead.

I have had conversations regarding starting age possibly being variable under 
certain circumstances, but I wouldn\'t make it routine. Certain desired 
backgrounds make it suitable and maybe such a roll could be allowed at 
referee discretion, or roll 1D6 and a roll of of 6 or 5/6 allows you to roll 1D6-2 to 
determine how many years early the character hits their career.

I\'d go along with the careers selected, except that college should probably only 
be allowed early with a certain minimum intelligence level, probably a very high 
one.

I\'d be very careful with this. T4 already gives characters an almost insane 
amount of skills in comparison with CT, less so in comparison with Adv MT 
generation. This applies to points 2 & 3, as well.

Such a table might well be dangerous. Under what circumstances might a 
Scholar or Entertainer learn Gunnery? Merchants probably should be able to 
gain Gunnery skill. So find something that is duplicate on a table and insert it 
in its stead. No game comes off the shelf perfectly (no, please don\'t start on 
T4\'s faults, it has its share, maybe more than its share, but thats not what I\'m 
getting at), be prepared to tweak, as your whole post is about. Just be careful 
of wholesale changes.

Good excuse for an honest citizen to use an anonymity virus: uniqueness
protection. A society that can gengineer an Anonymity Virus can
also make clones, if they can get a DNA sample. Let\'s say you don\'t
want another you that can pass all your bioscan security wandering
around. A police state wouldn\'t allow citizens to do this, they\'d try to
control illegal cloning instead.

Another reason for an honest citizen to have this virus: they don\'t know
they have it. A libertarian, criminal, revolutionary or simply anarchic group
disseminates the virus, making themselves unidentifiable and concealing
which people they are by making millions (billions) of other people
unidentifiable as well. I imagine a police-state society that depended
heavily on DNA-identification being devastated by a sudden anonymity
plague.

"But I AM the Grand Imperious Leader!"
"NEGATIVE IDENTISCAN. INTRUDER ALERT. FULL TERMINATION

This virus may have a very limited TL window for effectiveness. One
TL low, and DNA scanning isn\'t used...a TL or two higher, and biosample
scans may happen so quickly that the cell doesn\'t have a chance to
die. A hair higher, and biometric scanners may be able to scan DNA
without even taking it out of your body, at close enough ranges (like
having your hand stuck inside a scanning pod).

And heaven help you if the dormant DNA-destroying virus mutates, and
decides to munch amino acids _before_ the cell dies. Owch...

Yeah, but I was under the impression that a great deal of the heat
generated in a conventional firearm went out the ejector with the shell
casing. Specifically my question was referring more to caseless weapons
than vaccuum weapons. :-) What is the current real-world status on this?

Again, I was more referring to caseless weapons than vaccuum weapons -- I
was also under the impression that a lot of powder residue went out with
the shell casing. :-) I was told that test model G-11s had a problem with
fouling (when compared to similar conventional weapons).

The info on purpose built vaccuum weapons was interesting, though not quite
what I wanted. Of course, since this isn\'t the "ask Mr. Wizard" list, I
suppose I shouldn\'t complain.

ObTrav: I asked recently "Why does the ACR in Megatraveller have a smaller
ammo capacity than a standard, lower-tech assault rifle?" I was wondering
if there was some reasoning behind this. The only list response I got was
that it was to make the rifle lighter, because weight in a weapon was very
important. However, I am quite certain that there are better ways to make a
high-tech rifle lighter than cutting the number of rounds in the magazine
(superdense instead of steel, lighter composites in the stock, etc.). And I
question the assumption that the benefits of a lighter weapon outweigh the
benefits of having an extra 10-20 rounds or so in each magazine (especially
it\'s only a question of several hundred grams for the extras).

So I ask again, why does the ACR in Megatraveller have a smaller ammo
capacity than a standard, lower-tech assault rifle? Was weight really the
idea (especially when you consider that the weight of a personal weapon
means nothing in the MT game mechanics)?

blah blah before... blah blah before... What are we firing a cannon or flying a

Well, I prefer to think that is a safety device.  At jump speeds, a nano-second
too late would put you inside a planet. And it ISN\'T that clear... i.e. say your
ship is destroyed, couldn\'t that  just as easily occur after the jump than during
or before?  It certainly doesn\'t say WHEN that jump mishap occurs.

Cannon drives <pun intended> aren\'t  very well defined.  Thus anything defined is

Very true... but I\'m doing that with all jumps.  Point at star then search.

Check out my tirade on starport traffic:

metronet.com/~washi/Tas/Calida_Orbital/

	RobNJonStarport.html

and an old script which needs updating:

	starporttrade2.html


I assume 95% of all traffic stays in orbit, while 5% of the
traders with ships 1000t and under will land.  95% of the
traffic can get pretty rough, but I assume a world with stats
A888888-D, with one neighbor one parsec away with similar stats
will have 

	182 traders landing per week
	3640 ships in orbit per week

	217 passengers throughput per hour
	36,493 passengers throughput per week
	
The groundport only needs 1 landing strip, and has 1 parkbay for
shuttles and 16 parkbays for traders.  2 shuttles are needed:
one 100t and one 1000t.

The orbital port, then, needs to talk to, register, patrol, and
perhaps offer terminal service to 3640 ships, plus it needs bays 
for the two shuttles.

I assume maintenance and construction hangars and drydocks will
only service a few hundred tons, so say a few thousand tons
displacement for them.  Not big at all.

Tell me what you think...

Most of the usefulness of such devices goes out the window when your
players visit a world at tech level 7 or less.

For more technologically developed worlds I see several liklihoods;

1). A device two or more tech levels higher than local TL will overpower
most local security (I am assuming that the person using the device is
trained in intrusion and computer here).

2). Many important systems on lower tech planets will have imported
advanced seccurity systems in place to specifically guard against #1.

3). It comes back to talent and opportunity.  A trained hacker in the right
place with the right access can get what they want, if they are lucky.  A
less skilled computer user will not be able to find the right approaches.
I think a hacker almost always needs the combination of intrusion and
computer to \'break\' another computer to their will, unless some other
preparation has been done (stealing the root password is a good start).

For rules, one task is too few.  I had the idea once of adapting NetRunner
(A collectible card game) to hacking in traveller, but this requires a lot
of game time and isn\'t as easy as I thought to implement.

I usually settle on two primary tasks, but make the #1 roll truly
impossible until  some preparation work has been done (study the stolen
software code, grab a user access password, break in to get direct terminal
access, etc.)  I use current computers as metaphorical equivalents since
that is a realm we are all familiar with.

At the time of success of those rolls, the person has "root" and can do
what they please.  There is the possibility that someone will figure out
how to (physically) cut access or activate anti-hack countermeasures, or
otherwise \'shut down\' the hacker.

A very neat idea, and I think it would be quite easy to insert into a
campaign. The Solomani are generally agreed to have superior biological
theory and technology as a benefit of having developed science and
technology on the same world they evolved. CT Solomani government is also
intrusive and paranoid enough to have developed the technology for certain
of their agents (domestic or international). Once the existance of such
technology becomes known (even SolSec can\'t keep absolute secrets) the
MegaCorps would covet it. They too are involved in many activities which
they either do not want to be associated with or want to frame someone else
for.

Thus, I see this technology as being extremely illegal (posession is
considered proof of criminal or treasonous intent) but prevelant enough
amongst the big criminals (government agencies and megacorporations) that
small criminals (player characters) have a reasonable chance of obtaining
it.

It would not exist in I1, I2, LongNight or M0 (low tech and insufficient
paranoia on the part of the ace biologists) and would be exceedingly rare
in TNE (information might be slightly more common but available tech might
be insufficient to implement). Late I3 would be fertile ground for this
sort of thing.

I have concerns about the effeciacy of contaminating _every_ cell in the
body, but if we can have jump drives we can be allowed some hand-waving in
biology. Two points affect the game: Time is involved in full infection so
anyone using this tech would need to keep a stock of anonymous and imposter
agents on hand or allow for a delay in plans. DNA scanners in security
systems could be configured to look for the presence of the dormant virus.

One could definitely have a system that can\'t have entries altered by having
transponder queries from other ships include a digital signature with an
encrypted time; you\'d need the other ship\'s private key to fake such a 
message. With sufficiently complicated private keys these would be 
unfakeable. If every system has a traffic control radar that is continuously
pumping these messages out, you could tell everywhere a ship had been - 
deleted signals would show up as obvious gaps in the log.

I\'m at work right now and don\'t have my T4 manual with me (shame on me),
but I don\'t recall the skill description for Intrusion saying anything
about computers. Mostly it is for burglary if I recall correctly. I don\'t
think tying the skills of burglary and hacking together makes much sense,
as the sets of people who have these skills are often very different.

You could create a separate Computer Security skill if you wanted, but I
think that anyone with sufficiently high Computer skill will know the ways
to circumvent the systems they work on (the backdoors).

IMTU, they are among the better long term conspiracies.  They have only one
major goal - maintenance of the TAS way of life, the selectivity, and the
freedom/privilege of the gentlemen adventures who make it up.  As a result,
much like Jane\'s of today, they pay in hard Imperial credits for anything
the Scouts, the Navy, and the BIA can tell them, and pay even better for
local agents on every planet to send them on the scene information.

As I said in my post on the subject, as technology for crime prevention
has advanced, so has the technology to get around it.  If something
stands in the way of ciminals and their money they will find a way
around it with new decryption methods, ways of getting past the
safety devices on the transponder, etc.  No body has ever made
a security system that there wasn\'t a way around and nobody has
ever made a bomb (or any other device) that could be diffused
(ie gotten around the security devices).  The real world doesn\'t
work that way.  As the technology increases, more tools become
available for security systems, but more tools become available
for contravention of security systems.

But you also need to plug in TL 15 decryption concepts too.

I think that Entertainers could conceivably come by a great many
non-entertainment skills. The nature of their work is by definition not
regular, and they probably do just about anything to make a Credit
inbetween gigs.

But more generally, I think it is interesting to have one or two "odd"
skills in a character\'s mix. Most people don\'t fall neatly into one
career\'s skills. How diverse is the mix of skills among members of the US
military? We could probably find any skill on the list among that
population, right?

I\'m not saying that all the character\'s skills should be random -
focussing them on a more likely set of skills makes sense - but I think
there should be one or two rolls that might come up with anything, and the
player has the chance to be creative about how they came upon that
particular skill.

Any input?

I should have mentioned it was a personal \'hack\' of the Traveller (in my
case Mega-) system rather than a rule from a book.

The Megatraveller description of Intrusion skill says "The Individual has
experience in clandestine methods of acquiring goods that belong to others.
An individual with intrusion can pick locks, open locked safes, and
pockets."

I agree that computers aren\'t mentioned specifically.  However, I do not
think that computer skill alone is enough (The description if the skill in
Megatraveller is silent on this point).  The skill "computer" covers
network administration, hardware repair, and programming in one fell swoop.
While this is not necessarily completely crazy (esp. at lower levels) it
does seem excessive to include skillfully circumventing computer security
systems as a primary aspect of this skill.

Adding a seperate skill is always an option, but it has the problem of
adding that skill to the character generation process, and that\'s not as
easy.

Let me mention again that this is a personal IMTU hack and I\'m not trying
to say any of you should do it.

  That\'s quite a neat idea, although you might need to make it nanotech;
IIRC some tissues are already "dead", and having your hair/skin disintegrate
would be a noticeable side-effect, so you\'d want a more sophisticated
control mechanism.

In all of the 11,000 worlds of the Imperium there\'s bound to be a world
somewhere where privacy is considered a very important right. On such a
world a virus like that would be a perfectly legal way for a citizen to
protect his basic right. The more advanced version could well still be
illegal, but the first version might be available over the counter in any
chemist\'s shop. 

I\'d make it have a limited duration though so PCs couldn\'t just load up on
it a go on a crime spree through the surrounding sector, because they\'d
have to come back periodically, and the Impies are bound to keep an eye on
repeat vistors to that planet. This can be justified in game terms either
by mumbo-jumbo, techno-babble, or by saying that the manufacturer does it
on purpose to encourage repeat business.

As you might have guessed I like this idea.

The recent versions work fine. Both problems were solved by switching from
normal rifle propellant to high explosive mixed into a stabilisor that
gives it rigidity and moderates its burn rate. This gives a cleaner residue
that doesn\'t foul the chamber, and a higher ignition temperature, thus
removing the risk of cook-off.

Excuse me but if you are programming the jump and you know precisely where
you will enter jump and you select precisely your exit point then you can
calculate precisely when you will come out.  There are a great many
variables (like you stated) that can\'t be factored in and that is why the
rules are written the way they are.

That doesn\'t mean my theory is incorrect and it is in keeping within the
GUIDELINES of the written canon.  I never said that there wouldn\'t be
fluctuation (of up to 48 hours) BUT I tried to give a better accounting of
that time and why it is the way it is.  My INTERPRETATION of the 168 hours
plus or minus 24 is in keeping with the best Traveller traditions.

Say waht you will but I will repeat my thoughts again.  The closer the
physical distance is between jump entry and jump exit should reflect in the
lower time limit in jump space and vice versa for the greater distance.
Doesn\'t this make much more sense than just telling your navigator "well let
me roll the dice and see how close you get" (or some other nit noy comment).

I don\'t think I ever said that it didn\'t work that way at anytime.  What I

such a high tech undertaking.  Not trying to change anyone\'s mind or rewrite

What rules are we talking about.  I never offered to change the rules, just
gave another interpretation of them.  You know that they are still doing
that with ALL the religous works today too.  Does your game master let you
run his/her game, do you try to correct any infractions of his/her
interpretations AND I don\'t believe that there is a point in our current
science that says I\'m incorrect in my interpretation.  In point of fact, I
might be closer to canon than you.  My way allows you to exit jump space at
a pre-selected location which is what you would do when jumping into the
voids.  A jump one ship needs to go jump two, he throws in some fuel pods,
calculates his jump one, does the jump, refuels, calculates his next jump,
jumps.  Seems to me that IS in keeping with Traveller canon.

I also read the first few pages of MOST of the Traveller books and you know
what, almost to the "t" they had something posted in them that read
something like this; "This book is offered as a guideline to help you run
your game." or something extremely close to that.


Pity you\'re so closed minded about this.

This has gotten me to thinking, whatever happened to Reference, the
computer complex maintained by the IISS?  IIRC, it was supposed to be one
of the largest computer complexes in known space.

I think you\'re going the wrong way around.  Have the player work on
the character conception *first*, including skils they particularly 
deisre.  Use the tables to guide when and where they pick them, and
then fudge the dice if they don\'t work they way you, the DM, think
they should.  The play is the important thing, not the rules.

As i read the orignal post the anonymity virus destroys the DNA in a cell
upon that cell\'s death. Thus the physical characteristics of the now dead
cell would not change; your hair and outermost skin would _look_ perfectly
normal but contain no readable DNA.
Some points:
  It is essential to be infected with the virus long enough before the
illegal act for all hair and dead skin tissue to be replaced. (Shaving the
head and scraping the skin would speed up this process, but not to zero.)
  The virus must destroy DNA almost to the atomic level. Merely broken
genetic sequences, even severely fragmented ones, can be reassembled like
jigsaw puzzles. In fact, this method is used in present day gene
sequencing. See "The Code Breaker" by James Shreeve in Discover, May 1998,
p45-51 for a good laymen\'s discription.
  DNA identification is most often applied to hair, skin, blood and semen
samples.
  I\'m not sure a virus can infect germ cells. I certainly don\'t think it\'s
a good idea. Therefore, infected men would _not_ be anonymous if the crime
were rape.
  The DNA security system would read dead tissue as anonymous, live cells
(e.g. blood) as infected, and germ line cells as the true identity.
  Evil thought: how about a security system which extracts a sample known
to be \'honest\', the germ cells (sperm and eggs). Ouch;)

It certainly seems much simpler to wear a sealed environment suit to avoid
contamination. Rather obvious though in non-hostile environments. IMHO
there is no legitimate use for this technology. Police techs and others
would wear anti-contamination garb. Only covert (illicit) activities would
benefit. So, definitely illegal, no exceptions.

Actually, killing yourself with carbon *di*oxide is quite hard. The gas
causes a natural panting reaction in humans which usually leads to an
"I\'ve got to get out into fresh air" response. The main killer is pure
nitrogen, followed by carbon monoxide (very dangerous but fairly
uncommon) and pure oxygen.

Nitrogen does not trigger *any* response in human lungs, so you can
breathe it until you pass out from lack of oxygen to the brain without
any "warning signs". Then you have about three minutes to live unless
someone hauls you into oxygenated air - being careful not to fall into
the same trap as you did (this is deadly serious - many workers in the
chemical industry have died this way and these days we take the threat
*very* seriously). 

Carbon monoxide takes the place of oxygen in the blood, but doesn\'t
provide the same benefits - the end result is as for nitrogen but the CO
can be mixed in just about any atmosphere as it gets taken up in
preference to oxygen (or, rather, it gets absorbed in ratio to its
concentration but does not get desorbed in the same way that oxygen does
so it builds up in the bloodstream, stopping oxygen being absorbed).

Oxygen is intoxicating to breathe, but most injuries and deaths I have
heard of stem from clothes or other "fuel" becoming drenched with pure
oxygen and then getting set alight. A standard boiler suit can burn
completely in *seconds* if it is soaked in pure O2, which means it burns
*hot*.

Not yet - Someone on the TML was writing a program that took sector listings 
(such as those included in Galactic 2.3) and turned them into postscript.  I do 
not think the program is finished yet, as I never noticed an "I\'m finished" 
message.

My own Win95/NT program, written in Delphi, will (once I\'ve finished it) create 
"proper" maps in a range of formats - including 1-page = 1 sector and 1 
landscape page = 1 subsector + UWP listings (like the original Spinward Marches 
little black book).  Work has been keeping me busy enough to drain me of time 
and energy for the last six months, but soon I hope to get back on the case.  
I\'ve sorted out nearly all the thinking required, and just have to do the grunt 
programming.  The approach I have used for map symbols is to create a TrueType 
"Traveller" font that contains symbols for bases, planets, asteroids and so on 
that can be used for on-screen and paper output.  The advantage of using a font 
(like the postscript program, above) is that the image quality improves with 
bigger and better screens and printers, rather than being stuck with the 
limitations of bitmaps.  Basic colours to match the old GDW colour maps are no 
problem, even two colours for terran worlds is possible (blue on green or 
green on blue).  The bitmap method used in the Dulinor Suite (and others) 
generally looks better on screen at the moment, but that may be due to my 
own artistic limitations!

I have an old effort by a TML\'er on my web site that turns out very nice
postscript maps. It doesn\'t take Galactic files but I have included some
Basic code to massage the \'Genie\' sector files into the right sized and
sorted chunks.

I agree with you, but I have to ask why you\'re even bothering to roll at all

Great idea, Hans. When I wrote up the Zoetec gene-scanner, I was worried
about how I might put it in my campaign without enabling all high-tech
governments to snoop on their citizen\'s movements virtually all the time.

This sounds a lot like the government\'s reason for denying strong
encryption to the public: "who but a criminal needs it?" Apparently they
think only criminals need privacy, therefore nobody should have a right to
it. But in fact everybody needs the right to go unidentified and anonymous
much of the time, for reasons other than hiding criminal activity.

Those who say that honest citizens don\'t need privacy or anonymity probably
aren\'t:
        - gay (or other oppressed sexual minority)
        - HIV-positive
        - radical political activists
        - members of unpopular religious sects
        - ex-convicts
        - Salman Rushdie
        - in a witness-protection program
        - alcoholic
        - sexual abuse survivors
        - stalked by a violent ex-spouse/partner
        - harrassed by fans or paparazzi

Indeed, when it comes to protecting their privacy, most people just aren\'t
sufficiently paranoid :)

	Sure--no system is perfect. But any damage to the transponder is
going to leave you looking suspicious anyway.Simply taking out the
transceivers antennas, for example--they\'re surface features,
probably not well armored (they *do* have to be able to radiate ...).
There would have to be a standard signal you could send claiming
transponder failure. Then, if you\'re really behaving yourself and
following directions *exactly* (lay in *this* course, shut your
engines down, reduce power to minimum ...), some flyboy will come by
for a visual ID. Then a brave soul with a bomb strapped to his chest
will board you and verify your ID that way. Further steps as desired.

	I did make perfectly clear that it wasn\'t *impossible*--I agree
completely, there\'s absolutely no way to make a perfectly unbreakable
system. Doesn\'t stop anybody from coming up with something that\'s
"good enough." Banks get robbed; I don\'t stay awake at night worried
about my money. Brakes fail; I still drive faster than 5mph. You
could rob Ft Knox if you figured out the right way. But the
likelihood is low.

But how can a world like this enter the Imperium, when in the Imperium you
have no privacy at all. At least that is the way most on this list view
the  OTU. The use of transponders on all ships, logging of all ship,
passenger and cargo traffic at starports. How many people would go along
with this? If this is the way the Imperium works then it is bound to be
hundreds or thousands of liberation groups out there that fight this Big
Brother for freedom, free speach or what ever. There you have your
pirates, cosairs, free traders. They\'ll be people that will do anything to
make the Imperiums work that much harder.

But then you\'ll have people on this world that will hate the Imperium for
keeping such a close eye on them. And these people will do what they can
to make the work of the Imperial attache that much harder. How long is the
Imperium willing to go, socially and economically in their quest to keep
everybody and everything under observation?

I don\'t know about caseless weapons, but I *do* know that a lot of the
heat gets conducted from the casing to the receiver, and from the gases
to the barrel. Every semi-auto I\'ve ever fired gets uncomforably hot
after firing a magazine or two. There\'s a *reason* for that wood
"forestock"! 

Heck, my measly .22 rimfire is quite warm after firing the 20 or so
rounds the tube magazine holds.

Could be. But that\'d be more of a case of the casing carrying away all
of the *minimal* fouling that a given round would leave in the
receiver. With caseless, that small amount stays there and would build
up until it interferes with chambering the next round.

The residue from a single shot is prety minimal, even in the casing.
But let it build up and you are in trouble.

Consider that weapons such as the SKS only hold 10 rounds. Yet they
remain both popular and practical. Why? I\'d say at least partly because
it\'s actually *easier* to load from a "stripper" clip than to change
magazines. And you don\'t have that big magazine getting in the way
(trust me, a 30 tound magazine *does* get in the way when going thru
brush, or especially if you are trying to use the weapon while prone).

Stripper clips are also *cheaper* than magazines. And you can get more
ammo per box that way. 

I think the main reason that the AK-47 (which is otherwise a *lot* like
the SKS) has the 30 round detachable magazine as standard is because it
has full auto as an option. Full auto is ok for area suppressive fire,
but wastes bullets.

Do note that in WWII and Korea the standard issue weapon was *not* full
auto capable. And that while the M-16 *is* there\'s a lot of debate
about how useful it really is to have this capability in every grunt\'s
weapon.

That\'s because they are *harder* to spot than stars or even large to
medium planets orbiting stars.

Normally you\'ll be using info from the "charts" (actually a database
much like the Astronomical Ephmeris or Nautical Almanac, but more
extensive). Any observations you make would merely be a quick sighting
on some "guide stars" to confirm that the ship is pointing in the right
direction.

Actually, you can measure the distance *very* accurately. You just take
sightings from two different "hexes". Add in a bit of trig, plus the
(known) locations of those systems (either from the charts or from your
own prior observations and or visits) and you can pin down the star\'s
position pretty well. And doppler shift will give you the "radial"
velocity (ie how fast it is moving towards you or away from you along
your line of sight). That lets you compensate for the distance it has
travelled in the intervening years.

Planets *do* require several observations either over months or from
different hexes to get a rough plot of their orbits. But it\'s still
doable. 

Also, if you have time, but are short on fuel, you can get the required
"long baseline" simply by coasting at high speed over a few AU before
leaving the system. At a mere 100 km/sec (easily achieved by most
ships) it takes 41.6 days to cover 1 AU. And during that time you can
refine your observations of the system you are leaving. So it\'d
definitely be worthwhile for a ship exploring "uncharted" systems.

Alas, the way the "heat lock" (the entrance tunnel and associated
structures) in the typical igloo is built, it\'s the *lowest* place in
the igloo. This is so that cold air stays there and hot air doesn\'t
leave via it. So guess where the largest CO2 concentration would be?

Luckily, nitrogen has a boiling point *lower* than Oxygen, so you won\'t
get liquid (much less solid) N2 until after the oxygen has liquefied.
This is why they try *not* to have LN2 in wide containers open to the
air. They learned the hard way that after a while the nitrogen has
evaporated, liquefying an nearly equal volume of oxygen. And LOX is
dangerous!

More correctly, CO binds to hemoglobin strongly enough that neither
oxygen *nor* CO2 will displace it, except possibly at *very* high
partial pressures. So once a hemoglobin molecule has latched on to a CO
molecule, that molecule is *useless* for O2/CO2 transport until the red
blood cell it is in is recycled by the body. Which takes a week or two.
That\'s why CO poisoning is *cumulative*. Any that gets absorbed *stays*
absorbed for weeks.

Considering that some mines use cotton batting soaked in LOX *instead*
of dynamite, I can only agree!

Still, it looks like it might be fun to write about a neolithic culture
living on a planet where the *summer* temps are way below zero, and the
winter temps approach the point where oxygen liquefies. 

Don\'t make the mistake of trying to sell the natives steel tools. At
those temps steel is as brittle as glass. I think special alloys might
work, but I suspect that simple *bronze* would work well enough.

I scanned and vectorized much of the MT logos into .wmf format.
You can fetch them at my website. There also are the Megacorp logos along
with some services and most of all factions.

I coloured some of them, although most of them had been black and white
only. When I\'m able to convert them innto .eps format, I\'ll add the files

But you shouldn\'t look suspicous, because if you are fool enough to

Nothing was written about Reference/Cadion (Core 0140) in the New Era,
which is a shame since it was right next to the HubWorlds pocket empire.
It\'s safely outside the Black Curtain, although it\'s only a handful of
parsecs from the "event horizon".

On the other hand, I had some interesting ideas what Reference might be
like in the New Era, post-Virus.  Maybe if I have time in the next few
days I\'ll write them up and post them.  We\'ll see.

Apparently the Smithsonian Institution uses an Imperial sunburst as their
symbol as well.

My favorite of the sunbursts they use (and the one I\'ve expropriated for my
web page) is http://www.nmnh.si.edu/images/si_btn.gif
The same on a black background: http://www.nmnh.si.edu/images/sibutton.gif

Actually, the *simplest* solution is likely the best. Have the entries
logged on some sort of "write once" media. That means it\'s *impossible*
to alter the data in a meaningful way (ie, you can possibly change
zero bits to ones, but it\'d be rare that this would be at all useful). 

You *could* copy the media up to the point you wish to alter, and fill
in fake data from there on, but that gets rather complicated,
especially if the recorder automatically logs the insertion of media
*to* the media, or refuses to accept anything but blank media (you can
get around either, but it *does* complicate things).

If the media has an inherent limit on write speed, and it\'s not too far
above the rate that data is recorded at, then it becomes impractical to
tamper with the media, because it\'d take so long (picture the problem
if you need to make an "edited" copy of a log with six months data on
it, and it\'ll take 3-4 months to write it!)

This sort of thing would make logs "secure enough" for several tech
levels. And by the time they become non-secure, you\'ll have a new
technology. 

You can\'t make it *impossible*. The idea is to make it take enough time
or money to be impractical.

I just checked and it\'s not a Hugo winner. It\'s also not in the
2-volume "A Treasury of Great Science Fiction". So I\'d suggest checking
collections of Lieber\'s short stories, and also the annual anthologies
for Analog (and the Astounding ones that preceded them), and Galaxy and
F&SF collections. I\'m pretty sure it appeared in one of those three
magazines as they were essentially the entire market at the time.

I think there\'s a web site that can do searches for that sort of thing,
but I don\'t know the URL.

Great. You *do* know that there are one or two "sequels"? I can\'t

The problem is that a virus *requires* the cell to be *alive* for it to
do *anything*. So if the cell is dead, the virus can\'t activate.

On the other hand, it might be possible to build a gizmo that is
"tuned" to some sort of "resonant frequency" of DNA/RNA. It\'d force it
to break down into the raw sugars and amino acids. It\'d probably
denatured most proteins too. "Denatured" proteins tend to crosslink and
otherwise stiffen/coagulate. When you cook an egg, the protiens in the
wihte turn white and firm because they\'ve denatured.

This would make a nasty, if shortranged weapon. Any part of the body
damaged by it would be somewhat like hard rubber/cooked meat in
consistency, and could *not* be "repaired" it\'d have to be regenerated
or replaced. And of course, if you do it to something like an upper
arm, the lower arm will die too because theres no way to get blood to
it. God help you if you get a hit that cuts across your abdomen or
chest. Head hits are instantly fatal, of course.

But besides being a useful weapon, it\'d be good for eliminating
evidence. First you play it over the body at full power, which
eliminates all hope of using DNA, blood types, cell types, etc for
IDing it.

Next you turn the power down a bit and sweep it all over the crime
scene, and keep sweeping it around until you reach a public area.
There\'d be a good chance it\'s ruined any DNA you may have left behind. 

Reaching into my memories of some old SF and a couple of obscure
SF-RPGs, I say we call it a "Stokes Coagulator". It needs to be limited
to short range, and of course, it\'s *highly* illegal. Which just means
that it\'ll be found in the possesion of crooks, on Law Level 0 worlds,
and in the possesion of goverment agents. :-)

At first I thought it\'d be a great weapon for defending high security
areas in secret government installations. Then I realized that the
*last* thing an intel op wants is a weapon that not only kills
infiltrators, but makes them harder to ID!

Oh yeah, something like reflec (ie a suit of "tinfoil") could likely
provide a defense against a coagulator.

Anybody have suggestions regarding size, weight and TL?

Lots. You might want to check into the sort of records kept at airports
and seaports *now*. *Every* ship and plane is recorded. And commercial
carriers keep passenger lists. Also, airlines are doing checks on
passengers to screen for potential hijackers/terrorists. 

As for transponders, not everyone goes for the "they record everything"
bit. But transponders as a (relatively) unforgeable ID isn\'t all that
far fetched nor is it any more of an invasion of privacy than license
plates on cars or registration numbers on aircraft.

Hell, much of this will be driven by *owners* and by insurance
companies! They have goofd reason to want to be able to track these
expensive objects and the goverment would go along as it gets some
benefits also.

I don\'t have my copy of T4 with me either.  I don\'t think you have to 
tie the intrusion skill with burglary.  Intrusion could just be the 
familiarity with security methodologies and the way to circumvent them.  
This way it could be used with any number of other skill rather then 
having to create a new skill every time to want to fill a new niche.

As it happens I\'ve just finished cataloguing over 1500 of my SF short

_A Pail of Air_ (no doubt in any number of anthologies) was published in
Galaxy in December 1951.

It\'s in (and I doubt this is complete):

It was also on the radio (presumably in the States) in 1956 and it may even
 be possible to buy a copy
of the recording if the following web site I only had the briefest of looks
 at is anything to go by:

Bleh..didn\'t mention it before, but I checked my own math, and I miswrote in
that post (I was working from something else where I got it right, not sure why
I made that mistake).  1 kN should use 28 liters/week (2 kG/week), not .28 --
so 1 ton of fuel per 500 kN per week (or 1 ton of fuel per 83000 kN per hour). 
Still better than HePLAR, but your average ship probably has a fairly low
endurance (assuming 10 tons/dT and 1% fuel for 1g, it\'s only 8.3 hours of
thrust).  Aside from high-speed interplanetary travel this is tolerable (it
does mean that it\'s faster to go from primary to gas giant via microjump unless
the 100 diameter limit for the star intersects your jump path).

It hasn\'t been posted or webbed yet. It\'s been discussed on the trav-tech
list; I\'m tweaking based on early playtesting before I post it to the whole
TML. I\'d be happy to send copies to anyone on TML who\'s interested, though.

Major features include
- -use of a (new) clean log scale for weapons ratings (which makes treating 
rapid fire weapons and large squadrons very easy - a squadron of a hundred
fighters just fires like one fighter with a +6 on its attack)
- -scaling that works from small ships to large capital ships
 through grouping weapons into batteries
- -non-ablative armour 
- -several layers of optional rules to make things quicker or more detailed
- -heavy weighting given to skills/crew quality
- -abstract (high-guard-esque) movement (but could easily be slotted into a
hex system like RPSC or BL/BR/mayday.)

Overall, I think it strikes a good balance with being more detailed than
Battle Rider, more accurate/modern than High Guard, and quicker than 
Brilliant Lances (though not as detailed as the latter). The major goal 
was to make a "High Guard" for T4/FFS2...the working title is a tossup 
between "Military Combat System (MCS)" and "Fusion Guard".

I would offer up my feeble views on the designs and Lab Ships in general.

Disclaimer: I am a participant in the THUDDD competitiion, so of course many
of these views I used in my own design. However, several of these ideas I
_did not_ think of (I wish I had), and thus I didn\'t use them.

First off, I think all of the designs submitted were quite good. In previous
THUDDD competitions, I thought some of the designs (including my own, in one
case) were lemons. While I may have my favorite(s) in this competition, I
think that all of the designs were excellent and would serve as fine lab
ships.

Bruce Macintosh\'s design addresses the most serious problem of lab ship
design: What is a lab ship? An archaeological ship is different than a
survey ship is different than a stellar observation ship is different than a
asteroid geology ship is different from a zero-g laboratory is different
from...etc...His use of modules, while somewhat wasteful in space and money,
is the obvious choice for the ultimate in configurability. Personally, I
think his design is the best (mine own included) overall, although I think
it might be a little pricey for smaller groups.

The rest of us went for the "jack-of-all-trades" design...a ship that could
service just about any scientific task, although dedicated ships (or modular
ones like Bruce\'s) would out-perform them.

All of the ships had sensors, of course, the cornerstone of a lab ship
(along with the labs). Most of the ships stuck with 5 labs, in order to make
room for the additional equipment. Kudos to the design that managed to
squeeze in more...

Most of the ships had around 1G acceleration...a few had more. Personally, I
think more than 1G is excessive for this type of ship, but there could be
specific instances where more acceleration would be helpful. The jump-3
design was admirable, as well.

Several ships had ECM/EMM/Stealth features, to hide from the natives and/or
reduce emissions that might interfere with experiments.

I was surprised that most ships did not have a dedicated science computer,
but instead relied on the standard 3 computers. I would think you\'d want the
scientists to have their own (so that their stellar atmospheres simulation
wouldn\'t interefere with the fusion plant monitor, etc.. :) ).

For long stays, crew comfort is a must. I was pleased to see that most of
the designs indivdual staterooms, and many provided gyms/lounges/libraries.
Sickbays are a must, especially for planetside missions (weird diseases,
animal attacks, etc...).

Personally, I think that a lab ship (actually, I think that most ships)
needs an air/raft...especially if it is going to be performing dirtside
missions.

Again, I thought all of the designs were quite good, and I congradulate all
of the designers for their work. I encourage all of you on the TML to go to
the THUDDD site and check out the designs.

Also because HST isn\'t optimized for planet detection (no high-resolution
coronagraphic camera, and the "polishing marks" in the mirror (which are
very small, and well within spec) scatter light into a halo that makes planet
detection harder than it could be.

HST can see planets around alpha C. (if such exist; there\'s a hint in some
recent observations) and very young/hot planets in wide orbits (such a
discovery was recently announced, though I have my doubts.)

As Leonard says, big sensor arrays - including those on ships, which can
get much bigger than 10 meters - can detect terrestrial planets quite a 
distance away. I posted some rules for this a while ago (check the 
archives.) There\'s always a chance you\'ll miss a given planet, of course,
because it happens to be behind the star, or because the system is 
too full of zodiacal dust...

NASA has reasonably serious plans for "Terrestrial Planet Finder", a 
thermal-IR interferometer deployed to the outer part of our solar system,
which has a reasonable chance of seeing earthlike planets to about ten
parsecs (see http://techinfo.jpl.nasa.gov/WWW/ExNPS/HomePage.html ).
Traveller starship sensors are orders of magnitude better.

This was done from the ground, where it\'s hard (atmosphere blurs things.)
Also, we\'ve gone from having one known brown dwarf ten years ago to a 
couple of dozen, and once adaptive optics is available on 8-10m telescopes
we\'ll find zillions - and some planets, too. We\'ve also found half a 
dozen gas giant planets around nearby stars, through an indirect technique
that requires years of monitoring.

I use the dice a lot like Tarot cards.  A player with a clear concept is
welcome to just present his character to me, but I often encourage them to
start out with the usual chargen system, and then change any die roll that
does not fit.

For example - 

"Burly Bob is joining the marines!  Uh oh, a 2.  Hmmm.  I want him to have
made it, so instead of joining easily, he had to work at it, including
pestering people, private training, and a few months of bulking up."

"Bob gets six skills the first term from his promotion.  I want him to have
tactics, battle dress, rifleman, and brawling.  He rolled gambling and +1
STR.  I think the gambling does not fit his character, so how about +1 EDU."

And so on.  It lets the players set those things that matter, while giving
plot hooks for the areas of the character concept that have not been
fleshed out.

For my next game, we are using a skill system based on Castle Falkenstein.
Since  it was designed for LARP, it fudges a lot of things the skill
gearheads here would cringe over, but it is pretty neat all around.  There
are only 25 traits, including things as diverse as appearance, physique,
various forms of combat, and various academic areas.  They range from poor
to extreme, and anything below your level is a gimmie, while anything above
is unlikely.  At your level, there is tension, and I usually determine that
to advance the plot.

It is similar in a way to the basic Traveller 1-5 levels, but I like the
idea of a trait that is worse than average.  Most players starts with one
great trait, four good traits, and one poor trait.

How many people travel by commercial air travel in the US and Europe today?
 The checks on movement are quite extreme, which is why people who want to
smuggle themselves into and out of countries IRL use boats or overland in
general.  Since the checks are easier in the TU, it seems likely they are
going to do it.

It is impossible to "slip out under radar" on any world above TL9, given a
100d limit and a half assed sensor platform, which is arguably needed
anyway for traffic control.  Given that, and the high, high value of these
ships, they are going to take loss prevention steps.  Further, anyone
travelling is important, so the authorities are not going to be happy if
those important, rich people vanish.  (This is not just piracy loss
prevention - it includes mechanical failure, accident, and so on.)

When you consider the extreme damage that an armed fanatic can do with a
starship, and the incredible, unbelievable cost of Traveller starships and
crew, along with the astonishing resultant cost of passage tickets, of
COURSE they are going to want to track it.  If it is easy to do, and
expensive not to, then it is a no brainer.  It is the equivalent of
strapping hundreds of gold bars to every learjet, and putting a big
flashing sign on them.

To change this, all you need do is change two economic truths in the OTU.
First, if ship costs drop to a fraction of their present value, then they
come in line with present day ocean travel, and the loss of one is not
something that can fund a full investigation team.  Right now, a very nice
yacht, similar to the one I am considering holding my wedding on (Hey, for
four hours, I can pretend it is mine...) runs you a few million tops.
Stealing it and selling it would not let me live my life in luxury, since I
would be damn lucky to get a tenth of that.

Stealing even the smallest tramp freighter will support a pirate band for
life.  Just look at the price tags - 333K for a modern yacht vs. tens of
millions of credits for a Traveller tramp freighter.

Second, if there is a place for the evil deed to occur, then you can have
unrestricted movement.  By allowing combat in jump, or extending the jump
limit out to Saturn, or something like that, you can provide a place for
things to happen.  You still need people scattered about enough that a good
sensor can\'t spot them all.  If the limit is far enough out that there is
no clear benefit to a main world, then I think you do have it.  There are
people all over the system, and it is a much harder task to watch who comes
and goes.

Sure. Fungi are also (relatively) easy to cure, so while there may

be that hard to deal with.

Yes, but... bacteria on Earth have evolved to consume a wide variety
of substances. My sister & father both work in the chemical industry
and have seen several examples of unintentionally genetically engineered
bacteria being used to clean up toxic substances - in one case there
was an effluent pond behind a chemical company that had been there for a
long time (probably over 60 years) that was regularly monitored. One day
they discovered bacteria living in the pond that could digest some of
the toxic substances (petroleum by-products I think). Thus was born a
new bio-remediation project. If bacteria can do that in less than 60
years, alien bacteria can learn to love humans.

Of course, in general, I agree with you - there will be *some* bacterial
infections, but outside of a minor human racial homeworld, they\'ll be
rare.

Oh yeah. Well, substitute "treatment" for "cure".

Totally. Except maybe on other human homeworlds, but even that isn\'t

Yep.

And this, if I haven\'t already made it twice, is my point. (I don\'t
think my last big post was as clear as it could have been, but if it
was, please just skip to the next message).

Some of the previous arguments about the infamous "Plague of Duskir"
revolve around the fact that it\'s impossible that the Vilani would
_never_ have encountered an alien disease that\'s compatible with them.

Of course they would have encountered diseases - predominantly ones
caused my microorganisms: fungus, bacteria, parasites, etc.

All of these types of diseases are treatable and, usually, curable.
Even  for people with naturally weak immune systems (which the Vilani
may or may not have), there\'s is some drug, somewhere, that you can give
a sick person to treat the root cause of the disease.

BUT! It\'s really, really unlikely that the Viani ever encountered a
virus. Even if they did, they probably sterilized any hosts ASAP. The
concept of immunization is probably totally outside the realm of Vilani
medical knowledge. Up to their first viral contact, they\'ve been able to
cure pretty much everything. Imagine Vilani doctors, desperately trying
to cure people who catch the flu - and given the rate of Vilani
scientific advancement, it might take them a while to figure out that it
can\'t be done.

The Plague of Duskir be damned - given the ease of transmission of
common Terran viruses, combined with slow travel times in the First
Imperium, I\'d be willing to bet that the Long Night was the direct
result of Terrans exposing the Vilani and other minor human populations
to their beautiful assortment of viruses. It\'s hard to continue economic
growth when your population starts dropping off at 5-10% per year due to
the flu, chicken pox, etc, etc.

Most hackers start with the idear "I\'ll hack ****** today" or "who can I
hack today ?" they hack to get user accounts etc via what ever means, once
they are onto the system they try to gain root access, once they gain root
access they try to find computers that are trusted to gain futher access,
generaly within the same organisation. Most hackers hack organisations,
not individual computers within the orgainisation (although you have to
start somewhere). The players would have to hack the orgainsation first,
just to find where the information they are looking for is, then go hack
the correct computer if it is online and turned on. By the orgnisation I
mean the computer network that is part of the orgainsation. (Please note 
the above is a sweeping generalisation, and to start going into specifics
of hacking would take a long time)

>I use current computers as metaphorical equivalents since that is a realm

Could we posibly base it on anything else ? I shouldn\'t think so. The
problem of this is that we ourselves now are only in the infancy of IT.
Computers have only been around for 60 years (discounting Babage),
networks for 20, and intergrated communication for around 5. Whatever
clames that people make about IT in the future will be nothing to what it
is realy like, IT may have no meaning ...

Example, 60 years after in invention of the horseless carrage, say 1900,
if you proclamed that in just 90 years the future of the horseless carrage
was :- 

there would be a horseless carrage, being controlled by a farm hand across
100 acers of seemless field, obtaining it\'s position on the earth, to the
nearest yard, from a network of objects, orbiting the planet outside the
atmosphere, while dispersing fertilizer on the field to the square yard
based on the exact yield of that square yard\'s corisponding harvest last
year, but not nessasarily the last harvest, to the exact amount needed,
the information for which is stored on a machine 10 miles away, which is
not attached by any wires to said horseless carrage etc etc etc etc etc.
You would have been put away for being insane ....

As we are going by todays standards, unless you hack a large orgainisation
who values there data, and works a round the clock shift system
(governments, banks, big multinations etc) and you hack quiet, it may take
a while to be noticed, which may mean you are free and clear with the
data, especialy if you used forged ID to gain a net account, the chances
of physical diconection are small (you lose too many other services),
anti-hack measures are preventative, not active. If you try to activly
counter the hack, such as hacking the system where the hacker is or
denying service to that sight, you are yourself hacking and therfore in
contrvention of the 1983 computer misuse act (UK), although hacking
in self defence has never come up in a court of law, and using violence in
self defence against a violent act is permited, as well as reasonable
force in detention of a criminal, therfore active hacking in response
*may* have a presedence (any computer lawyers on the list ?). But the main
stumbelling block is that you need evidence collected proberly
inaccordence with the law to procecute them, which means you have to let
them hack for a certain time, you then have to trace them to a given time
on a given machine, get a court order and get the police to a machine at
the time when they are hacking you, to arest them, then show your evidence
in cort in such a was as a non IT person (the judge and jury) understands
it.

Sorry I\'m rambling .... but I think the point I\'m trying to make is, don\'t
go by todays standards when thinking IT in Traveller @ high TL, think what
todays standards should be, like tracing a hacker and having him arested
in 5 minets, on a TL9 world or above, apply todays standards to TL 8 etc,
but anything is likely posible in higher TL we have no idear. O and don\'t
let anyone start hacking unless they have Computer 4 or above ...

Simple way:

	use a WORM (Write Once, Read Many) device of choice, tied into the
craft\'s Time-Base clock. While it can be erased, erasure consists of
writing all  "1"\'s to the areas erased... obvious but erased. Put this in a
caseing where the  connectors are behind sealing tape, and the case has an
internal power backup, and has a continuity loop test run through
connectors internal to the case body that connect when sealed properly, and
write an all 1\'s error for each timebase period where the case is opened,
disconnected, or ordered off.

Add to this whole assemblage a dual antenna system; one for actual data,
and one to check the first, again writing a block of all ones on fail, on
it\'s own tracks.

All the above is doable with CURRENT tech, and not overly expensive.

the thing here is that annual maintenance then includes a "Liscenced
Technician" opening the case, replacing the media, and resealing it. Thus
ALL transponders will have a short "All-1" block.

also, keep in mind that you don\'t want to tweak with the TBC. Astrogation
requires quite precises timekeeping. Moreso than any land, air or sea
navigation. The effects of error in time-based location are measured in
kilometers per second of error. So the TBC will probably have very very
careful safeties.

IMTU, one of the first things players do is check their TBC\'s against local
time after jump. One of the important information transport commodities is
the "Bouncing Atomic Clock Set". This is a set of 10 very accurate atomic
clocks all sent on the same route, each on a different craft, and using
error averaging to set the base\'s/port\'s TBC set to match the SS capitol\'s.
Same technique, larger numbers from Sector Caps to all dependant SS Caps.
Multiples are used to allow for jump relativity errors; the more jumps, the
more clocks sent.

TBC\'s also compare to pulsar and cephid variable signals for additional care.

Also, IMTU, all TL12+ computers used for starcraft include a small cesium
decay clock (multiple small sample system, for safety). This provides the
time-index for the navigation software to calculate the location of
destination worlds.

Also, due to precision, and local TBC offset calculations, most subsector
scout administrations run the TBC correction programs, and also, based upon
the TBC of the SS HQ, set the local resurveys to as accurate a data as
possible. Thus the Imperial Coordinated Reference Time-base remains fairly
stable across the imperium.

I think this is the key that I have been lurking for, for my campaign

The example ignores the simplest way of tampering with a transponder (or log),
which is simply replacing it.  Assuming that the distribution process for
transponders isn\'t totally clean (a safe assumption) getting a new one is
simply a matter of money and black market connections.  In addition, there\'s no
way for a recorder to detect someone filtering its _input_ (post-processing can
possibly detect fishy data).  If necessary, an exact duplicate of a log box can
be fashioned.

Forgery is _always_ possible.  It\'s just a question of making it expensive...

The way I see it working, the transponder would monitor the sensor and
communications picture.  When somebody hit the off button for the
transponder, the system would record what was going on at that moment for
later review.  So if the Imperial offcial sees three ships manuvering for
intercept and the surrender or die message, he\'d accept that as a
reasonable situation for turning off the transponder system.

I live in the freest country on Earth.

On my car is an identifying number, which the police can use to,learn about
me.

To drive to work, I must have a liscence to operate my car, which entails
given the government all sorts of information.

To get my job, I had to give a urine sample to prove that I wasn\'t on drugs.

For my guests to get on their flights, they have to show picture ID.

The planes are carefully logged, tracked and checked.

I think I\'ve made my point.

we kind of abstracted and went story-style with things like sensor
ranges, information from sensors, that kind of thing. Probably because
of the space combat games based on the Traveller universe, sensors
got real complicated real fast. Now you can\'t move in an inhabited
system without a sensor array finding you, ID\'ing your ship and
figuring out that your crew needs more zinc in their diet.

A few points I\'ve been pondering, though...

In a JTAS Amber Zone, _The Ship in the Lake_, the characters are
sneaking onto a TL7ish world to salvage a crashed starship. The
balkanized, uncontacted planet is at the height of a Cold War, and an
unidentified starship might be just the thing to set off the war. How do
the players sneak in? "Standard Defensive Shields" on their scout
ship make them nearly radar-invisible, that\'s how.

What are they talking about? No Black Globes on a type-S scoutship.
What else could spoof radar?

How about the famous chameleon coatings on a starship? When you
make part of your ship black, your coating is absorbing visible light...
if the chameleon coat could also absorb radar waves, at least for limited
time periods or along certain faces, you\'d be in business for hiding 
in-system.

Here\'s what I see from this: Ships above the TL needed for chameleon
hulls would be able to spoof passive radar sweeps, and even long
range active radar sweeps. Something more concentrated, like a laser
or energy weapon, would instantly overload the coating it struck, no
protection provided. 

The only way to detect a ship at long ranges is to see it - you\'d have to
have a telescope pointed in the right direction, with the right focus, and
know what you were looking for. Bigger ships would be easier to spot, as
would ships providing a nice long maneuver drive flare. Ships presenting
other types of active emmissions (transponder signals, active sensor
emissions, etc) would also be easily spotted, and neutrino sensors can
pick up a fusion plant if you have an idea where to look.

Treating sensors like this would make the universe a little more interesting,
and a little more dangerous. Big fleets would be noticed pretty quickly,
but individual ships could sneak and lurk - not with impunity, but with
some success. They\'d have to be small, though. And this treatment
wouldn\'t affect active sensors at combat ranges very much, so many
of the combat rules would stay similar. Since it takes big ships in
quantity to take worlds worth taking, the political changes would
be relatively small - and it makes things like spy ships doable, as well
as (shudder) pirates.

Further, making it hard to detect small ships makes all these
sub-1000tn patrol craft more sensible - if you can instantly detect every
threat that comes in-system, you make a few big high-G monsters and
pounce them on the threat when you see them. If you can\'t reliably detect
small ships, you will need small, dispersed patrol craft for system 
control - to improve the chances of one of your ships being close
when you detect an intruder, or when one reveals itself, and to increase
your chances of spotting a suspicious craft. (Note: Most canon
references to space combat & patrol duty seem to have limited
detection ranges as the norm, esp. ref GDP\'s Starship Operator\'s Manual
vol I when the old spacehand relates how his ship lost a power plant
when tangling with a Zhodani vessel.)

Like my idea about a 5000-ton max/Book2 ships TU, this idea would
make the game more character and story friendly. What effects would
this change have on the OTU?

I have it in a Danish translation (guess that doesn\'t help you much), but the anthology where it appears seems to be a complete translation of an english anthology called \'Gates to Tomorrow\', edited by Andre Norton and Ernestine Donaldy. Can\'t give you a publishing date for the English-language anthology, but the Danish one is from 1977.

The is actually the otherside of the coin from predictions
that advancement in technology well render us helpless to
high tech criminals.  The same advancements that make intrusion
easier also makes counter measures easier.

If you look at similar claims for new security technologies that
have been introduced, and why they failed to live up to those
claims (either to make the crimes "impossible" or to make them
so impractical as to be "almost impossible"), you notice the fact
that countering a  security system uses the same technology that
is needed to build it.  It doesn\'t lag a couple of tech levels
behind (even if one could come up with a reason why it wouldn\'t).
The problem with widespread security systems it that, by the same
token, knowledge of how they work (and can be countered)
also becomes widespread.  The only place you can really
have a security that is a class above those trying
to circumvent it is for it to be used only in selected
secret uses.  (And even then you may only be out classing
the criminals an not rival security organizations).

This entire scheme depends on how secure a device is from being
tampered with while in the long term, unmonitored, possesssion
of those tampering with it. Form getting by the detectors that
should show up tampering, to simply removing the record of
tampering after you have opened it, I don\'t think this is
much of a deterant.

Not true.  Only commercial ships are recorded.  Our family
sailed boats in and out of Harbors at Buffalo, NY, 
Oceanside, CA, and San Diego CA without being recorded at
all.  

Similarly, at many airports the tower closes down
and all the staff go home and all the non-commercial
planes and non-regularly scheduled planes land without
being recorded.

The Car I drive doesn\'t belong to me :-) There is no 
official record link between it and me. There are probably 
a few gas stations that could (with the help of their 
security cameras) link it to my EftPos card though.

Yep, but my Drivers ID doesn\'t have a photo, and the

my IRD number on it either).

I have never been questioned about my drug taking habits. 
No one I know has except a friend in the army who got told 
there\'d be another test in 6 weeks and if he failed he\'d be 
discharged.
 
> For my guests to get on their flights, they have to show picture ID.

I never have to show ID except for international flights 
(passport required to board the plane - International 
treaty requirements I think, along with automatic pistols 
on the hips of airport security) My bags never even get 
Xrayed for internal flights. (At least they didn\'t find the 
replica pistol I put in my luggage - and apparently that 
Xray\'s a lot like a real Glock - as a friend of mine found 
out to his embarrassment at a Japanese airport.) I\'ve never 
had carryon luggage checked except when travelling 
internationally.
 
> The planes are carefully logged, tracked and checked.

Entirely likely here, but there\'s no legal requirement for 
me to provide a real name to fly internally (unless I pay 
by credit card whereapon they want to know my creditcard is 
mine). So they may well have a careful record of a fake 
name.
 
> I think I\'ve made my point.

I would have said that you\'ve cast doubt upon your initial 
statement. New Zealand has laws preventing data matching 
between computer databases except in a few limited 
situations. (The Social welfare people are allowed to 
compare their records with a couple of other people.)
The IRD (our version of the IRS) apparently try to 
infiltrate people into the Census processing teams, so they 
can see the raw data for people\'s incomes, as they feel 
that people are more honest with the census people than the 
tax people - by law they\'re not entitled to that 
information. 

A story I heard that worried me about Europe. The British 
army had information that a terrorist was going to attack 
some of their  troops in Germany, in a particular town.

With the German authorities they went through the financial 
transaction records of the town, eliminating anyone that 
used something other than cash to pay their bills. 

They  got down to two suspects that paid everything in Cash 
- - one was a drug smuggler, and the other was the terrorist.

Now that worries me. 

The day I go for a job and the employer says that
according to my bank records I\'ve been spending an average
of $200 a month on alcohol, so they can\'t give me the job,
that\'s the day that big brother will really have arrived.

While the Tek archive may be gone, I have a very solid lead on the entire

Yep.  But since he\'s dropped out of the game, I thought I would protect his

The -A1 was full auto, it was the hardest thing to keep grunts from
switching to rock-n-roll at the slighest provocation.  The M-2 carbine was
full auto, but a glorified pistol in most repsects.  I believe the first
real assault rifle was the Sturmwehr-44, which was the basis for the AK-47.

[list of regulations...]

Depends on what you mean by freedom.  In the US the citizens have the freedom
to require each other to file taxes, get environmental impact statements,
get zonning clearances, etc.  They also have a relatively quick communications
system to support this and a goverment that see individuals as being
important (for both good and bad reasons).  I don\'t see the Imperium
being like this....

A chameleon coating probably wouldn\'t easily absorb radar - among other
things, many radar frequencies are longer than the thickness of the
coating - but one can buy a couple of levels of stealthing for a hull
in FFS2, which generally represents radar-absorbing materials and 
hull shaping, and are implicitly reducing your radar signature by up
to 10^6 (which results in a 30 times shorter detection range.)

Another approach would just be to arbitrarily decrease all active
sensor ranges by a point or two (factor of ten or a hundred). The
active sensor numbers in FFS2 were basically Made Up completely (I\'m
not a radar expert, and I was in a hurry) for balance with respect to
passive sensors - everyone should feel free to adjust them as they like.
Even as it is, it\'s passive sensors that dominate for long-range detection.

The passive sensor rules in FFS2 represent this sort of thing - at low
TLs, passive sensors are all-sky automated telescope systems that
scan every half hour or so. Ships can also be detected (even more
easily) in the infrared by the thermal emission from their radiators 
and even their hull. Countermeasures include shutting down the
power plant and hiding in shadows - or extra-black coatings for hulls,
refrigerated hulls, and radiators arranged to radiate waste heat away
from a given target.

A typical small world might have a PEMS-14 in its traffic control
sensor suite (costs about a billion credits.) It can see a normal
target out to 50 million km. However, a pirate ship might have
advanced thermal masking (reducing detection range by 1/10),
arrive out of jumpspace with its power plant on minimum (another 1/3)
and use agressive baffling to turn its hull to radiate waste heat
away from the fixed sensor - reducing detection range to 500,000 km.
It\'s only the big systems (with a PEMS-15 or so) that can see everyone
everywhere...And you can always have a few systems with extra-thick
dust (another x1/10 or so...)

There are neutrino sensors in the FFS2 errata. They\'re pretty short
ranged.

Well if the 3I is like that then either there\'s an inconsistency in the
canon (and that could never be, could it?), or it wasn\'t like this once,
when it was goobling up sectors at a great rate. IMO it isn\'t like that,
because it\'s not interested in what happens on your world, unless you\'re
into slavery. The Imperials could well have a law that infected persons
can\'t leave until they can get some sort of unambigous ID, though.

business (Starman Adventure Systems) which produced an
Approved-for-Traveller product based on the Duke of Regina\'s 4518 Lift
Infantry Regiment, the Huscarles (see JoTAS #9 feature article). The product
comprised 3 cloth patches (Regina shoulder flash, Imperial Sunburst patch,
and 4518 Regt. Crest) quality-screen-printed in up to 4 colours, plus an
individually-numbered (and thus unique) Military Discharge Certificate
signed by Norris, Duke of Regina (blank so you could fill in your
character\'s details), and an instruction sheet detailing where to wear the
patches. After selling a couple of hundred sets, the last sets (or what I
thought were the last) were "remaindered" to GDW, who handed them out as
prizes at some conventions. Those of you who have JoTAS #20 (page 3) or 23
(page 23) can see our advert or read about us in the Editorial. These sets
have sold subsequently to collectors for up to $50 US; they are VERY rare!

Well, while doing a cleanout under my house a few weeks ago, I found enough
materials in a clean, dry, storage box to make up what look like being the
last fifteen complete sets of the 4518th badge packs EVER. The cloth patches
are MINT CONDITION. The Military Discharge Certificates were an end-run and
are unnumbered, at present. I intend to number them in sequence from the
last sets sold back in the 1980\'s, so the sets will have sequential numbers.

The sets also come with an instruction sheet detailing how the patches are
to be worn on the 4518 uniform ~ this instruction sheet is NOT the
instruction sheet as originally marketed; the original sheet was changed to
reflect SAS\'s "separation" from the nominal "producer" if we produced a
second run of patches, but this never happened. The "Mark 2" instruction
sheet is a reprint from the original artwork, but is still a genuine
accessory to the "original" patch set. 

I am offering these last-ever sets for $30 US (including airmail postage).
IF I GET MORE OFFERS THAN THERE ARE AVAILABLE SETS, I will give preference
to anyone who is prepared to offer MORE than $30 US.

For those of you who don\'t know about the 4518 Regt. I can enclose a copy of
material giving the full history of the Regt. as set out in JoTAS #9, at no
cost, to anyone purchasing one of these last 4518th Patch Sets.

Please e-mail me with your offer.

My system has a reflected sig which is before adding sunlight. In fact my
reflected sig is the same as to hit DM and then modified for stealth etc
depending on what is looking at it.

A way to solve the differeance between passive and active that I use is this:

Signal          Passive                 Active

IMTU this is done by laser/maser links between systems. Sure, the datas
is 3.26 years out of date for every parsec of seperation, but one
channel is an "echo" of the time signal received. The echo circuit is
built with a known, fixed delay. So that you get your *own* time
signal back as a delayed echo as well as the signal from the other
system. With a bit of math (a *real* dumb computer) this gives you the
following: 

1. distance between systems (at moment of echo)
2. relative velocirty of systems
3. "current" time synchronized to their master clock

The nice thing about this is it avoids the rather large corrections you
have to make for the velocity changes of the ships, which can\'t be
measured all that accurately. 

This setup can even incorporate a sort of interferometer for even more
accuracy. 

In any case, you\'d know the distance between the two "stations" to
*meters*. Maybe even better, that sort of things a bit outside my field.

> TBC\'s also compare to pulsar and cephid variable signals for additional care.

This also helps both positioning and time.

But it makes them stick out like a sore thumb in the IR, as all that

IR sensors are the big fly in the ointment for hiding at any TL after

Don\'t forget that in an effleunt pond, there\'s little competition, and
definitely nothing along the lines of the immune system actively
*looking* for interlopers.

BTW, I recall when (after a number of years) we *finally got someone to
look at the jelly-like crud we had been cleaning out of the slurry
hoses in the lapping department for *years* during weekly cleanup (we
cleaned everything on the last shift Friday, and the first shift monday
restarted everything). Turned out to be bacterial mats. The bacteria
were living off the glycerine in the slurry (a mixture of silicon
carbide or aluminum oxide, DI water,  glycerine, and an antirust
additive). And that led to further checking which disclosed that the
entire DI water system was infested with bacteria. Which turned out to
be responsible for some mysterious stains that appeared on the silicon
wafers at various stages in the process.

They had to start doing annual purges of the DI system with 20% H2O2.
That killed *anything*, but didn\'t contaminate the system.

There are possibilities for some nasties in the realm of "just using
humans as food":

1. something that gets into the gut (like E. Coli) but digests celluose
   and releases methane. They actually developed an E. Coli strain to
   do this for methane production and then had to scrap it when someone
   pointed out that not only could it still live in the human digestive
   tract, but given a normal diet, it\'d produce enough methane to
   produce a serious risk of rupturing the intestines (rather like what
   happens to cattle suffering from "bloat").

2. How about something that eats collagen, and does so rapidly? Since
   that\'s essentially what binds the cells in the body together, it
   could get *really* nasty as first your skin and then underlying
   tissue layers turn to "slime" and drip/rub off. Heck, it\'d even turn
   *bone* to a powder.

I *really* like that last one. It\'d require that the local criters use
a different compound, but use small amounts of collagen for something.
It\'d be a "niche" organism that\'d consider Terran animals and plants to
be a free lunch.

And the effects are so wondefully *nasty*. Just the thing to put on
that planet that your players are the first humans to visit. :-)

Actually, that\'s not true.  If your chameleon surface is also a high-efficiency
solar array, some of the energy can be stored/eliminated by methods other than
heat.  Upper limit would represent a reduction of about a factor of 10 in
re-emitted energy (-0.5 passive signature, only relevant to running
powered-down) and require handling around 0.0003 MW/m^2 of surface area (the
0.0001 MW/m^2 in the DSR is an error as far as I can tell, the actual figure
should be about 0.00035), which can be significantly adjusted (+- 50%) by
adjusting the angle of the ship WRT to the primary.

In any case, with the exception of a ship which is being run in shutdown mode,
re-emitted signature is fairly negligible.

    'body' => 'To give the human a role in astrogation, here is my initial
handwave + house rule (bound to be modified based on suggestions 
from y\'all):

The ship\'s astrogation module is interfaced with the passive
sensors (constantly updating) and the shipboard systems which
measure the ship\'s mass, center of gravity, hull stress points,
jump grid stress points, power plant measurements, etc.  All
of this data is wired into an immersive-VR modeling system
connected to the jump drive unit, which provides an interface
to the jump drive controls themselves.  

This network is shielded, redundant, and fault-recoverable
in an astonishing number of failure modes.  The system has generally
been sensitive to the power fluctuations that come from burning
unrefined fuel, so caution is still the word.

The astrogator has several modelling tasks to accomplish in
order to precipitate a jump.

GENERAL RULE

To halve any time given below, increase the task difficulty by 1D.

STEPS

Forming the Jump Sphere.  The astrogator module\'s interface
represents the astrogator\'s perception of the jump route as an
irregular sphere which is formed by the astrogator\'s mind.
This is the jump sphere, which appears as a solid.  It is a
mapping of gravitational forces in the source system down to
a minute level, plus a general mapping of gravitational forces
(down to the satellite level) in the target system.  The ship\'s
computers help greatly with the numbers, including mass
calculations, positions, and vectors.  However, the jump sphere
creation is an action imperfectly done by even the best parallel
processor, which is still no match to the human brain.

	Task difficulty: 1D (10 min) (1d6 possible paths)

	A "10-minute sphere" is standard, and is complex enough
	to hold 1d6 possible jump routes.  One or more of these
	will be viable.  To make a more robust sphere with more 
	possible routes, increase difficulty by 1D and add 1d to
  	the number of routes.

Carving the Jump Sphere.  Using the astrogator\'s trained powers
of jump-space-time perception, a route is carved through the
sphere from one end to another, representing all the twitches
through which a ship is carried through jumpspace.  Multiple
routes and destinations may be carved in this sphere, until all
viable tracks are used.  Quite possibly, two routes to the same
destination may take different times, which the astrogator may
be able to detect.  These tracks decay in usefulness over time.

	Task difficulty: 2D per path (5 min per path per parsec)

Building the Ship\'s Current Jump Model.  All of the ship system
interfacing provides accurate measurements of the ship with
respect to its mass, vector, position, and integrity.  With all
the legwork already finished, the astrogator needs but to form
a jump-model of the starship, which looks more or less like a
cluster of bubbles, or marbles melted together.  This model
decays in usefulness over time.

	Task difficulty: 2D (5 minutes)

Pushing the model into a jump track.  This precipitates the ship
model into the "event horizon" of a given track, which sets the
jump drive parameters and guides the jump drive to send the ship 
to the desired destination.  Failure results in a jump mishap.

	Task difficulty: 1D (1 minute)
	DM: +1 per hour age of jump track; 
	    +1 per hour age of ship model;
            +5 if burning exotic fuel (e.g. unrefined in a non-Scout)
	    +5 if within the 100-diameter limit of anything
	    +10 if within the 10-diameter limit of anything

Verifying successful jump.  The astrogator makes sure the jump
track integrity is fine.  The astrogator should continue to
check until success is made, then a week long rest is called 
for.

	Task difficulty: 2D (1 hour)

You can\'t store it forever, though I suppose you could radiate some of it

The solar input flux ("solar constant") is about 0.001 MW/m^2 (I\'m not sure
where Anthony got 0.00035.) The value in the DSR has been tweaked,
though, to be an "effective" solar flux - ie the level of fusion power you\'d
have to have to produce the same signature. Absorbed solar heat produces
different effects than fusion heat for three reasons: (1) only 10% of 
fusion power plant output goes to waste heat vs 100% of absorbed solar (unless
you do the solar panel trick); (2) absorbed solar heat for ships without 
thermal masking (which includes refrigeration for the hull) is radiated 
uniformly in all directions, as opposed to the normal radiator trick of 
trying to radiate most waste heat away from the enemy; (3) absorbed solar
heat is normally reradiated at about 300K, mostly in the thermal IR, as
opposed to the near-IR radiation of radiator waste heat - thermal IR 
sensor sensitivity is lower for various reasons per watt/cm^2 of target
flux, which makes a megawatt of radiated solar heat harder to detect than
a megawatt of powerplant waste heat (though this is partially cancelled by
2 and 1.) 

(Ideally, I would distinguish between near-IR and thermal-IR, but then ships
would have as many as seven signatures - vis, near-IR, thermal-IR, radar,
LIDAR, neutrino, grav - which is impractical for anything except the computer
game version.)

I recall 0.0014 MW/m^2.  0.35 is because a sphere has a cross-section equal to
1/4 of its surface area, and it\'s cross-section which determines absorbtion.

Backman/Diaspora Date: 210-1118
      Privateer Black Ralph has successfully raided the orbital Imperial
Naval Base at Backman, with support of rebels who had infiltrated the
facility. 

      The privateer\'s ships emerged from hyperspace dangerously close to
the gravity well of backman, deep within Imperial patrol perimeters. 

      This bold stroke allowed him time to disable many of the base\'s
facilities, seize three additional merchant ships docked there, and
effectively limit the Imperial Navy\'s ability to deal with him later.

boggle?  To the best of my knowledge, a fusion power plant produces electricity by
using steam turbines. i.e. you heat up water to steam, then let the steam turn a
turbine which generates electricity which is then stored in an HPG.    IIRC steam
turbines aren\'t THAT efficient.  Simple steam engines are about 10% efficient, I
could see advanced turbines getting better but not 90% efficiency.  Then storing the
electricity will produce waste heat.  Then using the electricity will produce waste
heat... Eventually, it all gets reduced to waste heat, which is the same 100% that
you\'re dealing with in absorbed solar.

Every modern goverment is a police state! It is mandatory to be in
control, to be in command!
( Yes, i know it sounds silly :-)  )!
The goverment use any available means to guarantee stability! Its the microcosmos
( everybodies everyday life) in the macrocosmos ( the big sheme )! As long it is
legal or better as long as i can get unharmed away with it!
The difference to the people is the level of intrusion. The level of what we anticipate!
Enough with this!
What I mean is, as long as the Imperium has the superior means to "control", to govern,
a realm as fragile as houndreds nad thousands of separated worlds, he will use them all
in the extend of not beeing persebtible too intrusive, represive etc.

That\'s no problem at all. This is an artificial virus and it works the way

fine by me. Call it something else. A GEM (Genetically Engineered

There\'s no *way* you\'d get turbines of the size required into the space
allocated for starship power plants. And you\'d lose a *lot* of energy
because you can\'t heat the steam to anything *near* the temp of the
plasma and still use the turbines. That loses you the advantage of a
high input temp.

Also, those turbine would *not* take well to violent maneuvers, bith
because of gyroscopic effects, and because of the stresses on bearings.

Most likely, The fusion plants use MHD generators extract power, then
transfer the remaining heat to the working fluid for the radiators. And
the helium and other waste products probably get seperated out
somewhere in the cycle.

MHD generators are *quite* efficient, and ideal for extracting energy
from plasmas. You run the plasma between the poles of a *strong*
magnet, and draw power from electrodes that are at right angles to
both the magnetic field and the direction of gas flow.

"Fission and fusion reactors use the heat to boil water to turn a
high-pressure turnbine to generate electrical power." p. 65, FFS1

I know its TNE but that\'s pretty straight forward.  Personally, I\'d use the
boiling water to turn an HPG, thus eliminating one step in the power
production.

Look at all the HPG floating about a starship.  I don\'t see them flying apart
when you turn left.

MHD\'s require superconducting magnets which would be incompatible with the
temperatures produced by the plasma.

	Radiate to WHAT? Vacuum neither absorbs nor gives off heat. Heat is
simply random motion of atoms ... no atoms, no heat. The inner
surfaces of the ship would be radiating into each other. That\'s no
good for getting rid of the heat. That\'s also why ribbed radiators
like on your CPU or in your car do absolutely nothing to increase
heat transfer in space--they only help when you\'ve got something like
air or water to carry the heat away by conduction. Radiative heat
transfer is about all you get in space.

today, I discovered an article attributed to Marc Miller at
http://metronet.com/~washi/Tas/House_Rules/Marcs_notes.html

Within that article was the following quote:
"When a vessel jumps it initially uses a large amount of
fuel very rapidly (at low efficiency) to charge up
capacitors to very high levels (that can only be held for
short periods of time).  This energy then "flashes" the ship
into jumpspace where a small continuing fuel usage keeps the
jump field up."

This to me suggests that the process of Jump requires a lot 
of energy and the Powerplant/Jump drive is just a way of 
getting a lot of energy very quickly. 

To me this implies that if you had a significantly larger 
powerplant than needed - say 1000Mw in a 100t vessel, then 
you should be able to jump without requiring "Jump fuel" 
since all the jump fuel is for is to provide large amounts 
of power. With power levels in between meaning you need 
less fuel as a percentage of the volume of the ship.

The article also went on to suggest that advances in
capacitor technology meant that you could use the fuel
from drop tanks to generate the energy, then disconnect
the drop tanks while the energy remained stored. Wouldn\'t
this technology also suggest that you could use your fuel
with slightly more efficiency as you have longer to store
the energy, also reducing the overall amount of fuel
required for jump.

Or should I just accept that this was technobabble to 
explain why the numbers were the way they were and stop 
trying to make sense of it?

I\'ve been thinking. 

IMO the most likely pirate vessel is an armed merchant, 
simply because it can "swim with the other fish", has guns, 
and cargo space to drag the prizes away. I\'d probably put 
fighters on it too, but that\'s not my query.

If the Empire has it so locked down why does the Empire 
allow armed merchant vessels? Either their armament is a 
threat to other vessels (in which case you are making it 
possible for pirates to buy weapons legitimately) or the 
armament isn\'t. If no-one had weapons except the Empires 
Navy, then there could be no pirates - right?

I mean -- who\'d trust a civilian with a nuke det laser? 
after all it\'s not just a missile - it\'s a nuke!

If Piracy is so impossible, then why do most of the canon 
ship designs have weapons? My gut response is because 
piracy _is_ a threat, and the Empire _can\'t_ guarantee any 
vessels safety. 

IMO The details can vary so much depending on 
your assumptions, but the end result has should mesh with that.

I commented on this in an earlier post.  Without trying to reignite the
piracy debate I must say that as convincing as some of the arguements have
been against piracy being a major issue in the Imperium the reality remains
that space is big (real big) and therefore covering all of it is just plain
impossible.  I will agree that the major space lanes are going to be mostly
free from pirates, but get off the beaten track and the risk becomes reality
(so are the likely profits).  Whether this is insystem, away from the
mainworld, or at one of the many other less populated and less
patrolled systems in the Imperium, piracy is a possibility and that is likely
the reason why freighters are allowed to carry weapons.  Its quite clear that
the Imperium is unable or unwilling to provide a threat free environment
in every part of the Imperium.  The fact that the Vargr (TL11 according to
the MT Rebellion Sourcebook data) are still such a threat is indicative of the
Imperium\'s lack of coverage.  If they can still invade major regions of
Imperium space (highest Jump for TL11 is Jump 2) then a pirate with a TL15
ship *should* be able to as well.

If the Imperium really wanted to crack down on piracy they\'d shutdown
shipbuilder that\'s building all the damn Corsairs =).

Personally, I think the best side step is to present it as a new

drive works.  In your heart, you can know its really a J-drive, but it

So you\'d expect that in a few centuries people would begin encroaching on

The atmospheric taint is a microscopic pollen exuded by the local vegetation
which in 243 was discovered to have carciogenic effects. Breathing it for
decades increases the risk of developing cancer significantly. Breathing large
amounts of it caused a clogging of the lungs known as "Green Lung" similar to
the "black lung" experienced by coal miners and asbestos workers on low- and
mid-tech worlds.

What I\'m working on is an adventure involving an archeological expedition
searching for the legendary lost city of Iwea Uduk, The Cool Caverns, a cave
complex in the steaming, fetid jungle south of the Miasmic Sea where a lost
colony have carved out an underground city where the temperature is pleasant
to man. They were an unidentified minor human race who rebelled against
intergration with the Zhodani and fled when defeated. They lived hidden for
several centuries before dying out. The caves were found around 700 by a
prospector who kept their location secret to protect the many artifacts he
found there. He traded away som of the artifacts which is how the news of
the caves gets out. Upon his death the location was once again lost.

(Btw. does anyone know the name of a minor human race assimilated by the
Zhodani? And when it happened?)

These refugees would be TL 11/12, but they would be in hiding from their
Zhodani oppressors (Mind you, I\'m not saying that their fears of being
pursued were realistic; perhaps their leaders used the Zhos as boogymen
to keep their people in lene?).

The biggest problem would be lubricating your gun. Most lubricants (eg.
gun oil) boil off volatiles in vacuum, plus for long-term exposure you
have to worry about things like vacuum welding. An easy way around this
problem is to rule that all weapons used in vacuum require increased
maintenance. If (like me) you just insist that your players schedule
\'maintenance time\' with their characters this won\'t affect your game that
much - their characters will just have less spare time.

Funnily enough I didn\'t.  But when I finished the book on Monday I thought
to look it up in _The Encyclopedia of Fantasy_ [1] I managed to persuade my
wife to buy for a birthday present.  That told me all I could want to know
about Alan Garner and revealed that, as you said, WoB is the first of a
trilogy completed by:

The Moon of Gomrath
Elidor (which ironically I actually happen to have and have never read)

If anyone cares (and says so), I\'ll let you know what I thought of them
after I\'ve read them.  (Visiting a funny old second hand bookshop today, I
lucked out in the children\'s section and found The Moon of Gomrath, having
only gone to look for some Norton books for Dom!)


Anyway, thanks Leonard for the tip.  It was very close to being news to me.

THe whole radiator thing is a big can-o-worms, best hashed out on
TLL - but the quick summary is that
(a) fusion reactors won\'t use steam turbines; Traveller fusion reactors
probably use magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generators, in which the plasma
moving rapidly through a magnetic field generates electricity. For 
various reasons the efficiency of this is very high (one reason is
thermodynamics; efficiency of a heat engine depends on the temperature
difference between the "hot end" and the "cold end", and of course the
hot end of a fusion reactor is at millions of K, much hotter than most
steam engines.
>MHD\'s require superconducting magnets which would be incompatible with the
>temperatures produced by the plasma.
  (a1) superconducting magnets help, but they aren\'t necessary
  (a2) the magnets don\'t have to be at the plasma temperature - the
  magnets are (thermodynamically) part of the cold end of the heat
  engine. It may take effort to keep them cool, but it\'s not impossible.

(b) as far as what happens with the electricity - the big power hogs
on a starship are weapons and thruster plates. T-plates have enough
problems with conservation of energy already that one might as well
assume nearly all the power that goes into them gets turned into
kinetic energy/gravity waves/mysterious blue glow rather than being
waste heat. Weapons are trickier, but high TL lasers get at least 80%
of their input energy onto the target (with 3/4 of that being used
for grav focusing, if you look at the numbers), so they don\'t waste
much heat either. 

Other things do use some power - but one fundamental problem with
Traveller is that they almost all use more power than they should 
(computers using megawatts, etc) so it seems fair to ignore them,
especially since the weapons and T-plates dominate.

Of course, the fundamental reason for the 10% assumption is that 
otherwise large ships become impossible; you run out of surface area.
Try designing a big TL-12 ship with ten times the radiator area 
given in FFS2 - you get into trouble fast. We\'re *already* running
radiators at unrealistically high temperatures, and everyone wants
big ships, so we had to compromise (in a not-completely-ludicrous way,
although the waste heat from refrigeration is inadequately accounted
for.)

Doesn\'t work. The vacuum won\'t absorb the heat. Most of it will end up
trying to heat the portions of the radiating surface that face each
other. 

Your actual *effective* radiator area is the area of the openings at
each end. To radiate *away* the heat, it has to be able to travel in a
*straight* line from the surface of the raidiator to empty sky.

Either way, check the size of the turbine for a 1 MW generator. It
takes up *way* more space than is alloted for power plants, and
realistically, they aren\'t going to get much smaller.

They can have a much smaller radius.

Doesn\'t stop us from having working prototypes *now*. The *magnets*
aren\'t exposed to the plasma. Remember, you can get a strong, fairly
uniform field *between* the poles of a magnet and not lose too much
field strength by widening the gap as long as the "poles" are wider
than the gap. It\'s the electrodes and the ceramic lining of the
"throat" of the generator that have problems.

Adapting to higher heat levels *physically* (rather than
technologically) is rather different from adapting to lower oxygen
levels. The Andean Indians have bigger lungs, and higher hemoglobin
levels (and they pay for this with problems with excessive blood clot
hazard IIRC). 

But for higher heat tolerance, after a bit you are up against the heat
tolerance of *all* the protiens in the body. Reworking those will take
millions of years, not mere generations. Any physical adaptations will
be via increasing the existing cooling mechanisms in the body. And
those do hit fairly hard limits above 50C or so.

Check the temp and humidity next time you visit a sauna. They typically
reach 180F, and often have *high* humidity (at leasst after someone

OK, at *our* TL, you can maintain a temp & humidity *quite* different
from outside without having your exhaust "plume" be readily detectable
via IR sensor looking for temp *or* humidity variances. 

You use something called a "counter-current heat exchanger" and if you
line the air passages in such a device with moisture absorbent
materials, it\'ll maintain the humidity difference as well. 

The basic idea is that the outgoing air is used to cool and dehumidify
the *incoming* air. 

Use geothermal power (with the powerplant in a distant part of the cave
system so you don\'t have to deal with the heat from it) and you\'ve got
a nice, hard to detect site.

Your explorers will likely wear something like the cooling suits that
race car drivers and astronauts use. Basicly a set of long underwear
with a network of fine tubing running through it. The tubing carries
water, which is circulated by a small pump. The astronaust use a
suitcase sized cooling unit while on the way to the pad, and a huge
back-pack in space. The race car drivers just use a belt pack full of
ice. 

One writer for Popular Science tried one out about 30 years back. He
visited a suana while wearing it and except for having to *breath* the
hot, humid air he had no trouble. He tried a steam room also.

Obviously the explorers can\'t carry enough ice, so they\'ll need some
sort of "refrigeration unit" to cool the fluid in the cool suits. Which
is going to make them carry a lot of extra weight.

Well, it gets into consequences.  I peronally think that
capacitors and drop tanks are a problem because they
essentially eliminate the need for fuel and push you more
to a Babylon 5 type of background.  In some cases there is
also the issue of why you can\'t use all that energy for
other purposes.  While I still maintain that a low-efficiency,
high throughput only, reactor would solve that problem.
I think it is better to go an explination that the Lanthanum
grid (anchored in jump space early on) is linked to the reactor
in such a way (energy sink, etc) that allows reactors to run
at higher rates than they could otherwise.

Other explinations that the jump fuel is used for cooling or
as mass to throw into jump space exist.  I don\'t care for them
and will let those that do explain them.

Fundamentally big sensors are expensive and I would want more than
400std for a biillion credits.

So the following design is a bit different.

I felt jump 2 was too much, besides it can cary at least 100 "normal"
lab ship designs.

Finally a plea - could THUDDD be brought back to the TML?

Phil Kitching

=======================

ConCERN-1, Supercollider class, Laboratory Ship
(FF&S v2, the Andrew Atkins Spreadsheet)
Designed by Postmark Design Bureau, Emerging Technologies Division

Design Philosophy

Why more than 1,000std?

The main failing with most laboratory ship designs is the total failure to
define what the ship is intended to do.

The current trend for jump capable lab ships in the sub 1,000std range is
pointlessly expensive without actually giving any capability.

Most scientific missions require world surface contact and emphasise long
duration on station. Under these circumstances, the jump drive is not
required and a non-jump capable boat would be more effective.

If this is required, the Postmark Design Bureau can happliy supply this
need with the Exploration Pod, the prototype of which forms part of the
Pioneer X Exploratory Trader.

Even this is excessive. The research of our scientific economics department
indicates that most teams would find, suitably equipped modules for the
obiquitous modular cutter the most cost effective solution. Capable of easy
redeployment by any available merchant, they can form ground and space
facilities to any requirement.

For more exacting missions, 1,000std is insufficient because it is unable
to carry the largest sensors, the resulting ship being little more use
than a cheap scout ship.

So Why 280TCr?

The ConCERN-1 is built inside a particle accelerator torus 2,500m in
diameter, the diameter of the accelerator tube being 220m. Combined with
the ability to accelerate particles for 100 laps, gives a supercollider
of the first order and defines the size of the vessel.

If the only purpose of this ship was to be a supercollider, then there
would be little point in the manoeuvre and jump drives.
The ConCERN-1 allows the particle beam to be focused and used as a probe
for distant astronomical phenomena.

With care in setup, an energy density of 624TJ/cm2 can be maintained out to
over 2 light hours (16AU). With the ability to repeat the experiment every
other minute if required, there are almost no limits to the discoveries
awaiting the purchaser of ConCERN-1.

This would be of little use if the results cannot be detected. For this
reason, a complete range of the finest sensors available has been fitted.
Note that, even with the great size of the ConCERN-1, these massive arrays
will only fit as folding arrays, demonstrating once more the futility of
smaller vessels. These sensors allow many astrophyical observations to be
carried out.

In addition, a large number of supplmentary sensors have been fitted,
along with probe launchers and laser batteries with which to conduct
surface ablation experiments.

In order to hold all this together, the structure is built to withstand
3G stresses from the operation of the supercollider and it is wrapped
in 1m of superdense.

Besides, if 100 ships are ordered, the cost of the ConCERN series
will be reduced by 56TCr each by quantity discounts, a saving of 5,600TCr.


The needs of the Scientists

The ConCERN-1 is able to fully cater for 4,000 scientists
(1 lab for each team of 4) plus numerous assistants (for a total of 10,000)
and a like number of dignitaries and media.
In addition to full multi-room conferencing throughout the ship, larger
conference and lecture halls are available for the presentation of results
to one\'s piers.

The 100 vessels of up to 1,000std each allow ships such as those from our
competitors to be carried as remote sensing targets for the supercollider.
In addition the 4,000 50std boats can be used to ferry the crew of over
2 million between ship and planetary installations.
These are supplemented by 8,500 lifeboats for use in emergency situations.
Of course many alternative types of craft can be carried depending on
requirements.

I think this is an excellent design, a bit big, but good none the less.
Perhaps expanding the accomodations a bit and adding classrooms you would
have one hell of University.  I could envision one or two per sector as
cutting edge research universities.

All sorts of adventures await on a ship that has a population larger than

Just picked up a bit on this thread, sorry if I rehash any past arguements.

Traveller PPs are definately NOT steam turbines. Most "Modern" steam
turbines (really just improvements on 1950\'s vintage basic designs) run
60-70% efficiency. The 15 MW steam powered units in my facility take up
about the area (turbine and generator) of a 100 sdt scout. The 30 MW frame 5
gas turbine generator train (including a waste heat recovery) is just
slightly larger (including shound baffeling).  Current trends depend much
more on the gas turbine technology for "spot" generation systems (basically
a jet engine hooked to a generator) since the size to efficiency numbers are
far better than anything else available.

Personally I\'ve always concidered Trav Fusion PPs as some magic hand wave
not even thought of yet since nothing in sight looks to have the size to
effciency needed to produce the power that star ships require. Maybe an HPG
will do it by Traveller\'s era, I really don\'t know enough about them to
know, but I do know that modern generation techniques, especially steam
turbine driven equipment, will ever reach effciencies even close to
size/weight to output that Traveller calls for.

If any one knows better let me know since the refinery I work for would be
VERY interested!

  It could be a cultural thing, although we\'re not told enough to decide
for ourselves. OC, if no-one had "weapons", then rigging up a mass-driver
for close-in work would arm you well enough for piracy. Or just deploy
a high thrust launch with some well-aimed bowling balls.

>I mean -- who\'d trust a civilian with a nuke det laser? 
>after all it\'s not just a missile - it\'s a nuke!

  CT ship weapons have to be reassessed in light of the more realistic
technology and rules developed since (or not - it\'s not a world-breaker
if you work it right, I hope). There\'s no way that CT/Mayday contact /
proximity HE/"focussed charge" missiles can work or would exist given
what we know now, and using the rules since enshrined in various design
sequences. So either civilians in a revised CT wouldn\'t have effective
(i.e., mil-equivalent) missiles or the Imperium would have to have changed
its\' attitude about nukes. I suggest the former, as ships can still have
fun with lasers and sand - and pirates can still succeed with them.

  Well, the quotes from SOM include (IIRC - my copy is missing) include
the note that ships on safe runs in the interior often have only a few
sandcasters (and presumably, possibly not even that). If you assume that
most ships are presented for frontier use (SM, SR) then the armaments
become rational, and you just have to settle on how the threat works,
even if regulation and security measures have made piracy quite risky.

In fact, there are one or two at TL 16 in Gvurrdon sector (Hi-pop ones, IIRC).  
At least, there were some pre-Virus.

How many times do you have to roll Ship on the Muster Out Benefits Table
to get this ship.  And how old would you be, I expect the character that
did this would be everso lucky (with aging and compulsory reinlistments)
and have a fairly decent pension if of course they ever retired.

The Orca class raiders were one of the most successful Terran warship designs
during the Interstellar Wars. They were built for the simple purpose of
destroying enemy commerce, a role in which they were extremly effective.
First employed during the 2nd War, the Orcas continued in service until well
after the end of the Interstellar Wars, even though they had become obsolete
by the end of the 7th Interstellar War. During the early Wars the Orca\'s
favoured tactic was to hide either in a gas giant atmosphere or a planetry
hydrosphere, utilising their long endurance, massive structural strength and
radiation sheilding to await targets as they attempted to refuel. When a
target presented itself they would use their excellant acceleration and
maneuverability (due mainly to their airframe hull) to achieve a quick kill
before any response could be launched. Their massive strength (the Orca\'s
were able to withstand up to 55g\'s of stress with no difficulty) then usually
allowed them to dive to extreme depths to escape pursuit. These tactics
proved to so effective that by the 4th War the Vilani had abandoned wartime
wilderness refueling in all but the most extreme circumstances.

The Orca featured a number of unusual design features. The most obvious was
the auxilary 0.3g HEPlaR maneuver drive, this was intended to allow limited
maneuver beyond the effective limitations of thruster plates to enable the
ship to utilise deep space resupply depots. The ship also features a full
large stateroom for each crew member and a fully equiped gym to reduce crew
strain on long deployments. These features along with the ships small cargo
capacity made the class ideal for inserting covert operations teams (by
using double occupancy up to 11 extra individuals could be accommodated for
short durations).

The most famous example of the class was the Røget Sild. Under the command of
leftenant Ulla Atterdag, she was responsible for the destruction of more than
560,000 sdt of Vilani shipping over a five year period during the 3rd War.
Leftenant Atterdag was one of the most charismatic Terran officers during the
War and received a double bar to her Terran Cross, along with many other
decorations. Her disappearance behind Vilani lines in 2152AD still remains
unexplained, despite an extensive search of Vilani records no trace of her
or the Røget Sild was ever found.

My experience has been that a regiment or brigade (4-5000 people plus
dempendent family members) is enough to find just about any skill you could
ask for.  One of my Regimental commanders put out a request for bagpipers,
and got two responses.

***War Story Alert!***  "No sh*t, there I was..."

I used something like this in a campaign - "Slash Fever".  The bug was a
bio-warfare agent, developed to weaken collagen rather than destroy it
outright.  I added an adrenaline-related trigger (originally intended to
tie the effects to combat stresses for maximum impact).  Five days after
exposure, any post-adrenaline reaction would result in huge tears along the
stress points on the skin, combined with massive internal bleeding.  Then I
introduced the thing into a remote colony from a centuries old, abandoned
spaceship....  The characters were chasing shadow "Aliens" through the
bowels of the colony, while the paranoia-induced excitement and fear caused
successive waves of colonists to die, slashed to ribbons.  The doctor
character finally pulled out the correct explanation ("hey, why aren\'t
their clothes slashed as well?") in time to find a solution.

Didn\'t help that one of the early casualties was really a murder victim,
done up to look like a slasher attack.

The Darwin class frigates achieved a permanent place in both Terran and
Vilani history over Barnard\'s Star in 2110AD when the Canberra was involved
in the incident which sparked the 1st Interstellar War. Designed for the
Western League shortly before the outbreak of the War, the Darwin was
commissioned in 2107AD, to be followed by the Canterbury and Canberra in
2108AD and the Melbourne and Port Morsby in 2109AD. The class incorporated
the latest drive, missile and computer technologies; and was built around a
40m 1600Mj spinal particle accelerator along with a sextuple Kea missile
launcher and a 16Mj point defence laser. The class incorporated most of the
features that were to come to distinguish Terran warships throughout the
Interstellar Wars. They were designed to withstand far greater stresses than
they would ever reasonably expect to encounter (the Darwin\'s were rated for
30g\'s of stress); featured a closed loop biologically based life support
system and carried sufficent supplies for lengthy patrols without resupply;
and they were built around a single spinal mount. During the First War no
less than seven more Darwin\'s were commissioned by the Western League and
another four were built for the Prometheus Colonial Command. The Darwins were
extensively employed throughout the War and suffered accordingly, with seven
being lost. With the cessation of hostilities in 2118AD the Darwins were now
obsolete and were quickly reduced to reserve status and gradually scrapped.
However three survived to see action in the 2nd Interstellar War (albeit in
2nd line duties); and another one was lost in this conflict.


With the end of the 2nd War the remaining two ships (the Canberra and the
Otago) were finally decommissioned and scheduled to be scrapped. However a
massive public campaign resulted in the preservation of the Canberra as a
historic monument on Barnard. When Barnard was occupied by the Vilani in
2148AD the Canberra was removed to the Vilani provincial capital at Dingir
where she was to remain until after the 8th Interstellar War. When the Terran
Confederation occupied Dingir in 2267AD plans were made to return the
Canberra to Barnard. Since the resources could not be spared during the War,
her relocation had to wait until 2272AD, when she was finally returned and
formally recommissioned into the Confederation Navy.

Dom, my replies to you are being bounced. Here is what our network people
tell me:

I looked up their MX record, then made sure that the resulting machine
existed, then telnetted to it for SMTP mail. I tried to send a message
with the following result:

% telnet mserv0.u-net.net 25
Trying 194.119.128.80...
Connected to mserv0.u-net.net.
Escape character is \'^]\'.

rcpt to: nobody@cybergoths.u-net.net
550 relaying to <nobody@cybergoths.u-net.net> prohibited by administrator

So, mail0.u-net.net (which really ended me up at mserv1b.u-net.net) thinks
that it needs to relay mail (i.e. it is not where mail for
cybergoths.u-net.net should be delivered), but it is refusing to do so
because it has anti-spam measures in effect.

The problem, then, is the setup AT THE OTHER END. They are configured such
that mail for cybergoths.u-net.net should be delivered to mserv0.u-net.net
but *that* machine (who then calls itself mserv1b.u-net.net) thinks that
it is not the machine to which that mail should be delivered.

I\'ll cc this to the postmaster@mserv1b.u-net.net and see if that gets
through. If it does, this should provide the info they need to fix it.

========== Message 2 ==========

Sorry. Your message could not be delivered to:

	RCPT TO:<postmaster@mserv1b.u-net.net>
	Received: 550 relaying to <postmaster@mserv1b.u-net.net> prohibited by

Looks like their setup is really ...

wouldn\'t work it coudn\'t exist in the Imperium because ships are too

used as an example, "if we opened up the cargo door and threw out the sofa

Excellent ship.  But why no small craft?  I can\'t imagine a commander

they are worth):

SENSORS

I have watched the ongoing debate over piracy and the sensors systems, and I
have to come to the following conclusions:

1)  As the rules are written now (with Bruce Macintosh\'s wonderfully accurate
DSR system) piracy is no longer a viable, believeable option.  (please no
flames!)

2)  As CT was written (1977), the sensor ranges were short enough to allow
piracy to go on w/ a reasonable chance of success.  According to my LBB\'s, a
commercial ship could detect a ship out to a range of 150,000km (.5 light-
second) and a military or scout vessel could do 300,000km (1 light-second),
with a tracking range (once detected) of 900,000km (3 light-seconds).

I have tried ever since MT to try and make all the systems come out w/ the
same or reasonably similar results.  It\'s like trying to fix a kite string by
climbing up the string and reattaching it to the flying kite- it can\'t be
done.  So I have gone back to the basic CT system.

As far as sensors go, I am using the following ideas.  The Basic Ship Design
System for CT says a bridge is 2% of the hull tonnage, with a 20 ton minimum.
This is to represent controls for the ship and sensor systems.  I have 5
different types of sensors:

1) Minimal Civilian.  This is an active-only system with a detect range of
50,000km (roll 9+, subject to DM\'s) and a tracking range of 150,000km

2) Basic Civilian.  This is an active-only system with a detect range of
150,000km (roll 8+, subject to DM\'s) and a tracking range of 300,000km

3) Advanced Civilian.  This is an active/passive system with a detect range of
300,000km (roll 7+ for active detect, 8+ for passive detect, subject to DM\'s)
and a tracking range of 450,000km.

4) Basic Military.  This is an active/passive system with a detect range of
450,000km (roll 7+ for active detection, 8+ for a passive detection, subject
to DM\'s) and a tracking range of 600,000km.

5) Advanced Military.  This is an active/passive system with a detect range of
600,000km (roll 6+ for a active detection, 7+ for a passive detection, subject
to DM\'s) and a tracking range of 900,000km.

I don\'t have the paperwork with me (to give the exact DM\'s) but they are
things like Sensor Ops skill, range (DM -1 if range is greater than half
detect range for sensor), stealth level ( oh yeah, added stealth- no mass
cost, but beaucoup expensive), target using active sensors, etc.

Let me know what y\'all think of this, still tweaking it a bit.  If anyone is
real interested, I\'ll post the list of new things I added to CT ship design to
the list.

Designer\'s Notes:

	FFS2 design, using Andrew "FFS2 Saint" Akins
marvellous spreadsheet (with some modifications.)

	Modular vs non-modular ship is a somewhat complicated
tradeoff, since modular ships add a moderate amount (24 dTons, in 
this case) of waste space and a larger amount of waste weight.
On the other hand, the requirements for a science/lab ship are
pretty broad. An astronomy or survey ship really needs a PEMS-14
(50 million km) sensor - but a lab ship that\'s going to spend most 
of its time in orbit doing twisted biochemical experiments doesn\'t.
Ships on long-duration missions need machine and electronics shops;
ships doing planetary surveys need extra landers; ships invesitgating
stellar anomalies need extra fuel (it\'s hard to field-refuel from
a neutron star.) So, I went with modular. It turned out reasonably
well, since I followed the basic rules of modular ship design (never
streamline the main ship, never put anything (like primary jump fuel)
in the modules you don\'t have to.) Overall it\'s a pretty efficient
ship, given the variety of missions and capabilities it has.
Slightly pricy - though most of that is the sensor suite, and I\'d say
a PEMS-13.5 (5 million km) is pretty much the minimum for any kind
of lab ship - but cost was only a secondary consideration in this
THUDD.

  One design feature I\'m proud of is including seperate workstations 
throughout the ship (in the lab modules and in the bridge) for 
scientists to run things like sensors or other ship equipment (the laser,
the tractor, or even the drive) from. The ship has a full-fledged bridge
rather than the cramped flight deck it could technically get away with
to make interactions between scientists and crew during coordinated 
operations (using the sensor array to study a dangerous object, for example)
easier.

Several other modules will be made available, including the Tenured VIP
module (4 large staterooms, full galley with Excellent meals, recreation
area) and the Press Conference Module (4 offices for reporters plus a 
300 m3 presentation room.) BAMTech cannot comment on rumors that the 
Nominal Agency for Space Astronomy has ordered a Darwin-class equipped only
with VIP quarters and Press Conference Modules.

	I\'ll name a ship in the next construction batch for anyone who
can identify the origins of any nine of the names. BAMTech will
deliver a free labship to anyone who can identify all ten. (For each
name there are several people other than me who can identify them - 
but I think there\'s absolutely no overlap between some of these
groups.) Anyone who can identify BAMTech\'s hidden agenda underlying
the design will get an all-expenses-paid visit from our Special 
Customer Service Group.

I like it.  It has two factors which Traveller has had until the advent of
TNE; it\'s fast and playable.

Each launcher may launch one capsule in 30 s.  A launch facility takes up 1 
displacement ton, costs Cr10,000 and stores 1 capsule.  Additional launch-ready 
storage takes up 0.5 displacement tons and costs Cr1000 per capsule.  
Additional capsules beyond the capacity of the launcher may be carried as 
cargo, at 0.5 tons each.

Capsules:
    2 000Cr  basic
   10 000Cr  assualt (ECM, chaff, armour-20 [6cm steel-equiv], must roll 9+ to 
             fire at capsule +/- TL difference)
   50 000Cr  high-survivability (ECM, chaff, several decoy capsules, armour-28 
             [12cm steel-equiv], can only be fired at by point-defense wpns)

Hex row indicates hexes above and below the equator. Base temperature is
base temperature calculated from stellar luminosity, orbital distance,
albedo, and greenhouse effect. Latitude modifier modifies the base
temperature up or down. Summer plus is temperature increase during
summer; it dosen\'t apply near the equator, so the \'summer plus\' is
multiplied by the axial tilt effect to give the summer plus for that
hex row. Daytime plus is increase during daytime based on length of the
day. Highest temperatures for each hex is found by adding the relevant
columns. Winter and nighttime minus is similarily calculated.

And IMO it\'s a most unlikely pirate vessel because it leaves a broad paper
trail whenever it is "swimming with the other fish", cannot earn money as
a merchant when it is pirating or as a pirate when it is trading, is either
no stronger than its prey or much more expensive, and can have several
year\'s profits wiped out by one lucky shor by an opponent.

The bottom line is that I don\'t think a pirate can earn enough money to
make piracy profitable if he sticks to taking random cargoes, can\'t
catch specific targets, and will have a lot of trouble fencing something
as readily identifiable as a starship.

I didn\'t say it made sense, did I? In fact, I specifically said it DIDN\'T
make sense.

Yeah, right. If no one legally had weapons except the Navy, then only the
Navy and the pirates would have weapons. But that would, of course, make
it a tad tricky for the pirates to pass a customs inspection, now wouldn\'t
it?

>If Piracy is so impossible, then why do most of the canon ship designs have

Because the canon describes an invented universe that dosen\'t have a built
in guarantee that it all makes sense?

>guarantee any vessels safety. 

Nobody claimed that the Empire could guarantee all vessels\' safety. Just
that piracy in the CT universe is not a money-making proposition.
 
>IMO The details can vary so much depending on 
>your assumptions, but the end result has should mesh with that.

It\'s true that the details can vary a lot, but so far I haven\'t seen any
consistent set of details that makes piracy lucrative. The best suggestion
I\'ve seen so far is a bunch of mutineers in a starship too hot to take
into any legitimate port and certainly too hot to sell, and I\'m not at
all convinced that such a ship would be able to survive.

That would be a devastating argument if it wasn\'t for the fact that the
tiny percentage of space that merchants would logically travel through is
small (real small).

Get off the beaten track and the pickings become very slim too.

What it is indicative of is that the MT authors didn\'t bother to reality-
check (or perhaps I should say consistency-check) their Vargr menace (or
their Aslan menace for that matter).

>If they can still invade major regions of Imperium space (highest Jump for

Ignoring the question of whether the statement is true -- whether the
ability of whole Vargr nations to invade portions of the Imperium really
implies that individual corsairs would be succesful -- I challenge their
(admittedly canonical) ability to imvade the Domain of Deneb. Given the
canonical CT information about Vargr social organisation and Domain of
Deneb naval strength, the Vargr would NOT be able to take away several
subsectors of the Domain of Deneb from a man like Norris. 

BTW, when I write \'admittedly canonical\' I mean that I know most, if not
all, of the references to the post-Rebellion Vargr invasions and I do
not claim that they don\'t exist; I clain that they do not make sense.
Consequently merely referring to any single canonical reference about
the Vargr invasions is not sufficient to convince me otherwise.

Heck, if I can put the Sayat entry for THUDDD 8 online, I can damn well
put the Lab Ship of the Gods up, too.  I\'ll hold off until after the
contest to prevent confusion, and to avoid making all the real contestants
look like rowboats with stern-mounted bunsen burners. :)

Thanks for the suggestion, kind sir. Now that I think of it, I\'d probably

business (Starman Adventure Systems) which produced an
Approved-for-Traveller product based on the Duke of Regina\'s 4518 Lift

comprised 3 cloth patches (Regina shoulder flash, Imperial Sunburst patch,

individually-numbered (and thus unique) Military Discharge Certificate
signed by Norris, Duke of Regina (blank so you could fill in your

patches. After selling a couple of hundred sets, the last sets (or what I
thought were the last) were "remaindered" to GDW, who handed them out as
prizes at some conventions. Those of you who have JoTAS #20 (page 3) or 23
(page 23) can see our advert or read about us in the Editorial. These sets
have sold subsequently to collectors for up to $50 US; they are VERY rare!

Actually some Vargr worlds have tech levels as high as TL 16.  This is
established first in CT\'s Vargr Alien module where two Vargr worlds in
Gvurrdon sector are TL 16 according to Second Survey data (AM 3 Vargr pg
47):

0439 	A000000-G	Lo nIn As	220 Va K8 V M7 D
2128	A231355-G	Lo nIn Po	210 Va M9 V

now admitedly these two worlds have a combined population of only about
2,000 Vargr & consequently could build almost nothing but the TL 16
Vargr worlds are out there.  IIRC some MT adventure or supplement
established the existance of at least 1 TL 16, High Pop Industrial Vargr
world (even before they captured the TL 16 Imperial world of Gemid
1903/Vland A 423979-G in 1119).

That reminds of of a nasty idea a friend had once. Here it is, modified
to fit Traveller. This is assuming the old bit where thrusters work
fine in deep space.

Have a ship find a comet or something *way* out in the outer reaches of
the system, best would be at least a light *week* out. A light month
would be better. Refuel from it, and also fill a set of drop tanks.

Next, you determine where your target will be at the appropriate time
and start boosting towards it (using thrusters) at max acceleration. At
the same time, start firing your laser(s) at it. When you reach a fair
fraction of c, and are getting close to the target, dump the tanks,
jump to another system, giving yourself plenty of room to decel.

If you can\'t manage to fire the lasers the whole time, fire them for
the *latter* part of the trip. You want as much as possible of the
laser fire to be done at a high fravtion of c.

From the point of view of the target, your laser beam is shortened to a
brief pulse, and blue-shifted to ranges nobody\'s lasers can reach. :-)

So if the target doesn\'t detect the attacking ship, what the survivors
report will be a burst of energy in the high gammas, trailing down
towards the normal frequencies, and containing a truly unreal energy
density.

Ok, since the daytime + and nightime - seem to be the same, that means
that a thermally buffered surface structure would have an interior
temp that\'s the figure you\'d get *without the night/day modifiers. 

A sufficiently deep habitat would have the temp given by averaging your
highest and lowest temp columns (unless the seasonal swing isd *highly*
asymettrical as in 90 days hot 240 cold or some such. In that case,
figure the temp for each day of the local year, add them all up and
divide by the number of days in a year)

It\'s also possible that if the day/night swing is really asymettrical
(like near the poles), you\'d have to do the same sort of "weighted
average (take the temp every hour, sum them, and divide by number of
hours in a day).

I still think the sub-space heat sink is the way to go. Avoid going into
too much detail and make sure it only works in space and you have a perfect
handwave and can concentrate on quantifying the effects to get the results
we want. You might even say that the existence of something like that is
implied in the (relatively) short CT detection ranges and the various
vague references to stealth technology.

The last time the subject was discussed I was told that such a device
would enable perpetuum mobiles, but when I argued that it would be no
more a perpetuun mobile than a solar panel is and asked just how much
power you could theoretically get out of such a subspace link (always
assuming that the temeprature of subspace weren\'t 4 K rather than 0 K),
I never saw an answer.

   Thought I might add a quote to the discussion-

"In the space lanes linking the Imperial core worlds, Imperial Navy vessels
patrol constantly, protecting trade and commerce. But outside that region, a
ship\'s safety is its own responsibility. Outnumbered and outgunned by pirate
vessels, a lone vessel\'s only real defense is to evade fire long enough to
escape to jump space." (T4- Book 1)
   
   Sounds as though the fleet is either garrisoned somewhere or space really
is so big that placing sufficient patrolling vessels in each system is
impractical. As a result, only the core systems are rich/important/whatever to
justify the necessary fleet. Thus, the need to arm your trade vessel.

a messed up state (ie left them in a puddle!) and I have to try to recover 
damage costs from them. (I sent them Registered Mail, with Insurance of
up to 500 UKPounds!!!!)

What I need is advice from you guys in the know, as to what the selling
on price would be, in a USED condition if they were to come up for sale 
at auction, for example.*
Nb. It would spoil an \'Almost Complete\' collection of TD\'s and MTJ\'s.

The Royal Mail requires *documented proof* as to what the value would 
be, so if any of you guys could e-mail me personally (ie not to the list) 
as to what value you would pay if they turned up for sale, I would be 
extremely grateful. Then I can get my insurance claim dealt with as 
quickly as possible.

How about:

"Space Combat System" (unless it really does cover ground combat too)
"Naval Doctrine"
"Imperial Fleet Action"
"Battle Fleet Traveller"
"Squadron Commander"

IMO yes.
But which would be the effects of it on armor!
I mean could it stay focused with the flow pressure required to breach
armor ( IIRC about
10E+5 bar,  8230 m/sec ), or will the stream disperse quickly because of
the lack
of the exterior atmospheric pressure!
Bernouli says atmospheric pressure has negligiblen effect! ( if I did

Hi:

Sorry to interrupt all this techno discussion with a different sort of
question.

If a character is on a planet recently taken over by Aslan invasion, how
would the Imperium citizens be treated? Would they be eaten, enslaved,
monitored? What would life be like on that planet and the planets in
that system?

They can...up to a point.  They just have to make sure the fins don\'t
face each other.  Of course, you wouldn\'t want great big fins as a
permanate feature on a streamlined ship, so I posted the idea of
extending a long flat radiator ribbon out from the ship at couple of
weeks ago.  Extend it to expose more surface area, pull it in when you
don\'t need to use it.

Of course, now radiator surfaces become interesting targets for
anything that can "scrub" a surface.  Knock out the radiators and the
ship you\'re fighting has to cut power or die.  Knock out enough
radiators and the ship can\'t fight or flee.

Ah, but at least I\'m avoiding the problem of where exactly 
the pirate ship was built... (Which I couldn\'t think of a 
convincing argument for) It also seems that most of your 
other problems are the same for more specialised pirate 
vessels, the only major exception being the "No stronger 
than it\'s prey or more expensive". That\'s why I would tend 
to have a merchant unload a collection of fighters to do 
the fighting, and show up after the mess is dealt with to 
collect the bits. That assumes there is time to deal with 
it, but that\'s life.

Exactly. It would also make it hard for the pirates to 
source weaponry from anywhere inside the Empire. Since that 
doesn\'t happen, I see it as giving some information about 
how the Empire is run.

I would tend to agree, but I\'d start in a different place
than deciding that piracy doesn\'t make sense. I have a
great deal of faith in the inventiveness of criminals (or
perhaps their inability to realistically evaluate
risk/benefit) and I believe that given most sets of
affordable (both in cost and usability of the system)
security measures by the Empire, someone will figure a way
around it. I\'ve done enough security of buildings to
realise that most systems can be got past if you have
enough information, and that information is the key.

In General, neither is bank robbery in the real world. It 
still happens. What I\'m suggesting is that one of the 
reasons the Empire would allow civilians to carry 
ship-to-ship weapons is to fight off pirates, and that 
would only happen if pirates were common enough to be a 
realistic threat.

I don\'t expect it to be lucrative. I expect enough people 
to get away with it that the soap-operas still refer to it 
romantically, and the criminally inclined might believe 
their chances are better than they actually are.
  
And isn\'t part of your argument that if they get away with 
it once that makes it lucrative enough to spend Mcr hunting 
the pirates down? (Apologies if I\'ve mixed your argument up 
with someone elses).

"Allowing that an armed militia is a good way to keep

True, but you\'d need to get seriously close to have much 
chance of hitting with a bowling ball  -  besides, those 
things are expensive.... :-)

I have missed this - why wouldn\'t a Shaped charge contact 
missile work in a vacuum? 1 Atmosphere difference shouldn\'t 
have that much effect on its working, since most if not all 
of the gas and plasma is provided internally to the shaped 
charge. Of course, without the atmosphere to pass on the 
shockwave the wave will be even more directional, but I 
wouldn\'t expect it to spread much in the half meter or so 
for optimal penetration. Proximity explosions are less 
useful perhaps, but some modern Air-to-Air missiles get 
their kills from launching shrapnel (in the classical 
sense) at the target in an explosively propelled cone 
pattern. (Claymores in space anyone?)

Definitely keeping Nukes out of the hands of civies is a 
high priority. (But then, a seriously abused fission 
reactor can cause a pretty mess in the park-bay too).

Simply no room. The design is actually very crampt. Plus the ship doesn\'t 
really need one. I was trying to make a 2nd WW U-boat equivalent. A small 
craft would have been a nice extra, but it would have ment sacrifising 
something more important.

Rob,

I\'ve sent the email to my postmaster... If you need to contact me urgently
it may be better to use the TWG list, as I read that one when I get it,
whereas TML may take a day or so.

One thing I noticed was your postmaster used  "@cybergoths.u-net.net" and
it should be "@cybergoths.u-net.COM" :-/

WRT your website - I have grabbed the language files and Shadows, but the
latter is 1.8Mb in sizes. I may need to Stuff that to put it on my site.
These elements may wait until I get a chance for a major overhaul of my
site.

Will send some Spacebourne stuff this weekend -

It is in progress - the programmer working on it was/is part of the support

otherwise occupied. I\'m afraid it\'s only a Mac thing at the moment.

BTW, has anyone run Infini-V on a G3 Mac?

Maybe it is because they have no standardisation across the various Vargr
states in the extents. None of the components integrate, so the the higher
technology can\'t spread through the Vargr, and lower technologies dominate.

Sure. I think Vargr are *particularly* suited to the "Mad Scientist"
career. After all, isn\'t one of the common lines "Now I\'ll get some

Sounds to me like a Vargr deciding to raise his charisma the hard way.

Not yet, for which you can blaim the G8 conference.

Seriously, my school was selected to represent Canada at eth Young
People\'s Summit (a parallel G8 summit) in Birmingham. Suchir (the student
who was doing the port) was one of the tech team, responsible for setting
up and running an Internet server capable of handling cross-country and
international communication. They succeeded magnificently (the kids, the
official tech support sucked) but had no lives outside the program for a
semester. I\'m hoping Suchir can finish it this summer, before he enters
computer engineering at Waterloo.

Failing that, I am hoping to be able to afford a new G3 computer in August
(one of the iMacs). If I can\'t afford that I\'ll get a used 486 so I can
finish the job.

Atmospheric pressure is irrelevent to the function of a shaped charge
warhead. The jet is focussed so quickly and for so short a time that
the presence or absence of an atmosphere does not matter.

Your question inspired me to rough out the nobles of Norris\' Duchy. I\'ll

1 = Norris Aella Aledon
8 = Marc hault-Oberlindes

Note 1: I\'m sure I\'ve seen an adventure where another Reginan noble was named,
but I can\'t recall the reference. I _think_ it was one of the last issues of
_Challenge_.

Note 2: There may be more nobles than those listed above. Possibly quite a
few more. Possibly a LOT more. _Megatraveller Journal #3_ mentions an
Imperial navy officer who was created Baroness of Delcambre late in the
5FW. Presumably this represent the kind of noble patents the Character
Generation Tables hands out. IMTU such patents are knighthoods equivalent to
local planetary nobility rather than Imperial nobles, but the OTU don\'t have
that distinction.

As for the rest of the SM, there is definitely a Duke of Rhylanor and a
Duchess of Mora. I\'d expect dukes of Trin, Glisten, and Strouden too. IMO
there is no Duke of Aramis nor of Five Sisters and I haven\'t made up my
mind about Lanth yet.

Either that or the bit you quote does not fit the logical ramifications of

 This depends on several things: the two populations and how they compare to
available resources, the amounts of force and bad will generated by the
arrival and "takeover" of the Aslan, and the pre-existing racial attitudes
based
either on long-term beliefs or just last week\'s news.

 If the world has plenty of room and knows it, the Aslan of the Aorlahkt
(we\'re
talking Rebellion-era, right?) would likely just immigrate enmass, shifting
the
local cultural balance.
 If the world either has no room or doesn\'t want anyone using what room
exists,
then they are likely to resist. What happens next will depend strongly on
the number of "cooler heads" both sides possess. The Aslan are interested in
Land, but most of them aren\'t interested in genocide to get it.
 If the Aslan move in and the only way for them to secure their land is to
keep the humans under close watch, then it may be attempted. Relative tech
levels and industrial/economic power will determine their success. Enslavement
or being used as a food animal are both highly unlikely; the Aslan don\'t think
that way...

It really depends on what you mean by \'taken over\' Ihatei fleets are in search
not only of land, but markets for what their land will produce, so they\'ll try
to stay in good relations with their local markets. I see them acting like
many tightly knit migrant groups in the US. They start off poor, stick
together, help each other get started, etc. There will be friction, but it\'ll
likely be economically motivated rather than anything else. (witness the
friction between Vietnamese and Anglo fisherman in coastal Texas during the
early 80\'s for instance)

If some clan from the Heirate takes over they\'ll likely just supplant the
imperial functions: ie: you\'ll pay taxes to the clan not the Imperium. There
may be forced resettlements, but that, too, is unlikely, since the clan will
probably _not_ want to get into a long drawn out guerilla war...that gets in
the way of claiming land (males) or running the business (females).

Planets that gain an Aslan majority will start to become much more Aslan-like
in culture, to the point of humans being assimilated. (There are human
colonies that have been part of the Hierate so long that they have their own
clans and are very Aslan in behavior if not genetics.)

There is a Marquis of Aramis on Aramis (source: The Traveller Adventure).

    'body' => 'Continueing my idea about making average ships sneaky at higher
tech levels:

If a chameleon skin can absorb or at least disrupt radar *and*

Said chameleon skin can make itself dark enough so a skywatch
automated telescope won\'t find it right away *and*

Neutrino sensors are only good at short ranges *then*

**The only thing that makes a starship easy to see at long ranges
when it\'s trying to be sneaky is it\'s heat signature.

Someone asked, "Why not make a tube shaped starship, radiate the
heat into the middle and fly away, leaving the heat behind?"

A cartoon physics idea, but it got me wondering...then Hans mentioned
an idea for a subspace heat sink to solve the radiator problem. Then 
I thought of something else on a starship that\'s often used as an energy
sink in combat: the Jump Drive Capacitors.

Usually, the Jump Drive Capacitors are filled very quickly from the Jump
Drives, burning fuel at phenomenal speed in a particular way. A Black
Globe can dump power into them from battle damage, energy that must
eventually be vented away somehow. Why couldn\'t other devices on the
ship dump power to the Jump Drive Capacitors as well?

For example: A ship wants to run silent in a star system. The Engineer
is in the drive room just before jump exit, his hand hovering over a
power-down switch. The moment the Navigator tells him they are clear
of the jump field, he cuts the power plant to a minimum output - barely
enough to keep the fusion initiator hot. The Pilot tunes the Chameleon
Hull to a nice black of interstellar space, with radar absorbance and/or
disruption on. All the waste heat from life support, engineering, even that
taken in by the hull trickles slowly into the Jump Drive Capacitors. The
exterior of the ship is dark, radar-invisible, radio-silent and _cold_. 
Slowly, the Jump Drive Capacitors fill up with energy - random energy,
about as useful to the jump drives as random assortments of 1\'s and 0\'s
are to a computer. Does it take days, or weeks for the capacitors to fill?
Perhaps even months? The ship, meanwhile, is nearly invisible to long
range sensors. Detection ranges, at least for adventurer-size ships like
Traders and Corsairs, drops astronomically.

Eventually the Capacitors must discharge - too long, and degeneration
of the Zuchai Crystals will begin. A jump with a cracked crystal can be
deadly, of course. Do we discharge by warming up the jump drives and 
making a sub-entry field, one that hasn\'t the fuel to open the bubble?
The ship would spend no fuel, go nowhere, but would probably radiate
like crazy for a while. And woe to the ship caught with Capacitors full
of "junk" energy - she\'ll have to clear the array, and the Engineer will
want full system checks before she\'ll jump safely. Will the jump drive
work properly if it must create a sub-entry field, then do a proper jump
sequence with the Capacitors filling in seconds? Imagine if the 
Capacitors hadn\'t fully discharged when the jump fuel starts burning - 
the explosion as the array overloads might be interesting to watch
from afar.

To make this work, Zuchai Crystals must be able to hold a charge for
a relatively long period of time. Perhaps a low level of charge (the "junk
energy" converted from hull heat and waste heat) will fill the array at
a certain energy level, and at this energy level the Crystals will be
relatively stable. A jump, on the other hand, requires the Crystals to be
clear of energy so they can be taken to a particular, high, unstable energy
level - if they aren\'t clear, the energy level will be too high and the state
of the Crystals will be too unstable to be useful, or safe.

This leads to the idea that it\'s dangerous to hold a low charge in these
things all the time. Jump Capacitors are designed to be used for minutes
every month (Jump Initiation), not days or weeks. Keeping a lower "junk"
charge in them won\'t strain them much - nowhere near as much, for
example, as trying to hold a full jump initiation\'s worth of energy in them.
It will still strain them over an extended period of time.

Hmmm...maybe this would also apply to derelict starships. The ship is
sitting there getting differentially radiated, the heat eventually moving this
way and that throughout the hull materials. If the Zuchai Crystals in the
derelict are energy sinks, maybe they\'d fill up to a certain low level of
"junk" energy, and have to be cleared before use - or increase the chance
of misjump, as holding that tiny charge for years (centuries?) will
eventually strain the Crystals.

  You mean you don\'t have the "Secret Language: Pirates" skill? :)
Actually, I suggested this as a possible source of ship thefts (and
thus _potential_ pirate encounters for the wandering monster charts)
back in November or so. I\'m afraid that I haven\'t expanded much on it
since, although it\'s still on my list of things to do.

  The warhead can be frozen jello given the approach velocities in all but
a stern chase; KE is a more than adequate contact kill mechanism. My point
is that the problem isn\'t the warhead, but getting to under several thousands
of kilometers range, when even a small AT or squad support laser hooked up to
decent sensors will merrily gut the missile, let alone normal CT starship
turret lasers.

  True. Of course even a Seeker with empty bays can simulate a fusion
bomb attack by simply dropping like a (nickel-iron?) rock - thus the
belief in some quarters that traffic control on all but true backwaters
will be quite significant.

  Reviving the hypothetical "pirate of opportunity", you take a merchant
(note: I didn\'t specify "honest merchant") with a tramp/free trader on the
periphery, who only commits an act of piracy if presented with an excellent
opportunity and otherwise conducts a career as a conventional freighter / 
trader business.

  This creates a sizable pool of potential "pirates" who will never have
committed an act of piracy, and may never attempt to do so. Ideally, the
merchant has some experience with basic criminal activities (smuggling, 
mostly) and contacts derived therefrom, as this helps greatly with the
disposal of the newly acquired assets (see below).

  Only the last really matters to a opportunistic pirate who has succeeded
in capturing a victim. If realizing a profit from such a starship (potentially
a year or two after the actual seizure) can\'t be achieved through organized
crime (not necessarily a pirate "band") then the capital and infrastructure
for most of the other forms of piracy probably don\'t exist - which is a thesis

  I agree, with the proviso that at least systematic piracy (which is
what many people seem to expect) doesn\'t seem to be practical under most
circumstances.

Meson Guns shouldn\'t have any sort of "signature" along the path. And
the detonation should look like any other sort of "high energy"
explosion. Up to and including a mushroom cloud if the blast breaks out
into open air.

Particle beams should be severely attenuated by the atmosphere, though
I suspect that the rules ignore or at least minimize this. In any case,
there will be *severe* ionization along the beam path. Think of it as
looking like a *bar* of lightning extending in a straight line from the
target to the edge of the atmosphere.

Yes, *straight*. Unless the planet has a truly *awesome* magnetic
field, it won\'t have a noticeable affect on the beam. By "awesome" I
mean something where magnetic field effects *dominate* movement on the
surface.

There may be some x-ray/gamma ray emmissions during the attack. But
neither beam involves the sort of thing that would induce radioactivity
in otherwise stable elements.

The problem isn\'t that the warheads don\'t work. It\'s that it\'s
effectively impossible to get them *close* enough. 

There are too reasons for this. First, point defense has a *major*
advantage, being able to nail most missiles *way* outside effective
range. 

Second, it\'s very, *very* hard to get a missile to impact or nearly
impact on a ship.

We did toss around an idea for a "nuclear clatmore" based on a design
posted on rec.arts.sf.science. Basicly you surround a nuclear warhead
with something that absorbs the X-rays from the bomb *very* well, and
converts to *very* energetic vapor. One good candidate is *styrofoam*! 

When the bomb goes off the styrofoam absorbs the energy and cobnverts
to vaopr, and that providers the mechanical energy to propel a whole
shitload of BBs to near C speeds. :-)

But even this has a low hit probability if detonated at a rang where
point defense won\'t have fried it yet.

I don\'t quite get the physics, but it sounds like they\'re pumping millions
of degrees into a laser and just firing it off to get rid of it.

Here are some questions about using this design.

It might have a minumum temperature to activate, which might make it
difficult to implement on a ship.

It must be fired somewhere.  3 years later they know what you\'re doing a
parsec away.

It probably needs superconductors to pump all the energy away from the hull.

I don\'t know how detectable it would be off-beam.

But if it works, then you could effectively mask your heat signature in a
way that would make it difficult to detect you except by occultation.

Any comments?

I think the problem is getting heat into a higher energy wavelength.  If you can
figure out how to get it into the light range, then you could probably get it
into a higher range.  I think there\'s also a conservation of energy problem
involved as well.

What you could do is soak up all the heat, then dump it into the liquid hydrogen
just before injecting it into the HEPlaR thrusters. Of course, there\'d still  be
a noticable heat trail from the thrusters.

I do not know wheather this is a doable scenario, but in Brin\'s _Sundiver_,
he had the excess heat used to power a laser that dispensed the energy.  Is
this tecno fantasy, or is it possible?

There were two articles about particle accelerators published in old issues
of JTAS.  Issue 13 had "Charged Particle Accelerator Weapons" by Dave Emigh
(who was consulted about these weapons for High Guard) and "Spinal Mounts
Revisited" by Jim Cumber in issue 20.

The article by Dave Emigh is more about the technical side of how C-PAWS
work, and a little bit about the Meson gun.

The article by Jim Cumber talks about the C-PAWS weapon and how for the
most part it is an atmosphere use weapon only, and the N-PAWS, which is
strictly a space based weapon system.
The way he explained it, the C-PAWS (or Charged-Particle Accelerator Weapon
System) uses charged particles which stay together in an atmosphere,
"because atmospheric pressure acts to keep the beam of mutually repelling
vharged particles together."  "In the vacuum of space...the particles fan
out as soon as they leave the muzzle of the weapon..."
The N-PAWS (or Neutral-Particle Accelerator Weapon System) uses a stream of
high speed chargeless neutrons.  This makes it ideal for space, but "the
neutron beam of the N-PAWS is absorbed and limited by the atmosphere (but
is ideal in space)."
He then goes on to talk about some of the developments of the early 80\'s
byt both the Soviet and the U.S. developers, and theoretical problems the
N-PAWS would have when targeting nuclear weapons.  Briefly, instead of
exploding and blowing away most of the sub critical mass (his example was a
57 kg. Titan I C-4 missile, that he says only 4.66 GRAMS of which is
converted to energy).  According to the theory the N-PAWS would cause an
implosion of the subcrit mass, thus a normal yield 5 kiloton warhead could
produce an explosion in excess of 165 megatons.
     Another thing he brings up is an explanation of the A-PAWS
(Anti-Matter-Particle Accelerator Weapon System) and its associated High
Guard stats.  The editors note at the front of the article cautioned
restraint on the part of referees who wished to use this weapon, as it
might unbalance game play.

Oh well, I\'ve rambled on enough and its getting quite late.

So can you write up the "Mad Scientist" career for Vargr, maybe by
taking the scientist career and adding lots of bells and whistles [dog
whistles of course].  Naturally I would suggest using Pinky and the
Brain, Dr Frankenstein and Igor as seen in Mel Brook\'s Young
Frankenstein or _any_ scientist from 1889 as role models for these
charecters.

What are we going to do tonight?  The same thing we do every night -
plot to take over the galaxy.

Those of you interested in an alternate tech Traveller universe could
rule that Vargr "Mad Scientists" are actually like Tinker Gnomes in AD&D
or Magi in the World of Darkness and they can make things happen simply
because they _believe_ that they will happen.

How about a variant Traveller universe background in which jump space
only works because people believe that it will work and in which the
Vilani got their jump drive from Vargr "Ancient Astronauts".

If you could come up with a convincing scheme for making piracy profitable
as a business venture, I\'d be inclined to take the where is it built
question on faith. I firmly believe that if it is profitable, someone will
find a way to do it, no matter how illegal. It dosen\'t even have to be
consistently profitable. All it has to do is show a profit on the average.

Fighters cost money. And remember, we\'re talking CT rules. That means that
a merchant with even a Model 1 computer is at an advantage over a fighter.
Unless the fighter has a superior computer. And if I was a pirate and
could afford a high-factor computer, I\'d install it in my ship. That\'s
what I was primarily referring to when I said that an effective pirate
would cost more money. That and the maneuver drive. A pirate needs a
maneuver drive that\'s faster than 1G, otherwise he will find it difficult
to chase down any prey. But a faster maneuver drive costs more money and
required a larger power plant, which costs yet more money. It also reduces
cargo space, making the pirate unable to make a living running normal
freight and also unable to pass an onboard inspection without arousing
suspicion. Oh, and a "merchant" carrying fighters will have even less
cargo space and appear even more suspicious.

I didn\'t start by deciding that. I ended up concluding it. I _like_ pirates.
Back when I ran a naval campaign in Five Sisters and District 268 I had the
players going up against several pirate gangs. I just happen to believe
that in order to use pirates I have to ignore several logical ramifications
of the CT background. If you could show me differently I\'d be thrilled.

And I believe that if the purpose is to prevent pirates from stealing ships,
the funds available is enough to pay for effective prevention while if the
purpose is to prevent the pirates from capturing random cargoes then the
pirates can\'t steal enough to pay their expenses. And finally that pirates
can\'t target specific ships with extra valuable cargoes.

Sure, if you want to disrupt merchant shipping, you can do it. But can you
make a living at the same time?

Yes, but a handgun dosen\'t cost tens of millions of dollars and the
ammunition dosen\'t cost hundreds of thousand dollars. Nor are you
required to use use a personally-owned gold-plated Cadillac for a
get-away car. Basically I think that if you need to invest millions
in order to attempt a crime, most of the amateurs is sort of barred
from the start.

This keeps comming up. Somehow people seems to think that the canonical
existense of armed merchants _prove_ that pirates are common in the CT
universe. So it does. Not that you need to prove that pirates are common
in the CT universe, because there is plenty of other evidence, from the
starship encounter tables to the TAS Newsbriefs, to show that they are.
But what is does NOT prove is that said pirates make economic sense.
Yes, if pirates are common, then it makes sense for merchant ships to be
armed. But does it make sense for pirates to be common if merchant ships
are armed?

Sure. The ordinary criminal dope. But how many multimillionaire criminal
dopes do you believe there would be?

>And isn\'t part of your argument that if they get away with it once that
>makes it lucrative enough to spend Mcr hunting the pirates down?
>(Apologies if I\'ve mixed your argument up with someone elses).

Well, that\'s one of the arguments I\'ve used. But you see, the problem is
that I believe that it\'s not any single factor that makes piracy
unprofitable, it\'s a combination of factors. And many of them are undefined. 
So we get discussions about whether a pirate would take the whole ship
with him or just stick to cargoes. But those factors are interrelated.
And they all boil down to economics. IF a pirate can take the ship with him
AND is able to sell it for something not TOO far below its true value, THEN
piracy is a profitable enterprise. BUT, if pirates can take the whole ship,
then preventing the loss of even one ship a year will justify a lot of
security measures that would not otherwise be reasonable. Preventing the
losses that the canonical crop of pirates would inflict would pay for even
more. A lot more. And I believe that those security measures would make it
difficult for a pirate to capture a ship in the first place and to sell a
captured ship for anything close to the true value in the second place.

Perhaps I should reformulate my thesis: Yes, if piracy is really uncommon,
the security measures would eventually sink to a point where an occasional
pirate attack would occur. But the equilibrium would lie a lot lower than
the amount of piracy portrayed in CT sourses.

Even Brin admits that it wouldn\'t really work. He needed a "magic"
device to get rid of heat so he wrote something that sounded good.

The problem is that heat is *high* entropy, and laser beams are *low*
entropy. You can\'t get there from here.

I\'d say (from the top of my head) that HEAT would work in vacuum but self

Leonard Bolden-Tukera, Marquis of Aramis (system) and Baron of Lewis.

Sort of. I work out the minimum social rank (according to my own variant
system that has the Imperial nobility running from 24 to 33) of the ruler
of the planet (based on population, method of selection, and TL). If that
is 24 or more (not the case with any in the Duchy of Regina, btw.) and
the rulership is hereditary, that ruler gets an Imperial title. If he
is elected, selected, or appointed, the planet gets an Imperial noble
with at least that social rank (propably more). After that I use the same
numbers to decide how desirable each planet is to work out a suitable
feudal structure with a few counts per duke, a few marquesses per count,
and a few barons per marquis. I made Jewell a county not so much because
of the population as because there are only enough planets for four nobles.
The reason I don\'t think there is a Duke of Aramis (subsector) is partly
that even Junidy is a tad weak for a ducal planet, but mostly because we
are told that the Marquis of Aramis is a vassal of the Count of Celepina
who is in turn a vassal of the Duke of Rhylanor. That suggests to me
that there are no Duke of Aramis for the Marquis to be under. (And that\'s
also why I put Paya and Dhian under the Count of Rethe). The reason why I
don\'t think Five Sisters has a duke is that it is under naval administration.
The reason why I haven\'t made up my mind about Lanth is that I haven\'t
looked at it yet (in this context).

Said merchant is certainly possible, but he is not generally the one that
shows up in the starship encounter tables, nor is he generally one of those
pirates that buy Corsairs, nor one of those pirates we have seen in various
Traveller adventures.

Also, he has a computer no better than his prey, his maneuver drive is 1G,
his armament is the same as his potential prey\'s, and he leaves a broad
paper trail wherever he goes.

Bruces ideas about pointing your heat dump panels away from your target
sounds vaguely similar to this. My main problem with Brins lasers is that
they are known to break with thermodynamics. Why not stick with our rather
hot radiators (2000 K) plates with Gallium as coolants?

Design Notes:
The River of Gold is based on the Gold of Zurrian. It is created using
FF&S2. The original design of the Gold of Zurrian is presented in "The
Early Adventures" copyright by DGP. The River of Gold carries more
middle passengers and cargo than the original Gold of Zurrian. It costs
about 61 MCr more than the original, also.

The ContraGrav Lifters can be used when the laser turrets are not
operating. They allow the River of Gold to land on high gravity worlds.
The fuel scoops allow refueling at gas giants and the fuel purification
plant allows for the use of unrefined fuels.

There is a crew galley and two passenger\'s lounges. Each lounge comes
with it\'s own galley. One lounge is for high passengers and the other is
for middle passengers. High passengers have a large stateroom, as does
the Captain. Middle passengers have a small stateroom, as do the pilot
and navigator. The rest of the crew live in bunk rooms each having four
to five bunks.

There are sufficient life boats to evacuate all passengers and crew
members. The life boats each seat six and have provisions to last for 4
weeks. They include a fresher.

This is hard to make work with lasers as we understand them; it\'s hard to 
drive a laser with heat (thermodynamically impossible, I think) rather than
a controlled input source (light of a certain wavelength, selected chemical
reactions etc.) It\'s also very inefficient, I think. 

Thermal masking in FFS2 does something slightly similar, though, in that
a ship with thermal masking runs its radiators hotter than a normal ship
(or has more radiator area available) and has the radiators baffled so that
each radiator only emits in a narrow cone; in combat, you shut down 
radiators you think are facing towards the enemy. It suffers somewhat in that
nothing (not even a laser) has a perfect cone - there\'s always some light 
spreading out in sidelobes. basic thermal masking has about 1% of all waste
heat leaking out the sides of cones where it can be seen; advanced has 0.1%;
extreme has 0.01%. So some of these ideas are present in FFS2 - and they
do help, but not infinitely.

>Said chameleon skin can make itself dark enough so a skywatch
>automated telescope won\'t find it right away *and*
This has to be pretty dark. Normal chameleon skins in FFS2 are 99% black 
from the UV to near-IR. Military black is 99.9% black and military ultrablack
is 99.99% black.

I should note that (I think I mentioned earlier) a MilBlack AdvancedMasking
ship actually can do a good job of hiding from the sort of sensor array a
backwater world or small warship would have, at least out at a few million
km...

>What you could do is soak up all the heat, then dump it into the liquid hydrogen

This is hard to make work thermodynamically, because so little hydrogen
gets used up in HEPlaR that you have to heat it to millions of kelvin; that
means more heat gets used up in refrigeration, you have to shuffle
million-kelvin plasma around the ship and/or have a refrigerator that works 
at these temperatures, and you lose efficiency from your main fusion power
plant since the temperature gap between its hot end and cold sink is small.
(I\'ve never actually done the numbers, though, and would be interested to
see what temperature a ton of hydrogen has to reach to contain a megawatt-
hour of energy.)

Generally speaking, this violates the second law of thermodynamics.  Up to a
certain point you can pump away power by spending power, though (basically, if
the outside temperature is (Y) and you want an internal temperature of (X), and
(Y) is greater than (X), you need (Y/X)-1 MW of power to dump 1 MW worth of
heat.  Of course, if your power plant generates heat you have a problem..).

Well, MG physics are broken (half-life doesn\'t work that way) but the signature
would be the same as it is in space, which is to say nonexistent.
A PAW would look like a lightning bolt -- it would start out (mostly) straight,
but if the discharge lasted any significant amount of time it would tend to
kink like a lightning bolt.

Relativistic mesons have enough kinetic energy that when they decay secondary
particles may have enough energy to blow apart nuclei.  Figure induced
radiation comparable to a conventional nuclear weapon of comparable yield.
A PAW at an energy level appropriate for use in an atmosphere (relatively high
beam current) probably doesn\'t have enough per-particle energy to create _any_
secondary radiation, and primary radiation effects are mostly overwhelmed by
direct damage effects.  As such, the radiation effects can be pretty much
ignored.

Los Alamos mail-order supercomputer among world\'s fastest

LOS ALAMOS, N.M., June 18, 1998 - A supercomputer built from ordinary
personal computer components is among the 500 fastest computers in the
world, an international survey reported today.

The Avalon computer cost just $150,000 to build, and can compute more than
20 billion mathematical operations in a second, said Michael Warren of Los
Alamos National Laboratory\'s Theoretical Astrophysics Group.

Avalon made the 315th spot on the 11th TOP500 list released at the
Supercomputer \'98 conference in Mannheim, Germany. The list is the
best-known ranking of supercomputer performance.

"It\'s now possible for a small group of motivated people to design and
build their own parallel supercomputer using off-the-shelf computer parts
and easily available software," Warren said. "Only a handful of companies
in the world produce a computer this fast, and the least expensive costs
well over a million dollars."

Avalon is built out of 68 high-end personal computers that use the Digital
Equipment Corporation Alpha microprocessor, connected by 3Com network
switches similar to those found in a university department or small
business. Each processor in the Los Alamos supercomputer is an ordinary PC,
using the same type of memory and disk drives found in a computer on an
office desktop.

"Each of these processors theoretically is capable of performing over one
billion operations a second, and we bought them at consumer prices," said
Warren.

But hardware is only half of the equation. Software is the hardest part of
getting many processors to work together on the same problem. The Los
Alamos team used an open source Linux operating system and other software
available on the Internet.

"The key to the success of these machines lies in their software, and the
most important part of that software is the Linux operating system," Warren
explained. "Linux can be obtained at no cost through the Internet, but that
is minor compared to its other advantages. In my experience, the
reliability and performance of Linux has no peer.

"We have stressed Linux well beyond where one would expect it to fail, and
it has performed admirably. Because it was developed as open source
software, we can go to the source code and fix many problems immediately,"
Warren continued. "If we can\'t fix it ourselves, we can tap the huge pool
of Linux expertise on the Internet."

While some question the reliability, complexity and difficulty of
installing software on a "do-it-yourself" supercomputer, Warren and his
team had no problems.

"We got most of the parts for Avalon on Friday, April 10. Three days later,
the machine was computing at over 10 billion operations per second." he said.

By Wednesday, which was the deadline for TOP500 list entries, Avalon had
achieved 19.2 billion floating point operations per second. The computer
hasn\'t suffered a single hardware failure or operating system crash on any
of the 68 processors during the last six weeks.

Working with Warren to build Avalon were David Neal, systems administrator
for Los Alamos\' Center for Nonlinear Studies, and David Moulton and Aric
Hagberg, both from the Mathematical Modeling and Analysis Group.

In its short life, Avalon already has performed some significant scientific
computations.

One of the first simulations followed the evolution of a shock wave through
60 million atoms. The simulation ran for more than 300 hours on Avalon,
calculating about 10 billion floating point operations per second.

Physicist Peter Lomdahl, who won the Gordon Bell prize for significant
achievement in parallel processing using the Connection Machine 5
supercomputer at Los Alamos said the Avalon system was extremely easy to use.

"We ported our molecular dynamics code over in about a day and have been
able to perform state-of-the-art simulations of shock-waves in metals that
ordinarily would have required the Lab\'s large-scale shared-memory parallel
systems" Lomdahl said. "Not only does the Avalon system run slightly faster
than a similarly sized commercial system, it does it at a tenth of the
cost, and is much easier to use."  Warren will use the machine in his
computational astrophysics research, performing simulations of galaxies. 

"I am interested in simulating the evolution of the universe from its very
early stages up to the present day," Warren said. "We can test different
ideas about the way the universe is put together by comparing the galaxies
simulated inside the computer with real observations made by the latest
generation of telescopes. Avalon puts the computational power we need to do
those simulations inside our own building, at a price we can afford."

In its "spare time," Avalon helped crack the Certicom Elliptic Curve
Cryptosystem challenge, winning a $4,000 prize that was donated to the Free
Software Foundation. The Foundation led the development of many of the
software tools Avalon uses.

The code-breaking calculations ran at the same time as other large
simulations, but only made progress when the computer didn\'t have anything
else to do.

Initial funds to buy and build Avalon came from the Center for Nonlinear
Studies. Other funding came from the Laboratory Directed Research and
Development program and the Theoretical Division. Shi-yi Chen, deputy
leader of the Center for Nonlinear Studies, said "Avalon will be used for
fundamental researches in nonlinear sciences for a variety of areas,
including applied mathematics, material sciences, complex systems and
climate modeling."

Warren has used parallel computers throughout his career, including several
which have held records as world\'s fastest at the time. In 1996, he built
his first off-the shelf computer, Loki, which last year won the Gordon Bell
prize in the "price to performance" category.

"Loki proved itself as the most cost-effective way to perform large-scale
scientific simulations last year, and now Avalon provides ten times that
performance for only three times the price," Warren said.

Computers using off-the-shelf technology like Loki and Avalon are called
"Beowulf" computers, after the project begun by Thomas Sterling at the NASA
Goddard Space Flight Center. 

"Avalon is a dramatic demonstration of the long-term potential of the
Beowulf model for scalable, high-end computing to perform real-world
applications in science and engineering at unprecedented price-to-
performance ratios," Sterling said. "Since 1994 when the earliest Beowulf
systems were developed at

NASA, a rapidly growing community world-wide has emerged to apply the
Beowulf approach to a broad range of important problems.

"Avalon represents a new generation of Beowulf systems -- breaking new
ground in performance and extending their utility to new and important
areas," Sterling said.

Warren thinks that Avalon\'s success is only the beginning.

"In the future, I imagine hundreds or thousands of machines of this type,
working on important science, engineering and business problems," he said.
"You will probably never hear about those computers, because they are
simply a tool; the problems that they solve and the progress they enable is
the important news."

Patched PCs Zip Up Speed Prize
LANL\'s Homemade Computer in Top 500 
By John Fleck, Journal Staff Writer
                         
Bigger is not necessarily better. 

A group of Los Alamos National scientists who built their ownsupercomputer
by wiring together 70 desktop computers broke into the big time Thursday
when their machine was named one of the 500 fastest in the world.  The
tinkering physicists did it for just $150,000 of lab money -- a fraction of
the cost of the multimillion-dollar commercial machines that dominate the
field. 

Their machine, called Avalon, showed up as the 315th-fastest supercomputer
in the world in the latest Top 500 list released Thursday at a scientific
meeting in Germany.  The scientists weren\'t trying to win honors, said
Michael Warren, the machine\'s designer.  He wanted to simulate the
evolution of the universe, then compare the results to telescope
observations. But he didn\'t have the budget to buy a big computer to do the
work.  "We just needed a tool to get our research done," he said Thursday. 

"Muscling into the Top 500 with the commercial big boys of supercomputing
is a breakthrough for home-built machines," said Thomas Sterling, a
California Institute of Technology scientist who is a pioneer in the field.
 "These are now among the very high end of systems," Sterling said. 
 
The closely watched Top 500 list, produced every six months by computer
scientists in Tennessee and Germany, is to high-performance computing what
the Billboard 200 is to the music industry.
 
For the third time in a row, another New Mexico machine tops the list, a
$46 million supercomputer built by Sandia National Laboratories and Intel.
An IBM computer at the University of New Mexico\'s Maui High Performance
Computing Center also made the list at No. 50, and a collection of
identical new Cray Research machines at Los Alamos occupied spots 97
through 110.                          

Warren and his colleagues started thinking about the design for their
homemade machine in February, sent out a request for bidders to supply the
hardware in March, and had the machine built and running by April. Once the
hardware arrived, it took them only a weekend to put it together, Warren
said. 

"The resulting machine has been a remarkable performer," said Peter
Lomdahl, a Los Alamos scientist who\'s used it to simulate the interactions
of millions of individual atoms.  "We\'re doing simulations here we couldn\'t
do on anything else," Lomdahl said.  Lomdahl stated that for some types of
work, Avalon is more reliable than its larger, faster Los Alamos cousin,
the $110 million collection of supercomputers built by famed manufacturer
Cray Research for the nuclear weapons laboratory. 

Warren\'s group eschewed the big-name supercomputer-makers in favor of a
design based on stacks of ordinary desktop computers.  The idea is that if
you can divide a problem up into pieces and let a bunch of small computers
work together, they can perform as well as a larger, faster machine.  It\'s
an idea that has been used for a long time in supercomputer manufacture,
but Warren and a group of other researchers around the country are pushing
the idea to the limit by doing it with stacks of cheap desktop machines. 

Warren\'s machine uses 70 computers built around a computer chip made by
Digital Equipment Corp. for high-end desktop computers, wired together with
the same type of network hardware used in a typical small business.
Instead of using expensive software to run it like that made by Microsoft,
the scientists use a system called Linux, which has been developed by a
group of volunteer programmers around the world and is distributed free of
cost. Linux is better than commercial software, Lomdahl explained, because
the scientists can get under its hood and tinker with its operations to
fine-tune it to meet their needs, something you generally can\'t do with
commercial products.  Linux also performs better, he said.  Avalon is based
on a concept developed by Sterling four yearsago at the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration\'s Goddard Space Flight Center in
Maryland. 

Sterling said he and his colleagues realized the only way they could afford
the computing horsepower they needed was to build it themselves.  But while
they are doing it on a "back-of-the-garage, hobbyist budget," Sterling
said, the new type of machines are proving themselves among scientists who
need speed for their work.  Sterling runs a similar machine at Caltech,
Goddard continues to
use them, and a team at Sandia National Laboratories is developing a new
system based on the same concept. Sterling cautioned that there are some
scientific problems better suited to the traditional big commercial
machines.  Avalon-style machines are only good for problems that are easy
to divide up into little pieces so each individual computer in the stack
doesn\'t have to spend too much time sharing data with its neighbors.
"There are times when there is not only no advantage, but it\'s the wrong
thing to do," he explained.  But for the kind of scientific problems suited
to computer clusters like Avalon, he said, you can\'t beat the price.
"You\'re going to get 10 times the amount of science out of it for the same
bucks," he said.

Oddly enough, I\'ve seen a reference somewhere (Spinward Marches Campaign?)
that Jewell subsector *is* administered from Regina.  In any case, this 
makes sense.

Alternatively, "Duke of Five Sisters" or something similar could be a purely
administrative title given to whoever is the commodore of the Five Sisters
flotilla, as part of the job.  _Imperial Encyclopedia_ suggests that there
are a number of naval commands and high civil service positions that have
titles that go with the job.  (Admittedly, it still might not rate a whole
dukedom.)

Well, unarmed merchants do exist in the background (they

This "Mad Scientist" mode... perhaps these types of Vargr
are like the Brown Moties from _The Mote in God\'s Eye_:
genius technical and mechanical toolsmiths.

Use their intelligence rating as the limit on TL that they
can tinker at.

And be sure to give them social quirks and rotten charisma,
or else they WILL take over the galaxy.

Hey, this could make some corsairs very successful raiders,
if this mad scientist could sell them TL 16 military sensor

Quantum Computers

These babies are able to crack the best TL8 security in
1/100th the time... call them TL10 at least.  They are fast,
and break the silicon atomic-level restriction.

LEPs

Light-emitting polymers are the rage in TL8+? display technology,
clothing, and more.  LEP displays are flat, viewable at any
angle (unlike LCD), run on low voltage (5V), have crisper
resolution (you can stack the RGB pixels), and a great
alternative to OLEDs (Organic LEDs, which are lower power and
lower mass but might be more fragile).

LEP-embedded clothing can now change colors or provide stunning
graphics... with a few air motion sensors and some software,
color waves can flow liquidly across an outfit as relative
airspeed increases... or an image of a windmill on the front
of one\'s shirt can spin its blades at a variable speed 
depending on the speed of the air hitting its sensor...

Replacement Assault Rifle

For TL8+? the assault rifle of choice, which replaces
the M16, is lighter, computer controlled, and features 20-
or 30-clip magazines of (NATO) ammo, plus a nice 6-shot HEAP
magazine with computer-time-set fuses... the computer is in
the scope, and there are buttons around the trigger for
time adjustments, as well as dials on the scope for other
measurement adjustments.  Moreover, the two guns can separate,
with an optional trigger for the HEAP rounds.

At least IRL...you want to know why? Because we restrict the export of
supercomputers to _lots_ of places for a myriad of reasons.

Wanna break encryption schemes, design nukes, ICBM\'s, etc? Any problem
that just needs lots of cycles tossed at it is available, essentially
OTC...with software that\'s freely available anywhere in the world.

Remember the brouhaha that ensued when it was revealed that Toshiba had
sold supercomputers to the Soviets, enabling them to make quieter props
for their submarines? (part of it was also the CNC machines to do the
milling, too, but that\'s secondary)

I wanna see \'em _try_ to do export restrictions on PC\'s.

This isn\'t Traveller related, it\'s actually (choke) Real Life related.
  
	I\'ve recently come into a position as a recruiter for a technical
consulting firm in Seattle. I know a lot of you are programmers, so I
thought I\'d extend an offer to the list - if you\'re a programmer, project
manager, DBA, network admin, etc. and you\'re interested in consulting work
or in finding yourself a better job, email me your resume and if you\'ve
got the minimum requirements (basically 1 year work experience) I\'ll get
you in the door with my firm. I can\'t promise anything because I don\'t
make the hiring decisions, but I do screen resumes, so if I pass you into
the pool,  someone will review you.
	I\'d rather the position go to a Traveller player  ;)

send it to my work email: bboren@wdcorp.com

Take Care,
Ben

discussion about constructing a profitable merchant ship; it\'s within the realm
of possibility that these problems are related.  Key assumptions:

1)  Given the nature of ship design, we can assume that most cargo is
transported by several-thousand displacement ton heavy freighters, with small
crews, no streamlining, and probably J-1 or J-2.  Such ships are simply cheaper
(per ton of cargo space) than smaller ships.  We can assume that where
practical, trade between planets will be handled by such ships.
2)  Use of such ships is practical if (a) the port is capable of handling such
ships (via shuttles) and (b) total volume of transported materials is
sufficient to require such ships.  Heavy ships like that won\'t visit a planet
more often than they can reasonably fill their holds; if this results in less
than once a month there is a market for the small trader (who may be more
expensive, but gets the material there _now_ rather than later).  Note that it
doesn\'t take all that much trade for it to be efficient to obtain sufficient
shuttlecraft, so (a) and (b) are much the same issue.  It probably takes around
10,000 dT/year to make small traders obsolete.

So, the worlds which are serviced by free/far/subsidised traders are mostly
worlds with quite low trade -- probably fewer than 10 ships per month, with 3-5
ships in port at one time (say, 1000 dT average).  With a typical ratio of
military ships to merchant ships, this means your system defense needs are
probably handled by a couple of fighters, your system defense budget is
probably insufficient to support a SDB.  In addition, a patrol ship probably
comes through every 1-2 months.

Hm...this _isn\'t_ too bad of a place to commit piracy.  Of course, it\'s
probably also either pretty low tech or population code 5-....

Do you mean you just got the boardgame? I\'ve had it and loved it - one of
my all-time favorites. www.mpgn.com has a gaming center, go check it
out if you haven\'t. The only game in their "Space" category is Imperium, 
but they seem to have done it right.

Take a look, download the software, let me know - I can usually make
myself available after 9PM Eastern most evenings, email me.

	First off I\'d like to thank all the people that took the time to answer the
survey question. If you haven\'t answered you still can.

	Secondly I can\'t really state what\'s going on entirely yet as everything is
still undergoing negotiation. I\'m just trying to provide some useful input to
the parties involved. Maybe in another month or two a more formal announcement
might be made.

	Thirdly, the idea of an electronically based magazine was brought up as an
experimental idea, or as an add-on to the paper-based product. Some people
might even remember that Roger Sanger and I had tried to do so before, but
couldn\'t get permission too.

	However times have changed since than. The advent of the WWW has provided a
somewhat more universal format to present such material (as has Adobe PDF).
More people are online than they have been before. Distribution of RPG
material by other means has become somewhat more acceptable and even desired.
Problems with Distributors makes it harder for RPG companies to stay in
business, since some don\'t believe in making timely payments (or any
payments).

	I still believe a paper product is still required to be out there on the
market, how to do that might involve doing distribution in new ways. However
it would also be possible to expand upon the paper based product by providing
additional material in other formats (web and disk).

	How much it would cost to do this is still up in the air. Understandably the
more subscriptions, the cheaper it can be done and more can be done. For
instance, there  was at least one request to see more of the Keith Brothers
material. I have talked to them about this some months ago now, and while they
are not up to speed on the latest edition of the rules, there would be the
possibility of having them do some new stuff, though posibly for the old
rules, if the price was right (William was definitely willing to do some
Traveller artwork again, Keith was a little iffier), what that price might be
would understandably be needed to be discussed).

	The general response of the survey leaned towards a web-based subscription,
followed closely by a CD-ROM. A good compromise on costs here for everybody
seems to be the web-based subscription with a yearly CD-ROM release.

	The cost of doing CD-ROMS is still probably still to high to do on a
quarterly basis unless we really have a large number of subscribers. The costs
to do a run of 100 runs between $450-800, and drops to more acceptable levels
at about a run 500 and to about the costs of a paper based sub at about a run
of 1000). On top of those costs you need to add royalties, some payment for
time invested, maybe the authors would like payment and all that other Real
World Stuff <grin>.

	The format would be something like JTAS, but expanded in new ways that can\'t
be done on paper because of costs. Another advantage is that it would be
easier to support all melieus and rules sets.

    'index' => 'cn316',
    'topic' => 'Helping out pirates',
    'body' => 'This is some suggestions from the \'Realo\' faction of the anti-piracy forces
...

The first method is to assume an acute lack of bureaucracy in space - no
cross-checked cargo manifests, no Imperial Passports, no message/response
transponders linked to port of origin ... we could go on and on. Given the
Vilani influence on the Third Imperium, I think you would have to be very
frontier to have a lack of paperwork on multi-million credit starships.
Paperwork is also relativly cheap - hiring three hundred clerks at KCr 20
each per annum costs about, what, MCr 6 a year, or the maintainence cost of
a couple of fighters.

The second method is to cut the price of starships. The best way to do this
is to assume a combination of 20% volume discounts for standard designs,
with a 10% discount per TL built at below current state of the art, plus
10% discount per 10 years. Having a whole heap of obsolete rust buckets out
in the spaceways will cut the \'entry price\' of pirates down to mere
megacredits. Dropping the $^%^#@ 10 m3 minimum size of thruster plates can
also make \'speedboats in space\' viable, allowing cheap small craft. Oh
yeah, it also allows space missiles at TL11 rather than TL13 (if anyone
builds a decent missile without using t-playtes or Heplar, I have the
civilian det-laser warhead ... guaranteed immune to nuclear damper fields).

The third method is to increase the value of cargos. If cargos cost not the
KCr 10 per displacement ton or so but MCr 1 per displacement ton (not
unreasonable actually - check FFS2 for the prices of fission power plants,
sensor arrays and meson screens for example), then risking a beaten-up MCr
40 starship to capture a Fat Trader gets to be more worthwhile. You can
mesh this with the vanilla trade system by arguing that the \'purchase
price\' is just your equity in it (with higher values you need to damp down
the price differential per displacement ton, or trade gets too profitable).

The fourth method is to assume institutional corruption - in New South
Wales in Australia, the mostly-corrupt police Armed Holdup Squad allegedly
issued for several years what were in effect licences to do armed robberies
(the so-called \'green light\'). Having such a \'green light\' from some of the
local authorities would make life a lot easier for our prospective pirate.
It may be conditional on limiting attacks to certain systems (perhaps those
with Ine Givar-supplied deniability), or certain areas ("The Imperium
controls the space between the stars. The outsystem is a local
responsibility").

The fifth method is cutting sensor ranges. I personally dont like this one
- - even the traditional one lightsecond for civilians, three l/s for
military still puts detection range on or about the 100 diameter limit, and
thats without stationing a patrol ship at the 100 diameter limit.

The sixth method is by making point of entry in a new system random. This
IMO doesnt help pirates that much, especially not when combined with #5
above - you would have to be damn lucky to have a trader drop into your
lap, and if it gets enough time to accelerate it may not be able to slow
down even if it wants to.

The seventh method is by instituting risk premiums for travel to
pirate-affected systems. No trader in their right mind would go into a
system where there is a 2% chance of pirate attack - you are running a 2%
chance of losing a 50 megacredit ship, or losing MCr 1 on average (assuming
you value your life at nothing). Assuming 100 tons of cargo, you would have
to be paid KCr 10 per ton just to cover the risk premium. On the other
hand, you can build a pretty decent armed freighter (or blockade runner,
for that matter) if you assume you are being paid around KCr 5 per
displacement ton for freight (note to self ... do economic profile on the
Famile Spofulam Yards Drug Drug Runner Runner - a jump 2, 9 gee \'fast
extraction ship\'. I wonder what drug drug costs to produce, anyway). Such
high-gee armed freighters would provide \'fish\' for a pirate to swim in.

The eight method is to assume pirates dont need annual maintainence. I
really, really dont like this, unless it is going to be optional for
everybody. I suppose if you cut the additional misjump chance from +1 per
month missed to +1 per year missed it should even out for everybody.

The ninth method (and this is a real one-off) is to assume some pirate has
access to some sort of psionic power/magic widget/whatever that allows them
to induce misjumps in their ship at random, and thus outrun the Imperial
reaction. This could do real damage to canon if the Imperium duplicated it
(increases the speed of the x-boat net incredibly - who cares where you end
up, if you have a spare jump-3 worth of fuel and are within an empire of
11000 stars).

I\'ll add more if I think of them.

Several years ago I worked for Radio Shack, and we weren\'t allowed to

I\'ve just taken "Letter of Marque" to the printer...should have it back and
in the mail in one week. While it\'s been fun doing the limited TML paper
edition, I think a cd-rom would certainly be one valid way to go for any
future editions of LOM. 

With that in mind, I\'d like to announce that I\'ve just concluded a deal
with Andrew Keith to purchase the following previously unpublished
manuscripts - and I am certainly open to the cd route of release if Marc is
agreeable. My only desire is that they be released in their \'original\'
Classic Traveller form (i.e. as written). If someone wanted to produce a
companion article for the cd detailing the ways and means of converting
them to other versions of Traveller, that would be fine course.

The manuscripts are:

"Rogues in Space I: Letter of Marque" 
     We all know about this one...

"Rogues in Space II: \'Scams & Cons" (working title only)
       Interstellar Mafia anyone? Another in the boxed module series.

"Starport - Planetfall" 
       The *really* Complete Starport upon which the _Far & Away_ 
       articles borrowed a miniscule portion of material from. 
	Actually - "Startown" was supposed to have been the 
	companion-scenario followup book for this product. 

"Artic Environment" 
       Another in the hostile environment series - and Andrew has
expressed an interest in writing a companion-scenario book for        	this
as well.

And...saving the best for last...(believe me - I was up most of last night
reading it!)

"Faldor - World of Adventure"
	This was to have been another in the boxed module series. Like 	"Tarsus"
it is a fully detailed world - in this case, a formerly     	\'lost\' Darrian
colony which regressed to a lower tech level, and 	is presently rife with
Darrian, Sword World, Zhodani, and of 	course Imperial agents all striving
to sway the locals towards 	their own particular interests. Needless to
say....the 	\'primitives\' prove more than a match for them all. ;)

P.S. If he\'s listening, I\'d like to urge Roger Sanger to consider this
route for the release of the \'lost\' DGP gem - "The Black Duke".

In the interest of historical accuracy, it wasnt beaten to death. The
pro-piracy camp essentially said \'Merchant ships wont create a paper trail\'
and left it at that (in case anyone is interested, I work in fraud
prevention for a big government department. My job is identifying anomolous
paper trails, and most of my data is months out of date. I dream about
having free access to credit reference, Stock Exchange and bank data).

Essentially, the Imperial Navy, or elements thereof, drops over and beats
the crap out of the pocket empire supporting piracy.

The US Marines got the seocnd half of \'From the Halls of Montezuma to the
shores of Tripoli\' from such an exercise.

If the IN is unwilling to do so, then personally I would hire either
Instellarms, an Aslan Ihatei group or a mob of Vargr to beat the crap out
of the Pocket Empire instead. Or base your own privateers in the next
Empire over, and let the problem empire know that you have deeper pockets
than they do.

   With PCs/components being produced in the millions, and by many countries 
other than the USofA, any export restrictions the US may have are irrelevant, 
I suspect.

Along with the further mentioned web based generators I know of a

I myself programmed a word generator for DOS, which uses external tables
and so can generate most of the languages without problem. (Sometimes a

Doesn\'t stop them existing.  As a non-US person I can get the internaional
version of PGP encryption (with 4K-bit keys) from a
web site in Norway, yet I can\'t get the 128-bit key version of IE4
because of US export restrictions!  I\'ve noticed a number of
governments seem reluctant to drop laws and regulations that
become irrelevent ... as if trying to save face by ignoring the
fact they\'ve lost the initiative.

Now if this is a common behavior for governments then it should
be evidenced in Traveller ... both by planetary governments and
by the Imperium itself.

Here\'s an idea ... IIRC in CT you weren\'t allowed to tamper with
your ship\'s transponder, just turn it on or off.  This was because
pirates supposedly did give false transponder readings.  Now the
clever PCs might get round this by switching off their transponder
and mimicking its signals with the ship\'s main communications
system, the characteristics of which are easily changed without
physical evidence of wrong doing.  This might even be common
practice, yet the law about not tampering with the transponder
is left on the books.  This could be inconvienient when the
transponder gets damaged and the PCs do a DIY repair job ... and
then get hassled by the authorities for \'tampering\'.

I don\'t think anyone (except possibly you) will argue that a ship that
visits a starport to deliver a cargo or some passengers won\'t leave
some kind of a trail that can be followed up on.
 
Indeed, if Imperial tax practices is in any way like the practices of its
successor, the Regency (something I would consider _very_ likely), then
every passenger and every ton of cargo will be taxed and thus generate a
paper trail.

But just delivering a cargo or a passenger will leave behind witnesses
who can tell that you were there on that particular date.

Try working out the economies of the idea. If they are just grabbing cargoes,
the added number of jumps between their base and their hunting ground will
cut down on their effective hunting time and require much more valuable
cargoes to support them.

>main pirates) may be a quick way to upgrade your tech level as well as

Well, if the pirates are grabbing whole ships and have a market for them,
the economic side of the problem may be solvable. Just one ship per year can
keep a Corsair grade ship in the black (may have to grab a few if the
prey is 40-year old Free Traders). But that will depend on several factors
and assumptions: How much time does the pirate spen in transit and how much
time in a system where prey may appear? What are the odds that suitable
prey will appear before an Imperial patrol? What are the odds of capturing
the prey? Again, you really need a proper example to show that it is
possible. In any case there is one absolute proviso: The pocket empire will
have to be sure that the Imperium will not come calling. There\'s only two
ways that can happen: 1) The Imperium never finds out, or 2) The Imperium
do not feel strong enough to come calling. I suppose the first option is
possible if you believe that insurance investigators and Imperial
intelligence agents are unable to track down these ships. As for the second
option, history shows that those pirate sancturaries that were actually
known remained inviolate only as long as the nations suffering their
depredations were too busy elsewhere to muster the strength to deal with
them (Check the Barbary Pirates and the Uskoks for two examples).
 
There\'s also the problem that preventing the loss of even one ship per year
will support a patrol ship. After just a few losses the insurance carriers
will propably begin hiring patrol ships, assuming for purposes of argument
that the Imperial Navy wouldn\'t supply a few escorts of their own (A very
iffy assumption IMO). Remember, a single squadron of half a dozen destroyers
or escorts will make any single destination too hot for Corsair sized pirates.
(Note: I said destination, not system; some systems may have more than one
destination).

We don\'t know what the typical ratio of military ships to merchant ships is,
because we don\'t know how many merchant ships so-and-so many people "support",
the way we do with military ships. But if the number of private merchant
protectors (either free-lance or employed by insurance agencies) is similar
to the Al Morai establishment, they equal roughly 3% of the value of the
merchant shipping. If the 10 ships you are talking about (at two jumps per
month, the number of ships per month is the same as the total number of
ships) are 40 year old Free Traders, they would be worth MCr1,500 (A new
Free Trader costs MCr60, IIRC). 3% of that is MCr45. Not enough to provide
a full-time patrol ship for the system, but enough for a decent SDB. But
that is only the private side of protection. It dosen\'t account for any
local planetary forces or any reserve or regular fleet ships.

Of course, the moment you change some of those Free Traders into Far Traders
or Subsidized Merchants you make them worth more. Same if you make them
newer.

Ask the same question about the real world(tm). Tech levels do vary by a
great deal from country to country and money rules here as well.
If the real world has TL differances then Traveller should as well, right?

There are several possible answers of varying degrees of likelihood and
potential veracity, but basically (IMO) it comes down to the fact that the
planets are randomly generated.  I might say "hey, It\'s just a game", but I
can feel the stirrings in my digits that require me to lift them up and
wave them around in the following fashion;

What follows is a guideline in My Traveller Universe.  You mileage may
vary, but I do blieve in Canon (I do! I do!), and this is how I choose to
interpret it.

Tech Level is a measure of what products can be produced on a given world.
In order to produce a product, much more than, say, a sample of such a
product is needed to produce that product.

For example, You can bring a Sony Discman to The Republic of Congo
(randomly selected "third world" country), their people can take it apart,
figure out how it works, try to reproduce it, but without the
infrastructure of chemical companies, wire manufacturers, plastic makers,
chip manufacturers, the construction techniques and equipment to build the
appropriate plants and tools,  etc they will not be able to reproduce the
item.  There is simply too much technological infrastructure needed to do
so.

So, why doesn\'t a high tech world move in and take over?  Well, The
Imperium frowns a bit on that sort of relationship, but that would not keep
it from happening sometimes.  The real reasons are more economic, and there
are several possibilities (which, I think, all happen somewhere), and some
general conditions which apply.

First the individual cases

1). The high tech planet wants that low tech planet around and independent
to provide markets, cheap labor, and to sell its raw resources cheaply to
the high tech planet.  The relationship is roughly similar to the Imperial
era on Earth; Industrial countries like England, The Netherlands, France
and Spain colonized less developed areas and turned them into markets for
their finished goods and sources of valuable raw materials or materials not
available locally.  A likely twist is that, if the high tech planet takes
over, the caputuring government will probably have to dump a lot of money
into the new colony to follow it\'s own laws/standards (i.e. provide
"minimum wage" and welfare/healthcare/basic services).

2). The higher tech world may, in fact, take over the lower tech world.
This is the source of all those planets with the subject government type.

3). The world in question may not be worth taking over because of the lack
of valuable local resources (worth exporting).

4). The world may not be near enough to any high tech aggressive world to
be taken over.

Now some general conditions;

1). Raising the tech level of a planet is *expensive*.  It takes a lot of
people to provide a worthy infrastructure, and it takes a lot of investment
in infrastructure over time to build a high tech world.

2). Taking over a world is *expensive*, transporting troops (even high tech
numerically inferior quantities) and their equipment requires a tremendous
amount of hull tonnage, and their supplies must follow for at least some
time.

3). Many planets are *worthless*.  To have value a planet must have people
(colonizing is also a very expensive prospect) and resources.  The UPP does
not generally reflect resources (except air and water, which are very
important actually) but it does reflect population, and with almost 50% of
the planets having pop 6 or less (and most less) there is a lot of
uninhabited ground in the Imperium.

4). Many planet\'s governments are not interested in taking over another
planet. Many (most) worlds have their own problems.  Taking over a lower
tech neighbor is low on their list of things to do, especially if they have
their own revolutionaries, droughts, Union Strikes, political elections,
economic woes, etc. etc. to deal with.  It takes a determined populace and
aggressive, charismatic government to wage a war across parsecs against
another planet, and most worlds have other things to think about.

5). In the context of the Imperium, taking over other worlds in not usually
considered kosher.  Outside the Imperium and other organized goverments may
be different, but then the resources are even fewer and further between.
The Imperial Government wants planets to exist as independent members of
the Imperium.  Now, there are some captive government types around that are
generally "owned" by some nearby planet\'s government.  I would call this
the exception, and expect to find some valuable resource or cultural
animosity at the root of the reason for the takeover.

I guess that\'s aenough for now.

IMTU, the players campaign area is just recently pulling out of a Long
Night situation (very long night, at least 8,000 years or so), so there
are lots of old colonies that have slipped in tech during that time.

Pirates! Did I hear someone say <gasp> PIRATES!!!!!  Seriously, IMTU,
piracy doesnt work very well, resources to support ships is stretched a
bit thin, hard enough to maintain a legit vessel.  Mercenaries work
though.

Let\'s see: if they are _new_ free traders, that\'s (10*60)=600 MCr, which gives
a defense budged of $18 MCr.  We\'ll assume that actually is accurate, because
planetary defense ships are subject to depreciation too.

Now, those 10 ships are making transits between two worlds.  Thus, 9 MCr at
each end.

Of course, a typical ratio of military expenses to merchant expenses might be
closer to 5-6%, and might climb as high as 10% on minor worlds (this is _all_
expenses, government and merchant included).  That lets us assume 30 MCr in
system defense.

In the interest of historical accuracy, it wasnt beaten to death. The
pro-piracy camp essentially said \'Merchant ships wont create a paper trail\'
and left it at that.

Well, no.  I was beaten to death and I, for one, never claimed they
would leave _no_ paper trail.  The debate go into wether transponders
can be fooled, what codes exists, how easy it was to forge documents,
how often they would be checked, etc.  This was all hashed of repeatedly
when this first(?) become an issue a year or two ago.  It all came
down to, as much of this does, with how you see the Imperium workings.

True, since even I don\'t argue that.  The question was wether the
paper trail is a "broad" one (and how accurate it is).

Okay, this lost me. Where does the MCr 1,500 figure come from? If new they
are 60 MCr a piece new, then 10 would only have a value of 600 MCr, no?

WGN\'s part of deluxe cable here & all I have is basic.  But ToledoVison 5 has Animaniacs at 3:30 PM M-F, followed by Pinky & The Brain, and Sunday morning they do both again.

ObTrav:

Which do you think owuld make the better Vargr, Pinky & The Brain or the Warners?

  Well, I\'m not going to touch the "who builds/buys Corsairs" thing :) It\'s not
necessarily clear what the tables mean to throw up, and clarification of said
tables is easy and has almost no impact on canon.

>Also, he has a computer no better than his prey, his maneuver drive is 1G,

  All quite true. Hopefully his prey is suffering from some temporary
dysfunction
(it is often 40+ years old), he/she may have a heavier than average weapons load
and/or good gunners or the target may be markedly substandard in these
respects -
a Far Trader would have a better comp, IIRC. The paper trail is irrelevant until
such time as an act of piracy is attempted (which may never occur for a given
subject), and then things get exciting.

  If nobody is around, you can ditch the target for recovery later, decoupling
yourself from the paper trail relating to its\' loss. The cargo and or ship can
either be picked up later or "salvaged" _years_ later. Either of these could
involve selling to a non-pirate organized crime group, or it could be directly
utilized for shuttling goods from one outer system/deep space rendezvous to
another to help more conventional smugglers avoid leaving too obvious paper
trails.

  Ultimately my point is that this "potential" pirate can exist in sufficient
quantities to meet the "piracy threat" role without being subject to the same
limitations as renders some of the others problematic.

1) IN-service, yes; detached service, probably not. (meaning no, the
PC\'s cannot just drop in and refuel/resupply. They may be able to if the
navy portmaster is asked prettyplease with a cherry on top, likes
scouts, and can charge back the IISS. Since the IISS uses these
occasions to debrief the detaches scouts, I\'d say it was unlikely to be
a common occurence.

There is a single central government which is responsible for a
very limited set of functions - one specific function that could
best be called medical, plus minor ancillary functions such as
maintaining and managing a common currency. Employees/agents/
officials/functionaries are selected and assigned jobs primarily
on essential ability (and there is a chronic shortage of
properly-trained and skilled individuals).

Subordinate but largely autonomous are territorial governments,
whose primary functions are managing regional and
interterritorial trade.  These territorial governments have
effective diplomatic powers for managing certain aspects of
relationships between territories or between citizens of
different territories.  There are laws governing who may or may
not be a citizen of a territory; for various reasons, someone
born in one territory may not be eligible for citizenship in that
territory, and in fact may be in danger of being killed if they
do not leave the territory at majority.  Territories may assess
taxes for various purposes which seem good to that territory, and
apportion them accordingly.

Subordinate to the territories are counties, which may assess
property taxes for certain purposes. Counties may also raise
militias, and regulate subregional commerce.  They are also
influential in the decision on routes in the transportation
network, although the territorial government generally makes the
final decisions.

Counties are made up of municipalities, which have essentially
the same (or greater) home-rule powers that one sees in
municipalities in much of the United States.

The overall population density is roughly that of the nebulous
area of the United States that\'s south of the Rust Belt, north of
the Sun Belt, and east of the Corn Belt (or on its eastern
fringe) - very few large cities (almost none with a population as
high as 750,000), many small towns, with plenty of open space
between the towns.  

TL is somewhat variable - from candles and iceboxes in many areas
(but light bulbs and refrigerators in others) to what are
essentially maglevs for intermunicipal transportation, personal
autos are either internal combustion or electric, state-of-the-
art for information technology is printed books (assume hot metal
presses), photography is box cameras and glass plates, and
writing is at the fountain-pen-and-inkwell stage; medicine is
fundamentally what we would call "alternative" (but it really
works!); although "mainstream" technologies such as transfusion
and surgery are known, and pharmaceuticals are also known, they
are used much less frequently than in pre-starflight Terra.

Well, it al depends on how that government derives it\'s power; after
all, that\'s what governs a government type. As stated, _any_ traveller
government type would qualify.

Is the governemnt eelected, imposed, a dictatorship, a corporate state,
a anarcho-syndicalist commune?

Depends upon their reaction to the aslan. If they turn over unused lands to
aslan settlers, they will probably be allowed to continue almost unaffected.

If they resist, they may be toast. If they welcome them, slow integration.

Most batteries are exothermic during charging... and many are exothermic
duing discharge. Real batteries always lose energy both ways (in and out).
Capacitors also have heat based entropic losses, as do electric
non-superconductors. FWIW, I read that even lot-temp (as opposed to
cryogenic) superconductors lose energy to radiation and heat.

Also, how are you converting the heat into energy you can store?

Why haven\'t tech levels evened out on Earth? Because there\'s no reason
for the folks with the high tech *to* give it away to the low tech
people, and the low tech people can\'t *afford* to buy much of it. 

As most colonial empires on Earth found out, it\'s easier to let the
natives run the country (planet) and just buy the resources from them.
Especially when you have something they need (like spare parts for such
high tech as they have). 

You can\'t really support most high tech from "outside". You need to
have native industry if you want more than a small amount of high tech
stuff. 

Consumer goods are easy because they either aren\'t *worth* fixing (who
fixes a cheap transistor radio when it breaks?) It\'s cheaper to buy a
replacement. And if the item is relatively rugged, it\'ll sell. If it
isn\'t, only the richer natives will have one, because only they can
afford to replace/repair it frequently. 

"Industrial" and "miltary" type equipment will be limited to the sort
of things that can be repaired by *local* techs using imported parts.
And preferences will be given to items which can be maintained more
easily. That is, with either locally availble tools, or a minimum of
skills or with cheap parts.

The exceptions will be equipment that the natives feel they need badly
enough to pay for imported technians, and expensive spare parts. 

So even low tech worlds are likely to have some "hi tech" gear. Radios
are a likely candidate. A few cheap satellites in orbit and you can
broadcast stuff to the whole planet. Heck, even the Romans would see
the advantages to being able to get info to the people that quickly and
without it getting distorted. And things like weather reports, and
educational broadcasts are worthwhile too. 

Another possibilitie is two-way radios, or more likely something along
the lines of a satellitte based cell phone system. Even if they are
limited to the "upper crust" , they are still damned useful.

And they\'ll pay for such medical stuff as they can use within their
infrastructure. 

Note that this is almost exactly how the highest tech gets into "third
world" countries now. 

This also has some interesting effects on adventures. Like when the
players find out that the native guide who seems to be uncannily good
at predicting the weather has been checking the weather broadcasts from
the satellite network. 

Or when they discover that after they escaped from some incident in a
remote location, the word got spread all over by using cell phones :-).

And the local "witch doctor" may be using imported drugs and
technology. Heck, given what we\'ve learned over the years, I suspect
that it\'d be both more profitable and *less* disruptive for the medical
companies and even "charity" type medical organizations to enlist the
aid of the local "doctors" even if they are some sort of shaman. 

Not only will this avoid turf fights, but by allowing the locals to
"save face", they are going to have a better chance of getting info on
"native remedies" from them. And as we\'ve learned here on earth, some
of those turn out to be important new drugs. 

It\'ll take a little longer to set up, but in the long run, you\'d wind
up with more care going to the natives *and* more info/profits going to
the off-worlders. 

And who\'s to say that getting your antibiotics combined with the
traditional healing ceremonies *won\'t* get you well faster. Even if
it\'s just a placebo effect, it works!

And BTW, don\'t discount tradition as a reason why a culture *doesn\'t*
go "hi tech". They may well decide that they don\'t *want* many of the
"benefits". And it\'ll be a rare case when there\'s much profit in
forcing something on them. It\'s easier to find a planet where the
natives are willing to buy what you are selling. :-)

They are quite relevant TO PEOPLE IN THE US. 

The classic example (which is worthy of being incorporated into a
Traveller scenario) is a researcher who bought a PC clone in Bulgaria
(this was *before* the fall of the USSR). He got it back to the US with
no trouble. Then when he tried to take it with him on his next trip to
Eastern Europe, customs wouldn\'t let him!

  That brings up the question of how applicable the RSB taxation description
(p. 7) is to the earlier 3I. Admittedly it doesn\'t say that any of those tax
bases are innovations, and further I\'ll assume that the author did check with
other GDW staff for ideas. I guess as a CT person I\'d have to ask whether TNE
players felt that TNE material (and the RSB in particular) was accurate enough
to be applied to the preceding game settings.

  Did TNE entail changes in freight and passage charges?

So what you do is don\'t deliver them to a starport, use what most criminals
use, a fence. Find a merchant who will take the goods and resell them as his
own thus generating a brand new \'legitimate\' paper trail. The old goods just
disappear. It\'s a bit like laundering money really, but you do it with cargo
instead.

Yeah, and you can still get AK-47\'s cheaper in Somalia
than in the US. In Eritrea during the war with Ethiopia (a
civil war by some descriptions) the locals were able to
_make_ copies of AK-47\'s using metal recovered from shot
down aircraft, in underground workshops with minimal
tools. 

Some high tech business decides that it\'s cheaper to 
produce computer parts in Korea than in the Us, and twenty 
years later Korea has a very fine technology thank you.

The Empire works on a scale of centuries rather than 
decades. There hasn\'t been huge technological advances in 
the wealthier states, (the max-TL has hardly moved in 300 
years) so I can\'t see why TL doesn\'t seep.

Consider also that regardless of whether a planet is Tech 6 
or not, if it has trade contacts with the Empire, you can 
bet that they have tech 10 ACR\'s at the least, and probably 
higher. 

Consider the Maori in New Zealand in the 1840\'s -- 
they had almost no industry, but they bought muskets off 
the europeans and proceeded to have a series of bloody 
high-tech (by the lights of the day) wars.

I also agree with Peter Brenton about TL being mostly a 
measure of industrial base. If a planet is TL12, it can 
produce TL12 goods. I can easily imagine a TL 4 planet that 
imports TL12 farm machinery to work the land, becuase the 
payoffs in production of agricultural produce are worth the 
interplanetary hard currency. TL is not a very good 
indicator of what equipment the locals will have, just what 
they don\'t have to import.

Look in your Traveller book regarding TL of a planet.
The maximum TL that can be LOCALLY PRODUCED.
Your TL 6 planet will have all those neato high TL gadgets that they can
afford but their basic infrastructure will be TL 6.
How is Somalia wired, what is the basic mode of transportation there, how
is food produced, old, packaged etc etc.

If you are going to put these on CD then I suggest that they be in a
format that anyone can read.  ie. Adobe Acrobat.

Those of us with Mac\'s can read disks and CD\'s formated for Wintell machines,
we just have to be able to run the files on them.  There are programs that are

I made a basic decimal error. The MCr1,500 should be MCr150, based on the
assumption that a 40 year old ship is worth ~25% of its original cost.

ad 1:

As the law level only states the weapons that are not allowed to be used,
how do I find out about conviction and punishment methods, if someone acts
against other laws and gets catched? Maybe combination Gov/Law and Pop can
help with this?

Will the criminals be
- - imprisoned (in a prison like Alcatraz, Devils Island, or Manhattan)
- - imprisoned in public (a kind of modern pillory)
- - imprisoned at home (with a surveillance device attached or subcutan)
- - imprisoned virtually (in a cyber-prison)
- - deep-frozen (Cold Berths)
- - banned (If someone else wants you then)
- - re-educated (Brainwash or Zhodani method ...)
- - convicted to death, yes or no?

I\'m looking for some \'interesting\' ways of punishment and criminal
prosecution, so that my characters have to find out what to do if one of
them fails in upholding the law.

Some ideas that came to me yet are from \'Star Trek: TNG - Justice\', and a
view of a community, where each lawbreaker gets a punishment, which puts
him into a situation equal to his victim\'s. (i.e. kidnappers are locked
up, thieves lose their possessions, killers get ... hm.)

What did you use/see/think of?


ad 2:

For my campaign I am searching for metals used by the ancients for their
artifacts. What is valuable in the Traveller universe? I use Iridium and
Lanthanum by now, and I know of some coyns consising of Gold, Platinum or
Uranium. The idea is to get six \'wands of power\', each being a bar of an
other metal. What could be the meaning of each metal? 
(e.g. Lanthanum for Jumpdrives - motion trough space,
      Uranium for nuclear power - energy,
      etc ...)

Perhaps this will get you some ideas, too.

Oh, was that the question? Let me try answering it then: Broad enough to be
easily followed by anyone willing to spend a few man-years on it. That seems
to be broad enough for the purpose of making it hazardous to alternate
between tranding and pirating. Which was the question as far as I was
concerned.

How about high-efficiency thermionic diodes? With 11,000 worlds

    'body' => 'Some points:

1. I think Hans hit the nail on the head when he mentioned tying
   system defense to interstellar commerce.  This idea seems
   reasonable to me, since the Imperium may well protect systems
   inasmuch as they are commercially important... which usually
   includes politically important worlds, by the way, but not
   always I suppose.

2. In order to make sense of Imperial protection you may want to use 
   some Imperial worlds to test your hypotheses... or else the 
   arguments seem kind of hollow.  In any case, using world stats to 
   deduce rules from, or induce rules into, helps harmonize your system 
   with actual Traveller data.

3. The resulting rules of thumb will help you assess the possibility
   of piracy.  That\'s why I\'ve been working on my trade rules.  I
   want to see what worlds will have pirates, if any.  Just thinking
   it will or won\'t work isn\'t enough for me; I need to convince
   myself and my group that a reasonable system exists which can
   allow piracy, and then go by that system.

4. One reason I\'m not basing budget on the number of traders is that
   I\'m not sure how to calculate the value and number of traders 
   working a route.  Assume the average ship size is X, multiply it
   times MCr Y and number of ships Z... you see, I need passenger and 
   cargo numbers anyhow, just to find out what kinds and how many 
   ships are trafficking.

IMTU INTERSTELAR TRADE

One week\'s interstellar trade on any world, again IMTU, depends on

	starport class
	population
	TL
	gas giant, naval base, xboat route presences

and also, for each neighbor,

	the same values noted above AND
	the distance from said neighbor 


IMTU SYSTEM DEFENSE

IMTU, the budget for local defense is, for now, equal to one week\'s
interstellar trade.

For example, IMTU Rhylanor-Porozlo has a weekly traffic of 200,000
people, and perhaps 800,000 tons of cargo.  Assuming Cr6000 per passenger 
and Cr1000 per ton of cargo, the weekly gross revenue is

	Cr 2,000,000,000

2 billion credits per year for local defense at each world.
Taking Jae Tellona into account may raise those numbers a bit more.

For another example, Treece has a weekly traffic of 20 people and
perhaps 80 tons of cargo, yielding

	Cr 200,000

...which is therefore the defense budget for Treece.

Now, do those numbers seem reasonable?

Protection will be dependent on political importance, but this is typically
equal to commercial importance.  However, worlds can acquire sudden political

As a rule, the value of ships along a particular route should be 200-500 times
the cost of transit along that route, since the cost of transit is a function
of the cost of ships.  Of course, the cost of transit really shouldn\'t be flat
in any case.

Assuming that\'s yearly budget, this is reasonable, though some worlds will for

The number of people is probably high -- transit is expensive and slow, and

I, too, feel that the number is too high. My sense is that one should look
at Earth sea transport for ideas rather than to air transport. I think it was
Hans who worked from the concept that a High Passage cost a year\'s pay, 
if one considers the average per capita income to be Cr10,000. This would tend
to limit the numbers considerably. Air travel is (relatively) too inexpensive
to use as a model for numbers.

Idly, I wonder how many people take cruises each year? That might be an interesting
statistic.

I see the proposed number of passengers and wonder what would generate that
much traffic. 

In playing around a bit with Rob\'s formula, I note that it computes traffic
as an exponential function. I think it ought to tail off toward the upper end,
but I am not sure how to express it mathematically. I am reminded of the
curve that describes the population of a microbial colony over time. Initially,
it is slow growing, but eventually skyrockets until it starts running out of
room and then levels off. I want to come up with something I can use to 
generate average traffic levels to provide local color as much as anything
else.

enough rambling for now...

yours,
Michael

Consider that Rylanor has 8 billion, and Porozlo has 20 
billion. 
Assume that on average most people make one return trip in their 
lifetime, also assume that the average lifespan is 80 
years, and that the travel will be evenly spread over that 
time. Assume that all the passengers will be going between 
those two worlds (Jae-Tellona is a bit of a dead end).
28 billion return trips over 80 years is 350 million per 
year, or 129,000 per week. 258000 if you count both 
directions.

I think I might be being a little out in my assumptions, 
but I don\'t think by an order of magnitude. If you still 
think that Robert\'s numbers are way too high, please 
address which of my assumptions you consider to be 
drastically unreasonable, and I\'m prepared to discuss it.

Why assume that?  I wouldn\'t.  Going from Rylanor to Porozlo is equivalent to
travelling from the US to Europe in the 19th century -- it takes more than a
week each way, and it\'s expensive.  At times people will do it -- even large
numbers of people will do it -- but most likely not over 10% of the population
_ever_ makes the trip, and very few people make it more than once.

About an order of magnitude seems right.

Well, I don\'t see it as being a matter of man-years.  If the
ship did a good job of not leaving enough information to follow,
then it won\'t matter how much time they spend.  If it didn\'t,
and that ship is selected to be checked, then I would say
it would take a man-week or so (and a month or two of real
time).

If it does take a few man years, it won\'t be a problem.  If this
is a way of detecting who is a pirate, then you have to go
through every single ship\'s papers to be sure of catching
the pirates.  At a few man-years on each, that will add
up fast.

It changed the price of a middle passage in the wilds to Cr5000, with
doubling up of accomodation, but that was about it. In fact the cargo rules
are straight out of MT, blast it (I prefer the CT rules for their colour).

They also upgraded their agricultural and shipbuilding TL very quickly, to
the great irritation of the English (who planned on the Maori being a

On the other hand, the entire population of both systems will take

OK...when I played around with the exponent, I found it was quite

It is now legit to sell 386\'s to the Former Soviet Union... But I know a
few guys on probation for having sold 486\'s back when the pentium was still
known as the "Upcoming 10586". Also, I know a smuggler who Smuggles SKS and
AK-47 rifles from russia. He ususally takes a 486 (bought cheap and used)
and 3-4 pairs of Levi\'s 501\'s. Usually gets 2-3 cases of rifles. I can\'t
verify his trade out, but I can verify having seen some product: he had a
case of ak-47\'s in the back of his car, all still in the cosmoline, with
original manuals (in russian)... not much to look at, either (the manuals).
He was asking a mere $250 US...

He trades in international waters, during the winter, on a snow machine
with towed trailer. (Yes, they DO make trailers for snowmachines). During
the depths of winter, you can cross from Alaska to Eastern Siberia/
Kamchatka via the icepack, if far enoguh north.

Piracy, at least in terms of a career of criminal spacer behaviour, and not
limited to JUST siezing ships and cargos, exists. It is possible to have a
career of criminal space employment, including (but not limited to)
Piratry, Barratry, Smuggling, Blockade enforcement, "Protection Rackets"
involving "Hired Customs Agent" and similar scams, interspersed with more
leagal activities including escort-for-hire and bloackade running, as well
as support for mercenaries. Basically, I see the distinction between pirate
and merchant as one of willingness and frequency of use of violence.

I agree with Hans\' points about IMPERIAL NAVY protection being based upon
trade volume.

HOWEVER, I think we\'ve all overlooked one segment of the Imperial Prescence
which is nearly omni-present, and would make piracy less likely... the IISS!

Based upon The Traveller Adventure, Bk 6:Scouts, and several other sources,
I believe that nearly every system will have some scout prescence, even if
only a 3 or 4 being office, for interfacing with the local (planetary)
postal &/or e-mail service. Any system on an X-boat route has an X-boat
tender (or more). Systems not on the routes will have at least 1, ususally
two, scout couriers to carry x-mail to/from the system. So, we have a wide
network of scout craft around. Since it can be assumed that scouts will
lovingly maintain their craft (if only out of boredom), expected (and thus
amortized) lifespan will be somewhere around 80-100 years, after which the
ship will often be surplused or "reserved" or assigned to a Detatched Scout.

Since this puts scouts almost everywhere, scouts will encounter and REPORT
piracy more than the Navy. If the pirate is quick, efficient, and takes
cargo &/or valuables (IMTU, theft is not an imperial crime, but murder,
treason, hijack, and mutiny are, as is treason) but avoids taking lives,
and lets the victim go, they scout may "avoid the hassle", and ignore it. A
violent or ruthless pirate WILL get reported. If the scout craft feels
brave, or is sufficiently large/armed, may even pursue.

Also, scouts, based upon every reference I have read about them in cannon,
ARE UBIQUITOUS. EVERY imperial will recognize the scout insignia, much like
most everyone recognizes the local Postal Uniform.

Also, I figure that, based upon the costs of X-Boat ops, the scouts just
barely clear on Commo Branch ops costs... support that with a few percent
of the anti-piracy funds, and the ubiquity of the X-boat/Courier net makes
some sense besides governance.

I agree that it\'s expensive, and IMTU I\'d probably set the
average yearly salary higher than 10k (perhaps double) or 
make ships a _lot_ cheaper.

I\'m not convinced that the 19thC is necessarily the best
comparison. Yes, the paradigm of the long travel times,
but no faster communication is a good one, but I think
that the wealth distribution was a lot more skewed than it
is now, and I\'d like to think that the wealth distribution
in the average Traveller system isn\'t as bad as that. 

In the 19thC England a lot of people lived on subsistance, but 
there were an upper class of people that were comparitively 
extremely wealthy. Yes, maybe only 10% could expect to travel, but I 
would have thought that 5% would have been able to afford 
regular travel if they wanted to.

I guess my image fits more with the "Titanic" paradigm. The 
rich travel in stunning comfort, and the poor just travel 
as best they can, but the poor still travel.

That said, I\'d be comfortable downsizing the guess to 
50% of the population can expect to travel in their 
lifetime, and I\'m prepared to be convinced lower.

It\'s TL12.

Assume 100 MJ of output is required. It isnt exactly Famile Spofulam
standard (Ditzie is working on the meson gun missile warhead even as we
write), but it\'s higher-rated than some main lasers on military designs
from some design bureaus.

Assume range required is 5 000km - it\'s a civilian weapon.

One meter diameter, turns into roughly 0.09 cubic meters of laser. Call it
0.1 m3. Lasers range is 25 000 km. Plenty. Cost is KCr 10.

5 000km beam pointer for 0.948 m3, and KCr 95 or so.

We need 500 megajoules worth of energy, so we pack in 500 kilos of chemical
laser cartridge, at a cost of KCr 2.5

Now we need the combustor/evacuator. We want a RoF of, say, one shot per
ummm. Well, it\'s a one shot weapon, isnt it ... assume on shot per 20 minutes.

Thats 1 shot per 1200 seconds, so we need a combustor/evacuator of ummm
call it 25 liters. My guess is the missile interior is going to be a mess
of melted plastic after that half-ton chemical cartrige goes. Then again,
who cares ?

OK. It\'s one shot, so no autoloader will be required.

Add a 50 kkm laser communicator, for 0.02 m3 and KCr 36.

Total volume is therefore about 1.7 cubic meters, with over half of that
being the beam pointer.

Cost is about KCr 154, and dominated by the beam pointer. You could
probably get away with building the laser bits on a TL12 world, and then
installing a TL9 beam pointer. It would be about a half-cubic meter bigger,
but may have a much lower sticker cost, depending on the exchange rate.

If you want terminal self-guidance, I\'d put in a TL12 sensitivity 11.5
vehicle passive sensor, costing KCr 100. It shouldnt be neccessary against
civilian targets, but if you are goanna play with high gee targets, you
might need it. On the other hand, a high gee target may well have mil
blacking and so on that would spoof such a cheap and tacky sensor.

OK. One 2m3 civilian det laser. Cost is about KCr 154, potentially less if
built with a TL9 beam pointer, more if you want terminal self-guidance.
Only two rules have been bent - there is no minimum RoF for Chemical
Cartridge Lasers, and I have ignored the requirement for an autoloader on
the grounds it\'s a one-shot weapon.

What situation would you have to be in to spend CR1000 on a low berth
instead of CR8000 on a middle passage, considering the risks of low
passage travel? Considering how many low passengers you can find on
any planet of the Imperium, the original rules would indicate a lot of
desperate people, with almost no money, willing to gamble their lives
on a fresh start on a new planet - and this new planet has a similar
population of malcontents. No wonder the Imperium has so many problems
with crime and internal peacekeeping.

Needless to say, I have always found the Kieth brothers Traveller (or even
2300 AD) material to be the best of what was produced for that game system.
 If there is any unreleased material out there, or if, they might actually
do new stuff, this would a great boost for Traveller.

Btw, Chris, do you mind if I put a link to your generator on my page? Or
even have a copy to download from there, as I\'ve loads of space.

Finally, Lars Adler says that he\'s written a DOS-based generator, but I
don\'t have a URL available. Fancy making it available Lars? I\'ll provide
the web space for it if you like.

I think that\'s all, have I missed anything out?

On rec.arts.sf.science they\'ve been discussing the old Safeguard
anti-missle defense system and especially the Sprint missile, which was
the "point defense" component.

Sprint boosted at 100g. And could *manuever* at a fair fraction of
that. 

It was derived from a test vehicle that boosted at *1000* g. And thus
reached orbital velocity in one *second*. 

I\'m trying to track down more info, as using such missiles for the
final stage of a missile launched at a ship would make point defense
rather difficult. The main *dis*-advantage is that they can\'t maintain
that acceleration for more than a fraction of a turn. On the other
hand, that\'s all it may take to attack the target.

It\'s not a matter of *efficiency*. A thermionic diode works off of heat
*differences*. Which means that you have to have a "cold end" for the
heat to flow to.

The problem is that in space, you only have two choices for the "cold
end". One is the interior of the ship, which means the ship is
steadfily getting hotter. The other is some sort of radiatyor aimed at
empty space. And you can\'t dump heat to it any faster than the heat
*radiates* away. Otherwise the temp goes up, and the efficiency drops
like a rock.

Actually, if you use the right fuel/oxider combo, you can get a *rocket
engine* to lase. The beam will be at right angles to the gas flow. And
you\'ll actually get a decent thrust out of the exhaust, as the laser is
taking energy from the *combustion*, while the rocket is taking energy
from the *expansion* of the exhaust. 

So your one shot, if designed appropriately may be able to dodge at
high acceleration while firing. :-)

And frankly, I think that if one is going to do a chemical laser
warhead, one *should* design it this way. It\'d cost more, but be a lot
more surviveable.

Not entirely clear from the books in question - the municipal
governments are definitely representative democracies (think
mayor/city manager, city council/board of aldermen, etc.); none
of the others are clear, but the central government has the
overwhelming support of the people, is not elected in any way,
and gets its personnel at all levels through drafting those who
are most qualified to fill the positions - and the person so
drafted willingly goes.

That is to say, the cost is high, but not unreachable even for the middle
classes.  It is costly enough to dissuade many people, however, and many
others are dissuaded based on the inconvenience.  A planet is a big place;
interplanetary tourism would be even harder to encourage than
intercontinental tourism.  But I think it would exist.

I would say 10 percent, maybe 20 percent of the population of a high-tech
(TL10+) world would do an interstellar trip at least one time in their
life.  Since space travel has been around quite a while, there would not be
much novelty factor involved, and as I mentioned before most non-wealthy
people would likely not travel interstellar for tourism, when they have a
whole world of their own available.

People living on an asteroid or in a dome city might want to travel to
another world for a vacation, but then again people raised in that kind of
environment might be a bit uncomfortable going to a world without a clearly

Well, while not exactly *dedicated* to these languages, there are fairly
good lexicons for Trokh (Aslan) Vuakedh (the language variant of the Varg\'r

I agree. the extra chapters on Timeline and the Pacification Campaigns

Not if clerks cost about KCr 15 per year apiece. Three man-years mean a 1%
hit rate on targetted investigations returns over 1000% once you sieze and
sell the ship.

Naturally enough, when you actually do bust someone, you can work backwards
to find who they dealt with ... a choice between death or 10 years
following co-operation is a good way to break open the rest of the gang.

This puts pirates in a nasty position. If they do fire at a target, then
there is a risk of accidentally causing casualities, and turning the crime
into big-P piracy. If a target does in fact return fire, then the pirate
must choose between fleeing and escalating things to big-P piracy - and
retaliation against a gunner or captain who does in fact return fire will
be limited by Imperial interest in murder in Imperial space.

Taking on an anti-piracy role will also help get the mercantile interests
of the Imperium on side, which will be important when the Navy and IISS are
battling for budget share (\'Yeah, the Navy is essential, but what have
*they* done for you lately ?\').

Add to this a few percent of Imperial intelligence funds. A quick look at
little black book 6 \'Scouts\' showed about 6 different IISS sub-branches
with roles including intelligence.

Starport officials wont neccessarily know who\'s on detatched duty, who is
on private business and who is part of one of the numerous IISS

Completely agreed. A vanilla type S makes a great \'mail packet\' or ship for

  Presumably the fact that the ship still makes Cr 6000 profit on two weeks
use of a stateroom means that no major change occurred. If so, then the lack
of price changes indicates no great changes in tax structure. Also, the fact
that the game isn\'t meant to be only for underworked accountants could explain

for PC\'s who smuggle stuff past customs (Imperial or otherwise) the taxes are
otherwise subsumed within the trade rules, except for starport fees.

  So is there any reason not to seriously consider RSB as a valid source for
info on the CT/MT 3I, besides the fact that it\'s a TNE book?

  Sort of organized crime with ships? Sounds workable to me, although the
practicality of both piracy and jumping payments both depends on whether
the campaign background has a competent system of governance (with some
allowance for nearness of hostile or uncooperative jurisdictions). It might
be best (even if illusory) for a planetary organization to maintain any
pirate assets at arms length to avoid direct Imperial involvement.

  In any case such groups (current or wanna-be\'s) would be potential
customers for stolen ships (esp. as such may not last terribly long)
and could use them to provide services to "legit" merchants working
in black market goods by shuttling goods to said traders w/o them
having to make jumps that might create questionable indicators on their
"paper-trails" (i.e., flags for possible further research by cops).

  Wouldn\'t economic strength be the best indicator of colonial/dedicated
SD assets rather than IN presence? Presumably both the Imperium and the IN
have sufficient knowledge of their security needs and the art of strategy
to be flexible in achieving their objectives most efficiently (not to say
that security might or might not be number one - but at least the IN doesn\'t
have fellow services with which to bicker [just the battleship vs battlerider
debates :> ]).

Only if they can co-ordinate their research to any degree, and with
communications times being at least a week between systems up to six parsecs
apart, how are you going to tell your colleagues on the other side of the
Imperium of your results before they have already followed a similar path
and got similar results? If you find a major breakthrough then by the time
you\'ve told everyone it\'s out of date.

If such a missile could be built, Baron Charles Pancroft of Centry/Glisten
is eager to get the contract for the low tech stuff. When his father, how
shall I put it, passed away and he got the title (now how did that older
sister die?) he has been hard at work on modernizing Centry. There\'s a
contract prison where all Glisten systems can put their criminals for a
small fee and these prisoners are used as cheap labour in industry.
Currently they work in a plant that build short barrel shotguns with
bootholsters.

The Gadni Type 56m was one of the standard Vilani escorts that bore the brunt
of patrol duties throughout the Interstellar Wars. The design was already
centuries old when the First War broke out in 2110AD (the m series itself was
a minor improvement of the earlier k series) and the design could trace its
origins back to the Conslidation Wars. The design was intended as a low cost
no frills small patrol ship for simple anti-piracy and customs duties. Until
contact with the Terrans the design had served the Vilani well and could be
found throughout the Ziru Sirka. However when faced with the Terrans deep
penetration raids, the design proved to be unsuited for the new tasks asked
of it. The design\'s biggest drawback when facing the Terrans was it lack of
endurance. It simply could not stay on station long enough to prevent the
Terrans from using the many unexploited systems as supply points.

The Type 56m shows many of the features typical of classic Vilani ships. The
ships did not bear individual names after the Terran pattern, rather they
were simply assigned the name Gadni (escort) and a penant number. They use 
a
streamlined disk hull form with little attention to asthetic styling giving a
good volume to surface ratio at a reasonable cost. They only carry sufficent
food and fuel for 672 hours operations (21 standard Vilani "days"), which
while adequate for their general patrol and escort duties, proved inadequate
for dealing with the Terrans long range commerce raiders. They feature a
strong missile armarment with generous magazine capacity, with no secondary
armarment and only limited point defence capacity from the single sandcaster.
They also feature a far higher crew compliment than would be encountered on
a corresponding Terran ship. This is partially due to the Vilani caste
system which prevented any individual from filling more than one post; and
partly by the fact that the Vilani never utilised automation to the same
degree as the Terrans. Several captured ships of this type saw service in the
Terran Confederation Navy, but they never proved popular with their crews.

The Type 56m, Gadni 583309 has the distinction of being the first ship to be
destroyed during the Interstellar Wars. It was her destruction by the
Canberra over Barnard that lead to the First Interstellar War. The Gadni
583309 proved to be no match for close range fire from the Canberra\'s spinal
particle accelerator and was quickly destroyed.

Excellent!  I can certainly recommend it for people who

    * Use Windows 95/NT;

    * Want to create maps;

    * Have sufficient disposable income.

The stuff I contributed included IS Form 21, a MegaTraveller-era world
map grid for Campaign Cartographer 2.

> donate to the disk.

This seems an appropriate time to mention a program I\'ve been working
on:

Gal2CC takes sectors from Jim Vassilakos\' Galactic and creates script
files for Campaign Cartographer 2 which should result in sector maps
approaching the standards of maps published in GDW, DGP and IG products.

Features include:

    * Optional printing of world name (including capitalised pop 9+
      names and red text for capitals), port, bases, gas giant,
      amber/red zones, hex location, allegiance, and trade routes.

    * Automatic generation of base key and subsector catalog.

    * A blank CC2 sector map is included.

Limitations:

    * It currently exists only as a console app, so you need to type
      inconvenient commands like
      
        > Gal2CC -y "1105 (Second Survey)" Classic\\Spinmar\\Spinmar
      
    * Subsector borders cut across hexes with worlds.

    * It makes no attempt to prevent trade routes cutting across other
      details.  This is a tricky one - I may leave this to human
      intervention (moving world names, etc).  This was presumably done
      for the published maps.

    * I don\'t know how reserves are indicated in the data, so can\'t add
      them.

    * It uses standard base descriptions rather than the ones in the
      Galactic sector file.  This is actually quite tricky to solve too,
      since a single base code can indicate multiple bases, and I\'d need
      fuzzy pattern matching to resolve (say) "Naval & Scout Bases" into
      "Navy Base" and "Scout Base".  I may go for a compromise solution.

    * It would be nice to add political borders, but these don\'t seem to
      be represented in the Galactic files.

Future Enhancements:

    * Add an option to produce subsector maps.

    * Add a Windows front end for easy selection of sectors & options.

    * Break subsector borders so they don\'t cut across worlds.

Implementation:

    * It\'s written in fairly portable C, with OS-specific stuff (such as
      I/O) isolated.  This was just for practice - converting files from
      a DOS program to a Win32 app means it didn\'t actually need to be
      portable!  I haven\'t written any C for four years, and it shows.

Getting it:

    * It\'s not quite ready for public release yet so I haven\'t put it on
      my website.  If anyone wants to play with it, I\'ll mail it to you.
      Please specify if you want source code, example scripts, and/or
      example maps included.

Two Warnings:

    * You may need the patch file from the Profantasy site to run the
      scripts properly.  The original release version didn\'t cope with
      font names with spaces (like "Courier New", which I use for hex
      numbers).  If the demo version suffers from this problem, I\'ll
      make it an option to stick with other fonts.

    * The generated scripts are long (full Spinward Marches with all
      details: 10640 lines), even though I\'ve optimised it to eliminate
      redundant commands.  This can be slow to process in CC2 (2.5 mins
      on my P166).

Thank you for your time.

Battleship vs Battlerider? Noooooo!!!!!   <g>

While "flexible" and "efficient" might apply to Imperial and IN security
efforts in the core worlds, I\'d say the Impie track record five wars running
in the Spinward Marches shows a certain lack once you get away from
the Palace. With all those 11000 worlds to back them up, the IN could
never do better than a stalemate, and during the last frontier war it
could be said that the Impies were caught with their pants down.

There\'s a canon reference (Library Data A-M, the essay on Megacorps)
that even in the late 3I there are still enough mercenary actions _in the
core sectors of the Imperium_ to attract the notice of a Megacorp.
Perhaps the security of the entire Imperium is more show than substance.

Inter-service rivalry...

IMTU, the Imperial Navy has a well defined roles that they own (defense
of the realm from outside aggression, internal peacekeeping) and some
roles that they bicker with the IISS over (especially Intelligence). Some
IN Admirals think that the IISS should be a full-time branch of the Navy
(which is pretty much what it becomes in wartime), other Admirals want
no part in the boring re-survey, spacelane marker maintenace, x-boat
support and other tediousness that makes up a large part of IISS ops.
Fast destroyers are sexier than those pokey Donesev-class Survey
Ships any day. This also leads to the most common IN solution being
superior firepower instead of superior information...there\'s even a
canonical example in _The Argon Gambit_, where a couple of IN
intelligence agents scare off some cheap thugs by incinerating them with
FGMP-15\'s. Subtle, hmmmm?  <g>

The IISS Intelligence Agents, of course, see themselves as the dashing
heroes making fools of those bumbling bullies in INI. This will often
lead IISS intelligence agents to try and finesse things instead of calling
in the cavalry, especially if the cavalry would have to be IN. What were
those survival rolls for Scouts again?

Everybody takes prisoners, for questioning if nothing else (keeping them
afterwards is another matter!).  Besides, what if they need to brig one of
their own for a few days, or transport a non-capital offense prisoner?

Bear in mind, having every planet below TL 9 or below population 8 get eaten by
black holes would not significantly damage imperial security -- in fact, it
might improve it.

What is significant about this is that this one appears to be a gas
giant, just under twice Jupiter\'s size, and cold.

Since they determined the planet\'s presence by it\'s effect on it\'s
parent star, not direct visualization, I\'m not sure how they come to
these other conclusions.

Hey, and it\'s only slightly more than jump 2 away.

Which brings me to one point...stars are not evenly distributed on
parsec boundaries (duh) so how do we get to stars that are, forinstance,
15 ly away? 

My wriggling tentacles tell me that the answer may be simultaneously a
solution to both the regularity of spacing, and possibly the flatness of
traveller maps...

Jump 1 will move a ship to the nearest star sized gravity well between 0
and one parsec along the three axes of real space, which gives six
directions in which to move (hence a hex map). If there is no such
gravity well you are precipitated into empty space.

This implies that a \'direction\' as given by a hex actually encompasses a
cubic parsec defined as the space 0,0,0 - 1,1,1 (and various
permutations thereof)

Aside from the gramatical error, (If they are in prison, they
were found guilty and their alibi _wasn\'t_ good enough to get
a not guilty verdict.) I\'m not sure how this addresses the
point.  It the fake records _are_ good enough, then the
clues that the merchant has engaged in criminal activity aren\'t
there and the number of man-years spent on them isn\'t an
issue.  If they aren\'t, then it won\'t take that long to catch
them up.  Sure no scheme to get around records is going to
fool proof.  That only shows that piracy isn\'t so trivial that
one would have to wonder why everyone isn\'t doing it.

Well, you are assuming that every pirate discovered  means a siezed
ship (in the time we are talking abou they can be lost in capture,
lost attacking another ship later on, sold when the captain felt
he had pushed his luck too far, have changed identies, have moved
out of the region or the Imperium.)  Nor do I necessarily think that
1% of all ships that arrive at a port have just engaged in piracy.

However, that is all irrelevant because I don\'t claim that record
checking wouldn\'t happen.  I just don\'t think it is going to
be so reliable as to make piracy impossible or impractical.

Well, we weren\'t talking about gangs.

In effect, you just did, as I am the listowner for it.

The mail software that runs it is a little fiddly occasionally,
so the instructions might not work, but:

send a message to listserv@mail.execnet.com with a body line of 

subscribe travlang

If that doesn\'t work, let me know, either here or at either of my
email addresses, and I\'ll add you manually.

The instructions are also in Freelance Traveller; check out the

The ship is also intended for peacetime patrol/customs duties etc. I\'d imagine

MISS TEEN USA SEIZES CROWN; DECLARES
 HERSELF MISS TEEN USA FOR LIFE 

     DAYTONA BEACH, FL--Moments after being crowned 1998 Miss Teen USA
Sunday, Melissa Kenner, a 17-year-old Joplin, MO, high-school senior, used
her newfound power to purge the Teen USA government and install herself as
supreme leader for life. 

      "All hail Miss Teen USA," proclaimed Kenner, the 1997 Miss Teen
Missouri, minutes after her ascension to the throne. "All hail the
glorious new regime." 

      Employing a six-girl coalition to overthrow the panel of celebrity
judges, Kenner firmly established herself as the supreme power in Teen
USA. "I am the prettiest," she said, declaring herself Miss Teen USA For
Life. "I am also the sweetest." 

      Resplendent in a shimmering white evening gown and bedecked with the
coveted Miss Teen USA tiara, Kenner tearfully waved and smiled at
onlookers as she clutched a bouquet of roses, flanked by her elite,
machine-gun-wielding secret police, the Revlon Guard. Mandatory audience
applause was enforced with the threat of immediate execution. 

      Kenner, who hopes to be a veterinarian one day because "I love
horses so much," employed brutal force in establishing her military-style
junta, seizing control of Teen USA through swift, violent deployment of
the Revlon Guard. The teen beauty credited her success to "a bright smile,
a positive attitude and a willingness to eliminate anyone who stands in my
way." 

      Kenner\'s inner circle includes Miss Congeniality Amanda Rochlin of
Connecticut and Salon Selectives\' "Teen With Style" winner Missy Harris of
Delaware. 

      An 11th-hour attempt to reclaim power by pageant hosts Bob Goen and
Shari Belafonte-Harper backfired, resulting in their on-air execution at
Kenner\'s hands. Celebrity judges critically wounded in the purge include
Home Improvement\'s Zachery Ty Bryan, Mary Kay Cosmetics vice-president
Andrea Iwerks and Superstar Management CEO Albert Sloan. 

      On Monday, Kenner declared martial law across Teen USA and unveiled
the new constitution of her regime. "The law will be dispensed by me,
okay?" she said. "Everybody has to do what I say, when I say, as I see
fit. Only the popular shall determine the fate of the masses." 

      Among the original Miss Teen USA Pageant rules she has already
repealed is the one barring pageant winners from dating during their term.
"I shall date the boys I wish, when I wish," Kenner said. "But I will not
go to bed with them. I am saving myself for the man I marry, because sex
is more special when you wait." 

      Though no formal diplomatic relations have been established between
the Teen USA government and that of the U.S., White House officials have
expressed a willingness to open a line of dialogue with the newly formed
republic. When asked what she would say if she could talk to President
Clinton about one issue, Kenner said, "I would ask him to put more money
into saving the environment, because, when you think about it, this is the
only planet we\'ve got, and we need to make it a better place for our
children to grow up in." 

      Added Kenner: "All enemies of the state will be crushed." 

      Kenner intends to use her $150,000 in cash and prizes to
"consolidate Teen USA\'s power into an unstoppable military juggernaut."
Her favorite movie is Titanic.

Uhh...yeah, that\'s the ticket, they\'re named after Bob Parsec...uh
yeah..Whom I\'ve seen naked!

Doh...make that _fiveish_ parsecs not two and some. For some reason my
brain said 1 parsec = 6.25 ly. when I saw that figure.

Hey maybe _THAT\'S_ why the RoM was so technologically advanced..someone
misprogrammed in the distance of one parsec, and suddenly those terran
Jump 2 and Jump 3 drives magically become enormously more efficient! ;-P

This ship raises mixed emotions in me. On one hand, it\'s a excellent
interpretation on the Vilani design philosophy, as shown by the Imperium
boardgame. On the other hand, as a combat design, it stinks. This isnt to
say it wouldnt be built in large numbers by the First Imperium - they hadnt
faced real opponents in how many years ?

This ship is a total sucker for kinetic-kill missiles, having no response
to them but use of it\'s own limited missile battery. From many years old
memory, the Vilani DD design had a beam factor ... please please please put
a laser turret on this. It has the power spare, even when pulling it\'s full
4.5 gees. Otherwise missiles will be able to close to a range of tens of
kilometers before blossoming, rendering the four gee maneuverability moot.

Offensivly, it\'s a one-trick pony. If it\'s target has solutions to nuke det
lasers (big sand battery, point defense lasers, counter-missiles, multiple
small craft), then all it can do is run.

Opponents also dont need high gee themselves, if they have solutions to
massed missile attack (and with only 18, it isnt going to be that massed,
anyway). A militarised Tracey class, itself carrying a battery of missiles
and maybe a laser turret or two, will be able to play against a Gadni with
a fair chance of success, and will cost a lot less than 1600 megacredits.

I bet they said twice Jupiter\'s *mass*. Gas giants can\'t *get* twice as
big as Jupiter!

Simple. The orbital period is *easily* determined as it\'s also the
"period" of the shifts in the star\'s position. Since you have at least
*some* ide of the star\'s mass this gives you the orbital radius as
well. 

The *size* of the shifts gives you the mass of the planet. 

So now you have the planet\'s mass and orbit. The mass determines the
size (it\'s not massive enough to be a white dwarf, neutron star or
black hole). That also determines whether or not it is generating any
significant amount of heat on its own. 

It\'s *possible* that something that mass is a *big* chunk of rock, but
it\'d be *really*, REALLY unlikely. How do you get that much rock and
metal to accumulate and *not* accumulate a bunch of hydrogen?

A diagram of size versus mass for the typical gas/ice ball is rather
interesting. There\'s a peak a bit above the size of Jupiter, as at that
size the core pressure is enough to create "degenerate" matter (basicly
the "pressure" from the electron shells isn\'t enough to keep the atoms
apart, so you wind up with a sort of "sea" of electrons, with nuclei
wandering around, kept apart by the repulsion due to the positive
charges on their nuclei). So size starts to *decrease* slowly once you
hit this peak. 

Once the pressure gets high enough to sustain a moderate amount of
hydrogen fusion, you\'ve got the lowest mass type M dwarf (or maybe the
new type L they proposed recently). And it gets bigger because the
energy released by the fusion causes the core to expand a little and
the outer layers to expand a *lot*. 

From there, size goes up with mass until you hit the most massive type
O supergiants. These have incredibly short lifespans (Some of the ones
Grandfather may have used as nav beacons are already gone!). 

You can\'t get bigger than these because they drive the fusion reactions
so fast that they are on the verge of exploding. Make them bigger and
they blow up!

I wonder if one of the astronomers on the list has info on the latest
theoretical figures for these sizes. I\'d kinda like to have an
"equation" for the curve.

This is almost as good as the bit in one of John Brunner\'s "Galactic
Consumer Reports" where a 5 year old gets access to a "twin tube
wishing machine" (ie a thought controlled superfactory sort of gizmo)
with defective censor functions and creates an army of nuclear powered
warrior robots to take over.

Picture Calvin with war robots that answer only to *him*. 

One notable detail was the mile long soda fountain he had built. 

He\'s expected to die in a few years from malnutrition, but in the
meantime the planet is off limits (and hell for adults, as well as any
kids he doesn\'t like!).

I\'m not sure what government type that\'d be, but it\'s obviously a red
zone. :-)

Write something.  Start a thread.  We\'ve discussed the effects of various
politcal decisions endlessly, and have had long threads on every aspect of
characterization you can imagine.

What do you want?  Long posts about last Saturday night\'s game?  Those have
been done, and frankly, they leave me flat.  If there is a topic that we
are not covering to your satisfaction, you have to breach the topic.
Despite apperances, the TML is not the exclussive property of Leonard,

it\'s members.

>I wonder why there is so much gearhead stuff on this list and hardly any

Because gearheadism works well in this format.  I\'m one of the biggest
gearheads on this list.  I recently re-did the King Richard for my
Traveller game (I\'ll post it when I\'m happy with the design).  Did my
players here about the cubic volume of the swimming pool?  The 1.8m3 of
waste space in a 7000dt ship?  No, they were trying to keep tabs on the NND
agent whom they thought was contacting the Ine Givar on Strouden.
Gearheading the design meant that my ship worked well as a setting for
adventure; if the characters had need to know how much waste space was
avalible, I could have the Engineer scoff that it was less than 2m3, and be
able to back it up.

And what do you say to the engineer who doesn\'t give a damn about
interstellar politics? For him, the intricacies of jump drives (and all the

Because the gearheads post stuff that they like while the roleplayers are
off worrying about just as improbable interstellar politics.

  The point is that the original poster was obviously interested enough to
post it. If humans waited for somebody else to solve their problems, we\'d
still be living in caves and eating raw meat.

Because players ask hard, inconvenient questions like "What is the connection
between maps in Traveller and reality? The Universe is 3-d, why are the maps
flat? Are there places not on the maps that we can get to and hide?

When the players ask the player playing the astrogator something...he\'s
supposed to say "Because"?

For many players the gearhead stuff on this list _is_ roleplaying information.
We use it to create a background detailed enough for detailed roleplay.

_Why_ did Doug Berry need to know how much waste space there was on the King
Richard, or the exact layout? Because where the **** do you think that agent
was hiding from the players? 

This isn\'t a flame, merely a defense of the list, which, in reality, it hardly
needs.  Piracy have pretty much been beaten into a fading greasy spot, Virus,
and Near-C rocks have\'t shown up on the sensors recently, and it\'s been ages
since we all pretty much agreed that there was no consensus definition of
exactly _what_ a feudal technology was.

Th list waxes and wanes depending on the input from _all_ the people on it.
Sometimes there\'s such a flood of new ideas it\'s nearly impossible to keep up
with them all. Right now, frankly, there\'s a bit of a lull...Andrew\'s cranking
out ships (cool), occasionally some other things are going, but this is
nothing compared to, say, 6-9 months ago there was new stuff popping up every
day...alien races, weird planets, demented weapons ideas, ship designs, ship
deckplans, lively flamefest^H^H^H^H discussions about all manner of things.

But the list is a community, and a community has to be active. This isn\'t a
network TeeVee channel, this is public access. What you see is what the
community puts into it. You can\'t just sit and consume what comes across the
list, you have to contribute, as well.

If there\'s something you want to see, make some of it...it\'ll inspire others
to do more, they\'ll inspire others, and so on. On good days it\'s like that
mousetrap scene from \'Our Friend the Atom\'. On most days, it\'s like a single
match flaring and dimming in the night, accomanied by the sound of hundreds of
hard drives sucking the post into the Black Hole of TML Quality. 

All of my good ideas that I\'ve posted were inspired, directly or indirectly by
other\'s posts. My best stuff (IMNSHO) has come as almost a collaboration with
other people\'s, certainly directly as a result of their ideas, such as the
megamerchant adventure. It\'s on some web site out there, Goeran\'s I think.
(Which sadly, I cannot remember at the moment)  I\'ll dig it up and post it on
my site, too, probably later this weekend. I\'m going to go through the
Traveller CD and recover all that stuff I\'ve lost track of and put it up. The
site is 

http://www.u.arizona.edu/~bjohnson 

Follow the Play links.

Anyway...

Someone (Andy Slack??) posted a very gearheaded design for a huge (really
huge!) ship. In it he included one throwaway line about the Great Megamerchant
Strike. I wrote a 2-3000 word adventure about the PC\'s beeing sent undercover
on board one of these ships (they were a KILOmeter and a half long!) to
investigate and avert another possible strike. Full of detail, tension, a
bunch of NPC\'s, lot\'s of play potential (IMVNSHO ;-). It would _never_ have
happened if that ship hadn\'t been posted...I would never have thought of such
a ship.

But my longwinded point is...if you want to see roleplaying stuff...put it up!
Look at all that gearhead stuff, not as stuff taking up the list and of
interest to gearheads only, but as a springboard to roleplay. 

If every member of this list posted just ONE article _A YEAR_ with new
roleplay stuff, say an NPC, a world description, an adventure seed, an alien,
a fancy gadget, some weird background stuff, like the table of contents for
the special Orrimot issue of \'Starship Collector Monthly\', we would have
_more_ than one good meaty roleplaying post EVERY SINGLE DAY! 

Imagine that! 

Better yet, DO THAT!

tidal action on the planet. This will cause the crust beneath to rebound, like
the Earths did after the Ice Age, when the glaciers retreated, causing more
disruption. Depending on what their social stucture is and what their general

The planet could have the orbit from hell...highly elliptical, which means
they\'ll have to get off the planet before summer comes, or have some _biiiig_

eventually settle into an orbit like Pluto\'s, and stay cold and dark. It all
depends on twhat the relative paths of the star and planet are.

Three Cheers!  I heartily agree. I actually have a healthy interest in
astronomy, but the formula used to derive the radius of a star based on its
mass is not a significant part of a role playing game for me.  An RPG is
about creating a story, and a story is about a character, not a formula. 
It is desirable for the science to be consistent with reality (or
possibility) in a good sci-fi game, book, or film, but when that becomes
more important than the characters, nobody cares anymore.

I\'d like to see more discussion of plot ideas, characters, and other such
stuff on this list. I have very much appreciated the discussions regarding
the workings of the Imperium, and other things that relate to the world in
which the characters (and stories) are based. But there is a LOT of
\'gearhead\' material on the list. Sometimes I feel like I\'m reading
sci.astronomy instead of the TML.

I hope nobody takes offense - as I said, I happen to love astronomy and
science in general, and I appreciate articles like the \'Extrasolar Planet\'
story being posted - I just think that the TML seems to be leaning too far
in one direction. Maybe we could make a conscious effort to level it out.

MHO.

OK, so will people scream & moan if I started dumping details of my campaign 
in construction onto the list?  It\'s gonna be in CT/MT format, mostly, with 
mebbe just a *touch* of Striker (original version, mind you!!) for spice...

Well, they had moved underground at about TL 9, and have been under so long they
have forgotten exactly where that they came from.  The population I have in mind
is small, and live in man made caves.

What chances would you give of the planet settling into the biozone?

In reality? slim to none, and slim just boogied out of town.
For the purposes of your game world? Make it so, Game Master! 

What is the probable best case scenario is that the world will go into an
elliptical orbit giving horribly cold winters, hellishly hot summers, and
raging storms in between...The surface would be barren except for some low
forms of life, bacteria, maybe algae or fungi, and that\'s about all that could
survive the long cold. Annything escaping out of the manmade caves will find
virgin territory to colonize, and under the evolutionary pressures and wide
open system like this planet would quickly(in geologic terms, of course)
spread out and take over...you would have all sorts of weird things
flying/running/swimming/not moving around.

Sure they will, but *please* do it anyway!  Some people are going to
scream & moan no matter what you post. ;->

I\'d love to see details of your cic (campaign in consruction).

I\'d love to see detailed descriptions of systems, planets, equipment,
NPCs, plot ideas, and anything else anybody\'s got.  Heck I\'d love to
see non-detailed descriptions. ;->

Well to non-gearheads all those gearhead designs etc are useful. Back before I 
discovered that I too could be a gearhead (lesser spotted) I relied totally on the 
work of a small group of long suffering gearheads to provide the variety of ships, 
vehicles weapons etc I wanted in my campaigns.

Recently I\'ve been posting a number of ship designs to the list. These are a 
small part of a much larger project which is a sourcebook for the Interstellar 
Wars period (working title Prometheus Rising), for which the main body text 
has just passed the 10,000 words milestone. When I\'ve finished that, I\'m 
planning an updated and expanded write up of the Luriani for Freelance 
Traveller, after that I have to do some more work on transcribing the Judges 
Guild sectors into Galatic.

Anyhow, take a look at the descriptive text that goes with the ship designs I 
post. In every one I try to include some roleplaying information. Thus with the 
Darwin class frigates one gets a history of the class, an adventure hook (the 
Vilani "stealing" her during the Wars and comments on Terran ship design 
practises which helps expand the underlaying Terran Confederation culture. The 
same with the Orca class raiders and the Gadni escorts etc. Good gearhead 
work is also good rpg work.

Well, it\'d take something *highly* unusual to "throw a planet out of
orbit". Especially to do so *without* causing quakes bad enough to make
survival impossible. Getting captured by another star is even *more*
unlikely.

What\'s more likely to happen is for the planet to make a hyperbolic
pass of the star and go on out into space again. 

Capture would require a *second* star or *very* large planet. And you\'d
likely wind up with a *very* eccentric orbit. And it\'d require
sufficiently odd circumstances that the planet is going to have
wandered over a *lot* of parsecs. At around 10,000 years per parsec,
that\'s gonna be 100,000 to 1,000,000 years. Rather more than "several
thousand generations". :-)

Anyway, from the above, you can tell that one problem will be
earthquakes. Both from the tidal forces now being exerted on the
planet, and from the results of shifting crustal stresses due to
melting of ice (including the frozen atmosphere! :-)

There are likely to be some *really* nasty storms until the atmosphere
and hydrosphere reach some sort of equilibrium with the heating from
the star. These shouldn\'t bother the folks in the deep shelters much.

Whilst emailing with Marc about  _Letter of Marque_ (all set for a Monday
mailing as soon as the post-office opens), I happened to ask him about some
other \'lost\' (and oft forgotten) Traveller items - namely, the early-to-mid
80\'s Traveller text-adventures. Things went from there....

Marc has sent me the following "classic" Traveller text-adventures (now
known as "Interactive Fiction" on the net) and various other early
Traveller computer (Apple) software, and he has agreed to allow me to
release all of them into the public domain. 



They are:

_Star Crystal, Episode I - Mertactor: The Volentine Gambit_
	Backcover blurb: 
	"The planet Mertactor/Distract 268 of the Spinward Marches, located at the
fringe of the Imperium. The assignment is simple and profitable - recover a
flashy artifact recently taken from  a representative of DerBonne
Merchants, L.I.C., and return it to Baron Edkos Volentine, a corporate
diirector. You\'ve got two days before your passage home, the Far Trader
"Arax House", is loaded with cargo and ready to leave. There\'s not really
enough time, but it couldn\'t hurt to look around - the Mertactor outback is
supposed to be fairly senic, and you might get lucky. Baron Volentine could
be a useful man to make happy."

_Space I_
	Backcover blurb: 
	"Characters" (In-depth character generator based on Classic Trav.) 
	"First Blood" - Now the game is life-and-death."
	"Defend" - On a small planet in a distant solar system, a character
administrates a colony...Suddenly, it is plundered. Do you evacuate,
mobilize, surrender, or abandon the citizens?"
	"Trader" - Recreate the Horatio Alger myth...exploit the vast emptiness of
the galaxy\'s shipping lines."
	"Explore - On the edge of an ever receding frontier, a lone character
searches out valuable mineral deposits."
	"High Finance - Galaxy-wide investment opportunities are available for the
character who has amassed great wealth during earlier escapades. Your
computer supplies a portfolio. Manipulate to your heart\'s content."

_Space II_
	Partial backcover blurb: (characters created in _Space I_ are used)
	"Psychodelia - A character enters a world where mind-expanding substances
are sold in the \'shooting galleries\' of Psychodelia. Potency? Tolerance?
Physical/mental dependence? Limitations? Hazards? The player must determine
the drug\'s exact nature through experimentation, knowledge of the character
and the clues which the computer provides."	
	"Shaman - A professional religious practitioner is set down in the midst
of an untamed planet. Traveling from one town to the next, the Shaman lures
native converts by administrating magic, sacrifices, calendric rituals,
oraclular prophesy, and fire-and-brimestone sermons."

_Trader_ 
	Partial listing:
	"Trader simulates interstellar trade and commerce in the Traveller
universe using existing Traveller game rules; it especially depends on the
"Merchant Prince" rules for trade contained in Book 7."
 	Features:
	"Sector Gen" (sector data), "Preprocessor" (sector mapping), "Set
Tradeworld" (defines trade routes within sector), "Editor" (aloows editing
of "Ships" and Sectors), "Ships" (data on 24 classic ships), and two
sectors - The Spinward Marches and The Solomani Rim (hardcopy). 

_Beastiary_
	No info. - I\'ve only the disk, but I imagine it generates beasts ;)

_Word Gen_
	Ummm...guess :)



Here is what I am going to *try* and accomplish before I leave for Europe
in  ten days (wouldn\'t be bad, but I leave for _another_ week long trip to
Denver on Monday).

Make \'.dsk\' snapshots of all the above disks.

Key in (as plain ascii text-files) all the documentation in the software
packages.

Write a short text-file indicating that Marc has indeed released them into
the public domain.

Compose a short intro. to Traveller for the uninitiated, with pointers
towards the currently available editions.

Bundle each game/utility and it\'s documentation into its own zip file and
upload the file to the "Interactive Fiction" archive at ftp.gmd.de (look in
the if-archive dir.). It\'s a huge archive, so you\'ll have to search around
a bit. If you don\'t find it, then check the in-coming/if-archive dir. - it
sometimes takes Volker, the archive librarian, several days to move new
uploads into the archive proper.  

*** Apple emulators for nearly all computer platforms are stored at the
archive, so downdload one, install it, load up the .dsk snapshots and away
you go. Also note - several FREE software packages for writing your own
(TRAVELLER) text-adventures are available at the archive...and is my main
reason for asking Marc to do this - exposure of Traveller in as many
formats as possible can\'t hurt and will hopefully fuel interest in our
hobby. So why not help out and  and write your own Trav. IF game? ***

I was able to make a snapshot of "Space I" today - I will try to have it
and all it\'s documentation uploaded to the IF-archive before I leave for
Denver on Monday, and work on the others as I can during the week. If all
else fails, I will continue working on them once I get to Europe. I\'ll post
further notices to the list as I finish and upload each game in the future.

Guess that covers everything.

Happy Gaming,

 Chances are that the Imperium doesn\'t do anything like what we see in the
game, either. The flat hexagonal map is a paper artifact...
 Once holograms take over display technology, you will likely see "true"
position starmaps.

 As for governmental organization, the Zhodani do not use the sector, but do
use the subsector.

their planet\'s previous location in the habitable zone lost in myth and
legend. Even the ruins of the cities on the surface are all but gone.

The planet hurtles through space at a significant fraction of C, so high that
relatavistic effects occur - it has only been thousands of generations to 
make the journey - a journey that, unknown to the cave-dwellers beneath
the surface, is soon to come to an end.

The planet starts _decelerating_ - unknown engines at the planet\'s core
activate, slowing the planet bit by bit...the planet settles into the
habitable zone of  a new star system. The engines shut down, perhaps
for good, thousands of miles below the crust. Frozen atmosphere melts
in a storm of massive proportions. When the pressure is high enough,
an event occurs that panics the cave-dwellers - the ancient gateways
to the surface, their nature and purpose long forgotten, grind themselves
open through the dust and debris of millenia. The bravest of the people
look out at a world with no walls - and soon the spacecraft of the current
inhabitants of this star system start arriving.

Did the engines at the planet\'s core come from the Ancients? Were they
designed and built by the inhabitants themselves, in a bygone age when
they were able to devise such things? You can easily have a technology
that reaches amazing heights, but never stumbles on the secret of
Jump Drive. If they also never stumbled onto Stellar Engineering, they
might need to move their homeworld if they thought a super nova was
coming. Their culture stagnates and recedes in the tunnels beneath during
the long voyage to a new star system - but perhaps those who started
the journey prepared for this eventuality, perhaps a brave or questing soul
amongst the people who completed the journey may find the other secrets
these engineers left behind. It may be all that can save them from the
warships and scientists of the Imperial Navy, who cluster like flies around
this planet of wonders. And full of wonders it must be, for how else could 
it arrive in an Imperial star system from deep space, decelerating with
tens (or hundreds) of G\'s without tearing itself apart?

Just some ideas...

Any chance of getting copies on actual floppies? You see, I\'ve got this
Apple II clone.... :-)

Why bother when I\'ve got a hardware "emulator". :-)

Heck, if I\'d done a bit more leaning on sales critters, I\'d have had
the Trackstar Apple emulator *board* in one of my PC clones!

Well, an interesting alternative is to group the hexes into larger
hexes. It works ok, and will give that "alien" feel when you hand the
stack of hex shaped charts to the players. :-)

A subsector is 80 hexes, a sector is 1280. 

So try a hex 11 hexes across (that is, with 5 "rings" of hexes around
the center hex as your "sub-hexor". That gives 91 hexes. 19 of those
gives you a center "sub-hexor" with two "rings" of "sub-hexors"
surrounding it, for a total of 1729 hexes. This "hexor" should fit on a
piece of hex paper with 24 "rings" around the center hex (for a
"diameter" of 49 hexes).

If you use realistic thrust rules (acceleration is proportional to

                *Empty ships run fast, loaded ships run slow*

In fact a 200DT TL12 free trader, with no cargo, can accelerate about
twice as fast as one that is fully loaded (at least under FFS2). And the
difference increases with TL.

For a dedicated passenger vessel, load doesn\'t make as much difference.
Only around a 25% acceleration increase when empty.

A large dedicated cargo vessel can accelerate more than four times as
fast with no cargo than it can when loaded.

As the main problem of boarding ships is matching vectors, this does
give an edge to an empty ship trying to catch a full one. It also gives
a ship being chased the option of jettisoning cargo to prolong the
chase. [And the chasing ship had better beware of accelerating into a
cargo container.]

Using realistic thrust a 4G Corsair is just a 2G (heavily) armed trader
with an empty hold :)

And though I still don\'t believe a piracy CAREER makes sense, this does
at least add another argument to try and justify the canon references.

This should make an excellent radiator. Does this have any basis in
reality?

If so then:

Take a reel of very high temperature superconducting ribbon and attach
it to the hot end of a heat pump (the hotter the better, IIRC heat
radiates with the 4th power of the temperature). Unwind the ribbon into
space to radiate.  Automatically reel it in and feed it out to adjust
radiated heat as required. This would likely give one hell of a ship
signature. 

In order to minimise the heat you have to radiate, it would make sense
to avoid taking on heat from the local star(s). So why not install a
star-shade(tm).  This is just a *large* disc of Reflec on an insulated
stick that you point so as to shade you from the radiation from the
local star [picture a ship holding a large umbrella :) ]. The
majority(?) of the gamma radiation hitting the disc is reflected, the
remainder is absorbed and re-emitted in random directions. Therefore
only a tiny amount of the stars radiation reaches you, by re-emission or
convection down the stick. This would also greatly reduce stellar
interference with your sensors, increasing their range and sensitivity.
Makes EVA much safer too.

Combine the two and radiate your waste heat from the underside of the
star-shade. Then you have a practical, if very unlikely looking,
radiation shield and radiator. And of course a large blind-spot.

Of course you can\'t use either of these in atmosphere. But heat is easy
to dump when you can lose it by convection.

By the way how do you radiate waste heat in Jump Space when surrounded
by a bubble of Hydrogen? Wouldn\'t the Hydrogen reach plasma
temperatures, and melt the hull, if used to dump waste heat for seven
days? Also heating it would excite the gas and cause it to disperse, no?

<sarcasm>
You don\'t.  Everyone just sits back and discusses interstellar politics and
don\'t worry about such minutia.

OR

All the waste heat is expelled at the instant of Jump just like the jump
fuel.
</sarcasm>

Seriously though, starships would seem to spend most of their time in jump
space (a week compared to days).  On the upside, you don\'t need nearly as
much power.  Maneuver drives and weapons are probably off line.  You\'ll
still need a computer and life support and maybe sensors if they work in
your traveller jumpspace.  In any case, this cuts the waste heat way down.
Of course we could hypothesize about the nature of the Lanthanum.  Its got a
very high melting point IIRC, which could be utilized in jumpspace for heat
transfer.

Bryan, I\'ll send you the current version as soon as I\'ve written some
instructions - consider this a beta-test version.  If you could try it
out, that would be really useful.  [Like I said, I wasn\'t planning on
releasing it yet, but this seems like too good an opportunity to miss.]

Any other potential beta-testers out there?

Here\'s the version I have--I rearranged it a bit and converted it to
Word.

Becoming an Evil Overlord

It seems to be a good career choice. It pays well, there are all
sorts of perks and you can set your own hours. However, every Evil
Overlord I\'ve heard about invariably gets overthrown and destroyed in
the end.  I\'ve noticed that no matter whether they are barbarian
lords, deranged wizards, mad scientists, loathsome engineers or alien
invaders, they always seem to make the same basic mistakes every
single time. With that in mind, allow me to present...

Things I\'d Do If I Ever Became An Evil Overlord

 *  My Legions of Terror will have helmets with clear Plexiglas
visors, not face-concealing ones that can hide the enemy.
 *  My ventilation ducts will be too small to crawl through.
 *  My noble half-brother whose throne I usurped will be killed, not
kept imprisoned in a forgotten cell of my dungeon.
 *  Shooting is not too good for my enemies and should be done ASAP.
 *  The artifact which is the source of my power will not be kept on
the Mountain of Despair beyond the River of Fire guarded by the
Dragons of Eternity. It will be in my safe-deposit box. The same
applies to the object which is my one weakness.
 *  I will not gloat over my enemies\' predicament before killing
them.
 *  When I\'ve captured my adversary and he says, "Look, before you
kill me, will you at least tell me what this is all about?" I\'ll say
"No" and shoot him. No, on second thought I\'ll shoot him then say
"No."
 *  After I kidnap the beautiful princess, we will be married
immediately in a quiet civil ceremony, not a lavish spectacle in
three weeks\' time during which the final phase of my master plan will
be carried out.
 *  I will not include a self-destruct mechanism unless absolutely
necessary. If it is necessary, it will not be a large red button
labeled "Danger: Do Not Push". The big red button marked "Do Not
Push" will instead trigger a spray of bullets on anyone stupid enough
to disregard it. Similarly, the ON/OFF switch will not clearly be
labeled as such.
 *  I will not interrogate my enemies in the inner sanctum-a small
hotel well outside my borders will work just as well.
 *  I will be secure in my superiority. Therefore, I will feel no
need to prove it by leaving clues in the form of riddles or leaving
my weaker enemies alive to show they pose no threat.
 *  One of my advisors will be an average five-year-old child. Any
flaws in my plan that he is able to spot will be corrected before
implementation.
 *  All slain enemies will be cremated, or at least have several
rounds of ammunition emptied into them, not left for dead at the
bottom of the cliff.
 *  The announcement of their deaths, as well as any accompanying
celebration, will be deferred until after the aforementioned
disposal.
 *  The hero is not entitled to a last kiss, a last cigarette, or any
other form of last request.
 *  I will never employ any device with a digital countdown. If I
find that such a device is absolutely unavoidable, I will set it to
activate when the counter reaches 117 and the hero is just putting
his plan into operation.
 *  I will never utter the sentence "But before I kill you, there\'s
just one thing I want to know."
 *  When I employ people as advisors, I will occasionally listen to
their advice.
 *  I will not have a son. Although his laughably under-planned
attempt to usurp power would easily fail, it would provide a fatal
distraction at a crucial point in time.
 *  I will not have a daughter. She would be as beautiful as she was
evil, but one look at the hero\'s rugged countenance and she\'d betray
her own father.
 *  Despite its proven stress-relieving effect, I will not indulge in
maniacal laughter. When so occupied, it\'s too easy to miss unexpected
developments that a more attentive individual could adjust to
accordingly.
 *  I will hire a talented fashion designer to create original
uniforms for my Legions of Terror, as opposed to some cheap
knock-offs that make them look like Nazi storm troopers, Roman foot
soldiers, or savage Mongol hordes. All were eventually defeated and I
want my troops to have a more positive mind-set.
 *  No matter how tempted I am with the prospect of unlimited power,
I will not consume any energy field bigger than my head.
 *  I will keep a special cache of low-tech weapons and train my
troops in their use. That way-even if the heroes manage to neutralize
my power generator and/or render the standard-issue energy weapons
useless-my troops will not be overrun by a handful of savages armed
with spears and rocks.
 *  I will maintain a realistic assessment of my strengths and
weaknesses.  Even though this takes some of the fun out of the job,
at least I will never utter the line "No, this cannot be! I AM
INVINCIBLE!!!" (After that, death is usually instantaneous.)
 *  No matter how well it would perform, I will never construct any
sort of machinery which is  completely indestructible except for one
small and virtually inaccessible vulnerable spot.
 *  No matter how attractive certain members of the rebellion are,
there is probably someone just as attractive who is not desperate to
kill me.
 *  Therefore, I will think twice before ordering a prisoner sent to
my bed chamber.
 *  I will never build only one of anything important. All important
systems will have redundant control panels and power supplies. For
the same reason I will always carry at least two fully loaded weapons
at all times.
 *  My pet monster will be kept in a secure cage from which it cannot
escape and into which I could not accidentally stumble.
 *  I will dress in bright and cheery colors, and so throw my enemies
into confusion.
 *  All bumbling conjurers, clumsy squires, no-talent bards, and
cowardly thieves in the land will be pre-emptively put to death. My
foes will surely give up and abandon their quest if they  have no
source of comic relief.
 *  All naive, busty tavern wenches in my realm will be replaced with
surly, world-weary waitresses who will provide no unexpected
reinforcement and/or romantic subplot for the hero or his sidekick.
 *  I will not fly into a rage and kill a messenger who brings me bad
news just to illustrate how evil I really am. Good messengers are
hard to come by.
 *  I won\'t require high-ranking female members of my organization to
wear a stainless-steel bustier. Morale is better with a more casual
dress-code. Similarly, outfits made entirely from black leather will
be reserved for formal occasions.
 *  I will not turn into a snake. It never helps.
 *  I will not grow a goatee. In the old days they made you look
diabolic. Now they just make you look like a disaffected member of
Generation X.
 *  I will not imprison members of the same party in the same cell
block, let alone the same cell. If they are important prisoners, I
will keep the only key to the cell door on my person instead of
handing out copies to every bottom-rung guard in the prison.
 *  If my trusted lieutenant tells me my Legions of Terror are losing
a battle, I will believe him. After all, he\'s my trusted lieutenant.
 *  If an enemy I have just killed has a younger sibling or offspring
anywhere, I will find them and have them killed immediately, instead
of waiting for them to grow up harboring feelings of vengeance
towards me in my old age.
 *  If I absolutely must ride into battle, I will certainly not ride
at the forefront of my Legions of Terror, nor will I seek out the
attacking leader among his army.
 *  I will be neither chivalrous nor sporting. If I have an
unstoppable superweapon, I will use it as early and as often as
possible instead of keeping it in reserve.
 *  Once my power is secure, I will destroy all those pesky
time-travel devices.
 *  When I capture the hero, I will make sure I also get his dog,
monkey, ferret, or whatever sickeningly cute little animal capable of
untying ropes and filching keys happens to follow him around.
 *  I will maintain a healthy amount of skepticism when I capture the
beautiful rebel and she claims she is attracted to my power and good
looks and will gladly betray her companions if I just let her in on
my plans.
 *  I will only employ bounty hunters who work for money. Those who
work for the pleasure of the hunt tend to do dumb things like even
the odds to give the other guy a sporting chance.
 *  I will make sure I have a clear understanding of who is
responsible for what in my organization. For example, if my general
screws up I will not draw my weapon, point it at him, say "And here
is the price for failure," then suddenly turn and kill some random
underling.
 *  If an advisor says to me "My liege, he is but one man. What can
one man possibly do?", I will reply "This." and kill the advisor.
 *  If I learn that a callow youth has begun a quest to destroy me, I
will slay him while he is still a callow youth instead of waiting for
him to mature.
 *  I will treat any beast which I control through magic or
technology with respect and kindness. Thus if the control is ever
broken, it will not immediately come after me for revenge.
 *  If I learn the whereabouts of the one artifact which can destroy
me, I will not send all my troops out to seize it.  Instead I will
send them out to seize something else and quietly put a Want-Ad in
the local paper.
 *  My main computers will have their own special operating system
that will be completely incompatible with standard IBM and Macintosh
Powerbooks.
 *  If one of my dungeon guards begins expressing concern over the
conditions in the beautiful princess\' cell, I will immediately
transfer him to a less people-oriented position.
 *  I will hire a team of board-certified architects and surveyors to
examine my castle and inform me of any secret passages and abandoned
tunnels that I might not know about.
 *  If the beautiful princess that I capture says "I\'ll never marry
you!  Never, do you hear me, NEVER!!!", I will say "Oh well," and
kill her.
 *  I will not strike a bargain with a demonic being then attempt to
double-cross it simply because I feel like being contrary.
 *  The deformed mutants and odd-ball psychotics will have their
place in my Legions of Terror. However before I send them out on
important covert missions that require tact and subtlety, I will
first see if there is anyone else equally qualified who would attract
less attention.
 *  My Legions of Terror will be trained in basic marksmanship. Any
who cannot learn to hit a man-sized target at 10 meters will be used
for target practice.
 *  Before employing any captured artifacts or machinery, I will
carefully read the owner\'s manual.
 *  If it becomes necessary to escape, I will never stop to pose
dramatically and toss off a one-liner.
 *  I will never build a sentient computer smarter than I am.
 *  My five-year-old child advisor will also be asked to decipher any
code I am thinking of using. If he breaks the code in under 30
seconds, it will not  be used. Note: this also applies to passwords.
 *  If my advisors ask "Why are you risking everything on such a mad
scheme?",  I will not proceed until I have a response that satisfies
them.
 *  I will design fortress hallways with no alcoves or protruding
structural supports which intruders could use for cover in a
firefight.
 *  Bulk trash will be disposed of in incinerators, not compactors.
And they will be kept hot, with none of that nonsense about flames
going through accessible tunnels at predictable intervals-the flames
will be constant!
 *  I will see a competent psychiatrist and get cured of all
extremely unusual phobias and bizarre compulsive habits which could
prove to be a disadvantage.
 *  If I must have computer systems with publicly available
terminals, the maps they display of my complex will have a room
clearly marked as the Main  Control Room. That room will be the
Execution Chamber. The actual main  control room will be marked as
Sewage Overflow Containment.
 *  My security keypad will actually be a fingerprint scanner. Anyone
who  watches someone press a  sequence of buttons or dusts the pad
for fingerprints then subsequently tries to enter by repeating that
sequence will trigger the death ray.
 *  No matter how many shorts we have in the system, my guards will
be instructed to treat every surveillance camera malfunction as a
full-scale emergency.
 *  I will spare someone who saved my life sometime in the past. This
is only reasonable as it encourages others to do so. However, the
offer is good one time only. If they want me to spare them again,
they\'d better save my life again.
 *  All midwives will be banned from the realm. All babies will be
delivered at state-approved hospitals. Orphans will be placed in
foster-homes, not abandoned in the woods to be raised by creatures of
the wild.
 *  When my guards split up to search for intruders, they will always
travel in groups of at least two. They will be trained so that if one
of them disappears mysteriously while on patrol, the other will
immediately  initiate an alert and call for backup, instead of
quizzically peering around a corner.
 *  If I decide to test a lieutenant\'s loyalty and see if he/she
should be made a trusted lieutenant, I will have a crack squad of
marksmen standing by in case the answer is no.
 *  If all the heroes are standing together around a strange device
and begin to taunt me, I will pull out a conventional weapon instead
of using my unstoppable super weapon on them.
 *  I will not agree to let the heroes go free if they win a rigged
contest, even though my advisors assure me it is impossible for them
to win.
 *  When I create a multimedia presentation of my plan designed so
that my five-year-old advisor can easily understand the details, I
will not label the disk "Project Overlord" and leave it lying on top
of my desk.
 *  I will instruct my Legions of Terror to attack the hero en masse,
instead of standing around waiting while members break off and attack
one or two at a time.
 *  If the hero runs up to my roof, I will not run up after him and
struggle with him in an attempt to push him over the edge. I will
also not engage him at the edge of a cliff. (In the middle of a
rope-bridge over a river of molten lava is not even worth
considering.)
 *  If I have a fit of temporary insanity and decide to give the hero
the chance to reject a job as my trusted lieutenant, I will retain
enough sanity to wait until my current trusted lieutenant is out of
earshot before making the offer.
 *  I will not tell my Legions of Terror "And he must be taken
alive!" The command will be "And try to take him alive-unless he
resists."
 *  If my doomsday device happens to come with a reverse switch, as
soon as it has been employed it will be melted down and made into
limited-edition commemorative coins.
 *  If my weakest troops fail to eliminate a hero, I will send out my
best troops instead of wasting time with progressively stronger ones
as he gets closer and closer to my fortress.
 *  If I am fighting with the hero atop a moving platform, have
disarmed him, and am about to finish him off and he glances behind me
and drops flat, I too will drop flat instead of quizzically turning
around to find out what he saw.
 *  I will not shoot at any of my enemies if they are standing in
front of the crucial support beam to a heavy, dangerous, unbalanced
structure.
 *  If I\'m eating dinner with the hero, put poison in his goblet,
then have to leave the table for any reason, I will order new drinks
for both of us instead of trying to decide whether or not to switch
with him.
 *  I will not have captives of one sex guarded by members of the
opposite sex.
 *  I will not use any plan in which the final step is horribly
complicated, e.g. "Align the 12 Stones of Power on the sacred altar
then activate the medallion at the moment of total eclipse." Instead
it will be more along the lines of "Push the button."
 *  I will make sure that my doomsday device is up to code and
properly grounded.
 *  My vats of hazardous chemicals will be covered when not in use.
Also, I will not construct walkways above them.
 *  If a group of henchmen fail miserably at a task, I will not
berate them for incompetence then send the same group out to try the
task again.

disband my  legions and relax my guard because I believe whoever

is facing away from the door.
 *  I will not ignore the messenger that stumbles in exhausted and
obviously agitated until my personal grooming or current
entertainment is finished. It might actually be important.
 *  If I ever talk to the hero on the phone, I will not taunt him.
Instead I will say this his dogged perseverance has given me new
insight on the futility of my evil ways and that if he leaves me
alone for a few months of quiet contemplation I will likely return to
the path of righteousness. (Heroes are incredibly gullible in this
regard.)
 *  If I decide to hold a double execution of the hero and an
underling who failed or betrayed me, I will see to it that the hero
is scheduled to go first.
 *  When arresting prisoners, my guards will not allow them to stop
and grab a useless trinket of purely sentimental value.
 *  My dungeon will have its own qualified medical staff complete
with bodyguards. That way if a prisoner becomes sick and his cellmate
tells the guard it\'s an emergency, the guard will fetch a trauma team
instead of opening up the cell for a look.
 *  My door mechanisms will be designed so that blasting the control
panel on the outside seals the door and blasting the control panel on
the inside opens the door, not vice versa.
 *  My dungeon cells will not be furnished with objects that contain
reflective surfaces or anything that can be unraveled.
 *  If an attractive young couple enters my realm, I will carefully
monitor their activities. If I find they are happy and affectionate,
I will ignore them. However if circumstance have forced them together
against their will and they spend all their time bickering and
criticizing each other except during the intermittent occasions when
they are saving each others\' lives at which point there are hints of
sexual tension, I will immediately order their execution.
 *  Any data file of crucial importance will be padded to at least
1.45Mb in size so that it won\'t conveniently fit on a single
diskette.
 *  When I send underlings to capture the heroes I will ensure that
they have weapons and armor sufficient to overcome the armament the
heroes employ. I will be sure to send at least three underlings for
every hero, and instruct them to retreat and not fight to the last
man if suddenly outmatched by a Secret Weapon.
 *  I will instruct underlings to report to me if they see their
commanding officer disobeying orders, letting prisoners go, or
repeating like an echo whatever a hero says.
 *  If the hero is not in his home/office/clubhouse when my minions
break in, they are to wait there for his return and not make obvious
signs of their presence.
 *  I will only kill underlings who lie to me and hide their
failures. Underlings who admit their failures will be reassigned to
less demanding duties.
 *  I will not repeat pet phrases or rhymes from my violent younger
days to any prisoners or visitors, in case this is the only memory
said persons have of their parents\' killer.
 *  Any critical mechanism such as self-destruct, life support, or
protective force fields will be controlled through multiple keyed
interlocks and not a simple on/off switch.
 *  I will construct my secret base of fire resistant materials and

I fail to understand why you\'re suddenly talking about the ship trying not
to leave behind enough information to follow. If you think back, you\'ll
recall that we were talking about a ship "swimming with the fishes", doing
normal merchant operations while waiting for an opportune target. Can you
explain how a ship can perform normal merchant operations without leaving
a trail of people that has done business with them? Even without assuming
that the Imperium taxes passengers and freight (Obviously, if it does, any
ship involved in normal merchant operations will leave a paper (electron)
trail that goes up to Subsector level at the very least. (In which case we\'re
propably talking man-hours to follow the track). But just taking on a
passenger or delivering a ton of freight will leave behind witnesses).

You get a piracy report. The minimum information you have on the pirate
will depend on whether the pirate steals the ship or not and several 
other factors, but at the very least you can jump in a couple of scouts
a suitable number of light-weeks away and get some idea of its size
(If the victim got off a radio broadcast, or if the pirate only takes the
cargo) you have a heck of a lot more than that, though it is canonical
that emission signatures can be faked). At the very least you\'ll have a
pretty good idea about its size. You run a check on all ships of the
appropiate size range that could physically have been in that system at
that time. Just comparing starport logs of departure and arrival dates
will eliminate most candidates. Whether you need to send some men round to
collect those records or whether they are automatically sent to the
subsector capital is a trifling matter, a few hundreds of thousand credits
at most. Class E starports may not keep such logs, but OTOH they get
fewer visiting starships, so it would be easier for locals to remember
those they did get. Anyway, once you\'ve eliminated most ships, you send out
investigators (or Imperial starships) to check the rest. The only chance the
pirate has is to run far and fast. He certainly won\'t be able to go back to
running with the fish.

What removed them? They\'d be buried under quite a bit of frozen

If it\'s moving *that* fast (better than .6 c), it has to have come from
outside the galaxy (or at least from the other side :-). The galaxy is
only a few hundred thousand parsecs across!

The speed, trip time, and trip distance are are inter-related. Pick any
two and the value of the third is determined by them.

This isn\'t possible in large installations. However, I\'m told that the
military solves this by lining them with nasty knife-like blades. These
don\'t interfere with the airflow much, but make using the ducts for
access not worth the trouble. They also help keep the flow turbulent,
which reduces the deposition of dust. :-)

Make that:

The hydrogen isn\'t going to absorb much of the radiated heat. It\'s
pretty transparent at those frequencies.

But you\'ve brought up an important limit on the "appearance" of jump
space. If it *doesn\'t* appear to be as "black" as normal space, then
the radiators don\'t work as well. So that kills all the "strange
shifting colors" descriptions. If the colors are bright enough to see,
they\'ll be *heating* the ship. 

I go with the "jump space is just featureless black" and if anything
gets too far from the hull, it doesn\'t come back. That includes
photons. So the "effective temperature" of jump space is absolute zero.
Making your radiators somewhat *more* efficient than in normal space
(where the parts of the sky that don\'t contain stars are at an
effective temp of 3 Kelvin).

Fits into 50 dton bay with a little to spare. As a spinal weapon, cost
falls by MCr 31.4 to MCr 33.35 due to the use of a cheaper non-trainable
array.

The weapon is of sufficient range to reach out and touch someone to just
under 2 light seconds range. Outside that range, evasion tends to dominate
in any case.

The weapon is designed as a dual-purpose long range anti-missile platform,
combined with substantial anti-ship capability (forcing missiles to adopt
evasive courses at or around 100 kkm makes them more vulnerable to
counter-missile fire). I\'d say it makes an excellent main gun for a frigate
or a system defense boat, and would see good service in destroyers and up
as a secondary system, backing up a spinal mount.

I was using irony.

The point is how does the pirate know if they have spent enough on covering
their paper trail ?

Spend too little on forgery and/or bribery and you risk capture.

Spend too much and you become unprofitable - and their is little point on
risking your life month in month out to keep your corrupt buddies rich.

One nice thing about such \'soft kills\' is you get to quietly arrest the
crew of the ship, and then the cops are in an excellent position to extract
co-operation from those people. Beats duking it out in deep space.

We are talking about a pirate, a base and a fence. Catch one and your odds
on getting the other two are decent. If they are all on one ship, then it\'s
paper trail will be even broader, because capturing cargo in one subsector
and selling ti somewhere else is even harder.

    'body' => 'As part of my long-term trade project, I\'m looking at what value high-skill
crew can add to various ship systems.

First of all, combat positions. This depends a lot on what combat system
you use, and how often they expect to see combat. Under High Guard, highly
skilled crew (greater than 3) were a big influence - (1/2 * Ship Tactics)
- -1 could proxy for your computer, so Ship Tactics-3 was the equivalent of a
mod 2 computer. Seeing how a mod2 computer cost about MCr 6 more than a
mod-1, this meant a skilled captain was worth MCr 6. Given standard
financing, a ship tac-3 captain was thus worth KCr 24 per month.

Similarly, a skilled gunner was worth +1 factor for weapons they fired. A
triple TL 11+ sandcaster turret was Fac-4 - getting fac 5 required 2
turrets, so if a skilled gunner can get this effect they either saved you
MCr 0.75 or freed up a hardpoint for offensive weapons.

Pilot or Ships Boat skill could add to your agility, thus increasing your
ships\' effective combat maneuverability. Given the cost of t-plates, this
is also substantial.

I\'m not sure what effect Engineers should have in combat - letting highly
skilled engo\'s increase power output (a la Orions in Star Fleet Battles) is
too extreme. Perhaps the skill of an engineer should be the main
determinant on whether or not you can jump out of combat damaged.

Going to the civilian positions, this is where highly skilled positions
dominate.

Broker skill is worth 2.5% of speculative cargo value per level. Given that
a fully loaded Far Trader has about 80 dtons of cargo, if this cargo is
worth KCr 6 per dton, then thats ummm KCr 48 per trip. Higher capacity
traders would increase this in proportion to their cargo bays. I\'d say an
even split of profits between the Purser and the rest of the crew sounds
about right myself *grin*

Trader skill is harder to quantify, but I\'d say it should be worth about
the same as Broker. In a previous post I suggested successful use of Trader
skill should allow goods to ignore source/market TL differentials,
representing non-TL dependant luxury goods (a hand-embroidered rug may not
have a market price related to how well it keeps you warm at night). Having
a cargo to take off a lo-tech world, even if it\'s a 50/50 proposition to
make money makes a big difference to profitibility.

Legal skill is important to pass \'routine inspections\' at starports and in
deep space, but I\'m not sure what thats worth. If untying red tape takes a
couple of days, then repeated failures could cut the amount of time a ship
is making money substantially. If you fail a routine inspection really
really badly, then concequences could go from bad to very bad to
unbelievably bad.

The \'minor\' economic skills essentially seem to allow a trader to operate
in more marginal markets - liason, admin, steward and streetwise increase
the projecter amount of cargos and passengers available, which helps make
marginal markets profitable, but they are unlikely to make an unprofitable
route profitable as Broker and/or Trader can.

is a low orbit-capable 9.8 m3 air/raft, built with a mixture of TL8 and 9
components. It is designed to fit into one displacement ton of cargo space.
Two basic models exist, one powered by TL9 batteries for 2 hours operation,
and the other with a TL7 alcohol-burning power plant with 17 hours fuel.
The first is more useful in worlds without oxygen atmospheres, while the
alcohol-burning power plant can find fuel in almost any frontier or lo-tech
world. Both models feature full atmospheric sealing, and a life support
system allowing 12 hours operations.

The fast subsonic airframe carries only a pilot, and is capable of a speed
of 680 km per hour, and can achieve that speed if unloaded. It\'s true value
on the frontier is it\'s impressive external cargo capacity - it has a sling
arrangement for external cargos, and is capable of carrying 12 ton of
external cargo at 334 kmh, or 44 ton of external cargo at 136 kmh.

It\'s electronic suite is simple, consisting of a TL8 avionics and
navigation aids, and a TL9 image enhancement scope for operations in bad
visibility conditions, plus a 500 km range radio tranciever and two TL8
flight computers to assist the pilot.

The total unit costs KCr 42 (KCr 40 for the alcohol-fueled version), with
KCr 35 of that cost being with TL8 components and the remainder at TL9 (KCr
25 is the flight aids and avionics which truly dashing Scout types can
omit). A TL8 solar array unit for recharging the battery on a type 1 model
takes up 14m3, masses 28 t and costs KCr 84 in TL8 credits, and can
recharge the unit in 29 hours of standard sunlight. Other options include
an alcohol or hydrocarbon electric generator, or mains electricity on more
developed worlds.

Many IISS retirees invest their mustering-out money in one of these units,
then arrange to be mustered out on a suitable world and set up a
surface-to-surface or even surface-to-orbit shuttle service. It should be
noted that whilst the 4.5mm composite laminate shell stops many small arms,
operation in combat areas is not advised.

I believe this craft should be able to use the Helicopter external sling
rule on p24 of FFS2. At KCr 45 or so, I believe these things should be all
over the Imperium - they provide better lift capability than a Chinook
cargo helicopter, are capable of making orbit with a brave enough pilot and
can be packed into 1 dton of cargo space. Hell, this thing should replace a
gun on the Scout mustering out table *grin* Oh, and I calculate it at three
maintainence points, so it should be OK for years before needing a look at
with an electronics and a mechanical toolkit. Incidentally, TL8 worlds have
a per capita income of KC8 a year according to Striker, so one of these
things should cost around 7 years annual salary, or about $140 000 in
modern terms.

You could probably build a bigger version, with internal cargo and
passenger capability, at not much increase in cost or reduction in
performance, but I kept the size to something that could be palletised into
1dton of cargo space.

in tempurature and light. I\'ve been in several underground facilitites,
mines, office complex\'es, storage facilities, Norad, etc. and I\'ve noticed
that all of the light levels are roughly identical and the tempuratures the
same. This would probably read as the population over a thousand or so
generations (30,000+ human years) would have gotten very adapted to a single
standard of enviroment. Combine this adaption with the various orbits and
planetary instability commented on in some of the posts to the list and I
think that these people would have a real time ahead.

2. Is this scenario for your PC\'s to be members of the population dealing
with this? or are they going to be encountering this planet?

Well the canon Imperium does.  Holograms aren\'t strictly necessary.  Jim V (of

Why not?  While most CT/MT rules specific items mean precisely dirt to me
other than for idea mining, that in itself can be most useful.  Especially
with none of the versions of Traveller in current print.  

My 2 Cr on the whole technobabble detail thing is that certain things (J-drive
the one that comes immediately to mind) by necessity must be kept *officially*
vague, though house rules can go wherever they want (as though they could be
stopped anyways).  This especially holds true in the mixed game/rules
mechanics company that is the tml (until an official version returns to print,
at least).

In my upcoming work (unofficial) on the Interstellar Wars the Terran 
Confederation uses the Quadrant. Each quadrant covers roughly four Imperial 
aubsectors (its actually 16 x 16 parsecs, as against 16 x 20). The Quadrant 
remained the standard unit until the Terran Confederation was replaced by the 
Rule of Man. The Rule of Man adopted the Vilani Sector for its mapping 
conventions.

Well, I set the game in another galaxy.  Or use the pat answer of blaming it on

It doesn\'t even take all that much confinement...a friend of mine pulled
Peace Corps duty in Jamaica...average temp something like 76F +/- maybe
5 degrees. They had a \'cold wave\' one winter, temperature got down to
the low 60\'s. Everyone was running around in coats and sweaters, and
even he was cold (and he grew up in Prescott, Arizona..north country,

LBB-8 Merchant Prince mentions 6 of the remaing 8, naming 2 of them:

Star Patterns Trading: one of five Hiver megacorps, and is the major Hiver 
trader with the Imperium. It is a multi-function megacorp, vertically oriented 
- - it owns and operates companies which preform all necessary activities, from 
collecting the raw materials to manufacturing the goods to transporting and 
merchandising them.
   Home Port: Erest
   Territory: The Hive Federation

Priantqlovr Drafr ("Military Star Shipping"): Zhodani megacorp that dominates 
transport and shipping within the border province of Iadr Nsobl.  Owned by a 
Zhodani noble, enjoys a permanent military subsidy, and operates as a reseve 
arm of the Navy.
   Home Port: Chronor
   Territory: Trailing sectors of Zhodani Consulate

It is noted that Vargr megacorps do not exist.

No.  You can have materials with immense thermal conductivity, but it has

Reflective shields like that have a long history of being used in space flight.
I suspect that the standard hull coatings (which can change color) can probably
reduce absorbed heat by 80-90% just by shifting color to white, though.  Also,
the major heat sources on Traveller ships tend to be things other than absorbed
energy.
Incidentally, reducing heat absorbtion this way increases your visual signature
by +1 (going from 99% black to 80-90% white).

You have to assume that J-space is capable of acting as a heat sink.

This has some problems. For one, there won\'t be any atmosphere left. So
the surface will be a vacuum, even  after it settles into the new
orbit. Second, to survive at all, they have to be more than 10 AU out
when the core collapses. Otherwise, the neutrino flux is lethal. And if
they are *that* far out, the blast damage won\'t be as bad.

Also, any habitable world will become *uninhabitable* long before the
star goes supernova. That\'s because the star leaves the main sequence
and becomes a red giant, and in the process expands until it fills the
former habitable zone, but there\'s not enough to for life to start (or
adapt) on the planets in the *new* habitable zone.

Well, this gives a somewhat more plausible explanation than the
supernova. They can be fleeing a core explosion, or a galactic
collision or some other such messy effect. 

Then the missing cities can be battle damage due to the various worlds
fighting over who gets to put their people on the \'world ship\'.

This even explains why they didn\'t use jump drive. They may have known
about it, but it\'s pretty much *useless for intergalactic travel. So
they had to develop a realspace drive capable of moving a planet.

BTW, I\'m *not* going to ask what they are using for energy, as the
energy requirements for going from near c to a stable orbit are on the
order of what you\'d get by converting the *entire* planet to energy.

Bilante Disen: Mercht/9 1st_Ofc 79B978 age 60 Cr7100 
astro-2 shotgun-2 vacc-2

Bilante was born in Core, and was raised in Gushemege.  His father
was the author of _Socio-political Entropy in the Post-Frontier sectors_,
University of Ukshu press.

Bilante was a fast thinker, and decided to abandon college and
join the Merchants.  After spending 36 years with the Merchants,
he retired a 1st Officer and went travelling in the Spinward
Marches.  He had first experienced the Marches on his fifth
year with the Merchants, and grew to like the fronteir feel.
He keeps in contact with friends, traders, smugglers, and
brokers on several worlds, but lately has been concentrating
more and more on Treece.  He hopes to dabble in local politics
and pull enough strings to set up a trading post in the asteroid 
belt there.

World

Treece        2311 D232866-8    Na Po              610 Im M1 V
A small and insignificant world in the Rhylanor subsector of the
Spinward Marches, Treece is under the administration of Inthe.
It has 600 million inhabitants, a thin atmosphere, and more land
than water.  The Thricians rely on neigboring worlds to supply 
food and equipment; in return, Treece supplies raw materials for
Industrial worlds to process.  Treece\'s asteroid belt has indications
of having significant lanthanum and water deposits, as well as
crystal deposits formed by some ancient volcanic activity from some
undetermined world.

Though few regular passengers visit, Treece has quite a bit of
unrecorded trade activity.  The best starport is the Imperial \'D\' 
class Dukulal Down, which has some outbuildings and usually has fuel.
However, there is little incentive to monitor ships in orbit, 
since it isn\'t useful for hardly anything and has only a low-pop
TL8 infrastructure.  People are pretty much left alone here.  The
only exception is that taxes tend to be a bit harsh, most of which
go to Inthe to support its starport upgrade fund.  Thus has an
underground economy maintained a popular source of trade.

Adventure Seed

Our heroes are happened upon by a Mr. Bilante Disen, an ex-merchant
and small businessman, who promises free fuel and double the
normal freight costs for transporting goods to and from his small
trading post in the Treece asteroid belt.  He later asks them to
perform a preemptive strike on a crooked merchant who plans to
ransack his outpost.

If they help him, he will later tell them about the Spinners and
ask them to find a mature spinner.  Mature spinners would fetch
quite a price on the black market, and Mr. Disen is willing to share 
the profit with the players.

Contact!  Spinners (Echinodermus Thricia)

Spinners are creatures resembling the echinoderm family, with a
body encased in a tough shell and surrounded by a couple dozen
spines called \'probes\', which are composed of tiny interlocking
units of the same material as the shell.  These spines permit
movement; they are spaced at strategic points to allow the 
young spinner to roll along the ground, or if need be to spin 
along its central axis at speeds up to 10m/s in thin atmospheres.
Mature spinners have not been examined as of yet, so there is
no knowledge of their locomotive abilities, if any.

Spinners are small.  Young spinners\' shells are somewhat clamshell
shaped, about the size of the palm of your hand.  Their spines
are perhaps 12cm long; and though they are thin spines, they are
yet extremely strong: the tiny hooks on the ends of the spines
can hold with great force, and will infect if they are broken off
in an animal\'s skin.  The bacteria that live on the host spinner\'s
spines are often quite adaptable to human hair and nails, though
extremely uncomfortable to the human host.  Mature spinners are
more or less spherical and are probably around 12cm in radius; 
they have the nickname "purple basketball".  Basketballs have
very tough shells with a host-variable gas permeability, allowing
the creature to survive in very thin atmospheres indeed.  The
spinner\'s spines seem to be recessed in the adult; however, it is
assumed that they remain functional.  In the least, the Basketball
is able to borrow in sand slowly.  It is said that they burrow
partway into the sand to extract nutrients.

Spinners are rumored to live in small colonies on one of the
worlds in the Treece system.  The rumors are vague as to the
actual world, varying from Treece itself to some of the colder
worlds in the system outback.

A Fancy Gadget: The Turtle Shell

In a storage cabinet in an alien base on Fulacin lies a turtle-shell
shaped artifact.  1-meter long, 70 cm tall, covered with translucent 
knobby things, slits, and indented surfaces, and made with very durable 
looking material, one would be hard-pressed to guess what it is.  However, 
its outer skin may indicate to the trained eye that it is a spaceworthy 
object.  A magneto-resonant image, or some high-tech correspondant, 
will turn up a strange interior, where every device seems adapted to do
three different functions, and redundancy is the buzzword here.
There are coils that resemble gravity-related systems, and a dense
box that, if the players know what they are looking at, might suggest
an antimatter power source.  And there are gas or fluid processors of 
some kind.

This beastie is a remote system scout.  With extremely-long duration
and densely-packed charge storage units, this scout can store enough
charge to power its jump drive.  It can gather raw materials, generate
energy, jump into a system, gather information about a system, and
jump back out to the next system (or return home).

A flip side - if the standard idea that the crew are usually the owners of
a free trader, while they tend to be major sub owners of subsidized
merchants, then the crew as a whole needs to make as much as they would if
they just invested the money, more or less.  After all, if they could just
sell it and retire, then many would, leaving only the stupid and the cheap
as ship owners.

Clearly, it will not be exact, but in the main, people make about the
income appropriate for the assets needed to support them.

I am rereading H. Beam Piper\'s Empire collection.  In "A Slave is a Slave",
it is mentioned that the standard "Welcome back" team from the Empire is a
battle group consisting of one ship of the line, two cruisers, and four
destroyers.  The ship of the line is just under a mile in diameter, the two
cruisers are three thousand foot globes, and the destroyers have no size
given, but I would bet that they are in the thousand to fifteen hundred
foot range.

For the record, this is a total volume of

SOL: r = 2640 ft = 804 m, v = 2.2e9 m^3 = 156Mdt
Cruiser: r = 1500 ft = 457 m, v = 4.0e8 m^3 = 28MdT x2
Destroyer: r=750 ft = 228 m, v = 1.2e7 m^3 = 853KdT x4

For a total of 215 million displacement tons.

They were plated with collapsed matter, and could withstand nuclear
bombardment with little harm, and no nuclear dampers.  Anything less would
hardly scratch the paint.  Their primary armaments were guns and nuclear
command missiles.  I would not want to be on the other end of this battle
fleet - give them a short course in nuke pumped x ray lasers, and there is
little they could not do to the Imperial battle fleets.

All of the former Piper readers in my game snickered when they ran across
the Broadsword.

i want to start an PBEMAIL here in Germany, possible First of October. I\'m thinking of a variant,

played by a small group of Players to short cut the player\'s EMAIL discussions, from which the 
groups answers follows. I think, using this variant, i will avoid possible paranoia and group 
selfdestruction actions between the players, because the direction can be directed by the 
\'majority\' (only got two players yet ;-). And if one Player is quitting, hopefully the others can 
play further without great disruption. New players can read the story and beginn there discussions 
with the rest of the group providing new ideas. The hardest job will be for the group speaker to 
provide me with a clear answer.

My questions are:

Has anybody did it before?

Does anybody have ideas, links, sources for an possible _ONE_ Character Adventure? I think every 
Traveller source i own has been generated to be used as group Adv. (exceptions: Marooned Alone,

However, if you can\'t wait for Bryan to get in BITS/CORE products, try

Their web site is

they take all the big credit cards and their current catalogue lists the

101 Lifeforms

Lethal; neurtrino flux? I thought those things were so non-interactive
that they were totally harmless?

How about it\'s fleeing a supernova from an isolated extragalactic star? If
it was in the galaxy it would be silly go go more than 6 or 7 parsecs
because you\'d find a perfectly reasonable star to orbit by that time. Even
if being that close to a supernova would be a problem, you could still
find one within 20 parsecs, and going at say 0.6C this would only take 100
years. 

However, what if it\'s way out in intergalactic space?  If it\'s 1,000
parsecs out the journey would take 5,000 years, plenty of time...

I like this one.  This would even allow there to be a number of different

Or, after 5,000 years and a huge freeze & thaw they may simply have been

Only one option really, zero point energy.  Everyone in the Imperium and
beyond would *love* to get their hands on that secret.

I\'ve been talking about not leaving behind enough info to be caught.
That includes not only if the information is sufficient to identify
them, but also to catch up with them.

Yes, but you are assuming that if you identify illegal activity on
on system, you will then be able to trace that ship on every other
world.  This gets back into "fool proof records" and kind of records
(do you know where they went after they left?  If not, you have
to check different destinations, increasing the complexity cost
of the operation).

Well, I never suggested man-years, you did.  I also don\'t see what
a trail "that goes up to the subsector level" means.  If you think
they are forwarded to the subsector headquarters, it could go
either way.  It depends on whether they want to bother with
info for each ship.  For antipiracy efforts I think you are
a lot better off processing the info on planet rather then
shipping to HQ and have it looked at weeks later.

Witnesses can be valuable in tracking criminals, but if they were
that foolproof the most wanted list in the US wouldn\'t exist.

Ship size is a pretty thin reed to catch a pirate on.  With
standard hulls, there are a lot of ships in the 200-600 tone range.

Well, this gets back to being able to change your identity, which

Well, "merchant pirates" don\'t have bases and the fence probably doesn\'t
even know their real identitites.  (Though, yes there would be
_some_ risk of fencing being able to rat on pirates.  That would
make the crime risking buy not impossible like many crimes today).

Oooh, that would set up all sorts of interesting sociological

And how are they going to get it? _I_ sure wouldn\'t be the first scout

I thought making money was too easy.  Once I figured that out it was a

For a similar good time on a classic game look for Sentinel Worlds.
Similar and traveller like, butt harder to solve as I recall.

Actually, the neutrino flux is quite dangerous near a supernova.  Remember,
according to most theories, at least the ones I have seen, something on the
order of a third the energy produced by the reaction goes off in the form
of neutrinos.  Further, they escape the core immediately (in essence) which
causes a dramatic pressure drop, a gravitational collapse, and all sorts of
other effects.

ISTR, though this is a stretch, that the neutrino blast is what shreds the
outer layer of the star.

Neutrinos have a very small chance of reacting, but it is nonzero.  The
mean free path is something comfortably longer than a planet, but enough of
them going through a point will cause some to react in a dangerous manner.

You must be thinking about someone else. I believe that the Imperial Navy
would want to prevent piracy anywhere in the Imperium _regardless_ of the
economic aspects and that only lack of resources would prevent them. I also
believe that the role of the Imperial Navy in regards to piracy suppression
in the CT publications involves a discrepancy: Canonically they have the
will to suppress pirates. Thus their failure to do so must be due to lack
of resources. Yet an analysis of canonical Imperial Navy forces indicates
(to me) that they _do_ have the means available (at least in peacetime).
Thus their failure to suppress piracy must be due to lack of will.

What I do believe is that private enforcement measures (which would be
based on trade volume) alone should be enough to reduce piracy to a level
far below that portrayed in CT sources.

IMO you could argue both ways because either way you get a discrepancy. If
Regency taxation of passengers and freight is an innovation, then Regency
transportation costs should not be the same as Imperial. OTOH, if Imperial
tax practices resembles the Regency\'s, the life support rules in
_Beltstrike_ is wrong.

After thinking it over my preference would be to change the life support
rules and costs (a revised version of my alternate life support rules
based on the assumption that half the official costs are a Crimp1000 tax
will be posted soon) AND remove said Imperial tax retroactively, lowering
M1100 transportation costs. The main reason for this would be to reduce
the Imperial interest in tramp freighters, which would be a good thing
from a RPG perspective.

I\'m a CT person, and I was impressed with the Regency Sourcebook[*]. I\'ve
been mining it for ideas for M1100 (extrapolating backwards).

[*] I am a bit worried about the population increases in RS. If those
    increases are representative of the whole Imperial era, the whole
    history of the Traveller Universe is in trouble.

Unfortunately that can\'t be true in all cases, since the TU abounds in
planets with too small a population to sustain its TL. So IMTU the
planetary TL indicates the level that most of the population live at.
In many cases this will come to the same thing, as using locally
produced equipment will be cheaper than using imported stuff, so the
middle and lower classes will all be using locally products. But in
some cases everybody use imports. Mostly this would be low-population
worlds whose economy is tied to a planet with that TL (mining colonies,
scientific outposts, etc.).

That wasn\'t me. System defenses would IMO depend on population production
(the RUs from _Pocket Empires_), which would determine how much the locals
can afford if they want to spend it, modified by a percentage showing how
much they want to spend. I use the 3% figure from _Striker_ for Imperial
worlds. 

The amount of interstellar commerce would also be a factor, not to
determine system defenses, but to determine commerce protection. Both the
political pressure put on the Imperial Navy, but also the amount of
private protection merchants (or their insurance carriers) would be
willing to spend if they couldn\'t get the IN to do the job for free.

Come to think of it, interstellar commerce would affect defense budgets
insofar as it increased the effective RU production of the system.

My take is just a little different from either of you.  IMTU the TL
refers to the level of technology that is generally available, and
that Travellers can get access to.  The items might be widespread and
available to everybody, or they might be restricted and available to
only an elite, but are most likely available for sale to offworlders.

IMTU, the tech might be inexpensive or expensive, it might be locally
produced or it might be imported.  The only thing that a system\'s TL
tells the Traveller is that when he gets there he should be able to
find technological items at that level.  Hopefully, he\'ll be able to
buy them, but there\'s no assurance of that.  

In fact, there might be items available at higher TL\'s.  They just
aren\'t generally available, and there\'s no guarantee you\'ll be able to
find, afford, or acquire them even if they are.

Eris,
    All IMTU

I think an S-curve is what Michael is asking for. 

I think a formula based on something like, x+x^2-x^3, gives a basic S
shape, unfortuately it isn\'t bounded and will quickly go negative.

The best simulation I\'ve found for a rise, plateau, rise, plateau, etc
cycle is something like, sin(x)+x.  Plot a chart with a base of x = 1
with an increase of 0.1 to see what I mean.

If I interpret that sentence correctly, you are arguing that a ship which
is engaged in normal merchant operations will somehow be able to avoid
leaving behind enough information for a subsequent investigation to be
able to establish it was visiting this world on that date. How exactly
do you think that is possible? Every passenger it carries and every cargo
it delivers leaves behind witnesses and records that it was there. And
then there is the still irrefutable fact that if there is any sort of
starport authority on the planet (which means all with Class D and better
starports and at least some with Class E starports), it will have to use
its real transponder code.

Well, I assume that faking engine and hull numbers is a whole lot more
difficult than using fake transponder codes. In other words, you don\'t
use a fake transponder code just for the hell of it. Come to that, I
also assume that people don\'t just consign cargoes to any passing ship
without at least some pretty impressive proof of identity.

A list of ship departures and arrivals for each system is trivially easily
to procure. They will contain a deal of errors, of course, but you can
easily eliminate most of the ships on those lists based on the fact that
they were demonstrably elsewhere. The remaining number of ships will have
to be checked individually.

Yep. I argued that even if it costs a few man-years, it would be worth it.
If the cost turns out to be counted in man-hours instead, it just makes my
argument that much stronger.

>I also don\'t see what a trail "that goes up to the subsector level" means.

If the Imperium taxes passenger and cargo traffic, tax records will be
gathered at each starport and forwarded to the Subsector Capital (They
may even reach the Sector level). Said records will give a splendid
itinerary for each ship.

If they are taxing the ships\' activities, they will be happy to bother with
info for each and every one of them.

Actually, at the moment I\'m looking into the possibilities of tracking
impromptu pirates after the fact, which means that I\'m assuming for
purposes of argument that little or no preventive measures are taken.
I agree with you that some cheap preventive measures are very likely to
exist, but since you\'ve argued that in the absence of recent pirate
attacks, piracy prevention will inevitably be reduced to a level where
it is no longer effective, I\'ve tried to show that even with NO preventive
measures at all, a merchant turned pirate will be in deep shit.

>Witnesses can be valuable in tracking criminals, but if they were
>that foolproof the most wanted list in the US wouldn\'t exist.

That comparison would mean something only if all people in the US had to
visit City Hall and show their identity papers in each new town they
arrived in. And not even then. I\'m not talking about keeping track of 200
million people or 100 million cars, but a couple of thousand ships.

What are you talking about? This ship is engaged in regular merchant
activities. Even if they did include wilderness refuelling (I don\'t
want to revive that argument, so I\'ll assume it for purposes of
argument), he would still have to visit the starport afterwards to
do business.

I notice that you grasp at the extreme. Ship size is the absolutely
lowest limit of information you will have. If the pirate don\'t capture
the ship (as you\'ve argued would be the case), you\'ll have a lot more.
But just the size will go a long way. Yes, there are many, say, 200 T
ships. But how many of them left a system within range of where the
piracy took place a week earlier? How many of them didn\'t turn up at
another destination that week? How many of them was carrying cargo
or passengers to that system? (BTW. what does our impulsive pirate do
about the cargo and passengers he is carrying? You say he isn\'t carrying
any? Then how is he making a living as a merchant?) How many of them
dropped out of sight for weeks after the event?

Even if you were able to change engine and hull numbers (an assumption
I guess I will have to allow you), you still end up with the rather
obvious clue that you have one ship disappearing and another without
proper antescedents appearing at the same time. You can get away with that
sort of thing as long as no one is looking for you. But how long will
it take before an insurance investigator or a navy intelligence analyst
figures out the ship that suddenly appears out of nowhere at the same time
that the suspect disappears is worth a closer look?
