No. The absolutely biggest beef I have with the vanilla trade system is
that the prices of goods in the trade system does not fit with the prices
of goods everywhere else.

Let us take, for example, Colt .45 pistols and ammunition built under FFS2.
A rugged pistol - a useful good on a low-tech world, an instant antique on
a high tech world.

Now, according to FFS2, Colt 4.5 ammo costs 0.38 Cr per round, and a round
is 35 mm x 11 mm, so you should be able to fit 200 000 in a 1m3 box.

Thus, 10 m3 of .45 ammo should cost KCr 760 and contain 2 million rounds.

The pistols themselves cost Cr 253 including magazine, and I will assume
they are 30cm long, 20cm high and 10cm wide, including some packing. Thus,
1500 will fit in a 1m3 box, costing KCr 380.

Therefore, 1 dton of light firearms (1500 colt .45s and 2 million rounds)
should cost about KCr 1140.

Other goods have similar costs - TL10 1 MJ EPG cartridges (used in plasma
guns) cost Cr 500 and mass 5 kg each, so 10 000 kg of them cost a megacredit.

TL8 10 MW fission plants take up 10 m3 and cost a megacredit.

TL9 Sens 13 passive infrared scanners take up 8m3 and cost MCr 8.

Now, if you take goods up to a megacredit a dton, then long-distance trade
becomes a lot more viable - it is worth taking a shipment across 2 subsectors.

Merchants now find that cash position becomes more important - you dont
just need the next montly payment, you need ready access to a *large*
amount of cash to act as a float for cargo purchases.

If you are shipping goods across a subsector, it might be a while before
that cargo turns into liquid cash, too. Financing becomes even more
critical - your credit rating becomes like gold when you need an ability to
borrow tens of megacredits for several months.

It isnt that they are money losers that gets me - it\'s the massive trade
deficits being run by the lo-tech worlds that lead me to think that they
system outlined is unsustainable.

The trade system should be built so that there are no \'sure win\' routes,
because if any idiot can make money shipping stuff from A to B, then every
idiot will be doing that, and prices at each end will react.

Dear Folks -

Thomas Vickers asked:
>Subject: Long Night
>Is there a web page on this subject or can the list fill me in?

Sorry, Thomas, there is not much available _at all_ on this topic. While =
writing up the Library Data onto my site, I noticed that there is NO =
entry for the Long Night", per se. There are only slant-wise references. =
For example, there are entries on "Ramscoop Jumpship" (the _Exatar_ was =
built by the Interstellar Confederacy during the LN), "Second Imperium" =
(which includes a brief mention), "Solomani History" (which includes a =
paragraph on the LN), and "Twilight" (which is not yet up on my site).

The _Milieu 0_ book talks more about the LN and it\'s timeline than any =
other reference I know. No of these entries are up on my Lib Data site =
*yet*.

Other sources should include the various "integrated timelines" - try =
looking through my Jump Points page for these.

Here is a possible *player* explanation for the lack of data - the =
events of the Long Night were either so ugly (and therefore censored) or =
so lost in obscurity (no records survived, etc), that it is effectively =
a "black hole" in history. Hey - I can feel a plot hook coming on!! =
Maybe your PC\'s can be sent on an archeological mission to discover/dig =
up some data on the LN in a particular region.

Good luck!

The other major consideration is everybody\'s favorite point-attack weapon,
the meson gun.

Now, Meson Guns attack a point, not a line, as is true with beam weapons
like lasers and PAWs. Thus, you get 3 dimensions to dodge in, not two.

Normally, this would make meson guns pretty damn ineffective at light
second ranges, but the optimal maneuver path for a meson gun is non-optimal
for defending against beam weapons.

Thus, if you are using a mixture of beam and meson weapons, the defender
has the choice between defending against meson guns by maneuvering in three
dimensions (but making themsleves more vulnerable to beams) or maneuvering
in two dimensions at right angles to the attacker, and thus removing the
long-range penalty for meson guns.

True - but does it really matter whether or not the Solomani and
Imperial calendars are in synch?  Remember, local calendars are
going to be tied to phenomena with strictly local significance,
whereas the Imperial calendar serves the entire Imperium for
Imperial matters.  Even if it does show an untoward level of
Solomani influence.

Some interesting reading on the subject of calendars can be found
in the Calendar FAQ (which can be found in the usual places for
Usenet FAQs) - it discusses a _lot_ of different calendars, with
some information as to their derivations and how they work.  Even
though virtually the entire world currently uses the Gregorian
calendar for general purposes, some of these other calendars,
such as the Jewish, Islamic, and Chinese calendars, are still
used for religious purposes.  One can reasonably expect the same
thing to happen in the Traveller milieu; local calendars will
continue to be used, more or less depending on the relative
significance of offworld contact in the affairs of the world.

I\'d really like to hear from Those Who Know what the exact
corresponding dates and times are, so I can write a correct
calendar program to convert between the various calendars.

Surveyed is anyone\'s guess.  From Imperium, the Terran setup has the
following:

Worlds:  	Sol, Alpha Centauri A, Alpha Centauri B
Outposts:	Junction, Barnard\'s Star, Proxima Centauri

Plus 3 unplaced outposts - We could take this as outposts that were
planned, but not established before the war.

The Vilani have:

Worlds:		Dingir, Gashidda, Ishkur, and in 3 other "primary systems"
Outposts:	7 Outposts placed so as to connect all friendly systems.

3 Outposts are required to connect the Worlds:  Enki Kalamma,
Shulgiili/Allamu, and Shulgi, so only four are really available to connect
the others.
Primary systems available are:  Epsilon Eridani (Shulimik), Tau Ceti
(Iilike), Nusku, Lagash and Amarku.  Mirabilis needs to be connected
through too long a chain of outposts.

OK, there are worlds that only appear in Imperium here:  Alpha Centauri B,
Proxima Centauri, Allamu and Amarku.  These are all from double or triple
star systems.  Amarku is from the same system as Lagash, Allamu from the
same as Shulgiili.  

Spellings sometimes vary too:  Shulgiili/Shilgiili comes to mind.

Guessing as to surveyed area:  how about the area on the Imperium map, and
maybe a bit deeper into Vilani space - say to Muan Gwi.  The actual detail
of the surveying is another question....

Yes, its from Solomani Rim, and reprinted in the CT Solomani Alien Module.

The strategic choices were shaped by only having J2 ships available.  It
was a whole different universe to one with J3+.

See above.  The large scale maps of the Vilani Imperium should give some
kind of idea about settlement, too.

Solomani Rim and Solomani give some more information including that at
least bits of Albadawi and Arcturus subsectors had been settled by later in
the wars.  Settlement of Jardin only "began in earnest only after the
establishment of the Solomani Autonomous Region", and so on.  

Astrographically, there seems to be a bit of a rift through most of the
Solomani Rim, which constrains travel by J2 ships to coreward.  This
suggests that exploration rimward of Terra would have been fairly limited. 
Given that "apparently" the Vilani didn\'t discover Terra either, a more
conservative exploration limit might be appropriate.

Hopefully this will be useful.

This is an interesting period.  "One day" I will do something with it as
well.

BTW your ship is basically a blind man with respect to this
projectile,  an unpowered kinetic projectile with a cross section of
less than 2cm moving at 4Km/s  (current velocities, probably much
faster in Traveller terms ) is almost impossible to detect in time to
react to it.

And, of course the above argument completely misses the fact that
railguns are _cheap_ in comparison to missiles beam weapons etc.

Your blind ship may luckily detect and avoid _one_ such projectile,
what if we throw five
thousand at you a minute in a cloud ?
(Yes, you\'ll probably detect the cloud before it spreads )

The _only_ real defense against rail guns is _very_ thick armour planetoid or several metres
concrete or a foot or two of modern spaced armour ) or a black globe.
Dodging the projectiles is really not an option.

The major reason rail gun usage  would be limited is that the
projectile doesn\'t care _whose_ ship it hits.  OK if you stay "in line
of battle" like ancient sailing ships, but damn dangerous if the
battle turns into a rolling 3D dog fight.

It will also keep going. Imagine the flack you\'d get from high command
if you if you fired on the wrong vector and hit the planet or star
port you were trying to defend !

No disagreement with your descriptoin of laser targetting  though.

You mean the game that was on the BBC, and was then copied to most
other platforms at the time including, Commodore 64,  Atari and PC.
There is a descendant of this still available on the PC, the
"Frontier" series.

I still have an original copy of BBC Elite complete with the "novel"
that accompanied it as background material, "The Dark Wheel", by
Richard Holdstock. It\'s more a short story or novella really,  I think
it was called a novel becasue it was a novel idea to provide such
background material for a computer game back then.

If you have galatic 2.4 you have my answer already :*>. However MHO all the 
worlds in the jump 1 group rimward of Terra (Prometheus, Peraspera, Junction, 
Fenris, Midway, Hades, Hespaitos, Calgery, Inferno and Forlorn) have been 
survey and settled. However only Prometheus (90 million) and Junction (10 
million) could be considered to be solidly colonised. The others have between 
20,000 and 5 million but are best regarded as outposts. The Terrans would have 
most likely expanded as far and as fast as possible in an attempt to secure 
their position against the Vilani, but being limited to TL 9 they would only be so 
far that they could go.

I know this is canon, but it conflicts radically with the map in AM6 which shows 
the TC controlling a very substaintial region to rimward. My handwave to deal 
with this is that the Terrans did expand a lot down a narrow corridor (the 
Capella and Gemini subsectors) leaving the surrounding space as a buffer to 
protect their colonies; and then expanded out in the Canopus, Aldaberan and 
Neworld sectors.

Only my own work for Prometheus Rising.

To put it simply, none. They had not colonised any worlds anywhere for a 
thousand years. It would seem unlikely that they would suddenly start.

Penguins will follow flying items.  For some reason (jealousy?) the are
fascinated by things in flight.  RAF pilots discover that the massive
penguins colonies along South Georgia\'s coast would watch them as the flew
by.  Harrier pilots loved to make a few slow passes from left to right,
like a slow-motion tennis mach, then go out to sea and come straight over
the colony.  The penguins would keep looking up, up, up...

And 20,000 penguins would fall on their asses simultaneously.

Well, according to Imperium, each starship counter represents a squadron of
individual ships, and each troop counter represents a reinforced division. 
Planetary defense markers represent "extensive batteries of missile and
beam installations as well as supporting fire control provisions", whatever
that means.  

Well, I\'d guess that the squadrons would roughly be about the same size at
3I squadrons.  In the 1st IW, the Terran squadrons, particularly, might be
more variable and less homogeneous, since according to the CT Solomani
Alien Module, it was fought by national squadrons under tenuous fleet
control.  In other words, it was "come as you are".

How big are the ships?  How long is a piece of string?  I would guess that
they might be smaller than their 3I equivalents, but the clunkiness of the
technology might require larger ships to pack spinal mounts, and so on. 
The best source might be the MT ship book - "Fighting Ships of the
Shattered Imperium" or whatever it is.  I don\'t have a copy, so I don\'t
know what it has in it exactly, but IIRC it had lots of TL 10-11 stuff.  Of
course, then you have to convert them to other systems, if you\'re not using
MT.

Ground Forces:  Use existing stuff on ground forces from other periods, and
design suitable equipment at the TL.

Well, Andrew MV has some figures in Galactic 2.4.  I\'m not sure where he
got them from, but I suspect it\'s rule of thumb:  "Worlds" have more
population than "Outposts".  Anyway, I\'ll leave him to explain his logic,

According to the rules, game turns are two Terran years. 

Anyway, I hope there is something useful here.  Andrew would be a good
person to chase.

I took Micheal Barry\'s suggested rules for generating Vilani worlds and 
regenerated them from scratch. Then took the data in Imperium and other 
published sources and modified the raw data to match.

Micheal\'s ideas for Vilani worlds are based on the idea that lacking advanced 
biomedical technology, it would have been much harder for them to colonise 
marginal worlds. Thus in my data you will note that worlds with hostile 
environments tend to have much lower population and frequently they are 
uninhabited. Also I did not equalise the Vilani technology. In the Ziru Sirka the 
Vilani restricted access to technology as a form of control, therefore you will 
find a wide spread of technology.

Actually IMHO this would be more pronounced than in later eras. The Vilani so 
totally dominate trade that they can prevent high tech goods from reaching low 
tech worlds (Okay Shiruk is TL 7, therefore it only needs TL 7 goods, therefore 
it only gets TL 7 goods, therefore it is unable to challange the central authority 
of the ZS). Okay it wouldn\'t be quite that severe, but the ZS attitude was fairly 
much "the people have what they need, why give them more?"

a number of upgrades to V2.0 including:-

1) Ability to load Sector Files (*.SEC)
2) Ability to display data in RICE Paper format. (Extended UWP Data only at
moment.)
3) Temperature Worksheet calculated.
4) Ability to select Random Number Seed.
5) Calculations added for Travel Zones and Satellites.
6) Ability to select which Data is displayed.

V3.1 of my Sector Generator is actually a bug fix. I noticed that V3
generates an \'Out of Memory\' error with rather alarming frequency. This has
now been fixed in V3.1.

They can both be downloaded for the usual location on my website.

Before going to full moderation, there is one archaic suggestion that I would like 
to offer.  Back in the dawn of time (around 1991), the TML was _only_ offered in
digest form, and the fact that you didn\'t get instant response cycles going seemed
to help to keep the discussion focussed on Traveller.  How many other TML dinosaurs
are still out there, I wonder?

I\'ve had to change ISPs recently, by the way, so anyone needing to contact me
now needs to find me at rsdean@erols.com vice robdean@access.digex.net.

With a return to more mainstream Traveller (i.e. more CT-like) with GURPS, I\'m
dusting off my books and settling down for a bit of reading.  I hope to find a
store with all of the GURPS Trav books available at one shot in the near future,
but I expect I\'ll continue to use MT.

    HEPlaR:  The other thrust agency [other than propellors, that is, which
were treated in the preceding section], high efficiency plasma recombustion
(HEPlaR), becomes available at tech level 10.  It may be added to any power
plant by adding a heat exchanger recombustion chamber to the plant.
Hydrogen is injected into the recombustion chamber and the power generated
by the engine heats the hydrogen to a plasma state.  The plasma is then
released as a high velocity stream of reaction mass, providing thrust.
    HEPlaR requires a recombustion chamber of 0.1 cubic meters in volume
per megawatt of power devoted to thrust, and in turn generates 20 metric
tonnes of thrust per megawatt.  The recombustion chamber masses 1 tonne per
cubic meter of recombustion chamber and costs 0.001 million credits per
megawatt of power.  It consumes 0.25 cubic meters of liquid hydrogen (LHyd)
per hour per megawatt of power and may be used on any type of airframe.
Hull surface area (used for spacecraft only) in square meters is equal to
thrust (in tonnes) / 200.

The only problem I had with HEPlaR was the way it was used - it became
*the* TNE manoeuvre drive, used in *everything*.  Fine for starships and
spacecraft, but it was also also used in vehicles - look at the TL14
Intrepid grav tank, RC TL12 convertible "ragtop" air raft, and TL13 Pyrrhus
support sled in the *Reformation Coalition Equipment Guide* (pp 112, 114,
and 126. respectively).  Life must be very exciting for pedestrians in
cities where all of the air rafts and other grav vehicles are being
propelled (and presumably steered) by "high velocity streams" of plasma!
And picture the Scout Service air raft, preparing to explore a new planet,
landing in a prairie or forest after several months of drought....

Lower level stuff, yes, but most of it was trash.  The ships were far too
large, IMO - starting with 10kton escorts and running up to 700kton
battleships.  (If I ever actually use any of the ships, I\'ll divide the
displacement by 10 and then recompute.)  And the profiles were seriously
flawed.  Two examples:

     - In *every* ship design, the number of gunners was the same as the
number of flight crew, regardless of the number of guns and the number of
subcraft;
     - Cargo space used for tankage (ie, extra fuel carried, ad in a
tanker) kept popping up in the strangest places, and in very peculiar
amounts - my copy of the book is over at the storage unit, so I can\'t look
it up, but I distinctly recall one design which supposedly carried several
times its own displacement in tankage.

In 2061, Arthur C. Clark talks about something like this either on Europa,

Space combat in Frontier left something to be desired.  It almost always

an unaltered human to effectively target enemy ships at ten or more kilometers

I always thought that this game, fleshed out with actual character roll playing
when on the ground or in space stations would make a great Traveller type
game.  Something like the Hexplore interface would be nice.

Of course a Traveller game like this just wouldn\'t be complete without a
vehicle and ship design system.  Say you travel over to one of the local
shipbuilders and are given the option of easily designing a unique ship
in graphical format.  This would be cool.

Erm, a while ago someone mentioned a Mac Emulator for Windows which worked
well enough to run Infini-V (Doug?), and there was a limited freeware
release. In addition, ISTR someone mentioning an expensive PC package (500
GBP plus) which could convert or run them. But I haven\'t got the references
anymore.

Myst was based on Hypercard so there must be something out there...

Has anyone looked into this?

Well, it was actually released originally for the Acorn BBC Model B
Computer in the UK. Some of the ports were great (the ST one was really
close in feel to the BBC). I played it a lot when I was younger..

There was at least one sequel - Frontier - but the combat was lousy (proper
physics and inertia so it tended to degenerate into high speed firing
passes).

If it was an attachment it won\'t make the Digest :-(

Anyway, only Space:1889 had proper Brits in Space.

High Energy PLAsma Recombustion

A plasma torch drive connected to a fusion plant, otherwise known as \'the

************************************************************

You can see it is a nasty Q-ship type of craft. Externally, it looks identical to the Resolve but it has AF 40 all round, NO emissions, and a RPX-gun (I forgot I included a turret - although I didn\'t include the point defence!). We also couldn\'t fit an airlock in. Shucks.

Top speed of 600 kph, the whole thing costs too much for most PC\'s: MCr 10.8 (the original Resolve costs MCr 3 for AF 10 and top speed of 420 kph). This thing *cruises* faster than the original\'s top speed!

I\'ve noticed I\'m cheating a little - I only have 2 computers. Don\'t flying craft need three? I *do* have 3 disp. tons of cargo space available...

Note that I haven\'t modified the Damage Points - I believe that the errata is that they should be multiplied by 10 to give the equivalent personal combat Damage Points?

Anyway, now that I\'ve copied it across from the Amiga to the PC, I\'ll tidy it up and post it on my site RSN, I promise... ;-)

[very useful examples snipped]

Actually, I have the purchase price for speculative cargo as:
Cargo size * Base purchase price * Price Multiplier
and the sale price is
Cargo size * base market value * Price multiplier * Actual value.

The price multiplier runs from .016 to 16. Average purchase
prices for manufactured goods on non-industrial HiPop worlds
should run in the 12-20 kCr per cargo ton range. (I take 1 cargo
ton= 1 m3)

Another effect is that I take prices as in the book or computed
using FFS as the prices which final consumers pay, or *retail*
prices. Starship cargos are generally carried at *wholesale*, so
that means something like half your prices right away. That\'s the
starship\'s selling price, and the purchase price is even lower
than that.

Based on your examples, my prices still seem a bit low, but
they\'re closer to the right order of magnitude.

There is also the possiblity that long-distance trade would be
carried, not as speculative cargo, but as *freight* at 1 kCr per
m3 per jump.  10 m3 TL-8 10 MW fission plants are not the kind of
thing that first leaps to mind when I think speculative trade
goods.

I figure a speculative free trader with less than a couple of MCr
on hand is going to be seriously cramped.  [A 50 ton cargo
running kCr 30 per ton isn\'t all that much of a rarity, and if
you\'re going somewhere it\'s very likely to fetch a good price,
you\'ll be sorry you couldn\'t afford it.]  Having even short-term
financing arrangements in place if you don\'t want to carry a
_lot_ of cash and you think you\'ve really struck gold this time
might be useful.

   If you can expect to lose a few hundred credits a ton and not
make it up somewhere, you can expect to go out of business in
short order. Big trade deficits do still seem to be a problem.
   One thing that might help and still needs to be looked at is
the problem of price restraints. (Ever notice that under the
basic trade rules, very few high tech cargos are too expensive to
be sold at the destination?)  Another is the effect of
competition. (I\'m at TL-8. Do I want a TL-12 Thingamabob from
World A for Cr 4800, or a TL-9 Thingamabob from World B for Cr
4000?)

The price and competition factors again. But in this model you do
have to be a little savvier in choosing cargoes. It\'s easy to
lose money on a "profitable"  route if you carry the wrong thing.

>I\'d like to see the details.

The writeup is longer than I expected, so rather than post it
here, I\'ll e-mail it as a DOS text file on request to:
Sapience@compuserve.com.

Before I do that, though, I hope I\'m not trampling Marc\'s rights
if I include a few tables, some of them slightly modified, from
T4 and TNE.

Rob,

I seem to recall you being located in the vicinity of Washington DC.  If this is indeed
true, you might want to check Dream Wizards, in Rockville.  Also, there\'s a hobby shop
in Laurel that has a wide range of GURPS, including some G:T hardbacks.

        I *loved* that game...  Landing on the stations was a bit tedious
until I could afford the automated landing system.  For a c64, the graphics
were vunderbar.

        If you enjoyed that game, I highly recommend the "Privateer" games
from Origin Games.  Set in the Wing Commander universe, and is a nice blend
of all the elements that made "Elite" so much fun.

I think you\'re mistaken. Jack Holloway\'s remark shows that hyperspace
travel cause a discrepancy between chronological age and physiological
age, but I\'m as sure as I can be without going home to check first that
the difference is the other way around, ie. that you age less while in
hyperdrive than the universe around you. As for Space Viking, the whole
"keeping track of Andray Dunnay" plot-line shows that it takes hyperships
a measuable time (at the universe\'s rate) to get from one place to another.

	I\'ll defer to Bruce Macintosh or somebody else with detailed sensor
knowledge for a clear analysis of detecting the railgun projectile.
I\'ll just point out:

	1) At TL7, we routinely detect and track objects on the same order
of size. Granted, it\'s not an instantaneous detect, but we\'ve got
plenty of time here (see #3 ...).

	2) The ship *firing* the projectile will be detectable, which means
that 
		a) I\'m aware of the risk of being fired on by railgun
		b) I know exactly where to concentrate at least one of my sensors
to be certain of detecting the projectile. Again, Bruce can tell you
how much your chances of detecting a small object go when you switch
your sensor from scanning the full sky to focusing on a patch a few
arcseconds across. All I remember from the discussion is it\'s a big
increase.

	3) At 4 km/s and space combat ranges (30,000 to 300,000km in TNE, or
1/10 to 1ls), you have plenty of time (2 hrs to 21 hours ...) to
detect damn near anything. Further, at the closer ranges where we
have less time, it\'s easier to detect anyway ...

	4) Targeting your ballistic (non-maneuvering) projectile so it will
hit a maneuvering target 2+ hours later is pointless. Even *if* I
don\'t know you\'re there (because you\'re far enough away for stealth
to help), and don\'t know I\'m being fired on, and I\'m on a purely
unpowered trajectory because I\'m in no hurry to get anywhere, the
slightest course correction on my part will cause it to miss.

>Dodging the projectiles is really not an option.

	Why not? I can detect it far enough out, and I\'ve got *hours* in
which to maneuver. The *only* way you can get a cloud big enough to
hit me is to be close enough/have them moving fast enough and have a
spread such that at 1/2 a*t^2, I can\'t clear the cloud, and I can\'t
vaporize them with lightspeed weaponry. A ROF800 laser can tag quite
a few...

	I can only see railguns being useful IF

	(a) You use unrealistically short sensor ranges.
	(b) You chop the traditional Traveller weapons ranges down to match,
so your ship can get close enough without being slagged by lightspeed
weapons.
	(c) You severely limit maneuverability.

	This is against spacecraft, of course. Railguns become slightly more
useful against space stations nobody bothered to give an evasive
capability, and as planetary bombardment weapons.

Elite was a great game. The original author Ian Bell has now allowed the
game to be downloaded direct from the web at the following site. There are
various versions of it. You can download it from
http://people.netcom.co.uk/i.bell/elite/Default.html along with the HTML
version of the origanal manual. I still have a BBC B and the original Elite

Privateer II is far more in-depth I\'ve found. When I get some time playing I
can really get into the game. Unfortunately though, I\'m usually too busy
working to play too many other games ...

The problem with Mac emulation on a PC is the ROM. Unless you own the Mac in
question it\'s illegal to use the ROM from a Mac in software form on your PC.
This applies to BBC, Atari, Amiga etc emulation as well - a familiar
argument that rages with the MAME emulation of arcade games.

There is a Mac emulator called VMac that allows you that comes with OS
6.0-ish of the Mac Os, and includes the hypercard software. AFAIK it reads
PC disks as Mac disks, so you should be able to access your files - even
save them on a PC disk in a Mac machine. The URL for it is
http://www.vmac.org . I have a local copy of the emulation software. If
anyone emails me direct I can forward it to them.

  Of all places, Starfire Empires had a rule early on that the advantage
of trade was a percentage (~10%, IIRC) increase in both economies, but
that the size of the smaller was the limit to the amount of the larger 
that could be involved in the transaction.

 I.E. - pocket empire of 50 RU and minor world of 5 RU; both gain 0.5 RU
to their production as long as the relationship remains, and 45 RU of the
PE is still available to seek other markets to become involved with.

  IIRC from checking the novels the last time this came up, and from posts
of research by others on the Piper list:

 1) there were significant discrepancies with earlier hyperdrive speeds, but
ISTR references that make the passage of shipboard time explicitly evident.

 2) time appears to be pretty much 1:1 at 1 c-y/hour by the Space Viking era.

29? Pah. The characters in my current 150 points (+ ~15 experience) campaign
have 28, 48 and 139 respectively distinctive skills (defaults removed...)
(The one with 139 is a converted character in my recently restarted campaign
who in a slightly non-standard T4 chargen system had 4 careers (thrown out
of them all), and ended up with JOT4. When he was converted GT was not even
a gleam in SJ\'s eye, and I figured the best way to handle converting JOT was
to give him lots of skills at low levels, in an essentially random way. We
had a lot of fun coming up with explanations for why/how the same character
could have, to mention only a few, Micropaleontology, Semaphore,
Nuclear-Biological-Chemical Warfare, Stone Knapping and Filch. Clearly, his
career was as interesting as the dicerolls in the T4 character creation
seemed to indicate. Of the four previously mentioned skills it seems he
might get a chance to *use* Semaphore in play. He doesn\'t have much hope for
the rest... ;-)

But bragging rights aside (;-) the average gurps character in my campaigns
does seem to have about 30-40 skills, with simple fantasy fighters (*simple*
being the operative word. As in \'unbelievably stupid\') sometimes getting
along with as few as 10-15. Mages/scientists generally go hog-wild in the
skill-lists. (Of course, this is probably influenced by me (the GM)
genuinely disliking one-skill-johnnies, so I encourage players to take more
skills.)

Dif\'rent strokes for dif\'rent folks I guess. Me, I find the other two main
munchkin baits in Gurps far more irritating.
To wit:
The Stat Monster. (High DX and IQ, default everything at ridiculously high
levels.)
One-Skill-Johnny. (One or two *reelly c00l* skills at 25+. In fantasy games
Deathtouch is a classic, in modern/sf campaigns Guns & Fast-Draw are
common.)

Not true. At .9 c, time is passing for the can at .44 the rate it is
for you. That means that if you nail it 1 second from impact, the
pieces only get to spread for .44 seconds. At .99 c, they only get to
spread for .14 seconds. 

v	tau
- ----	----
.9	.435
.99	.141
.999	.0447
.9999	.0141

And the "vector spread" you are talking about has to be *added* to the
existing vector. Thus, you change from a compact mass following a line,
to a more spread out mass following a narrow cone. And at most of those
velocities, the impact will be as if you got hit by the mother of all
particle beams.

The target has to be able to *detect* the projectile in time as well.
Detecting an "ultra black" stealth contoured 1 kg projectile isn\'t
easy. But at a high enough velocity, such a projectile can ruin your
whole day.

My favorite setup for railguns is against ships with limited delta-V
(rockets of one sort or another) that are in a Hohmann transfer orbit.
You use your large "fixed installation" railguns to fire projectiles
with a spread of velocities (so they all arrive at the same time, but
spread evenly over the target area) at the point where the ships have
to be when they get there. 

The ships can either use up precious delta-V changing course (which
means they\'ll *miss* their destination by *millions* of km) or they can
sit there and hope that nothing hits them.

They can try dodging, then using even more fuel to correct back to the
required vector. But there\'s a limit to how many times they can do
that. Especially since they *have* to reserve enough delta-v to match
orbits with their destination once they get there. 

If you eliminate the "magic" thruster plates, and try to keep the
reaction drives from getting *too* efficient, and folks moving between
planets in the same system are *very* vulnerable to this sort of long
range sniping. 

Sure, most shots will miss. But if even *one* hits, given the closing
velocity of the ship and projectile (likely in the hundreds of km/sec)
you\'ve got *at least* a mission kill. More likely an *actual* kill. 

At ~95 km/sec a one ton projectile releases a kiloton of energy on
impact. Given that the ship is likely moving at 30-40 km/sec, that
means that the mass dtiver has to boost the projectile to ~55-65
km/sec. 

And a one tonne chunk of iron is a sphere 62 cm in diameter. More
likely would be a paraboloid (rounded cone) shape. Spin it to enhance
stability and to help even out the temp. You\'ll actually *want* it to
have a mirror finish, simply because that keeps it cool, and aids in
radar stealth (it reflects the radar away from the receiver). 

Signature would be *very* low. Ships might not be able to detect even
large groups of such projectiles until it was too late. And, as I noted
above, they\'ve got a choice between hoping they aren\'t hit and burning
fuel they need to keep getting stuck in an orbit that won\'t get them
*anywhere* before their life support runs out. Not a good set of choices.

Mas drivers can also be used to bombard planets and orbital facilities
(things that can\'t readily dodge) from *extreme* ranges.

Because at the ranges involved in WWII speed of light lag was
essentially non-existent. 

But in space combat, you have to figure speed of light lag in. *And*
the "flight time" of the projectiles is *much* longer.

At 1 light second, you know where the opponent was 1 second ago. And
even if you are using a laser (which also moves at the speed of light,
just like the radar or whatever you are using to track the guy with)
*another* second will have passed by the time the beam gets there.

That means that you have to aim at where you hope the guy will be in 2
seconds. If he can accelerate at one g, then in 2 seconds the center of
his ship can be *anywhere* in sphere 20 meters across, centered on
where it would have been if he\'d merely coasted (from your viewpoint
the sphere is a bit distorted). 

Now consider something like a *reasonable* railgun projectile. It\'s not
moving anywhere *near* the speed of light. Let\'s be generous and say it
moves at 1000 km/sec. 

That means that it takes 300 seconds to cross 1 light second. That\'s
*five minutes*. At 1 g, in 300 seconds, he can have altered his
position by as much as 450 kilometers. You\'ll only hit him if he
*doesn\'t* manuever, or if you get lucky.

No, see above. The returning pulse tells you where he was one second
ago. It doesn\'t matter that it took a second to get there. And as I
noted, the position changes for a 2 second lag is only 20 meters at 1
g. So if his ship is more than 20 meters in the smallest dimension a
hit is *certain*. If one or more dimensions are smaller than 20 meters,
whether or not you hit depends on *how* he manuevered.

Missiles can correct their aim as they go. If they see that the target
is moving to the left, they can steer to the left. At least until they
run out of fuel. 

Railguns are only useful against targets that can\'t manuever, or at
*very* short ranges. 

I *really* have to write that spaceflight simulator, and then add
combat to it...

First off, I agree with you. My arguments are to help the poor gm that in a
fit of weakness has allowed a Monster in his campaign. (Whether it be a Stat
Monster, Reaction Monster, Skill Monster, or something else.)

>20 points for Merchant(21) ... Admin defaults to Merchant-3 (18 - toss in

>46 points so far, and we have 4 skills at Expert or better.
>Add 12 points in Diplomacy at 16, a token 2 points in Handgun-13, and 5
>points in miscellaneous skills.

Let\'s see. All this make him just shy of 33 years old, with a sum total of
4000 hours\' worth of education by a *master* merchant. (8000 hours of
self-education, or 16000 hours of on the job training. For merchant alone.)
The discrepancies between the time spent on Merchant and time spent on the
other econimics skills seems less than believable from a training point of
view. ("You spent 80 weeks training Merchant full time and *8* on
Accounting?")

Me, I wouldn\'t let this character through. A character that\'s spent ~90% of
his waking hours at fulfilling a single job just isn\'t human. Unless,
perhaps, he bought \'Obsession: Become the Greatest Merchant In The World\'
at -15 points. Or is a robot.

Obvious munchkin material like this one should also, of course, expect a
*lot* less slack (in particular when it comes to defaults and missing
skills) from the gm than a well-designed interesting character. Or maybe the
gm should simply start running combat-heavy adventures for a while. ;-)

>Add a 100 point, available 15- Bodyguard-type Ally (30 points)

Which is - thank god - an NPC. Meaning that it should be played by the GM
and *not* the player. Especially not a player with such obvious munchkinoid
tendencies. (Note that a good explanation would be needed for how such a
studious merchant as this met and *befriended* a Bodyguard-type Ally. I
think the \'wildly different background\' clause at the end of the second
paragraph of B24 applies here. Also, the entire \'GMing the Ally\' section on
B24 is good reading.)

> <real minimaxers buy a 75 point Lawyer as a \'zero cost dependant\' as
well>.

And the GM should then have said character (which is a Friend that appears
on a 9 or less *each session* (B38)) do something legally inappropriate
while \'trying to help\', and be discovered, so the pc must try to get his
\'friend\' out of trouble. This *is* a dependant. Not a free Ally. See the end
of the second paragraph on B38.)

>Add Very Wealthy (30 points), and get Status-1 for free

> (if the GM allows Temp Wealth, go for Temp Filthy Rich and pay for the
Status).

The GM should then note that according to Gurps rules (which should be
played by strictly, when dealing with munchkins. Slack is for roleplayers.
;-) the character spends 40 hours/week maintaining his job. This does *not*
include adventuring. Also, if the character gets \'Wealthy\', \'Very Wealthy\'
job (such as, say, Master Merchant), he\'d only get a fraction of the pay a
\'Very Wealthy\' pc would get. (Somewhat broken rule, I know, but if the
munchin abuses the good parts, he should get hit with the bad parts too...
;-)

>5 quirks and 20 points of disads (Combat Paralysis and a 5 point Enemy

Combat Paralysis? He he he. At least the munchkin leabves the gm a good way
of getting rid of it. ;-) Unlikely in a real munchkin, but still fun. ;-)

>Now, this is a pretty damn gross Economics Monster.

Amen. Which just shows that the *MOST IMPORTANT RULE IN THE BOOK* is the
second paragraph of B177...

So what if a character has a million skills? Many of the harder skills will
be low, and the easier skills will be just above default. I\'m not sure that
I see a problem with a tiny bit of knowledge in a large number of skills.
This doesn\'t unbalance the game at all, especially not Traveller with its
Jack O\' Trades skill. I\'m not sure that I follow why there\'s reason to be
annoyed. The character may have a great number of skills, but the same PC is
a master at none. Big deal...

There are people in real life who know a little bit about a wide number of
skills.

Now, as to the "one-skill Johnny", a good GM can work around this by making
that one skill of limited use or utility... Or, then again maybe the
character is really good with handguns. So what? There are plenty of people
in real life who were or are aces with handguns. In the American Wild West
there were several legendary shootists, Wyatt Earp leaps to mind (most of it
was practice not "experience," before he was involved in the shootout at the
O.K. Corral he was only involved in one shootout, hence a legit starting
character).

They can work also against targets that:

	(D) _Are_ not maneuvering.
	(E) _Can_ not maneuver.
	(F) Don\'t have working sensors.

So if you want to arm your ships to attack only crippled targets, or
lazy ones, go ahead :-)

What I typically see in the arguements against a given technology
being useful is the notion that if it isn\'t a good weapon under
whatever conditions, it isn\'t _ever_ a good weapon. I\'m all in favor
of rules for things like railguns, but military ships (or others
that bother to take any precautions) at higher TLs can defeat them
easily (to the point that they are useless).

I kind of like the idea that you might find (first contact kinda
stuff) a world that has space travel, maybe even jump, but never got
reactionless drives. Give them realistic reaction drives, and
railguns start looking better as weapons. Sure an Imperial Destroyer
might take over the entire star system all by itself, but it\'s a
neat flavor kind of addition.

In the case of railguns (at 4km/s it\'d take 2 hours for a projectile
to reach a target 0.1ls away (1 hex in TNE)) they are not good
weapons for the reasons Dave states. On the other hand, if a low TL
navy decides to attack a higher TL force that is unaware of their
use of these weapons, they might get a single good use with
surprise.

Yeah. I\'m not sure a BigAss(tm) missile (KKM) wouldn\'t be just as
good against these kinds of targets. Put enough armor on it, and PD
lasers have to ablate the sucker away to do any good...

Bullshit. What you are talking about is detecting a small rogue body. At
4km/s, we need to detect it at the distance of about 25 km.

This with starship sensors designed to detect other starships at a range of
several light-seconds.

Then, of course, there are active sensors. Me, I put my trust in firepower,
so my ships tend to go active in combat.

>And, of course the above argument completely misses the fact that

They are ? Even railguns firing large clouds of projectiles ? Care to
design a couple using FFS2 ?

Factor in the power plant providing the power, and then convince me it\'s a
better way of hurting the enemy than lasers or det-laser missiles.

The power demand for 5000 projectiles will be sufficiently high that you

Space is big. Real big. When weapons go out to more than 100 000 km,
combats tend not to have time to become rolling 3D dogfights.

And if they do, then lasers are within cant-miss range, so ships tend to
get their surfaces scrubbed in short order (lasers cant hurt anything
inside a ship with decent armour, but they still do a good sandblasting job
on the surface).

On my web site (http:///u.arizona.edu/~bjohnson/tprogs.html) I have the C
source for a program (sub2ps) that takes in a subsector listing (in it\'s own
format, sadly, different from the archived sector data) and will generate a
PostScript subsector map that looks quite good, publication quality.

I also have a QBasic prgram that chews up the online sector data files and
spits out subsectors in the correct format for this program.

The sub2ps program is pretty standard ANSI C, so it ought to compile on just
about anything.

If you haven\'t got a graphics program that reads PS files (like Illustrator),
or a PostScript printer handy, you can get Ghostscript:

http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/index.html

which is a PostScript interpreter for non-postscript systems, you can print or
view files, even turn them into Adobe Acrobat documents. Versions of
Ghostscript are available for a variety of platforms.

Nifty stuff.

But it is a lot harder to keep track of versions without this. Especially
if you can\'t open the software on your platform. As a result I haven\'t
changed the webpage location for the material I\'m hosting since my site
went up. If you point to Rob Prior\'s software at

http://www.cybergoths.u-net.com/RPS.html

I will keep that URL the only one. I cannot guarantee that version numbers
will not change with the software (eg Andrew M-V\'s Pocket Empires material
at BITS), as in some cases I cannot open the software to read/check the
version as it runs on those 78rpm PC thingees.

>Second:

Would love to, but I can only do Mac Stuff here, and as I host Rob\'s stuff
and run the BITS software side on his behalf I am not exactly unbiased...

Emperor\'s Vehicles is, unfortunately, seriously flawed. Unless you are

p59 of CSC has some plasma cannons, but no autocannons. I\'m afraid the book
is a bad un - if you want I\'m sure we can give you a lowdown on the T4
material worth getting...

Adobe\'s PDF format is what I would recommend. Looks and prints the same

BITS site in the Archive page.

Then click on Archive.

But with the Atari you could use a TOS replacement front end - eg MagicMac,
MagicPC, Gemulator - to emulate an STe on a PC/Mac.... The MagicMac demo
(even the German one) let me use some of Dave Burden\'s Traveller ST

That was my take on the book. But I\'m biased. I believe Marc should have
adopted FFS1 as the definitive tech book. Thou FSS2 wasn\'t bad if you
discount the typos.

In my Universe Formerly known as Traveller, I started with the meta-system in
Gurps Space and added parts from all over.

It can use that as well. I always had problems due to the way it manipulate
the memory. I can send it on if you want. It\'d be about 1Mb-ish though. If
you email me at the address below I\'ll forward it as an attachment.

  Take a leaf from Striker II and switch to CD3, with a retrofit to CA? 

  But seriously:

 A) Drop IR Follow-up rounds.

 B) Laser Designated: possibly change auto-hit to DM +4, which is very
near the same thing. I have to wonder if the "low-power" setting for
spotting lasers is also de-collimated, as otherwise the spotters are
performing an interesting task by automatically hitting a rated target
at ranges for which hit values are already specified for their specific
weapon/fire control combos.
 
  Switching to +4 at least allows some dubious advantages for exposing
a turret only, or being smaller/entrenched/partly concealed, etc.

 C) Operator Guided: assume that the missile attack is affected by the
firing vehicles movement & stabilization (probably already specified,
but I don\'t have S/B:2 handy); further assume that _wire-guided_ tac 
missiles _do_ require the firing vehicle to remain stationary.

  A response to the homing missile issue would require a bit of research;
I have to wonder how credible using a Blowpipe (MP) SAM against an AFV in
ground clutter at 2 km would be in real life.

        Ok.  Fairly high optical signature, yes?  More thrust per joule than
ion-drives, yes?

        That makes brilliant sense.  Once the smaller partner\'s market is
saturated, there\'s no point in shovelling more at it...  send it somewhere
else.  So you get situations of one hi-pop/ hi-TL world driving and feeding
the economies of *several* smaller worlds.  Nice.

        That is what I am doing with mine...  Where I am using "mostly real
star data", I don\'t need random locations, I need random contents of
existing locations.  So, it\'s going to be able to read in a text file
containing either hex numbers or X-Y coords and build planets for that.
It\'ll do planets "blind" and/or randomly fill in locations if you like, too.
Mostly beacuse that is easy to do, programming wise.  =)
        The other thing mine is going to do is "age" a planet...  using my
own set of house rules (very abstracted) a planet will eventually go from
uninhabited to Pop:A StarPort:A, depending on its neighbors.  The other
thing mine will do is record the original die rolls that rendered the
results, so you can "tweak" a planet by modifying the underlying rolls.
        World Builder Deluxe (author\'s name escapes me) seems to be pretty
powerful, but I was already about 50% of the way through mine when he
announced his, so I am going to keep plodding along.  Its alphaware right
now, largely because I am not convinced the database structure won\'t change.
E-mail me privately if you\'d like to see a copy...  The "generate from
location list" function isn\'t working yet, but it is what I am currently
hacking at.

        Hi, Kevin!
        I am using a great RPG CAD program called Campaign Cartographer 2
(CC2) for my mapping work.  I use it both for deckplans as well as my
starmap.  Head to "http://www.profantasy.com" to get info on the product and
my site at "http://www.atlantic-online.ns.ca/traveller" to see some
examples...  the large-scale TNEC map and the "subsector" view of the
"Terra" subsector were done with it, as well as all the starship deckplans.

        Or have the missile capable of jamming the crap out of the CIWS

Ah, FUDGE! Another of my favorites. ;->

Do you use the FUDGE descriptors for tasks?  If so, how do you match
them with the task descriptors in the published Trav material?

How would you feel about the following for some conversion factors
between Traveller and FUDGE...

Two reasons come to mind:

1.  (Operational) They have limited endurance, compared to thruster
plates.

2.  (Canonical) TNE, by removing thruster plates from the available
thrust agencies, violated CT and MT canon.  Any ships designed under CT
or MT were completely invalidated, as the underlying assumption that
thrust was always available, so long as power was available for the
maneuver drive, was removed without (AFAIK) explanation.

I haven\'t played with the templates too much...I really need to sit
down and spend an afternoon doing that.  I was a little perturbed at
the number of points each template used, though, it looked like
there was very little room for customizing if you stayed with 100
point characters.  But like I said, I haven\'t played with them much
yet.

Thanks, Allen.  If people start complaining *too* loudly about posts
on the list, I might take you up on it, but from the responses, it
looks like some of us are interested in discussing it here.

Well, Traveller characters tend to be older than most RPG\'s 18 year olds,
and I\'d kinda assumed the character was in their late forties, and had
spent most of the last 20 years being a Gentleman Trader. Clearly
blackballed by TAS (otherwise, he should have TAS as a starting advantage
<I think it\'s a 10 point Right to Hospitality>). I kinda wanted about 5
points of Reputation, but ran out of points (\'The Marches are a first-rate
place for Third-rate Imperials\').

Hey, I think this is a well-designed interesting character, albeit brutally
optimised. Note that I am not padding out the 40 points of disads with crap
like \'Skinny\', and part of the point of the excersise is to show why we
need more skills for Merchants - mutating Area Knowledge into Commodity
Knowledge <commodity> is an obvious place to start.

I was thinking of the British TV show \'Minder\', where the main character
was a bodyguard for Mr Arthur Daley, a rather disreputable trader. I was
thinking that despite having paid points, the Minder is still drawing a
fairly chunky salary. Which the player has to pay out, each and every
month. I\'m thinking on or about four grand a month (you think everything
he\'s done has been completely legal, huh ? And that anyone looking to get
at him would maybe like to ignore an underpaid, under-appreciated gunsel,
huh ?)

With $1.5 mill in cash and Merchant-21, your job *is* merchant venturing
... if you dont have at least a mill tied up in speculative cargo at any
given time, I dont think you are playing the character right (personally, I
think you need more potential for high-end money in G:T ... when starships

the U.S. Navy, a career ER physician, and currently the chief DMO

Already done, and will be released as soon as I fix an annoying memory

Not the stacks, the operating system.

The Mac OS is copyright Apple, not you, and thus you need the OS license
to run the OS.

You can probably buy the license nowadays, but you _do_ have to purchase
it to stay legal.

The "average" template has a point total of 90 points. It usually has 20
points in disads and no points in Quirks. GURPS characters are usually
allowed 40 points in disadvantages and up to five 1-point Quirks, thus
giving you 25 points extra to spend beyond the ones listed for the
template..plus the fact that characters are balanced at 100 points, so
there\'s an extra 10 too. and 35 points can allow for a pretty fair amount of
customization, IMO. Plus the templates are not inviolate; they can be
altered with the GM\'s permission (or not used at all except as rough
guidelines if you prefer). Obviously, individual templates will vary with
this somewhat. The templates are most useful for reducing the creation time
for characters for people not used to the GURPS system; I use them in GURPS
Traveller to retain some of the "class/profession" based nature of
Traveller.

It\'s just been added to my Library data files. Now Mark, what criteria
do you use to determine who gets it, when do they get it, and how acute
a case they get?

IMTU everyone suffers, some more than others basically based on END.,
poor rolls generally extending the length of the attack. Now they may
find the severity going up as well! My players will love you! (heh,heh).

  Starfire Empires (c.1985?) had a lot of great ideas and detail, not all
of which would be too dated even now. Of course, they weren\'t all playable
without the computer assists that simply weren\'t practical then...

  The rule above also leads very nicely into understandable struggles over
spheres of influence, etc., as a near-satellite can be pretty much counted
on to help beef up your economy rather than that of a potential rivals. Of
course, this also means that attempting to poach off a trade-world can be
interpreted as a casus belli...

  I\'ll bet that the Islands Cluster has a real interesting history.

Sounds similar (though somewhat more severe) to the aftereffects of
Alderson Drive use in Jerry Pournelle\'s CoDominium works.  (In
Pournelle\'s books, the FTL drive [Alderson Drive] has disorienting or
worse effects on both people and elctronics, but the effect is generally
transient without need of medical intervention.)

In my ref\'s TU, _viewing_ Jumpspace can cause similar symptoms in some
cases (I deliberately described my character, a Colonel of Jump
Infantry, as one of these).  The rationale was that the attempt to
reconcile the view of Jumpspace with "normal" human perceptions is
disorienting in many cases, thus leading to the symptoms described
above.

Not necessarily. I\'m a CT freak, and I always assumed that one of the reasons
that the power plant needed so much fuel (1 percent of ship\'s displacement
tonnage per powerplant number) was to provide reaction mass for the manuever
drives. Admittedly I know very little about TNE and am not a gearhead or
techie to boot, but I thought that the thruster plates were where the reaction
took place and where the reaction mass was expelled.... This Heplar-Thruster
plate arguement always confused me, because I thought that the CT manuever
drive used elements of both... Please enlighten me....

Nope.  According to Dave Nilsen various drafts had been finished, but it

I just don\'t see what the US would gain by allowing Texas to secede.  It loses
alot and gains little.  Hostilities tend to be good for economies (it was WWII
that ended the Great Depression, no?).  In addition, all US assets and tax
revenues from Texas are lost.  In addition, other states (particularly
California) would want to do the same and the whole thing would snowball.

That\'s a nice touch.  It would have to be lasting beyond the proximity though,
or as soon as he\'s gone, decisions might be reversed.  This would have to
affect teh cabinet and congress, too, for it to work.  Is this a subconcious
thing or is it willingly controlled?  The answer to that could change the
whole perspective over Adamnson and his ilk.

I just need something more substantive that would allow Texas to secede, the
US to allow it, that doesn\'t bring more than half the other states along w/ it
(to individual independance or a new nation).  Course noone says the USS
Starleaper (or whatever) has to be from the same USA, as is current today (or
c 1977 even), but could be one that is much different.  Maybe the President

I wasn\'t offended.  Maybe i was just seeing it as too obvious a joke, from my

Is a Baron responsible for a "minor" world or does that fact

says a Baron "may" have a fief.  Does that mean

I got some fudge on my Book #1, once.  Didn\'t help any.  Left a little
buttery stain in one corner.  Used to smell nice, but not anymore.  I
don\'t suggest mixing Traveller and fudge on a regular basis.

It was never stated (early on, anyway) that CT drive were
reationless. As I recall, there was a HG rule (1st edition?) that
allowed the use of the drives as if they were a fusion gun (very
Niven like :-)

When I first played traveller back in the late 70s, maybe 1980, I
always assumed they were fusion drives like in Known Space books by
Niven...

As a result, I kinda liked HEPlaR, though I figured for
compatability there shoulda been an even more absurdly efficient
version that gave at least several days endurance under
acceleration.

The 2300 AD timeline presents an indepedent Texas.
Texas is invaded by Mexico, eventually breaks free and refuses to rejoin the

It becomes a spacefaring nation with colonies.

This is more plausible to me than secession, but not by much.

As a Texas History Teacher (yes we exist) I do feel that Texas would have
far too much to lose by leaving the US.   Militaries are expensive, thats
why we have the federal government.
Also, I have a problem with the US letting go of a Nuclear weapon assembly
facility (El Paso) and other major military sites in the state.
Other than loosing Texas to invasion, I can\'t forsee the US letting us go.

Well it could be that all races in the Traveller universe are minor, as
the Droyne may have developed Time Travel first and stole the Jump Drive
off the Solomani.  Then they went back in time and gave it to themselves
before anyone else realised, and fabricated the story surrounding the Coyns.

Make that more than *three* attackers. Three points define a plane. And
regardless of whether or not the target is *in* that plane, it can lay
in a course at right angles to said plane.

Less than 2 cm = max volume of 8 cm^3, thus max mass of 176 grams. At 4
km/s that gives an impact energy of 1.4 Mj. Which is also the energy
required to *launch* it (ignoring losses). About what you\'d get from
300 grams of TNT.

Actually, the impact energy is more apt to be determined by the
velocity of the two ships relative to each other, as that will often be
in the tens or even hundreds of km/sec.

Note the amount of energy required for a 4 km/sec projectile. The
required energy goes up as the *square* of the velocity.

Sure it is. At 4 km/sec, it takes over *two hours* for the projectiles
to cross *one* 30,000 km hex. In that time the ship is likely to be
*anywhere* but where you aimed. And the max *useful* spread on those
projectiles is a lot less than the spread of possible ship positions.

Mind you, if you\'ve got a situation where the ship *isn\'t* going to be
manuevering, then they are in trouble. But that\'s rather a special case.

A lot depends on what vector the firing ship has. Most shots are likely
to be moving at above system escape velocity. But they\'ll be dangerous
for a century or more as they cross the system. Luckily space is *big*
so the odds of running into them are slim.

For what it\'s worth, the Imperial Calendar is actually the "World
Calendar" or the "International Calendar" with the serial numbers filed
off. I\'d have to check my notes to see which it is.

So would I. I\'ve got some old notes, but it would *really* be nice if
someone (Marc Miller, perhaps?) would once and for all set official
date equivalences. 

Though when you get right down to it, the only *real* difference it\'ll
make in the programs is one data statement per calendar. Namely, what
Julian Day number to use as "0" for that calendar.

There\'s no "0BC" or "AD 0" (and yes, AD *is* supposed to go *in front*
of the year). The count goes:

2 BC
1 BC
AD 1
AD 2

Zero wasn\'t invented until *after* the AD system was started.

And the 4713 BC is by the Julian calendar, not the gregorian.  But the
difference between the two isn\'t enough to amount to even a full year
over that time span.

Since the "King Herod" referred to in the New Testament *died* in 4 BC,
the shift *is* in the wrong direction to help you.

Gravity. You are essentially talking about a white dwarf which has had
enough time to cool off (as I recall, the universe isn\'t old enough
yet). 

Figure out the surface gravity for a body that masses the same as the
sun and is (let\'s be generous) 50 miles across. Hint, the gravity at
the "surface" of the sun is around 26 g. And it\'s around 60,000 (or is
it 600,000?) km radius...

The ravioli gun post covered velocities from a few meters a second up
to barely distinguishable from c (they had a section discussing the
effects that would occur when the speed of the projectile exceeded the
speed of light in whatever material the target was made of!).

You probably want to try Tom Bont\'s Astrogator program. It is one of the
most configurable sector mapping programs I have found and does. It can be

Actually, unless a GM is putting them to some specific use that
requires otherwise, there really isn\'t much reason a player can\'t
change them just as much as he/she wants.  They are really just
partially complete sample characters.

They were intended to be fairly complete characters for newbies.
Players with more experience should feel free to modify them.

Because I liked T-plates and dropping them because they were
pseudo-scientific really irritated me, especially when the same game had
handwaved grav pulse laser focusing for lasers, and the V word. I couldn\'t
see why it couldn\'t be possible to keep T Plates on as a technology too.
This was fixed with T4, but remembering the changes in TNE make me go
Grrrr! It was the TNE background (canon) change that most annoyed me. I had
always been influenced by a certain film trilogies Star Destroyers and
YT1300 stock light freighters.

I do like the idea of HEPLaR really; indeed, it gave us some interesting
ideas when writing material for the defunct IG version of the Signal GK
Dagudashaag sourcebook. We had some renegade Interstellar Confederacy
commerce raiders designed, which were really cool. Doug Berry designed them
after a couple of email exchanges, and gave them HEPLaR drives because it
made them pretty distinct from the Imperial ships. TL12 but no T-Plates.
Anyway, the ships were nasties - the inspiration were the Carrier\'s in CJ
Cherryh\'s Alliance/Union universe; they had nasty battle riders and the
main ship was capable of taking quite a pounding too. The Fueler detached
like the Manta in TNE\'s Aurora Clippers. Sadly Doug\'s copy of Excel trashed
the file with them in, but he reckoned that they would take down an
Imperial Coronation Class Battleship (albeit with heavy losses).

Optical sig - I assume so, Bruce or Dave may be able to expand a bit.

Thrust? Yes, a lot higher.

TL7 	Ion drive	0.033 kN/m3
TL11 	T-Plates	400 kN/m3
TL10	HEPLaR	2000 kN/m3

>Now, as to the "one-skill Johnny", a good GM can work around this by making

True. The problem I have with this type of character is the good old
\'mixed-level\' party problem. That is, something that will challenge Johnny
appropriately will *destroy* the others. And, given that Johnny really can\'t
do much else (it\'s usually combat, for some reason ;-) he\'ll be bored
senseless when the others are doing something else.

The first problem can be overcome if everybody (gm and players) agree that
the genre they\'re playing in works like this. I.e., the battlesuited thugs
will attack Johnny *without* spreading explosive submunitions all over the
other players, *and* Johnny will refrain from nuking the unarmed martial
artist that\'s destined to fight the player who also runs an unarmed martial
artist. It\'s just that it\'s a rather fragile balance. (And, for a GM like me
who straddles the Gamist/Simulationist fence, it just doesn\'t feel good.)

The second problem can easily be ignored by the GM. "You should have thought
of that when you designed the character." But *I* (the GM) don\'t like it if
the players are bored. (It happens, but I try to avoid it.) Also, Johnnies
*tend* to (it\'s not always true) to be one-dimensional characters, without
many \'hooks\', meaning that they\'re difficult to entangle in plots. Which
also gets kind of boring for me.

A compromise proposal is that the Solomani invented the jump drive in the
same way the Soviets invented their atomic bomb.

They found out is was possible and got some very good hints, but without
hard work, some brilliance and some very good engineering, then they
wouldnt have got it to work as well as they did.

Well, my players in my PBEM haven\'t got a clue what\'s there.  It\'s never been
defined by me yet IMTU.  Course, IMTU, the Sollies actually got Jump Drive
from the Vilani via a crashed merchie in AD 1947 at a little place called
Roswell, but the Sollies have done a good job of covering it all up.  <grin>
Remember, history is written by the *victors*.

Fiefs may or may not be linked to titles - you may have Admiral James
Arbuthot, Duke Whatsit, who holds a number of fiefs, some as Duke Whatsit
and some as part of the Arbithot family lands (see, they held those
*before* they acquired the Duchy of Whatsit, and it is held under an
independant grant). Fiefs can be inheritable or life-fiefs (\'In recognition
of your Service to Me, Strephon, I hereby grant You, Sir James Arbithot the
Duchy of Whatsit, and Charge You with the responsibility of maintaining My
104th Fleet in a manner fit for War\' ... I dont think the Imperium works
this way, but it\'s a big place with a long history).

The other possibility is multiple fiefs per family, with some of them being
sub-let (?subinfeudated?) to various younger siblings as life-fiefs (you
get it, but your kids dont inherit it). That way, Johnnie Thirdson can be
kept in the style to which he has become accustomed, but without breaking
up the Family Estates. It is kind of expected that Johnny Thirdson will try
to build up an independant asset base out of these revenues, so his kids
arent a drain on the family.

Other possibilities include Imperial Facilities as fiefs (eg you run the
starport), tax rights as fiefs (*thats* why refined fuel costs KCr 1 a
dton) and revenues from blocks of shares.

The other question is what does \'responsible\' mean ... imagine a situation
where a noble is responsible for a world, but the world is not an Imperial
dependancy, and the noble has negligible ownership of assets on the planet,
no role in government and no tax rights. She is Duke of Whatsit, and that
and 2 credits gets her a beer anywhere on the planet. 

However, she is *still* the Duke of Whatsit, and it is expected that she
will be consulted if the Imperium has to make decisions about Whatsit.

Which side of the blanket were they born on ?

If legitimate, I\'d say drop them one Trav Social level, or half a Gurps
level - two and one if illegitimate.

If they are the child of a Baron, call em a Baronet, and toss in a
knighthood (it\'s either \'Baronet Sir Captain James Arbuthot\' or \'Captain
Sir James Arbuthot, Baronet\' ... I cant remember).

The other thing you should do is get a copy of some big, complex family
tree, and pencil some names and jobs in ... if they are the child of a
Baron, they should know that so-and-so, the Regional Veep for Instellarms
is Fluffy\'s cousin, and that such-and-such, the President of X is married
to Bittie.

Aah, but there\'s the rub! Where are his skill points in:
Acting (AKA Lying), Anthropology (\'Know your customers\', he\'s been at it for
20 years, remember?), Armoury (Just an example that assumes he\'s a gun
trader. Substitute/add another half-dozen knowledge skills to reflect the
fact that he should really know something about the stuff he\'s selling...),
Area Knowledge (sector, subsector, several worlds, maybe even some really
interesting regions (where he\'s had adventures)), Bard (AKA Being
Entertaining), Carousing (A merchant that can\'t *party*? Get real.), Detect
Lies (Kind of obvious, innit?), Economics (*Master* merchant, remember?),
Fast-Talk(the very essence of Power Salesmanship), Intelligence Analysis
(Actually, I\'d prefer the one from GT: Far Trader, economic analysis(?), but
that\'s not out yet), Language (depends on region, but I\'d expect at least
two or three), Law (Ok, his lawyer might handle this for him, but that would
just make him a fool. Trust me, I\'ve been there. :-(, Leadership (He *does*
have underlings, doesn\'t he?), Research (or does he have a market department
that does it all for him?), Scrounging (At least if he used to be a free
trader before he struck it rich), Sports (Or any other hobby skills. Did he
*ever* have a life?), Streetwise (If he\'s ever done any, ahem, \'less than
legal\' deals, this is a neccessity.), Writing (Ever written a prospectus to
attract investors?)

And defaults just don\'t cut it. After all, a default implies that he hasn\'t
actually spent any noticeable amounts of *time* on it... (I could probably
be talked into a half-point in most of the above, but not all.)

Oh, btw, the above is pretty much the skills I\'d expect a successful
Merchant to have, give or take a few. As a *minimum* I\'d expect him to come
*very* close to matching the Merchant template on GT75.

Or, to paraphrase Dr Kromm (SJG\'s Gurps Guru), in Gurps being an expert does
not mean super-high skill-levels, it means lots of breadth.1

Oh, he\'s not an outright munchkin. He just displays severe munchkinoid
tendencies. I\'m certain that with the right player he could be an
interesting addition to the party, given his monomaniacal tendencies. ;-)

Oh, I agree. You just triggered one of my Disadvantages. ;-)
Also, I think I came up with some pretty good workarounds above. Recently,
SJG\'s \'policy\' has been that one should always try to \'reuse\' old skills and
advantages rather than come up with even more. I tend to agree. At least to
the point that I always *try* to use existing ones first.

Hmm. Sounds interesting. I think it would be more fun if the \'Minder\' was
the pc and the merchant the NPC dependent though. Or if *both* were pc\'s.
(I\'ve actually played a character similar to the \'Minder\' once, it was fun.)

about right.

True. But I (and most bosses, come to think of it ;-) tend to go by the
guideline "If it\'s fun, it ain\'t work. Stop laughing and get to work!"
Remember Catbert, the Evil HR Director? So, that should be 40 hours of
mind-numbingly boring administration/management/beancounting on *top* of all
the fun adventuring stuff that he really doesn\'t have time to do, for the
tax papers have to be in by tomorrow morning at the latest, and he has a
stack of TASJ Form 342345 *this* high to deal with before noon, and... Oh
yeah, sleep would be nice too. And perhaps even some r&r? And, of course, if
he gets behind on his accounting, well, that\'s an "Adventure Opportunity",

Captain Sir James Arbuthot, Bart.  The "Sir" is treated as if it were part
of the name, so any military, medical, or other title will go before it
(Major Sir Thomas, Doctor Sir Francis, or Professor Sir Aethelbeohrt).  And
the "Bart" goes at the end.

Hate to have to admit this 8), but I\'m not sure exactly how Brit rules go -
I believe the child of a Baron is "The Honourable..." and the child of any
higher titled noble is "Lord ..." or "Lady ..." - no other titles, unless
they earn them on their own, though the eldest son may use one of Daddy\'s
lesser titles as a "courtesy" title; thus, the children of the Marquis of
Snowdon are David, Viscount Linley, and Lady Sarah Chatto.

Merrick\'s right.

The early days of CT used some form of reaction drive. Check out the art
in the early Journals - full of ships riding pillars of flame into the
sky. 

The High Guard rule was that fighters could use their drive as a fusion
gun of the same strength as their acceleration. They did this by riding in
close (letting teh defensive guns get a shot at them, then brakng _hard_.
This was a dandy tactic, and the best way if using fighters to damage an
enemy ship, as otherwise the strongest battery a fighter could mount was
2-3. In fact, I designed several fighters without weapons, just 6G drives!

IIRC, it was MT that made reactionless thrusters canon.

OK, a Marquis (I like like the title of Marquis better than Count) is
responsible for one "large & important world" correct...  IMTU, that is the
main world in any system...  So Regina in the Spinward Marches would have a
Marquis in charge of it...

Now Barons on the other hand may or may not have a fief....  If a Baron is
an "Honorary" Baron meaning he or she might have gotten this noble rank say
because of military, scout or merchant services...  Also the rank of Baron
may be given to Merc Commanders, where the Merc Unit is the fief...  As for
other forms of fiefs, I would have to say that a Baron on a main world my
be in charge of a large area such as a continent(sp) or the world\'s moon or
a minor planet in a system.  For example IMTU, Terra is ruled by a Marquis,
but Mars is ruled by a Baron who is under the count & on Terra, North
America, South America, Europe, Nothern Africa, Southern Africa, Russia,
China, SE Asia, India, & Austraila are all ruled by Barons who are under
the Marquis...  As for Barons without fiefs, well those people do have the
title of Baron & the rank of Baron, but are not part of the Imperial Moot,
but also are in line for a fief...  If one opens up where for some reason
there are no heirs...

Think about it, you have a PC who is a Baron without a fief...  A fief
opens up for rule & his or her name is at the top of the list...  But, the
fief is in the Solomani Rim & he or she is in the Spinward Marches...  So
it can be a race to get him or her there in time...  A great way to play a
champaign...

> A child of a noble, who doesn\'t inherit a title, is still a
> noble, called what?  Does he/she have the same status as
> his/her parent?

No, but he or she is at a much lower rank...  If the parent is say a
Marquis, then the child is a Baron & placed on the list to get a fief... 
If the parent is a Baron, then the child is a Lord...  And, no he does not
have the same status as the parent, but a slightly lower one...  But, also
can rise higher than the parent...

Btw, would someone comment on these thoughts, so I can know how on-base or
off-base I am...

Maybe Pulto has the remains of Walt Disney there?  It could also be a place

Would this be a reasonable thing to switch on/off under user control?

How much cargo before a Cargo Master is recommended?  Would there be more

Would carriers have a flight control officer on the bridge? Other

	True. But a course at right angles to the plane does not necessarily
mean it\'ll be at right angles to the line of sight from each of the
attackers, which was what I was talking about. Evading at right
angles to the line of sight maximizes the offset from the "ballistic"
point, which is the ideal situation. With two attackers you can do
it. With three, except for some special cases, you can\'t.

Yeah, I wouldn\'t support it in the Real World either, and I don\'t really
care if it happens or not in the TU, but if it amuses some people, and
there\'s a decent pseudo-explanation, why not?

IMTU, the US would have had some mishaps in international relations as
well, like some poorly judged military involvements (eg Vietnam, Somalia,
etc), and/or worsening of relations with historical allies (perhaps
including Australia - I\'ve got some fairly well-defined ideas for Australia
IMTU that are almost certainly different from those of anyone else on the
list!).  It would also be in a deep crisis of political leadership, with
the tradition parties in disarray.

The end result of all this would be turmoil in the US threatening to blow
the whole place up.  ("this" being the economic, diplomatic and political
crises).

In other words, the US, at least temporarily, goes down the Russian road.

First, who is "the US"?  Is it the grunts who would have to fight a civil
war, or the politicians that would send them?  Maybe the "elites" are
keener to keep Texas in the Union BY FORCE than ordinary people, even if
"ordinary people" don\'t support the secession as such.  This would be
particularly likely if the US government is seen as incompetent and
corrupt.

In other words, "ordinary Americans" might not be too thrilled about
fighting other "ordinary Americans", irrespective of high-falutin\'
arguments about the economy.

Add some organisation, and the "peace movement" becomes a threat to the US
government. 

Hostilities tend to be good for economies as long as the economies in
question aren\'t the ones being bombed....

Other states might not want to do the same if the secession is widely
perceived as an incredibly stupid idea.  Alternatively, the secessionist
movement is strongest in Texas, and only exists to a far lesser degree in
other states.  Perhaps, the government is afraid that leaning on Texas
would only result in anti-government elements gaining strength in other
states, or would bog down into guerilla warfare.

Well, I suspect it would be the same US - it just may be a bit battered and
bruised.  It may have had other secessions, or authoritarian governments,
or simply may have almost collapsed into revolution, or all of the above,
but somehow it scraped through.  The details of that story should be mostly
up to the individual referee, but it should be an interesting, complex,
sometimes tragic, and sometimes heroic story, just like US history in the
past.

The thing to remember with future histories is:  there\'s likely to be as
much "history" in the future as there has been in the past. That is, as
much weird stuff is going to happen in the 21st century as happened in the
19th or 20th.

My only beef with this line is that it would be a bit obscure in ten years
time!  Sometime later this year I will have been playing Traveller for
twenty years, and who knows how long I\'ll be playing it in the future? 
This Timeline is good stuff, and I will probably use it and keep using it
until it
gets significantly overwritten by Marc or someone "authorised". 

My only mild complaints about the Timeline are:  
I still can\'t quite see a "Sino-Australian" bloc being called the "Western
League".  Sure, it\'s at the western end of the Pacific, but it still would
require a very serious shift in the way people tend to see the world.  OK,
it may be a Pacific-oriented, rather than Atlantic-oriented world, but I
still can\'t see the term coming into use.  Of course, the Timeline itself
has picked it up from Prometheus Rising, so I guess it\'s up to Andrew to
decide if he wants to keep it.
 
I\'m also not quite sure about the "Sino-Australian" bloc itself.  I was, of
course, the original big-mouth who proposed that Australia would turn its
face north.  That was mostly because I had the ideas for what would happen
in Australia that I referred to above.  Unfortunately China isn\'t really
part of them!  

Perhaps what it actually is, is an alliance between incompatible partners
against the US, rather than a coherent bloc in itself.  That is, there is
China, and its allies, and Australia, and its allies, and maybe some
others, held together mainly by expediency.  That of course is not
necessarily how the rest of the world sees it.

Yes, that\'s it, IMTU.  I can fudge it - it\'s not a problem.  Cool!  

Sorry for thinking out loud.  I actually deleted most of it.  None of what
I wrote above should be taken as anything other than IMTU.

The point is that the framework we have is, and should be, flexible enough
to cope with lots of differences of interpretation.  It works with my
interpretations, which are pretty extreme in some cases.  How does it go
for everyone else?

Troop Unit: The ship can carry 20 troopers in regular occupancy, an additional
20 can be carried in the bunk section (usually under influence of Fast Drug,
to minimize discomfort for week-long interstellar trips).  If troop commander
and Ship XO are willing to share staterooms, 2 additional troopers can be
carried.   The 10 low berths are primarily used for transport of critically
wounded troops or prisoners, but can be used to carry 10 extra troops if
needed.  Likewise 4 could be squeezed into the sick bay.    So a unit of 20
can be comfortably carried, a maximum of 56 could be squeezed in.  If troop
unit and ships crew are integrated, then the Gunners, Steward, Small Craft
Crew and one of the medics can make up an additional reserve squad of 11 men.

Notes: The Mercenary Transport is meant to deliver a small unit of mercenary
troops and their equipment to other worlds.   The vessel itself can land and
off-load all troops and equipment or troops and equipment can be ferried down
by ship\'s vehicles.  The Imperial transpod COP-7 can land 20 troops at a time
and has fair armor protection (Armor 20 in Ground Combat rating) and is the
principal hot-zone troop lander.  The Slow Boat carries up to 6 passengers and
10 displacement tons of cargo and is usually used to land the unit\'s vehicles
and heavy equipment, furthermore the boat\'s cargo hold is used to supplement
the Transports 35 tons of cargo space.
	The missile batteries and sand casters give the Transport moderate combat
ability, but the vessel is not meant to engage enemy vessels offensively.  The
missile launchers are often used as fire support for the troop unit on the
ground, often the missiles are outfitted with laser-designated guidance
systems to allow troops to call in fire accurately.

Nice idea, but based on wrong assumption: Jamming means flooding the area

In fact jamming does give away your position. You are talking about CLOAKING

If Texas would succeed form the Union i could see several other states
following them...  

Such as:  California, New Mexico, Arizonia, and possbility Nevada and Utah.
This is since the South-West has become the location of the modern
successionist sentiment of today.  To many stupid laws have been pasted that
have started to rob individuals of their property rights (making it illegal to
farm and use your property as you want just because of some stupid rat is
living in the dirt) and the right to defend them selfs from predators (making
it illegal to kill wild wolves that are killing your cattle, other domestic
animals, and possiblity your own little children).  to many in the US this is
seen as an abtursive federal government, and should be replaced with something
more like what we started out our little experiment with (an extremely limited
Federal Power instead of one trying to get into our lives on every level).

as for those of you who do not like the idea of succession, you should
remember that many of us southerners (espeically us North Carolinians) didnt
want to succeed either until the Union ordered us to form an army and declare
war on the rest of the South BEFORE fireing on Fort Sumter. 

 I DO NOT want to see the USA fall apart, and as a former member of the US
Navy, i swore an oath to defend the US Consititution form its enemies both
foreign and DOMESTIC just like every other US Miltiary Man and Woman.  

And the dissolution of the US would be a major assault on the Consititution,
but i DO NOT see the US Military getting invoulved in a Civil War this time.
There are way to many varibles invouled (no uneducated immergrants to fill the
swelling ranks of the US Army this time), but i do see the US Government
maybee calling on the UN to send in peacekeeprs to stop the successionist form
succeeding in their Bid for Independance. 

But I do think that governmental powers should be exersised more on the local
level than the federal level without fear of federal reprisals (like with
TEXAS when the speed and drinking age limits where forced on them since the
Feds told them they pass it or they would not get any Federal funds to keep
the FEDERAL HIGHWAYS up and running).

Currently, there are many highly intelligent people that have started to
discuss the possiblity of another civil war in american based on regional and
ethnic lines due to the Politics of Excuslionism and Factionalism that has
been supported since the 60\'s by race baiters and others who benifit form
keeping ALL Americans factionalised (and this is possiblity happing in other
countries as well).  

But a GRAND REPUBLIC OF TEXAS might be more possible that many realise if the
Federal Government dose something really STUPID that violates the Thrust that
the common citizen has with the Federal government, like outlaw the ownership
of private fire arms OR push through the ANTI-Hording Laws making it illegal
for common citizens to stockpile FOOD, Ammo, and other goods for their use in
case of an emergency (this law is currently undergoing a rewrite so it will
even effect the mormans and their practice of keeping between 1 to 3 years of
food onhand).  

So the possiblity of a modern War of Succession is a possiblity, as ugly as it
is, we must recognise and admit is possible.

OK, an alternative: Most web server systems these days run on an
OS that allows you to establish what are called "links" on Unix -
and I think "aliases" on the Mac work essentially the same way.
In essence, they\'re an entry in the directory to a file that has
another directory elsewhere in the file system.  If you provide
such a link without the version number, it would be just as good
- - if you keep that link updated.  Which would really be no more
difficult than keeping a web page updated, but eliminates the
need to update the web page, as the Web page can keep the
unchanging alias, while you use the versioned filename for
maintenance purposes.  I do know it\'s a lot easier to create or
change a UNIX link or a Mac alias than it is to update a web
page...

If people are resistant to doing this, then I\'mm going to have to
ask that you all make an effort to notify me when a Computer
Connection program gets updated, so I can update _my_ web pages.

I\'ve seen three different ways of handling a Traveller magazine
that I\'d call successful - certainly, none of the magazines
failed because of what they did; it seems to me that it was
always outside pressures that closed them down.

The first one was, naturally, the original Journal of the
Travellers\' Aid Society.  This magazine had a primary focus item
for each issue, and contained other useful items as well - short
adventures, new equipment, alien races, animals, NPCs, and so on.
Lots of stuff, very nice to have.

The next was the Travellers\' Digest, from DGP.  This was built
around an ongoing adventure, and recounted that adventure as its
central feature.  This was then used as a framework to hang other
things on - the same sorts of things that JTAS had, but all tied
in to the central adventure.  Great reading, and provided more
context for the material than JTAS.  Major disadvantage - _they_
ran the adventure, not you.  It was like a multi-installment
version of "Raconteur\'s Rest" in Freelance Traveller.

The third was the MegaTraveller Journal.  In a sense, this was a
"Travellers\' Digest in miniature"; each issue had a complete
adventure, and used that central adventure to hang supplemental
information from.  The major difference is that MTJ adventures
were ready for you to run, like Freelance Traveller\'s "Active
Measures", rather than a serialized story, like "Raconteur\'s
Rest".

All three have their benefits, and all three fit into slightly
different niches. (Just out of curiosity: which style was Sword
of the Knight\'s Traveller Chronicle done in?)  I\'d like to see a
T5-focussed magazine; I\'d be willing to try to write for it.
Which format should it be in?  Or should there be three
magazines, one in each format?

I await what I hope will be a lively and interesting debate.

The issue is not so much the mechanics of thruster plate technology, but
the shortening of ships\' legs.  In CT, ships had an "essentially
unlimited number of accelerations (at least 288)" [B2, pg 6].  Page 1 of
B2 indicates that "transit times to a point at least 100 planetary
diameters out adds a total of approximately 20 hours to the whole
trip."  Page 1 also states that "constant acceleration, turnaround, and
constant deceleration are assumed."  Based on 10 minute space combat
turns (B2, pg 22], we have at least 48 hours of combat maneuver (288/6),
_in addition to_ at least 20 hours of routine acceleration.  There is no
indication in Book 2 that greater G-numbers affect the duration of
acceleration available.

From HG:  "Fuel consumption for maneuver drives is inconsequential, and
is assumed to be part of the power plant operation, _regardless of the
degree of maneuver undertaken_."  [emphasis added]

Most TNE ship designs I\'ve seen on the Web have 20-60 G-turns of
maneuver fuel.  _Much_ shorter legs, wouldn\'t you agree?   Since I don\'t
have the TNE equivalent of the BROADSWORD Mercenary Cruiser, let\'s
assume that it has 75 G-turns of fuel.  That means that, at 3G
acceleration, the TNE Merc Cruiser has only 25 turns of acceleration
before dipping into Jump fuel.  OTOH, my good old Book 2 Type C can
easily maneuver for 48 _hours_, plus have at least 20 hours left for
routine operations.  The upscale HG variant has _four weeks_ of
acceleration (minus a week or so set aside for Jump space power plant
operations).

I think it\'s the International Calendar you\'re thinking of; I
know that the World Calendar had explicit months - 13 of them,
with 28 days each, and "World Day" at the end of the year.  Plus
the intercalary "Leap Day" between the sixth and seventh months.
But even the International Calendar with the serial numbers filed
off isn\'t the Imperial Calendar; the IC would have had an
accommodation for the intercalary day, which the Imperial
Calendar doesn\'t.

Well, yes.  Although my first cut at the program (I have it
around somewhere) actually used "Julian minutes" rather than
Julian days, to simplify somewhat the calculations against the
varying day lengths.

In the 80\'s SJG\'s did a lot of little \'cardstock figures\' for various
systems.  IIRC, there are also Fantasy and Champions "Super Hero" ones.
I\'ve not seen the Traveller ones, but IIRC the ones I saw were fairly well
done.  They were quite simular to the ones found in the FASA boxed sets of
traveller deckplans.

It was always my belief that a province was an area about the size of a Sector

No flames Rich, I know you too well.
BUT, the truth is, a modern war of Succession is pretty far fetched.  I am
familiar with several movements of that nature here in Texas and despite
being scary, they ARE STUPID.
Take the Ok. City bombing.  Just the way for successionist to make a

an attack.

The average person is not going to revolt due to losing his right to own a
gun. I know, I own guns, don\'t want to give them up, but if a law should get

But that is enough.

It\'d be interesting to know who ;-) I don\'t remember it being me...

I would disagree with the _stuck in M0_ mode - personally my love is the
M:1100 stuff; however CORE (ie the product development group) was focused
on supporting T4/T4.1 This all went apart at the beginning of 98 when IG
(spit) went under. We had a lot of work go down the tubes. I like M0 but
until IG went under the work for Traveller was focused on T4/T4.1.

If you look at BITS products (not the CORE stuff for IG) you may notice
that there are 7 101 books (Lifeforms, Cargos, Plots, Travellers,
Governments, Religions, Rendezvous) which are all generic all mileux
supplements albeit built around the T4 ruleset. But this makes them easily
accessable to CT/MT and to a lesser extent TNE/GT. Aside from that we have
Rob Prior\'s software (IGS2 all Milieux, QSDS/Infini-V are T4, GT Shipyard
is GURPS Trav), Tim Collinson\'s Traveller Bibliography (generic) and The
Long Way Home (M0 because it was written to support the launch of T4 in the
UK).

Of the other products - The Dag book is SGK re-worked and may end up as an
M0 sector book and a M1100 Encyclopedia (not sure exactly how this goes),
most of the scenarios are not M0 linked (only Valentine\'s Rose, Web of
Deceit and Space Dogs are). ACQ is CT/MT/T4 useable, and 101st Spaceborne
is usable for a variety of TL 9/10, 12 and 14 so is equally applicable to
CT era as M0.

That is the reason I disagree with being stuck in an _M0 rut_ ; if my posts
have given the impression that we dislike M1100 that isn\'t the aim. We have
to support the current edition of Traveller and in this case the companies
and personnel involved were aiming at M0. Now I know some people dislike
the focus of M0 but the scenarios/material we were working on (the
expansion into Dag etc) would have given a better flavour went when IG
failed. Unfortunately, M0 will always be stained by IG.

That\'s fine - my favourite Traveller setting is _Hard Times_, then the

Nope. I noticed it - the question is whether Marc noticed it. He is the one
looking for a publisher, and owner of the rights. As I mentioned in an
earlier post I agree with your idea. I\'d be interested in Marc\'s feedback
on these thoughts but I suspect that it could be awkward for him being
drawn into this thread. Bear in mind that I run T4.1/T5 demos for BITS at
cons on a semi -regular basis...

I want a simplified (HG level) design system (ie more simple than QSDS) as
the basis for T5. I would like it to have more flexibilty in the sense that
HePLAR/other drives are included and G rating limits are dropped, and the
no of hard points limit becomes a number of surface area points total. I
use HG still with the T5 draft rules, and I use Rob Prior\'s QSDS software
to design ships for T4 scenarios.

It felt like an evolution of CT to me, but not CT. And I\'d love to see the
old adventures updated and re-issued as a starter. For a start GDW\'s late
70\'s early 80\'s standards of layout beat IG big time.

AS FOR Ok City bombing. too much evidence is coming up about that to make that
agaisnt the Milita and States Rights movement.  The OK State Attorney\'s
General has reopened the case and is trying to figure out why there are way to
may discrepancies with the evidence.

But i too know of groups of Men and Women who are part of the milita movement,
they are high educated, and motivated people (of all colours, backgrounds, and
beleifs) that have seen the BOGUS crap going on.

Further more, I DO NOT KNOW OF ANY AMERICAN SOLDIERS who would follow the
orders to FIRE ON THEIR FELLOW AMERICAN CITIZENS...  They would desert before
they took up arms agasint fellow american defending their consitutional

possible Grand Republic of Texas.

do not be blind to the Varibles are out there.   TO many americans are sheep
today, but those sheep can become lions over night.  Look at the outrage over
WACO.  How well do you think UNCONSITUTIONAL laws (that the police personal i
have discussed this with would refuse to enforce) that will lead to the
REMOVAL of ALL of the other RIGHTS garanteed by the Consitution?  too many
rural communities are getting the short end of the stick today.  but we really
need to learn to wake up and get the Career politicians out of Washington and
replace them with someone willing to make the Tough choices (such as getting
the budgets balanced, cutbacks on the social spending, getting the governmetns
out of our private lives)...  

Until then its not a pretty picture.

I\'m working on the climate part of it. I\'ll do what I can on

done. Also, I\'ll put in a few suggestions about tying them into a
community.

  Chinese and Korean, Buddhist and Hindu holy days are based on a
lunar calendar like Easter and the Jewish holy days. As you
observe, the particular lunar calendar in use may have become
divorced from the actual movements of the moon, but whatever
rules are used assure that the event occurs once per year in the
appropriate season of earth\'s northern hemisphere.
   On planets with different cycles, this seasonal connection
will disappear, and the rules for determining the dates of such
holy days will seem _completely_ arbitrary.

   TNE suggests a standard period of 4 hours for work, travel, or
sleep. (8 hour night\'s sleep, 8 hour work day, for instance, are
multiples). In ancient times, the day and night were each divided
into three watches. The Romans divided each watch into fourths of
one hour each. 
   Why not have the scout services, when they measure the sol of
a world in standard hours, round to the nearest integer divisible
by four, and divide the sol into that many chrons. This would
make a chron approximately one standard hour in length, but
variable depending on the world.
   Humans are adapted to a 24 chron world: Worlds with 20 chron
sols would seem awkwardly short, and worlds with 28 chron solds
would seem awkwardly long. Worlds with more or fewer chrons per
sol might have day/night cycles out of phase with human
sleep/rest cycles.

Or use a convention, something like a "month" is 30 days. A
common unit in financial reporting might be a quarter of 91 days
(or 92 days, if the fourth quarter).

IIRC, Domestication of sheep and goats occurred in the fringes of
Mesopotamia around 10,000 BC, give or take a couple of thousand years, and
human with domesticated cattle populations took a while to build.
I\'m not convinced that overgrazing works as the primary desertifier of the
Sahara. I\'m not up on the lastest research, but I seem to recall reading
that the period of satellite observation coincided with an extended
drought. Drought plus overgrazing could easily plunge an already marginal
area into full desert. If you brink back the rain and stop overgrazing, the
area might well start to recover.

Global weather patterns and thus precipitation would be determined
primarily by radiation received, location of major bodies of water, and
location and altitude of land. I don\'t think plants normally transpire more
water than they recieve in precipitation. Soil type has the same kind of
mutual interdependence on plant life that transpiration does. Since there
are often three or four biomes that can fit in a climate zone (Designer\'s
choice) and much overlap of biomes between neigboring climate zones, trying
to detail transpiration and soil effects at this scale goes into the
category of more complication without much more realism.

Let me do it the other way around: Climate zones, with the biomes that are
usually found in them.

Mean annual Temperature (degrees C)
 Below -15 Polar
- -15 to -5  Arctic-Alpine
- -5 to   5  Cold Temperate

 Above 25  Tropical

Mean annual Precipitation (cm)
  50 or below  Arid
  50 to 100     Dry
  100 to 200    Moderate
  200 to 300    Humid
  300 to 400    Wet

  Any           Wet Soil (Discontinuous or seasonal areas of 
                shallow water)

Temperature/ Rainfall combinations not listed do not exist, since the

This is what we basically have _now_.
OK, we\'ve also got Deep Space 1\'s ion drive.but that don\'t make a hell
of a lot of difference.

The rail guns we have could easily make a mess of the USS Iowa , let
alone the weak little spaceships we\'re running around in.

Well, a noble is the Imperial representative to a world.  For an
adventurer, it raises the question about whether they can be traipsing
around the galaxy rather than staying at the world they are supposedly
responsbile for.  For this character, the main question is whether
you can inheret the title of Baron without having to have such
responsibilities.

        Hi, Andreas!
        Umm, not sure what your quals are, so I might be argueing with
someone who knows better.  However, I\'m a Combat Information Operator in the
Canadian Naval Reserve, and have been jammed quite sucessfully on several
occasions by American Intruder-E\'s.  We saw \'em coming, right up to the
point they turned on the music.

        There are several different kinds of RADAR jamming.  These are:
        Deception Jamming....  "I am here, here, here, here, here, here and
here too.  Guess which one is me."
        Racket Jamming.......  "Why is that 10-degree-wide bearing on my
scope suddenly full of sea clutter?"
        Lobe Jamming (Racket variant) .... "Why are those 3 10-degree-wide
bearings on cope suddenly full of sea clutter?"
        White Jamming ....  "Why did that entire 30-degree arc of my scope
go soild green?"
        Black Jamming ....  "Where did *everything* on the screen go?  All
my contacts just went away!"

        Since I am not sure how classified the different techniques are,
that\'s about as detailed as I am gonna go.  Suffice to say that 6
Intruder-E\'s white jammed us to the point the .50 cal crews got to have a go
at them as they "for excercise" rained 500-lb iron bombs on us...  Cocky
buggers didn\'t even bother with stand-offs, they *knew* we couldn\'t get a
fire control lock onto them.
        
        Now, the EW boys were 8freaking* the entire time, any they could
tells us what bearing the jammers were *on*, so the GDO-Visual was able to
have all the eye-targeted systems pointing the right way, but we could not
direct Sea Sparrow or 3"50 gun fire at them.  30mm Bofors (eye-targeted) and
.50 cal was all we had.  Talk about "Point Defense".

        So, in our Traveller KK missile attack, the launch ship fires a
salvo of 100-g missiles at the target and then snaps on the jammer and
"whites out" the bearing the missiles are screaming down.  It only has to
last a few minutes.

All the cases where you don\'t have a fief were ones where the
person was awarded the title.  I take it you think that if you
inherit the title it would have to have a fief?

A few comments.  The Imperial Encylopedia from MT says that
a Marquis is in charge of a "large in important world" with
a "good starport".  This says to me that the are only in
charge of the more important main worlds.  This raises the
question of who gets assigned to backwater worlds?  Barons?
Nobody?

Also, it says that all Barons are member of the moot.

The draft timeline had some skirmishes occurring - I have no problem with
that.  What I see as happening is that political pressure "from below"
prevented them from escalating.

UN peacekeepers?  Mmm, no, I don\'t think that they would be sent in "to
stop the [secessionists from] succeeding in their Bid for Independance". 
That\'s not what "peacekeepers" do, theoretically.  I also can\'t see a US
government that\'s concerned about a loss of sovereign territory bringing in
outsiders to resolve an internal dispute.  Maybe after a settlement has
been reached, though.

Damn.  Why am I getting involved in this?  I\'m not even American, and I can
live with "what happens" in my part of the world.  That\'s it - this is my
last post on the topic.  All you guys can work out/blow up your own country

True.

Since we\'re talking about time travel:

How do you create a pocket universe?  Are you "removing" it from space,
time or space-time?  Probably it\'s the latter.  Is Yaskoydray\'s pocket
universe something like the TARDIS from Doctor Who - a time machine that\'s
bigger on the inside than the outside.

How were Yaskoydray\'s children interfering with his projects?  Was THEIR
time travel turning reality into mush?  Did he have to destroy them to
preserve the time line?

Were they actually his children or where they created by his time
manipulations?

Did  the Empress Wave phenomenon "create" the GT alternate universe, in
place of the MT/TNE universe?

Was it a time-travelling Avery who tipped off Strephon about Dulinor\'s
plot?

See, I said it was naughty.

        What is the "Empress Wave"...  something TNE, or what?  I\'m a CT

Wait a second. He has Economics at something gross (it defaults on Merchant).

We have 20 points of \'free\' disad space, and 5 points of unassigned
background skills (a doubled point of Sports Law (Polo), a doubled point in
AK (Polo, Spinward Marches), two points in Vacc Suit and a doubled point in
Literature). Now, for PCs, a full 40 points of disads is de rigeur.

Diplomacy is used rather than Fast Talk, and I\'m not sure of the difference
between Economics and Economic Analysis/Intelligence Analysis.

OK. Half a dozen one point AKs (all at 11), couple of points in Research
(12), couple of points in Writing (12). Four points in Streetwise (13) and
one point in Leadership (11) is 15 extra points, so we buy another 15
points of Disads (say, a 5 point Enemy, a 5 point Addiction and, I dunno, 5
point worth of Curious)

Departments that I could count on.  For instance, I enjoyed the Amber
Zone because it took no time to jump in and could (most often) be run

Traveller and High Passage you had to read the setting, etc. in order
to use the material.  Also, as a writer, submission of articles is
easier.  Features might be commissioned, but Amber Zone or Beastiary
articles can come from multiple sources without needing to be linked
to the main theme.

I am going to stick my neck out here, and though I may get back a
bloody stump, I must tell that my favorite (for format and looks, not
content) is the resurected JTAS (#25 & #26).

It appears that Traveller Chronicle used types one and two at various
times.

Michel,

Jamming and EW equipment for Bruce\'s DSR are in FFS2. Basically, an active
jammer costs double, uses double power and takes up 1/10th the area, while
a passive jammer costs 5x, takes up 20x the power and uses up half the area.

100 G missiles are an artifact of the CT missile supplement. You just cant
build anything that fast under any other design system. Drop it to 10 gees
and I dont have a problem.

Firstly, the example you are using is half a dozen first-line state of the
art EW aircraft jamming one Canadian Naval Reserve ship. In Traveller
terms, you were a TL7 (possibly TL6) vessel being jammed by a bunch of TL8
jammers. Frankly, I\'d be worried if you werent effectivly blinded.

Secondly, anything that fast in Traveller is probably using Heplar, and you
dont need to use active sensors to spot anything spouting jets of
almost-fusing hydrogen (thruster plates cost MCr1 per 1600 kilonewtons -
Heplar costs KCr 80 for 1600 kN, plus a single fusion plant <KCr200 at
TL13>). Check out the probably passive signal of a 10 gee missile - passive
decoys disguise the signal by fac 1 (FFS2, p74), while anything putting out
10 gees of Heplar is at ?+1.0? under the DSR (the only thing hotter in the
neighbourhood would be the local star).

Given this, I dont think jamming the active systems would count - we could
get a LIDAR lock on the active missiles as soon as they boosted (2 million
km LIDARS are about MCr 10 at TL13), then all we need to do is retain the
LIDAR lock, and pick them off with lasers or counter-missile fire.

Now, you might be able to use a sandcaster on the nose of your missile to
spoof LIDARs, but that is pushing your mass up, making you more vulnerable
to area nukes in a point defense role.

No...  Well maybe if you\'re assuming time travel here.  There are rumors that
the EW might make an appearance in GT.  Rumors that\'s all.

The EW was the reason the real Strephon wasn\'t at Capital when Dulinor
assassinated his double.

The EW is a psionic / psychic phenomenon eminating from the Galactic Center, travelling outwards
at the speed of light.  There are a number of theories on what the EW does to people and a great
number of discussions on it in the TNE side of thing.  Basically it seems to "change" the patterns
of people (include all aliens in this) and possible awaken their latent psionic potential.  The
most dramatic effects of the wave seem to follow some 50+ years after the initial wave front.
What happens "back there" is anyone\'s guess.  In TNE the Zhodani Consulate appears to be coming
appart at the seams.  In MT the LongBow stations out in the Vargr Extents all seem to go offline
after the wave front passes over them.  This could be because INI is utilizing psionics at these
stations in their observations of the Zhodani core expeditions.

Please note that this has nothing to do with the "Sparklers" or "Baddies to the Core" both of whom
were officially invalidated by the Regency Sourcebook.

There\'s plenty more thoughts on what this is or what it means but the basic thing that goes along
with the wave front is a vision of a woman standing in front of a burning city (IIRC) attempting
to communicate something to the person who receives the vision.

The Wave appears to have had dramatic effects upon the Consulate but little noticable effect on
the Extents.  My theory is the Wave\'s effects are most noticable on "Static" rather than "Dynamic"
socities.  Thus, the Zho\'s and the Vilani would be hardest hit, while the kinds of changes the EW
brings about would be virtually un-noticed  in the Vargr extents, as things are in a constant
state of flux there.

The Intruder-E is not the same thing as an EA-6B.  The A-6E is/was the
latest generation of the A-6 which dates back to the mid-60\'s.  Big
differance in EW capability.

In Reavers\' Deep, you\'ll find the Union of Harmony, the Lanyard Colonies, and 
a few other Solomani client states.  The Harmonies were ethnic Asians who 
believed in \'Solomani purity\' and \'Solomani supremacy\'.  Fun people.  They 
would have gotten involved in the Solomani-sponsored commerce raiding in 
Daibei, Reavers\' Deep, & Dark Nebula, but they were too busy doing a brushfire 
war with the Aslans to Spinward, the Duchy of Marlheim to Core, and the 
Confederacy of Duncinae to Trailing.

The Lanyard Colonies of Horste (RD 1937), Lanyard (RD 1938), Ceytle (RD 2037), 
and Morgan (RD 2038) were nominally Sollie client states, but they tended to 
only pay lip service to \'The Cause\'.  The Purity League is a radical Sollie 
client state at the Rim/Trailing corner of the Deep, a totalitarian religious 
dictatorship who allowed Sollie commerce raiders to base there in exchange for 
technological support.

Yeah, but that brings us into the stormy waters of \'Just what is a point

Inn Sewer Ants? Dat related to Echo-Gnomics? ;-)

But seriously, if anyone requested it, I\'d set it up as a semi-patron that
provides *one* service. Making sure people realize that they\'d better not
mess with this character. The points would give a +1 per \'level\' on reaction
rolls in potential combat situations where the opponents could realize that
the character is a \'made man.\' It would also give an *extra* reaction roll
whenever someone is about to kill the character if he\'s helpless for some
reason. Reasons to buy it could include: Being a Made Man (in the Mob, that
is.) Being a child/close friend of someone who has his own navy, and few
scruples. I doubt I\'d let anyone *legal* sell that kind of service. There
should probably be a few different versions of the disad (Ranging from
"Killer Will Get A Contract Put Out On Him" at x2 cost, through "Killer Will
Get A Bounty On His Head" at x1 cost, to "Killer Will Get Bad Publicity" at
x1/2 cost) and odds people have heard of the organization in question (15-

I took just a bit more.  Economics is the main theories behind macro and
micro economics, how things work.

Things like monetary & Fiscal policy, Government and the Economy (I can\'t
believe I remember them, probably too evil to forget) cover different areas
in lots of detail.
They would probably fall under Economic analysis.

Plenty of surface area, I\'ll admit [46,720.51m^2 used, 25,805.99m^2
spare].  The main reason this ship is Wedge configuration is that I
converted it from a High Guard design I did, and wedges in HG are more
resistant to meson gun fire.  I\'l admit that other configurations would
be more efficient (since T4 doesn\'t include configuration bonuses vs.
meson gun fire), but I wanted to keep this ship as close to the original
as possible.

Besides, I _like_ Wedge configuration warships....

If you recall, I asked the TML denizens about this issue.  The most

with sufficient thruster plates to achieve escape velocity; however,
belly-landing ships will need a _very_ long runway without C-G."

I based that figure on Bruce Alan Macintosh\'s combat system, in which

Unfortunately, I wasn\'t able to mount a more powerful weapon while
maintaining J4/6G performance, and having the ship resonably proof
against its own weapon class (that was deliberate).  I\'ll consider
up-gunning the follow-on BALTIMORE class.

I haven\'t yet, but most of my designs are paired PAW and meson gun
classes.  Next week (after I finish typing them as text files) I\'ll post
the BROOKLYN (meson) and ST. LOUIS (PAW) classes of light cruisers, both
TL 13, and both on essentially identical hulls.

The missile bays are primarily designed as secondary batteries to whomp
the tar out of DDs escorting the enemy cruisers.  However, I can see
mounting 8 missile bays with area nukes (for defensive purposes),
leaving 16 bays for DD killing.

Derek Stanley has explained it well.

The bit I was working off was that the details about what happens behind it
doesn\'t really seem that official, although I may have missed something
from GT.  In other words, there *could* be a time-related phenomenon there.

I guess while we\'re explaining, I\'ll do this one too:
"Was it a time-travelling Avery who tipped off Strephon about Dulinor\'s
plot?"

Avery was the son of Strephon and (posthumously) Empress Iolanthe, born
during the Rebellion from frozen ova that had been removed from Iolanthe in
her youth.  He was genetically engineered for psionic capabilities, and
conditioned to study the Empress Wave.

Strephon sent him to the Regency with the AHL class cruiser Arrival
Vengeance, in the scenario of that name.  There he grew up, married Norris\'
female clone/daughter (and heir) Seldrian, and fathered Caranda, later to
become Regent (and "legitimate" heir to the Imperial throne!).  Eventually,
he wandered off to coreward on an expedition to study the Empress Wave,
which was starting to get close to the Regency border.  His fate is
unknown.

Although my speculations were throw-away silliness, they\'re not actually
that dumb (by Star Trek standards!), and I may even use them...

Historically, here in the U.S., soldiers have already fired on civilians.
Kent State is one example. There was another time back in the twenties or
thirties as well, IIRC. I\'d have to look it up again though.

    'body' => 'OK. This is something that has been floating around in my brain for a
while. Essentially, it is an attempt to do a scalable social map for a
chunk of the Third Imperium. The basic version is for a world, but it can
be upscaled for Subsector, Sector and Imperial level.

If we can computerise it, it could be really, really cool.

****************************************************************************
******

Step One : Determine World Importance

The Base Rank of a world is equal to the World\'s basic importance - halve
the world\'s population, add a the Starport modifier (+2 for A, +1 for B, -1
for D, -2 for E, -4 for X), and add one-third (round up) of the TL-10.

Base rank works on the same O1-O9 system as the rest of Traveller. The only
exception is the title of Planetary Head of Government, which is socially
determined and independant of the career and rank of the holder.

Step Two : Determine Personell and Rank

Each world will have a Planetary Head of Government, a Planetary Navy head,
a Planetary Army head and a Ranking Planetary Corporate Tycoon. The Head of
Government is Base Rank + 1, everyone else is Base Rank.

Each world will have a Rank +1 Imperial Representitive, (2d-9) Imperial
Personell and a Base Admiral, a Scout Base Chief and a TAS Bureau Head if
these facilities exist. The Imperial Personell represent either
quasi-Imperial Non Government Organisations (for example, the Imperial
equivalent of The Wilderness Society or the Sierra Club) or attached
members of Imperial bureaucracies.

Each Megacorp (yup, all 13 of them) rolls for a Presence on the world,
trying to roll World Importance or less on 2 dice. Megacorporations will
have a Major presence (and a base rank rep) if they make this roll. If they
miss by less than 3, then they have a Minor presence (and a base rank - 1
dice rank rep). If they miss by 3 or more, they have an Incidental
presence, and a base rank- 2 dice rep. If a megacorp rep is rank 0 or less,
there is no rep for that Megacorp on that world.

<Named Sector- and and subsector-level corporations would also roll at this
point. Note that the rank of each Megacorp rep is a damn good indicator of
a Megacorp\'s interest in that world>

If there is a Naval Base, the Naval Base Commander is Rank Six or Base
Rank, whatever is higher. If the Naval Base is a Depot, the Depot Commander
is Rank Eight.

If there is a Scout Base, the Scout Base commander is always Rank Five.

Step Three : Determine Career and Age of personell

A person\'s career is rolled on this table (Government includes all non-Navy
Imperial Reps)

Government		Corporate	Navy/Scout/Army
	
2 Noble			Noble		Noble		
3 Diplomat		Diplomat	Diplomat	
4 Bureaucrat		Bureaucrat	Bureaucrat	
5 Bureaucrat		Bureaucrat	Navy/Scout/Army
6 Noble			Merchant	Navy/Scout/Army
7 Noble			Merchant	Navy/Scout/Army
8 Merchant		Merchant	Navy/Scout/Army
9 Bureaucrat		Bureaucrat	Navy/Scout/Army
10 Navy 		Bureaucrat	Navy/Scout/Army
11 Diplomat		Merchant	Navy/Scout/Army
12 Merchant		Merchant	Navy/Scout/Army

A person\'s age will be eighteen plus the minimum number of terms neccessary
to achieve their rank, plus 2 dice, minus three. In the case of nobles,
they are 18 plus 2 dice terms, regardless of rank.

Now, note that you know the rank, age and career of the person, so you
could now fully generate them as an NPC. Or at least give them a name (can
anyone on the Trav Lang list recommend a good random naming program for
Traveller ?).

Step 4 : Create Social Links

Imperial society is permeated by links of families, factions and cliques.
For simplicity, I am going to refer to any such grouping at a subsector
level as a \'family\', regardless of actual kinship links (or lack thereof).

Each level of Imperial society has a maximum of 15 such groups, some larger
than others. A subsector Family will have a two-thirds chance of
affiliation with a random sector-level Clan. Each sector-level Clan has a
two-thirds chance of affiliation with an Imperial-level Clique.

Heads of Planetary government will be affiliated with a random family half
the time.

Other members of a Planetary government have a fifty percent chance of
belonging to the same Family as the Head of Government, a one-third chance
of being unaffiliated and a one in six chance of being a member of a random
family.

Imperial or Megacorporate representitives have a two-thirds chance of
belonging to a random family.

Step Five : Add in Subsector level personell

Numbered Fleet commanders are Navy O8s. 

Each megacorp has a Subsector Head of (highest rank for that megacorp in
that sector + 1). 

Each subsector has a ranking noble, of rank O5.

Step Six : Create Social Conflicts

Roll a reaction roll for every Family against every other Family. Note any
really good or really bad reactions.

Step Seven : Sector level

Add in Sector level personell, the same way as Subsector personell were
added, but one rank higher.

Roll for Family affiliation to Clans.

Step Eight : Imperial Level

Add in Imperial level personell, the same way as Sector personell level
were added, but one rank higher.

Roll for Clan affiliation to Cliques.

Also, a number of ships ignored the maximum armour rule, resulting in 
ships having densities greater than 15 tonnes/kL (in other words, 
they mass more than a solid block of armour of the same displacement 
[improved superdense? :) ] ).

        You are right, Cliff...  particularly what would be an *unpopular*
war.  In Traveller, this is probably the single biggest reason for the
creation of Mercenary units...  Organizations that want an army, but
otherwise can\'t get the criteria in place (other than bullion ;).

Some early thoughts:

Major religions
Political organisations (eg Solomani Party, Ine Givar)

Modifiers for organisations that are expanding or withdrawing from a
particular area.  EG: Oberlindes Lines is expanding into Aramis subsector. 
Roll with additional -2 DM for presence on a particular world.

Expansion downwards to planetary government level.  Eg:  What
parties/factions/cliques are in world government?  Who are their leaders? 
Admittedly, this stuff doesn\'t scale as well as the higher level stuff, as
it\'s more tied to the peculiarities of the world.  At this level you really
need the expanded world gen stuff from World Builders Handbook and similar.
 Then you could go down to mayors, and major landowners....  This is
perhaps going a little overboard at this point.

Popular support.  This refers to political groups, religions and
corporations that are engaged in competition.  Essentially there should be
a base level of support, plus modifiers for actual levels, rolled as
required.  

Examples:
What proportion of the poolball fruit market does Makhidkarun have?  Err,
(roll, roll) 43%.  It\'s biggest competitor is Tukera Fruit, with 22%.  
Who won the last election on this world?  Umm, the Democratic Solomani
Party got 54%, but were overthrown in a coup.  

This procedure could also be used when faction leaders have large support
(but unspecified) support bases.  We can work out how the Dukes will vote,
but what about the Barons? 

Very interesting work!  Keep it up!

Well, the thing that could prevent that is requiring Texas to _pay_ for those
US assets it is taking away... How many Airbases, National parks, etc are in Texas?

Also, there would be _lots_ of other states willing to jump through hoops
(like signing no-secession compacts) to gain all those shares of Govt.
contracts that various Texas corporations have and will lose upon
secession...now, let me see, _how_ much business did Texas Instruments do with
the Pentagon last year??? ;-)

In the end, it would end up making little economic sense to secede.

Plus, if the US is locked in a three-way trade war of death, what happens to
the newly Independent Republic of Texas? You think they\'re just going to be
left alone by the big powers? HAH! They\'d end up ground to economic dust in
the middle of that trade war. Some citizens would get really, really wealthy,
and within 5 or 10 years, most of the economy would be owned by overseas
investors of one side or the other. There would be a proxy economic war fought
there, and you really wouldn\'t want to be there. It would end up looking like
the worst of Cyberpunk scenarios...

        I can do this for you, if you like....  It\'ll be a while before I
can get to it...  Still working on four other programs simulatenously, so I
don\'t want to overload myself.  I figure I could have an alpha ready in
mid-Feb if that is OK....
        I could use it for my TNEC game, so its worth me doing it.

cubic meter and by definition one ton (1000 kg) per displacement ton,
almost everything will use the mass scale.  Extremely bulky items like
non-retractable antenna arrays might still get billed by volume.  What
this does is give you significantly more elbow room for most items and
allows you to put the heavy things in convenient shipping crates without
losing volume to the crate material.

As  an example, say you want to ship a car that masses 2.3 tonnes but
displaces 1 ton.  You\'d pay for and get 2.3 tons of space to store the
car, thus leaving plenty of room to maneuver around beside it.  Now,
let\'s say you\'re shipping computers, nice TL 12 jobs.  At 8 kL (~0.6 dT)
each and 1600 kg, you\'d again pay on the mass scale.  Thus about 65% of
the packed volume would be packing material and crating, plus a little
maneuvering space to walk around.

Yes, I think the Romans commonly used these as well as spacing and
letter substitution codes (alphabet shift initially, then numbers for
letters and the like).

Continuing on codes, crypto and related issues :-
TL 3 : industrial revolution --? Code pads (sender and receiver have
synchronised rolling ciphers).
TL 4 : 1850\'s - 1920\'s. Morse code. Number and group theory.
TL 5 : 1920\'s - end WW2 -> Enigma and similar multi codewheel
scrambling. Microdots.
TL 6 : to the end of the 60\'s -> information theory, computer based
encryption decryption.
TL 7 : \'public key\' systems ; early steganography (hiding messages in
plain view e.g. embedded messages in graphic and WP files).
TL 8 : electronic watermarking, PGP
TL 9 : entangled qubits? Hiding information in \'noise\'? (chaotic
generators or attractors as messages or keys?).

Any other suggestions would be welcomed.

The crypto and computer rating concepts from \'Central Supply Catalog\'
(in GURPS from quite early on - sigh) might be a starting point for
useful T5 rules.....

Yeah, Jeff\'s a friend of mine and a player in my last TNE campaign. The

Looking at mine Id say its the Print of a Scan or Copy of the Original,
but not a Photocopy itself. Its ISBN btw: 3-89505-001-6, but as only 200
were produced (mine is 073, who are my neighbors?) id say your best chance
is ordering it from the shop mentioned before on this list.

The price is a bit steep, but consider what the original books would cost
you if you had to buy them now. That, and it looks a lot better than the
books themselves.

  For a moment I thought that you were talking about "normal" technocracy

"Free speech" is not banned, but innovation is cafefully controlled
and violence is banned. And just about every crime is punishable by

Well, the problem with doing thing with MPP systems, is that the science and
practice of \'parallel-izing\' problems isn\'t very adavanced, compared to say,
TL-12 systems. The diminishing returns you speak of are with extant compilers,
optimizers and OS\'es. While there is always a point where throwing more
processors, memory and HD space at a problem won\'t speed it up, we\'ve seemed
to avoid that so far ;-) 

(OTOH, throwing more processor, memory and HD space at a problem CAN slow it
down...witness <insert favorite extant OS to bash here>)

Concrete specifications on computers in Trav have always been vague. About the
only example I can grab off hand is from T4, which states that the very best
parallel processing computers at TL-7 have a comp rating of 1. This would be
something like a Conenctions Machine, or a high end Cray. The Intel Nuclear
Monster at Sandia is probably a 1.5 or close to a 2. The next line in the book
talks about TL-12 personal computers _starting_ at 2.

Doesn\'t quantum mechanics have this sort of thing happen all  the
time  on  the  subatomic  level  level?  Matter  and  energy  are
\'borrowed\' for a time and then vanish.  Also, this is as good  an
explanation as any for the existance  of  the  universe  ...  the
ultimate volation of the law of Conservation of Matter/Energy!

None of these weapons appeared in the original Black Box Traveller.  They
were introduced in Book 4: Mercenary.

In T4, they are in Emperor\'s Arsenal.  Augmented BD is in Central Supply
Catalog, and in various versions in EA.  

I guess T4 was just following the pattern in CT.  It\'s a bit of a ripoff
for people who just bought T4 and didn\'t want to load up on lots of
supplements though.

You could try Jon Tuffley (author of Full Thrust and owner of GZG) at

According to FF&S, I never bought FF&S2, they can be anysize at the designer\'s
specifications.

Based on size and range, anywhere from to 0.0001MW to 1000GW, its really up to you,
they\'re customizable so that the Meson gun you install in your Far Trader has different
spec\'s than the Meson Gun in a Vorshielef(?).

Don\'t know...

Beam Pointer, targeting computer, that\'s about it.  Oh ya, point the ship in the right
direction.  8^)

> Ranges ?

Again dependent upon the damage, size, and power input.  Could be 0.0001 of a hex or 80
hexes.

> Control systems needed? (crew, computers etc)

Again dependent upon the size and TL of the weapon.  A TL15 100MW meson weapon will
require a smaller crew than a TL12 100MW weapon.  Truely massive spinal or deep meson
sites can require a crew of 100\'s...

> Thanks again if you know of anything I forgot to ask.

I realize that\'s not much help but unfortunately it\'s the truth.  Antti on the TNE-RCES
list built a spreadsheet for building TNE starship, the relic builder version of the sheet
includes the TNE starship weapon construction pages.

I never really saw much of a use for the LAG, it\'s heavy, has brutal recoil, doesn\'t do a
whole hell of a lot of damage in comparison to it\'s size and has a pitiful magazine
capacity.  All in all it\'d get dumped by any military force in a hurry.

Build a 10mm gauss rifle, does more damage, less recoil, weighs less and can rip holes
through light battle dress at anything under 200meters.

If you have V&V and S&A then you have all of them.  These were the Digest
Group Alien Modules, and that is all they produced before getting out of
(or being forced out of) the Traveller line.  The only \'Alien\' book that
was also published was Flaming Eye, which was an adventure for V&V, of
which I happen to own a spare copy.

I thought that the range of weapons in the main T4 book were about the same as
the ones given in the original Traveller LBB. (T4 has Laser pistol instead of
carbine, LBB has more blades, T4 has snub pistol P003 instead of autopistol,
but otherwise about the same range.)  So I kind of expected to see the LAG in
Emperor\'s arsenal, where the Gauss and Plasma weapons do show up (Fusion guns
presumably aren\'t  invented in Mileau 0, nor were the found in Second Imperium
records, nor projected by Mil 0 futurists, so they don\'t appear)  but it isn\'t
there, the LAG shows up in GURPS, but that doesn\'t help me.

Obviously, this depends on the Traveller system you\'re using.  In High
Guard, 2d edition, the first meson guns appear at TL-11.  The USP A
spinal mount requires 5000 dt, 500 energy points, and costs 10,000 MCr. 
USB B takes up 8000 dt of space, uses 600 energy points, and costs
12,000 MCr.

(Translation:  There is no game but Traveller, and High Guard is its
message.)

Well, Steve Jackson Games did go through some financial trouble recently
from which the Traveller line is helping them recover.  I don\'t think they were
in any danger of collapse before that, though.

I think the thing about GURPS is that it\'s never quite reached that critical
mass of players such that it\'s played everywhere that gaming goes on.
Thus you get areas where it\'s popular and areas where it isn\'t.  Around
here (Baltimore-Washington area in the eastern US) GURPS has been
pretty popular for years and it tends to sell well.  I\'m aware of other regions
where that\'s less true.

For microdots you need pretty advanced photography, but codewheels and

You can\'t have computer based decryption without a computer, of course,

Hmmm. I wonder if \'public key\' systems can be adapted to manual encryption

encryption.

Doctor Kylor Dukagen of the Rhylanor Institute of Socio-History has 
announced a leave of absence from the Institute in the wake of his
ground-breaking, popular release of _Unicorn Rising: A Frontier Comes
of Age in the Second Millenium_. This scholarly work has made Dr.
Dukagen well-known in intellectual circles throughout the Domain of Deneb, 
but this new popular release, edited andannotated with the general public in 
mind, has made his name a familiar one from Corridor to the Zhodani border.

According to a spokesperson of the Institute, Dr. Dukagen will be using his
leave of absence to undertake a lecture tour of all the subsector capitols
and other selected worlds within the Spinward Marches. The doctor hopes,
sources said, to take advantage of these personal appearances to "further
develop his work against the broad mosaic of cultures and peoples that make up our domain of the Imperium".
  
Rumor has it that the Sector Duke at Regina was particularly taken by the
ideas presented in the work, and intends invite Dr. Dukagen to stay at length
at the sector capitol, perhaps with an offer of an advisory position. The
book\'s signature phrase of unity, "all of us together behind the claw", has
already been heard in communiques and government addresses on both Rhylanor and Regina.
  
Doctor Dukagen\'s exact itinerary has not been made public at this time.
  
  
Doctor Kylor Dukagen. Scientist, 6 terms. Age 50 Human Male,
homeworld Regina
458CE9  Admin-2, Computer-2, Grav-1, Vacc Suit-1 
Cr150000, Imperial Science Union Member, Pocket Computer
  
Doctor Dukagen is a tall, dark-haired man, his hair slowly turning salt and
pepper with advancing age. He is usually more adept with computer records 
and libraries than he is with people, but is slowly growing into his newfound
popularity. He is currently travelling between major worlds of the Spinward
Marches on a combination lecture tour and sociological research trip.
  
Doctor Dukagen has never in his life been in a life-or-death situation. While
not especially cowardly, his first response to such a situation would almost
certainly be either flight or freezing with panic. His approach to any conflict
situation of a non-violent nature is to talk things out in a reasonable fashion, 
based on his world-view that people can always find common ground.
  
The good doctor is an avid collector of space exploration memorabilia, and
loves to spend time on starliners buying drinks for talkative members and
ex-members of the IISS. Note that he is smart enough to recognize most
tall tales when he hears them, but may continue buying drinks if the teller
is entertaining enough.
  
Plot hooks:
1. Dr. Kylor Dukagen is a cousin of noted journalist Enli Iddukagan (see
JTAS #22). This somewhat questionable reporter may try to attach himself
to his cousin\'s group, so as to try and gain advantage of Dr. Dukagen\'s
newfound fame. Enli will attempt to gain access to information and areas
not open to the public, with the players (and the Doctor) caught in the
middle.
2. Dr. Dukagen is carrying with him a piece from his space exploration
memorabilia collection, an old scout\'s logbook. He intends to present it to
a correspondent of his, a curator of a museum along his route. Unknown to
Dr. Dukagen, the logbook contains jump coordinates for a derelict starship
of unusual design. An assistant of the curator has determined the 
information exists from a scanned copy of the log, but needs the 
original...and wants to get it before the curator gets it into the well-secured 
museum.
3. As #2, but the information leads to a series of Imperial deep-space
refuelling sites - the knowledge of which would prove damaging to the 
Imperium, both diplomatically and militarily. The assistant curator is a spy 
for a  foriegn power.
4. Dr. Dukagen\'s message of unity has been irritating to a radical group on
a planet along his route. A small group of dissidents will attempt to harass
him upon his arrival, and will look for methods of delaying, embarrassing
and even blackmailing him to interfere with his personal appearances.
5. As #4, but the dissidents will attempt to kidnap him, offering his safe
return in exchange for his reading a prepared statement to the media - 
which he will refuse to do. It will not even occur to him to later recant the
statement, or that people will ignore it as being given under duress.
6. As #5, but the dissidents will attempt to publicly assassinate Dr. 
Dukagen for anti-imperial purposes.
  
In all cases, the players could be friends, travelling companions or 
simply people he bought drinks for in a starport or shipboard tavern.

    'body' => 'There has been some discussion off and on about what constitutes a
dispersed hull structure (a la High Guard and later Traveller construction
rules) in GURPS Traveller\'s component ship design system.

It occured to me today that GURPS Vehicles would say that a dispersed
structure -- essentially a framework of structural members to which
individual components are attached -- would be a hull with the "open frame
armor" option, per VE2, p. 23. This saves considerable weight (and
therefore expense) at the cost of less protection for the components
themselves. 

The difficulty is, this rule can\'t simply be applied directly to the armor
weight and cost. Open frame armor cannot be sealed, and so all the
habitable parts of such a ship would have to be armored separately, under
the component armor option (VE2, p. 27) -- this involves broadening the
existing rule on sealed hulls (p. 24) to components, but I don\'t think this
is unreasonable. 

Using this approach requires calculating in detail the volume (and thus
surface area) of each separate sealed section, and then applying armor to
it. I propose the following simpified "house rule" for your consideration;
although it is inaccurate, I don\'t believe it is any more so than the
rounded off values for surface area already in the GT hull chart.

"Dispersed Structure: Starships that are never intended to enter an
atmosphere may reduce the weight of their armor by substituting open
framework for the hull over the unpressurized portions of the ship. 

"First choose the DR of the hull and determine weight normally (p. GT152).
Calculate the reduction in weight by first dividing the ship\'s internal
spaces into pressurized and unpressurized sections. Divide the number of
spaces allocated to the unpressurized section by the total number of
internal spaces; multiply the total hull weight by this figure to arrive at
the fraction of the hull weight over unpressurized sections. Multiply this
weight by 80% and subtract the result from the total hull weight. Calculate
price normally, based on the reduced total weight.

"Open frame armor protects normally against collisions, but provides only a
2-in-6 chance of protecting against contact missiles and no protection at
all against beam weapons or explosions."

Dispersed structures are most useful at lower tech levels (to save weight)
and for LASH freighters and battlerider tenders, where unpressurized
vehicle bays (volume-based) may be more efficient than external cradles
(weight-based) for carrying very heavy riders.

  There will immense economic (competitive) pressure to charge by volume,
as that\'s how ship design (and cost) is figured. FWIW, a 2-Dt AFV can
easily mass from 10 to 35+ tonnes; the IM APC is _600,000_ kilos, but only
12-Dt, IIRC.

You could also run a world along the lines of  The  Village  from
the Prisoner TV series.  (There is even a  GURPS Prisoner  book!)
Free speech/thought is  not  banned  _directly_,  but  indirectly
through mind-games aimed at  eradicating  social  non-conformity.
Free enterprise is allowed, and radicals are tolerated for a time
but closely monitored and channeled.  A high-tech, high-pop world
could develop a repressive _culture_ regardless of its government
structure (even a \'democracy\').  And  repressive  governments  do
not automatically mean low standard of living.

You can maintain just about anything as long as you have the stomach to

people with regularity.   Say for instance your repressive regime is 
backed up
by armed robots absolutely loyal to the planetary government.  If you 
have
"censor" computers watching all communications and robots to do the 
dirty
work, then resistence might be really diffficult.   You would have to 
pay huge
rewards to the workers and inventors who maintained the system to ensure
theuir loyalty, but everyone else might be in deep trouble.

Thanks for your responses. It\'s getting hard for me to keep coming up 
with explanations for all of these worlds. It\'s hard to keep falling 
back on "the old Government was overthrown and a religious 
dictatorship/totalitarian state put up in it\'s place.
From both of your posts it kind of looks like these societies are 
capable of maintaining the status quo, but I would think that they would 
be pretty stagnant culturally and technologically. This brings up 
another question. How did they achieve such high tech levels to begin 
with? The only immediate solution I see is to import technology from 
neighbor worlds and slowly integrate it into their own society. Thoughts 
from the rest of the list? If I\'m reading both of your posts correctly, 
the scientists and philosophers are going to be the first ones shipped 
off for "reeducation".

Meson Guns are TL11 weapons that get gradually more efficient (meson
screens are TL12).

The designers of FFS2 forgot to put in a minimum length or diameter, so you
can buy the Famile Spofulam Meson Gunnette as part of the Barbie\'s Own
Battledress line of Small High Energy Toys.

Their range is a function of their length, and they have the usual
accumulator banks and beam pointer of a particle-beam weapon. Their
diameter is defined by their output.

I\'d say there is some fairly chunky radiation shielding and whatnot, and I
really like the idea of them putting out heaps and heaps of magnetic
induction, ionisation and so on.

Starship meson guns tend to be very long, as you basically need a meter of
length per 1000 km of range and a square meter of cross-section per hundred
megajoules of output.

Power requirements is this usual 5 megajoules of input per megajoule of
output.

Toss in a beam pointer to aim it and a Indirect Fire Direction Center to
let you use skeet shoot for Grav Tanks from the other side of your local
mountain range or planetoid and you have your Meson Gun.

Crewing is one per couple of hundred cubic meters of tunnel, depending on
how good your linked computer system is.

I am not sure if this item was ever produced.  The Traveller Imperial
Navy Flight Jacket was solicited by Chessex around May of 1997.  IIRC it
was to be about $129.95 & was to be size L or XL only.  It was a
synthetic (nylon?) type zip up flight jacket with an Imperial Starburst
on the back.  I do not recall color [er colour] etc.  (I did not pay
much attention at the time since I wear a Medium.)  Chessex was having
some financial difficulties at the time so they did not end up producing
everything they solicited for & may not have produced it depending on
the size of the orders they received.  In 1998 Chessex & the Armoury
merged to form Alliance so if anyone would know if this product is still
available or was ever done it should be Alliance.  I would suggest
having your FLGS ask Alliance.  Marc Miller might know if it was ever
produced since I assume it was liscensed from him.

Umm, how about scientists, engineers, philosophers and artists are part of
a privileged group, while the "robot technicians" and peasants are the
groups subject to repression.  That is, the privileged group live very
well, and even are quite free to live as they wish, as long as they support
the status quo and/or keep their mouths shut.  

This is of course the standard pattern followed by probably about 90% of
the authoritarian governments that have ever existed.

In most of the other cases, most of the intellectuals may have been
supporters of the old regime, and may be subject to purges.  This will
freeze intellectual development for a while, at least until they are
replaced.

Alternatively, the intelligentsia may have been dynamic in the past, but
have since become paralysed by the system.  Examples of this could include
China and Japan in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries, or Europe
slightly earlier.  Europe had a couple of centuries of endemic war and a
series of revolutions before it threw off the paralysing effects of the
previous orthodoxies.  These societies will be apparently stagnant, but may
have the seeds of something new within them.

One reason is T4 is base TL12, and plasma, fusion and gauss weapons were
bleeding edge technology.  Those weapons appeared in EA.

Remember, Gauss, fusion et al waited until Book 4 in CT.

The earliest substitution ciphers are Caesar ciphers after Julius

TL2: multiple substition ciphers (ie early Vigneirre(sp) ciphers) where
multiple cipher alphabets are used in some pattern to encode the plain
text. Invisible ink (a form of steganography), while possible at
earlier levels seems to have been discovered at this level. Also
transposition ciphers (where the letters are unchanged, but the order
is scrambled according to some rule or rules) appear. And in
Elizabethan times, "nomenclators" appear. These are the first
proto-codes. Inside cipher messages "code words" are used to refer to
specific persons, countries, and occasionally objects. 

Thus deciphering a message would get you:

Makes things harder...

> TL 3 : industrial revolution --? Code pads (sender and receiver have
> synchronised rolling ciphers).

Thomas Jefferson (yse, the one who wrote the Declaration of
Indpendence) invented the first mechanical encryption device. It was
ignored and later *re-invented* for use in WWII and Korea! It consisted
of a series of disk (identified by numbers) each of which had a
scrambled alphbet printed on the rim. The "key" was a list of which
disks were to be used and in what order. You strung them on a threaded
rod, placed a washer on each end and used wingnuts to hold them in
place. To encipher a message you turned the disks until the plain text
was reproduced in a line running the length of the cylinder. You then
picked one of the 25 *other* lines of text running along the cylinder
and sent that. At the other end, they turned their disks until the
ciphertext was reproduced, and then looked to see which of the other 25
rows made sense. That was the plain text. 

If the message was too long to fit on one row, you
enciphered/deciphered the message in chunks. It was a great "tactical"
level cipher device. Easy to build and use, and secure enough to be
safe for a reasonable length of time. The advent of computers killed
it. 

The first *true* codes probably appeared in this period. These are
where each end has a list of words and phrases with a multi-letter or
number "group" that is to represent the word or phrase. The receiver
has a list of the code groups with the phrases written out after them. 

Codes are *much* harder to crack than ciphers. But computers have
pretty much killed them too.

> TL 4 : 1850\'s - 1920\'s. Morse code. Number and group theory.

Decryption becomes formalized. Most countries not only have departments
devoted to breaking enemy codes and ciphers, but they have begun to be
*systematic* in the breaking of ciphers.

We also get the typewriter, teletype and the fax in this period (the
fax predates the telephone!). Teletype (TTY) and typewriters lead to
mechanical encryption devices (ie you merely type in the plain text and
out comes the cipher text, and vice-versa). 

The enigma type devices were actually products of *this* period. They
just took a while to become common.

Crypto theory becomes well developed, and is first made public at the
end of this period (Yardley\'s book about the "American Black Chamber").

Steganography hits its first peak. Messages are hidden as moves in
games of postal chess, as tiny dots or pinpricks over letters in
newsclippings, newspapers or books.

Enigma is TL 4. Voice scrambling is is a TL5 developement. So is TV. 
Microdots *may* be TL4. 

One time code pads probably arise at this time.

TL5. Stuff declassified in the last 10 years show both the US and

bitwise ciphering.

Early *computer* steganography. Steganography has been around since
someone shaved a messenger\'s head, tattooed the message on his scalp
and sent him off on a long trip. By the time he got anywhere dangerous,
his hair had grown out and the message was hidden unless you looked
*really* carefully. Then at the destination, his head would be shaved
again and the message read. If it was *really* secret, he\'d be killed.
And of course, he was carrying a normal but innocent messagge as well.

Well, I\'ve given what was actually *occuring* in real history at
various times. And keep in mind the fact that the most *recent* info
available to the public on the techniques used for decryption by the
government is from the *50s*. 

We have *partial* info on encryption techniques since then.

And with the principles from the late 40s/early 50s, it\'s possible to
write a program even on a *first* generation "personal computer" (the
author of the book I have used a Commodore Pet!) that can crack *any*
transposition or substitution cipher that doesn\'t have a keylength that
is the length of the message (ie anything but one-time pads). And even
message with *longer* key lengths can be cracked if the same key is
used more than once. 

And the worst part is that it takes longer to type in the cipher text
than for the computer to spit out the key length, and then for the next
program to spit out the clear text.

There\'s *no* info avialable (to my knowledge) about computer assisted
cracking of codes, or of modern bit-oriented ciphers.

Oh, things like energy flows fit to choke a wormhole...

Basicly, whenever they come up with a situation that includes the
*possibility* of global violations, closer analysis shows that
interactions "through" whatever sort of "gateway" you are using result
in energy flows or forces that either prevent the violation or prevent

You haven\'t given us the *good* stuff. Namely what the average daytime
and nighttime temps are. 

1464 hours is about 61 *days*. In 30 days, the temp can drop a *long*
ways. It can also *rise* a long ways. I figure the hottest part of the
day ought to be *well* above 100 C. Maybe even above 200. Which means th
given that average, nighttime temps would be as low as -134. 

given the 65.7 average, let\'s explore some differences:

diff	max	min
- ----	----	----
 25	 90.7	  40.7
 50	115.7	  15.7	water boils away before noon, rains like mad at
			night
 75	140.7	  -9.3	**snow**
100	165.7	 -34.3	
125	190.7	 -59.3	
150	215.7	 -84.3  CO2 snow
175	240.7	-109.3	Xenon rain
200	265.7	-134.3	Xenon snow
225	290.7	-159.3	Krypton rain, then snow
250	315.7	-184.3	*Oxygen* rain!
275	340.7	-209.3  Argon rain, then snow, nitrogen rain.
300	365.7	-234.3	Oxygen *snow*, nitrogen snow
325	390.7	-259.3	*Hydrogen* rain then snow...
350	415.7	   0K   it\'s *all* frozen, baby!

I don\'t have the melting or freezing points for methane and ammonia
handy. I only happened to remember the one for CO2. They aren\'t likely
to be present unless the atmosphere is "tainted". Ditto for a level of
xenon high enough for rain/snow.

The 150 degree swing isn\'t at all unlikely. First it rains like mad,
changing to snow as the temp drops. Then as the water runs out, the
temp drops *fast* (water is a greenhouse gas). And by condensing, it
releases heat. 

The skies will likely be clear by now.

Many hours later (at around -70 C?) CO2 will start to condense out as
fine crystals of dry ice, more like frost than snow, I would guess.
exhaled breath will *really* "steam" and fall as frost. And the temp
drop will accelerate again. 

This, in and of itself will be *very* bad for the characters. 

The argon, krypton, and xenon effects would require *much* higher than
normal levels of those gases. And high levels of xenon act like an
anaesthetic. So that\'s probably out. So is the hydrogen, but I put it
in as a reference.

The fun one is if you go for a 250 or more degree swing. Warnming the
players that *oxygen* condenses out of the atmosphere before dawn ought
to really thrill them no end. :-)

Vegetation will be *highly* flammable, as it\'ll have to be using mostly
weird alcohols and esters as sap to prevent freezing. Or else have
something in the sap that allow freezing without ice crystals forming
(so as to avoid damage). Animals will either have *deep* burrows, or
have really *weird* blood (again, so that they can freeze without
damage) 

Another thing to note is that the wider the temp swing, the farther
down you need to dig (or to go in a cave) to avoid it. Heck, in the
more extreme swing cases, there could be caves full of liquid gases
(much like ice caves here on earth). 

I wouldn\'t want to walk into a cave with a lake of LOX carrying any
kind of flame based light source! <eg>

And dayside will be no picnic either.

This depends on how you define "oppressive", and who is oppressed.

Golden Age Athens, for example, was great if you were a free Athenian
male, less so if you were anyone else - which means that less than 10% of
the population had anything close to the freedom we expect in Western
society today. Yet they managed a creative outpouring that we still admire.

The middle ages, contrary to popular beliefs, had a lot of technological
change and innovation. (Just read any of the farming manuals, for example,
or look at the development of power technology.)

On a fictional note, look at Stirling\'s Draka. Oppressive if you aren\'t a
Draka (and even if you are there are questions you don\'t ask), but as it\'s
the Draka doing the innovation...

Look at American (and Canada) during the 1950s. Freedom of association
curtailed, certain belief structures persecuted, limited rights for
minorities and females, yet a lot of technological innovation
none-the-less.  As long as you were a white male following the rules, you
didn\'t notice the restrictions very much.

I suspect that once you get a certain critical mass of innovators, you get
technological advancement. This can be a large propertion of a small
population, or a small proportion of a large population. Doesn\'t matter
which.

I read that article and thought about it finding a way around it. In my
campaign there IS a time machine, although still no one knows of it. (as
my pcs don\'t read this I can tell you). But there are some restrictions to
use it, as it is the type designed as a tipler-machine: 

1. You need a spaceship for time-crossing, as it is the size of a planet
so it cannot be moved by the players.

2. Travel is only possible within the time of the existence of the running
machine - as it had been built after the final war, there is no possibilty
for grandfather to return and redo his mistakes.

I liked the idea to get my players into the two alternate universes at one
and the same campaign, so I made this kind of an artifact. The original
idea came from Frank Tipler, after whom it is named. It\'s a giant cylinder
made of superdense material, rotating by half light velocity. This makes
an artificial black hole, time travel being done by crossing between the
event horizons either with or against the rotaion.

If this cylinder is stopped, there is no possibility to travel into the
past over this point in time.

Now consider a virus-infected ship or robot sent from the new era into the
time before the fifth frontier war to kill Norris, preventing him getting
Archduke and establishing the Regency - the last bastion against Virus and
also a puffer between virus space and the Zhodani Imperium ...

btw, has anybody heard something from the set of T3?

Also remember the \'Zhodani Map Box\', which also shows precognition talents
in very accurate manner. Also a hook for a time machine?

That\'s the most travellerish for me: Enigmas supporting new enigmas

The Megatraveller Journal #4 spends a lot on the K\'kree, so it is worth
being also an \'Alien\' book. I think it was first planned as own book
\'Lords of Thunder\', to be published by seeker, but then it had been made
the very last supplement put out by DGP. I still hate them for cancelling
the other Alien modules! But then I love them for publishing the first two

True, that is why I said \'fairly\'.  If it were 2.0 I\'d have said VERY light.

Had not though of that, but that is the patern so far.  What if there were
one that was an effective substitute for carbon/silicon in componds. IE 4
outer electrons with similar bonding habits?  Who can say what a new valence

I\'m not looking for any really wierd \'new\' properties just a bonding
charateristic similar to carbon and/or silicon.  What \'thoretical element\'
would most likely match carbon in it\'s chemical bonding habits? What would
it\'s \'theoretical\' half life be.  I was thinking \'for this adventure\' that
this new element would bond like carbon and/or silicon but the new compounds
would behave very diferent from either.  CO2 is a gas SiO2 is sand (I think
Si is silicon) but the new XO2 might be a liquid for example.  The \'new
carbon\' would be VERY good at replacing carbon and silicon perhaps
agressively so with potentially strange effects.  What would happen if the
silicon substrate in the party\'s computer were repalced with this new
element that just happen to be a conductive liquid in that compounding...HEE
HEE!  It would not take much of this to cause a lot of trouble.  What would
be some posible isotopes of this element x?  What would be their half lives
and radiographic properties?  HEE!  HEE!

Evil adventure ideas are brewing in my mind.

Is it posible for an isotope of an element to be more stable than is basic type?

Sure, a bollix effect, but then you are screaming in the EM spectrum and
begging for a flight of HARMs (Homing Anti Radiation Missle) with nuc. tips.
This also does nothing to stop Lidar and pasive optical tageting.  This
system also jams your own radar.  The bollix was the first \'radar jammer\'.
It worked the way a person screaming into a bull horn maked conversation

Nope, radar is a signal (ac) not a state (dc).  The oposite of a signal is
it\'s exact 180 degrees phase shifted self and that cancels it out.

This is posible with radar.  The reflected part of the radar signal is
canceled with an exact duplicate signal of opposing phase (called black
noise).  In space a no return is the expected responce to empty space but in
a more crowded area false signals would have to be sent to cover the \'dead
air\'.  The counters to this is \'frequency agile radar\' , a constantly and
randomly changing componet in the radar carrier, random pulsed radar, side
looking radar, sinthetic apature radar, and/or \'registation targets\' to test
for this type of ECM.  There is a constant battle between ECM and ECCM at
every stage of technical evolution.

 All this goes out the window with Lidar though.  Spoofing a properly
designed Lidar system sould be all but imposible (barring invisibility).
Your only real chance is to convince the operater that you are something
other than what you are and harmless or normal.  You would have to
physically change your ships outline if he had you in his threat library.
The ship hidden inside an asteroid trick could work for example.  Appearing
to be a different type of ship against a trained ELINT operater would be an
uncertain/imposible task with some serious extra negative modifiers for
someone with no ELINT training.  Though it should be only
uncertain/formiable to appear to be a deferent but not specific ship of the
same type IF the person doing the disguise was a trained ELINT operater.

"Heh Joe, the March Harrier is back 3 weeks early"

"How do know it\'s the Harrier, Fred?"

"That same leeky left ventral thruster baffle, Joe"

"Maybe, but when did the Harrier start debarking Zoodoni assualt warbots in
mass!!!"

The above senereo would take an uncurtain/imposible task role of an ELINT
operater/engineer or a uncurtain/difficult task for a military ELINT team.

That is the concept behind ELINT and SigINT systems but what you are talking
about is a complex and exacting science.  Not something that your average
jack leg could do with standard equipment.  The tricks you purpose are in
the realm of spy ships and stealth systems of military quality.

Dunno bout that.  Thing is, I\'ve had my Zippo for a couple years now.  I

Um...it\'s 10 atmospheres.  It doesn\'t really matter all that much, people are
going to be wearing fully contained suits anyway, and the atmosphere is
probably reasonably toxic all the time.

Personally, I\'d go with a nice simple one.  Water.  Given the _amount_ of
liquid the planet has (30%) and the temperature range, having 50-meter acid
snowdrifts form at night and then all melt and run into the lowlands during the
day would be plenty terrifying (and plenty lethal).

Not really - the most stable tends to be the basic state, since after any
long period
of time it is all you have left.

If the half life is in the 100 million years+ category, then you might
worry about
how much of each are created but I don\'t think that applies to elements
beyond 100.

It might be possible to a have a stable element but no way to make it because
all the nearby elements decay too rapidly.

The last time this came up (about IR masking) I thought the agreement
was that anti-noise only works for sound.

The problem is that you can\'t just broadcast an anti-signal, the signal
has to be exactly out of phase or you can measure the difference.
With sound you can use the fact that by the time your electronics
have worked out the correct anti signal, it has only moved a few cm,
so there is plenty of time to get your signal to the loudspeaker.

With any EMR (radio, light, etc) the signal is travelling at the speed of
light, so even if you can calculate the anti-signal in zero time, it
will still have gone before your emitter can emit it.

As if this wasn\'t bad enough, you have to create the anti-signal photon
by photon and according to a certain famous principle, its not just
that you can\'t measure the values accurately enough without changing
them, its that the values aren\'t actually defined until you do
measure them, at which point you know the old values and the changed
values are again uncertain !

Resolution is limited by the size of the satellite; 200-km orbit 5-micron
thermal IR the resolution in meters is about (1 meter)/(satellite mirror
diameter in meters). 

(For sensors from FFS2, you can take the resultions given there and divide
by about a hundred for LEO/thermal IR.)

>What about over-sampling, or increasing resolution by taking multiple

The multiple-picture trick helps if your pixels are too big, but doesn\'t
overcome the fundamental resolution limit given above. Oversampling
and image processing similarly doesn\'t help you much unless you have
priori knowledge of what the object you\'re looking at is (ie one could tell
where a lightbulb is to much better than the 1m given above, but couldn\'t
tell a 5-cm round lightbulb from a 20-cm square one.)

Hey, If I close the Combat Support element I can kill them while opening
with the enemy battleline. Divide and conquer.

Anyway, the enemy battleline can\'t take whatever I\'m defending away from
me. The troopships can.

They all have sufficient fuel for two successive jumps? If so, they are
giving a lot of tonnage away to fuel that they could otherwise be using
for their real jobs.

But while you\'re whacking out easy soft targets, the Intruder\'s main battle 
line can be softening up your orbital defenses and coming up your kilt.  He 
may not be able to land and hold more than a small island for a beachhead, but 
he\'ll be able to keep *YOU* away from home pretty easily.  And if he does some 
creative resupplying, he can always fuel up a courier ship and go bring in 
reinforcements.  You, on the other tentacle, having no jump-capable ships, are 
*stuck*.  How long can you breathe vacuum?

Bridges were being built throughout human history. A bridge enginneer
today has a large body of knowledge, rules, and parts he can draw apon to
design the bridge he needs. A bridge of 1000BC was much more of an art to
construct.

The same with software enginneering. With the 3000+ years of history
between us and them the art of software enginneering would have become
much more of a science. You will still need a software enginneer like you
need a bridge enginneer. The tools that the Imperial Software enginneer
has will be several order of magnitude better than what we have now. They
will have at the least proven software components with known reliable
means of connecting them together. 

A software enginneer is needed for his knowledge of taking the Imperial
catalog of software and component and putting them together to solve the
customer\'s problem.

In addition the problems themselves will be much better understood. Issues
of data retrieval, accounting, word processsing, nagivation, piloting will
have a variety of best of breed solutions implemented.

Well, you can\'t ever get away from programming computers, on some
level...no matter what the TL. Of course programming methods and systems
will become far more advanced; to what point, I don\'t know.

But I suspect:

Serious OO throughout the systems...You want your High Zhodani Spell
checker to worknwith your system, buy one. Plug it in, and everything
that deals with spelling will use it.

You want to program? Buy a programming kit. It would probably be a
collection of modules you plug together in one fashion or another.
Notice, I\'m talking in virtual terms, not physical, here.

Specialized programming, for use with, for instance, the \'programming\'
skills, would involve module building modules, at an increasingly lower
level as the programmers skill goes up.

Humans have been visually oriented critters since long before we left
the trees; I suspect that programming will involve putting things
together like a jigsaw puzzle rather than writing code. This is an old
concept even now: the first relational database for the Mac, Helix, did
this in something like 1985 or 86; there\'s Hypercard, of course, though
that still requires pounding out code by hand; and sophisticated stuff
like National Lab\'s LabView,a serious lab and instrumentation control
and analysis package, which, like Helix is \'programmed\' by sticking
things together like legos, on screen.

Real, low-level stuff, actually twiddling the bits, would have been
taken over by optimizing compilers long, long ago. Programming in
\'languages\' would be viewed as beyond quaint; as if someone came up to
me today and announced that he\'d gotten his Jaquard loom to calculate
logarithms...or that he\'d keyed in a program flipping switches on the
face of his Altair.

The idea of a partially-charged lanthanum grid acting as a poor man\'s

Let\'s see now...Combat Support will consist of transports, munitions
ships, TANKERS....

If the tankers brought enough fuel for the battlewagons, topping off the
tanks of the CSE will be no problem - and will take trivial amounts of
time compared to interception times.

This has been said so many times in this thread already - space is big.
The defender can either mass his forces to protect what he wants to
keep, or he can spread his forces to the point of literal uselessness in
an attempt to intercept you where he wants to, instead of where you want
him to. 

Space combat in Traveller, with few exceptions(1), is by mutual consent. 
There are too many things either side can do to avoid combat to make it
otherwise.

Walt Smith

(1): The exceptions involve fixed positions like planets - you know he has
to defend it, he knows you\'ll have to come and get it. Another exception
would involve deception, difficult to do when both sides are already
suspicious.

An extra 10% of hull dedicated to an emergency Jump 1 is worth it to me...
Besides; Imperial standards seem set on J4 as a fleet standard (and even J5
for auxilleries was mentioned somewhere...). I don\'t think it would be too
much of a hardship to plan an atack from J3, with a J1 rally point. If this
can\'t be done; the supports can do an insystem micro jump. I would leave
maximum jumps insystem for extraordinary circumstances as I wouldn\'t want to
EVER get caught with empty tanks or in the middle of refueling, no matter how
unlikely that would be...

There will be problems that optimized compilers can\'t fix, and solutions
that the standard modules won\'t be quite right for. While situations where
the programmer has to hack right down to the machine\'s own level will
become steadily rarer, these situations will exist - and the dying breed
of techs who can do this kind of work will command steadily higher
prices.

say about the SOA computer technology when people see no reason
to specialize software skills over hardware skills?

    'body' => 'Hello again,

Sorry to take so long to get back on this, real life intervened.  I hate it
when that happens.

Rather than try to reply to each of the many points made in sequence I will
try to illustrate my views of the general concepts raised.

I concede that there are convincing arguments for quite dramatic tech lags
and in the backwoods of many worlds I think that very primitive societies
may remain. However I still maintain that there is too great a diversity
within the more mature interstellar communities for these arguments alone to
make it credible, without considerable suspension of disbelief.  Not that I
necessarily feel that Well I like it isnt a good enough reason for the
variation to remain.  More on this another day.

Communication, Isolation, The Long Night and Sustainable tech.
I think that for the post long night, M0 campaign and the post viral shut
down, TNE the diverse TLs are fine.  The worlds have been left to their own
devices for long periods of time and would have been forced to turn inwards.
But I think in the very extent of the technological collapse during the long
night we have evidence of the pervasiveness of exterior influences.  Ask
yourselves just how sustainable is any nations technology in isolation.
The UK for example, my home, would be really stuffed if suddenly isolated
from world trade, yet it is one of the most advanced nations on the planet.
Also I dont imagine that the Technology is developed independently on
multiple worlds, obviously some duplication of effort will occur as does
today, but I believe that the 3I scientific communities will be as keen to
publish their findings as our modern ones.  I also imagine therefore that
the Imperiums technology is a collective thing with the richest and most
culturally important regions benefiting first.

Economics & Imports
If transportation costs are the main factor limiting imports why not build
factories on the world.  Ford an American car company has factories in the
UK, Portugal, Poland etc.   I think also resources are a main determining
factor in planetary wealth not just tech.  Look at Alaska or most of Canada,
100 years ago wildernesses, now with first world cities, outside investment
has built these not the native tribes.

This leads me to an aside.  Surely many systems would have to import raw
materials.  Vland for example, after 10,000 years of interstellar society
there cant be many minerals left in the system.  Also Terra with hardly any
colonies must have born the brunt of the Interstellar wars logistics, and
the Earth is running low on many materials now.  Also I imagine many A
population worlds would have a hard time feeding themselves, although high
tech farming is perhaps a more obvious solution.  Continuing this train of
thought, I ask is bulk shipping of manufactured goods to a system with
insufficient manufacturing capability really not economically viable if that
world has the capital to pay for them?.  Again the UK is a good example,
with little indigenous manufacturing capability the UKs wealth is largely
derived from trade and financial sources.

Time
IM(and others)O the Imperium is _very_ stable government with less than 20
major wars in over 1000 years its also _very_  peaceful.  This is a good
reason for the slow rate of technological advancement but not a good reason
for the diversity.  With such an untaxed society plenty of resources would
be available for other less urgent projects.  I just cant believe that
planets in the main cultural regions of the Imperium, on the main
communication routes and exposed to free trade and more importantly
advertising, from exterior influences for over a thousand years of relative
peace, would fail to be within a few TLs of their neighbours.  The major
urban areas which is after all what the TL applies to* - of Africa and
Asia, many of which have only been opened to regular contact with western
technology for relatively short periods of time are not really that far
behind, 3TLs at the most.

* TNE rules say:
The Tech Level of a world determines the type, quality, and sophistication
of the products commonly available on a world in _urban areas or near the
starport_.  Large areas of the world away from the starport or away from
large population centres may be one or even two Tech Levels lower.

Culture & Xenophobia
This IMHO is arguably the most persuasive case for the diversity found.
Vilani culture was obviously very widespread pre ROM, however many of its
vital corner stones were suppressed by the Solomani, the caste system for
example. While I think that this could have been overturned on many worlds
during the long night I dont think that this reverse would have been
universal.  Also the 3I culture would seem to be at least Solomani
based aristocracy, measurements, language etc- albeit with heavy Vilani
influences.  However the myriad of different governments within the Imperium
would have widely different views on the subject and I am utterly
comfortable with the idea that some of them wish their world to be backward.
At least everyone except the leadership itself anyway ?, in a similar style
to the TEDs in the new era or some African dictatorships today.  However
would the 3I permit such governments to exist? Realistically quite probably
as long as they didnt cause too much trouble. This raises a new question
just how interfering are the 3I authorities.

Government aid.
I think the mere presence of 3I installations would have a dramatic effect
of the world.  Hong Kong is a good comparable RW example.  Also does the 3I
not have aid programs or any economic aid packages comparable to EU funding
for the less developed member states?  I think they would.

Finally, re the input from people responding to my question of what a TTL 8
world could contribute to a TTL 15 war effort.  I did say That could not be
produced cheaper or better elsewhere, terrible English I know but it was
the crux of my point.  Incidentally I like the idea of taking low tech
people for the armed forces.  I can see this could be a problem for the more
technical posts but for the grunts sounds feasible enough.  Also this could
lead to some very interesting regimental traditions.

Nah, you need hydrogen to achieve jump. Substitute hydrogen for lighter fuel.

Now there is an idea.  An element that can\'t be made except by some
rediculously rare natural process like in the heart of a neutron star
because all those above it normally decay not into it but other lower
elements and those below it have such short have lives that making it by
building it up from lower elements is impractical.  If it had some very
useful property that made it valuable then it would make a near perfect
adventure maguffin.  Even a tiny amount would be worth a fortune.

A great reason for thugs to be after an adventure group.  The thugs \'know\'
that they have something very valuable but it is small and hidden in
something easily overlooked.

Very true for light.  I said in my post that Lidar was all but unbeatable if
properly designed.  Radar on the other hand is a lot easier of fool.

There are analog methods of producing the canceling signal without any
appreaciable lag time (the lag time is figured into the needed amount of
phaze shift based on band width).  The canceling signal is produced from the
main signal by propagation delay phaze shifting it .5 wave lenghts.  It is
also composed of electron/hole pairs not photons.

Disclaimer:  I do not nor have I ever worked with ECM systems but I have
designed or helped design various specialty filters over the years that
acomplish this.

There are also physical shapes that reflect RF signals away from their point
of origin.  There are also Radar Absorbant Materials including paint.  There
are also materials that are invisable to radar.

RF is very different in practice from light.  For example copper conducts RF
but not light.  A sheet of bright orange plastic is very visable opticly but
invisable to radar.   What looks very big and solid to the eye can look tiny
or perfectly clear to radar.

Not necessarily.  If they are J-3 capable and arrive by a 1 hex jump with
full tanks they could in theory jump 2 more times without refueling.  Many
of the combat ships of the Empirium are jump 3 capable without drop tanks
and with them they could jump 3 in and have 3 hexes of jump to use if needed.

Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.  I think LHyd would make my lighter too cold to handle.  
Can\'t we just call the regular lighter fluid \'unrefined fuel\' and let it go at 
that??

Simple.  I pop it outta the case, turn it upside down, and squeeze the can the 
fuel is in.  Wala.  Skimmed.

rewarded for their efforts by the ruling elite, thus the high tech level,
philosophers on the other hand are re-educated, thus the oppresive system.

Actually, it seems to me that the police are part of federal service, not
civillian jobs. I could be wrong as I\'m reading this for the first time,
however I did just read two parts that seemed to back this. First off,
reference is made that a lot of M.I. leave service for Police jobs. Another
point, there is a fight where an officer shows up at the end of it. He lets
them walk because they\'re M.I.

Later.

I"ve re-read the part your mentioning and the is no reference to the police
being federal service.  The fight in question was not instigated by the
M.I. troopers and the officer knows it.  He asks the M.I. if they want to
press charges, they don\'t (they won) and then they leave, note that this
leaving is not the same as the office letting then off BECAUSE they are
M.I.  My point is still valid, only former military personnel have the
right to vote. No its not a society that could exist today but that the
beauty of book, you can make up any society you want.

Zhodani found a small device which could project a 3D starmap which
covered a corridor 8.000 parsecs long and 30 parsecs wide aimed coreward.
The artifact also proved to be a strong psionic focus for only the most
talented psions (less than 1/10.000) managed to have it reveal more
accurate data, such as clearer visions of ships and star constellations
somewhere the mapped route. When these visions proved to be true
reflections of reality, the device was made a state-secret overnight, to
be used only under very strictly controlled circumstances. This device
has been one of the main reasons for the Zhodani to launch their Core
Expeditions.

Sigh. Mostly because the standard world generation system have zero
correlation between habitability and population. One of its few flaws,
but it\'s a doozy!



So, do I alter the population and tech level rules in First In, or
     do we accept the fact that the Spinward Marches were designed using
     less realistic rules?  (This isn\'t the only case in which First In
     will give you noticeably different results from the Classic Traveller
     system, either.)
Jon Zeigler


There is currently a debate on the playtest of First In.  Using a more
realist set of world/system generating, you get worlds that dont\' match
Traveller canon.  Supposedly there are 125 systems in the Spinward Marches
alone that violate the proposed generation system.  While some can be
explained away, many more cannot.  And this is only for one sector, how many
more star system are like this across the canon sectors created by CT rules?

I for one would like to see a more realistic rules set for system
generation.  I say alter the canon sectors by the minimum necessary to get
them into compliance, but alter them.  Down TL 2 barbarians living in exotic
atmospheres!

What does anyone else think?  More realistic or stick with canon or
something in between?

The problem is that you can\'t just broadcast an anti-signal...

If there is no physical way to \'cloak\' a ship, is there a software, v-chip,
way to do it?

I\'ve been playing with the idea of \'hardened\' installations and or ships
being invisible to sensors, not because of some type of cloaking device
(which seems impossible) but because the sensors are built not to recognize
certain things.  This was from some story that the civilzation didn\'t trust
artificial intelligences and kept them spoofed with things like this.

If the Imperial government controls \'the space between the stars\' and all
the starports, doesn\'t that mean they control all starship construction?  Or
at least the technical specs for starships?  Certain installations and ships
could be built that activate this vchip, spoofing the sensors.  The
installation itself could be pouring out a broad range of EM, but if the
computers that operate your sensors have the vchip, you don\'t see anything
on your screens.

This won\'t work against non Imperial ships, of course, so it would\'nt help
against a Zhodani attack fleet, or probably even a vargr corsair (unless it
was built with Imperial sensors), so such things would have limited military
use.  But would there be enough need by the government to keep Eneri the
merchant capitan from \'seeing\' a top secret research station in an outter
system?

Would the trouble of maintaining tech standards across the Imperium match the
possible gains?

TL2 barbarians living in an exotic atmosphere are most likely a native minor 
race, 99% likely to be *nonhuman*.  A classic example from sci fi:  The 
Ullers, from H. Beam Piper\'s \'Uller Uprising\', were recruited to work on a 
planet with a heavy florine taint because they could handle it better than 
humans could, being a silicon-based life form.

You can *always* come up with a reason for things being the way they are if 
you look hard enough.  You just gotta let go of your humanocentricism and let 
your imagination *fly*.  Remember, we\'re talking alien planets here, *not* 
your won back yard...

I remember a short story by Jerry Pournelle set in his Falkenberg

The *Imperium* isn\'t particularly ideological, but some of its
member worlds quite probably are.  Frankly, I suspect we humans will
always have our conflicts between utopians who dream of the ideal
social order, pragmatists who dream only of order, and those dream
of personal wealth and power.  While we do, conditions will arise
from time to time where past events play out all over again.  

Now *if* you have such a world in a strategic position surrounded by
competing powers you could see a reply of the Spanish Civil War. I
can easily see "volunteer brigades" and "space pirates" being
unofficially sponsored by the competing powers.  Adventure parties
could be hired as mercenaries, crew ships "running guns" and
supplies to one side or the other, or just get caught up
accidentally in the madness.

manufacture anything more advanced than a gas cylinder?  That\'s just
one quick off-the-cuff, knowing very little about the planet, but you
get my drift.  Most worlds are exploited to support the Rich, Ind and

hellholes with a very narrow use.  The changes you are proposing sound
as though they would preclude the occurance of virgin worlds. 
Homogenization is good for milk, but for Traveller?

Am I misremembering, or doesn\'t lanthanum have a strong affinity for
hydrogen?  I seem to recall it being suggested as a way of holding a
large quantity of hydrogen in a safe manner.

ObTrav...that\'s why I thought lanthanum was picked for the grid,
it\'s ability to absorb and then slowly release large quantities of
hydrogen.

Even \'garden worlds\' can be traps.  They might have all the necessary things 
on them for human life, but still be inhospitable for some reason or another, 
like, the primary is a flare star, or a deadly disease lives there, or it 
could just be set aside for future Imperial expansion when the time is right.

Absolutely.  IMNSFBHO, every world should have its *own* feel.  But then,

Hmm.  Some possible worlds in the Spinward Marches:

Porozlo - balkanised along ideological lines:  Free Commerce vs Private
Ownership.  Add extreme versions of each faction, the Ine Givar, and some
Vargr.

Aramanx - general battleground/powderkeg.  Ideological differences are
unclear.  Vargr are involved.

Garda-Vilis/Tanoose - Separatists vs pro-Vilisans vs whatever.  Sword
Worlders & Ine Givar & probably Arden Federation types all meddling.

Vilis - Could easily have a "mishap" in the aftermath of Garda-Vilis
trouble.  "Franco" could be commander of Vilisan colonial forces on
Garda-Vilis.

Any world in the Sword Worlds/Border Worlds.

Also, any world in the Islands Cluster.

Not at all, the information on modern decryption techniques is
available on the net. In fact, the net is the location of the most
modern crypto techniques, including the one that
broke 128-bit RSA encryption recently

>We have *partial* info on encryption techniques since then.

Actually we have _complete_ information on modern crypto techniques.

The concept of the enemy not knowing your encryption technique is not
currently considered a serious way of protecting your information.

A modern cryptogrphic method _must_ be able to stand up well to an
enemy that has
both  the algorithm and the ability to have any text they like
encrypted by you.

This happens to be simple, knowing the algorithm doesn\'t really help
you crack 2048-bit RSA encryption.

There\'s tons actually. Try the crypto newsgroup faqs, and the many
excellent mathematics texts on the subjects (I\'d give a reference, but
I don\'t currently have access to my library)

In general though, while a few techniques can be used to narrow the
search space, the only realistic methods of cracking are brute force,
the arguments are merely over which brute force search pattern is
likley to be optimal, a simple example would be: "is sequentially
trying each possible key better than randomly trying each possible key

You dont need to suspend disbelief. Just adopt Marxist/Post-Marxist
development theory for the purposes of Traveller. Just tell the players
that a capitalist system tends towards a perpetual crisis of
underdevelopment in it\'s neocolonial economies.

Those of you who believe in neoclassical economics can regard it as an
econobabble handwave :)

The UK did pretty well between 1939 and 1943, when it\'s trade fell to less
than a third of it\'s pre-War level.

Alaska and Canada are part of States that pump a lot of money into their
\'neo-colonial peripheries\'. In the case of Alaska, a lot of the
infrastructure is a result of the military installations (the Alaska-Canada
Highway was built in WW2) and the fact the state has 2 Senators.

The Imperium doesnt do this. I imagine that individual nobles might, but
more commonly you would bribe the local headman, bring in a company of
hi-tech mercenaries to protect your facility, and shoot any locals who
disagree. Oh yeah, and billet your mercenaries at the starport - first
locals who have a go at them there trigger Imperial intervention.

Simple. If they cant afford it, they dont buy from you. And if this means
they cant buy capital goods, then they stay underdeveloped.

Sort of. You can run a line from the mercers and suttlers who equipped to
the Elizabethan privateers, to the merchant houses that backed the British
East India Company asset-stripping India, to the banks that put up the
money for the Cotton, Canal and Railways Booms, to the investors who funded
the Industrial Revolution.

And Britain was a manufacturing power, until bankrolling both world wars
exhausted it, and left it with an industrial infrastructure they could not
afford to update.

Thats TNE, where interstellar trade isnt anywhere near as pervasive as in
the Imperial Golden Age. For the Golden Age, TL should just apply to local
manufacturing capability, with the rest depending on how well the local can
afford the import price and imported spares.

They arent. At least not officially. It\'s your planet, run it how you want,

Nope. This would be a gross intervention of the basic Imperial philiospohy
of ruling the space between the worlds, not the worlds themselves.

Note that Dulinor was almost certainly in favour of this, and the idea that
the Imperium should do this was a reason behind his revolt.

Yeah. Note that if you have wages and pensions paid in hard Imperial

lot more eager to join the Imperial Services than residents of the Core

  IIRC, the Ullerans were well-suited to the extremes of their own world

damage from working on Niflheim. OTOH, they work real cheap and two pairs

Alas, the designs *should* take mass into account as well. Any *real*
ship can *either* bulk out before it grosses out (ie it ran out of
space well before hitting the mass limit) *or* gross out before it
bulks out (ie it hit the maximum mass it can lift before it ran out of
space in the hold).

One of the odder factors in Traveller ship design is the fact that fuel
is one of the *least* dense materials known. This screws up lots of
things. Including leading game designers to make the mistake of
assuming that cargos have similar densities.

when we started getting O2 in the atmosphere. 

But what got me was the next item. 1.2 billion years ago. That\'s when
Earth finally had a *year round* oxygen atmosphere (and soon after a
permanent ozone layer). Until then we only had an oxygen atmosphere in
the summer, and not much of one at that.

I\'d never encountered that "detail" before. And it got me thinking.
That\'s an *awfully* long time in the history of the planet. I wonder
how many "tainted", "tainted thin", "thin", etc atmospheres are simply
due to the planet being young? It gives us another possible explanation
for some of the weird atmospheres.

Quantum physics. It has been proven that chemical propeties can be

that it\'s not *practical* to generate the predictions for anything
beyond hydrogen.

None. Check things out and note the progression in that part of the
chart. Carbon, silicon, germanium, tin, bismuth, ???. The progression
of preties is steadily more metallic, even as the melting points go
down.

Ain\'t gonna happen. The increased atomic weight is going to take care
of *that*. With the exception of "Noble gases" (period VIIIA), it\'s
virtually *certain* that all non-carbon-based compounds that are
gaseous or liquid at normal temps are already known. Again, it\'s a
matter of the way the increase in atomic weight affects the properties
of elenments.

Sorry, but that ain\'t gonna happen. because of the way they form
covalent rather than ionic bonds carbon and silicon are the *hardest*
to "displace" in a compound. It\'s the metals and non-metals that pull
that sort of trick, not the "semi-metals".

Alas, you\'ll have to come up with ones that don\'t involve *highly*
improbable properties. Any "interesting" properties of new elements are
going to be "subtle", such as the wide variety of properties the
lathanides have. Their properties on the "gross" scale are *very*
similar. But when you get down to more subtle effects you get weird
things like the solid electrolyte oxygen fuel batteries.

The most stable *is* the "basic type".

Could you please use a fixed pitch font when writing messages? Or at

Also, your software is using non-ASCII characters for apostrophe, and

Because labor is cheap there or because there was *already* a market.

We live in an unusual period. Recycling will be far more prevelant in
the future (as it was in the past). Either items will be designed to be
more repairable, or there will be "incentives" to recycle broken items.

Believe me, it\'s cheaper to recycle than to mine new raw materials. You
both conserve materials *and* avoid the problem of "where do we dump
things *now*?"

Modern dumps are going to be *mined* in less than 100 years.

First of all, there\'s not much point in advertising to poor, low TL
neigbors. They can neither afford nor use most of your products. 

And just *maybe* the Imperium has learned from the history of Earth and
other worlds. Development driven by *outside* interests is uniformly
*bad* for natives. Developement driven by *local* interests can take
longer, but tends to be more stable and not screw things up as much.
And by doing it themselves they just might come up with something new. 

So while the Imperium wouldn\'t actively discourage companies from
developing low TL world, it may not give them any encouragement either.
And the companies may know better too.

After all, by your own arguments, the Imperium is going to be taking
the *long* view on things. They\'ll actually consider things like "what
happens when the deposit is worked out?" They\'ll plan in *centuries*.
That\'ll make them rather different than the folks who did most of the
mineral and industrial development on earth.

I suggest digging up some of Norton\'s old SF. In many of the books she
has the port having the damnedest mixes of high and low tech. Of course
she *does* have an authority that frowns on screwing up native
cultures. But that generally amounts to "no selling the natives
advanced weapons so that they can conquer their neighbors".

You aren\'t looking at it properly. Nobody wishes to be "backward". They
wish to maintain their "sacred traditions". Especially if said
traditions have them running things, and changes might upset the status
quo.

I don\'t expect to see a "prime directive". But given the range of
government and law levels allowed, I\'d bet that there *are* rules to
prevent "cultural imperialism". No fair trying to impose your
"superior" culture unless you\'ve actually *conquered* the place.

As per my arguments above, I suspect that aid would be *very* limited.
This prevent the "African Dictator" types from ruining the place while
wasting the aid. 

I expect that aid is more likely to be in the form of scholarships for
those who wish to study off-world (and even more likely *loans* rather
than scholarships). 

"Economic development loans" probably exist, but they\'ll be judged more
objectively than we tend to. And they *will* be loans. So they\'ll be
given for things where venture is likely to actually *work*, so that
the loan can be paid back. 

In case you are wondering, I feel this way because *far* too much "aid"
has *worsened* the situation it seeks to correct. Famine relief, for
example. What *should* be done is buy food *locally* so as to encourage
more *local* production. Instead, we dump surplus food and the result
is to *decrease* local food production.

Or consider the Aswan High Dam in Egypt. By stopping the annual floods,
it required the farmers to use fertilizer (before the dam, the floods
deposited a new layer of rich soil every year). And it takes the full
output of the dam to produce the fertilizer. Of course, now it\'s almost
silted up, and the power generation is dropping off, and it\'s likely to
fail. But they got their status symbol project!

As I commented last year (from a rather different background),
something I was reading had a unit commander being asked if one of the
companies could build a sweat lodge onto their winter barracks, since
there wouldn\'t be much to do (the company in question had a shamanistic
type religion). He agreed and noted as long as they were cooped up in
the barracks there was no reason they shouldn\'t take their spirits for
a walk now and then. Just be sure to put in for leave time if they were
planning any extended spirit quests.

I can easily see that sort of question (and response) in an *Imperial*
unit with troops from the right sort of planet (and not necessarily a
low tech one). 

And I suspect that a situation much like Norton\'s "Star Guard" exists.
There may be some limits on how much tech level difference is allowed
between a merc unit and their employers. Or even if there isn\'t, it may
be a *lot* cheaper for the local "Roman Empire" equivalent to hire
several thousand cavalry a TL or so above their level than to hire TL8
tank squad!

Now *there* is an interesting setup for adventures. The players
organize a low tech merc unit and undercut the high tech boys for
business on the low tech planets. Transport is a bit trickier, but it
should still be doable. Especially given that the low tech troops will
be happy with quarters a lot more cramped than high tech troops will. :-)

The problem is that only Imperial merchants cannot see these ships
and installations.

So if a pirate gets hold of a supply then it is going to have
a significant advantage - especially if it uses non-Imperial sensors.

Also anyone can spot the IN easily because of this recognisable
feature in their sensors - which they have to be permanently transmitting
in order to disable sensors at a decent distance.
So the new way to spy: Equip an Imperial merchant with a cheap Zhodani
radio receiver. Jump in system. Detect the disabling transmission.
Log the presence of a top secret research station of hidden fleet.
Pretend not to have seen it and do your bit of trading.
Jump to the next world and the beauty is that the Imperials don\'t
even suspect that you know where they are.

If your top secret research station does not reduce emissions to avoid a
merchant, then any non-Imperial spy ship can see it. If it can hide
from a non-Imperial spy ship, it doesn\'t need the vchip.

I think that you\'ll find that radar acts a lot more like infra-red than
an RF signal down a copper cable.

For a start it has nothing to do with electron/hole pairs. (Well
generating and receiving the signal might, but its propagation does not).

You could probably devise an apparatus using an optical fibre loop to
give a half wavelength shift in a laser beam which would result in a
cancelling signal. The same technology would not help you be invisible to
my torch. Your anti signal has to cope with radar photon that can bounce
off any point on your ship in any direction at any phase.

either.

All are true for light and every frequency in the EM spectrum.
The problems of hiding in Traveller are that:

   a	The active sensors are either very powerful, or wideband or both.
	It is difficult to be invisible at all frequencies.
   b	The target emits vast quantities of IR.

Copper conducts RF, but I think you\'ll find that it *reflects* radar.

Would that mean that the northern parts of the planet having oxygenated
atmos while the southern would not as summer winter occur at opposite parts
of the year. Does really the atmosphere mix so slow as to not thouroughly
mix in say quarter of a year? Amazing if true, it could mean travelling
civs who follow the breathable atmosphere patch circling the planet every
year (Wheelworld by Harry Harrison anyone?)

Once you get into space, there are all those asteroids to mine, plus the other
planets. A high tewch system can probably generate more raw materials than a
low tech one.

Also, improved efficiency and recycling might means that the material impact
on their system isn\'t so very great. It takes a lot of starships to shift one
medium sized asteroid.

The real limiter now is energy. A TL F world does not have that problem.

A few Million ton hydroponics satellites in orbit should help, even if the

The cost is 1kCr/dt.

The "delivery charge" on my car (from a factory <200 miles away) was about
1kCr.
and you should be able to get several per dt, so even low value items
should be
able to shift a few jumps at a profit.

The question is "Is it worth building a factory on this world to produce 1,000
widgets per year when three jumps away our megawidget factory could produce
that many in a tea break for only marginal cost?"

Think again. At the key point in the growth of the British Empire, ie
1750-1850
the approximation World Manufacture = UK manufacture held for most "high
tech" goods

Europe and America only caught up towards the end of the last century.

The Garden class satellites have been designed to allow the population of almost
any system with at low cost (as low as 7,377Cr per person per year)
Able to produce food irrespective of the local ecology and with sufficient manoeuvre
to be able to exist even in asteroid fields, the Garden class only needs enough
local shipping to be able to take the food where it is needed.

To this end it can dock up to three 1kdt transports simultaneously.

All of the airlocks have advanced decontamination facilities to reduce
to spread of any unwanted organisims, either on board or off.

The thiry five trained mission specialists are backed up by an impressive suite
of laboratories and computer facilities - sufficient to overcome almost any
agricultural disaster that you might be facing.

Garden class satellites are available in 4 designs according to need:

Why is that?  The math to complicated?  If a pc found say element 274, what
would he have to do to calculate what it could be used for?  What would the
computing requirements be for this type of calculation?

Would this apply even with very heavy elements?  If you go far enough could
you end up with a \'new\' carbon?  Maby element 4017?  Sorry my chemistry did

OK, what about crystals then.  Could this ultra heavy element have a

Good point.  That I should have remembered.  What if a new element had a new
valence level with say 8, 16, 32, or 64 electrons that tended to form
covelent bonds with large numbers of carbon atoms to form a \'supper
crystal\'.  Kind of like a bucky ball diamond.  If the compound were a
simiconductor as well it would be of great value in the electronic industry
or if it were an insolater like silicon it could be used as a very durable
substrate.  

Or perhaps if this super bucky ball crystal could like bucky balls capture
atoms or molecules inside it\'s own structure it could have some interesting
functions.  
Say if this super crystal could while \'holding\' tridium be made to cold fuse
with the side effect that the output energy was released as clean electrical
charge with He and low heat as byproducts.

Or if the \'captured atoms\' were plutonium they could be made to fission.
Stable non californiaum pocket nucs.

Sorry fishing for a good Mcguffin for a game I\'m planing.  An atomic bomb
\'diamond\' pendant would be great especially if only a few people (not the
player to start with) knew what it could do.

Thanks for your insight.  Would it be posible that the \'special property\' of
one of these new elements could be such that it either greatly increases
Jump performance or that it greatly improved jump fuel efficency?  Or
perhaps one of it\'s isotopes.  Say for example that a jump drive modified
with this new catalist Jumpium 137 could make a jump with half the H2
normally required.

What if it took Jumpium 139 instead and the characters had only found
Jumpium 137?  What would be necessary to turn it into it isotopic form?  And
where would the PC be able to do this?  Great McGuffin.  You can half your
fuel use (or double your jump distance) if you can break into this secret
imperial base to use the super colider to convert that ore sample into
useable Jumpium.

No it does not.  Radar IS RF.  Lidar is IR or some other form of light.
Radar is electronic in nature not photonic.  It is a radio signal.  Check
the frequencys of naval radar units.  They are in the MHZ to GHZ range.  Low
frequencey band (LF), high band (HF), very high band (VHF), ultra high band
(UHF), and for close range and targeting radar the milimeter range
(microwave).  I worked on and designed radar and lidar systems.  Radar uses
coax and wave guides.  Photonic systems use fibre optic cable.  They are not
interchangable.  Neather signal passes well (if at all) through the others
conducter.

Radar is not photonic.  Light as far as I know can not be canceled with
phaze shift because all it\'s partical have the same charge (0).  Electronic
signals have charge that can be canceled with their oposite.  The \'oposite\'
of an electron is a \'hole\' which in effect is the lack of an electron rather
that a partical in its\' own right.

Note also that the speed of light varries with what it is passing through.

Not at all important.  Power output has no effect on the \'radar image\' of
the target.  Only the range of the radar unit.  Also target size that can be
detected is limited to wave lenght.  If the target is less than on wave
length in all dementions facing the radar unit it is invisible.  Note the
the size is effective size.  Not physical size.  An F-111 stealth fighter
looks smaller than a beer can from the front to radar.

Wide banding radar on planetary distances has some ugly drawback and limitions.

>	It is difficult to be invisible at all frequencies.

        invisiblelity is relative.  If your radar image is the size of a
mouse you are not going to be detected except at close range by millimeter
radar.

        True invisiblity is imposible (as far as we know for light).

>   b	The target emits vast quantities of IR.

        Assuming you are running your power plant, and assuming that the
power plant is as heat wastefull as we think it is.  We can\'t build
Traveller power plants so we have to guess at what they can and can not do.
Also with a black globe you do not radiate.  I also wind it funny that in
traveller something like the black globe is posible but a simpler system
that just works of IR is not discussed.  Seems to me the black glode could
be \'cut down\' in size and price to handle the heat problem nicely.  Perhaps
that IS why the fussion power plants are so effiecent.

Not exactly.  Radar is RF.  Copper conducters (or wave guides for high power
applications) carry the radar (RF) signal to the antenna.  It also reflects
the signal back if the target is copper.  This goes back to basic Smitt
charts and SWRs.  Conducters do reflect radar.  In fact if your system is
not properly turned the antenna itself can refect the signal back into the
transmitter at full power and burn out the transmiter.  Cutting the antenna
off a transmiter can cook the finals the first time you try to send,
depending on design and power levels.  Techs use \'dummy load\' durring tests
to prevent this.  When I did bussiness band radio the dummy load was a
gallon can of oil.  It got pretty warm pretty quick with the higher output
radios.

OBTraveller. An expensive quick sabatage would be to cut the antenna cables
while the system is not running.  When the operater turns on his active
radar set for the first time after this is done he smokes the finals for a
hefty repair bill. (1-6% minimum) of the cost of the radar unit for
replacement parts (if they are avaiable) plus the labor of course.  It is
posible to test for this condition without blowing the system on many good
systems with built in safegaurds.  Some systems do this automaticly.  Other
only do so if the operater start up the system in a curtain way.  Still
others have no way to test for this or safeties to prevent the overload.
About that black market mill. spec. Radar Unit...

Note that setting up a new RF system takes more that just your average
operaters knowledge.  Even a .1 inch gap in a wave guide and be enough to
trash a high power system with refected power.  or one loose connection.  or
using the wrong coax cable.  or any of several hundred other details that
can bite you in the butt.  I\'ve been bit and seen by boss at the time with
30 years experience get bit.   That black market unit DID come with
operater, maintainence, and INSTALLATION manuals didn\'t it?  They would all
be very large books (or several books each) and each very different for a
top of the line system.

It\'s strange, though.  I never had a problem explaining worlds in
canon.  Of course a world with an exotic atmosphere can have a local
TL of 2.  When you are an exporter of bulk gases, why would you try to
manufacture anything more advanced than a gas cylinder?  That\'s just
one quick off-the-cuff, knowing very little about the planet, but you
get my drift.  Most worlds are exploited to support the Rich, Ind and
Hi-Pops.  Especially on a frontier, a large number of the worlds are
hellholes with a very narrow use.  The changes you are proposing sound
as though they would preclude the occurance of virgin worlds. 
Homogenization is good for milk, but for Traveller?

Unfortunately, as I think was pointed out earlier, metallic character
increases down the periodic table - in what used to be group 4 we go
from carbon, to silicon, germanium, tin, and lead - quite definately
metals by the end.  Any "eka-lead" would also be a metal.  Carbon is
unique.

I tend to agree too...I\'m a GURPS fan and I\'m glad to see that they are 
publishing most of the Traveller stuff again...But I think they should 
main true to the canon.

Radar is composed of photons of electromagnetic radiation
just like light but a different frequency.

Your radar does not detect the electrons that it bounces off the
target, it detects the photons that it bounces off the target.

The difference is that the energy levels per photon are sufficiently
low that you can generate them easily by altering the energy state
of a weakly bound electron such as one in the conduction band
of a metal.

Light requires a higher energies, a level that would knock a
conduction band electron out of the metal altogether, so tends to
be emitted by transitions in the more closely bound electrons.

At this point I referred to active sensors, not just radar
By wideband, I did not mean 1.2GHz and 1.3GHz
I meant 1GHz, 10GHz, 100GHz, 1THz,...

Any energy generated by the power plant and the people on board is
converted to heat unless it is converted into weapons fire, thrust
or jump drive. Even then, these are not 100% efficient, so there will
be some heat generated.

To really get that IR signature down, you need to turn off the internal
gravity as well as the engines and the weapons.

A ship running minimal life support and a 100% black globe will explode
once its capacitors are full.

  Wouldn\'t this violate Conservation of Matter/Energy?  (he said, playing

  That\'d be a "global causality violation". And tends to have bad
  consequences. 


I do not see many ways in which time travel backwards in time can
happen without either violating conservation of matter/energy or
postulating multiple universes.

You send something back in time.  There is now more, or different,
matter at the time when it arrived.  The total amount of matter/energy
in the universe at that time has changed.

Another thing to consider -- you\'re passing information into the past.
I know very little about information theory.  If someone here does, is
there an equivalent to conservation of matter/energy which applies to
information here?



  *Local* casuality violations are things such as your future self
  dropping in for a short visit.  As long as you actually *do* make the
  visit, then the consequences aren\'t nearly as messy (in fact, you may
  not be able to *not* make the visit!).

Your future self comes for a visit.  You change your actions, so that
you go visit yourself, which you would not have done otherwise.  I
claim that this visit has the _same_ problems as the rock which is
picked up, sent back through time, and put down where it was/will be
picked up.


Hmm.  Much of this discussion is pointless because we haven\'t decided
on the "rules" for time travel.  Are there multiple universes?  Can
you break causality?  Are there limits to directions or distances one
can time travel?  What does it take to actually _do_ it?

Of course, one can also maintain that time travel machines don\'t
exist.  If they did, eventually some idiot would hop in a time travel
machine, go back, and kill the inventor before it gets finished.  So
all promising time-travel researchers mysteriously die before
finishing their projects.

Yeah.  They were cold blooded as well as siliconoid.  And Uller was a Uranoid

I\'ve seen plans for 400 ton interdiction sats.  I don\'t see a comsat as 
*needing* a sophont onboard it.  They\'d be pretty much throwaways; when they 
die, you send up a ship\'s boat or something and lob a new one out the airlock. 
 Same thing with a GPS or a weathersat.  About the only thing you\'d need plans 
for would be a weapons platform or a defense platform.

What you are forgetting is that if you send something back in time,
then that object travelling backwards in time will have existed all
the way back to the beginning of the universe. And starting and
stopping time travel should require the E=mc2 energy of whatever it
is you want to time travel.

The way I have seen it described for an electron is:

To travel back in time, the electron emits two gamma rays, each of
energy E = mc2. The two gamma rays allow the conservation of energy
and momentum.
In order to stop the electron moving backwards in time, it needs to
absorb a pair gamma rays of the correct energy.
Your electron now starts travelling forwards in time again.

IIRC, physics only only says that causality it statistically likely.
What it says about time travel is that mc2 is a heck of a lot of
energy. :-)

They need the Coyns *now*. They didn\'t need them 300,009 years ago. 
Then, after the final war, the surviving Droyne worlds started a long 
recession. Most lost the ability to caste, and probably all would 
have. Then, Grandfather returned 75,000 years ago, and introduced the 
Coyns as an *aid* to guarantee that 20-odd selected worlds would not 
lose the ability to caste.

AFAIK, that is already establishes as <ducking> canon.

Just wanted to put in my vote to keep an old-style planet generation
system.  The main advantage is that you don\'t screw up 20 years worth of
old Traveller sectors (it\'s not just the Marches that would have to be
defined as an "oddball", but many other places as well). The main
disadvantage (if you want to call it that) is that people have to come up
with reasons for low populations on apparently attractive worlds and high
pops on apparently unattractive worlds.  If you balance the two, the
advantage comes out way ahead IMO.

There are lots of arguments back and forth, of course, with one side
saying "but these worlds don\'t make sense!" and the other side saying "use
a little imagination!", but I think what gets lost in this is the
fundamental question of what an "attractive world" is.  

I think the view that everyone will want to flock to garden worlds is
terribly terra-centric.  IMO, if you grew up on a rockball, you will
almost certainly want to live on one.  The so-called "garden worlds" with
their bizarre fluctuations of temperature, lighting, and pressure, their
creepy-crawly _animals_ all over the place and so on are going to seem
just as alien to you as the moon seems to us Terrans.  Moving from your
underground base on Yorbund to a farm on Tarsus is going to involve alot
of changes you will not like!  There will be allergens to deal with that
you\'ve never encountered before, there will be the disturbing feeling of
being under open sky without your vacc suit, there will be stepping in a
Nobble turd, etc., etc., etc.

To put it briefly, people get used to the place they live and won\'t want
to go elsewhere!  Why do 10 billion people live on a rockball?  Because
they\'re used to it and they like it.  Why do they live in the middle of a
toxic soup?  Because if they moved away, they\'d leave all their friends,
family, and culture. Besides, the colors of the autumnal acid showers are
just SO lovely and they\'d get homesick for them in a minute! 

I\'m very worried that by making the G:T system tend towards planets that
"make sense" you\'re going to create a huge universe of boring worlds where
all the garden planets are basically Earth and all the rockballs are
basically Luna.  Dull! 

My .02 Cr worth...
Charles.

We are already getting to the point where machine code will be
too complex to write because you have to work out the possible
code schedules depending of the results of each test.
Alternatively the hardware might be running what we would call a
high level language as its machine code.

The comptuer tech is likely to be very different from today,
but a simple example. As I understand it, Neural nets are programmed
by a feedback loop, not by hacking the machine code any more
than I would program a processor by changing its microcode
(the stuff that runs the machine code).

That the computer rules were written in 1977 ? :-)

What might be appropriate is Asimov\'s Robot psychiatrist <sp?>
characters who have to "debug" the robots by talking to them
and understanding their problems, not by printing out their
source code.

No it doesn\'t.

I\'ll admit it\'s tedious to do by hand, and if anyone tried doing it
regulalrly  they\'d very quickly design some sort of machine to help
them, like say the Enigma machine, but I did 24-bit RSA encryption by
hand as part of my university training in 1989

The maths is really quite simple, the hard part is finding two large
enough prime numbers, and large prime numbers are definitely findable
by hand, just very tedious again.

Of coruse we only encrypted and decrypted a small two word message.

  Apparently. IIRC, they already know that the calculations get more complex
as the atoms that you\'re fiddling with do; for modelling interactions of
designer molecules it will almost never be useful, as you\'d have to schedule
the comp model many years before you got to physically testing that combo -
and that\'s with theoretical photonic super-comps. Or so I\'m told.

Rob Prior described them as \'anti-personnel weapons\' in the last beta of GT

I disagree. Totally.

<rant>

As GT has used CT data, GT\'s new world generation system should produce
similar distributions and results to the original LBBs (note I don\'t say Bk
6 here). Otherwise you drop internal consistancy - if you\'re not going to
get similar results you may as well use GURPS Space\'s system for generation.

Unless, of course, you\'re proposing to invalidate CT material like the
Solomani Rim and the AM material?

I don\'t mind if the expanded sysgen stuff invalidates the star type, but
blowing the PBG type figures and other data like the UPP distribution is
worse than IG\'s actions. At least in their case it was a programming error
combined with a lack of proofreading. To set out to produce a non-backwards
UPP compatible system seems to be a way of irritating people no end.

It\'s a game and I\'d rather have the quirks in the UPPs than rewrite the
whole basis for the rest of the published background *and* combine that
with a bloody great handwave for the Marches.

I feel better for that. Martin, it wasn\'t meant to be personal....

Last I heard your car radio picks up EM radiation not photons.  It could be
a problem of simantics.  Last I checked 100Mhz FM was not a photonic system
but one based soully on electrical potential.  Are photons somehow part of
FM radio?  Was this a detail my professors left out?  None of my Radio
Amature Handbooks mention it.  Nor did any of my Broadcast Communications
text books.  But then it could be a case of simplification.  Neither goes
into quantum mechanics though.  My text books say the electrons are radiated
from antennas and recieved by antennas.  To be honest it\'s been so long
sence my theory classes the actual mechanic escapes me.  I am an applied
science person after all.

It\'s those weakly bound electrons being radiated that make radio waves.

I do not understand the above paragraph.  Are you saying to make light you
have to strip the inner electrons?

Why would you search in the above frequency ranges?  These are in the
uplink/downlink bands.  You are looking at a lot of interferience.  You also
have very limited range and a narrow search field.  These are more like
short range targeting radars not spherical search radar.  Your power
requirements is going to be huge!

Not exactly true or false either.  Once you close the loop and are running
everything off of the capacitors you end up with zero gain except for gain
from outside the system like sunlight.  You have X in the capatitors.  You
use that X to power your systems and eventually it returns to the
capacitors.  Closed loop.  Total system power = total power.  Your time
\'under black globe\' would be dependant on where you are in the system.  If
at the orbit of pluto you could be there for centuries before the boom if
you have the capacitors of a J6 drive plus your weapons capacitors.

I\'ll check at my hobby shop.  They have a lot of older stuff.  They also

One thing to note. I am using custom hulls from Gurps Vehicles, and for
military designs I have used heavy frame strength most of the time
(doubles hull HP, but adds to mass and cost). This is legal, according
to the sidebar on p155 of GT, and makes military vessels a little more
resilient than an equivalent civilian vessel.

Notes:

The Akari class scout is used exclusively by the Imperial Navy and
Imperial Interstellar Scout Service as a passive scout useful for
deep penetration, recon and scouting missions. Apart from the
standard sensor suite built into the ships bridge, it carries a
powerful and expensive sensor and electronic warfare suite,
typically found on ships MUCH larger.

The Akari typically jumps into the outer system, then relies on its
stealth and greater sensor range to remain hidden.  From this vantage,
it can perform reconnaissance missions without being discovered.
Powerful active sensors and jammers, along with long legs (6G plus)
will allow the Akari to avoid confrontation even it is discovered or
observed.

Over 300 Akari class scouts have been constructed, and many are
assigned to trouble spots of the Imperium, such as the Spinward
Marches and the Solomani Rim.  They are not available for sale to
civilians, and any civilians caught in the posession of these ships
would have some questions to answer (if they were caught...)

The Kishig class Fleet Ordinance Transport carries supplies and
ordinance
sufficient to allow continued operations for attached units in enemy
teritory, or when access to resupply via a naval base is not practical.
It is a venerable class, and fulfils a critical aspect of the Imperial
Navy\'s fleet operations.

The Kishig can be attached as part of the Auxiliary Division of a Batron
or CruRon, or it may form part of its own supply squadron.

Gunnery crew also double as cargo movers when required.

Named after the Terran animal reknowned for it\'s ability to hold
water, this massive Fuel Tender is a common sight in Imperial Navy
task groups and squadrons, providing fuel gathering and refining
services to accompanying vessels.  It has the legs to keep up with
other ships in it\'s group and carries enough fuel onboard, and enough
fuel shuttles, to refuel itself and it\'s "children" as quickly as
possible.  A massive 88% of it\'s entire volume is given over to fuel
tanks, processing equipment and fuel shuttles.  It is always heavily
escorted, and never left to fend for itself, even though it has plenty
of laser and sandcaster turrets for its own defence.

This particular class of fuel tender is relatively new, and the first
vessel of the class, Camel, was commissioned in 1086.  Since then,
over 250 ships have entered IN service, named after similar life forms
found within the Imperium.

Different Bruce here, but this I can handle...FM Radio and the green
light coming off that neon sign there are simply different frequencies
along the electromagnetic spectrum. A photon is a unit of
electromagnetic energy. When your radio antenna picks up a signal it is
doing so because of the interaction between the electromagnetic
properties of radio wavelength photons and your recieving circuit. When
your eye detects a rose, it is doing so because of the interaction
between the electromagnetic properties of red wavelength photons and
your recieiving circuit, which is electrochemical in nature rather than
completely electronic as in the radio.

That light was a part of the electromagnetic spectrum, along with radio
waves was the conceptual leap that revolutionized physics in the late
19th century, and laid the framework for Einsteins Theory of Relativity,
just as the conclusion that electrons also displayed wavelike and
particle like activity (deBroglie? Heisenberg? ) that usered in quantum
physics, and the understanding of _how_ an appropriately excited
electron could cause electromagnetic radiation to be errr...radiated.

Radio is technically photons. However, that\'s not a very useful way of 
looking at them.

While one might mentally picture photons as a stream of little billiard balls,
that\'s not always true. Photons are really tiny little packets of 
electromagnetic energy -as a photon goes by you see an electric and magnetic
field wobble back and forth very briefly. It wobbles at a characteristic 
frequency depending on the kind of radiation - or you can see it as having
a characteristic wavelength. 

For photons with very short wavelengths - like visible light - the wobbly-waveness
isn\'t very relevant; the wavelenth is small compared to most real-world objects
so you just treat them as billiard balls. For long wavelengths like radio,
though, the waveness becomes crucial to understanding them, and there are so
many individual photons involved that they all sort of add together - so you
can just see it as a continuous sea of electromagnetic fields; if you stand
in one place as radio waves are beamed at you you can just treat it as a 
continuous electric field going up and down and up and down at the 
frequency of the radio signal.

This is the core of quantum mechanics - things are both particles and waves
at the same time.

Radio signals certainly don\'t radiate electrons. Instead, electrons move up
and down inside the broadcasting antenna. This makes an electric and magnetic
field that wobbles up and down and travels out from the antenna - kind of 
like if you pushed a piece of wood up and down in the water, waves wou
travel out. In the recieving antenna, the electric field makes the electrons
in the reciever again move up and down in synch with the ones in the 
transmitter - kind of like the water wave coming to a second piece of wood and
making it float up and down. The *effects* you see are on the pieces of wood,
but it\'s not as if the pieces of wood travel from one place to another.
Similarly the effects you see in radio are on the electrons, but electrons
aren\'t travelling.

So it is a matter of simantics and quantum mechanics as I thought.  The
photon is the \'medium\' of exchange.  Is the photon the quantum of energy?
Is it the smallest postible unit of energy?  Or is there a smaller \'packet\'
of energy?

It\'s interesting to note how small even the biggest of these beasties
are. GT battleships could easily mount scanners with 70,000,000 mile ranges
or more...

Presumably a non-streamlined ship wouldn\'t have to put its sensors in a pop

Mike, Eric, and the TML in general,

Yep, I\'m still here, and still waiting on Bill Keith to return the
autographed covers. I\'ve contacted Andrew twice, and he has reminded Bill
twice, but to date, still no UPS driver knocking on my door with them. :(

I\'m going to give it one more week before I start pulling my hair out.

I\'m in a bit of a quandary as to what to do if Bill doesn\'t return them -
Would you folks be willing to settle for un autographed copies? Hopefully,
it won\'t come to that, but I really don\'t know what else to do - I *really*
want to get this project wrapped up and over with (it\'s been fun, but I am
over it!).

If and when I get the covers back, it will take me about two weeks to
bind/trim/ship the orders. One way or the other (autographed or un
autographed), they will be in the mail by the first week of March.

As for your specific question Mike, yes, I still have around 30 unsold
copies per my agreement with Marc. If you\'d like to order one, then please
contact me off the list at my email address which is: timmon@primenet.com

This is beginning to sound like a mantra, but, again, I am sorry for the
delay folks, and am working to resolve it as swiftly as possible. Also,
thanks again to everyone for their patience.

Cordially,
Paul Sanders

P.S. Andrew informs me that his newest novel is on the bookstore shelves -
it is titled "False Colors", and is set in the Wing Commander universe. It
was "co-authored" with William Forstchen (Andrew wrote 95% of it). Be aware
that some lamer (and now a former employee) at Baen Books incorrectly put
William Keith\'s name on the cover - but it is Andrew\'s work. I bought it
and am presently into the first few chapters - it is looking good and I
highly recommend it.

Thank you.  That was almost exactly how it was originaly explained to me
years ago and then the prof. said to forget it and look at it like an EE.
The quantum mechanics of it are not real useful in designing real world
applications.  EEs have their own mathamatical methods of modeling such
things that let us do our jobs.  Most of those methods deal with modeling
the properties of currents and those things that effect currents.  One thing
that always gives me trouble with the \'unified field theory\' and that
photons are what make up all the EMS is the drastic differences between the
ways that IR, visible light, and radio signals behave in the world.  You can
not treat them alike when you are designing equipment.  I can EM shield out
radio interferience but that does nothing to stop gamma radiation or IR or
light.  In the real world there are no \'black globes\'.  I\'d love to be able
to phaze cancel heat.  I\'d make a fortune in the air-conditioning busness!

No, you said it very well.  I\'m short of articulation ability today.  I\'m

upon what you hope to achieve). The energy of a photon can be measured in
different units... let me think about this... Joules, electron-volts and...
what?

Thinking about photons as small lumps of energy is not really useful when
dealing with radio-frequency waves. It\'s best applied to short-wavelength
waves such as light and gamma rays.

There was a comment a while back about not being able to cancel a light
signal by phase shift. I seem to dimly remember that interferometry deals
with precisely that - the interaction of two light waves to cancel one
another out in places. This requires polarised or coherent light, so isn\'t
really feasable for an Invisibility Device.

My memory on this is dim, but tha above seems to make sense.

No problem. In fact I\'m beginning to agree with you. I was sort of
suggesting that First In should allow for the oddballs to come up
*sometimes* but generally produce more sensible worlds - sort of a halfway
house between a full "fix" and a "leave it as is"

But hey, now I think about it:

1. If dopes like me and Neil can explain the oddball worlds , anyone can.
2. It\'s canon.
3. It stays interesting.

So, for the record: I HAVE CHANGED MY MIND. FIRST IN SHOULD PARALLEL THE LBB
SYSTEM.

After all; you don\'t get to choose what the world lying at that ideal
trade-link point will be like in real life, do you?


Maybe the stellar data should be updated for current theory, though.

Built to be the centerpiece for the defense of the Domain of Deneb, the
Plankwell-class battleship is considered by many Naval observers to be the
best example of modern capital ship design.

The class breaks the traditional mold of Imperial battleships by placing
heavy emphasis on it\'s missile batteries.  Fired in volley, a Plankwell can
fire an astonishing 640 missiles in a single action.  This rate of fire can
be sustained for hours due to large magazines.  For most missions, the
standard ASM-37P "Detail" missile is stored, though other models may be
carried based on the ship\'s mission.

This isn\'t to say that the Plankwell skimps on energy weaponry.  The main
ship-killing weapon is the 100k-Mj Spinal Meson Gun, along with numerous
laser batteries for both offense and close-in anti missile defense.  The
class\' particle accelerator array is three triple mounted 256-Mj torodial
weapons.  These weapons are limited to a secondary role against enemy
cruiser, or in surface bombardment of airless worlds.  It is thought that
later versions of the class will omit the PA bays in favor of additional
defenses.

The ship itself is a long, blocky monolith nearly 400 meters long.  The
vessel is divided into three distinct sections, the engineering hull, the
crew hull, and the weaponry hull, with the last being offset from the first
two to allow the muzzle of the MG to clear.  As their names suggest, the
ship\'s functions are divided between the various hulls.

The engineering section contains the ship\'s drives and power plant.  The
ship is rated for Jump-4, and can make 4g acceleration.  A secondary set of
thrusters are available for emergencies, and can generate .4g.  A back-up
power plant can provide power for essential systems (life support, sensors,
etc.,.) while the crew makes repairs to the main systems.

The crew section contains the bulk of the ship\'s living spaces.  The crew
is housed in fairly spacious quarters, and ever effort has been made to
give each crewman a space of his own, where he can "get away from the
Navy."  The nine dining facilities serve surprisingly good food, and are
the envy of the fleet.  The crew section also contains the ship\'s bridges.
There are two: the running bridge, contained in a tower on the vessel\'s
port side, allowing day-to-day operations with a view of the outside.  The
other bridge is the Combat Command Center, which is deep in the heart of
the ship.  CCC is where the full command center of the ship is found, and
is manned at all times, even when the command staff is on the running
bridge.  CCC is actually several different areas, such as Sensor Control,
Gunnery Control, Engineering Control, all of which report to the Officer of
the deck, who sits in the center of all the action.

The weapons hull contains the ship\'s armament, as described above.  In
desperate actions, a Plankwell commander can jettison the weapons hull.
This act raises the performance of the engines to an amazing 11.6g!  To
make use of this power, all crew members must be strapped down, and no
maneuvering can be attempted.  It is a way to get out of a bad fight quickly.

While the Plankwell is streamlined, it is not design to make any sort of
planetary landing, and any touchdown would be catastrophic at best.
Interface is handled by the four 40dt pinnaces and two 95dt shuttlecraft.
One of the pinnaces is outfitted to IMF standards, and is used by the
on-board Marine platoon as a recovery craft.  Even with the onboard
compliment, personnel transfer is very slow, and liberty call is usually
accomplished via the aid of local assets.

When the class was proposed, there was great controversy surrounding the
choice of Grand Admiral Olav haut-Plankwell for the class.  Remembered as a
hero in the Spinward Marches for his defeat of the Zhodani in the First
Frontier War, he is reviled elsewhere as the instigator of the Civil War.
At the time the class was being tested, the Fourth Frontier War had just
ended, and the naming of the class may have been a message to the Iridium
Throne "ignore us at your peril."

Operationally, the Plankwell is a single mission platform.  It is a ship
killer.  The class has none of the flexibility seen in other battleships,
but in giving up that flexibility, it becomes that much more lethal.
Plankwell BatRons are organized around two Plankwells, with several
supporting cruisers and escorts.  In wartime, it is envisioned that
Plankwell equipped BatRons would form the heart of the line of battle, and
carry the fight directly to the enemy fleet.  Another possibility is using
Plankwells as raiders, sending them deep into Out World Coalition territory
to destroy orbital starports and shipyards.

Whatever the mission, the sophonts who crew these mighty ships have come up
with an unofficial nickname for their charges: "Kaddushaggur", or "God\'s
Own Hammer."

>signal from a ship in stutterwarp?


Yes. The ship is always in real space. A "moving" stutterwarp ship is
jumping from one point in spacetime to another along its flight path, but
these jumps are instantaneous, taking no time whatsoever. In the intervals
between jumps, while in realspace, the ship could transmit its EM signals
for communications, sensors, and all of that.

This is borne out by the rules in that _Star Cruiser_ ships can detect each
other, communicate and remote control missiles while using stutterwarp
drives.

Of course, this is only of real use in a significant gravity well, where
stutterwarp drives are limited to sublight pseudovelocities. Ships at
translight speeds in deep space cannot talk to one another unless they stop
to transmit, because they would outrun the signals.

I imagine there might be a doppler-shift effect or somesuch (my brain would
hurt if I thought about *that* too much), but nothing that couldn\'t be
compensated for.


>Also, what is the range of speeds for 2300AD in stutterwarp?  What would an
>average 2300AD ship above fighter size speed be?


IIRC, the average was about 2 ly a day. The JFK Cruisers were noted to be
really fast warships with an efficiency of over 4 ly a day. As with other
versions of Traveller, fighters are not faster than warships, but fit the
"patrol boat" model often cited on this list.


>Could someone also give me an idea of what an average distance between
>habitable planets in two different systems might be?


Mmm. Can\'t help you there, except to say that it would be the distance
between the systems\' main stars plus or minus a little bit (a couple of
AUs).


>Given this, how long would it take an average (above fighter size) speed
>2300AD ship to get to another habitable planet an average interstellar
>distance away?


IIRC, the travel time between systems is a matter of days and hours.


>How long would it take a light speed transmission from the origin planet to
>get to the destination planet?


A number of years equal to the distance between the two in light years, of
course. ;-)

Well, I actually *do* have a Model 3, a 3P to be exact. Would anyone
like to pay Traveller prices for it...credits converted to dollars at
the standard 1 to 5, of course. ;-p

I\'d even throw in the disk with the BASIC Traveller software, from the
JTAS, that I typed in many years ago.

Hmm. Good question. If you are thinking that TTL equals *production*
capacity, then probably none too high (maybe TTL 3-7???) If you are
thinking TTL equals the level of technology that Mr. Joe average colonist
has access to, it is probably about TTL 10 to TTL 12 (with no gravitics and
better computers, of course).


>How about a world inbetween a frontier world and a core world?


About the same as above. 2300AD colonies are pretty closely tied to the
Earth and/or Beta Canum (was it Beta Canum? I cannot remember the name of
the "other" 2300AD core world anymore) in a lot of ways.


>Okay, what if we are talking about 2500AD, now?


Your guess is as good as anyone elses. If technology slows down to the
regular Traveller universe pace, probably +1 TL at most. IMHO, it would be
more like TTL 17-18 -- but that\'s just me.

Yes, but the signal is going to be chopped all to hell.

For the rest of your questions, I know there is a 2300AD list out there,

I *used* to have a couple TRS CoCo 2\'s and a CoCo3.  Great lil machines, 
especially when you ran them on OS9.  I remember watching tv one day, when 
Bill Gates was announcing to teh world that you needed at *LEAST* 4 megs of 
RAM to multitask.  I hadda laugh, because at the time, I was downloading a 
piece of software off CIS, in another virtual terminal I was unpacking it, in 
a *third* virtual terminal, I was going through the README file, in the 
*fourth* terminal, I was editing the binary, all the while I was printing out 
the documentation on my old Epson MX-80.

Funniest thing about it was, I was doing all this in *64K*!

I never got around to typing them in.  But then again, I\'ve always been a

Ships have a sw effieciency stated in light years per day I think it is.
(24hrs).
The higher the eff the more light years in a day.
The fastest big ship is around  4, I think.
Fighters tend to be 3+ in their eff., but lack the range to travel very far.
Fighters endurance is usually measured in hours rather than weeks for large
ships.


>Could someone also give me an idea of what an average distance between

There is a good program "warp" that calculates this for 2300.

For 2300, 7.7 light years is the maximum. After that you have to enter a
gravity well and discharge your drive, if you don\'t  then "BOOM"

I would say 3 days.
At least. That does not quite include the 40 hours to discharge the drives

Depends on how many light years apart they are.

Ah.  The dayside maximum is 212.4, the nightside minimum is 49.  The high
atmospheric pressure retains heat fairly well, I suppose.

The atmosphere is listed as Corrosive, so that\'s where I\'m starting from.

It\'s true that the worldbuilding rules in First In will not always give you
the same results as the CT system when you\'re working from scratch.
That\'s deliberate -- I\'m a member of the school that thinks that if you\'re
going to include more detail, you might as well do it in such a way as
to make the results more plausible.

On the other hand, a secondary (but important) goal of the design is
to make it reasonably easy to "reverse-engineer" the canonical material.
If I do my job right, you ought to be able to take any world generated by
the CT system and place it in a full star system with as much supporting
detail as you want.

So the canon material won\'t be "broken" by FIRST IN.  Bent a little, at
most.

(Incidentally, another secondary goal has been to *not* alter the CT
system significantly if there\'s no compelling reason to.  At the very
least, there will be an optional rule that will allow you to do things
the old way where possible.)

So chill, folks.  And come take part in the playtest if you can.  You
might as well make your objections on what the text actually says,
while there\'s still time to make changes.

I disagree with you to some extent about programming languages being
considered archaic.  After all, humans are _also_ verbally-oriented
critters, and will likely remain so.  It therefore seems quite possible
that programming languages will continue to play a role in computer
usage.  Perhaps not a dominant one, but a role nonetheless.

The thing is, the only thing that is "heavy canon" is the UWP
profile.  The LLB system is actually pretty short and could be
given as one alternate.  OTOH, for a GM to do what the
current system is aiming to do (generate worlds that match
what is known about planetary evolution today) would very hard
for most GMs.  For GMs who would prefer to I think it would be good not to
loose that material.

A nitpick, but actually TWO deckplans at least!  ;-)

Both are in licensed materials, not GDW. One is the Eshpridar (?? sp??)
from _Adventure Class Ships Vol 2_, the other is an interdiction satellite
from an old GW publication - can\'t remember the name now, I just remember
it included the Vargr tradeboat, close to the ugliest ship ever designed
for Traveller. The Marava trader and Luriani (sp?) Scout explorer have
*nothing* on this design. Build THAT one, Jesse, and we\'ll give you an MCG!
(The SEH is reserved for a model & plans of the Tigress... ;-)

I agree with Charles. I think these things add colour into the game. Like
the mining grav APC from Far Traveller (well, I *think* it\'s FT) or the
spider-like orbital cargo handler (FT again, I think?), etc... Often the
third-party people seemed to have more imagination or go further "out
there" with their designs than GDW did.

	Exsqueeze me? Radar is an electromagnetic phenomenon, and hence is
involves photons, just like visible light. Only difference is the

	You\'re really losing it now. Both radar and light are waveforms. You
CAN cancel light with phase shift--that\'s how you get interference
patterns, holograms, etc .... The problem with using the technique as
stealth is what a previous poster mentioned--by the time your fancy
stealth gear measures the incoming signal (via an antenna ...),
determines the frequency, phase, and amplitude, and generates an
exactly opposite signal, millions of wavecrests have already
reflected back to the enemy, telling him exactly where you are.

	It works better with sound because electronics are fast enough/sound
is slow enough.

	I\'ll disclaim the knowledge of RF filters. But I do know some

light, which can be modelled either as a particle (the photon ...) or
as a waveform, or even as a geometric ray, depending on the level of
detail and what you\'re doing.

	This subject has been absolutely beat to death. It doesn\'t MATTER
what the power plant is, so it doesn\'t matter that we can\'t build
them. Just the power output. And we do know the power output of
Traveller starships. That energy MUST eventually be radiated away
from the vessel. Again, fundamental physics.

	Even with your powerplant off, if it\'s inhabited the ship MUST be
around 290K. And basic physics can tell you what it\'s radiating.
Mostly IR. Ask Bruce Macintosh, one of our resident IR experts (as an
IR astronomer, probably the most qualified member of this list to
discuss passive sensors and space applications ...)

I wouldn\'t go that far.  Otherwise, all our user interfaces
would look like geisha girls.  :-)

As a present day example, take a look at Visual C++ and
Visual Basic.  Both make windows programs, both have similar
development environments.  But, the net results can be
significantly different in performance and complexity to code.

In our future scenario, the entry level programmer can assemble
several modules and bind them to make functional programs.  But,
each of those modules has tons of excess baggage in the form
of error handling codes and such.  This extra code makes them
generic and bullet-proof, but the cost in more resources and
speed.  The advance programmer will work with the components
that make up the modules and build a streamlined version that
does the job faster and with fewer computing resources.

While visual metaphors may exist, I imagine most work horse
programming would be in the form of scripts that call pre-
built functions.  It\'s quicker and cheaper than rolling your
own custom functions.

Well, none of this negates the verbal (programming language) paradigm. 
A possible melding of the visual and verbal programming realms, based on
levels of Computer skill, could be (footnotes refer to Windows 95
analogy):

Computer-0:  Can use prewritten programs after familiarization [1]

Computer-1:  Can familiarize self with prewritten programs without
outside instruction; can perform basic troubleshooting; can program
using standardized modules based on single paradigm [2]

Computer-2:  Can perform intermediate troubleshooting; can program using
standardized modules based on alternate paradigm [3]

Computer-3+: Can perform advanced troubleshooting; can program using any
known paradigm [4]

[1]  Most of my co-workers are at this level.  They can use some of the
obvious features of Win 3.11/Win 95, and associated applications, once
someone demonstrates those features.

[2]  This is the "proficient user" degree of skill.  I am at this
level.  I can teach myself to use standard features of Win 3.11/Win 95
and common office applications, help my co-workers with basic
troubleshooting, and use DOS batch files and Win 95 shortcuts to
streamline some basic activities.  (In Milieu 1100, text-based DOS
equivalents may be more esoteric, but there will be tools of
proportionate power that are available to proficient users.) 

[3]  At this level, one can earn a living as a programmer.  In the
Windows setting, these programmers can use multiple tools, such as C,
C++, VB, and Java, as well as (if needed) older tools such as DOS batch
files.

[4]  At this point, a programmer will at very least display perform the
above-mentioned tasks with greater skill.  They may also experiment,
with varying degrees of success, with developing entirely new means of
programming (such as using VR to "build" a process).  Additional
abilities are left to the individual referee to judge.

Yes, but coming up with \'good\' alien races, and not humans in rubber suits,
can put a big strain on your creativity.  After a while, the new races start
looking like they dropped out of Star Trek.

For one of my better races (at least well received) I used this trick.  They
had a multisector empire nearly a million years ago, built with sublight
ships.  For unknown, and to humans probably unknowable, reasons, they fell
into barbarism.  That took care of plenty of worlds with next to no
atmosphere or water, and being seperated for so long, each could have as
distinct a culture and even physiology as I had time to think up.

But, this is what I wanted to know.  The randomness of the CT system forces
you to come up with ideas and situations.  The G:T system looks (at first
and very quick) glance to be like the 2300AD system, which I loved.  Which
one to use?  Both.

Good one, I\'ll be using that.  I remember that TL was an indicator of local
conditions, but I always ignored that and went this route.  Just locally
manufactored items reflects TL, unless the plot calls for overall low tech
available.  Otherwise those TL 2 barbarians, if human, actually inhabit a
First Imperium military complex, they\'ve just forgotten the tech of their
ancestors.  Yes, clich, when you stop and think about it, but who has time

No, just make a more plausible corelation between habitat and population.  I
agree with Kevens\' post about garden worlds.  They should be even less
hospitable than, say, the Moon.  On the Moon you have to bring all your life
forms, so you know what you get (mostly).  On a garden planet with a
compatiable biosphere you should have billions of hidden dangers, some that
show up right away, some that might take decades or even centuries to
manifest.
The danger of homogenization under this system is present, but you\'ll have
to look at the details yourself.  Either check out the files or wait and
buy the book.

Best thing I\'ve heard all day.

Plug in the mainworld and the asteroid belts and gas giant numbers for the
canon sectors.  Build the rest of the system with FI, and flesh out that
mainworld with the details in FI.  Change the color of the sun if need be,
that doesn\'t effect the cost of SDBs.

If you want, generate your own sectors with FI.  Or CT, but since I don\'t
have the LBBs anymore, and don\'t see too much reason to get them, I\'ll be
using FI.

Just remember this...Computers have existed for about 50-55 years. Compilers
for about 45, high level languages for a bit less (COBOL and FORTRAN were
invented in what, the late 50\'s?). Certainly less than a single lifetime.

Traveller is set 3000+ years from now.

Computer programming in Traveller is to computer programming now as
interactive CD\'s are to Babylonian cunieform tablets.

Or to make a more probable analogy, as a fish is to a bicycle.

Yes, there are differences between Visual C++ and Visual Basic in performance.
But we\'re sort of like two cavemen sitting around arguing about which color
flint will be used for the tools to construct the Space Station.

It is rather unlikely that a Traveller programmer would even recognize what we
are doing as programming a computer, and vice versa.

To us, it might be more like lying on a massage table, drafting a blueprint,
sculpting a figure, machining an abstract shape, or singing an aria, quite
probably nothing like any of those. Possibly like ALL of those, it would
depend on the tools the programmer prefers, the style they do best. 

There are already software tools that let you edit sound as a visual
phenomenon. (A sound editor, by the primary programmer behind Bryce...you use
photoshop-ish tools on a visual representation of the sound) 

It most probably will NOT look like someone sitting at a terminal typing set
words and symbols in a line.

That it will be a skill, there is no doubt, and generalized ideas of what
differing skill levels allow you to do are useful, but please...lets not kid
ourselves that the differences between VBasic and VC++ are even slightly
resolvable from the viewpoint of someone writing programs in the year 5560. 

As for the analogy, currently beloved by CSC faculty, that programming will
eventually be a concrete discipline like engineering bridges, I\'m not so sure
that that is the case. Bridge-building can be automated to a large extent.
Building bridges is almost certainly reducible to a computer program, once we
know enough variables. It\'s sort of like chess...there are fixed rules.

Building a bridge that\'s esthetically pleasing as well as functional...well,
that\'s another thing entirely, and is where the skills of a truly great
engineer come into play. But it\'s not the functionality that they\'re
\'programming\' into the bridge, but the esthetics.

It\'s more than likely that computer programming could turn out to be the same.

What if the best analogy is rather that it turns out to be more like writing
novels? Something that can be taught, certainly. Something that can be done by
a large number of people of average skill...yes, look at the history of bad
literature. Something that changes with the whims of public taste, yes.
Something that is difficult to do really well? Certainly. Look at the much
scanter history of good literature.

Always keep in mind that we\'re talking about a time and place that is as far
removed from our experience as the ancient Egyptians are from us. This is a
generally good rule to keep in mind whenever you consider what life, for
instance, on Mora or better yet, Glisten may be like...

After all, look what they thought 1999 would be like in 1962...

Isn\'t Traveller all about what they thought 1999 would be like in 1962?

Assuming that EE means "Elecrical Engineer" ....

Hmm, in power electronics, maybe.  I rarely ever used currents except
when the TTL loads got high and we had to check fanouts. Now that TTL
is out, even that\'s not a problem.

Yes, you can, if you think about it correctly.

The "drastic differences" are a result of the drastic differences in
the reaction of terrestrial substances to the diffferences in
frequency, not a fundamental difference in the properties of the
radiation.

You can also shield out light, gama radiation and IR, using different
forms of shielding, those that work at the apropriate frequencies

If I was you, I\'d modify that to "there are no black globes yet".

Many people didn\'t believe you could cancel perceived and measured
_sound_  before it was conclusively demonstrated to be possible.

It\'s quite possible that one could phase cancel heat in atmosphere, if
you are only talking about infra-red _radiation_, but heat in
atmosphere is not just radiation.

In a vacuum, it may be much easier.

What a lot of people don\'t realize that a computer programming is a two
part disicpline. The first (today) is the art of using tools to code a
program. The second is the knowledge of the problem you are trying to
code. In every good program there was some designer that knew how to do
the problem without the computer. To write accounting you need knowledge
of accounting to write a Trav character generator you neeed  a knowledge
of traveller.

In 3000 years the coding of a problem will be greatly automated. The
expertise will still come in how to use those greatly automated tools to
solve a problem. In addition many common problems will be solved. In the
imperium I am sure they have a series of components that solves the
problem of accounting and the accounting problem will have been understood
enough to be broken into reusable components.

Larry Niven wrote a short story based on this concept. In a later essay,
he explains why he doesn\'t like these "sideways in time" stories: they
screw up the laws of probability.

If I roll a six-sided die, six universes exist: one for each possible
outcome. However, if the die is loaded, one of the universes should be
more "probable" than the other five. However, in the "sideways in time"
concept, that just doesn\'t matter. All outcomes are equally likely.

In the current campaign, the Computer expert is always atempting to use
"shareware lawyering programs" which are quite serviceable for filling in
various forms and such, but the detail Walter had in his message is right
out.

However, applying the knowledge base along *with* a character with Legal-2
and all those various laws from various planets become more understandable.
Maybe not to the extent of letting the characters know which NPCs to bribe
and how much, but perhaps routing around that whole sequence in "The
Traveller Adventure".

But don\'t forget to slap fairly high subscription fees for each new data
chit needed for each new planet.  And the shareware timer *will* tend to
run out at the most inopportune moment.

The Trav Tech list request address is trav-tech-request@qrc.com
send a message withthe word "subscribe" (without quotes, of course) in the
body of the message.

The Deckplan list and CT list are egroups and can be subscribed to at;
http://www.egroups.com/list/deckplans/
and
http://www.eGroups.com/list/classic-traveller

They are pretty inactive after the first spurt of traffic.

There was an ISBA list (one of the few I didn\'t subscribe to I think) but I
suspect it is not active at the moment either.

Actually, they\'re moving away from OO & GUI. OO is passe. Patterns are where
it\'s at. (This is tongue firmly in cheek - every new advance in computer
programming/software development has been built on top of the advance that
came before it. A lot of OO development relies on good structured/functional
development principles. OO, however, is not the latest advance, although
it\'s not yet the computer equivalent of an oil deposit)

If you want an interesting look at where computers might go, check out
http://www.acm.org/cacm/AUG96/antimac.htm - natural language interfaces will
be a major innovation in the next few years probably. Holographics will be
the obvious choce for displays, whenever they\'re invented. The modern
"desktop" metaphor of interacting with a computer may disappear in our
lifetime though - the article gives a number of interesting reasons &
arguments.

The vision of talking to the computer and having the computer talk back will
someday become a reality (though probably only for a portion of all
human-computer interactions).

First, several other people have said the the photonic model is not the best
way to model radar.  Second, today\'s electronics work at very high speeds.
I am not talking about digital.  I mean analog.  A radio intercepts and
processes radio waves in real time.  Responce time is much less than .5
wavelength in the radio/radar band, which is all that is required for phaze
canceling.  Light on the otherland is not a doable with today technology to
the extent that invisibility is posible.  If light, IR, could be canceled
macroscopically then airconditioning would need near 0 power and cost nearly
nothing.

True, (I took part in that \'doing to death\') the other part of this post
delt with a limited black globe effect.  That was what I was refering to.  A
device that absorbed only part of the spectrum to allow ships to appear cool
while using the absorbed energy to power its\' systems without needing to use
the main power plant.  This post or part of the post has apparently been
sniped or separated form this.  I was brain storming at the time and the
order may have gotten rearranged.  Also if the grid can produce \'phase
shifted signals\' to cancel incoming lidar like the original poster supposed
it could also produce a signal to cancel its\' own ir signature.  I\'m sorry
if I rambled or was not clear.  Or perhaps I am confussing posts and mixing
discussions.

Also, are you saying that if you built a 4 man habitat in the center of a 2
mile diameter asteroid that the asteroid would reach 290K in any reasonable
time?  You are leaving out surface area and thermal mass.  The heat from a 4
man outpost will never heat 100,000 tons of nickle, iron, and silicon to
290k.  If that were true the entire earth would have the same temperture as
the core and we\'d be very dead.

TTL is not \'out\' in the control world, and fanout can still be a problem
even with cmos and its\' other newer relatives in large systems.  Also track
length can be a facter when it approches .25 of system\'s clock wave lenght
and becomes an antenna.  Also propagation delay times can become critical
with gate loading and edge triggering for data latching.  All of these are
formulations that need to be checked or tested or better yet both in a new
design.  Enviromental effects also have their own set of calculations to be run.

Also when going from system to system you get into line attenuation, noise
limits, impedence matching, SWR, and EM interference.  All of these require
various modeling concepts of how currents move and interreact, to design for
and trouble shoot.  This is my day to day job.  Today it\'s motor controls
and line sycronisation.  Tomarrow it might be network communications
problems.  Welcome to the wide and varied world of controls and automation
design and maintainence.

True, very true, but by limiting you variables it greatly simplifies your
calculations.  You use one set for RF and another for IR and light.  This
greatly reduces formula complexity.  It also, unfortunately, get you to
thinking of them as very different things.

Very true.  A field that could phaze cancel instantaniously any frequency of
energy or convert it to one storable type of energy would in effect be a
black globe.  I do not want to even try to imagine the design problems in
the control and power systems in such a device.  Yuck!

True, I have done it and phaze canceled signals in the rf band as well but
only inside circuits (RF mixers, demodulaters, active filters, and SSBSC
systems) not in the air.  If a person does not know the theory behind it, it
is tough to grasp.

Also true, had not thought of that.  The other componet is molecular motion.
Your inverted phaze ir would cause more of that type of \'heat\' as it
canceled the IR.  You could end up with zero sum gain in total heat.  You
cure the desease but kill the patient.  I\'ve run into design problem like
this before.

Yes, good point.

Originally the Droyne didn\'t need coyns to caste (which is why I propose
that the Ancient coyn set had another function, ie. prediction, hunt magic
and the like). When the Droyne went into a decline after the Final War, they
gradually lost the ability to caste. Note that it took them 225,000 years
to reach that point. Then Grandfather decided to help them and seized on
the coyns as a convenient tool. He taught those Droyne communities that
he could find about using coyns as a sort of mental crutch. On about 20
worlds they learned and remained Droyne. On the rest they failed to learn
and turned into Chirpers (Well, you know what I mean).

There\'s no tech level so low that you can\'t have writing. All you need is
an implement and a medium. A small pointed stick and a slab of clay, for

Quite right, except that he tried introducing them to more than 20-odd
worlds. It just din\'t \'take\' on all of them (Vanejen is an example).
_Alien Realms_ has it that there are actually two kinds of chirpers: Those
that can\'t caste, even with the aid of coyns, and those (much rarer) that
can caste if they get taught how to use coyns. I don\'t think that idea was 
folllowed up on in later versions.

This has been discussed several times on the list. I won\'t go into details,
but it\'s extremely unlikely to be true. The likeliest version I\'ve seen is
that plagues significantly increased the proportions of Solomani to Vilani
on a few 1st Imperium worlds fairly close to Terra, and that the stories
from those few worlds, in the best tradition of urban legends, grew to
include the whole 2nd Imperium.

There were charts floating around the web someplace for fast minor race 
generation.  You don\'t *need* detailed information on them until the players 
get *stuck* there for a few months, and you can develope it organically as 
needed.

Point is, you *don\'t* have to have everything done at once.  All you need to 
do is work on the 3 or 4 worlds closest to your starting point.  The rest can 
be developed as needed, a few thoughts here, a few thoughts there.  And if 
you\'re not ready to have the players go there yet, distract them with a red 
herring, misjump them to someplace that *is* developed, whatever.

My take, based on what I\'ve read in the canon sources, suggests that the 
mainstream Droyne devolved from their previos capacities during the Final War. 
 A lot of the canon sources talks about genetically engineered viri attacking 
Droyne.  Some of these could be mutagenic as well.  Genetic drift over 300,000 
years could account for a bit of the rest.

Perhaps somewhere is a Droyne culture that *doesn\'t* need coyns to caste.  I\'m 
not sure about the ones on the planet next door to Grandfather\'s in his pocket 
universe.

It\'s not the low-tech worlds with exotic atmospheres that really bug me. As
you say, they could be aliens. And it\'s not the no-population garden worlds
either. It\'s the low-population garden worlds and the high-population
hell-holes. It\'s the fact that the population distribution is _exactly_ the
same for _all_ types of worlds.

If I told you that I rolled a 00 on my percentage dice in my latest RPG
session, I don\'t think you\'d find that unlikely enough to disbelieve me.
But if I told you that I rolled 50 \'00\'s in 100 rolls, you would propably
suspect that either my dice are crooked or I\'m lying. it\'s not any single
world, it\'s the accumulation of unlikely worlds that bothers me.

Yes, you can come up with explanations of most UWP combinations, but how
many _different_ explanations can you come up with?

That works for worlds with no population at all. Unfortunately most worlds
in traveller has _some_ population, showing that it is possible to survive
there.

That works for a limited number of planets inside large interstellar empires.
But what about garden worlds in neutral space? A planet with even fair
living conditions is a very valuable commodity. It takes someone immensely
rich (like the Emperor) to set aside such a resource for later generations.
  
And what\'s your take on near-empty garden worlds in Aslan space?

I had similar thoughts when I saw that detail in GURPS:Dinosaurs, but I
don\'t think so. The definition of thin to dense atmospheres means that
there is enough free oxygen present for a human to survive on it without
a compressor. There is some doubt that this was the case even 300 million
years ago (though GURPS:Dinosaurs does say that this is debated and that
anyone who wants their timetravelling humans to be able to breathe on
visits to the dawn of dinosaurs are free to assume that they can.

An atmosphere with too little oxygen to breathe would be exotic.

I\'m more interested in the corrolary: Any Traveller world with a thin to
dense atmosphere will have a fairly mature ecosphere.

My preferrence would be to compromise: Spend half an hour on each world
trying your damdest to come up with some explanation that didn\'t strain
credulity too much and hadn\'t been done to death (One example of this is
the \'recent nuclear war/meteor strike/deadly disease has reduced population
by a factor 1000\' explanation; it works once in a while, but it can get
really old real fast). If you can\'t, than throw a die against a number
you decide on beforehand based on just how odd the world UWP is; if you
make the roll, try again and come up with something; if not, make the
smallest chance that will make the UWP make sense.

Btw. sometimes it isn\'t the UWP in itself that is odd. sometimes it is the
UWP when contrasted with canonical history. For instance, the population
levels on Durendal and Hofud are way too low to fit with their history
(unless you use the nuclear war/etc. explanation).

That\'s not a definition that holds water, though. Think of all the worlds
with high tech levels and too few people to sustain such a technology. It
takes quite a few people to run an industrialized society. My preferred
definition is that TL is the level of technology in use by a majority of
the population. In many cases that would be the same as the production
capability, but not all. A mining camp would for example be the TL of 
the equipment they brought with them.

I almost agree. There is one good reason to stick with canon as long as
the canon makes sense: continuity and self-consistency. But if the canon
_dosen\'t_ make sense, or makes sense only at the cost of really stretching
the ol\' willing suspension of disbelief, then change it once and for all
and stick to that forthwith.

I agree. Programming will however always be about problem-solving 
therefor requiring the same skills but the method (language) you use to 
implement the solution is irrelevant (you can alway describe any concept 
in any language, human or computer).

The programmer that can solve the problem is a better programmer than
the one that knows a lot about computer language but can\'t see the 
solution.

Or has been terraformed.  Any world < size 5 (and some size 5) probably _has_

Except that it has a breathable atmosphere, which means a far more advanced
ecology.

And let me hasten to admit to a personal agenda here. Two years ago I wrote
an adventure set in the Sword Worlds in the year 71 for Imperium Games\'
adventure writing contest. Part of that adventure was set on a Dawnworld
much different from the one in BtC. The adventure went into a black hole,
but I still hope to get it published somewhere else. 

However, even without that I would still be of the opinion that a
breathable atmosphere requires a flourishing flora and fauna.

My take on this has been that all potential timelines are not created
equal: some differences are more significant than others.

When you woke up this morning, did your left foot strike the ground first,
or your right? Who can remember? Does it matter? My answer is "No". At the
moment that you stepped out of bed two timelines were created, but when
nothing further came of it the timelines remerged -- like virtual
particles, the timelines were created and destroyed too quickly to notice.

This assumes that a fair amount of minor sideslipping goes on all the time,
probably disguised as lapses of memory. You think you left your glasses on
the desk, but they turn up in your pocket anyway. Memory lapse, or slight
shift in timeline? with an equally puzzled "you" in another timeline
wondering how the glasses wound up on the desk instead of in his pocket.

Taken one step farther: the Illuminated Masters (for reasons unknown but
nefarious) have mined your bed last night. The "you" that stepped out on
the left foot is blown to smithereens (as intended), the "you" that stepped
out on the right foot misses the tripwire and gets to think, "Where did
that Claymore come from?" in time to look down and avoid immediate
disaster. Now there are two separate timelines, or will be until the
Illuminati catch up with you and finish the job. Like virtual particles
created at the event horizon of a black hole, one escapes and one is
destroyed.

You are left with an image of timelines like fractally fuzzy skeins of
yarn, interweaving, merging and diverging, until a significant event comes
to split the bundle into separate paths. Some of these separations merge
again farther down the line (as when the Illuminati "correct" your
continued existance), some continue indefinitely.

How about this instead - it is a fully functional \'demo\' of the legal
program.  This means that everything appears to work well, except that none
of the documentation it produces, or arguements it makes, is legally
admissable until the user fees are paid.

And it takes someone with a legal or admin of 1 or better to be able to
identify the clause that invalidates the documentation until the fees are
paid.  Forgery skill would allow the altering of the paperwork to allow them
to pass as legitimate.  Computer skill would allow for the bypassing of the
shareware routine entirely.

Speaking of computer skill - how do people feel about breaking the skill up
into hardware and software components?

I think that the list is there, but it is very inactive. I don\'t really

Why stop there ? Networks, AI, Analist, Programmer etc ...
How about splitting Engineering into Civil, Mech, or Elec ?
Medical into Pharmalogical, Surgary, GP, Consoltant, or Specialist ?

<abstracting (ie not directed at Douglas, but at all in general)>

Computer skill covers a large subject area, but then so do a lot of the skills
in traveller. If your group has computer specialities then IYTU it would
probably be good to split computing into further subsets, as this might
increase the enjoyment of Traveller. IYTU you might keep Medical as a all
encompassing skill, as the people in your group are not medics, but what of
the Traveller group who play at the local hospital, whould they split medical
into supsets, and keep Computer as one ?

IYTU YMMV.

</abstracting>

My pennies worth is, if it gives you more enjoyment to do it, go for it IYTU,
but to add it to the rules, no.

BtC is basically consistent with canonical maps of the Marches.  The discussion
has to do with First In, which uses somewhat plausible physics and thus results
in much of the spinward marches being implausible or impossible.  Of course,
this same discussion arose when BtC was being written (in that many worlds
there don\'t make a whole lot of sense) and none of the impossible worlds were
fixed at that time.

Sure. now, looking at _Shattered Ships_ (I know it\'s not the best
source), the auxiliary ships seem to have one less jump number than the
equivalent TL Battleship. So, for a TL15 fleet, to arrive with J-1 fuel
left in the tankers ties your fleet to J-2. That\'s a whole lot of
operational-level mobility that you just gave up.

Some other posters pointed out that the tankers could refuel themselves
and the other auxiliaries. How long does this take?

Cool. Where is the enemy fleet going to wait? The mainworld? Even
assuming that there\'s much of a fleet left after the deep meson
experience, I can take on fuel at the GG, and send for help after taking
out the enemy tankers, transports and his assault troops. 

Or the fleet could try and hold the Gas Giant. Fine. I\'ll fly back to
the mainworld, and send for reinforcements from there.

Or both? Hey, fine by me. If my enemy wants to ignore Lanchester\'s
equation and split his forces, I\'ll clean up.

As I am not currently a subscriber to Pyramid (still waiting for them 
to receive and process my check), I haven\'t had a chance to review 
the playtest for GT:FI.  I do have two major questions regarding 
First In, though:

1) Can I take a UWP from a canonical source and develop sensible 
extended system details from that (ala MTRef or LBB6)?

2) Can I take a UWP from a canonical source and develop world details 
from that (ala WBH)?  

If so, I can use it without problem, as I will not be violating the 
canonical universe (for those campaigns set in the OTU.)  If not, 
then I can use it for an unofficial TU, but I probably won\'t in my 
OTU-based campaigns.

My uninformed input:  I would prefer to have the ability to take a 
UWP from a canonical source and use First In to give it the world 
detail, based on the updated scientific information available today.  
It doesn\'t solve the perceived problems of the older star 
system/mainworld generation rules, but it also doesn\'t invalidate 20 
years of hard work.

Anything else it can do is icing on the cake.

Either way, I\'m looking forward to owning a copy, when it comes out.  
:)

Thanks,

Both you and him have points.  Not ones that are mutually exclusive IMO.   A
TL 8 world in the 57th century is probably only going to be barely
recognizable today, technology wise, and a TL16 one probably unimaginable (if
it\'s being done justice).  The TL of a world can\'t be the sum technical
knowledge... that would be ridiculous.  The top range of *that* would probably
be the highest commonly available in the vicinity. The independantly maximum
sustainable would seem to make the most sense.  There would have to be a
duration of some kind, too.  Maybe have the definition of tech level vary
according to population size?  Any Low-pop planet, it\'s the most commonly used
TL?  Higher than that, it\'s the maximum sustainable?  Low-pop planets cut off
from trade, supply, whatever will quickly fall to what they can sustain
(probably pretty low unless there\'s *some* kind of infrastructure).

Some universes might be more likely than others.  Even so, isn\'t this
preferable to paradoxes?  Unless, of course, u just forbid time travel (which
is kinda heavy handed IMO).  It hasn\'t happened yet (except forward) IMTU,
though i leave the possibility open in misjumps (though hasn\'t happened yet).

This is a nit, but strictly speaking, all of these are in the same "timeline."
Maybe "timeframe?"

Also, i\'d go w/ "NE" for "New Era," instead of VT, as Virus has largely
receded by the 1200s (at least as compared to 1130-1200), excepting possibly
the black curtain (though that\'s just speculation).  My old campaigns went for
almost 2 years and they only ran into Virus 6 or 7 times (and most of them in
the military campaign, excluding the Promise adventures), though i was
prepping for something big (the "society" on Larspri/Dethenes (0408/Old
Expanses).  I suspect my upcoming campaigns will be about the same, though
this time, i\'ll probably get to implement the adventures this time... heh heh.

YMMV.

    Don\'t take this offensively Ian, but being an atheist do you find that
the "Universe Cares" about anything? I\'m under the impression that you\'d see
it as non-sentient. In that case, the effect of two timelines could be a
part of it as much as a pebble changing the course of a river.
    I mean a river doesn\'t care whether there\'s a pebble in it either, but
that pebble can affect the entire universe. There have been a LOT of books
written on such subjects. Personally, I like the idea mentioned by the
previous poster though.

Later.

LOL.  That\'s a good analogy.  And funny, too. ; )

Traveller computers (especially those w/ organic computer cores, etc) are
probably completely unlike anything we\'re familiar with now, which would mean
the same thing for the software....

Again, I haven\'t seen GT:First In yet, but I do have a suggestion. 
I\'ve heard several people talking about the difficulties they have
with worlds designed under the old system, and wanting to pursue
converting them under the suggested GT:First In rules.  What does
this mean?  What kind of changes would this entail?

Discussion is good, but an example would be worth a lot more to me 
than certain old threads being rehashed.  Thus, I have a suggestion:  
Could someone who supports the idea of converting the older maps to 
the new system provide the list with an example subsector (or sector, 
if you feel adventurous) of either Spinward Marches or Solomani Rim, 
converted under the GT:First In rules?  This is, of course, assuming 
that such will not violate the playtest agreement.  If so, then when 
First In is released, would someone be willing to give this a shot?

Suggested conversion criteria:

1)  Try to keep as close to the original UWP stats as possible
without stepping outside the GT:First In system.  That way, if
something can exist under the GT:First In system, we don\'t have to
change that part of canon.  (More consistency with the previous 20 
years hard work.)

2)  If something within the UWP must be changed due to the new 
system (and that seems to be the gist of this thread), set an order 
of priority for preserving the original information.  I would suggest 
the following, in order from most important NOT to change, to least 
important:

a. System Presence
b. Physical Characteristics of mainworld
c. Physical Characteristics of the rest of the system
d. The Rest of the UWP

Short but simple.  More detail might be provided by others\' input on 
this criteria list.

With an example, it would be easier for me to see the impact the
suggestion of redoing the UWPs would have on the OTU.  After that, I
can give a much more informed opinion on this matter.  Until then,
this seems like the same old "flawed world generation" thread, 
disguised as a GT vs CT discussion.

Thoughts?  Ideas?  Suggestions?  Comments?

Thanks for listening to my simple request.  I appreciate your time, 
and I now return you to your normally scheduled thread, already in 
progress...

	So, how about the maximum sustainable TL is AVG(TL,(Pop UWP/2))?
So, your airless rockball TL15 minig station with 30 people on it, if "cut
off" (six months?) start dropping a TL every quarter until they hit TL8.
Which means amongst other things, that those snazzy TL 14 vaccsuits all be
came un-servicable two years before they bottomed out.

	Or is that not a big enough plunge?

The Kokirrak class dreadnaught is one of the more common classes of
capital ships in service in the Spinward Marches; a total of four
BatRons of this type serve on permanent station, with harbor
assignments at Rhylanor, Regina, Jewell and Mora.  Generally, one
squadron of Kokirraks is dispersed into independent ships with
ancillary escorts.  On patrol, the ships combine training operations
with routine patrols and reaction operations.

The Kokirrak is a preferred ship for flagship operations due to its
extensive admiral\'s quarters, which include command and communications
equipment, as well as entertainment chambers.  The ship is capable of
controlling a large fleet engagement within a system, as well as
holding its own in battle; the combination of fleet controller and
line-of-battle ship makes it an asset in any space combat situation.

Troops: Normally the Kokirraks do not carry troops. It is possible to
install modular quarters for up to 2000 troops (usually only 1000 are
carried) in the cargo hold.  A squadron of eight Kokirraks can carry
between 8000 and 16000 troops, or the equivalent of a reinforced
division.

Black Globe Generators: This class of dreadnaught, when originally
designed and constructed, mounted black globe force field generators.
Over the years, various ships have suffered black globe generator
failures, and the devices have not been replaced.  When encountered,
there is an approximately 50% chance that the ship will mount a
functioning black globe.

The Kokirraks are one of the older classes of dreadnaughts in Imperial
Service, and are now being phased out of service.  Within the last
decade (approx 1107) several ships have been disposed of to other
services such as the scouts, and to other governments, including
sector navies and client-states in the Spinward border regions of the
Imperium.

The Plankwell class dreadnaught is a more specialized ship than the
multi-task oriented Tigress class.  Lacking the extensive troop
complement and the large fighter screen, the Plankwell fulfills are
more traditional battleship role, as the centre of a fleet of
supporting ships.

For decades, the Imperial Fleet in the Spinward Marches has included
at least one BatRon of Plankwell class ships, but recently (1102), the
last squadron was rotated to the strategic reserve in Corridor Sector.
Sentiment in Naval and Sector circles runs high in favour of the return
of at least one BatRon to the Marches.

(Post 5FW addendum - The Plankwell dreadnaughts performed excellently
during the hostilities against the Zhodani invaders in the 5th Frontier
War, but sufferred from having to travel from Corridor in the early
days of the war. The Admiralty decided, after the war, to station
Plankwells along the borders, to provide a fast reacting force, and
allow time for the Battle Tenders and Riders to advance. The 101st
BatRon is an example of this policy.)

Plankwell class dreadnaughts are named for notable admirals in the
Imperial Navy.  The class name is taken from Grand Admiral Olav
hault-Plankwell, a sector admiral in the Spinward Marches who rose to
Grand Admiral of the Marches and lead defeat of the Outworld Coalition
during the 1st Frontier War (589 - 604).  Following his victory in 604,
he lead the fleet to the Core, personally dispatched the Empress
Jaqueline I, and took over the government.  The result was the long,
bloody Civil War; Olav was the first of the Emperors of the Flag.
Although Olav is in disrepute as an emperor, Grand Admiral Plankwell
is still remembered and honored for his achievements as a naval
commander in the First Frontier War; significantly, his name has not
been assigned to any ship in the new Cleon class of battleriders, named
for Emperors of the Imperium.

Modular Construction: Plankwell class dreadnaughts were built using a
modular design and construction technique which has proven cost-
effective in commercial ship-building.  A central strut or keel serves
as a foundation, bracing the drives and aligning the spinal mount,
while all other parts of the ship are mounted to brackets or
strengthened points along it.  The technique allows seperate
construction of the various modules (such as quarters, electronics
areas, fuel tankage, and control areas), with a final mating of all the
various components being performed only after the drives and keel have
been tested and accepted.  There was some initial concern that the
connecting points would be focusses for weaknesses in battle, but the
losses of two separate Plankwells in combat (prior to the 5FW) has been
attributed by investigating boards to strategic misdirection.

The Midu Agashaam class destroyer is a streamlined escort vessel
intended to supplement fleet defenses with anti-fighter and anti-small
craft ships. As yet (pre 1107) the class has achieved only limited
production, and is still considered to be experimental or developmental
in status.  The Admiralty, in its evaluation efforts, has thus far
deployed the ships in over-sized squadrons of ten to twenty vessels,
and has committed them to operations only with the Navy\'s major battle
fleets.

only published version of the game at the moment, and Marc Miller is getting
money from it (which one would assume he is via licensing) then it\'s "real
Traveller." It may not be "Canon" Traveller, but that\'s just fine by me. I
prefer the GT setting anyway (although I did enjoy the TNE and T4
settings..it\'s the rules I didn\'t care for).

It is a simple fact that in today\'s roleplaying game market, it is SETTINGS
that sell games, not rules. Numerous examples exist of games with arguably
weak systems (Deadlands and Shadowrun being two examples)that are popular
because their settings are so compelling. Traveller will sell IF the SETTING
is emphasized; which rules system is used is IRRELEVANT.

    'body' => '	I\'ve been thinking more about the question of a good
non-terracentric unit of interstellar distance measurement.  The problem
is this:  According to modern physics, C (light speed) is the only real
constant.  

	This means that you\'re stuck with either choosing an arbitrary
distance unit (such as the parsec) or choosing an arbitrary time unit and
multiplying by C to get, for example, the light-year, light-second, etc. 
The thing that gets me is that people in the Traveller universe would use
the parsec as a unit.  It\'s based on the earth\'s orbit, why would other
races use it?  One possibility is that they don\'t, and the maps we see are
simply made according to Imperial convention for player convenience (I
think there is a mention in S&A of Aslan males using a different unit
while females use the parsec to help smooth trade).  

	This may solve that problem, but then one is still stuck with the
mystery of why jump drives so conveniently work in units of whole parsecs. 
Is there some fundamental relationship between Earth\'s orbit and jump
physics?  Again, you can argue that jumps really don\'t happen in parsec
units, but then I\'d like to know what the unit actually is. Canon seems to
suggest that it\'s a discrete scale, that there cannot be Jump 0.5 drives,
for instance, so what\'s the actual unit if it\'s not really the parsec?

	One thing I\'ve been toying with is using cesium-133 vibrations as
the basis of an interstellar distance unit.  This is what some (most?) 
atomic clocks use.  What they do is take the integral of the oscillation
in the microwave spectral line of cesium-133, which amounts to a frequency
of 9,192,631,770 Hz. That provides a basic time unit of 1.0878x10^-10
seconds.  (Note that the use of Hz and seconds here is not important, any
units, Terran or not, will do).

	You then take C, 3x10^8 m/s and multiply by 1.0878x10^-10 s to get
roughly 3.26 centimeters as a base unit.  Let\'s call this a "Gleisse" 
after our favorite near-earth star observer. A useful unit for
interstellar distance measures would then be an ExaGleisse (exa is the
prefix for 10^18).  Okay, so it\'s going to need a better name :-), but
this conveniently comes out to roughly 3.4485 light-years.  You don\'t even
have to adjust your Traveller maps to use this, really.  One could simply
state that this is the unit of interstellar distance used and that in the
Imperium it\'s called a parsec for historical reasons.  

	This still leaves the mystery of why jumps happen in this sort of
unit (maybe SIDU, for Standard Interstellar Distance Unit would be a
better name?), but I find it slightly easier to handwave a link between
jump and atom vibrations than between jump and earth\'s orbit.  It\'s still
a little too convenient that jump works in a base-10 multiple of the
Gleisse, but that can be explained away by saying that the unit is
actually only close to an ExaGleisse/SIDU and that .0326*10^18 is just a
common rounded value that\'s used (the same way we use 3*10^8 for C).  Of
course, you can do the same with a parsec, but it still seems funny to me
that it would be so close to a paralax unit based on earth\'s orbit. 

	Note that some Terran units are used in calculating the above, but
this is not important.  The speed of light is a constant, no matter what
units you use, as is the cesium vibration time.  Multiply one by the other
and you get a constant distance.

	The only Terran bias here is using a base-10 multiple of the
fundamental unit, which I suppose the Aslan would dislike (they could get
pretty close with 8^20 units), but most of the other races should be okay
with it.  If they had to agree on a universal distance unit, I think the
the Zhodani, K\'Kree, etc would certainly find this easier to swallow than
some unit based on the orbit of Terra!  And of course if it is the basic
unit of jump distance, then they would all use it by convention anyway...

	Okay, I\'ve babbled on about this enough, but I just want to finish
by saying that I\'m not proposing any changes to the OTU or anything (that
would be heretical!), just trying to work out a good standard unit for use
IMTU. 

Thoughts?

You are arguing for incompetant naval procurement IMO.

It isnt that hard to build jump-4 tankers and freighters at TL13, which
will let them keep up with a jump-4 TL15 fleet.

Now, having jump-4+1 tankers is going to reduce your payload substantially
over jump-4 tankers, but this is why collapsible fuel tanks were invented.

Assuming no-one is shooting at you, about as long as normal refuelling, I
guess.

What about the natural logarithm base e (2.7182818...)? Or pi? I wonder
if these are universal constants.

According to CT Book 6, Earth\'s orbit is not unique. Earth\'s orbit is
just one of the standard distances that planets may be found at. That
is, there will be other systems where a planet has an orbit roughly 150
million kilometers from its sun.

So, it isn\'t that Earth-centric after all.

That looks pretty good to me.  Maybe put the Pop multiplier in there
somewhere, but maybe not.  Could do something even simpler and say UWP pop
digit months or something, then TL goes down 1 or whatever, etc.  It\'d be easy
to make that a general assumption, exceptions at the Ref\'s desire, of course
:-).  I\'m thinking the "basics" (like life support on a normally uninhabitable
world).   

For something as particular as a vacc suit, or another specific equipment
item, i think you need something like wear values.  When the trade/supplies
run out, it should get harder to do PM (for MTU, I go more towards the written
rules when this happens (as opposed to simply the number mp/week, w/ no rolls
to properly maintain, which is for normal circumstances)).

I wasn\'t suggesting that you fit this system to a standard BatRon or CruRon.
You\'re right, normal equipment would be insuffient to create an illusiory
radar image. I was thinking more along the lines of an elite BatRon with
support vessels. They could be called upon to defend systems in trouble, or
draw out shipping lane pirates or something. They would cost an inordinate
amount of money, but unless they get themselves into the middle of a Zhodani
fleet or something equally as deadly the enemy aren\'t going to be around long
enough to shoot back.

Another aspect of the technology is on a much smaller scale. Create a deep-
space mine, containing a Friend-or-Foe nuke warhead and some small cannon. The
radar spoofer would be used to make it look like an asteroid, or a damaged
fighter or abandoned tug. If the stealth system on board is transmitting false
radar returns then they could be used to piggy-back a scanning beam of it\'s
own. If it came across something it didn\'t like, it fired and zipped away on a
one-shot booster rocket. Lay a few around a system and you\'ve got a disguised
Planetary Defense System and a \'tripwire\' for incoming fleets.

This is a fairly silly argument. The reality is that when you roll a die
trillions of universes exist - one for every interaction of every atom in 
the die, or more. Most of those universes have it coming up with the loaded
side up.

(So probabilities are maintained, at the cost of many nearly-indistinguishable
universes.)

The only thing that I find that really puts GURPS Trav outside of "real"

systems there is pretty good consistency and "mutual intelligblity" which
isn\'t true of GURPS,  maybe after I\'ve had the GURPS stuff longer I\'ll make

Actually, I think comparisons like the above are pointless (IMHO). Sure, you\'ve got the 
flavor of the month, which, as Ethan has stated, is currently patterns and distributed 
systems. But that doesn\'t invalidate _any_ of the previously used methods of 
programming, any more than OO invalidated procedural. While every magazine out there 
may be screaming "Patterns! UML! Distributed! Internet! Java!", the majority of 
professional programmers, in my experience, ignore the flashy headlines and simply use 
what works best for them. A programmer that\'s been coding in COBOL for over 15 years is 
more productive and powerful than a programmer that\'s been doing UML and Java for only 
1 year. 

I use a mixture of techniques myself. Professionally, I use C++. I do some modeling in 
UML. I write intranet front ends in Java. I\'ve written some business logic in Prolog. I 
tweak my code in assembly. I use patterns, polymorphism, inheritence, encapsulation, 
etc...frequently, but not all the time.

I expect it\'ll be this way for some time to come.

Your milage may vary...

I have to agree that it was a good dig.  But, the point
I was trying to make was about computer programming and
the expertise behind it.  The VB of Traveller may be a
natural language interface that anyone with a little
training can use.  It\'s very flexible and forgiving, but
it\'s a CPU hog and does not necessarily create the best
code possible.

  "Computer, assemble a virus that will sift through
   the Imperial datacore and remove all references to
   the Lady Jane.  Use modules, Loki and Norn."

  "Warning, Norn has been compromised and a defense may
   exist within the target system."

  "Noted.  This is a backwater scout base, continue."

  "Program assembled.  Would you like to add a taunt?"

On the other hand, a programmer with a higher skill
level would whip out the goggles.  (Holodisplays are
nice, but goggles offer privacy and better 3D sound.)
Our hacker grabs the modules that he needs and notices
that module Norn has a warning glow/tone painted on it.
With a few tweaks to the signature block and some new
spoofing code, the computer assigns a safer color.

  "Bind the modules under Revenge1 and check against
   known scanning software."

  "Revenge1 has raised no exceptions."

  "Transmit to the local communications hub."

  "Acknowledged."

The diea is not to make youself invisible, but innocuous. Even if a million
wavecrests bounce back, on 1Ghz radar that lasts 1000th of a second. It\'ll

Your logic shows that my (and Larry Niven\'s) example is not a good one.
The point that I was trying to make is that the parallel universe
concept, as detailed in the post to which I replied, implies that all
possible outcomes for a given _single_ event are equally probable.

Your comment showed that my example is not a single event, it is a
complex series of motions involving trillions of "sub-events", each of
which has a different outcome.

The flaw lies in the example, not in the logic. A good example must be a
single event that has multiple outcomes, but where at least one outcome
is more likely than the others.

Finding any one such example disproves the parallelism theory. I suspect
than these examples will all have to be of a subatomic particle nature,
and I don\'t have the physics background to come up with them.

I throw it out to the list: does anyone have an example of a
multiple-outcome event, with at least one outcome more likely than
others, where the event is not composed of smaller events?

>Thoughts?

With all due respect, I think you are thinking about this too hard. :-)

The parsec is a measure of convenience to make things simple for players
(as you said). Jump does not have to be, in truth, directly tied to parsecs
or whole units in general. Instead, one can say that it\'s tied to something
close to a parsec and that astrogators of the 3rd Imperium say "parsec"
because it\'s a Galanglic word (since that language is largely derived from
English, IIRC). For all we know, the actual value of Jump-1 could be 3.26
lightyears, 4,322 miles, 634 feet and 2.335 inches.

Mainworlds would not be exactly 1, 2, 4 or 6 parsecs away from each other
in the real universe, and jump numbers are abstractions that recognize
this. There would probably be units like Vilani "mashuggammas" and Aslan
"ohweeohweeohs" and Vargr "rrrghas" that are similar in distance to
parsecs, and are similarly abstracted to measure jump distances.

It\'s like saying "yards" or "paces" or "meters" interchangeably for games
- -- it isn\'t exact by a long shot, but it gets across the idea.

Which GDW supplement on the Marches?

CT Supplement 3 which is just a collection of maps, UWPs and a paragraph or

CT The Spinward Marches Campaign - which looks at the SM after the FFW...
Lots of background and military stuff.

seems like you\'re spending a lot of time on this, and I don\'t personally
think it\'s worth it. Most people and societies don\'t get too exact about
a lot of things, like our calendar for instance.

did you know that it\'s very likely Jesus was born in 4 B.C.? 
Why don\'t we, with all our computers and Cesium clocks, come up with a
way to make our planetary 23.59xxx daily cycle better match up with our
annual cycle? 
Why do English-speakers still use feet and inches? 
Why to the British and their former colonies drive on the left side of
the road while everyone on the European continent and in the US drive on
the right?
Even the metric system is Terra-centric, as you put it.

NONE of these things "make sense" from a purely cosmological point of
view (except arguably, the inability to match up the daily and annual
calendrical cycles--one of God\'s grander jokes, IMO). but people being
people, once we\'ve decided to stick with a system, no matter WHAT it
derived from originally, they\'re apt to stick with it until forced to,
or until it no longer does the trick.

So I suggest you pick a standard, give your players a reason they can\'t
disprove (the diameter of a Vargle atom, for instance), and go from
there. I think your players will thank you for it.

Unfortunately there are probably boring answers too.  Anything with decent
small craft facilities can become a tender/mobile scout base.  Given the
Scouts\' duty to go in harms way, a little muscle probably can save lives. 
Maybe local despots are less likely to mess with first contact teams if the

As a math student I have no objection what so ever to the 
possibility of a infinite number of parallel universes where
new universes are created by every change in state of every
existing quark. This should result in that every possible
universe exists in the same way that every real number exist 
(meaning you don\'t have to write it before it exists).

With this handwawe you don\'t get any paradoxes, but is could get 
really tricky to travel backward accurately (finding the desired paths). 
You will get a _really_ infinite number of universes.

In my game however I allow time-travel forwards in time and 
the possibility to "look" back in time. If you look forwards 
in time your vision will only be a potential one. The mechanics of 
time-travel forwards in time are not understood but some scientist/
philosophers have some crazy ideas that "just might work"... :) 

Not that timetravel/psionics is a regular feature IMTU, but it\'s 
always good to be prepared.

        Hi, Joesph....
        In fact when I mapped out the area around Earth for my TNEC game, I
discovered the only two planets even close to being a parsec distant of each
other are Earth and Alpha Centari =).  So, I just said that "jump 1" is
3.3ly or less (including micro-jumps) and "Jump -2" was 3.31ly to 6.6ly,
etc.  It works well enough;  my map doesn\'t have hexes on it.

Pi will look a bit different if you use a base for numbers other than
10. It will however still be the same number as pi is defined by 
geometry and the fact that our universe is a .. where did I put 
the d-mn book... yes here it is .. metric space (metric not as SI-units 
but as in possible to measure distance).

IIRC one second is nowadays redefined to be a (whole) number of 
oscillations of cesium (-133?) thereby actually changing the length
of the second. This could, as someone pointed out earlier, be used with 
c to define a universal length (to tedious IMHO to use in a game).

But when you\'re talking about phase cancelling you *have* to be using
a wave model ... which is where part of the original thread started.
And I suspect when you start talking about things like doppler
effects, phase distortion, delay lines, and various advanced ECM
effects you\'ll have to use both.

	I\'ve got some doubts about the half wavelength thing there ... since
the current flow in the electronic circuit is *less* than lightspeed,
for the delay from input to output to be that short, the *entire*
process including power etc. would have to occur in less than
half-wavelength\'s work of circuitry--at millimeter wave radar you\'re
talking quite short stuff. Yeah, I know IC\'s are small and getting
smaller, but I suspect it\'s a fairly complex circuit, especially if
it\'s putting out useful amounts of RF.

	And I also suspect that half a wavelength of return signal (before
it gets phase-cancelled) would still set off sensors, especially if
this technology were to be developed. "Gee Cap\'n, I got a partial
blip and then it just disappeared! Aw, shucks, system must be on the
fritz ..." might happen the first few times this device were used,
but the bright guys in ECCM would soon figure it out.

	Now throw in a "hopping" radar, changing frequencies according to
some pseudorandom sequence. If the sensor computer gets a
half-wavelength return each time it hops, that oughta set bells
ringing.

	No, I was discussing the implied "nominal" case of normal
spacecraft, which I understand to be something like what your average

so we all know what we\'re discussing, but the general case has more
applicability.

	But if this kind of ECM is practically developed, it\'ll only be
useful until the other side finds out it exists. Then they\'ll be on
the lookout for brief "blips" that disappear.

	Throw in frequency/amplitude/phase hopping, and the continuous
stream of disappearing blips, in the same place, and right at hop
transition, and even Elmer Fudd will start looking suspicious.

As I understand it, they managed to do the calculations for an
*individual* hydrogen atom back in the late 50s/early 60s. They did the
ones for a hydrogen *molecule* rather recently. As the atom gets more
complex *and* as you add atoms, things get *really* complex. 

We\'re talking *centuries* of computer time.

Neither did mine, other than the "check the properties of the earlier

All elements have a "crystaline" form. But that doesn\'t mean what you
may think it does. Metal crystals look just like the metal normally
does, except for the facets.

It\'s going to be a metal. Thus a conductor. And I think such multiple
covalent bonds will be pretty weak.

Not likely. But propeties that *are* likely are very high or very low
melting points (If you check the periodic table, you\'ll see that for a
number of the "periods" the melting point goes *down* as the atomic
number goes up, and vice versa).

For example, look at group 1A (LI, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Fr). The melting
points drop steadily as the elements get heavier. Yet in group VIII
(Fe,Co,Ni;Ru,Rh,Pd;Os,Ir,Pt) they get *higher*.

Another is that superheavy elements ought to have *very* loosely bound
electrons in the outer shells, which means they\'d be likely to be
kicked loose by *low* frequency EM. Red light, Infrared, maybe even
microwaves or *radio*.

So the stuff could, under the right circumstances, develop a huge
charge from something like a radar beam sweeping across it. And if the
players ship gets too close before the charge gets neutralized by the
stellar wind..... ZAP!

Lord only knows. But at least that is the sort of thing where a player
can\'t just jump up and point out that "It can\'t work that way!". 

Here\'s a good thought. We know that Barium works as a jump grid. But
Lanthanum is better. Since Cerium is *not* better (or it\'d be being
used) it\'s obviously a "nuclear" property, not a "chemical" (ie
electron cloud) one, because Barium and Lanthanum are in *different*
groups in the periodic table. 

If it was a matter of groups, then you\'d expect Yttrium to be the
"works, but poorly" element. Still, it could be that *heavier* elements
in the same groups as Barium and Lathanum will work. The next heavier
than Barium is Radium. And the next than lathanum is actinium. Both are
far too expensive *and* far too radioactive to use. 

But let\'s assume that someone did some sort of tests with *small*
amounts. Just enough that they thought there might be better
performance. Thus they speculated that #121 (eka-lathanum) would be
better, and #171 (dvi-lathanum) would be *really* good. The next in the
series would be #221 (twi-lathanum).

The eka-, dvi, etc prefixes are semi-standard for describing elements
note yet discovered, but that are the "next" in a group. They are
Sanskrit? for "one", "two", etc.

Now the players have access to this deposit that contains #171 (I\'m
assuming that 121 isn\'t far enough into the island of stability)

> What if it took Jumpium 139 instead and the characters had only found
> Jumpium 137?  What would be necessary to turn it into it isotopic form?

About the same thing that\'s necessary to turn lead into gold. A *lot*
of massive, expensive equipment. Remember, isotopes are *different*
atoms with the *same* number of protons. Thus their *chemical*
properties are the same. The differing numbers of neutrons will make
their *nuclear* properties different.

Also, those varying numbers of neutrons make *huge* differences in the
stability of the atom. 

BTW, the atomic *weights* involved are likely to be in the 300-500 range.

More likely it\'d go *boom*. Or just decay into a bunch of useless
stuff. You can\'t *make* heavier elements in "normal" accelerators any
more. They don\'t stay together long enough. These days they are using
"heavy ion" accelerators. So rather than slamming small atoms or
particles into heavy atoms, they are slaming medium weight atoms into
each other. 

I expect nuclear damper tech will be involved in the Imperial equivalent.

But I expect that your players will have enough fun with the
"Jumpium". Consider that even if it is the "right isotope" (almost
certain as the others would be *far* too unstable to use), they have to
*purify* it, because it\'s likely to be a mix of *dozens* of other
superheavy elements. All with *almost* identical *chemical* properties
(check into what it takes to seperate the "rare earth" elements from
each other)

Then, once they have the stuff in pure form, they have to *machine* it.
Check out the problems with machining things like Uranium and
Plutonium. They have a several different allotropes (ie several
different crustal forms with differing properties). Allotropes can have
*really* different properties (like graphite and diamond) or just
*slightly* different. The problem is that in these heavy metals the
crystal form will change *several* times as the temperature changes
thru the normal range of "machining" temperatures. 

This means that the *dimensions* of a chunk of the metal will change
noticeably as the temp changes, and worse, the *ratio* between them
changes. In other words, it may get longer, but narrower. Or some other
such combination. 

This can drive machinists *nuts*. It\'s not so bad once you have the
behavior *documented*. But these guys are going to be *discovering* the
properties. :-)

Oh yes, the "dust" from machining is *guaranteed* to be both *highly*
toxic (it *is* a "heavy metal" after all), but also highly *flammable*.
The stuff is apt to catch fire while being machined if you aren\'t
careful. 

Still, if they persevere, they\'ll have a jump grid of dvi-lanthanum
(aka "Jumpium" :-). 

Now comes the fun part. They get to re-calibrate the drive for the new
grid, and they have to *conceal* their find. 

ps. I doubt the deposit would be big enough for more than a *very* few
ships, unless you *really* want to screw up the universe. Besides, it\'s
more fun if the players *can\'t* just give some jumpium to <whoever> to
make them quit trying to grab their ship. :-)

I suspect that it also helped that they\'d be less susceptible to

There\'s *very* little mixing between the northern and southern
hemispheres. What there is consists mostly of some areas near the
equator being in the northern weather patterns part of the year, and
the southern patterns at other parts of the year. 

Air circulation tends to be in bands parallel to the equator. On earth
there are two or three (I forget) bands in each hemisphere. The equator
is pretty much a "calm" zone.

Also, keep in mind that if there\'s only an oxygen atmosphere (of sorts)
during the summer, that means that during "spring" and "fall" there 
*isn\'t* one. So your civilization *can\'t* follow the oxygen, as there\'s
no oxygen in *either* hemisphere for six months (two seperate three
month periods). 

At *some* point, you\'d get to the point where it was *only* the winter
when the O2 content was gone (or too low). But that\'d be fairly late in
the game, and by then I think it\'d be only a short time until you hit
the year round point.

If one could then polarize the response, and incorporated this substance

James Bond 007 had an excellent setting and I rather liked the rules system,

not very realistic.  Very difficult to figure out ground covered in a

**looking up the KOKIRRAK-class in Supplement 9**

Well...

With Jump-4, 6-G performance, KOKIRRAKs have good legs.  Plenty of
computer power, for analysis of survey data.  I suspect that the T4 and
G:T translations of the design have sensors from here to eternity.  If
the IISS gets a KOKIRRAK with a black globe generator, they have a truly
stealthy platform from which to deploy remote sensors for long-term
survey of an inhabited, medium-to-high tech planet.

Besides, they don\'t come out of the IISS ship construction budget....

How about the amount of time it takes light to move a certain percentage of
the Galactic Radius. That\'s fairly universal.

Using 2 unique stars would work in place of the galactic radius, but this
could end up again being unique to the race that controls those stars

        A friend of mine, who is an avid reader of the books, tells me this:
The reference is to *how* Hyperspace travel is managed.  The issue is
picking the tighest trajectory while screaming across the cosmos without
"bouncing too close to a super nova", et al.  The Falcon has *military*
quality computers which have been tweaked all to hell...  it was able to
grind the course distance required for the Kessel run, including object
avoidance, to a mere 3 parsecs....  almost the actual distance.  The closest
anyone else ever came was *5*.  Which meant the Falcon was covering the same
distance in *much* less time.

You sound like M.A.R. Barker of Teklemel...I once read somewere that he said
that the story telling was the important part, and the mechanics of a RPG was
an afterthought....(or something like that as I\'m trying to rerember a 15 yr.
old article). I agree with you, but I wouldn\'t go as far as saying irrelevant.
The exact "bells and whistles" are not important, but it is important that the
rules:

1) work
2) be simple (I know that a lot of people like complicated rules (like me),
but I feel that simple Star Wars style rules bring in the new blood/rug rats.
Perhaps T5 should have a "kiddie" module of starter rules?
3) be consistent
4) be edited for loopholes. I hate "rules weasels".

Not in Traveller terms. A tainted thin to dense atmosphere is by definition
breathable with nothing more than a filter mask. If you need supplementary
oxygen tanks it\'s exotic.

Upon consideration I guess that a low-oxygen atmosphere with slightly less
than enough oxygen (but enough so that you can breathe with a compressor
mask) is closer to the definition of a tainted atmosphere than to the
definition of an exotic atmosphere, but such an atmosphere would have to
have quite a lot of oxygen to qualify. Once you need supplementary oxygen
tanks or backpack-sized compressors, it\'s exotic.

It is my opinion that the Ancients should be used as sparingly as possible.

Nope. Radio waves are electromagnetic *field* effects. The electrons

No. Light is generated when the electrons at the inner levels have been
raised to a higher level and then fall back to their "ground state".
When they fall back, they emit the difference between the old and new
"orbital" as a quantum of electromagnetic radiation (aka a photon).

I think he\'s talking about the *bandwidth*, more than the frequency.
Also, just because *we* use the gigahertz bands for uplinks doesn\'t
mean that the Imperium does.

Don\'t forget that you have sources of heat that are *not* part of the
ship\'s power systems. For example, every person on board is producing
heat at 100 or more watts. And the sunlight at 1 AU from a G type star
is around a kilowatt per square meter. Figure the maximum dimension of
the ship, add a bit, then figure that the cross sectional area of the
globe is that of a circle that many meters in diameter. 

For example, a ship 50 meters long with a crew of 30 is going to be
dealing with:

People: 30 * 100 = 3 kW
sunlight: (50/2)^2 * pi ~= 1963  call it 2 MW

So you are getting extra energy at the rate of 2003 kiloJoules/sec. Or
~120 MJ/min, or 7.21 GJ/hr, or 173 GJ/day, or 1.21 TJ/week. 

You\'ll go "boom" soon enough.

Actually, commsats *will* eventually go to the "manned" version, at
least for the ones in geosynch.

There\'s a limited number of "slots" in orbit available, and it makes
sense to have more channels per satellite rather than lots of
satellites. So eventually, we\'ll wind up with soewhere between 3 and 6
*big* commsats with onboard techs doing regular maintenance and the
like.

Rather like a telephone exchange. They *can* be fully automated and
somewhat "disposable, but it\'s actually cheaper to have them have
*some* people on duty handling "special" jobs, and doing maintenance.

So I\'d expect that by TL10 or so, they\'d be installations of 100 or
more tons, with *lots* of antennas (as you want seperate antennas at
seperate frequencies for a lot of things). The interior will have some
"operator" positions, as well as some tech monitoring ones. The rest
will be rack after rack of electronics, with enough room between them
for easy access for repairs and for replacement/upgrading.

They\'d *probably* use solar power plus batteries (you need batteries
because even at geo-synch orbit, you wind up in the dark for as much as
an hour part of the year). But they might have a small fusion plant.

>  Same thing with a GPS or a weathersat.

GPS is supposed to be in low orbit, and in fact would be degraded by
having people moving around. Weathersats depend. So may be low orbit.
But a lot are geosynch, and it\'d be cheaper to add the required gear to
the big commsats. That allows for regular maintenance, and "tuneups",
It also makes them easier to upgrade. 

The one "disadvantage" of manned satellites at geosynch orbit is that
they need "storm cellars" in case of flares. Still, those flares are
*also* the most likely thing to cause things to break. 

Does anyone have info on how well the various hull materials act as
radiation sheilding? If so, post it. I\'ll have to try doing some rough
plans. 

> About the only thing you\'d need plans  for would be a weapons
> platform or a defense platform.

Actually, those are *less* likely to be manned. Considere that once
space travel gets easy, they are apt to be *easy* targets unless
*heavily* armored. 

Anything in a fixed orbit will be *toast* until the point where
asteroid hulls become practical. So orbiting weapons platforms will
either be "disposable" or *BIG*.

Here\'s another fun thought.  Maybe the reason that various jump performances are
linked to tech level stems from the discoveries of better and better jump
catalysts.  So, while jump might be discovered with Barium, later experimentation
around TL 12 produces the much better Lanthanum drive (Jump 2) and as Fusion tech
increases, they are able to create better and better catalysts.  This can be
written off canonically as the "standard" drive (TL 12 jump 2) uses Lanthanum, and
thus is the only element refered to often.

the ammo is differentiated for sub or hyper sonic mode, because the flight

good hypersonic shapes tend to be innefficient sub-sonic shapes and

1945    A expedition is mounted from Agidda to investigate the source of the
transmission.
1946    The expedition come back with a report of a world that is capable of
exploiting nuclear engery and has over two billion humans. In addition
several of the system moons and planetoids are rich in minerals.
1947    The second followup expedition is sent to inventory the system. It
is suddenly withdrawn when a shuttle mishap cause a shuttle to crashland in
a desert in the northern region in the smaller continent (One of two

2000    First Contact.
- ----

So what would be the Vilani first contact and intregration plan for Earth?

I have some vague ideas on how this timeline would proceed but here is a
rough outline.

Terra is intregrated into the Ziru Sirka.
The increased contact with Terra triggers the Plague of Duskar.
The Plague of Duskir become widespread due to the long process for Vilani
approval of Terran medical practices.
The Terrans medical practices are approved and are implemented thourghout
the Ziru Sirka. Terra is granted many biotechnology patents. Many Terrans
are permitted to form or join the Medical castes.
Many Terrans who don\'t like the Vilani acquire jump ships and escape beyond
the frontier forming outland colonies.
The Ziru Sirka stabilizes briefly as the Duskar Plague is brought under
control. But the Vargr makes increasing inroads.
A hundred year time of peace the Outland colonies continue to spread and
mature.
Various Outland colonies begin to raid the rimward frontier. This escalates
into the Outland Wars.
The Outlands can\'t descively defeat the Vilani but there are too many
Outland colonies for the Vilani to eradicate. The Outlanders form a loose
Outland Alliance
The Outland ship Pathfinder crashlands on Kusyu. The surviving Outlands help
the Aslan build their first jump ship and return home to the Outlands.
The numbers of the Aslans and the technological knowhow of the Outlands
prove to a formidable alliance against the Vilani. After a hundred years of
wars the Ziru Sirka collapses.
The Ziru Sirka is divided into four broad regions. The Vargr controlled
sectors of Vland, Lishun, Antares, Gushemege, Dagudashag,Core, Fornost
The Borderlands of Ilesh, Zarushagar, Masillaa, Delphi.
The Outland-Aslan worlds of Daibei, Magaar, Reaver\'s Deep, Dark Nebula, and
parts of Zarushagr Masillaa, Diaspora, and Solomani Rim.
The Terran worlds of Diaspora, Solomani Rim, Alpha Crucis, and Old Expanse.

When the Aslan-Outlands forces broke through in Diaspora. The Governor at
Terra consilidated control over the Rimward-Trailing Provinces. He used
Terran inventness to combat the Aslan-Outland alliance to a standsill. Then
over a period of twenty years he brought in a many worlds of the old Ziru
Sirka as he could announced the formation of the new Ziru Sirkaa with the
capital at Dingir

Interestingly enough, I just completed a 10K Scout Far 
Cruiser/Mobile Command Base for a group of characters IMU.  

Their Mission: to bring the Sidurii Cluster into the Imperium.

The major purpose of the _Far See_ class is to show just how 
powerful the new Imperium is.  

"My God! They put Jump 3 engines in that monster!"  

"Yeah, and there are a couple more just a few months away."

It also has some teeth, though, along with an assortment of other 
destroyers, Kon Tiki class ships, etc.

Dang.  And to think I had an original idea, too.  Then to have it out

This race is, for lack of a better term, extremely resistant to radiation.
What kind of biological processes would endow a race with such resistance?

An exoskeleton with "shielding" in it? This might work, but physical

Sorry, but IR<>Heat. Hot objects emit IR, but IR is *not* heat.
Canceling IR will *not* cool something. 

And even if we had "photonic" circuitry equivalent to the radar stuff
you are talking about, it wouldn\'t give invisibility. That\'s because at
IR and optical wavelengths one is usualling using *imaging* sensors.
The object being detected covers *huge* numbers of pixels. It\'s
thousands or *millions* of wavelengths in size. Which means that you
can\'t use simple phase cancelation anymore. Or, rather, you have to use
tricks that cancel or redirect ligt coming from *all* directions. 

Oh yeah, "invisibility" requires being effectively *transparent* to the
radiation. It hasn\'t been achieved even with radar. What radar stealth
has managed is near 100% non-reflectivity. In space, there\'s little
difference. Even at radar wavelengths it can be a critical difference.
For example, a good "look down" radar would notice that there\'s an area
where it *isn\'t* getting a ground return. And the smaller the
wavelength, the more noticeable this sort of thing is.

True, you *can* hide things that way. In fact, a sufficiently large
"balloon" will get your emmissions per sq. meter down to something
non-suspicious.

At a given frequency, a photon is the smallest unit of energy. At a
longer wavelength, the photons have less energy. At a shorter one, they
have more energy.

The relationship is given by Heisenberg\'s equation:

E = h f
E = energy of photon
h = Planck\'s constant
f = frequency of photon

Keep in mind that there is almost certainly *some* frame of reference

Well, the first "rule" has to be that it can\'t break any rules we\'ve
*already* got. Which is how physicists have managed to work out
"possible" time machines. 

The basic difference between "local" and "global" causality violations
is that "local" allows effects to apparently preceed causes, while
global could have effects that don\'t *have* causes.

Only if you allow the past to be changed. If it is fixed, then anything
he does would have already been done. And thus be part of his past.

In fact, theoretical studies of particle interactions via a "wormhole"
type time gate show that interactions between the past and future
particles *have* to be such that the past is conserved.

Later studies showed problems that prevent such wormholes from being
created, but the idea still stands. 

Try to use a time machine to shoot the inventor and your gun *will*
jam. If you persist, you may get struck by lighning. Or worse...

Huh? How do you get a average temp of 65.7 from a max of 212.4 and a

Alas, I don\'t have a CRC handbook handy. If I did, I\'d be able to look

Optical fibers *are* waveguides. Just for much, much smaller

Nope. Radar is *photonic*. And light is electromagnetic waves. It\'s
just that at *those* wavelengths, the particle/wave duality falls out
differently. 

Radar waves do not have charges either. They have oscillating
electrical and magnetic fields. Phase canceling just places opposite
phases of the wave against each other, giving equal but opposite field
strengths.

You *can* do the same with light. Ever see an optoical interference
pattern? Same thing. Phases cancelling and reinforcing.

So does the speed of other EM radiation.

Sorry, but unless you can overthrow the laws of thermodynamics, *all*
of the powerplant output winds up as heat sooner or later. Stuff like
radio and radar signals (and laser beams) are in the "later" class.
Even then, a good chunk of the power to generate them winds up as heat.

 It is based on M.K. Wren\'s Phoenix Legacy Trilogy (Sword of the Lamb,

My questions are simple:  What would the Tech Level be for the Solar System
and Castor and Pollux?

What is the Government Type for these worlds?

My thoughts on tech level would be at most high 9 or low 10.  As to the
government type, I was thinking of either a Fuedal Technocracy or perhaps a

About as good as the specialist mages in AD&D - nice idea, but a generalist
is more usable because they are more flexible.

As I have said before on this list, it gets back to skill coverage. Have
too many skills and specialities, and you are not going to be able to cover
everything with a typical adventuring group. Too few and it becomes too
unrealistic or boring. That\'s why you add things such as Cascade, Cluster,
and Included skill sets. For Medical, have the person specialise in one
area but be able to do the other things at a reduced level of skill (the
specific mechanism will depend on which version of Trav you are using. ;-).

Here\'s a compromise suggestion: add some sort of Cascade/Cluster idea as an
optional rule in T5, with an example of how a skill is diversified.

substance hits the rotating impeller.  Conceptually I\'ve also got larger
caliber (read more effective) gauss rifles / pistols floating around in my
head, but I haven\'t done any FF&Sv2 work on it yet since I hate long math :)
Isn\'t there a design spreadsheet out there like Andy Akins\' excellent
starship sheet that I use for those of us that hate math?  Two of my
favorites; a 10mm version similar to the rifle shown on my site, and a 20mm
sniper\'s version capable of really "reaching out and touching someone" or
switching over to sub sonic for silently taking out a target at a shorter
tactical range.  Maybe I\'ll work those up when I post my "real" Traveller
site.

No, it isn\'t really.  You have one world that has been Imperial since the
Spinward Marches was originally published, and now has never been Imperial
in BTC (1727).  23 Naval and Scout bases have disappeared.  One world
(0301) all of a sudden gained a 1000 fold increase in pop to become a High
Pop world (capitalized on maps), and 5 worlds (0416, 0627, 1011, 1102,
3025) lost their High pop rating (no longer capitalized on the maps).
X-boat routes have dissapeared (2326 - 2228 - 2231, and 2712 - 2510 -
2410).  Starports have changed without any reason (0607 went from an E(I)
to a X(0), and 2735 went from a D(II) to a B(IV)).

These are only the changes that have no reason listed in the world
description and that change older Traveller Maps.  This does not include
obvious errata in BTC, such as where the description says one thing, but
the stats omit it (such as Andor (0236) not listed as a Red Zone).  It also
does not list border changes that are listed (as most of these have
descriptions of why and/or are reasonable).

So, the maps from Traveller have changed considerably.

(Most of these map observations are based off the 17"x22" maps from Deluxe
Traveller and MegaTraveller)

Absolutely.  But the signal travels at light-speed.

IMTU, it depends on how many "jump cycles" per second the ship is
stuttering and the length of each "jump."  The ship is never outside
of real space, with each "jump" being instantaneous, so its movement
closely simulates continuous movement.

Well, the problem is, a round optimized for hypersonic flight will NOT be
even close to silent- relatively low-velocity rounds like the 9mm don\'t have
this problem, but as the 4mm is optimized for VERY high velocities, I would
imagine the effects would be evne worse.   Also, as I mentioned, a subsonic
4mm round will have comparitively weak energy (it\'s light, and now slow,
maybe as effective as a .22), carrying power (at subsonic velocities, its
presumably long, thin shape is more susceptible to buffetting and drag) and
its penetration will be negligible.  Still good for close-range sniping, but
as I see it, you would need special "silent" magazines for real
effectiveness.  This would also make it (slightly) harder for criminals to
use.

Remember, Gauss weapons have recoil and EM signature!  A 20mm would show up
real easy on a MAD- probably even better than a CPR slugthrower would on IR.
While the constant accelleration of the gauss projectile very slightly
lessens the recoil, the higher velocity still makes this a bipod-fired
weapon for most users.  Finally, for a sniper weapon, an x-ray laser is the
bestest!

Yep, I hear you.  I have a CoCo 2 in the closet next to the TRS80,

OS9 is still used in a number of embedded applications.  I think
it\'s used in set-top boxes.

I\'m not sure I could find the floppy, but I used them and the

programmed star generation and character creation programs on data

I hear you.  BASIC is good for quick and dirty, but pascal\'s data

programs.  Did you buy an OS9 Pascal?  I looked at one, but never
bought it.

ObTrav...all the discussion of programming in the distant future,

I\'ll be the first to admit that even though I put an average of about 6,000
rounds per year through my HK USP and AR-15 Match, I don\'t know much about
how the projectile\'s shape affects hypersonic flight and it\'s effectiveness.
Is there a canon reference to the magazines being loud?  I\'ve not seen one.

I guess I don\'t understand how a frictionless barrel with no chemical
propellant causes recoil.  How\'s the EM sig generated?  By MAD are you
reffering to Magnetic Anomoly Detector or something else?  That\'s the only
abbreviation I know for MAD (aside from Mutually Assured Destruction that is
:)  I won\'t argue the x-ray laser.  <SIZZLE>

Ditzie would also like some more detail, as way down on her \'To Do\' pile is
the FS Gauss Carbine, on the grounds Marketing (or, as she says,
Maaaaaarketing-ting-ting-ting) have come up with the slogan "At forty
rounds a second, the loudest sound from a Famile Spofulam Gauss Carbine
comes from the creak of the Ardalope-Hide trigger. Unless of course you
jack the velocity up to 2000 meters per second, like we do".

Now, will I have to build this baby with a dual magazine, or not ?

PS  I took a little different approach with this one.  The players are
the "calvary" in this scenario.  They came rushing up on this docking
bay, flying low over the streets of Mos Eisley, and saw the glow of
blaster fire in the darkness.  It was this lone NPC SpecForce operative
holding her own against a squad of stormtroopers.  I thought it would be
cool to see what the story would be like from opposite the game--from
the NPC\'s perspective, as she saw the player\'s ship come rushing in over
head to the rescue...

10 SECONDS IN THE LIFE OF JANNA BAEL

a short Star Wars story

by Kenneth D. Bearden  (Based on our last game, from the perspective of
the Rebel SpecForce NPC Janna Bael)

- ----



It was late and hot, and Janna Bael had just made a mistake that could
end her life.

Her entire team had been taken out less than an hour ago.  Twelve of
them had come--all of them highly trained by the Rebel Alliance.  Their
mission:  Obtain the R2 Droid aboard the Rebel freighter Eucliptan
Morae.  Return it safely to the Alliance Fallback Base.

They knew the ship was being watched in its berth at docking bay 73,
situated deep on the south edge of the city.  Intelligence had told them

that.  But, their commander was young and green, and he had led them
into a firefight.

Janna knew that Intelligence might have gotten something wrong under the

current circumstances.  It wasn\'t only a probability.  It was probable.
But, Lt. Barnes stuck to the plan set up back at the base.  He wasn\'t
seasoned enough to think on his feet in a combat situation.

The second Imperial team hit them from the opposite flank, and the
blaster bolts began flying.  The Lt., the poor bastard, was one of the
first to catch one of them.

Sergeant Reeves took command of the team at that point.  Reeves was a
good man.  Janna had served with him a long time.  The safe move would
have been to fall back, regroup, and assess the situation.  Reeves knew
this, but he also knew that coordinates to the Alliance\'s secret Rebel
Base wasn\'t something you gambled with.  You didn\'t give stormtroopers
even a chance at this sort of information.

Reeves ordered the team to push forward toward the ship.  They took it,
but their team of 12 had dropped to four, and Reeves wasn\'t one of the
lucky ones.

As the trooper with seniority, Janna took command, and she knew it would

only be minutes, or less, before Imperial reinforcements arrived.

Sledggge and Dekon she ordered to disable the ship.  Parrrwar posted
lookout while Janna locked in a command code on the Droid and ordered it

to erase the base data if the team was captured or killed.

Parrrwar engaged stormtroopers just outside the bay.  Janna ordered
Sledggge and Dekon out to assist, then instructed the Droid to wait by
the ship\'s landing ramp.

When Janna exited to join the firefight, she was the only one left.  The

troopers spotted her and began firing.  She did the only thing she could

do.  She made a run for it.

The troopers chased her, and she ducked into the bay\'s maintenance
garage.  Over her comlink, she ordered the R2 unit to hide.  For the
next 42 minutes, it was a cat and mouse game with the stormtroopers.
She was alone.  She hadn\'t completed her mission.  And, she wasn\'t quite

sure where the Droid was hiding.

Safe for a moment on the roof of a building, Janna tried to call for
reinforcements from the base.  Static barked back at her.  The Imperials

had instituted communications jamming.  She was in trouble.

She kept circling the bay, moving from building to building but keeping
the docking bay in her line of sight.  Although it was risky to move,
she knew that staying put in one place would be  inviting the
stormtroopers to find her.  Her training had taught her that.  She would

move, listen, try her comm, then move again.

Finally...someone answered.  She had either made it outside the jamming
range, or the Imperials had decided that the disruption to their own
communications was too hindering.

Over the pre-set frequency came some alien voice, but she didn\'t really
much care.  She\'d take any help she could get.  They talked in code, and

she did her best to tell the respondent that she was alone.

And the alien replied, "We are coming...over."

A chill rushed through her.  She sprinted across the street, into the
docking bay complex.  No stormtroopers.  Moments later, she was on the
ship.  Again, no stormtroopers, but no Droid either.

Outside the ship, she switched frequency to contact the Droid.  The
warble of the R2 unit came back to her both over the comm and to her
ear.  He was close.  She looked at the vehicle garage across the bay.
There, on the deck of a cargo skiff, the red and blue lights on the R2
unit glowed back at her.  Moments later, she boarded the skiff...


...and that\'s when it became apparent that she wasn\'t the only one who
had heard the Droid\'s reply.  Blaster bolts came flying at her from the
street entrance.  The stormtroopers were back.

Janna hit the accelerator.  The Droid skidded across the deck of the
speeder with the sudden movement.  She positioned the skiff close to the

ship in the bay to provide cover to her rear flank.  Then she kneeled on

the skiff\'s deck and returned fire.  Blaster bolts slammed into the
skiff and the ship behind her.

It wasn\'t looking good.

Like magic, a ship appeared out of nowhere.  It was one of those
Corellian YT freighters--it\'s command pod raised between the two bow
mandibles instead of skewed to one of the sides.

At the sight of the ship, the stormtrooper attack heated into a vicious
thrust.  Janna kept returning fire, keeping her concentration on the
immediate threat in front of her.  It wasn\'t until she heard the scream
of Twin Ion Engines that she looked up.

The bulk of the freighter almost blotted out the entire night sky, but
she noticed the ship\'s entry ramp was already open.  Near the lip of the

ramp stood a skinny Wookiee with a small, frog-like creature on his
back.  Turbolaser bolts scorched across the sky from aft of the ship,
exploding into the freighter\'s drive section. The light from the energy
release lit up the entire docking bay.  As the ship rocked from the
impact, the Wookiee and the green frog-thing were thrown off the ramp.
They were falling, head over feet, about 30 meters over the Eucliptan
Morae\'s dorsal spine.

And this was when Janna witnessed a true miracle.  The frog-creature had

fell away from the Wookiee, but the Wookiee somersaulted and reached out

with his two long hairy arms to grab the creature by it\'s spotty legs.
As the two of them fell, the Wookiee pulled the frog-creature around his

neck and clasped its legs together with one hand using a grasp at the
ankles.  Simultaneously, the Wookiee was falling and twisting, head over

foot.

Janna doesn\'t know how, but the Wookiees last spin landed him on the
upper hull of the Morae, feet first.  The Wookiee stumbled, took three
short steps that made him look drunk, then steadied himself.  One hand
still clasped the frog creature\'s legs, but the frog was jerking around
on the Wookiee\'s back like a loose flap of skin.  The long snout on the
creature was yelling something in an alien tongue that echoed in the
docking bay and sounded something like, "Tic Tonnannon....Wow!"

The freighter began to lower itself into the bay, and for a moment,
Janna thought that the ship was going to land on top of the other
ship--and her.  In the crack of night sky that she could see between the

edge of the docking bay and the looming freighter, she could see four
TIE fighters streak by on a close attack vector.  The quad mount in the
freighter\'s ventral turret swiveled to track these starfighters, and
although it was impossible, Janna could feel the gunner achieve his
lock.

Blam.  Blam.  The four turbolasers fired a millisecond behind each
other.  She couldn\'t see the fireball, but the night sky lit up like the

morning had arrived.  The thunder and concussion was enough to make the
stormtroopers stop firing at her.

Janna pulled her comlink and shouted.  No response, she acted fast,
switched to a general push--damn the troopers--and shouted again.

"Noooo!  The ship is disabled!"

Yes to all of the above.  Particularly 2.  I hate learning rules.  

Also:  There should be lots and lots and lots of examples of how to do
everything.  They shouldn\'t be interspersed with the rules though - this
makes things too hard to find.  

Personally, I would like a booklet format - the rules are in one or three
of them, the examples are in another, accurately cross-referenced(!!!), and
with a big booklet on how to referee, design scenarios, and so on.  This
was the biggest glitch in CT - it left you on your own in this area.

And then you stick in the setting stuff, completely separate from the
mechanics.  You can add the optional complex rules later.  They should have
lots of examples too.

Of course all this really requires you to go with a box, rather than a book
format.  So what?  Stick the booklets together to make the book - just have
the boxed version there for those of us with tiny brains.

Well, not the magazines themselves, I mean magazines pre-loaded with
specially designed sub-sonic ammo, the only difference in the magazine
itself would probably be some sort of "catch" that tells the weapon to fire
subsonic only.

Well, basically, it\'s all action and reaction. The entire recoil of a
conventional firearm is produced by the bullet and gasses escaping from the
front of the weapon.  In the case of a recoiless gun, the energy of the
balance mass equals the energy of the projectile plus expelled propellent.
A gauss weapon only worries about the projectile, but its action-reaction.
BTW, HEPLAR drives, ion drives, in fact all rockets work on the principal of
expelling mass at high velocity to produce thrust.  In guns, an admittedly
inefficient thruster, the proplulsion is know as recoil.  And while the lack
of gasses would reduce recoil, it would not even come close to eliminating
it.  As for MAD signature, you are correct, and trust me, that intense a
spike of local magnetic activity would show up on present-day sensors.  By
definition, the gauss weapon is using an intense magnetic field to
accelerate a projectile.  Since in most enviroments, ie no ferrous rocks
intervening, you can detect this anaomoly THROUGH the terrain, firing a
gauss weapon will quickly and unerringly pont out your position.  I freely
admit however, I have no idea if this effect could be easily shielded or
not.  All this aside, the gauss rifle would still be more useful than a CPR.
Even the supersonic rounds aren\'t that easy to detect.  If you have ever
been in the butts, you will no what I mean.  The crack of the bullet would
be loud, but by itself would give no real indication of where it was coming
from to the individual troop.

Well,  40rounds/sec looks good, until you realize your mag only holds 2-3
bursts.  I\'ll set mine to 5 round bursts, thanks, and at 2000/sec, you\'re
using expensive alloys, as steel will be glowing enough to provide tracer
effects in dim light.  Also, putting that many joules throught he barrel
will presumably turn your rifle to plasma in short order.  Remember entropy-
a certain, probably large, percentage of the current you use for the
magentics will inevitably escape as heat, and the canon gauss weapon can\'t
use cartridge cases to "sink" it, and the closer to frictionless the barrel
is, the less is transferred to the projectile.  I would think that
velocities of <1000m/s would be far more useful.   But dual magazines would
be neato.

The Scout Service are the people out there in Far Frontiers Sector (for
instance) three sectors spinward of the Marches and only half a sector
rimward of the Zhodani Consulate who are engaged in "exploration".  If
the Imperium was to send a Naval ship there this might create a
diplomatic incident.  If the _same_ ship is transfered to the Scout
Service and used as a "base ship" for a large "scouting" (ie spying)
mission it will be less objectionable.  The Scout Service is (IMTU and
to a certain degree in canon) the Imperiums service of choice for
extraimperial missions of the  "When you\'ve got them by the ba*** their
hearts and minds will follow" type.

This has already happened. There was a chip (probably still is) that
executes "p-code" directly. P-code was a sort of "medium level"
language developed from Pascal as a sort of "intro to machine language"
(or so I was told).

And I\'ve heard rumors of chips that execute the basic Forth
code set and "tiny BASIC" as their "machine language".

Info on how to decrypt a message encrypted with a known system. And in
the case of public key ciphers, with a known public key.

I\'m talking about the techniques used to decrypt a ciphered message
when you have no idea what system was used to encrypt it. In other
words *cryptanalysis* techniques.

True. But it doesn\'t *hurt* either.

I suggest that you try telling this to the NSA. It is a *fact* that
they will not disclose *algorithms*. And their reason is that it
*might* make it easier to crack the ciphers.

Heck, just think back to the cipher that was offered as a replacement
for DES. The NSa *refused* to make the algorithm public.

On the contrary. It helps considerably. Just *try* decrypting a message
encrypted with DES with one of the RSA key-search engines. 

Just consider what happened to the "knapsack" based ciphers when there
was a breakthrough in number theory. Suddenly the "hard" mathematical

Last time I looked, the consensus was that the NSA knew a *lot* that
the academic community didn\'t on the subject. And they aren\'t about to
release any of it.

And as I noted above, you can\'t try keys unless you know *which* cipher
was used. So there have to be ways to determine which cipher was used.

And again, as I noted, brute force is used because the algorithm is
mathematically hard to reverse engineer. And ciphers have been dropped
when it became easy to reverse engineer the algorithm.

Sorry, but the public key codes are based on factoring *large* numbers.
Generating a key requires coming up with two *large* prime numbers. You
also generate their product.

You encrypt and decrypt by doing binary multiplication of your key and
the text (converted into a *huge* binary number). 

So in effect you are multiplying 30 or 40 digit number (the key) by a
several hundred digit number. And you decrypt by dividing the result by
another 30 or 40 digit number.

There are more details than this. But you get the idea. A cipher that
requires several *weeks* to encrypt a message is not going to get used.

And how long would it have taken to do a 100 word message? 

Like I said. Without a computer, forget it. 

And those machines *are* computers. Dedicated to a specific

Just keep in mind the fact that transistors have existed for about the
same amount of time. And we\'ve already hit the *limits* on many of
their applications. 

It no longer needs centuries to go from first application to fully
mature technology. 

Yes, programming will evolve. Being a subset of mathematics, it will
evolve indefinitely. But it won\'t necessarily be unrecognizable.

"By definition" writing is one of the things that makes you TL 1. 

It\'s a *lot* more advanced concept than it appears to be. The idea that
marks *represent* something is not simple.

But it\'s still *inherently* impossible to have an atmosphere that has
very thin through dense *pressure*, but no oxygen. Yet this *should* be
common. 

Well, you can have it as "exotic". But that just screws up the
probability. Because that sort of atmosphere should actually be pretty
*common*.

Actually, computers are computers. The software doesn\'t really care
that much about the underlying hardware. Or rather, the *program*
doesn\'t. The compiler/interpreter does. 

Programming (and hence, software) is a matter of rules and logic. It\'s
a form of math. Really.

Except that they *aren\'t*. He *made* them equally likely by *saying*
that they were. His argument is circular.

In actuality, there are millions of quantum level events involved in
the toss of a die. If the die is not loaded, then in 1/6th of those
event chains it\'ll come up a 1. If it\'s loaded, then it\'ll come up 1 in
most of them.

The probabilities of macroscopic events are the proportion of the total
possible events AT THE QUANTUM LEVEL that come out in a given way.

Actually, the "Imperial parsec" might *not* be equal to the "Terran
parsec". All they have to be is *close*. And then folks will cheerfully
keep using the old term for the new unit. Much like "nautical miles"
which actually have *no* relation to miles. Instead they are based on
angle (really!).

So if I ever have to explain it, I\'ll just say that the max range of a
J1 drive just happens to be within 1% of a "real" parsec. 

It\'s a coincidence. Much like the fact that c is pretty close to "1
g-year" (9.8 * 86400 * 365 = 3.090528e8 m/s). Interesting, but of no
*real* significance.

Actually, it *doesn\'t* disprove parallelism. Such phenomena are
*common* at the subatomic level. And physicists don\'t see them as
disproving the "many worlds" model. 

Nothing says that there has to be just *one* universe per possible
outcome. Just that there has to be *at least* one. The probabilities
reflect the number in which each of the various outcomes occurs.

> I throw it out to the list: does anyone have an example of a

Pion decay. As i recall, there\'s a pion that can decay into either two
*or* three particles. One is far more likely than the other.

But the problem is that there is an essentially *infinite* number of
ways for *any* decay to take place. Since momentum needs to be
conserved, the momentum of the resultant particles has to add up to the
same as that of the original particle. But there are an *infinite*
number of ways to do this. Even if all the resultants share the
momentum equally, there\'s the matter of what *directions* they are
going in. 

So you see, the idea of "only" a few outcomes is incorrect. 

Infinities are *common* in quantum theory. This is just another one.

Which is one of the objections I\'ve had to Traveller\'s world gen rules
from the start. The atmosphere types have this *huge* built-in
assumption. 

> I\'m more interested in the corrolary: Any Traveller world with a thin to
> dense atmosphere will have a fairly mature ecosphere.

Like I said, a *huge* built-in assumption.

I\'d really like a system generation system that makes more physical
sense. The planets will tend to depend on what sort of star you have
(and for going from pre-generated planets to system details, the star
types need to be *really* limited!).

One *major* detail should be that oxygen atmospheres will require both
life *and* a fairly "old" planet. 

Without life, a planet like earth should have a mostly nitrogen
atmosphere with a fair amount of CO2. Hydro should be "normal", maybe a
bit higher than on earth (most of the O2 in the air came from water,
not CO2).

Get it a bit warmer and you get CO2 runaway like Venus. Get it a bit
colder and you\'ll have frozen oceans, and maybe massive glaciation. But
still the N2/CO2 atmosphere.

A few *rare* planets should have odd elemental abundances, and thus
have atmospheres with odd active gases (and life to go with them).
Chlorine atmosphere not only require lots of chlorine, but some sort of
life form that keeps replacing the chlorine. 

Heck, there\'s strong evidence that the presence/absence of life will
even affect *mineral* deposits!

So we really should have the atmosphere chart just list pressure, and
have a seperate roll for planetary age, and a roll for life. Atmosphere
*composition* would depend on age and life.

	I am no biologist either, but we humans only have two alleles per 
gene. Imagine this race has not two, but eight copies of each. 
Redundancy! It takes several simultaneous mutations for one to get 
fro the genotype to the phenotype. And this has a very, very low 
probability...

I suppose he means that the distribution is *not* uniform. In fact, 
in RL there is simply no way to get the average only from the minimum 
and the maximum. You need a (preferably large) sample of temperatures 
at all times.

Nope. The galaxy doesn\'t really *have* a "radius". It just sort of
"peters out". Any "edge" is a purely *arbitrary* decision.

Won\'t help. If the world is that radioactive, they\'ll have
radio-isotopes as *part* of their bodies.

That\'s what the bacteria and algae that manage to live *inside* active
reactors have. Yes, there really *are* such critters. They can even be
a nuisance by clogging filters.

Muticellular life will have a harder time of it, but it may be
possible. 

Another item that is needed is a cellular "scrubber" mechanism that
will neutralize un-wanted "free radicals" almost immediately. That\'s
how most of the damage from radiation occurs. The radiation breaks up a
molecule, which leaves the pieces as very reactive free radicals. They
react with things they shouldn\'t and screw stuff up.

Well, in general the colder something gets, the less reactive it is. So
your corrosive will be a *lot* less corrosive than it would be at
normal temperatures. 

Just off the top of my head, at those temps it\'d have to be chlorine,
fluorine, or *possibly* some gases such as HCl (hydrogen chloride), HF
(hydrogen fluoride). I think those are about all the gasses that are
likely to be both gases and corrosive at those temps. But you\'ll have
to look up the boiling points of HF and HCl. Cl boils at -37 so it\'d be
liquid most of the time.

Oops! I forgot the pressure. At 25 ATM I suspect only the fluorine will
be a gas.

Well, you *can\'t* extract *any* from fluorine. It\'s an element. There
won\'t be *any* water. Oxygen would exist only as Oxygen fluoride (OF?)
which is both corrosive itself, and not too stable. As in expose it to
metal or anything that flourine likes *better* than oxygen, and you\'ll
wind up with the flurine combining with the "whatever" and the
released oxygen atom (which will be *highly* reactive) trying to grab
some for itself.

My advice is to hit a used book store that has a "technical books"
section (or hit a college bookstore, where it may cost more) and grab a
copy of the CRC Handbook of chemistry and physics. One *invaluable*
section it\'ll have is several hundred pages (it\'s a *big* book) listing
the properties of inorganic compounds. 

With that table, you can look up all sorts of compounds and check out
their properties for this sort of thing. 

Damn near *everything* on a planet like this would be fluorides of one
sort or another. And damned if I know how it could form. But it\'s about
the only thing I can think of that\'d fit.

It  is quite simple to adjust the muzzle-energy of a gauss-weapon (just another

IMHO changing the magazine of a gauss-weapon is just not worth the trouble. You

If I\'m correct, the crux of the matter is that the infinite series of
1/(2^x) where x=1..infinity is some finite number. (Though I could be wrong,
I haven\'t done convergent series stuff since first year university about 9
years ago). I think the Greeks were unaware of the fact that some infinite
series sum up to a finite sum, seeing as they didn\'t have much algebra.

Zeno\'s paradox also assumes the infinite sub-dividablity (is that a word?)
of space - one could argue that at some point Achilles takes a step that\'s
smaller than the diameter of an electron, which isn\'t possible, so QED (or
whatever the math guys says when they prove something).

I thought the problem with an X-ray laser was the ionisation trail
through an atmosphere.

The combination of persistance of vision and the ionisation
being greater near the barrel means that you get a large arrow
pointing at the sniper and saying:

	"It was him! He did it!"

Of course, I could be wrong.

As I don\'t particularly like guaranteed unbreakable codes IMTU as sometimes
canon (Trillion Credit Squadron mentions that a player capturing an enemy
vessel might learn their orders) and lots of high tech staple relies on the
assumption that codes can be broken by other means than brute force
numbercrunching: I hold (IMTU) that the terrans was far advanced in some
science areas but lacking in others, mostly mathematics. Terrans beat the
Vilani by having mesonguns, more warfare experience (some would say
bloodlust), the knowledge of biowarfare but the ramshackle empire failed in
part because of a Vilani math invention: the Vilani had knowledge on how to
take shortcuts when calculating primes; there are (supposedly IMTU) ways to
calculate primes MUCH (it has not been proven that there aren\'t better ways
to calculate primes than the brute force methods we use today, right?).
This gives the Vilani the ability to break just about any communication
codes but they didn\'t win the war by that as they didn\'t use public/private
key systems anyway. The problems for the Terrans started when the Terrans
learned how to break the codes; all kinds of hackers everywhere were
suddenly able to steal from banks, commandeer vehicles etc and the crypto
systems were pretty much everywhere with the Terrans so it was an
impoosible task to change and thus the long night.

All IMTU of course.

	This is a point that is very applicable to Traveller.  My gaming
group places Shadowrun at the top of the list of games with good
mechanics.  We need a good set of mechanics for T5.  T4 didn\'t do it.
Gurps doesn\'t do it (for me.)

Shrug.  A mask which does oxygen extraction is perfectly viable unless the
oxygen concentration is _very_ low.  In any case, \'low oxygen content\' is a
standard taint (per world builder\'s handbook at least, probably others).  I
agree that a nitrogen-CO2 atmosphere would be considered \'exotic\'.

Actually, in this case I disagree, because you\'re explaning scores of planets
with only a _single_ action -- \'The early droyne terraformed many worlds in the
areas they passed through\'.  Unlike many things to explain by reference to the
ancients, it isn\'t even an action which is all that nonsensical (for that
matter, you can also explain it by having them terraformed in more recent
history, or during the first or second imperium.  Terraforming is really only
TL 9-10).

Well, taking a current example, no Underway replenishment tankers can
keep up with the capital ships of a Wet Navy.

Anyway, it was taken from a canon source. YMMV.

If they are tankers (i.e. their cargo is fuel anyway), why do they need
collapsible fuel tanks?

Maybe some people won\'t like me for this.
There is that damnd second law of thermodynamics, the one about entropy, which
_cannot_ decrease, a fundamental of modern physics.

Some of it\'s consequences are efficiencies (differences between input energies and
discharge energies, for example) or the impossibility of a \'perpetuum mobile\'.

Really GREAT post.  Saving this.  Many adventure ideas.

My original idea was a very small ore sample (or purified ingot) recovered
from a passenger\'s belongings after he fails to return to the ship.  (He had
some of his reasearch with him which the bad guys got and are now looking
for more and the sample.)  How much would a troy ounce volume of gold weigh
if that volume were filled with an ingot of atomic weight 500 matter?  Is it
a direct ratio?  If the element has 50 times the atomic weight it weighs 50
times as much for the same volume of metal?

Bad assumtion.  Only the critical path matters.  Power and other
support/control lines are static and of no consiquence.  Also, millimeter
radar is targeting radar not search but lets look at that.  The path lenght
has to let the system react before it is detected by the oposing ships
sensors.  1 wavelength bounce back is NOT a detection (to many falses if the
front in can lock up that fast).  You could cancel with any 180 degree
multiple.  180, 540, 720, 900 ect.  Also in 3000 years there should be
superconducters able to match or out perform partial vacume (not the fastest
medium).

I think you mean a \'frequency agile\' radar.

True, but that type gear has its\' own problems with range and the design of
the front end.  Also each part of the radars \'agile\' band would be canceled
by a different bank of circuits set to that part of the band.  Wit h
adaptive circuits the target would \'signature\' the radar quickly and be able
to predict and match the shift quicker become more stealthy.  Two different
but linked cooperative systems would help.  Dopolar has a better potential
here for detecting a moving object with fewer false positives and greater
range.  There are also other, non radar methods, that would be less likely
to produce false positives.  Bruce discussed them some time ago.  I would
tend to use them and drop the radar.  Much more efficient.  It all comes
down to $s.  Who is willing to spend how much to do what.  How many systems
will spend 1Tcr on system monitoring systems?  How many people will build
purpose built bleeding edge spy ships?

Or a black globe.  A connon device.  They absorb all energy.  I was

Good point, but are spy ships going to be \'normal\' ships?  Spying with a far
trader does not sound to bright unless you are actually trading while you
are monitoring system trafic.  A perfectly reasonable way to spy by the way.
An the customs people can\'t say but so much if a ships has really good
commo. and nav. gear.

All true, but tough to do in space.  I did mention \'reference object\' with
that in mind.  If an object \'behind\' the canceling ship is also invisable
then you sensor tech. hits the big red button.

I expected that.  What I ment was why would you use these bands.  They are
not very efficent for a global search.  The propoerties of that part of the

Large sources of ferrous materials will not effectively shield the gauss
weapon although it may reduce the detection range.  MAD equipment
detects changes in the planetary magnetic field, thus the only way to
mask an electromagnetic source would be to enclose it in an equal and
oppisite magnetic field.  This would reduce the effectivness of the
weapon, increase the weight, and increase the power requirements.
Currently MAD equipment is rare in usage but will be more common after
gauss weapons become common.  Also each shot will produce a single pulse
of radio (as the magnetic field changes) but this will be hard to detect
and home in on (frequency is dependent on barrel length and muzzle
velocity).

The US Army is now testing a system that can track bullets in real time
(predict target and locate shooter before the bullet can strike the
target) using active sonar.  Soon this will be attached to a weapon as a
fire control device.  This will be a vehicle mounted system as it
requires two sonars (sterioscopic) and two computers.  (seen on the
Discovery Channel)

Black globe generators, _as described in traveller_, violate the second law of
thermodynamics.  As such, either their description should be changed (in which
case a black globe would probably be a perfect blackbody, and would have an IR
signature), or you have to accept violations of thermodynamics.

Black globe generators, _as described in traveller_, violate the second law of
thermodynamics.  As such, either their description should be changed (in which
case a black globe would probably be a perfect blackbody, and would have an IR
signature), or you have to accept violations of thermodynamics.

From what I understand, in "slug throwers", all you need to do to make
supersonic rounds subsonic is decrease the powder load in the casing.  Many
pistol rounds aren\'t exactly aerodynamic, anyway.  A round that tumbles is
actually a good thing when it hits flesh.

There is one round I know of where it is made up of flat discs that come
apart in flight and make a nice tight group when they hit the target.  The
flat discs aren\'t aerodynamic, but they COULD be subsonic.

Wouldn\'t it be just as worthless (if indeed, it WAS worthless) on full auto?
Rounds don\'t usually hit the same point of body armour, no matter how many
you spit out.  This is why the most protective body armours we have now are
made up of ceramic geometric shapes with underlying kevlar.  Chances are
very low that two rounds will hit in the same area of one of the ceramic
shapes.  (The ceramic shatters when hit, opening up a vulnerable spot for a
second round, were it to hit in that same spot.)

P.S.:  Gauss doesn\'t use rifling, does it?  If so, would a slower
feet/second speed make the trajectory more unstable after leaving a barrel
rifled for a higher velocity projectile?

Someone a while back did what could quite possibly be the ultimate
terror/sniper weapon.
The MESON Sniper Rifle!

I think this was a TNE gadget made with FF&S.  Basicaly a weapon that did
not interact with any matter it went through, only where it was intened to
detonate (ergo, no ion trail).  The damage was only 1 point, but that one
point was enough to damage internal organs or the brain of the target,
causing instant death.  The target has an apparent heart attack or brain
hemorage. NASTY!

Unfortuneately, G:T has forbade these wondrous toys.  Can\'t see why they\'d
do a thing like that. ;->

My kinda gun afficionado!  When I was in the Army I had a AR-15A2 Delta
HBAR.  If I had been old enough to buy a pistol, it would have been a H&K P7
or a H&K VP70Z, which had a pretty sinister and futuristic look.

For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.  The rifle has to
have something to push against, in this case your shoulder, to make the
round go down the barrel.  Otherwise, if the rifle was sitting in Zero G and
was remotely made to discharge, the round wouldn\'t come out of the barrel as
fast and the rifle would actually go flying linearly across the room,
probably tumbling because of lack of balance, too.  The mass and drag
coefficient of the rifle is greater than the round, so it will travel slower
than the round, but one item will go one way and the other will go the
opposite.

Another example might be holding a 12 guage shotgun very lightly in your
hands and having a hair trigger on it.  Make sure your hip or shoulder isn\'t
in the way.  Press the trigger and the gun will fly out of your hands.

The shell will still discharge its load, but not with the same force as it
would had you held it firmly against your shoulder.  Of course, when you are
talking about the speeds at which weapons spit out projectiles, the
reduction caused by wimply handling won\'t help much if you\'re standing in
front of the barrel when it goes off.

Shooting a 12 guage as it is braced against a brick wall would be optimum if
you could aim it accurately...

If the radiation source is endemic, coming from the planet itself, then
off the top of my head, I would posit a hell of a free radical
scavenging system. 

Much of the damage from ionizing radiation comes from the production of
free radicals. This critter will have Vitamin C, E and A requirements
that make Linus Pauling look like he was dabbling with minor changes in
intake.

The organism will have a far more robust genetic encoding system...for
instance DNA with 6 strands and some sort of \'tell me three times\' error
correction system. A Much faster rate of genetic repair.

There will also be a faster rate of enzyme degradataion, and a
correspondingly higher rate of protein synthesis.

Along with those two comes a higher metabolic rate in general. This
implies a shorter lifespan, greater energy requirements, and given the
hostility of the environment, a high reproductive rate.

This would be for a free ranging organism without significant
environmental shielding from the radiation sources.

OTOH, if the source of radiation is extra-terrestrial (a very active
sun, ongoing radiation from a nearby astronomical source, etc) then
you\'ll get much of the opposite effect. The organsims will move from
shelter as little as possible, implying a very low metabolic rate.
Perhaps a very diurnal or distinct migratory patterns. They\'ll move into
natural shelters and stay there...cracjks in the ground, deep oceans,
etc.

Taken from Q&A in NEW SCIENTIST magazine:

Q. I have heard that it is possible to live on Guinness and milk alone.
   Is this true, or even partially true?

A. This is not quite true. Guinness does contain many  vitamins and
 minerals in small quantities, but is lacking vitamin C, as well as
 calcium and fat.

 So, to fulfil all of your daily nutritional requirements you would need
 to drink a glass of orange juice, two glasses of milk, and 47 pints of
 Guinness.

A cracking set of books; sadly I don\'t have a copy anymore. Haven\'t read
them for a few years, but I loveed the claustrophobic feel....

Fuedal Technocracy (and I\'m not trolling). The noble class are owed fealty
effectively, and are megacorps/small nations in their own right. Each
controls access to its own product base...

I agree, time to switch over to Ral Talsorian\'s Mekton Zeta
Plus...  Interlock (Cyberpunk) gaming system, scaleable unified
gadget construction, blue hair, and more.  D10 + attribute + 
skill vs target number.  Simple, is it not?

Before you run to the hills screaming, "Aieee anime!"  MZ+ has
no problem working with hard sci-fi, too.  [My Shadow Command
campaign is set in 2004 and is very \'down to earth\'.]

	"Rifle"-like spin is imparted by puttinb a bias on the magnetic

compensate for the velocity difference

In theory, you can do it with GT and gurps lite (available on SJgames website,
I don\'t recall where).  In practice, other books would be good; Basic, and
probably either Space or compendium II (for effects of alien environments), and
a variety of other books could be handy.

You need a copy of the GURPS rules to play.  There is a "lite" version
available at www.sjgames.com that should cover most of what you need.

You just discovered why I believe that any *practical* man portable
guass weapon will be a "rail gun" using *permanent* magnets, and most
of the heat will be from the current in the rails and across the
"slug". 

The best part is that there\'s no switching of power between coils and
all that. Current starts to flow as the needle drops into place (and
shorts between the rails) and stops as the needle clears the rails. 
The safety kills the current to the rails.

The 65.7 figure is the average temp at the 4th hex row on the standard map.
 The 212.4 is high noon at the equator, and 49 is the lowest temp at the

I\'d have to give the "edge" to RSB, though i like them both (probably the best
G:T book so far, including Star Mercs, IMO).  It has library data, ship
designs, a Ref\'s section w/ more mysteries and info and covers the whole
Regency, not just the Spinward Marches.  I\'d have much prefered BtC to be a
"Domain of Deneb" sourcebook that would\'ve covered the Islands, etc.  The
\'recent events\' sections of both are about comparable.   Yes, the coverage is
lighter in RSB, since over half the book is UWPs and subsector maps, but it
covers a "bigger picture."   Plus in over 50 pages less than BtC.  A 150pg RSB
would\'ve been *awesome.*  It also doesn\'t have the typographical errors that
just bug the hell out of me, for some reason...  I like it BtC, but like the
RSB more... course, it might just be the GDW (and TNE) on the cover...  nah.

That\'s what i took him to mean.  "Real" being "canon."  I think you\'re
overreacting, if you took it seriously.  I still heavily dislike the precedent
G:T has set but I\'m still supporting the line (though i haven\'t got Star
Mercs, and don\'t think i will...).  First In... i\'m interested, for various
reasons, for a world building system w/ the "latest\'" info (for however long
that\'ll be good).  I hope it covers everything from star to extended system.
Not being based off\'ve a UWP would be fine IMO.  The UWP is something invented
by the IISS bean counters and pigeon holers, it\'s not meant to be objective.
Base a G:T "UWP" off\'ve hte system in First In, reflecting the fact it has
Imperial biases behind it would be best IMO.  Far Trader seems interesting
since i\'m *kind of* interested in a good trade system (though will have to
review it in my FLGS to make a buy decision).  

What *I* want is the setting to do something, to go somewhere new, somewhere
Traveller hasn\'t been before.  That is what i\'m waiting for, probably in vain.
Supposedly there\'s a mystery that\'s going to be built and i\'d *really* like to
see that.  Adventures and adventure-ready source material...  I don\'t suppose
there\'s a chance we\'ll get tidbits in First In and Far Trader, though?  Just
getting a facelift on the same material is not going to sell me any more,
though... most of the alien volumes are probably *out* for that reason (i have
the K\'kree AM, but am interested in another take on them).  I have the Vargr
*4* times now (the AM, Cogs & Dogs, MT Ref\'s (basically a skim of the AM, it
appears), and G:T Aliens I.  Cogs & Dogs is the best IMO.  I got Aliens I for
the minor races (dont\' have anything Spacemaster) and for another look on the
Zhos (why was Sorag replaced w/ whatever anyways?)  I don\'t think i need
another look at the Aslan, Hivers (though if there was to be another Hive or
two... maybe further beyond the Hive Federation...<g>)

Are there going to be *any* "official" G:T adventures?  Or an adventure
book/anthology?  Or at least tidbits inserted in the books?  Or is this
"building mystery" just a lure?

I\'d agree the rules are largely irrelevant to existing Traveller players, and
experienced gamers, in general (especially for me, as i don\'t intend to use
them, in any case, being happy w/ TNE.  You\'re happy w/ G:T.  Others are happy
w/ the DGP system or even the "2d6 and pray" system.  Still others here use
CORPS or even something else...anyone playing Alterntity Traveller?).  I
heartily disagree that it\'s irrelevant for everyone.  Or that yet another take
on teh same setting will sell, as is.  It will sell if it has something new.
The grognards are going to buy pretty much anything w/ a Traveller logo on it,
at least a few volumes of it, too.  T4 proved that.  It also proved that the
grognards are not enough.  People who haven\'t been impressed by previous
incarnations aren\'t going to slavishly jump on board unless there\'s something
to attract them.   People both acquainted w/ Traveller, but who aren\'t die-
hards, *and* new blood needs to be had...maybe the GURPS\'ers will be enough...
or maybe G:T has always been intended as a temporary interlude until T5.  I
wonder if the license will be continued if, and when, T5 actually comes out.
Or maybe it\'s been intended as permanent and there will be no indepedant
Traveller and T5 is a flying dutchman.  Or maybe they\'re intended to coexist.

I\'d really like T5 to do something bold and fresh.  Go to 3D starmapping, to
the New Era or to interstellar wars and/or the 4th Imperium/1st Republic (or
better yet, take the direction MT was going and have a bunch of polities in
Imperial space).  Break up the monolithic setting and introduce something
dynamic.  Stir the pot!

Sigh.  Pure Hollywood.  Man portable near C weapons
are beyond our reach.  Newton pretty much rules out
such super weapons.  (Equal and opposite reactions.)

Let\'s see, high tech sniper systems = high one shot 
lethality with minimal risk to the operator.

  Optically guided anti-personnel (mini) cruise missiles

  single shot 12.7mm sniper hover drone

  meson gun/orbital satellite slaved to the sniper\'s

    watch out for the guy with the fancy pen-light) *WEG*

Nope.  I\'m on the digest and aol and i\'m getting them fine, except when
someone does an attachment or that Microsloth garbage.  Course, i\'m on through
TCP/IP connection... but i just tried through the normal phone line and that
seems to work fine, too.  I\'d probably take it up w/ majordomo...  or probably
un- and re-sub, first, actually.  This is assuming nothing funky has been done

Radiation resistant bacteria have multiple copies of their

Perhaps hardware repair is a matter of asking the computer what it

the bits the computer thinks are busted...or tweaking the software to
work around the busted parts at a lower capability.

Getting information from the computers on a captured enemy ship would
probably mean you boarded it while the computer was still running, and
put a gun to the head of a person with enough security clearance to
keep it running. Easy to prevent, but things do go wrong in war.

No they don\'t exist, IIRC, as published canonical designs in Traveller,
but man-portable meson weapons certainly are possible with FFS (don\'t
remember offhand about FFS2)...as are plasma _pistols_. Made one once,
think I posted it to the list. It was a huge honking pistol (0.5 m long,
2 or 3 kg IIRC) with the recoil from hell, but it was a pistol,
nonetheless. Did something like 6 or 8 dice of damage, too.

It\'s what happens when you question the Traveller background.

(Kidding)

An EMP pulse, in it\'s only real-world form (of which I\'m aware) is what you
get when you set off a nuclear bomb - a big honking magnetic pulse that
expands outward. When the magnetic field crosses some conductor, the
magnetic field induces a current in the conductor. There\'s some sort of
calculus involved, but suffice it to say that if the magnetic field looks
like a big spike, the electrical current will also be a honkin\' big spike,
which is generally a bad thing. Electronic devices will short out,
transistors and other semiconductor devices will get fried, etc.

Presumably an EMP cannon is a gun that generates a honkin\' big magnetic
pulse that can be directed against electronics to blow them out without any
direct contact.

The problem if (of course) that I don\'t think it\'s really possible to
generate a magnetic field that big without a huge amount of energy or some
sort of undesirable side effects. But, assuming that that\'s the problem of
the engineering department, it\'s a neat toy.

It is possible to hardened equipment to make it effectively immune to big
magnetic fields, either by encasing it in a conductive wrapper or by
building it without electronics, with optics or hydraulics or somesuch
instead.

Yeah, and go serve another god.  The GM is god.  I don\'t see how you can say
anything else.  At any moment, the GM can collect character sheets, take
them, his books and his dice and toss them in an incinerator.  Heck, a GM
could even toss HIMSELF in an incinerator!  We don\'t even know if the
Creator of this universe (insert obligatory disclaimer for atheist\'s, here)
can do this!  So maybe GM\'s are MORE POWERFUL in their universe than the
Creator is in this one?

A god can also say, "You didn\'t quit.  You\'ve been killed."  A meteorite

Compendium I and Space are listed because it makes references

buy without them if you really  want to (you may not be

You need the GURPS: Basic Set, GURPS: Space is also highly recommended,
there are a number of references. Of course, I\'d highly recommend GURPS:
Space even if you weren\'t interested in GURPS.

Other books that might come in handy, but aren\'t required: Vehicles (2nd

Actually, even at a subatomic level, the concept of the universe splitting
works. This is the "many worlds" interpretation of quantum mechanics;
every time you perform a measurement the universe splits into an ensemble of
seperate universes. (It\'s not a particularly favoured interpretation for
assorted reasons, but it\'s legitimate.)

It would be next to impossible to stop a bullet from hitting its target
(sensors between the sniper and the target and laser as attached weapon
maybe??).  The system works at the speed of sound, so supersonic bullets
will most likely hit before anything could be done about it (it takes
time to trane a weapon on the target).  the purpose would be to limit
the number of shots that the sniper could take.

The distance required for the "sterioscopic vision" may preclude
mounting battledress (they showed the system with the sensors set 5m
apart). this distance could be shortened

Shrug.  When designing battleships w/G:Vehicles (for non-traveller settings) I
install a group.  Sensors have a field of view comparable to the human eye (by
the rules) which is pretty extreme; you can cover everything with 4 sensors.  A
rotating sensor turret covers 360 degree, which means you only need 2 sensors
(they can\'t see _through_ the ship they\'re on).  They way GT installs sensors
is a bit weird, tho.

Vehicles is great! I\'ve FFS and FFS2, and I think Vehicles is clearer
and easier to read and use than either. My design spreadsheet (for
Vehicles and GT) and up to 430k in Excel now, and getting bigger all
the time.

The Atlantic Class Heavy Cruiser is typical of the Imperial designs for
such ships: a long flattened structure studded with weaponry, flaring
aft for rudimentary control surfaces useful in fuel skimming. Well-
armed and well-armored, it fulfills the basic design requirement of
meeting the enemy and winning in battle.

The Atlantic class, however, is fast approaching obsolescence, and is
not the equal of more modern vessels in the Imperium and neighbouring
regions.  An upgrade program to enhance the class was considered, but
decided against because of cost, although a number of enhanced
prototypes have been reported.

This class of cruiser has lately proven popular with the Navy for
independent missions, especially beyond the Imperial borders. Used
alone, the ships are capable of a variety of diplomatic and scientific
operations.  Used in squadrons, they provide a useful show of force or
reinforcement for friendly client-states. The ship\'s cargo hold can be
used to barrack up to 100 marines for small commando operations,
boarding parties and general ship defence.

Reportedly, some examples of the Atlantic class have been fitted with
Black Globe force field generators. This has not been confirmed.

Construction: Atlantic class cruisers were produced by a variety of
yards throughout the Imperium, including within the Spinward Marches.
Ling Standard Products constructed four examples at Mora/Mora in the
period 1020 to 1030. The last Atlantic to be produced first flew in
1050 at Deneb.

A total of 794 ships were ultimately produced, of which approximately
500 remain in service. Depending on progress in current ship
construction, and on the atrographical region, the Atlantic class heavy
cruiser may be considered a first or second line ship. They are being
phased into second line assignments by the Navy as rapidly as newer
vessels can be obtained.

Transfers: Approximately 60 examples of the Atlantic class have been
transferred, sold or disposed of to client-states of the Imperium.
Recipients include several Vargr nations along the Corridor, Aslan
colonial governments allied with or friendly to the Imperium, and many
local human worlds within the Imperium.

I might try a design for a 70,000,000 mile sensor and see how big
it is...Ok :

PESA DESIGN:								
TL 11	PESA					
Scan:	52		58 in space		
Range:	7000000	miles	70000000 miles (112630000 km) in space		
Weight:	3500000	pds	1750 tons	
Volume:	70000 cf	140 spaces	
Cost:	2800200000 Cr	2800.2 MCr	
Power:	0 kW		0 MW		

Size in spaces:	140 (Sensor alone)	168 (with Pop Turret)
Pop Turret Specs:	17262	pds	84000	cf		
			575400	Cr	11508	sf Surface Area		

Tot Weight	1758.64 tons
Tot Cost	2800.7754 MCr

That\'s not very big...it IS expensive, though.

Hmmm, let me check my worksheet...the pop turret multiplies the
volume in the turret by 1.2 (I only included the sensors in the
turret, not the power segment), so I arrived at the following,
using standard materials and medium frame structure (the GT
default):


PESA DESIGN:

TL 12 PESA
Scan  : 46             52 in space
Range : 700000 miles   7000000 miles in space
Weight: 350000 pds     175 tons
Volume: 7000 cf        14  spaces
Cost  : 280200000 Cr   280.2 MCr
Power : 0 kW           0 MW

Size in spaces:   14 (Sensor alone), 17 (with Pop Turret)
Pop Turret Specs: 2479 pds, 8400 cf, 123950 Cr, 2479 sf Surface Area

Total Weight:     176.24 tons
Total Cost  :     280.32395 MCr

Looking at the pop turret specs, it doesn\'t take up a lot of the mass
or cost of the package.

Genetic redundancy might work well; DNA strands ten or twenty times longer
than ours, with twenty copies of each piece of information and a 
mechanism that causes the majority version to be what\'s duplicated or used
to regulate biological processes, etc. Or perhaps a symbiotic virus-like
organism that lives inside cells and continuously checks DNA during the cells
life; if it finds two discrepant genes it collects two more and then deletes
the most discrepant.

Long-term deep independent surveys (especially in regions with minor 
governments of various sorts...) 

Even charting a single solar system, if you\'re going to do it thoroughly,
could require more resources than most of us seem to think. Putting a ten-person
team into the major geologically or ecologically significant areas of an
uninhabited earth requires a crew of thousands...let alone trying to study
a representative sample of asteroids, planetary moons, martian environments,
etc. A flotilla of smaller ships might be more efficient than a dreadnaught,
but if you get the dreadnaught for free...A carrier might be an even better
choice, but the Kokirrak does have that big module space in the cargo hold
which could be converted to a hanger.

(It makes more sense with the AHLs, though - replace many of the fighters
with 15-ton gigs, replace some bays with more hanger space; with jump-5
it\'s a great survey ship, and 2-G is irrelevant for peaceful work.)

Recoil is proportional to muzzle energy, which in most Traveller systems
also happens to determine damage.

So the recoil "factor", in whatever system you are using, could be a direct
function of damage, in the same system.

That said, Megatraveller contradicts this general statement.  A gauss
pistol that does damage 4 has a recoil of "Low/R" and an auto pistol (9mm)
which does damage of 3 has a recoil of "Med/R".  The scale in that system
is basically 1 to 3 (and only important in zero-G, and for rapid fire), but
its the only example I have, and I think the gauss recoil should be higher.

Escaping propellent gasses may add somewhat to CPR recoil over Gauss, but I
think that this is not on an order of magnitude high enough to affect
damage values or recoil by a significant measure (over 10% or so).  That\'s
just a guess though.

Build a pyramid of superdense. That\'s good for probably 20-30000 years.
(until your natives discover this wonderful strike of elemental
superdense and mine it ;-) Beyond that, it\'s hard to say. At million
year timeframes you\'re running into problems with markers placed on the
crust of a planet because of plate tectonics, I\'d think.

The way to do it would be define 0 as that point that exactly lines up
at known angles with some well known stellar markers at exactly midnight
local time. Do this on the equator for greatest accuracy.

Still, though, you\'ll run into drift as the planet\'s rotational period
changes.

Well first, an EMP cannon would be something that fired a focused pulse
rather than somethig like a nuke EMP, which radiates out spherically
from the explosion. Basically it\'s _something_ that causes massive
inducted power surges in unprotected electronics in the path of the
effect. Note, it could simply be a big EMP generator which is shielded
on most of it\'s circumference, allowing the pulse out in only a certain
direction. A really big spark generator can cause a measurable effect.

Most likely it\'s is far lower power than a nuke EMP, maybe only having
ranges as far as a few tens of meters.

What would happen to you? I\'m not sure, since people don\'t seem to
suffer ill effects from nuclear generated EMP\'s, but that may be simply
a matter of scale. Humans are poorer conductors than say, copper, and
thus the induced currents are much smaller. Probably at the ranges at
which a nuke EMP has an effect on humans, the nuke effect is far
stronger...while humans are poor conductors, rapidly dissipating vapor
is even worse ;-)

Okay, GT says you can get by with GURPS lite, however in all reality you need 
GURPS basic as a bare minimum and Compendium I as well (not quite as 
essential as the rules but still pretty much required). Now you also need a 
playing area (world gen or pregenerated worlds), you can take a previous 
traveller system or sector and convert it; or you can get Behind the Claw or 
GURPS space or First In. So I\'d say the basic requirements are: GURPS basic 
rules, GURPS Traveller, Compendium I, and one of Behind the Claw or GURPS 
space or First In (a total of 4 books).

That comes very close to my current diet.

Ob. Trav.,  seems likely to me that there would be a market for one-food
diet product in the Traveller universe.

NeoGuinness!  10 pints a day is provides all the necessary life-sustaining
nutrients you need.

More realistically, a survival drink designed to provide all the nutrients
electrolytes, etc., to sustain life in harsh situations.  Can be consumed in
a vacsuit drink tube, or in easy-opening can.  Now Guinness-flavored!

book. It\'s far from hard-SF, but Delany does some interesting things with
the stuff. He describes worlds where the atmosphere has been transformed by
outgassing from "hell chasms," fissures in the planet\'s crust where
Illyrion has been allowed to slowly burn its way into the rock.

I never entirely liked lanthanum jump grids (didn\'t seem exotic enough) and
Illyrion was something semi-plausible that we haven\'t yet discovered -- but
we might, someday. As Leonard pointed out in a previous post, if such
superstable elements do exist, their exact properties are anybody\'s guess,
so your players can\'t nitpick their scientific accuracy.

BTW, _Nova_ (besides being a brilliant SF novel on every level) is chock
full of cool ideas just waiting to be mined for Trav adventures and
background: interstellar economic wars, noble-family rivalries, strange
forms of spoken English, wild socio-economic speculations, deeply strange

Not ludicrously expensive compared to a battleship, though; adding a 
percent or two to the command ship in a BatRon in exchange for the ability to
detect everything within an AU isn\'t a bad tradeoff.

GURPS active sensors are cheaper, if I recall correctly, so a 70,000,000
mile AESA should be fairly common...

(As per previous notes, a battleship will probably want multiple sensors,
but maybe only one would be the really big one.)

I disagree.  I think both are very important.  I hate a game I\'ve got to
tweak all the time.  I LIKE games that I can straight out of a book.

I\'d say the Setting is more important than the game\'s mechanics, but
mechanics are VERY important.  I put Traveller up because of the
mechanics and swithed to a game with a better mechanics system.  I\'m not
saying I won\'t go back to Trav, because I LOVE the setting--it\'s just
that I like other settings too.  And if I can have a great setting AND
great game mechanics, I\'m putting my gaming dollar there.

Okay, GT says you can get by with GURPS lite, however in all reality you
need
GURPS basic as a bare minimum and Compendium I as well (not quite as
essential as the rules but still pretty much required). Now you also need a
playing area (world gen or pregenerated worlds), you can take a previous
traveller system or sector and convert it; or you can get Behind the Claw or
GURPS space or First In. So I\'d say the basic requirements are: GURPS basic
rules, GURPS Traveller, Compendium I, and one of Behind the Claw or GURPS
space or First In (a total of 4 books).

Good news, bad news.

I\'m excited to hear that Marc has decided to enter the CRPG market.
I\'m disappointed that its with a game publisher who\'s claim to fame
is something I\'ve never heard of called "Rebel Moon" on a webpage that
hasn\'t been updated since 1996.

The only game developer I would trust with Traveller is Black Isle,
who has made Fallout and Baldur\'s Gate.  The two most successful
and highest quality Computer-RPG\'s out there.  Baldur\'s Gate has
done such an excellent job of bring a pencil and paper game to
the computer.

That they\'ve signed some help from Bethesda is good, especially if
they\'re paying attention to the leaps and bounds that Black Isle is
making.

I sure hope they\'re planning on multiplayer capability.

Thats rewriting the skill then to reflect knowledge.  IMO, thats a
research skill and not a law skill.  The practice of is primarily the
_interpretation_ and _application_ of laws.  Advanced subroutines
of a good computer could quickly digest decided cases on record
to give a lawyer a good description of how a specific law has been
interpreted in a given situation.

In my legal and gaming opinion, its takes a consciousness to practice
law.  So as long as its clear that the robot was only really conducting
legal research, as opposed to the actual practice of law, what you
suggest could work.  But I\'d put it in a pocket computer.

I usually put 6 in.  I have put 4 in (and a tetrahedron).  I
forget the angle of coverage of each.  Maybe I\'ll check vehicle
tonight if I remember.

I think the feeling is that a pop turrent can turn fast enough
that you don\'t miss anything and it saves you a few bucks (or
lets you put the money into one really good sensor).

>(2) Why pop turrets rather than normal turrets? Is it for protection? (Is

It so it can stick out and get a good look around.

Do it that way if it seems more likely to you.  I can\'t think of
any rules or canon that would prevent you.

Cool! Someone else who likes Delany! I agree, Nova is a wonderful book
for the detail it has presented on a very different society than ours,
yet descended from it. It\'s one of my favorites of all time. Full of
good ideas for the GM. I liked the instrument Mouse played (and damn if

EMP cannon = EMP projector

(Other examples of cannons that are sans projectile
 would include sonic riot control cannons.  The
 word cannon is used to indicate a device which
 harms what it is pointed at and not the user.)

As to what a \'real\' EMP weapon can do, read this:

On the other hand, if you just want to shoot something

	That\'s the way I usually do it!

"This race is, for lack of a better term, extremely resistant

race with such resistance? BTW, the world that they live on is 
highl radioactive...thus the need...An exoskeleton with

could be serious, since this shielding would be bypassed...Some genetic
level "repairing" process, to help fix the denaturing due to
radiation?..."

	Is the radiation only found in certain parts of the 
	environment, or are the races tissues radioactive as well?
	Shielding will be of no use if the latter is true. Here
	on terra, organisms have DNA repair mechanisms which vary
	in effectiveness. Almost certainly your race will have
	a very powerful such system (perhaps this would require
	significant metabolic energy: high food intake? slower 
	growth?). We members of Homo sapiens generally have two 
	copies of every gene, but we share Terra with some 
	organisms that have one, three, or more. Perhaps having 
	more copies would increase 	the effectiveness of the 
	repair mechanism (it is more likely that at least one 
	copy stays undamaged long enough to be used as a template 
	for repairs). This might make "DNA fingerprinting" easier, 
	or harder...

	But then, DNA is not the only genetic material here on
	Terra (RNA is used in some viruses). Perhaps your race
	relies on a "sturdier" molecule to encode genetic 
	information. Proteins? Polysaccharides? Nylon? I need
	a chemist here.

	If shielding is involved, it might be thicker on the
	side of the race that faces the ground (if that is 
	where the radiation is coming from). It would almost
	certainly be thicker around the gonads, since 
	mutations there might be inherited by progeny, while
	a mutation in a sucker on your tenticle might have 
	only a local effect (or none at all if it is a gene 
	that only influences number of eyes in your mouth).

	To avoid cancers, perhaps your race has an aggressive
	immune system, with an ability to distinguish mutated 
	cells. This may make them highly resistent to infection 
	but prone to alergic reactions and auto-immune diseases.

	If there are "hot spots" of higher than average 
	radiation, perhaps your race has evolved sensory organs
	that allow individuals to avoid such areas. It might be 
	interesting if they can see or feel radiation (perhaps
	only if the intensity is quite high).

	OK, this is getting too long, hope it helps.

	You can\'t play anything at all with just the GURPS Traveller Book, you need

GURPS Lite (download the pdf free at SJG) should get an experienced ref
through with GT.

GURPS Basic is good, but not necessary. Hardback looks nice.

IMO if you own CT/MT/TNE maybe T4 GURPS Space is a waste of..... The only
really useful stuff is the space environment stuff, but a good ref could
improvise. I would recommend Vehicles 2 ed if you like designing your own
stuff.

Aliens 1 is good (the Zho stuff especially, the other minor races feel
weaker than IG\'s Aliens Archive to me).

BTC is a good sourcebook (for normal Trav too).

Star Mercs is an excellent update of the Bk 4 Mercenary and \'Broadsword\'
adventure sourcebooks.

I don\'t especially like the rules system for GURPS (I prefer a task based
one like T4 or MT) but it seems to work okay. But download the pdf and have
a look....

I\'d also recommend getting the hardbacks if you can afford to, and the GT
stuff appears better formatted than the other GURPS material I\'ve bought.

Well, I\'d have prefered the shorter style descriptions of key systems from
the Regency Sourcebook, with a few key systems (Deneb, Vincennes, Mora,
Trin, GlisTen, Rhylanor and Regina) done in a MTJ style. This leaves less
to \'canon\' or pseudo-canon... Not that I\'m knocking Martin and Neil\'s

I have only one problem with the RSB (aside from the art in some cases); a
certain plot device.... ;-)

It\'s the 2300 UTES (armoured in turret) versus TTA (Target Tracking Array,

The plans are quite nice, and specify which stateroom goes for which

the drawback is that the engines as shown are REAL small for Traveller.

The Islands Clusters aren\'t part of the Domain of Deneb; they don\'t belong
to the Imperium at all. The Regency conquered them to prevent their being
used as a jump-off point for Virus, and even then the conquerors weren\'t

One implication of this is that machinery might not corrode very much
_until used_ (at which point the heat generated increases the corrosive
effects).  For instance, the PCs go in search of the fabled Lost
Scoutship "Scurrilous" (said to have survey data on the legendary Planet
of Good Cheap Booze).  Sensor data might indicate that "Scurrilous" is
in reasonably good shape, given the amount of time is has

Not quite true. It makes the _most populous_, not necessarily best.

I live in Canada\'s most populous urban conglomeration. It\'s definately not
the best location in terms of climate, air quality, scenery, natural
resources...

People move here because people already live here. Services exist, markets
exist, and so forth. Many people don\'t like living here, but are here
because that\'s where they could get a job. If they won the lottery they\'d
leave tomorrow.

...been on the ground.  Of course, the only reason that "Scurrilous" is
still halfway intact is that it assumed the ambient temperature (the
power plant shut down when the radiators corroded away) very soon after
landing.  (Not long after that, the pilot assumed the ambient
temperature as well).  Thus, it suffered a brief burst of corrosive
activity, cooled down, and corroded much more slowly afterward.

Imagine the fun when the PCs decide that _their_ vehicles/landing
craft/starship will be similarly resistant to the atmosphere....

I\'ve been saving the designs. Think I got most of them.  Real life is
still intruding (although the nightmares stopped last week, thank God).
Only one more day to go this week, then I\'ll be able to collate stuff.

Could the High Guard folks please contact Craig (and vice versa) to
convert each other\'s design into the different systems?  Then we\'ll have a
few battles to playtest the designs.  Then we can worry about getting me
clean copies of the (revised) designs for the book.

In the meantime, I\'m still open to submissions for the \'colour\' stories
(reminscences from old veterans, and so on).  And we need some articles on
space combat, although maybe these should wait until after the playtesting?

You can, yes (in fact, on waterworlds you have no choice), but it would
mean having an evolution radically different from Earth\'s. According to
GURPS Dinosaurs, the first forms of life arose around 3,600 billion years
ago, and science is doubtful that the air would have been breathable 590
billion years ago (not 300 as I said in a previous posting). I can\'t
remember when life crawled up on land, but it was considerably before that.

Since I am of the opinion that TLs makes the most sense if they are
interpreted as the technology that people can use if they have the
required knowledge[1], that simply means that the definition is at
fault. In the Traveller Universe the concept is _available_ to all
societies that are not interdicted. Just as surgery is _possible_ as
soon as you can make a sharp knife and boil water. (So IMO surgery is
TL 1 and not TL 4).

[1] Note, I don\'t claim that it makes perfect sense; just that it makes more
sense than any other interpretation. I\'m talking about the OTU here. The one
with the hugely different TLs on ajacent planets...

The original system was for determining the best available world in a star
system. It should be biased towards habitable worlds. Especially since it
is for a RPG. IMO worlds with breathable atmospheres have more potential
for fun RPG milieus than other worlds (Not that I don\'t want SOME of the
other kind of worlds. I just want more lifebearing ones).

Oh, I don\'t think the Traveller world generation system is perfect (though
my main beef is with the recently-mentioned total lack of correlation
between habitability and population). However, if a more realistic system
means reams of worlds where people are forced to live highly restricted
lives supported by complex technological support structures, and a dearth
of garden worlds where neo-barbarians can survive and form pre-industrial
societies herding their rhinoxes across the Sea of Grass under the green
sky, then spare me that more realistic system. I\'m all for realism, but
only up to the point where it begins to interfere with game enjoyment.

In short, having only one or two mainworlds with exotic atmospheres out of
every 10 or 20 with breathable atmospheres is fine by be, however
unrealistic it may be.

Yes, that most worlds in a RPG universe are full of fun places to have
adventures.

More accurately, the sum of the infinite series is a finite number (it is, in
fact, 1).  Since each step _takes_ half as long, as well as being half as long,
you can do an infinite number of steps in finite time.

By happy coincidence, someone left a copy of the Dec \'98 issue of *Popular

Best of What\'s New: 100 of the Year\'s Greatest Achievements in Science &
Technology," we find:

   "Super Gun    Perhaps the most lethal rifle ever developed, the
Objective Individual Combat Weapon from Alliant TechSystems fires a 5.56mm
NATO bullet as well as a 20mm exploding round that can be timed to detonate
above, behind, or in front of a target.  A computerized laser rangefinder
determines the distance to the target.  The range is about 1,000 meters.
An infrared night vision and 6X zoom video camera connect to a head-mounted
display, effectively enabling a soldier to shoot around corners."

With two pictures - it\'s an over-and-under, with the 20mm barrel on top,
fed by a magazine behind the pistol grip (bullpup-style), and the 5.56mm
barrel fed by a clip in the normal position in front of the trigger guard.

And BtC have background radiation as an atmospheric taint. DGP made some

I won\'t dispute your main point, because that\'s a matter of opinion, but just

Nope.  You should mail me so I can look into it.  We have been messing

Offhand?  No idea, though the dissolved oxygen content in water is sufficient
for an artificial gill and isn\'t very high.  Also depends on your technology. 
At TL 10 I suspect the limit would be a few percent of standard atmospheric
pressure.

Shrug.  Radioactive dust _is_ an atmospheric taint, best handled with a filter
mask.  Of course, the idea that a world which is still inhabited would have
enough fallout in major areas to be a danger to breathe for periods of less
than _years_ is pretty unlikely.

I know the ancients weren\'t early droyne.  Terraforming doesn\'t require the
ancients per se, though they could have done it too.

Yah, unless the world is _really_ small.  Most of the problem worlds aren\'t
really any worse than mars, which would probably be around TL 9 to terraform. 
I suppose it would be higher tech for the Vilani, terraforming is highly
dependent on biotechnology.

station.

Even worse than I thought.  BTW, I assumed that the EMS emissions could be

Yeah, i think i\'d agree w/ that completely.  The one thing i don\'t like with
those smaller descriptions is that sometimes, there\'s only mention of what\'s
happened hundreds of years previous to the "current date" (whatever that is).
I find this in both books, actually.  References to the world did from the
Third Frontier War (even Fifth for the RSB) are just ancient history... If
nothings happened there "officially" in the last century, at least, i don\'t
think it rates a paragraph description.  Leave it for individual campaigns.

But ultimately the GM is still in control of the character.  The player
might try to quit by saying, "My character shoots himself in the head," and
the "god" (read "GM") can say, "Oops!  Your weapon jams and Lt. Kelly grabs
it out of your hand, slaps you upside o\' the head, and says, \'Whatteryu
thinkin\', bowaaah?\'" or the "god" can say, "Oops, you didn\'t shoot yourself
in the RIGHT part of the head, so now you\'re a vegetable.  I\'ll play your
character from here."

The player is powerless to affect the "god" \'s universe unless the "god" so
allows it.

P.S.:  The only reason they don\'t call "GM" \'s "god" is to keep from
offending the religious.  In AD&D the DM often plays the role of the gods,
so how can you say he/she IS NOT "god"?  The only PC\'s who play "gods" are
in Monty Haul campaigns and are usually only able to affect the universe in
a finite way.

As I said, this was only changes that affected the map itself.  It didn\'t
include the 15 worlds that changed sizes (including two that went to size B
& C), the 46 Tech Level changes, or the 45 other worlds with major
population changes that weren\'t explained.

It\'s in Supplement 7, \'Traders & Gunboats\'.  I\'d scan them in for you, but my 
Windows side got whacked when I hadda reinstall Linux, and my scanner is a 
Win-only jobbie.

Woosy IBM machines.  Give me 72 Sun E10k cabs with 14 Sun IO cabs (same
total of 86) and I\'ll give you 4630 400MHz processors (twice as fast so I
only need to use half as many cpus, plus those will come with 8megs of
cache on each CPU), 4608 gigabytes of RAM, and 14.1 terabytes of disk
storage.  Of course, I can\'t bring that up as one domain yet, the best I
think Sun can do is 5 domains (using SCI and software to cluster\'em
together).  If you check out any benchmarking on IBM versus Sun, you\'ll see
Sun\'s high end is twice as fast as the nearest competitor\'s and uses less
CPUs to boot.

OTOH, one could argue that, if most worlds rate only one paragraph, that
paragraph should be weighted in favor of events most associated with
that world, regardless of how far in the past those events were.  Often,
that means the last major battle fought in the vicinity.

Let\'s face it.  If you mention the following places to most people
(other than those who are from these places, or near them), the most
common recognition (assuming that the people in question recognize the
place at all) will be along the lines of, "Wasn\'t there a battle fought
there in [fill-in-the-blank] War?"

Lexington & Concord
Ypres
Gettysburg
Balaclava
Guadalcanal
The A-Shau Valley
Goose Green
Port Arthur
Nijmegen
Vera Cruz
Sedan
Waterloo

Of the places mentioned above, nearly half were battlefields over 100
years ago, and none has seen open combat more recently than fifteen
years ago.  Surely the battles associated with these places rate more
mention than more recent, more uneventful happenings.

Radioactive dust, yes (Though I would prefer a protective suit to prevent the

can find a way to make a filter mask help out there, I will be _really_
amazed. ;-)

I suppose I shouldn\'t be dogmatic about it, but my impression is that the

You\'re talking about providing a complete atmosphere wholesale, not just
("just"!) freeing bound oxygen into an already existing atmosphere.
 
Perhaps we use the concept of TL differently. When I think of large-scale
terraforming being of a certain TL, I don\'t think of it as \'barely feasable\'
but as \'commercially sound\'. That means its cost and expected return is
low enough and fast enough to attract investments.

Canonically such terraforming is TL 12 or 13 (I forget), but the TL tables
in Referee\'s Companion have other mistakes, so I won\'t base my case on that.

I don\'t think a player would quit by saying "my guy shoots himself in

"this is stupid, I\'m leaving".  Who cares if the GM is still in control

So if I play the role of a god in a play or a movie does that make me a

delusions of grandeur.  The GM is much closer to a director, referee,

he will lose (or not find) some players because of it.  At the very

Coach.  I\'m just the coach.  I come up with the plays, schedule the
games, assign positions and even cut players sometimes.  But I want to
see my players have fun and win a few.  I don\'t write the rules.  I
let the dice or odds be referees.  I am there on approval.  If my
players "win" more often than not, I\'m a good coach.  If my plays OR
my team fall apart then I\'m going to get sacked.  Anything else IS a
delusion.

  I kind of liked the idea of doing something like the Aftermath! suggestion
of setting a campaign post-Martian Conquest (tripods, heat rays, black smoke,
& all), except using a (small, initially) Vilani response from an unusually
pro-active sector governor. 

  The fact that I was reading GURPS: Atomic Horror at the time may have
influenced me in this respect.

Once again, Hollyweird got it wrong.  You affect people with an EMP by

Trust me, 90% of the time when Hollywood mentions something of an advanced

You mean "million" not billion. 

And Gurps Dinosaurs states quite clearly that land dwelling life didn\'t
evolve until *after* the year round atmosphere. 

Here we are (numbers are millions of years ago)

4,600  earth forms and begins to cool
3,800  first life on earth
1,200  Earth develops year-round oxygen atmosphere and ozone layer
  590  Cambrain period (text suggests that atmosphere should be breathable)
  505  First land plants
  408  Devonian period First spiders and wingless insects
  370  first amphibians.

So the air is breathable 85 million years before there are land plants.
And 182 million before we have as much as *insects* on land. It\'s a
full 220 million years from breathable until we get amphibians. 

Remember. Land animals need breathable air too! :-)

So "normal" evolution will do the trick just fine. 

Hmmm. Let\'s redo that timeline a bit:

4,600  planet is molten, atmosphere CH4, NH3, H2O, SO2, etc
3,800  planet is solid, atmosphere is CO2, N2, some SO2
1,200  atmosphere has O2 year round, ("thin"[1], tainted)
  590  standard

[1] the O2 content is low enough to require a compressor, but the
actual *pressure* is normal

So for about 1/3 of the time that the atmosphere has been breathable,
there\'s been no land life. And the atmosphere has only been breathable
for about 1/8th of the planet\'s history. 

BTW, it\'s quite likely that the shift from CH4/NH3 to CO2/N2 occured
before life started, but it\'s not certain, so I just left it there.

Well, the version I read about was intended for aiming something to
stop the sniper. Say a boosted grenade?

Sniper fires at troops, sensor triggers launcher that drops a grenade
in sniper\'s lap. Boom!

Once they get this working ok, snipers will have the same problem
modern artillery has. Effective (and damn near *immediate)
counterbattery fire. 

Sniping becomes a whole different game when all it takes is *one* shot
for them to pinpoint you.

Alas, the better the genetic repair mechanism, the slower the rate at

Longitude is *inherently* arbitrary with one exception. Worlds that have
one face "tidally locked" (like we used to think Mercury did) have an
obvious zero meridian. The center of "day side".

Over millions, you *can\'t* keep the co-ordinate system. On many worlds
the continents will move noticeably in that much time.

Remember that the zero meridian determines the local time base as well
as setting up the navigational grid. So it\'s a damn good idea to place
it so that timezones and especially the "date line" (at the 180
meridian) fall in the most practical way. It\'s a pain when you have a
settlement or installation where the time (or worse yet, *date*) differ
from one side to the other!

If the world has a substantial hydro percentage, or otherwise has a
marked asymmettry in the easily habitable areas, you place the zero
meridian so that 180 meridian (and hence the "dateline") will pass thru
areas that aren\'t likely to be inhabited. This avoids a lot of problems
later.

If the planet is already inhabited, you use the zero meridian the
natives use, or if they aren\'t that advanced, you may run it thru the
capital of the group you make contact with. If they are really low
tech, just go back the first method.

And if the rotational period is *really* long, or the surface isn\'t
likely to be habitable, you just fall back to picking a prominent
geographical feature.

Nope. A lot depends on things like the "ionic radius" of the atom, and
the crystal structure of the metal. The heavier elements tend to have
bigger electron shells, thus decreasing the density. Though perhaps not
*quite* as fast as the atomic weight goes up. 

It\'ll probably be dense. But I\'d be *really* surprised if there\'s *any*
substance made of *atoms* that\'s as much as *three* times as dense as
gold. 

One way to have them discover it would be if they had an x-ray type
device for examining luggage and small containers for booby traps. It
might be just for that purpose, or it might be a tool normally used to
check for defects in large chunks of metal (like the hull, or parts of
the drive).

X-raying the stuff should produce interesting effects. At the verey
least, it\'ll be *very* opaque to xrays. If it\'s an actual *crystal* of
the metal (as opposed to just a random chunk, which would consist of
lots of different crystals, randomly aligned) then you might get
diffraction effects as the beam tries to pass between the layers of
atoms in the crystal. This would result in an odd semi-geometric
pattern on light and dark areas on the image. And the pattern would
change as you rotated the crystal with respect to the beam (say by
"shooting pictures" from different angles).

Well, again, rail guns are superior. The magentic field is not only
constant, it\'s mostly confined between the plates "above" and "below"
the rails. 

You\'ll get a small blip of static as the needle makes the initial
contact with the rails, and as it breaks contact at the end of the
barrel.

Either there are two such projects, or they got it wrong on TV. The
project uses millimeter wave radar to track the projectiles.

I was picturing the idiot in his "invisible" ship trying to sneak in to
land on a planet and getting nailed because orbital sensors notice this
"hole" between them and the planet. :-)

I thought that one up a few years back during an early debate about
"stealth". It\'s only useful if you are somewhere that an "unknown"
object that large isn\'t suspcious in and of itself. So the usefulness
is kinda limited.

On the other hand, given decent sensors, a *common* activity will be
sending in one or more "recon" ships to enemy systems. They\'ll pop in
at a somewhat random location, probably a fair ways above or below the
plane of the system. Then they\'ll deploy a *big* folding array, and
record whatever they can pick up on passive. They can try for some
active sweeps as well, but there\'s really no point.

It\'ll be *minutes* before their exit flash reaches anybody in the plane
of the system. So unless ships are operating in full stealth all the
time, they are going to catch some. And it\'ll take *hours* to get a
ship to their position unless you can afford to disperse a truly
astronomical number of pickets around the system. 

So they can observe stuff for at least hours, maybe even days, then
jump out again. And the defender of the system can\'t do a damn thing
about it. After all, while you can do a good job of *detecting* a ship
at a couple of AU, you can\'t *hit* it with anything.

And if you try to close on it, you\'ll have to do so at greatly reduced
power, and they may *still* jump before you get in range.

I figure the recon missions will be even *more* annoying than U-2 and
SR-71 flights were to the USSR. :-)

Don\'t forget that there are two (count \'em) Traveller RPG games on computer
now from ages past;  I recently had the opportunity to play Megatraveller
I: The Zhodani Conspiracy again and found it quite entertaining for a few
hours.

Megatraveller I and II have been released on a single CD and are sometimes
found in the "cheapie" section.

In addition, I played a game of the same era called "Sentinel Worlds" which
was very traveller in feel and was similarly entertaining.

You know, I have used the expression "god" (little g) for years as a 
game master. I\'ve never had a player get upset about it, and I have 
NEVER asked for offerings, sacrifices, or worship.
The acronym:
(g)ame
(o)perations
(d)irector
has always been a joke to my group of friends.
The phrase "god" has always been used to signify the ability the referee 
has to make any changes in the world/universe as needed.

People have been using phrases like DungeonMaster, GameMaster, Referee, 
and many others for years as well.

The best thing to remember as a game master is that you are a "HOST". 
People are visiting your little world/universe you have created. Be 
courteous and let them know up front what major differences they can 
expect from the published canon. Make them feel welcome, throw them 
challenges, puzzles, and action spiced with humor and tragedy and they 
will keep coming back for more.

The fact is, the Game Master is in effect a demi-god, having the power 
to crush the characters in an instant if he chooses. The difference 
between a good one and a bad one is that the players don\'t return to bad 
ones...

The concept that I got from this discussion is of some non-Vilani, non-RoM
"Johnny Appleseed" organization/planet/entrepreneur/culture that knows,
someday, they\'re going to need these planets.

Read "Red Mars" by Kim Stanley Robinson.  The technology used to terraform
Mars in that book is TL6 or less; windmill heaters, black dust on the ice
caps, large scale drilling ops (for water) - except the manufacturing,
which is turning the raw materials of the surface directly into
manufactured goods in many cases (self replicating robots are probably at
least TL8-9), and the biotechnology, which is not much more than TL8.  In
general though, I would say that large scale terraforming is possible at
TL8, just really slow.

That firearms are possible at TL 3 does not make them likely or practical.
The time scale involved in TL8 Terraforming makes it economically
completely ridiculous, and it would take a major government/organization
that had the long view to the point of hyperbole to make this idea work.
On the other hand, it would only take one TL9-10 government in range
(barely) of the Spinward Main that had a few years of Extreme Prosperity to
be able to mount a survey and terraforming expedition.

The remains of that culture, after the civil war that followed a few
decades later, can be found at hex XXYY.   Look out, the surface is still
hot.

A relatively small, premade "drop" package could be sent to Mars on the
next train that could begin some of these measures now, assuming that we
won\'t need the planet to be atmosphered for another 200-300 years.  Similar
measures may have been undertaken to provide the prosperous appleseedians
with homes for future generations (remember the population growth scares of
the 70s and 80s?  They finally took that little box away at the Museum of
Science in Boston that showed how many square feet each person would get in
2020).

So, what would be left of the package after 10,000 years?  How about their
Scout Ships?  maybe they used sublight interstellar methods i.e. cold
sleep?

I see the seeds of an adventure here.

I thought that the weapon in Eraser was a Gauss rifle.

Okay, it was actually a special effect that seemed to break conservation
of momentum and couldn\'t decide if the effect was supposed to be a
4mm hypervelocity round or 40mm HE. ;-)

In any case, the sniper sight was far more impressive.

I also thought that the monies involved were several noughts short of
a sound business case: sell a thousand illegally for $100million
or millions legally for $several billion - I can see a difficult
choice here :-)

    'body' => 'Friends,

The following is my opinion, and may or may not reflect the opinions 
of others on this list.  My comments are not meant to upset or 
provoke anyone, but simply include my thoughts on quality GMing 
philosophy in the recent discussion.  I apologize in advance to 
anyone who may take offense at my words.  Now, that having been said, 
I can move on to the topic at hand.

Like many of us, I have gamed with a wide number of GMs and GM 
styles, and have developed a sense of GMing based on those 
experiences.  Typically, there seems to be two types of GMs:  those 
that allow PC influence on the world, and those who don\'t.

Among those who do not allow PC influence on the world, I\'ve seen a
wide number who portray and actively support the "GM is God" gaming
philosophy.  I\'ve even seen a GM who created his own screen with the
words "Game Operations Director" plastered heavily on it, the first
letter of each in bold print.  These GMs tend to be very aggresive,
proactive and control oriented, and seemingly hate to have anyone
change their storylines or milieu settings (unless the PCs\' actions
coincide with what the GM wants to happen.)  While some of these GMs
run very good games, a majority of them do not.  They apparently run
a game for whatever psychological benefits they attain from
controlling and/or frustrating others.

(Mind you, frustrating your players is part of being a good GM, in my 
opinion.  Allowing them to resolve those frustrations at some point 
in the game is another, equally important part of being a good GM.)

On the other hand, there are those GMs that allow the players to 
influence the game\'s outcome, and the milieu.  Most of these GMs 
support a more congenial, reactive GMing style referred to on this 
list as the "GM as CEO" style.  I prefer to game with this type of 
GM, myself, as I, the player, feel like I have the capacity to change 
the world (if even a little bit), and to accomplish something I\'ve 
set out to do.  A good GM will rarely let the goal be completed ad 
hoc, but will often throw in some good twists, which gives the 
impetus for further adventuring.  The down side to some who GM this 
way is that during their initial maturation as a GM, they tend to 
give their players everything, and soon you\'re in a Monty Haul 
campaign (to borrow a term from another system.)

In order to run a quality game, _every_ GM should remember that the 
players do not have to game, either with him or at all.  Ultimately, 
it is the players\' motivations and priorities that determine whether 
the player is going to enjoy spending a weekend afternoon with his 
gaming buddies, working out, or spending time with a significant 
other.  The player casts his vote on the quality of the game every 
time they show up to play.  If a GM doesn\'t run a quality game, his 
players leave, for whatever the official reason.  If the GM runs a 
quality game , his players stay, and they sometimes even bring other 
players to join the campaign.  

And if a player leaves the group, a sore GM can do whatever they want 
to the character, that doesn\'t change the fact that, in the player\'s 
eye, the GM didn\'t run a quality game.  At that point, the GM should 
consider what it was that made the player leave, and determine if the 
reasons for the player leaving is going to cause others to leave.  
And if it\'s something the GM can address, then there is room for 
improvement...

All in all, IMHO, a good GM serves a variety of roles.  He is a 
storyteller, in that he presents the milieu and its many varied 
inhabitants to his players in an entertaining manner.  He is an 
arbitrator, for his is the final decision on rules interpretations 
and scenario management.  He is an organizer, in that he keeps and 
presents the information produced for and by the players.  He is a 
entertainer, for the fun of gaming is one of my ultimate reasons for 
RPGing.  He is an adversary, but only from the viewpoint of 
realistically portraying enemy tactics in specific situations.  And 
ultimately, he is a Master of the Game (the session, not his 
players), for he fulfills these roles to the best of his ability, 
demonstrating his aptitude for handling the gaming session, the 
milieu and the players\' enjoyment while still having a good time 
himself.

I think the best piece of advice I\'ve ever heard from a gamer, GM or 
PC, is: "Remember, no matter how much fun you\'re having or how much 
crap you\'re putting up with, one thing remains constant:  in the long
run, it\'s just a piece of paper.  So let it go and just have fun!"

Thank you for your time.  I now return you to your regularly
scheduled thread, already in progress...

In Service,

Start with rate:

Psionics-0. There is no psionics! (er... well, I never use Zhodani, 
don\'t believe in Grandfather, and the Droyne aren\'t around).

	Used to be like this IMTU.

Psionics-1. Yeah, OK, there is a thing called psionics, but neither 
the characters have the slightest idea what it is about, nor is 
playing any relevant role in the campaign.

	This is my rating now ;-)

The authors misspelled the name of my hometown. A river that created
settlements from New York state to Chesapeake Bay was missing
(probably because it didn\'t go to New York harbor, or wasn\'t involved with
the Erie Canal). Look at my state\'s pages, and you think that there\'s a big
city at one end, some waterfalls at the other, and wilderness in between.

Now, I realize that they had to edit for brevity...but I think they covered
the knowledge most people would have of my state if they\'ve never
been to it. And they missed a world full of things.

Locations of some of the most famous sites of the revolutionary war.
Almost the entire combat zone of the French & Indian War (at least
on what is now US soil). The US Military Academy. The most famous 
glassmaking facilities on the continent. An entire maritime region that\'s 
almost as classic as the midatlantic coast. How was it decided what
would get a picture or a sentence, and what would not?

ObTrav: Take a look at the paragraph a world gets in a detailed subsector
description. Imagine what they missed. Does Regina have a significant
expatriot Aslan community? Is Vilis the spiritual home for the
Benlau Rheim school of literature? These paragraphs are a combination
of what a travel writer found interesting and what an editor thought

we decided on was that anything that might cause problems if you walked out
the airlock and started breathing the local air would qualify as a taint.

"Allergic reactions to local pollen kill 10% of visitors" through "it really

true. But with so many worlds in the Marches having "tainted" atmospheres,
we ended up taking a rather loose interpreatation of "tainted" in order to
avoid yet another "toxic dust" or "allergenic pollen" listing.

Presumably, you mean "DGP".

I haven\'t seen a response to this, so I\'ll speak from the depths of my
ignorance.

To the very best of my knowledge and travels round the internet etc., I\'ve
never heard that this was published.

I think I recall hearing somewhere that it may have got as far as a
manuscript but was never published.  In which case Roger Sanger would be
the man to contact about getting it published as he bought the rights to
the DGP material.

Hope this helps

No world is a perfect sphere (if it is, that\'s an adventure hook in
itself). Variations in the shape (actually, the gravitational potential
field, which isn\'t necessarily the same thing) are mapped using geodesy,
from the errors they introduce into a nominal ("perfect") orbit. This is a
powerful technique even at our tech level, and likely to be a standard part
of any survey.

The results are expressed in the form of spherical harmonics, using Fourier
transforms to break a complex pattern into a series of overlaid simpler
waveforms. Some of these waveforms are longitudinally-based (I can\'t
remember offhand whether those are the sine terms, the cosine terms, or one
of the cross-terms). Pick the longitude line that is the mathematical
minimum of the first (largest) longitudinal term, and call it the "survey
meridian". 

This has the additional advantage, at least on Earth-like worlds, that
since the oceans have the thinnest crust, and thus the greatest
gravitational potential (for absolute height above the Earth\'s center), the
survey meridian falls opposite the emptiest part of the largest ocean. On
Earth, this is the middle of the Pacific Ocean -- near the International
Date Line -- and thus the survey meridian falls very close to Greenwich.

The survey meridian and the calculations that support it will be stable
over geologic time, and so pretty good for historical purposes. As Leonard
notes, the planet itself isn\'t all that stable on the order of millions of
years.

Thus the "survey meridian" only lasts until someone who lives there defines
a more convenient zero. With computerized navaids, this is probably just a
matter of setting the "offset from survey meridian" variable in your
handheld GPS or inertial compass.

On colony worlds, I normally place the zero meridian on the site of the
first colony, which usually has the main starport and grows into the
capital. This is normally the center of colonization for most of the
planet\'s early history, and so it will be a while before anyone gets around
to settling near the dateline on the opposite side. Even then, the old,
established interests will dominate. Sometimes the capital and/or starport
move later, but then meridian stays.

How about coming up with a classification system not based on the outdated

In designing the UTUP profile, I forget entirely about the whole 
Psionics thing, so I would recommend including it as a skill, with a 
number rating how far you\'ve diverged from canon.  That\'s what the 
skill section is for, to cover this type of thing.

A second solution would be to introduce a seventh stat, separated 
from the first six by a hyphen, followed by a number ranking the 
overall importance of psionics in YTU, similar to some of the other 
UTUP statistics.

Hope this helps,

When they are in a superior social position, yes.  The point I was making is
that you can worship, ANYTHING.  You can worship rocks, idols of wood,
trees, animals, people, or invisible "gods".  This broad usage of the word
"worship" is backed up in an obscure work like the Bible.  ; )

Exactly!  Which means the CHARACTER(it being the more IMPORTANT element than
the player in this debate) would then be in the total control (really, it
always was...) of the GM, the "god" of the universe.

>  More than likely, if they said anything, they would say
>"this is stupid, I\'m leaving".

And they would cease to have any role in their character\'s development IN
THAT UNIVERSE, showing how powerless the player is, compared to the GM/
"god"/"mighty one".

Incidentally, that is what the word "god" means in its original Canaanite
language.  "El" (of "Elohim" fame) means "mighty one".  In the Old
Testament, since the word continued to be used in Hebrew, a derivative of
Canaanite/Phoenician, "elohim" is also used to refer to humans who are
"judges" and even "angels".  So really, the etymology of the word proves
that, YES, a GM *is* "god" of the campaign he/she is running.

>  Who cares if the GM is still in control
>of the character.

Those still in the universe do.  The GM, who is trying to maintain the
"order" of his created "scheme of things" (a little play on words, there),
of his Cosmos/World/Universe/Olam, cares.

The debate isn\'t about whether you care, but about whether the GM is in the
position of "god" in his universe.  The answer is "yes."  The PC is
powerless to alter anything about the universe unless the GM/god so allows
it.

How anyone can fail to see the parallel is beyond me.  The analogy of the
Ref being "god" has been used in RPG\'s since pre-D&D.  Only some PC(in this
case, politically-correct) newbie Ref (referring to the guy who wrote that
article that was quoted) would challenge such a fundamental description of
the role of the GM.

>   Anyone can create their own little universe to play
>by themselves and call themselves "God" or whatever.

But then that would be ANOTHER universe and being a "god" in THAT universe
would not give you the ability to AFFECT the first "god" \'s universe.  Even
if you were such a grand Traveller "god" that you could change something
about the canonical rules, that doesn\'t mean that the "god" running a
universe has to incorporate those changes into his universe.

>  It is usually called dementia when adults do it.

And adults who are avid gamers are usually referred to as "geeks".  What\'s
your point?  Are we cracking on ourselves, now?

Isn\'t author of a sci-fi novel the "god" of that universe?  How can ANYONE
not see the parallel?

I\'m not saying that you are a TRUE "god" in the REAL WORLD.  C\'mon, do you
really think I\'ve been asserting that?  I\'m only saying what has been said
all along with RPG\'s.  The GM is the god in the universe he/she creates.
The fact that players pander to a GM\'s needs in an effort to petition favor
and blessings upon their characters shows that the GM is "god" in the
universe in which the player\'s character finds itself.

I think that would be nipped in the bud as soon as the geek tried to invite
some swimsuit model to join in on a game.  Get real.

>and producer.

Wrong.  All of these people have to kiss somebody\'s ass, in the long run.  A
GM doesn\'t have to kiss anybody\'s ass in his universe.  Now in real life,
that\'s a different story.

>  If the GM has delusions of being a god, more than likely
>he will lose (or not find) some players because of it.

Pure crap.  I go into a game assuming that the Ref is playing the role of
"god."  All of my players have always assumed that.  It is ASSUMED, so no
big deal is made about it.  Sure, some dork can have sparks fly out of his
ears and climb onto the top of an Army barracks and yell, "I am god," but he
will soon have a reality check coming his way.

>  At the very
>least a GM that controls the actions of the players\' characters will
>tick off a number of players.

It is done secretly (and even overtly) all of the time when a GM decides he
doesn\'t like the outcome of a die roll...  As long as the "overruling" is
beneficial to the character, the player doesn\'t complain.  Secondly, a
ticked off player doesn\'t control his character, anymore, as soon as he
walks away from the universe. SHOWING that the GM is "god" of that universe.
As respects the fictional world of the "god" \'s universe, players are
expendable(since any player can play the character later, and a GM can take
up the role as an NPC meanwhile), but as respects a real life role-playing
game session, you NEED at least one player; otherwise, it is like writing
fiction (somewhat MPD) and not far from creative auto-sexuality.

Gamers wouldn\'t care one way or the other whether the GM was called "god" or
not.  In Army training, the O.C.\'s (observer controller----geee... sounds
like a description of an all-seeing, all-powerful "god") carries a "GOD
gun".  Soldiers who frequently use the word "c-nt" when running in
formation, all to the education of kiddies on their way to school, don\'t
take offense to a big ass laser projector being called a "god gun".  The
"god gun" is used to blast a soldier or vehicle off the map with a powerful
laser beam if the Ref ("god") decides("overrules"--I\'ll say it, again--"OVER
rules") that the soldier/vehicle has put itself at ridiculous risk, whether
or not it was tagged by another soldier or vehicle\'s laser emitter according
to the rules.

The reason the GM isn\'t called "God" is for the same reason that you don\'t
find "Jehovah" [sic] in the Dieties and Demi-gods manual for AD&D.  Because
it would piss off some Christians!  In fact, Jehovah\'s Witnesses just won\'t
let AD&D win, putting the designers down for not including "Jehovah" in that
book, but if Gary Gygax HAD put "Jehovah" in that book, the J.W.\'s would
have freaked out about a man playing "Jehovah"!  Gamers are damned if they
do, damned if they don\'t when touching the taboo topic of "god" or
"Jehovah".

That\'s why GM\'s are referred to as the "god" of the campaign only to those
who are being initiated.

"Black Duke" was never printed, but I have a copy of the outline that I

You are HOST of a game in THE REAL WORLD.

More precisely, players are participating in your game.  CHARACTERS are in
the little world/universe.

"Delusions" would be thinking you were actually existing in that universe,
though this is the effect we strive for as good GM\'s, isn\'t it?

>

Demi-god only in that he/she is "god" in the universe, itself, and an
ordinary (?) human just like the players in the REAL WORLD.  Being able to
crush a personality out of existence would be the sign of a full "god",
also.  No need to demote him/her to "demi-god", unless you can show some
limitation of power that restrains the GM in his universe (I can\'t think of
one).  Again, a distinction between the universe and the real world must be
made.  I have, from the beginning, been speaking about the power of the GM
in his universe, though I did make mention of the fact that players give
unsolicited offerings (just like many religious "cheerful givers") to the
person of the GM in REAL LIFE so that 1) a game will go on --and-- 2)  the
characters might be blessed by the GM in HIS UNIVERSE.  No one can argue
that a GM is "god" in his universe when a character PRAYS to the "god" being
played by the GM and the GM responds verbally in the role of that "god".

True, and a GM can assume the role of "god" and be a very good GM, just like
many of mine have been, UNDER the assumption that they were "god" of their
universe.

Take a rethink at what constitutes "winning" in a role-playing game.
This isn\'t a game like football, checkers or chess - there isn\'t a game-
defined goal that means victory for your team, defeat for the other side.

In a role-playing game, you either "win" by having fun, or you lose by
not having fun. 

If a GM sees his players as opposition to be beaten, he won\'t keep
any players long if they know what they\'re missing. A GM can "win"
whenever he chooses, simply by bringing on the bad guys until the
good guys drop. 

Now, the "Coach" analogy...the GM is trying to make sure he and the
players all win by having fun. The "opposition" are a bunch of numbers
on a piece of paper - the opposition can\'t have any fun.

It\'s part of the fun. The GM has to balance the opposition against what
makes sense (to aid suspension of disbelief) and what makes things
interesting. 

I\'ve seen players go through defeats, pyrrhic victories and even deaths
while having the time of their lives...Carter Blackmoor (in my Justice, Inc.
pulps campaign) lost his life facing down an ultimate evil, and the player
saw it as a climactic end to a career of adventure. 

(The bit where Carter looked down from above afterwards, wondering what 
came next...and a polite gentleman in a white suit came up and said, "Hello 
Mr. Blackmoor. We\'ve been quite impressed with your investigations. Would 
you be interested in taking a few cases for us?"  Carter thought for a
moment, and asked, "Would I get wings?"  "We\'ll talk about it..." ...as
Carter and his new associate walked off through gathering clouds of white..
OK, we were in a 30\'s cinematic adventure campaign at the time, it seemed
appropriate. (:  )

A GM can advocate his NPC\'s and his universe all day long, and it

The story and the player interaction are more important than anything

I just wanted to add some things...


>Typically, there seems to be two types of GMs:  those
that allow PC influence on the world, and those who don\'t.

No happy mediums?

First, how you view a "god" comes into play...  Do you believe that a "god"
can be benevolent AND stern?

Second, a good GM allows players to "REALISTICALLY" effect change in his
universe.  A Zero Level Forest Gump just MIGHT be able to make a small
change for the better in his world.  A Duchess might be able to effect
significant changes in her domain, at least until she dies.

And that is another point, life in an RPG shouldn\'t be all that different
from life in the real world.  As long as some form of immortality isn\'t
bestowed upon the PC, they should eventually see the signs of aging in their
skin, hair, weight, and should feel the urgency of making a mark in the
universe in which he lives.  Most people will be forgotten as the sands of
history cover them up.  Some people will be fortunate enough to become a
footnote in a classical work.  Others will take up a whole paragraph in a
history book.  In the long run, most of us affect the world we live in
insignificantly.  But while the PC still has breath and a pistol in his
hands or knowledge in his mind, the potential is there.  A good "god"
doesn\'t deny this, but he doesn\'t make a character Emperor of the Imperium
just so that they can be in a position to effect real change that soon will
become another page in history, too.

If "true to life", a PC\'s goals will become our goals and the same goals had
by all of the ancients.  "Get the things we want."  Have a home, find the
mate of our dreams(or, at least, one we will settle for), live in peace,
make children, age gracefully.  Most adventurers are of the "Rage, rage,
against the dying of the light" school and see little satisfaction in a
normal life, but that is because players don\'t immerse themselves in the
offered world and consider the consequences of the decisions before them.
Happiness can be right under a character\'s nose while they are thinking it
is to be had at the next world.  It would be refreshing if some PC would
respond like Han Solo under Jabba\'s gun, saying, in effect, "Going after the
death star is madness" and thinking, "If I don\'t pay Jabba back, soon, my
ass is grass."  True, he came back to help, but when had this smuggler ever
been so on top of the game?  The Death Star, Princess Leia, a whiny boy, a
couple of droids, a crazy old fool, and a dude in black armour had all of a
sudden made his life significant.

That "Star Wars" story I read on here was appreciated.  For once, the
StormTroopers were presented as the trained troops they would be, not the
"can\'t hit the side of a barn" greenies that the movies make them out to be.
The United States Army might be incompetent, but given the same mission,
your average civilian would be even MORE incompetent.

I\'ve wondered if players shouldn\'t put an admission fee into the pot, along
with the GM\'s reward, all as a deterrent, so that players will FEEL the
pain.  All players who survive to the end of the adventure would get a cut
of the pot.  Maybe then players wouldn\'t go sauntering into a hail of
fireflies as if it was Disney World.


>On the other hand, there are those GMs that allow the players to
influence the game\'s outcome, and the milieu.  Most of these GMs
support a more congenial, reactive GMing style referred to on this
list as the "GM as CEO" style.  I prefer to game with this type of
GM, myself, as I, the player, feel like I have the capacity to change
the world (if even a little bit), and to accomplish something I\'ve
set out to do.

A good "god" GM will permit this, also.  A good "god" GM would be a mixture
of the deist ("I\'ve created the world, now I\'ll walk away and leave it be")
god and the all-powerful, present-everywhere, all-seeing god.  Homer seemed
to have the formula down, except for the oft appearances of these "gods",
which wouldn\'t fit well in a sci-fi campaign.

>And if a player leaves the group, a sore GM can do whatever they want
to the character, that doesn\'t change the fact that, in the player\'s
eye, the GM didn\'t run a quality game.

True, but it still stands that the GM is "god" in that universe.  It
recently happened to me.  The DM who boasted about this all-important "epic
quest" killed us, all 6 characters, off TWICE.  He did it a 3rd time AFTER I
quit.  Still, I never denied that he was "god" in his epic quest\'s universe.


>All in all, IMHO, a good GM serves a variety of roles.  He is a
storyteller,

It is said of the Judeo-Christian creator that he inspired the Bible, which
contains many stories.

> in that he presents the milieu and its many varied
inhabitants to his players in an entertaining manner.  He is an
arbitrator, for his is the final decision on rules interpretations
and scenario management.

The Judeo-Christian creator is called a Law-giver.

>  He is an organizer, in that he keeps and
presents the information produced for and by the players.

He is thought to keep the universe in order, since He is said to have
created it.

>  He is a
entertainer, for the fun of gaming is one of my ultimate reasons for
RPGing.

Animals can be very entertaining.  If you\'re an optimist, life can be
entertaining.  If you have a dark sense of humour, observing the human race
can be entertaining.  All these things are said to originate with the
Judeo-Christian creator.

>  He is an adversary, but only from the viewpoint of
realistically portraying enemy tactics in specific situations.

"Satan" is said to originate from the Judeo-Christian creator and the
"fallen state" of man is the result of a curse pronounced by the same
creator.  Israel, the race, is said to "wrestle with god".  Isra EL
(EL="god"/"mighty one").

>  And
ultimately, he is a Master of the Game (the session, not his
players), for he fulfills these roles to the best of his ability,
demonstrating his aptitude for handling the gaming session, the
milieu and the players\' enjoyment while still having a good time
himself.

The Judeo-Christian creator is referred to as the Master of the Universe.

I say all of this only to demonstrate that these "roles" are all roles of a
"god."


>I think the best piece of advice I\'ve ever heard from a gamer, GM or
PC, is: "Remember, no matter how much fun you\'re having or how much
crap you\'re putting up with, one thing remains constant:  in the long
run, it\'s just a piece of paper.  So let it go and just have fun!"

Lots of actors would never get any work if they treated scripts so
trivially.  I believe in REALLY ROLE-PLAYING, not just die-rolling.  I
believe that you must invest yourself in your character until he/she is
dead; otherwise, you haven\'t been "realistic."

A good player will be good to his character and try to help his character
succeed and fulfill his needs.  This might include trying to get your
character "laid" or married.  I believe that a player should play his
character\'s WHOLE person.  I believe that a player should begin to feel
"regrets" for things left undone as he ages.

The Stainless Steel Rat series was exciting, even though the main
character survived.  Some of Star Wars was interesting, but the most
anyone ever lost was a hand.  Some people even enjoyed Asimov\'s Robot
stories, notwithstanding the fact that R. Daneel lived on for
centuries. 

I expect my players to invest a lot of themselves into their
characters.  I punish stupidity at times, but with every trial I allow
there is a way of escape.  When I play the opposition I play hard. 
When I think up problems I make them hard.  Sometimes a small mistake
can cause a loss of rewards.  But I am not infallible.  I allow
argument from players who feel that something was unfair.  Hard is
rewarding and fun.  Harsh is unnecessary.

Did I say they were all to be beaten?  No!  But if you don\'t present serious

Duhhh!  Obviously, I wasn\'t advocating killing off all the players...  I
specifically said (probably in another post) "kill or disable".  Players
need to see one of their group put in the ground every now and then.

Personally, I find "fun" in a realistic universe, where actions and

waltzing into a heated firefight.  Anything else is Monty Haul, in my

P.S.:  That the characters all made it through without injury shows that if
the books were based on an RPG session, they made good die rolls.

James Bond 007, as invincible as he is, often faces setbacks and sees his

how many Star Wars movies are there?  Didn\'t Obi-Wan bite the big

GM\'s reward? Admission fee?

No offense, Clif, but...

This has got to be one of the worst ideas I\'ve ever heard for running a
game group.

If your game isn\'t interesting enough that players want to survive \'till the
end already, you\'ve got more problems with it than a pot of money
will fix - and enough problems that it\'ll be overpriced at free, much less
with an admission fee.

I\'m imagining the Pilot character getting ready to launch the escape
ship, right before the space station explodes. "Wait for us, Ricky!! We\'ll
be aboard in two minutes, plenty of time!!". Ricky thinks a minute, the
player looks at the pot of money, and says, "Launch!"

Best way to get a bunch of die-rolling back-stabbing minimaxed
munchkins I\'ve ever seen, though...was that what you were aiming for?

Why? To put them in their place? To prove to them that the GM is in
charge? You can kill a PC whenever you want to. Are you rolling dice,
or creating a story?

A warning: campaigns are like guard monsters, they work best when
hungry. Kill one PC, it\'s an event. Kill a dozen, the deaths become
meaningless. I\'m not saying the campaign world has to be safe as an
amusement park ride, but you get very different games when you\'re not
running a slaughterhouse for PC\'s.

I\'ve been running Champions and Justice Inc. off and on for more than
a decade. In all that time, I\'ve killed TWO player characters. There are
more than two dozen people who would make a pizza run stark naked 
to get a seat in my games - because they found the games interesting.

Even the Call of Cthulu games I\'ve played in (only game with higher
casualty rate: Paranoia) managed to make deaths an event, if nothing
else than because our GM managed to give some reality to NPC\'s
before she offed them...you could have a known character die and not
have it be a player. Of course, we lost player characters by the boatload
as well...but she had more methods than PC death to scare us with.
After all, once you\'ve killed your victim, you can\'t scare them anymore....

Decisions should have consequences. The average man survives the
average military action, even if he\'s on the losing side. The average
combat casualty is injured, not killed. The average result of a barfight
is stitches, not the grave. If you have to put characters in the ground
to make a point, you\'ve got work to do.

Sorry, but the Domain of Deneb astrographically contains Reft Sector, in
which the Islands lie. The Imperium may nit have occupied them up to MT,
but they are within the Domain\'s boundary. Like that small African State in
the middle of South Africa whose name escapes me...

There was an article a few weeks back in Science News [Dec 12, 1998 vol.
154 p376 "Meet the Superbug"] that talked about bacterium D. radiodurans
that could thrive after exposures to 1.5 MILLION rads. (3+ million if
cold or frozen.) It essentially had the ability to reassemble it\'s DNA
from the Radiation blasted fragments. It is intrusting to ponder exactly
how such a life form could evolve on earth. 

The article did posit a answer: Dehydration resistance. Dehydration
generates the same type of DNA damage as irradiation. Furthermore the
same bacteria has been found in hot springs. 

The bug\'s has several repair mechanisms: A protein that can repair
double strand breaks; It keeps 4 to 10 full copies of it\'s genome in
each microbe; and some system of double checking the backups. 

The article is standard Science News fare: not too technical, yet with
some meat.

Here\'s a little game my friends and I often play while watching a movie.
It\'s called, "Spot the NPC."

It\'s usually pretty easy to do. Watch the movie, and try to figure out
(if the movie were a game session) which characters are PC\'s and which 
ones are not. 

All the Ewoks. All the X-Wing pilots, except Luke Skywalker. Everyone in 
every James Bond flick except Bond and (sometimes) his love interest.
All the Marines in _Aliens_, except Hicks. All NPC\'s. Hmmm, see how
many of these people died in the movies?

Characters who get murdered by the bad guys without contributing much
to the plot besides their murder (vengeance reason for PC\'s!) are
probably NPC\'s. Characters who move the plot along by telling other
characters what to do (rather than doing it themselves) are probably
NPC\'s. 

The guy in charge is often an NPC, unless he goes through significant
character development. A guy who dies heroically at a climactic moment
is usually a PC, unless he\'s a sidekick giving his life to save the heroes
(and even then he could be a PC).

I\'ve even seen movies where the main character was an NPC...for example,
the second and third Star Wars movies. I believe that Darth Vader was
the main character in those movies, his actions and eventual redemption
were the main line and everything else was a reaction to it.

Spot the NPC...fun for the whole family!!

I think the point is that RPG\'s tend towards the cinematic, rather than
the realistic as they are presumed to be escapist fun, not real-life
models of life as other people.

The PC\'s in most games are expected to be the James Bonds and Luke
Skywalkers of the game. As a GM, I have killed off player characters
before, but I make every possible allowance up to and including
completely disregarding the rolls and rules to keep the PC\'s alive. 

It\'s the nature of the game and is really dependent on the players own
personalities. Some people get really attached to their characters, even
though the players may be inexperienced and get their PC\'s into
untenable situations. They\'re having fun, which is the whole point.
Other people don\'t have a problem with their characters dying, so it\'s
less of a problem there.

What I have found happening with GM\'s who play the realistic \'War and
combat kills...life sucks...deal with it\' kind of game end up selecting
for players who deal with creating new characters all the time or find
ways of playing without doing combat.

They lose the players who want a more cinematic kind of experience.

I\'ve never had a surplus of players, so I tended to make it harder for
the characters to die.

OTOH, I also naturally play a more cinematic kind of game...the PC\'s in
my games tend to get caught up in the grand conflicts sweeping their
worlds/universes. Using realistic rules, they\'d be re-rolling characters
about every other session.

IMHO, IMTU and YMMV!

Thank you.

[The rest snipped for bandwidth.]

Then as I understand it, you are proposing that the use of the term 
"god" in reference to GMing is in relation to his ability to be the 
final arbitrator on the milieu/campaign he is running, and _within 
that context_, he is all-powerful.  And also that within the context 
of the campaign, there are none higher.  Under that definition and 
that context, I will say, yes, he is all of that.  The GM always has 
the last say in any gaming situation, even if it\'s "You\'re right.  It 
should be that way," or "Screw you!  My world, my rules!" or even 
"Yes, Dear.  You kill him.  Uh, does this mean I don\'t have to sleep 
on the couch tonight?"  :)

A good GM, whether he is a self-styled "god" control freak or an 
overly-generous "Monty Haul" storyteller, or a more balanced 
medium between each, allows PCs to make some changes (however small, 
however realistic) in the game world, over time and with appropriate 
effort.  I believe that, whatever semantics may be applied to my 
statement, that we agree on this.

Now the following is just my opinion, but I\'ve had bad experiences 
with GMs who call themselves "gods" over their games, who railroad 
their players, and who run games for no one else\'s entertainment but 
their own.  That\'s why I have a knee-jerk reaction to those who call 
themselves "gods" while running games.  I\'ve always viewed the GM as 
the Master of the Game, who runs a game with knowledge, skill and 
intent.  The better ones generally, *generally*, don\'t call 
themselves "gods," while the less mature or developed GMs tend, 
*tend*,  to do so.  My experience, YMMV.

(BTW, this has nothing to do with GMs who are portraying the roles of 
Gods in their FRPGs.  That\'s a role usually portrayed by the GM, and 
as such, is outside the scope of this discussion.  Shouldn\'t be used 
to support either approach to this discussion.)

I, too, believe in Role-Playing over ROLL-Playing.  However, I\'ve
gamed in situations where the rules became a point of contention
between players and/or players and the GM, and that ruined my fun. 
Remembering that the character is a ultimately a piece of paper is
reminding myself that I\'m here to play a game and have fun, not
argue and watch my blood pressure skyrocket.

To me, it\'s a reminder _to_ Role-Play, and to work within the
mechanics used by the GM to accomplish that.  It\'s a level of
detachment that gives me more freedom to play a character my way.  I
learned it from playing with some under-developed GMs who were
intimidated by players that know the rules, milieu, and gaming better
than they do, and want to strike back at the (to them) offending
player.  After all, what\'s the worst a GM can ever do to my
character?  Kill it?  Change its stats?  Tell me I can\'t play him
anymore?  These things matter little to me over the portrayal 
of my concept of the character, and this approach gives me the 
latitude to pursue my character concept as far as the GM allows.  
(Yes, another statement here that supports your "GM as god" stance.)  
And if the GM insists on racking such changes upon the character that 
the stats can no longer support my concept, I can let that piece of 
paper go and start over with another concept and another set of 
stats.  Again, it works for me.  YMMV.

The rest of your statements generally support our mutual viewpoint,
as defined within the context of the GM\'s _capacities_ within his
campaign.  Within that context, yes; beyond that context, well,
let\'s just say it takes two to tango, or to game in this case, and
just leave it at that.

Thanks for the feedback and the opportunity to clarify my 
points.  Hope everyone has an enjoyable weekend!

Geez Walt, if you had put this at the top, I wouldn\'t have had to read

Let\'s see: Proteins aren\'t a good choice (always, take in count this is what science
says today about why we are made like we are made) because they are very reactive (they
are catalysts for most of our body chemical reactions) and stability is a good thing to
look at when you want a molecule to hold information. But the good thing about proteind
is that can be made of (here in Earth) 20 aminoacids, sixteen more kinds of molecules
than our DNA, so it takes less space to hold the same information.

This is a double sided blade, because the tree base genetic code we have allows for
some redundancy that minimizes errors (i read an article on a journal that showed that
our genetic code is the best in one million when reducing single base mutations/errors
effects), and if the same info is to be encoded in just an aminoacid then ANY single
aminoacid change will cange the information held. And, if you store your information in
proteins, to what effector molecule do you translate that information, other than
proteins? That would imply another  kind of biomolecule, different from proteins, to be
used as the effector...too much work for me ;)


Let\'s see polysaccharides : hmm, they sure can store information, because not only
there are lots of them (different monosaccharides), but they can be polymerisated in a
large amount of combinations (always one reductor group with one alcohol group, and
there are 4 or more alcohol groups in a single monosaccharide).

So this makes the number of combinations between two single monosaccharides a large
group (not like proteins, that are assembled one amino group with one carboxi of the
next aminoacid, and aminoacid have usually one of these groups, with some exceptions:
lysine, arginine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid) and this makes easy to reduce space
(more info can be stored in less space).

But then, the reading molecules that translate this information to an effector molecule
(let\'s say proteins, why not?) have to be very efficient and complex to recongnize such
a large amount of combinations, and take the right "conclusions" of each combination.
Too complex, but i like it. Maybe some restrictions could be imposed to what
combinations could be made, because that information holding molecule has to be long,
and some of the combinations would not allow that, so if we finally get a short number
of combinations to be made with a reduced number of monosaccharides, this can be
do-able.

I think i\'ll put a LONG word to the subject...i cannot let my (biochemist student\'s)
mind wander this way  ;)

The Jump ship from Fighting ships would be my first choice.  It is unique
enough to be very interesting and would make a good PC ship.  Please include
the module for the towing system as part of the discription.  Also one ship
of each diferent size class would be good too.  A dreadnaught, cruiser,
destoyer/escort, frigete, carrier, spy ship, and a purpose built system
raider/pirate ship.

That place in (Tanzania, Rwanda, South Africa, Uganda??? Somwhere in

My point remains that the "TravelMaster" is there to serve the
players.  If the players feel as though the TM needs to be apeased
with gifts, or can be, then balance has gone out of your game.  Done
in jest can be humorous, but in effect it\'s poor form.  Handing a win
or a Monty Haul to the players is not what I\'m talking about.  Just
like the coach analogy, if he hands a trophy to the players at the
first practice there is no glory.  A hard won battle is the most
satisfying.  But having to bribe the coach to get in the game is right
out!

1) A big luxury liner...we have lot\'s of dinky little ships around, give
us the QEXXXIII ;-)

2) One dreadnaught, same principle as above.

3) A tramp starship OTHER than the Beowulf or Empress Marava class. I\'ll
nominate the YugoBox designs
(http://www.u.arizona.edu/~bjohnson/deckplans.html) if I may be so
immodest ;-)

4) A big ol\' freighter, something you can let loose an alien in, to eat
the crew...

5) The Happy Fun Ball (aka 800t Mercenary Cruiser)

6) A 100t scout/courier, other than the Sulieman, maybe a disk or sl
slab version.

7) Something real old and creaky, like the Orrimot. (see
http://www.u.arizona.edu/~bjohnson/TheTender.html for the original
design and write-up) Something that might be out there in a million
different forms hacked up by their 14th owners...

8) A yacht..what _does_ a rich playboy\'s ship look like on the inside?

9) Something alien, like a Hiver, or droyne ship, or something more
exotic...what would a Clotho ship be like?

10) An IISS survey cruiser.

My votes. If you want the YugoBoxes done up as GT designs, let me know,
I\'ll crank \'em out.

Actually, the original poster was more right than you give him credit for.
Believe it or not, the GM has to cooperate with the players. Really. The
analogy of a coach is not a perfect one, but I understood his point.

The role of a GM is much like the banker, in monopoly. He has a special job
above and beyond playing in the game, but he\'s still playing in the game.
It\'s still supposed to be fun for the GM and the players.

A good GM doesn\'t generally oppose his own players. Or at least he
shouldn\'t. A good GM works with them to create an interesting story. He may
create obstacles to block their path, but he\'s still playing as well. Any GM
can "beat" the players anytime he wants to. That\'s not what running a game
is all about.

If the scenario calls for it. Likewise, a bad GM will play all enemy
soldiers as crack-troops who take every opportunity to get behind cover and
supernaturally avoid the line of fire.

Actually, the hint of death can supply all the danger that\'s needed. I\'ve
fudged a number of rolls so that the group could manage to get away with one
or two PCs pulling their (severely) wounded away. There are other methods of
introducing danger into a game as well.

To be honest, I disagree that danger has to be introduced into a game to
make it exciting. I ran a Scout sanctioned scavenger hunt and race across a
subsector. There was _no_ danger of the PCs dying! They were completely
safe. It was still exciting, although it wasn\'t dangerous. This also
captured their attention far better than the combats that had come before.

>A coach is ALWAYS on his team\'s side (otherwise, can he really be called a

comprehension.


The GM _plays_ the opposition. That doesn\'t mean the GM _is_ the opposition.
The GM has to know what the characters in his campaign are capable of and
tailor adventures to them. He is on the side of the players, not the enemy
of the players.

>Remind me not to play in your campaign... I\'d get bored REAL QUICK!


It would probably be more fun than you\'re giving him credit for.

What\'s your point?  Are we cracking on ourselves, now?>

No, I was referring to someone who creates his or her own imaginary 
universe, calls him/herself a god, and plays in it alone.

The GM plays a variety of roles in the game and I think coach is one of 
those roles.  Yes, the GM does play the opposition as well but they also 
play the allies and contacts of the PCs (they should at least).  
Role-playing games are not supposed to be the GM vs. the players, but I 
suspect Clif plays it that way.

Yes, the GM has ALMOST complete control over the game.  But they don\'t 
(nor should they) have control over the most important part, the PCs.  A 
GM can and often does alter the results of probability but they can\'t 
control what a PC decides to do.  They can restrict it to a certain 
amount ("your character wouldn\'t know about that" or penalize for bad 
role-playing) but it is ultimately up to the player what the PC will 
decide to do. The GM cannot predict the future (I haven\'t seen any that 
can).  Therefore the GM is not all-knowing.  They can alter the future 
but cannot control/predict the PCs\' future decisions and reactions (if 
the GM does he/she is effectively playing by him/herself).

If the GM practices arbitrary use of power the game loses its\' 
\'suspension of disbelief\'. This will ruin the game, IMO, and limits the 
GM somewhat (at the least it limits good GMs). The GM may be nearly 
all-powerful in the game but the players have a collective Moot.  That 
is, they can veto and/or impeach the GM and dissolve the game.  The 
so-called "god" can do nothing to stop this.

<Clif also wrote: Isn\'t author of a sci-fi novel the "god" of that

No, the author is just a storyteller of an imaginary universe, but you

Easily, everyone has different perspectives on reality.  Obviously yours

I\'m not sure I remember what UTUP stands for?  I was referring to the 
IMTU code such as:

psi ++	:psionics are a major part of my game.  I have extended rules and 
most of my campaigns revolve around psionic institutes, zhodani spies, 
and the like.

psi +	:I enjoy using psionics and have created secret psionic societies 
for the game.  If one of the PCs wants to be a psi they are likely to be 
one but they will bear the chance of being caught.

psi	:psionics as per the rules.  It is very rare and unless a Zho or 
Droyne is involved it\'s unlikely to affect the plot.  The PCs have to 
pull teeth to get psionics and must watch their step.

psi -	:psionics take away from the other elements of Traveller.  I only 
use them as background and it will never affect the plot.

psi --	:psionics are so hokey.  I would never use them in a game.
!psi	:I ignore psionics (for whatever reason)
?psi	:I am not sure how to use psionics in my game.

Dang right!

What bugs me about this argument (that there shouldn\'t be
high-pop/insidious atmosphere worlds a parsec away from low pop garden
worlds) is that it embodies a completely erroneous assumption: that
high-pop worlds all result from high immigration. That\'s crazy. Sure, there
are worlds that the Imperium is putting great effort into colonizing, with
very large ships full of low-berthed colonists, but this is not how Pop 7
or Pop 9 worlds come about!

Really high populations obviously result from high population growth rates
- -- either due to high birth rates or low mortality or long lifespans. Maybe
the local conditions aren\'t great, the atmosphere is unbreathable, there
isn\'t much water, etc., but most human populations expand exactly as fast
as they are able (often faster than resources can support -- see Malthus).
People *like* to have lots of kids, whether its sensible to have them or
not.

Even if millions of people can afford to pull up stakes and move to a
garden world, individually or en masse, it\'s highly unlikely that such
emigration is going to make the slightest dent in the population growth
rate. In fact, birth rates might even *increase* to offset emigration; the
people left behind might think the exodus leaves more resources for them to
have more kids!

Further, most of these high-pop worlds have probably been inhabited since
at least the Rule of Man, maybe even since the Ziru Sirka. Maybe they were
never intended to be more than tiny mining colonies or research outposts.
During the Long Night, they didn\'t have the option to move to that "garden
world next door", or anywhere else beyond their system. And people kept
having kids and more kids, and so they kept adding another dome, another
tunnel complex, another atmosphere plant. A lot can happen over 1500 years.

Finally, a" garden world" might not be so idyllic as the UWP seems to
suggest. Sure, you can breathe the air, but maybe the indigenous life forms
are based on poisonous left-handed proteins. Perhaps the climate sucks real
bad. Maybe the rotation rate is such that hurricanes are a constant threat.
Maybe the axial tilt is extreme. Maybe the planet is constantly pummelled
by asteroids and comets. Maybe the local government doesn\'t allow
immigration.

Use your imagination, folks! The referee is supposed to make inferences
from the UWP; if the population seems too low, then this should suggest
that there\'s a good *reason* why it\'s too low.

Hey! I disagree. Vasquez was a PC! She died heroically though. Hudson was a
PC too, but the GM couldn\'t bear to put up with his ceaseless whining!

You see, Hudson was poorly played. In real life he was acted much the same
way. During that gaming session he would screech things like, "WHAT, WE\'RE
OUT OF CHIPS? WHAT\'RE WE GONNA DO NOW, HUH?" and "OH MAN, MY D6 CHIPPED WHEN

The GM had to kill him off so he\'d go home.

	As I referee, I have found one and only one way to "win" when the players say
thank you for a good game and want to play again.   Guess what, this can
happen even if lots of PC\'s get killed, or if they don\'t.  The important thing
is that they don\'t get bored, and often the other PC\'s have as much to do with
this as the GM does.

The problem with DNA and radiation is, I believe, that the
radiation comes along and cleaves the strand.  The strand
then has to be fixed correctly.  Replacing it with
other polymers won\'t change that.

Solutions are multiple copies of DNA (some radiation resistant
bacteria do this), addition strands (some redundant?), improved
repair abilities.  Also, small genomes would be good to.  A lot
of DNA doesn\'t code for anything, but represents places it can
be damage, you want to reduce this.  (Pine trees suffered more
at Chernoybl (sp?) becase they have large genomes).

The problem is more generic than that. Radiation comes along, smacks
into various molecules in the cell, and creates free radicals, which are
extremely reactive compounds. Any long chain polymer needed for encoding
genetic information will be attacked and damaged.

 It doesn\'t have to be, in fact almost certainly won\'t be DNA, but for
maintenance of a genetic code, you need a carrier of a lot of
information. Chemically speaking that means polymers of some sort.

That information will be dependent on the sequence of units of the code.
(This is, btw, from basic communications theory, not necessarily tied to
biochemistry) Chemical code components will be susceptible to the
alterations that occur upon reaction with free radicals, much like
static on a phone line can interfere with the transmission of modem
signals.

End result is much the same, you drop your connection (the organism
dies) or you get your information altered along the way, leaving a
corrupted file (mutant organism).

The key to dealing with high levels of static (radiation exposure) is a
combination of active error correction (things like DNA repair
transcriptases, multiple copies of the coding molecule) and line
conditioning (antioxidants).

Top 10, heh?

Well, there are gazillions of deckplans and specs for all the normal
ships; traders, gunboats, a few destroyers, etc.

What I would like to see is some specialty ships along the following 
lines (not necessarily in order of appearance):

The Emperor\'s Yacht
Safari Vessels for different atmospheric types: water, gas giant, etc.
Belter 
Gas Collection 
Racing Gig 
Ship Tender 
Fighters (not necessarily in great detail) w/ accompanying Carrier.
"One really good" space station (modular for different situ\'s)

I hope this helps.

The article actually mentions that:
"...There are rare cases in which radioactive elements such as uranium
or thorium concentrate under-ground in large amounts, but the radiation
fluxes near those sites are still small compared with what the microbe
can withstand..."

It only takes 500 to 1000 Rads to kill most people. This little bug can
take 1.5 MILLION RADS.

This I can relate to. I almost never used any pre-planned scenario, the boys
just never go for it. Hell, now most of the time I\'ll start with a random
encounter and see where the PCs take me. I\'ve got to think on the run, but
its fun and the PCs are sure to read more into something then I\'ve EVER

What bugs me about this argument (that there shouldn\'t be
high-pop/insidious atmosphere worlds a parsec away from low pop garden
worlds) is that it embodies a completely erroneous assumption: that
high-pop worlds all result from high immigration. That\'s crazy. Sure,there
are worlds that the Imperium is putting great effort into colonizing, with
very large ships full of low-berthed colonists, but this is not how Pop 7
or Pop 9 worlds come about!
</Glenn Grant>

Yes!  Right on!  I\'ve always *hated* that whole "garden world=hi pop" 
concept. I really think people are engaging in terribly terracentric
thinking when they assume these sorts of things.  It\'s hard for some to
see that these worlds are not *colonies* anymore, they\'re *homeworlds*,
People have lived there for scores of generations and this is what\'s
normal to them. 

<Glenn>
Really high populations obviously result from high population growth rates
- - -- either due to high birth rates or low mortality or long lifespans.
Maybe
the local conditions aren\'t great, the atmosphere is unbreathable, there
isn\'t much water, etc., but most human populations expand exactly as fast
as they are able (often faster than resources can support -- see Malthus).
People *like* to have lots of kids, whether its sensible to have them or
not.
</Glenn>

Preach it, brother! :-)

<Glenn>
Even if millions of people can afford to pull up stakes and move to a
garden world, individually or en masse, it\'s highly unlikely that such
emigration is going to make the slightest dent in the population growth
rate. In fact, birth rates might even *increase* to offset emigration; the
people left behind might think the exodus leaves more resources for them
to have more kids!
</Glenn>

Another thing to consider is that these people who are leaving will
probably head, not for a garden world, but for a world much like *home*. 
Consider a group of folks who\'ve been living on an airless rock for
*centuries*.  They KNOW how to build up soil from native rock and dust,
they KNOW how to set up good air recycling and water treatment, they
instinctively take good care of vacc suits and check air-lock pressure
indicators, etc.  In short, they have all the culture, expertise, and
knowledge which make a rockball the perfect environment for them.  Why
would they move somewhere where they have to deal with such new problems
as weather and a competitive alien biosphere? (As recently discussed on
the TML, planting your own crops in soil that\'s permeated with alien
biomass is a non-trivial task).

<Glenn> 
Finally, a "garden world" might not be so idyllic as the UWP seems
to suggest. Sure, you can breathe the air, but maybe the indigenous life
forms are based on poisonous left-handed proteins. Perhaps the climate
sucks real bad. Maybe the rotation rate is such that hurricanes are a
constant threat.  Maybe the axial tilt is extreme. Maybe the planet is
constantly pummelled by asteroids and comets. Maybe the local government
doesn\'t allow immigration.. 
</Glenn>

Yes, I think there\'s and unfortunate tendency for people to see a UPP of
867000-0 and think "Hey, it\'s just like earth!  Why doesn\'t everybody move
there, since earth is just SO great!"  They forget that it\'s almost
definately NOT just like earth and that even if it was, most of the
population of the galaxy, having lived on non-terran type worlds for the
past millenium at least, would not consider it so wonderful necessarily.
Honestly, this is not the kind of thinking I\'d expect from SF fans, it\'s
kinda narrow-minded like the Solomani supremacist philosophy or--oh wait,
I\'m beginning to see the light... :-)

	Scratch the boiling water. All it took was the ability to flake
knife blades. Obsidian flakes are incredibly sharp AND naturally
sterile when fresh. The rock is so impermeable that the inside of the
rock is as clean of life as possible--it formed from molten rock,
after all, and nothing has been able to get in since.

deliberate "surgical*" trauma, and (b) patient having survived for
years AFTER the surgery ...

	In fact, increasing TL actually makes things WORSE ... deliberate
surgical cleanliness wasn\'t even considered until very late in
history. Most surgeon\'s "tools" weren\'t even cleaned between
patients. In fact, IIRC the "surgeon" was most often also a butcher,
because he had the right tools ...

*Surgical in quotes because we\'re not quite sure what the purpose
was--if it was therapeutic, it was surgery (even if it was based on a
theory of "let the bad spirits out" instead of "relieve intracranial
pressure").

I do SO love AltaVista!!!

First hit lead to an article in Science about a French firm mining the
last of these, which gave me the name of the place Oklo. Oklo lead to:

http://alamut.com/proj/98/nuclearGarden/bookTexts/Lovelock_Oklo.html

and 

http://www.sciam.com/1998/0698issue/0698wonders.html

Which refs an article in the July 1976 issue of Scientific American.

Basically what happened, is that _b_illions of years ago, the percentage
of U235 was high enough in these deposits that ordinary water would act
as a moderator, rather than heavy water. This allowed a fission reaction
to build up and sustain itself.

The French discovered this when the mined the site (it is in Gabon, BTW)
and shipped the ore off home to be purified, wherupon it was found to
already be depleted of U235. This lead to a lot of headscratching, to
put it mildly...


This is a quote from another web site:

http://nova.nuc.umr.edu/~ans/oklo.html

"... If a canister holding either a whole fuel assembly or solidified
waste should disintegrate, even soon after its emplacement in a
repository, there is good reason to believe that the fission products
and TRU nuclides would not diffuse far into the environment. Strong
support for this contention is furnished by what has become known as the
_Oklo phenomenon_. Oklo is the name of a uranium mine in the African
nation of Gabon, where France obtains much of the uranium for her
nuclear program. When uranium from this mine was introduced into a
French gaseous diffusion plant, it was discovered that the feed uranium
was already depleted below the 0.711 w% of ordinary natural uranium. It
was as if the uranium had already been used to fuel some unknow reactor

And so it had. French scientists found traces of fission products and
TRU waste at various locations within the mine. These observations were
puzzling at first, because it is not possible to make a reactor go
critical with natural uranium, except under very special circumstances
with a graphite or heavy water moderator, neither of which could
reasonably be expected to have ever been present in the vicinity of
Oklo. The explanation of the phenomenon is to be found in the fact that
the half-life of U235, 7.13E8 years, is considerably shorter than the
half-life of U238,4.51E9 years. Since the original formation of the
earth, more U235 has therefore decayed than U238. This, in turn, means
that the enrichment of natural uranium was greater years ago than it is
today. Indeed, it is easy to show (see Prob. 2.37) that about 3 billion
years ago this enrichment was in the neighborhood of 3 w%, sufficiently
high to form a critical assembly with ordinary water, which is known to
have been present near Oklo at that time.

The relevance of the Oklo phenomenon to present-day disposal of
radioactive wastes is that neither the fission products (identified by
their stable daughters) nor the plutonium migrated from the Oklo site in
the billions of years since the reactor was critical. "

I\'d like to see:
1. Vargr corsair/frigate
2. Imperial destroyer (something in the 1000-3000 dTon range, like a Midu)
3. Medium freighter (again in the 1000 dTon range)
4. Some kind of fixed isntallation (a small highport or misc spacestation)
5. Low-tech merchant ship (something at Trav-tech-level 9 - fusion rockets,
   maybe even spun gravity, heavily refitted to still make a living)
6. SDB (400-1000 dTons)
7. Lab ship
8. Medium exploration ship (1000-2000 dTons)

I guess that\'s not ten yet...Although (like everyone) I\'d love to see deckplans
for a serious warship, it\'s not going to happen; partial deckplans for the AHL
fill an entire box, after all; you can\'t do even a real cruiser in a book
at a decent scale and have room for anything else. It\'s also not *useful*.
You could have "experts" from deckplans for (say) a Tigress - parts PCs
are likely to see, like the hangers. And the brig. But having the whole
TRigress only matters if you have a firefight that travels the length
of it.

Much more useful is a warship at a size that PCs might routinely encounter it,
or imagine having to salvage, or escape from, or crew - a destroyer or 
destroyer escort.

Before my PBEM, "Candles Against The Night\', went into stasis for a bit, my 
characters were learning all about grendals.  The place was a little planet 
called, amusingly enough, Grendal, a quiet TL10 water world just outside the 
Carrillian Assembly, in Drexilthar Subsector of Reavers Deep.

I\'d say some more, but the game *WILL* resume again someday, hopefully with 
the same players, and I don\'t wanna blow any secrets.

  {
    'body' => 'A few days ago I mentioned the book "Mother of Storms" by John Barnes (ISBN
0-75280-886-9) which describes a situation where hurricanes would become
self sustaining and devastating. Someone asked how it worked, but I
couldn\'t answer then. However, I bought a copy of the book and skim read it
tonight so here is an attempt at a brief summary; no doubt there are
members of the TML who could comment on the feasibility of the whole thing.

Stage 1 - Changes to the environment to allow the scenario.

a) Methane is trapped in the seabeds in clathrates (23 water molecules
making a cage around 4 methane molecules). Clathrate beds are found
throughout the world, and those in the Arctic Ocean are tens of metres
deep, and hundreds of kilometres across.

b) These are disturbed and landslides and collapses occur as the ice
surrounding the methane melts, releasing it. Thousands of years of deposits
are released as further collapses occur causing more landslides etc. [In
the book, the release is triggered by the use of low yield weapons against
a missile base located on the Arctic seabed. 173 billion tonnes of methane
is released, raising atmospheric methane levels to 37 times those in 1992.]

c) The methane is a greenhouse gas. This traps heat, and will as a result
allow the air to retain more moisture. Interaction with sea water will
increase ocean temperatures. Potentially, the earth\'s albedo is reduced, as
the extra heat in the atmosphere results in glaciers and snow melting
earlier in the spring, and retards/inhibits their formation in the autumn
(fall). This can act as a feedback effect over time increasing the water
content in the air, thus the heat etc etc.

d) As a result of this heating, the area within the 27.5 deg C isotherm
increases, as ocean temperatures rise (estimating 40% transfer rates
between air and water). The 27.5 isotherm is the point where the energy
supplied by the water exceeds the losses in wind moving the heat, and
allows hurricanes to grow. Below 27.5 hurricanes will \'burnout\' as they are
not sustainable. Hurricanes act as a heat engine. Heat from the warm ocean
is moved to the base of the cool stratosphere, and wind is generated to
drive this process.

[In the book the hurricane formation zones (areas within the 27.5 isotherm)
expand from the two or three usual in the Pacific to one large one 11000
miles across and 3500 miles wide.]

e) The force of a hurricane is determined by two things, the water
temperature and the distance travelled over the water hot enough to allow
hurricanes to be generated. Usually this is 1500 or 2000 miles at most, and
most hurricanes are in the zones for less than 24 hours, and have wind
speeds not exceeding 100 mph.

[The effect in the book means that hurricane size limits have been raised
dramatically.]

Stage 2 - initiation of the first storm.

a) A hurricane is generated - eventually the cold air at upper atmosphere
levels and the warm, moist air over the sea become unstable (perhaps as a
result of upper level wind action), and the warm air bubbles up to the
tropopause (the point where temperature starst to fall). More warm air is
drawn into the space at sea level where the rising air came from. The warm
air at the tropopause spreads out, and a cell is created, drawing in at the
bottom and blowing out at the top. Coriolis forces impart a spin to the air
drawn in, which can come from more than 100 kilometres away. Eventually,
the spiralling air at the base of the hurricane becomes too \'thick\' (a ring
of clouds) for more air to break through, and the ring starts to spin
faster and faster around the central column and high winds start to spin
around it, drawing up. The central column, deprived of an air supply
empties and becomes the clear eye of the hurricane. The corkscrew of air
around the eye pumps air more efficiently and eventually reaches the
tropopause, driving a more efficient outspreading of air. In turn, more air
is sucked in at the base, faster....

b) The motion of the hurricane is driven by coriolis force, plus the
direction of the upper air streams. In addition, motion is limited by the
warm water formation zones, as a hurricane exiting one of these will \'burn
out\'.

Stage 3 - The formation of child hurricanes

a) Airflow out of hurricanes is not always in all directions. Occasionally
an outflow jet forms when the hot air organises itself into a single column
out of the hurricane. This is more efficient at transfering mass and energy
than before, so removes a limit on hurricane size as more air (mass) can be
drawn through the heat engine which is the hurricane.

b) All this air comes down in a single spot where the outflow jet touches
down. This generates a high pressure region where air is blown outwards,
towards the low of the hurricane\'s eye. Thus the hurricane starts to be
blown around the ocean.

c) Bigger hurricanes tend to have outflow jets, and some may have several.
But the hurricane\'s motion becomes erratic as the outflow jet is not stable
and can move about, touching down at different places. This can lead to the
hurricane wandering erratically, and contradicting the \'steering\' currents
of air at 20,000 feet. (the upper air streams mentioned above).

d) With a bigger hurricane (such as those permitted by the zones described
in the first section) the outflow can grow to the point it becomes the
primary determinant of the direction in which the hurricane moves,
overiding coriolis force and the steering currents. The jets tend to
\'wobble\' around the hurricane, counter clockwise. If the outflow is dragged
behind in the steering current\'s path it will accelerate the motion of the
hurricane.

e) Where outflow jets touch down, they deposit moisture, and generate high
levels of wind shear as the wind blows out from the touch down point. This
generates cumulonimbus clouds (thunderheads) which have strong updrafts
starting a cell. Around the touchdown point tornadogenesis is common, with
air rotating around local low pressure points.

f) When the outflow jet moves/lifts the high pressure downdraught is gone,
and the moist, warm, rotating air previously pressed down starts to rise.
This leads to high wind shears being generated, sucking up moist air to
replace the rising previously pressed down air.  In normal hurricanes the
outflow touches down close enough to the eye for the high pressure air to
be drawn in.

g) In a hurricane with vastly increased energy this is not necessarily the
case. A situation with conditions suitable for the generation of a second
hurricane has been reached, provided the 27.5 isotherm hasn\'t been crossed.

Stage 4 - The Mother of Storms.

a) With the outflow jet driving the hurricane, and the expanded warm areas
suitable for sustaining hurricanes they may loop around again instead of
wandering off and burning out. In the mean time, the mother and her child
hurricanes continue to grew and spawn.

b) The eye reaches 350 km diameter, and wind speeds of 250 metres per sec,
faster than tornados. Wind resistance increases rapidly as Mach 1 is
approached and the hurricane stabilise around Mach 0.7, and becomes
insensitive to further loops through the warm water. A significant increase
in ocean temperature is needed, at which point the hurricane will rapidly
grow and in a matter of minutes acheive Mach 1.2.

[Fortunately, in the scenario proposed in the book this will only happen in
summer, in the shallowest areas.]

c)When this happens, the lowered pressures in the storm lifts even more
warm water into the air, improving atmospheric/sea water heat transfer and
thus the sea temperature rises, increasing the power of the hurricane.

d) At this point massive storm surges and high winds will probably wipe out
most of the planet\'s population.

Hope that was of interest,

1)  A small merchant - not a *Marava* or a *Beowulf*, but something else
around the same size, or a wee bit bigger, and a jump-2 or jump-3 drive.
2)  A good-sized freighter - *Leviathan*, or maybe something up in the
10kton range.
3)  A liner of about the same size.
4)  A destroyer.
5)  A cruiser - say around 20 ktons.
6)  A yacht.
7)  A bigger scout - say 300-500 tons.
8)  At least one non-Imperial warship.
9)  At least one non-Imperial merchant or other civilian ship.
10)  A generic space station, with various modules to adapt it for
different worlds/purposes - stores, lodging, bars, warehouses (regular,
cold, liquid, &c), offices.

This too is my interpretation of the way TLs work.
What is the knowledge base possessed by most sophonts on this world?
Check the TL.
*Pre-literate cultures should be able to be rated on the TL scale*.
Symbolic representation of language, maps, etc. is a big idea, like the
development of numbers.

Making TL 1\'s index \'knowledge achievement\' the development of the
concept of writing and numbers seemed like a good idea at the time.

Re surgery :-
Yes, it is possible at TL 1, even TL 0. Success rates are not too good
though.... especially without anaesthesia, analgesics and somewhat more
scrupulous antisepsis than \'boiling water\' (though Vland would pose a
notable exception to the last requirement).

<shameless plug>
Check my series on \'Medicine In Traveller\' which Jeff Zeitlin has kindly
posted on Freelance Traveller.
One possible TL progression is described there.

LOWDOWN:

I\'m starting to recruit for a new PBEM.  I\'m sending this to both lists
so have patients with me as I attempt to explain my philosophy.

I\'ve tried a number of different approaches to PBEM\'s and none have
proven entierly satisfactory to me, the lag time is to great, it\'s
difficult to get a hold of some people, some people are more active than
others and so the list goes on.

In an attempt to remedy this I\'ve decided to run a PB-ICQ live on
alternating Saturday nights.  That\'s my initial goal, but it\'ll like be
modified as time goes on to reflect both my and the player\'s ability to
be online.

SETTING:

Having sent this to both lists I\'m expecting to be hacked apart for my
Heritical views on one of these lists but hell I\'m a Heritic and proud
of it.

The game will be set in a small Pocket Empire, known as the
Confederation of Nightrim, on the Reavers Deep Daibei boarder.  The game
will be set in the TNE universe and Virus will exist.  The charater\'s
will begin as members of the Confederation of Nightrim Exploration and
Recon Service, CNERS (Sinners) and the game will progress from there as
we get a feel for our respective characters.

I\'d invite you to check out my site but unfortunately my site server is
down at the moment so you\'ll have to hang in there for a day or so.

RULE SET:

I\'ll be using a slightly modified version of the TNE ruleset.  Why,
because I like d20\'s and my cat\'s go crazy when I spin them across the
table.  8^)

WHEN:

approx 18:00-22:00 PST (GMT -0800)

That\'s about it.

If you\'re interested or just curious drop me a line.

Thanks

I just duplicated the manner in which the existing sensors were built in
the bridges included in GT.

1) Hmm, I\'ll have to check my copy of Vehicles (not handy here) and get
back to you on that one.

2) I assumed it was for protection and streamlining.  Sensor arrays do
not appear to be streamlined (or I can\'t find the location in Vehicles
where it deals with this...)

I don\'t think Vehicles have given the same thought and consideration
towards modern/futuristic sensor arrays...house rules perhaps?

Typicaly GURPS sensors face one direction (forward, left, up, down,
starboard, aft, etc).
To get spherical coverage around a starship you would need 6 sensors or 2
sensors in universial turrets. It goes without saying that kilo for kilo 2
sensors in turrets weigh less than 6 fixed.  And if you want redundent
sensors. . .

>(2) Why pop turrets rather than normal turrets? Is it for protection? (Is

Both I would think.  Also it isn\'t that the sensor makes a ship less
streamlined it\'s the turret that it is mounted in that decreases it\'s
atmospheric speed if it isn\'t retracted.  Not that you would necessarily
retract it any time you enter an atmosphere but it is nice to have options.

GURPS vehicles doesn\'t differentiate between phased arrays and mechanically
scanning sensors (part of it\'s \'genericness\' I guess).  But even if it did
I would assume that you would want a sensor that would be inside your armor
envelope rather than covering the surface of your hull.

What bugs me about that statement is that it ignores a point that I\'ve tried
several times to get across. It\'s not one high-population hellhole next to
a low-population eden that bothers me, it\'s _50_ high-population hellholes
next to 50 low-population edens.

It\'s also wrong. I don\'t make that assumption. I do make the assumption that
_everything else being equal_ people will prefer worlds where life support
is cheap to worlds where it is expensive.

Sure, I don\'t think that every thing else is always equal. Sometimes a ship
misjumps and stick you in a system with a crappy world (Of course, misjump
colonies on crappy worlds would have greater chances of failure than on
friendly worlds, but some could beat the odds). Sure, some hellholes have
resources that compensate for the increased life support problems. But then
again, some edens have rich resources AND are great places to live.

Pop 7 you might get that way, but hardly pop 9, agreed.

The problem with that is that if that was true (which it most definitely
can\'t be in the Traveller universe (see below)) then that simply means that
all the LOW-population worlds are wildly unlikely.

So why do some countries on Earth today approach zero population growth?

You miss the point. It\'s not why the hell-hole has a high population, it\'s
why the eden world is low population. If population expansion is as inevitable
as you claim, why did the people who settled the eden world not expand to a
lot more than the population of the hell-hole? They have the same procreative
imperatives and a much more survivable environment.
 
>Further, most of these high-pop worlds have probably been inhabited since

Not in the Spinward Marches. In -1500 the _only_ worlds with human populations
was Darrian, Algine, Vanejen and \'a few Zhodani worlds\'.

>A lot can happen over 1500 years.

It dosen\'t take that long if you practice unrestricted breeding. If you have
a population growth of 3% pa. you get a doubling of the population in about 
24 years. Slightly higher than that and you get a 10-doubling ever century.
Start with 10,000 people (a not unreasonable size of a colony expedition, and
you reach population level 9 in six centuries. But it\'s actually worse than
that. If the colony is composed mostly of young couples, you get a completely 
skewed population growth for the first 30 or 40 years and can easily get a
10-doubling in that time. Add a small steady stream of immigrants and most
worlds can reach pop 9 in 4 centuries or so. And, of course, colonies with
more than 10,000 initial members is perfectly possible (The original Tarsus
colony was 19,000 odd people).

Bottom line: The history of Charted Space only makes sense if unrestricted
breeding is the exception rather than the rule among most of the societies
there, especially the starfaring ones. (And that most emphatically includes
the Aslans!)

Of course, if you breed faster than you can expand your capacity to support
t6he population, you run into a natural limit to growth. And such a limit is
more likely to apply on worlds where you have to build your life support
systems than on worlds where the air is breathable and food can be grown
from the soil. In other words, a high-population garden world is no surprise,
merely a world where they have forgotten the lessons of history. But a high-
population hellhole is a world that has beaten tremendous odds and made huge
investments. Of course there should be some such worlds. But does it make
sense that there are exactly as many high-population hellholes as high-
population edens? I think not.

So who says that anestesia is unavailable at TL 1? And the _concept_ of
scrupulous antisepsis is not TL related. The question is: What technology
is necessecary to implement scrupulous antisepsis _once you have the idea_?
If you can do it at TL 1, then it is TL 1, not TL 4, even if it didn\'t
occur _On Earth_ until the Age of Reason.
 
You may need a microscope to discover germ theory on your own, but you don\'t
need any technology to have it explained to you.

This answer is cannon.  In Adv 12 (IIRC) Secret of the Ancients the

Planetary UPP\'s are not short so they fit better in the computer,
planetary UPP\'s are short because thre Imperium has tens of thousands of
planets & needs to be able to _simply_ classify them.  It also has
trillions of sophonts whose time is valuable & can get some information
about the planet from the UPP.  If the charecteres want more info they
can always hit the more button & the computer will provide more [if it
has it], the UPP is just the best place too start.

IMTU [Milieu 1100] they are backed up to hard copy, which does have
space limitations, anyway.  Most ships have a 3,000 page book, which
looks something like the 1 volume photoreduced edition of the OED, with
stats for all the planets on paper, just in case.

Second Survey Data, Imperium and Surrounds, reduced data version.
Cr 100 3 kg TL A (printed on very thin plastic pages) 

It comes in a fairly sturdy case with a magnifying glass.  The book is
heavy enough to be used as a club [+1 DiffMod because books dont have
convenient handholds] in case you need/want to whap someone/something up
along side of the head with it.

This is the version charecters can use to look stuff up in when the
computers are down.  IMTU better shiops will have a set on the bridge, 1
in the ships locker & 1 on ships vehicles, of any, lifeboats will
definately have a copy.

It is also neat because you can justify whatever [beyond UPP} you, as
ref, want to leave out by claiming it was edited for space.  This book
has a certain resemblance to a less whimsical version of The Hitchikers
Guide to the Galaxy.  [For those of you who dont recall Earths entry was
due to be updated from "Harmless" to Mostly Harmless" for example.]

No reference on hand, but it appears to have operated during the rainy
season. Rainwater would seep into the rocks and slow down the naturally
produced neutrons enough to start a chain reaction. It\'d keep running
until it ran out of water, and then "shut down" until the next rainy
season.

Eventually the concentration of fissionables dropped too low to sustain
a reaction.

They identified it because a rich vein that *looked* like it was
getting richer started yeilding *less* uranium. And when they analyzed
the ore in detail, they found the fission by-products.

So not only did the reactor operate on its own, but the wastes stayed
put. 

It\'d be a moderately rare occurence. It takes a pretty rich deposit
*and* has to be fairly early in a planet\'s lifetime (some the
fissionables haven\'t decayed naturally all that much). 

Still, it\'d tend to happen in exactly the sort of place people would be
looking for. A *rich* deposit of uranium. And if you lay the deposit
out right, the first hint they\'ll have is a while after rainy season
starts.

Possible indications:

1. miners get sick (lethal dose). This is because if their exposure
   increases fast enough to make them sick *before* the regular check
   of their film badges, they\'ll have had to get enough of a dose to
   kill them.
2. exposure badges tested at end of week (or is it end of shift?) show
   *huge* doses. Anybody know how often they check badges at uranium
   mines? Anyway, odds are that the miners *will* get really sick
   unless they got lucky on how fast the radiation increased versus
   when the badges were checked. But they shouldn\'t die.
3. they\'ve gone to the extra expense of having actual radiation
   monitoring gear in the mine instead of just relying on film badges.
   The monitors would show a sharp rise in background and it\'d keep
   rising for quite a bit (depends on exactly how close the the
   "reactor" the mine has gotten)

An important note here. This sort of thing is related to an interesting
safety concern when storing refined fissionables. 

The human *body* can act as a moderator. There has been at least one
case where blocks of fissionable were placed such that they were "safe"
(ie didn\'t interact dangerously with each other) but *became* dangerous
when an unfortunate technician stepped between them. 

Basicly the fast neutrons being emitted were slowed enough in passing
thru him to stimulate extra fissions in the piece on the opposite side.
The result tends to be a rather quick "flash" reaction as the neutron
levels cascade rapidly to the point where the other radiation causes a
*visible* bluish "flash" in the air. 

Needless to say, the person who triggers such a reaction is dead, even
though he probably won\'t show any symptoms for 15 minutes to several
hours. 

I don\'t *think* a deposit is likely to be rich enough for this to
happen as you walk down a narrow tunnel, but I wouldn\'t swear to it
(You\'d probably have to have to walls seeping water to provide extra
moderation, which means there\'s likely enough activity for a rad meter
to trigger)

Hell, that "garden world" isn\'t all that attractive. There aren\'t any
shopping malls. No cities. How many urban dwellers would want to move
to somewhere that\'s a week from anything much more advanced than an old
fashioned general store, doesn\'t have indoor plumbing, has poor
schools, and you have to do *hard* work *outdoors*.

Pioneer types aren\'t *really* as common as we think. And they tend to
come from the areas that are *already* on the fringe of "civilization"
rather than from the big cities. 

The "city folk" who *do* make good pioneers tend to be from the slums,
not from the middle class. And a *lot* of them will die.

Just consider how few folks in the crowded parts of the US want to move
to *real* small towns (as opposed to ones just beyond the suburbs of a
metro area) much less to a *wilderness* like the Alaskan or Canadian
"bush".

Heck, it doesn\'t have to be based on that at all. You use brief codes
to convey info *fast*. Such as in a listing where space is at a
premium. 

I expect that a lot of "interfaces would display a starmap, and
depending on the scale, either display the UWP right alongside (or
under) the name, or is more crowded, display the name and UWP as you
move the "cursor" from star to star. 

If you pull up a display of a *system*, there\'ll be more info on the
mainworld. If you pull up a display of the world, then you get the
*detailed* info. Probably hypertext linked so the level of detail for
various items depends on which ones you are interested in.

Yes. So do the ones from meteors.

Let\'s see. Hal Clement suggested Zeolites (an odd sort of long chain
silicate that has lots of places for chemical groups to "nest" and
react). They actually *are* used as or in conjunction with a lot of
catalysts. So they might be able to act as "keys" for synthesizing
protiens. Or even for synthesizing RNA. They\'d be a *lot* bulkier than
DNA. Which makes for larger cells, but also makes for better radiation
immunity. 

It\'s also been theorized that certain silicate(?) compounds/structures
found in clays may have acted as templates for early protien formation.
If so, maybe in the high rad environment, the first cells kept a chunk
of the "clay" with them. This could lead to a sort of "silicate"
backboned genetic material. 

NO, I don\'t have references for the clay idea. I read it in something.
Possibly an old Scientific American.

Not quite. You got the number right. But it\'s the transition between

In fact, since blades get dull with use, it\'d be *natural* to use a
freshly made blade for surgery, because even a "savage" will realize
that he wants the sharpest blade he can get for this sort of thing!

A common failing is to think that "low tech" = "stupid". I think that
disabusing players of this can be both educational for the players, and
great fun for the GM!

Just one example:
"Glass beads" are seen as valuable because making beads is one hell of
a tedious, *difficult* practice. So natives aren\'t being dumb to accept
them. 

Wait til the players find out that the "rare" gemstones they\'ve been
trading the beads to the natives for are so common that the kids used
them for marbles, but only when they couldn\'t manage to get something
"better". :-)

Heck, just use Turtledove\'s "World War" series. Have the aliens come

You\'ve reminded me of something I read somewhere. They clathrates are a
sort of reddish orange color, and look (and act) rather like an odd
sort of ice. 

As I recall, they are stable at temps somewhat above 4C, which, being
the temp at which water is densest, is the temp of just about all deep
sea regions. 

All you need to form the stuff is methane (bacteria in a low oxygen
environment such as the sea bottom produce lots of it as they break
down organic materials in the bottom "ooze"), water, and moderate
pressures (also found on the sea bottom).

When you finish reading "Beowulf\'s Children" I expect that you\'ll have

Children or don\'t care about the ending.


I expect that once the colony either redevelops space travel, or gets

This must come as a shock to the Darrians, the Sword Worlds, the Federation
of Arden, and all the Zhodani and non-aligned worlds within those same
boundaries, not to mention the Solomani worlds in the Domain of Sol.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Imperial Domains were established before the areas they covered were
fully incorporated into the Imperium - such incorporation was one of the
main tasks of the Archduke of each domain. The boundries of a domain
were based on a grouping of sectors, which is astrographic rather than
political - basically, the Archduke was given a block of sectors and
told to take it. In several domains, the Imperial border stabilized before
the domain was completely incorporated - usually due to outside forces.

The Domain of Deneb was the last domain established, the very
last to get an Archduke (not \'till the height of the Rebellion), and will
never be entirely incorporated - there is little need for more expansion,
and (at least in the early 1100\'s) there are strong interstellar states
beyond the borders.

For those without the maps, Egyrn subsector is the next one to rimward
of District 268, Pax Rulin is the subsector rimward of Glisten - both
are just across the edge of the Spinward Marches map. Pax Rulin is
used as a jumping-off point for the Leviathan adventure I mentioned, it
has some Imperial planets in it.

If you can get Jim Vassilakos\' Galactic program, he has all these
subsectors detailed. Galactic is an excellent program for displaying
and even generating (CT style) subsectors, it has most published
subsectors in it\'s library. I think you can find it at

        Hi, Walt!
        I have a gaming group which runs the width of Canada (we\'re all
Reservists, or bf/gf\'s of the Original Reservist).  Its a yearly thing that
they arrange their leave/ vaction schedules so we can all get together for a
weekend blitz in July or August and keep on with the AD&D game we started.
The game has been running since the summer of 1988.
        You are correct that as the ref, you wind up feeling almost
responsible for the amount of fun your friends have in this situation.
However, its always a great feeling when we get together and I do manage to
surprise \'em or wow \'em with a plot twist.

It was described in CT Adventure 4, _Leviathan_.  From the Library Data:

"Colloquial name for the region to the rimward of the Spinward Marches
consisting of many small empires and independent worlds. The region is
largely unknown to the civilian population of the Imperium, and is
regarded with suspicion by the average citizen due to its being a
natural haunt for corsairs and any who wish to escape Imperial justice.
Many Outrim worlds are believed to have been settled in the great Terran
age of expansion known as the Ramshackle Empire, and since isolated from
other human contact, whilst others have retained links with either the
Imperium or the Zhodani Consulate, some as client states." 

There\'s more info elsewhere in the book, but I\'m not going to quote it
all!

Hudson had to be a PC, since only two players could come up with this

Hudson: "Six weeks?  Man, we\'re not going to last six hours!"

Ripley: "Hudson, this little girl managed to survive a whole lot longer
than six weeks on her own."

In my collection of odd real-life combat, I have the case of a police
officer who got into a shoot out with an armed suspect.  Both combatants
emptyied there weapons, at which time the suspect surrenderd.  The officer
was in the front seat of his patrol car, the suspect in the back seat.  Not
one shot hit.

Which is why we make it clear in ACQ that the system is deadly, and should
only be used for very important combats.

Oddly enough, this what I\'m doing with Lunion..  which will be done soon, I
promise.

Each world is mapped, and each diget of the UWP is expanded to include
details like surface gravity, atmospheric makeup, number ans sizes of
cities, details of governemnet and culture, etc.

Lunion will be a living set of pages, since I plan to keep expanding the

        My Cr0.02.  My FTF-players are currently in a "spin-off scenario"
from Chamax Plague/ Horde.  They encountered one of the sub-light sleeper
ships.  I wasn\'t operating a UN transponder, was *huge* compared to anything
they have ever seen (1200dtons), and generally looking "not made by human
hands".  They started seeing MCr counters rolling at the prospect of
"salvaging" this monster.
        So, they figured out how to get aboard.  They had thier combat
programer "hack" into the ship\'s computer core.  The first warning should
have been when I mentioned thier PLSS units were warning them about
difficulty keeping them warm.  That and the fact that the computer they were
hacking was *helping* them get on board.  So, they managed to shut down the
Molecular Suppresion Field Generator, not really knowing what it did.  All
they knew was that the Ship\'s Computer refused to let them go any further
without it being deactivated.  They walked by several dozen borwn hairy
balls covered in frost at random interrvals throughout the ship;  didn\'t
really examine them much.
        Got themselves all the way down to the engineering deck (bottom of
ship, only *1* route in or out).  By now, the interior hull temp was a balmy
12c.  Which meant the first questing hunter stumbled upon them.  They hosed
it (they all are packing laser rifles, and two NPC\'s have mini-guns).  No
big deal.  Then the second one showed up.  Then 3 & 4.  5,6 & 7.  Now, the
players are getting a little annoyed, so they booby trap the top of the
stairs with a willy-pete charge;  that\'ll burn for 5 mins, and keep the
annoying little acid-spitters at bay.  BOOM goes the charge.
        Bad demo roll;  most of the stairs (the only way OUT) is now plugged
with WP at ~2000c.
        So, of course, the Chamax have started burning through the ceiling
to get to them.  The first one got in to the area and immediately almost
killed one of the NPC Marines.  They hosed it.  They are all making END
rolls to not pass out from heat exhaustion (space suits can\'t bleed heat
very well with that firestorm in the stairs warming the air).  We wrapped
with the group getting ready for the next *two* to jump down in to the room
and the combat porgrammer announcing that the Ship\'s Computer had just told
her there were *300* occupants at time of launch.  There are *12* members in
the team.  They also just managed to turn the Molecular Suppresion Field
Generator back on.
        They are, in the vernacular, intercoursed.  They were repeated given
hints that they should be much more circumspect.  They ignored them.  So, I
am probably going to kill every NPC in the party (1/2 the team, all friends)
and badly injure at least two of the player\'s characters.  But, unless
something goes horribly wrong, I\'ll probably let them escape with thier
hides and a good scare.

        My point ( I do have one) is that this is the first big adventure
for the group, first time we done Traveller in a while.  So, there isn\'t
*any* point in killing them.  The characters won\'t learn anything and the
players will get discouraged.  Slaughtering the NPC compatriots and scaring
the players wittless as they realize how *badly* they misjuged the situation
- - that\'s fair dinkum.  If they make this level of mistake again, then I
might kill on or two characters and slaughter every NPC in the group.  Three
times, and the 1/2 the NPC\'s will live and 1/2 the players won\'t.
        I agree with Cliff\'s premise that if they player\'s characters are
never in mortal danger, they don\'t sweat nearly as much as they ought.
Using NPC\'s as "monster demo subjects" is a great plot device, though, in
terms of driving home that the players are in danger.  Also, from a GM POV,
character creation is disruptive to game flow.  I prefer to avoid it...  but
if they just won\'t listen or start thinking "only the NPC\'s buy it, we\'re
exempt", then its time to drop one or two and let an NPC survive.
        That\'s IMHO, IMTU, YMMV.  YAAA.

A GM has to be an advocate of good gaming.  In our Champions game, the GM
has to be aware that most of the villians we face are much more powerful
than we are.  He could easily wipe the floor with us, but instead makes
sure that each adventure has an "out" we can use to beat the villian.  It\'s
rarely easy, and always has us on the edge of our seats.

>No!  If a player character isn\'t killed or disabled every now and then,

You can have danger without an obligatory death.  If the players know you
consider the killing of their characters part of your job, they\'ll tend to
become less attached to their characters.  Death of a leading character
should be memorable.

Back to the Champions game.  Last August, the character I had played for
four years died.  Gadget started out as an annoying teen hero with an
unearthly ability to build and fix things.  He ended up a cybernetically
enchanced powerhouse.  I really liked and identified with this character.
We were fighting a villian who was trying to gate in a demonic army, and I
had to close a circut on the machine that was going to seal the gate.  The
GM called me into another room to explain that this would kill Gadget.  We
talked it over, and decided that it was best for the story.  So Gadget
grabbed the power cables, and held on just long enough...

William "Gadget" Rathbone, 1976-1998

We had a funeral for him, all the other players read euolgies from their
characters; it was a momentous occassion, and it really hit everyone.
That\'s how a PC death should be.

But as Referee I can just keep throwing more and more stuff at you until I
"win."  Beat my pirates in their 400dt Corsair?  The next bunch has a
3000dt destoyer.  After that, an Azhanti High Lightning.

Gaming is a cooperative venture.  The Referee (or GM, or whatever) stage
manages and directs the action.  The players explore the GM\'s world.  In a
confrontational game like you describe, where\'s the fun?  If you just want
to kill things, might I suggest Melee?

Clif, in my current Traveller/CORPS game, we have gone close to two months
without a gunshot.  Last week, there was a five minute fistfight between
one player and an informant they think is two-timing them.  Sitting in my
in-box are six messages demanding that we go to a weekly schedule of play
rather than my preferred bi-weekly, and several inquiries about various
points in the campaign.

	I think it is important to remember that RPG\'s are as much "G" as RP.   I
really try to avoid cheating either for or against the players in my game.
Recently I\'ve even given up using a Ref Screen and make all combat rolls out
in the open in front of the players and let the chips fall where they may.
People are much more willing to accept the results that way  (and it really
does increase excitement level) when the results of combat are made to seem as
game-like as possible.   The biggest plus is that when the players win at a
combat or series of other oppossed tasks, and they know I would have let bad
things actually happen to the characters if they had failed, they get a bigger
sense of accomplishment or achievement--they "really" have won.

One shot is all I need..

But seriously, a remore gun system might be the answer.  I set up the
weapon, scuttle off about 50m with the command unit (connected by a
fibre-optic cable) and take my shot from that position.

Now, we all know the official story - the recent movie did a better than

notice our EM signature rising and sent a scout to investigate. Alas, as
the poor scout was sneaking in, their sensor op failed to notice
(Spectacular Failure on the task roll - under any system!) this small
non thrusting  ship leaving the primary world. 

Now space is big and it\'s really unlikely, but this poor little scout
ship clipped the side of the aluminum can we called a service module.
The crew of Apollo 13 were too busy trying to figure out what happened
to look right out the window, while they rushed to stabilize their
orbit. 

Meanwhile the Vilani scout is sent tumbling by this and in a moment of
irrational dfear that they are under attack they attempt to jump out -
way too deep in the gravity well...

A month or two later, when they haven\'t returned, the local governor
puts an interdiction on this strange little place and sends a report up
the chain. Said report is lost in the mists somewhere, so the central
authorities never hear that there is a problem until a century later at
a little mining outpost next to an interdicted world...

Just a passing fancy...

IIRC, there weren\'t any official Consulate states in the Void, but there 
*were* Zhodani client states and trading partners.  Even Imperial traders 
roamed outside the frontier looking for new places, new people, and a quick 
way to make a buck.

Hmm...requires miniaturized teleportation. Teleportation is <riffle riffle
riffle> officially \'?\' Tl according to FFS1. Other souces place it at TL21
(iirc). That\'s for basic stuff. Putting it in a man-portable device would be
at least one or two TL\'s higher.

If someone\'s running around your Trav Universe with a TL-23 gun, you have
bigger problems than being shot with teleportation rifles. Namely, just
exactly how do you catch and kill that munchkin.

Of course, a man portable meson rifle would do the same thing...that\'s _only_
Tl 17 or so, but requires really precise shot placement, since it only does a
tiny amount of damage. (quite enough, however, if that damage is occuring _in_
the targets frontal lobes ;-)

This only if you don\'t have minimum tunnel lengths for meson weapons.

The only version of the deckplans I ever saw was in FASA\'s Adventure Class

The plans were for the Lurushaar Kilaalum Type T Patrol Cruiser.  This was
put together by the Keith brothers John Harshman and a few others whose
names fall back in the mists of Traveller antiquity, so as far as I am
concerned it was official.

At Trav-TL 12 it is possible to make a handgun with the following stats.

Dam:     6
Recoil:  2
Wt:      2.12 kg
Length:  28 cm

I designed at the request of my brother who was rolling (or role-ing) a 
law enforcement/agent type character while watching the film 
Bladerunner for a sort of X files/Dark skies adventure Im about 
to run (begining on Regina). 

If you have seen Bladerunner then you might remember the gun Harrison 
Ford uses in the movie. Its a very large calibre magnum automatic 
pistol (with a barrel to rival a shotgun). Of course my brother wanted 
something like this so I obliged (with a *WEG_).

If anyone is interested in stats then I will gladly post it to the list.

I\'ve seen that one, and thought it good enough...and I\'ll admit it was

_Signal GK_ (Sub Liner),  _Traders and Gunboats_ (Scout Ship,

Licensed or not, it\'s not as well-known or as popular as the GDW

help make GT: Starships popular, if well done.

Well, given that one of my players (R.D.E.) may well be posting summaries of
our sessions from now on, I thought I\'d get people caught up to date and get
my cr.02 in before I get slandered all to H*ll and back.

The Reavers\' Deep campaign (for lack of a better name) has been going on for
some time now, ~8 sessions (on a once per two weeks basis that is good for
peoples\' schedules but often leaves me jonesing on the off-weeks, like this
one).  I will attempt to (relatively) briefly summarize all that has come
to-date, before I forget it all.  If any of my players note any omissions or
mistakes, feel free to correct.

Comments welcome.

(In the future I may well just post this nonsense on a web page with the
deckplans and other sundries, but for the moment I am too lazy to do even
rudimentary HTML coding.)

I am using the Megatraveller rules system, the setting is the Reavers\' Deep
sector (slightly modified), and the starting date was 200-1080.


Cast of Players/Characters:

Gstag Khiianu Averglaard, former Imperial Marine combat medic played by
Famille Spofulam\'s own (no one else wants him) Roderick Darroch Elliott, who
had better learn that dictaphones are *not* for recording and playing back
belches at a variety of speeds before a game session.  (For those who might
get garbled ascii, that\'s two u\'s, two umlauts in his first name.)

Mustapha Shakui Berenghi Jones, former, well, Pirate (who had a very brief
stay in the scouts before being kicked out for being too lax and unruly for
even them), ship\'s Pilot and (recently) Captain. Played by the TML\'s own
Glenn Grant.

Umgigish \'Gigi\' Ensishuu, former Scout, notably \'rugged\' (I include this at
her insisistence) and somewhat bouncy (I include this to annoy her, on the
off chance she reads it), played by Melissa Frankel, who none of you have
been unduly exposed to to my knowledge.

Recent Addition:
Hfostyakl\'aha (Hfost), Aslan outcast played by occasional TML lurker Jason
Jones. Has yet to master Anglic, despite his best efforts to-date, but this
is likely a good thing, since if he fully understood what was going on
around him. . . .

Recent Subtraction:
Baron General Shugash Hault-Shigushii, retired backwater Army general from
Dareesh (Reavers\' Deep 3012 with a slightly modified UWP in order to make it
properly banana republic-esque and tropically scenic) whose family interests
got the whole show rolling.

And a cast of NPCs who will be introduced as needed. . . .


Actually, my fingers are tired, so just save this character summary and I\'ll
post more later, so it stays nice and small-ish.  Players who read this list
are welcome to post character writeups, especially Jason, whose Aslan is
pretty nifty.  Darroch and Glenn are, as expected, just bizarre.

You don\'t seem to get my point.  Players tend to treat their characters as
grossly expendable because they don\'t feel the pain when their character
gets hurt.  This is the idea that the sub-mastermind in "Never Say Never
Again" was fighting when he invented that 2-Player World Domination game
that would give you an electronic shock proportional to the loss you
suffered.

The only OTHER way I can think of to keep some players from treating their
characters as expendable is to rule that they cannot play the rest of the
campaign, if they die.  Few GMs are willing to enforce this, preferring
rather to allow the player to roll up another character...  This, in effect,
gives a player 1000 lives.  Some OTHER way to make the player "feel the
pain" must be devised.

The pot is not meant to be a bribe to make players play.

Hmm, well, if there was a "pot" of money in the scenario, then it might be a
darn good way to bring in the element of betrayal.  :)  Ricky sounds like a
shrewd player-killer.

One of the best campaigns I was even in involved a bunch of us characters
chasing the Dupont Emeralds across the galaxy in 2300AD.  The bunch of
emeralds got halfed and it prompted an on-going mini-battle between two
player characters trying to kill each other through several locales.  It was
a great source of comic relief.

I will attempt to provide the campaign background in this installment.

Members of the insignificant little Aslan clan Taaufyarea\'ailea (located on
Ktao\', a meaningless little world located in subsector H of the Ealasiyaw
(sp?) sector of the Aslan Hierate (E464505-5 Ag, Ni 631 As F1V, M5D) have an
abundance of a natural resource, the (I forget what unpronounceable Aslan
name I gave it so insert one here) plant, whose essence, when properly
extracted and refined, is a major component of anagathic medicines.

While this has been known for some time, the Taaufyarea\'ailea have not had
the resources or industrial base to do anything useful with it, and so have
tentatively decided to partner with outsiders.  Given that they are
currently feuding with the more important Aslan clans in the area, it is
decided to work instead with their eventual market (Imperial humanity) by
forming a partnership with the Shigushii family (hereditary rulers of
Dareesh, and a small but thought to be up and coming mercantile concern in
the region).  (The Caledonians were consciously bypassed due to their
connections to certain larger Aslan concerns, and because Sebastien made an
Imperial Noble sort.)

Thus was formed the fledgeling Shigushii-Taaufyarea, LIC (say that three
times quickly, I dare you!). The first voyage to Ktao\' to finalize the
agreement, deliver a gift of a hold\'s worth of Dareeshi brandy (much prized
by the Aslan) and pick up the first holdful of

Dareesh was entrusted to Baron Shugash Hault-Shigushii, a recently-retired
little despot of a noble with fierce facial whiskers, old-fashioned ideas
about nobility and propriety and some sense of the Aslan mindset. (The fact
that he was technologically indifferent and had no useful starship skills
were seen as being a plus under the circumstances.)

Ol\' Shugash procured a starship, the MV Sobrendl, a somewhat rundown Type AP
Frontier Trader (TL-13, 200td Jump-3, 1G, 70-odd tons cargo and cramped
quarters for all concerned) and hired a crew consisting of the first three
player characters (Guustag, Mustapha and Gigi), as well as a pair of gunners
(to be detailed next post) and a solidly experienced merchant First Officer
NPC to be his captain.

Then it was off to the planet Lhshami (Reavers\' Deep 2111) to pick up their
Taaufyarea partner, an Aslan by the name of Khye\'ailea who would serve as
cultural attach and business partner.

Play began with the Sobrendl jumping into the Lhshami system on 200-1080,
where I will pick things up next post....

Yeah, yeah, pat yourself on the back. Means nothing to me to hear you toot

What is the average result of a firefight in an enclosed space?  Why don\'t
you write the FBI and ask them?  Besides, I thought I was advocating injury,
also, when I said "disabled", but that\'s what happens when someone is bent
on arguing against someone they have decided they don\'t like, rather than

This would put Dareesh in the middle of Nightrim.  That\'s a full blown Impie 
area.  Thing is, I have it as:

Fair enough, but your conclusions are always after the fact.  Its not my
fault that most movies are predictable.

How about the PC in "Mission: Impossible".  How many people knew that one of
the movie\'s bigger names, Emilio Estevez, was going to be lobotomized in the
elevator shaft?  That took me greatly by surprise.

Guess what?  Ms. Kensington, a PC in the first movie, is going to be offed
on page 7 of the sequel to "Austin Powers".  I guess you\'ll tell me that she
was an NPC, now, just \'cause Austin Powers shagged her?

Sorry, but I don\'t believe in running Trav campaigns that seem like they\'re
really \'Toon campaigns, where you can keep from falling from heights simply
because you never studied law.

We\'ve already been over that line of thought, exhaustively.  (Peanut
Gallery:  "You can say that again!")  The GM didn\'t have a copy of the
sheet?  Did the player take all memory of the character from the GM\'s mind
when he left?  The player is powerless to effect a change in the GM\'s
universe unless he so wills it.


And the point has been made and agreed upon that a good GM will allow
players to effect realistic levels of change in his universe.

Right!  And that latter option is realistic.  Given the option of going to a

and hoof it to Canada rather than dive in like a Klingon whose courage has
been challenged.

Yes.

Make no mistakes.  I\'ve never had to deify myself or any of my GM\'s, because
it was always ASSUMED that the GM was the "god" of his universe.  We never
had a problem with the idea because we were all of the old school that had
been raised up on the idea that the GM ... etc.

>(BTW, this has nothing to do with GMs who are portraying the roles of
Gods in their FRPGs.  That\'s a role usually portrayed by the GM, and
as such, is outside the scope of this discussion.  Shouldn\'t be used

I disagree, totally.

>I, too, believe in Role-Playing over ROLL-Playing.  However, I\'ve

Remembering that the character is a ultimately a piece of paper is
reminding myself that I\'m here to play a game and have fun, not

I agree.  It is sadly humourous to watch a couple of nerdy gamers get into a
one-upmanship thing over rules specifics.  That\'s one reason I like to
rework systems, so that players will never get into an argument about the
workings of the universe which should mostly be a mystery, anyway.  It sucks
to have players who can recognize every monster they meet because they own
every manual, module, etc.  The most fun I ever had was being a 1st level

scared the crap out of them!  AS WELL THEY SHOULD!


Monsters should be scary.  Guys with guns should be, too.

OK. This is a translation of Ditzie\'s notes on the subject.

It wont be man-portable, even in battledress.

Base it around a densitometer and a small meson gun. The densitometer has
been done a large number of intensive sweeps around the area. It would help
if furniture etc in the area is very light - think foam. The computer
linked to the units knows *exactly* where everything in the ship or complex
is, and how much it masses.

The meson gun should only need to be about 20cm long, as it needs a range
of under a kilometer. Make it as wide as you want - you probably want over
a megajoule of output.

Now, people arent that massy, but battledress is. The odds are that an
unarmoured person wont be picked up by the densitometer, but a clam would be.

Hmmm, can I smell an Imperial Marine adventure ... there is a mad scientist
in the complex, and he has a meson gun and has smoked fourteen troopers so
far.

There are combat robots as well ... you need to go in, find him and kill
him. And the closest small Meson Screen is five parsecs away.

Yes, and I qualified this exception.  I "guess" you missed it.  I made the

Wrong.  The abandoned PC\'s can become "pre-rolled characters" and the GM can
provide the background and resume the game where it left off.

Indeed, but Dareesh was created by the player *before* I found the subsector
data for RD, and so when I did turn the stuff up (kindly sent me buy the guy
doing up the lost Keith supplements) I found a likely candidate and plugged
it in.

By the way, since I didn\'t have any kind of map of the sector either, I have
made one (on a macro scale) wil Illustrator.  It isn\'t finished yet, as I
haven\'t put in asteroid/desert world symbols or borders/jump routes, but
when I do I\'ll put it on the site that I will eventually make for this
damned campaign. . .  ;)

In any event, given the players, mayhem is imminent.  ;)

Well, Cliff, if it was so obvious perhaps you should have indicated that
this is what you meant. Upon reading your message it didn\'t seem like such a
concept was obvious to you. In fact, it seemed like you were saying the
opposite.

Here\'s a thought:

If you post a message to the list, and you must "constantly...explain"
perhaps, just perhaps, your language wasn\'t as specific as you think it was.

>"severely wounded" sounds like my kind of danger, to me.  Don\'t see how

Mark Twain once pointed out that the difference between the right word and
the almost right word was like the difference between lightning and a
lightning bug.

It\'s the same with death. You were saying PCs have to die frequently in
order for danger to be maintained. The difference between "severely wounded"
and "dead" is like the difference between the right word and almost right
word.

Clif:

The following is from your post "Re: GMing Philosophy...", on Friday, 12
Feb 99, at 12:07 PM:

*********

I\'ve wondered if players shouldn\'t put an admission fee into the pot,
along
with the GM\'s reward, all as a deterrent, so that players will FEEL the
pain.  All players who survive to the end of the adventure would get a
cut
of the pot.  Maybe then players wouldn\'t go sauntering into a hail of
fireflies as if it was Disney World.

*********

The reference to "...along with the GM\'s reward" implies a reward either
_for_ the GM (presumably in gratitude for running the game) or _from_
the GM (given to the players).  Since the context of this paragraph
revolves around admission fees, and the doling out of same to players
whose characters survive, "the GM\'s reward" logically must be similarly
tangible.  Hence, either the players are bribing the GM to let them play
(using the first meaning described above), or the GM is paying players
to participate (using the second meaning).

Have I failed to read what you wrote, or have you failed to make clear
your meaning?

ObTrav:  <tongue-in-cheek> How many of the "101 Religions" mention
tithing, and have any referees considered simulating this with _real_
cash payments to the local stand-in for the deities in question (i.e.,
the referee)? </tongue-in-cheek>

OK, we\'ll get realistic.

In _The Traveller Adventure_, the characters are likely going to need to
break in to a museum to recover the howood artifact that is the centerpiece
of the campaign.  Odds are that even if the characters manage to pull off
the caper without being caught (museums are designed to keep the items
inside), I\'m willing to bet that they\'ll leave enough evidence behind that
a competent TL-12 cop will be able to build a case.  "But we\'ll be long
gone!" you say.  Hardly.  The local authorities might just insist on a
detailed check of all departing ships.. especially ones that ask for a
sudden departure date.  And being a Subbie Merchant that is suddenly taking
free time just after a major robbery.. hmm.. sounds like reasonable cause
for a search warrant, which will turn up the Vargr who started the whole
thing.

Reasonable danger puts the ship\'s crew in a penal colony for three-to-five.
 Grab Adventure 8.

Realistic is that most people never own or draw a gun.  70% of FBI agents
never fire their weapons in anger.  Even in states where it\'s legal to
carry concealed weapons, most people don\'t want them on private property.

Realistic depends on the style of the campaign.  Are they mercenaries?
Fine, people die in combat, and for stupid reasons.  Are they merchants?
Merchies should avoid combat, as it tends to lower the profit margin.
Spies?  Despite Hollywood\'s best intentions, espionage is not combat
intensive.  

Have you tried other form of threat?  Losing a ship, or other financial
ruin is always a good push in a Traveller campaign.

clif, I\'m amazed that you even have to make a finacial incentive.  My
friends and I play for love of gaming, and each other\'s company.  We don\'t
even keep track of who owes what for pizzia.

True Story:  Back in \'95, when I was in the hospital after my cancer
surgery, a group from the local game store came in with Paranoia.  I was on
serious morphine, in a lot of pain, and I was laughing so hard my nurse had
to keep reminding me about my staples.  It wasn\'t about winning, it was
about playing a game.

Gee.  Y\'know, I really shopuld be nicer to Kirsten\'s character them seeing

like all the others.. fairly.

I would really question a GM who openly accepts bribes.  What if you have a
player who can\'t afford to feed you?

In my games, I ask that people help provide munchies if I\'m providing the
space.  Sometimes we have a full meal, and I ask folks to help pay for the
cost of feeding them (never more than a buck or two).  I would *never* give
out favorable circumstances in the game for real-world favors.  That is the
height of Referee munchinkism.

Read the book.  Really.  Explaining them would ruin the fun.

One hint:  When Steven Barnes (one of the co-authors) saw _Jurrasic Park_,
he descibed the Velocioraptors as "kind of like Grendels, but slower.."

Me too!

I had the distinct misfortune of having a serious idiot lead a brand new 
player into a near lethal situation and expose him to some serious 
"Don\'t go that far" dangers. I ended up incapaciting both of them, and 
pulling the newbe aside during an immediate break and arranged to allow 
him to return to the game with another available character.

he learned to not be quite so trusting the next time.

    'body' => '		I think the attitudes about whether the GM is opposing the players or  not
depends upon when in the game you are playing.  When encounters are set up and
planned or created in response to player action, the GM should make sure there
is an "out" for the players and that the encounters are balanced with a chance
of success.  This is the "RP" or story-telling element of the session.  Once a
dangerous or combat event actually begins the GM should play the "bad guys" to
win, should be scrupulous in following the rules and should be honest in
reporting the die rolls--this is the "G" or game part of the session.
	RPG\'s were developed out of miniatures wargaming.  People wanted reasons and
consequences to go along with the battles they fought on the tabletop.   The
combination of "play-acting" with wargaming was a powerful one, and it is best
if you remember that the combination is the heart of the hobby.  
	Once the bullets start flying, I like to get out the miniatures or counters
and treat the game like a small wargame until the battle or crisis is
resolved.  So yes I curse when my Bushwhackers roll a critical failure when
the PC\'s are in line of sight.  But, once the fighting is over, I don\'t want
to "get revenge" on the players for beating my precious cutthroats, that
"game" is over and the role-playing resumes and I\'m on the PC\'s side again.
	In some Traveller campaigns it even works to have one player run the enemy
forces during battles.  If you have a combination Space/Ground mercenary unit,
for instance the player running the space captain can easily be Ground
Opposing force guy, for playing out the fire fights, and the Ground Commander
can be Space Oppossing force guy for running the space battles.     And yes
you expect the guy running the opposing forces to try to win the encounter!
Hopefully, you\'ve balanced things right or the PC\'s as a group have planned
adequately enough to ensure the PC\'s will win, but if they don\'t that\'s
life--as long as they know it\'s fair.

Kha Shuskugu, a young and somewhat bruised-around-the-edges gunner, formerly
a Pirate on the Rose Nocturne (a corsair she served on with Mustapha). 
Think Juliette Lewis in space; kinda low-rent, but interesting nonetheless.

Matthias Edikin, an imposing and thoroughly competent gunner/engineer\'s
mate, former Imperial Navy NCO.

Diisham Kalim, former Merchant First Officer, hired by the Baron to serve as
captain and actually run things while the latter makes the \'strategic\'
examples.


200-1080 - the Sobrendl jumps into the Lhshami system on the way to a
rendezvous with their contact Khye\'ailea the following day.  On their way
insystem, are warned by an outbound trader that, with the system\'s lone SDB
(no GG, by the way) currently undergoing repairs that there have been
reported sightings of a nasty-seeming corsair, the Random Heading.

Arriving at the Lhshami downport (a teeming city of 20 million inhabitants,
fully one-third of the planet\'s inhabitants) the Baron authorises an entire
floor of the prestigious Lhshami StarTowers be reserved for group use.  Much
use of hot tubs and minibars ensued, with the disappointed males discovering
that there were more than one hot tub, and that there were \'privacy screens\'
(opaque holograms) seperating them as needed (narrowly maintaining Mr.
Miller\'s morals clause on this occasion).

Following this, the Baron shelled out for eveningwear for Kha and Gigi, who
went nuts, and the group spent the evening dining and gambling on a big
floating complex drifting over the lovely fungal forests of Lhshami.  The
Baron lost a gentlemanly large sum at a game of skill, Mustapha made out
moderately well (with really lucky rolls) on one game of chance, while Gigi
lost steadily at a low-stakes game of chance apparently involving the
movements of some cute little rodent that she wanted to shoot by the end of
the night. Gstag spent the evening trying not to make eye contact with any
attractive women, and so pick them up (ask Darroch, it\'s long and
complicated)....

The group then returned to the suite, being scheduled to meet Khye\'ailea the
following morning for breakfast.  Most of the group decided to get a few
hours\' sleep, but Kha, Gigi and Gstag decided to see who could out-drink
who (Scout vs. Marine honour being at stake here).  Kha outdrank them both
but was too sleepy in the morning to be presentable.  The other two woke up
in time to be fashionably late, and arrived wired on a stimulant Gstag
prescribed to wake them up, so they jittered through the encounter (and of
course violated the morals clause all to hell in the proess).

The Baron\'s cultural attach/business partner turned out to be a young
(anagathics!), reserved, stunning Aslan woman who delicately ate a breakfast
of the equivalent of prosciutto (spice-cured, raw, thinly-sliced meat) while
utterly captivating the Baron and Gstag.  Culturally Aslan, physically a
stauesque human female.  It seems the Aslan figured that though she was a
relatively minor executive in the Taaufyrea\'ailea fold, her outward humanity
might prove helpful in this.  They were right, though being utterly Aslan on
the inside she missed a lot of the mooning going on around her...(her
ignorance thankfully preventing further morals violations).

Before leaving, Mustapha ran into an old \'acquaintance\' now working aboard
the Random Heading, who inquired briefly as to his situation and promised to
pay a gambling debt he owed the redoubtable Mr. Jones.

They prepared to take off for their next leg of the journey to Ktao\', with
the Baron deciding to save a few cents and have the ship ocean refuel. 
Given that the Engineer was racked, the Pilot hung-over and everyone else
queasy, they did OK and departed.

Wherever it started, this kind of mindset on the GM\'s part tends to
reinforce it.

The only OTHER way I can think of to keep some players from treating their
characters as expendable is to rule that they cannot play the rest of the
campaign, if they die.  Few GMs are willing to enforce this, preferring
rather to allow the player to roll up another character...  This, in effect,
gives a player 1000 lives.  Some OTHER way to make the player "feel the

GM: You see 500 blood-crazed barbarians. The strange magnetic field
in this area is still making your laser rifles misfire, and the undetectable
atmospheric taint spoiled the gunpowder in all your bullets. What do you
do? Too late, they jump on you and (die roll, die roll, die roll, die roll)
rip you to shreds. You\'re dead, which means you\'re out of my campaign.
Good night.
Players: You do realize that we\'re the last people playing in your campaign,
don\'t you? You sent everyone else away when your Voorg Monster
ambushed them last night.
GM: No problem. The campaign is more important than the players
anyway. Excuse me, I have to make some rolls for my barbarians, they\'re
fighting over your stuff. (Die roll, die roll, die roll....)

You don\'t have to hand a guy a new character every thirty seconds, you
know. There is a happy medium...for example:

The player has to sit out until a logical place for another character to enter
occurs, or take over one of the lesser NPC\'s. Instead of playing the
Hotshot Pilot he designed, he has to take over the Tempermental Cargo 
Hand, or the Pacifistic Ship\'s Doctor...or have to sit out the entire evening 
until the party is back at base and heads to the Guild House to try and 
replace their dear, departed Hotshot Pilot.

"Minimaxed" means that the character is built to take the highest possible
advantage of the game system. He\'ll carry the weapon that does the most
damage, have the skills that make him the most dangerous...if your game
has things like disadvantages-for-points in it, he\'ll pick ones that give him
the most points for the least pain rather than ones that define who he is
or why he does what he does. He won\'t be built to be a character, he\'ll
be built to be as efficient as possible. 
MINI-mum limitations + MAXimum capabilities = MINIMAX.

Clif, make up your mind. PC\'s survive something that should have killed

Every post you\'ve made advocates putting the players in their place so

Just an example of campaigns that didn\'t need character death to make

in thinking that death would be unusual. Justice, Inc ranged from
Indiana Jones to Film Noir (dark detective movies), so the fear of death
varied in that case. Irrelevant, because my point is that death is the
last big stick - if you\'ve gotten to the point where it\'s the only motivator

character carried out the cold-blooded vengeance murder of a supervillain.
Or have Jean T. tell you  how she wept with rage when Chimera killed
Doctor White - because it meant he took the secret of her character\'s

Player involvement, to the point of major emotional response...without

Yeah, he was pretty crazy, but I think the Carrera lady was the sadist.  You
might be right, though.  I\'ll have to pay attention next time and see what I
see.  But the point is that when the stakes were raised in the game, the
stakes were raised in real life.  If players agree to put money in the pot
at the risk of losing it if their character dies, then why not?  It would be
interesting to see if it works, rather than poo-pooing it just because I
posed the idea.

In fact, players of Magic at the local comic shop DO compete for money.  Do
you regard Magic as strictly a mere card game?  I don\'t know, myself, since
I\'ve never played it, but it seems to have some kind of element of character
attachment to it.

people are putting words into your mouth, etc) a point a dozen times,

point stated and restated to the point of it being what you meant to say,
you\'ve got to realize that it takes time for all your words to get to all the

For future reference:  You can always rule that the "ship explodes" crit
leads (in some cases) to an effect similar to what generally happens to
a villian\'s island base in a James Bond movie.  The ship is wracked by a
series of explosions, each worse than the last, culminating in the Big
Bang.  This gives the PCs and some of the NPCs a chsnce to hit the
lifepods before everything goes away.  As an added benefit, it gives the
referee a chance to engage in some good descriptive narrative, as the
ship goes through its death throes.

Actually, being on potent narcotics is an effective means to simulate
the Alpha Complex setting (Personality Stabilizing Drugs, anyone?). 
Come to think of it, being in a lot of pain is also effective in evoking
that Alpha Complex Feeling.

I\'d be willing to bet, though, that the therapeutic effect of enjoying a
good gaming session far outweighed the risk of pulling a few staples
loose. 

ObTrav:  Are RPGs still played in the eras of Traveller?  If so, you
could end up with a serious infinite regress....

On their way out-system, the Sobrendl is (of course) intercepted by the
Random Heading (corsair, see previous post) who \'reasonably\' demand only the
ship\'s cargo (it\'s contents having been determined by Mustapha\'s old buddy
while they were in port).  (This might well have been influenced by the fact
that the Sobrendl was lightly armed (1*blaser, 1*sandcaster), and I figured
the pirates wouldn\'t want to risk having their ship suffer a lucky shot that
might cost too much to repair to be worth the effort.)

To this Mustapha silently gave the referee a dirty, knowing look; the Baron
sputtered about the cheek of it all, and how unsporting he found the whole
idea (before heading off to the hold with Gstag to investigate what kind
of man-portable mayhem he and Dar, er, Gstag had secreted away in the
event of a boarding action), Gigi cheerfully mentioned that she had some
breeching charges in engineering (?!?  I _have_ to pay better attention to
characters\' starting equipment!) while they eventually surrendered to the
inevitable and pushed most of the Dareeshi brandy out the hold for the
Random Heading to pick up at leisure (the captain of which knew the type of
characters he was dealing with, and wasn\'t going to board for love or
money).

The crew, lightened by fifty-odd tons of booze, then proceeded off to
jumpspace, sulking all the way.

Someone had to explain this to Khye\' (for short), and it sure as heck wasn\'t
going to be Mustapha, who kept a low profile.

I would expect that Guinness would still be brewed by appointment for
HRM the King/Queen.  Why should a few millenia of strife and war prevent
the continuation of the House of Windsor, or a successor House, upon the
throne?

BTW, what kind of barbarians would want Guinness in _cans_?

holiday cheer and whatnot, the Baron/Sebastien Normandin informed me that he
couldn\'t keep playing due to increased external demands on his time (PhD
combined with T.A.ing combined with, well, other stuff) and an old friend,
Jason Jones signed on.  Rather than force the Baron on him (*not* compatible
personality types), he rolled up an Aslan male gunner with an interesting,
checkered past and put his fate in my hands.  Also, Melissa (Umgigish) was a
last-minute no-show due to miscommunication, so I had to juggle a bit.]

The Sobrendl lurched out of jumpspace in Reavers\' Deep 1810, a depressing
little vacuum backwater rock half the size of our moon that serves as home
to about 3,000 independent prospectors (two local planetoid belts) and,
presumably, to all kinds of scum and villainy and shuddered with an impact
that, among other things, knocked out the inertial compensators, sending
bodies everywhere.  The Baron was tossed around and seriously injured, the
captain (Diisham) had been in the process of heading into his acceleration
couch in the cockpit and broke his neck (fluke), Umgigish banged her head
hard enough to lose consciousness (mean referee), Kha sustained internal
injuries, Khye\' banged her head hard enough to befuddle herself, and
everyone else was more or less OK.

While Gstag tended the wounded (dropping Diisham into a low berth so he
wouldn\'t rot, and Kha and the Baron there until medical assistance was at
hand), Edikin managed to get the inertial compensators back online and the
lasting damage was assessed: loss of the ventral (offensive) turret, and
damage to enough of the ventral jump grid to assure a misjump or worse if
left untended.  Best guess was a collision with a small asteroid nearly
matching the Sobrendl\'s course and speed.  Cosmic fluke (and much glaring by
the players as they calculated the truly, well astronomical odds of same).

Their maneuver drives were unaffected, so they limped into port and began
making inquiries about the possibility of repairs (hah!).  A day or so
later, who should hop into port but the Random Heading?  (The poor pirate
was rather dishevelled, however; it seems that mere hours after pillaging
the Sobrendl they suffered the attentions of the Lhshami SDB, which had
faked the extend of its damage in order to catch the pirate by surprise.)

Ascertaining that the corsair\'s powerplant was shut down and that there was
radiation contamination (among other less pressing problems), the players
immediately started scheming for revenge.  For some reason, they considered
assaulting and taking over the entire system (reasoning that with 3,000
miners dispersed through it how hard could it be?) until Mustapha,
surprisingly playing the voice of reason, suggested that 1-why in H*ll would
they want to try this and 2-as a known hangout of scum and villainy (and
that\'s just the players!), perhaps the local administration had already
considered this possibility and were prepared for it.

At this point it got late, and so we ended it there, with Gigi just coming
to with one H*ck of a headache and looking in dismay at the disarray her
ship was in....

Yes, in high-tech and high-magic type settings the difference is often a

Fair enough. I\'m not going to disagree here!

This seems a bit harsh but you could wait until the next gaming session
to let them bring their new PC\'s into the campaign.

It would be nice if the players were roleplaying the _charecters_ as
people who do not want to die [most people don\'t] and who therefore show
some restraint in their actions however if this is not the way your
players choose to behave so be it.

How about setting up the system so that players whose charecters die &
who have to generate new ones end up with PC\'s who are _inferior_ to the
PC\'s they just lost.  There are three ways to do this 1) penalize 2nd
and future charecters during charecter generation  [limit their stats,
number of terms served, available services and races, whatever] or 2)
give player charecters sufficient rewards [experience, cash, social
position, really big guns, Ancient Artifacts, whatever it takes to make
your PC\'s happy - AD&D does this with levels which is a bit
munchkinistic but it does seem to work some of the time] so that old
PC\'s are _better_ than new ones [the easiest way to do this is to
arrange for the party to get CR 200,000 or so each, it is not enough
money to buy a ship or make big repairs to an existing one so you have
not really limited your plot options much but it is enough more than
typical cash at mustering out to make the older, richer, charecter
"better"] 3) as a GM ensure that new player charecters get less "screen
time" than established player charecters.  If their PC\'s get to do less
the players will have less fun & will therefore have a good reason to
keep the old PC\'s alive.  [Strategy 3 may not seem "fair" but
established charecters have more backgroungd that can be used as plot
hooks anyway and if it gets better players seems acceptible.]

Fair enough. I\'m not going to disagree here!

Personally though, I find wounds like that add character to the...
character.

That\'s what I call dedicated.  : )  I have a pretty broad base of RPG\'ing
experience since 1981 or \'82, so I don\'t need to be reminded that games are
for having fun.

I\'ve never played Paranoia, but I have heard it is a barrel of laughs.

The old copy of Call of Cthulhu I have doesn\'t even have _rules_ for

I agree that as presented it was way too easy for amateurs (the players) to
break into the museum and steal the artifact. However, let\'s assume they
make good on the initial getaway.

Being rank amateurs in thievery they leave behind lots of evidence (DNA,
fibres, etc...). What can the police do with this? Unless Aramis IYTU is an
intrusive police state, the characters DNA profiles will not be in the
poice records. Nor will the fibre signitures of their clothing.

The police would be suspicious of Gvoudzon - he created a disturbance at
the museum about the stolen artifact sometime in the previous few days. But
who is he? The museum staff threw him out without calling the police or
taking his name or fingerprinting him ;^> They will have a description,
e.g. \'very hairy\'.

Closing the starport and searching all outbound ships is a ludicrous
precaution for an item of relatively little value. The police have better
things to do than stake out the starport (and the rest of the city) with
enough personnel to spot a non-descript Vargr just because the museum
director is upset. (The brooch is valuable/important only to the Kforuzeng
and Gvoudzon. The museum bought it from a pawn shop for pity\'s sake.)

There are possibly hundreds of subsidized merchants on the Aramis Trace
(disclaimer: i cannot find a map which shows how many worlds are on the
Aramis Trace). Why associate one performing a normal act with a minor
crime? In itself absolutely no cause for a search warrant.

It seems perfectly reasonable that the characters will make an easy escape
from Aramis. They have no connection to Gvoudzon. Gvoudzon is not
identified with the robbery by name, nor is he likely to be the only Vargr
on planet. The brooch is of curiosity value only (as far as anyone other
than the Kforuzeng knows) and the break-in is a minor crime.

However, you can have fun with the consequences. The characters\' DNA
patterns will now be in the Leedor police database associated with an
unsolved minor crime. Depending on how integrated/cooperative the police
forces IYTU are, the information could also be in the Aramis police
database and in the police databases of neighbouring worlds as they get
X-boat updates. If they get arrested in an alerted jurisdiction which is
controlling enough to take identification samples for the crime committed
(or suspected), they will pop up in the routine check as wanted in Leedor
on Aramis for break-and-enter and theft (and possibly customs evasion).
Something fun to drop on the characters after they\'ve forgotten the
original incident ;^>

(ObRealLife (TM): I remember an entertaining day when a bored rookie had
cause to run my name through the integrated police database and got all
excited about getting two pages back until he noticed why i was in the
system. All (most) law officers are. For elimination prints, etc...)

Having played CoC, I suspect that characters are expected to heal
physically during their numerous visits to insane asylums ["asyla"?],
during their bouts of restful and recuperative thumb-sucking in the
fetal position, rocking gently back and forth....  ;-)

I\'d buy that in a snap too.  But they\'ll have to be moved ahead to the GT

True, and that kind of thinking is another reason I recommend lots and lots
of reading to anyone who wants to GM. The kind of pacing you see in a
book is the kind of pacing a campaign should have.

Movies, on the other hand, provide you with the kind of pacing (IMO)
a gaming *session* should have. I\'m not saying you should go from
"Princess\' Ship Attacked By Star Destroyer" to "Death Star Blown Up"
in one evening, but I like my game sessions to feel like things are
moving along at a good clip.

Sometimes one of my cable channels will run serials from the 1930\'s
or 1950\'s. Much of the stuff is hokey, but the way they can break up 
a story is useful to see.

As long as we\'re on serials, let me mention Cliffhangers. The Cliffhanger 
concept is something you should see in the original, especially since so
many of those cliffhanger shticks are unknown to many gamers today.

I love to close an evening with an immediate danger unresolved, it helps 
ensure repeat attendence. It also leaves things on a high note, instead of 
"I\'m tired. Let\'s leave off here and start up next week."

I\'ve yet to have a player show up at a game and ask, "So, where were we?" 
when we left off last time with the entire team facing a horrible fate. <g>

Semi-off topic section follows:

I especially used such cliffhangers in my Justice, Inc. campaign - since
it was pulp adventures, it seemed especially appropriate. Some memorable
times we rolled end-of-session credits:

1) While the heroes\' crippled seaplane fell towards the ocean below, 
a mysterious hostile fighterplane in pursuit.
2) As a giant monster, accumulated from the corpses of those washed
away by a killer flood, reared out of the river before the heroes\' horrified
eyes.
3) As a sedan driven by Boss Murdock\'s thugs pushed the heroes\' car
into the path of an oncoming train.
4) As an evil chinese warlord pulled a lever, dumping those before his
throne down a seemingly bottomless pit. (Yes, the players stood there
in front of the throne and confronted the villain. The looks on their faces
when he pulled the most cliche stunt in cliche villaindom - and succeeded
at it - was something I shall long treasure. It was the moment they totally
realized that they were in the PULPS!! <G>  )

From the looks of it, the RD pages are a direct clone of mine.  I put Traneer 
\'in\' the Confederacy as of about 1120 because they were trying to bail the 
Traneers out (ref: Pilot\'s Guide to Drexilthar).  IMTU, they\'d ceeded some 
territory to the Confederacy, and that\'s where the main starport is now.

Vincit wasn\'t a member due to its proximity to the Duchy of Marlheim; they 
were trying to stay neutral in the \'cold war\' that was heating up between 
these two states and trying not to be in the crossfire.  IMTU, they prefer to 
be friends with the Duncinaens, but it\'s nothing overt.  Typical lone-world 
politics in the Deep...

If you\'re going to stoop to personal insults, I suggest you leave the list.

Permanently.

Your posts now get filtered to the trash heap.

coyn posting (of digest 93 for those keeping score).  So, here are some
comments...

>>>>>>>>>> [snippage of text  re the pre Ancient coyn set - listed below]

Worker     Warrior      Drone       Technician   Sport    Leader
 Void       Soil         Air         Gas          Water    Fire
 Darkness   Cold         Noise       Signal       Heat     Light
 Genesis    Aspiration   Sacrifice   Defeat       Death Achievement
Beast      Mercenary    Voyages     Justice      Chance   Phoenix
Hissayt    Emissyob     Ayvaylk     Bestoy       Nebbay   Hayyarn
 Droyne     Eskaloyt

 I would suggest that Beast is redundant in the face of having a set of
zoological coyns already.  While this set represents \'prey\', many ancient
human "prey" beasts included carnivores such as wolves and bears.  At
least, hunters had to deal with them on a regular basis, and if they killed
one its meat was as good as any other animal.  Droyne would probably have
some fearsome creature depicted on the zoological set, that Grandfather
would later use as the Beast coyn.  Most likely it would be an idealized
representation and not too accurate a depiction of the original creature.

The different animals of the zoo set would have each carried a different
significance, aside from their actual representations.  Like ox, snake, or
wolf do in human cultures.  It might be your lucky day if you ran across a
herd of dimwitted Hissayt, but watch out if you see a Hayyarn pack.  Or, a
particularly low intelligence Worker could be referred to as a Hissayt,
while a cunning warrior could be nicknamed Hayyam.  Of course, you don\'t
want to anthropomorphize when discussing alien psychology...

So if you drop Beast you have a whole in that set.  What do you call it?
Conditional set?  Taking a clue from Tarot, I would include the World,
Eskaloyt, in that set.  Just because of the association of World with
Voyages and Chance, maybe Justice and Phoenix.  But it would fit in the
Genesis, etc., just as well...

Now you have whole in accounting for 2 spares in the 38 coyns set.  I like
the Droyne coyn out alone, symbolizing the unity of the race and its
mastery over fate.  The coyn opposite this should symbolize the opposite,
disunity, the failure of the race over fate.  A chirper, the ultimate
failure and yet the begining, akin to the Fool card in Tarot.  The image of
the Chirper should haunt the Droyne, since the failure to caste would be
akin to humans turning into homo erectus, semi intelligent monsters.  But,
as immature Droyne are basically Chirper, this could also represent
potential, a begining.

BTW , I\'m assuming that Chirpers were known to the preAncient Droyne.
Since casting is linked to civilization, any group that lost civilzation
(isolated on the homeworld somehow, the sublight colonies...) could have
devolved into Chirpers.  Rare, but known.

Since Chirper appear as immature Droyne, this may be hard to visualize on
the coyn.  Perhaps a Chirper holding a well recognized primitive implement,
such as a digging stick (a perverted symbol of the leader spear?) that
might also be similar to young Droyne play sticks (reaching as far as I
can...).


So the changes work out to this

Eskaloyt   Mercenary    Voyages     Justice      Chance   Phoenix


 Droyne     Chirper



 And some suggestions on the design of the coyns
>>>>>
 Air         A white cloud (ie. the outline of a cloud).
Gas         A black cloud (ie. a filled-in outline of a cloud).

 Since Droyne are somewhat avian, I would have Air represented by several
flying Droyne, with \'wind\' lines around them.  For Gas the wind lines are
heavier, almost cross hatching, and the Droyne depicted dropping down,
wings trailing, obviously dying.  Hope can then be the rain cloud.


Just a couple of suggestions...

Joe
