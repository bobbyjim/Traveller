Don\'t know if it\'s cool or not, but we\'ve had a few:

Circles and Sqaures (from an older group): The local moots, referring to
Circlets of Rank and the "Squarishness" of the old-guard nobility.

Fire in the Sky: A full IM Drop Regiment, with 10:1 decoy:trooper pods,
coming in at your position. Derived from Fire in the Hole.

Torching Someone: Taking a PGMP or FGMP to non-BD/non-CbtArmored troops
Melting Him Down: Massed voleys of PGMP or FGMP fire on a BD/CbtArmored
troopie for the realistic overloading of it\'s latent heat capabilities.

Dog and Poni show: Inspection of a scout base or ship by some brass from
"High Up", especially if there are large numbers of Vargr assigned there.
Also applied to nearly any inspections by Brzrk of Antares, who, due to
lack of information, and this GM\'s bent imagination, did time in the IISS.

"Marine Peacekeeping Intervention" once said as MPI, also "Marine
Friendship demonstration": euphamism for Fire in the Sky at the request of
a warrant holder trying to prevent a local government from collapsing as
some delicate negotiations with said local government are coming to a close.

Snake in the Grass: a concealed Type S-1/S-2 Serpent Class acting as the
surface base for an IISS survey team.

Dead Spacer\'s Hot Entertainment: A scouts versus marines brawl that
resolves before the local management decides to call the MP\'s in.
DS Cold Entertainment: Same type brawl, but the MP\'s have arrived.
(NB: The dead spacer is a chain of bars in the marches which caters to
scouts AND marines; Also IMTU, there is a real rivalry going betwixt the
IISS and the IMC)

Forgotten Few: Frozen Watch.
Thawed for retirement: Guys who\'ve decided to request the GM let them take
their last two terms as frozen watch to avoid aging saves, get retirement
pay for 5 terms, and otherwise still be 3 term characters. Also used in
character to refer to guys with more than 4 ribbons for Frozen watch who\'ve
retired. Derogatory.

Cool War: Use of deniable 3rd parties in active aggressions vs a specific
target, generally without actually supporting them. The stuff of which Bk4
campaigns are made.

Bounce Infantry: BD or CA troops with Grav Belts and training to use them,
but not trained for Orbital Drop. Generally do Grav-Belt deploys as HALO
style ops, using the Grave belts as parachutes, and then using bouncing
advances as firing oportunities. IMTU, much more common than Drop Troops.

Emergency Escape Sequence: Triggering the Jump drive without a properly
plotted course from within 100 diameters. A Guaranteed misjump to escape
(usually) "Local Troubles".

Chaplain: Euphamism in Solomani Space for the Politcal Officer and/or open
monitors.

Hivering: Relying on lots of talk alone when a little talk and a decent
bribe will do. Or, alternatively, messing with something that works, in an
attempt to figure out what it does, and preventing it from being useful in
the process.

Saluting: euphamism for a human trying to "speak" hiver-sign. Derogatory.

Basically GURPS Philosphy on resolving skills and tasks is leave it up to

roll acts as a DM on the attack roll. Critical Success trumps non critical
rolls, critical failure always fail.

Several specific systems (combat and magic) have more detailed ways of
resolving skill. Magic comes the closest to the MT system with each task

The GURPS skill system is very rational.

All mental skills are bought in this sequence .5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 
Except for Mental Very Hard which are .5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, etc
All physical skills art bought in this sequence .5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 32

Skills can be Mental or Physical
Mental skills can be Easy, Average, Hard, Very Hard
Physical skills can be Easy, Average, Hard

All skills improved by one at each level of the sequence
Mental or Physical
VH starts at IQ-4
H IQ-3
A IQ-2 
E IQ-1

VH Defaults at -7 to attribute
H Defaults at -6 to attribute
A Defaults at -5 to attribute
E Defaults at -4 to attribute

If you wanted to make a task system for GURPS. The skill level already has
the attribute and skill training factored in. What is left is a table to
give you DMs for the difficulty of the skill, and a time factor.

Note the way those colonial wars ended up, though. The spear-carriers

If your civilization has enough capable bean-counters, then your army
will be backed up by an economy big enough and productive enough
to win the logistical war, and a technology advanced enough to make
it easier. Inventions and innovations don\'t become industries without
bean-counters. Even Thomas Edison had an accountant.

(Though I\'m sure Edison drove his accountant to fits on a regular basis.)

It sounds interesting to me. How about a multiplayer option, with

If both are in the same star system, a real-time chat window is

intelligence network\'s "information net", eventually to reach the

I\'ve never quite worked out how Norris\' fleets got burned so badly.  Sure,
they were stretched dealing with the Vargr and Aslan, and they got into a
brawl with the Vilani, but I would have thought that most of these
engagements would have tended to involve Cruisers or smaller ships.  I
can\'t really see where the Battle squadrons would have suffered the serious
losses that would have occurred to Lucan\'s and Dulinor\'s fleets.

This is important, of course, in that it\'s necessary to explain why Norris
didn\'t succeed in doing an Arbellatra, and thundering into the core once
the big players were exhausted.  (Maybe in the name of Strephon, or even
Avery).

This could, of course, be a possible alternate ending to the Rebellion. 
Norris wasn\'t really part of the game, so it\'s not a case of giving
credibility to any of the jerks who hosed away zillions of lives.  It can
also still permit lots of fun and anarchy, too, as once Lucan and Dulinor
are gone, Norris might feel obliged to negotiate with, rather than fight
the other "Imperial" factions (Margaret, Vland, Daibei, whatever is left of
Antares, and the minor states).  There is still also the problem that the
Imperial economy is shot, so rebuilding worlds, suppressing piracy and
restoring interstellar trade would take decades, or even centuries!  

In other words, all our old friends from the Marches can be found anywhere
in the Imperium, there is still, or once again, an Imperium, and there is
also a swag of minor states, and great chunks of lawless space - what more
do you want?

A problem:  The zillions of Vargr governments would make it hard to get an
agreement of this kind from them.

It could be argued that planet-busting isn\'t charismatic, but then,
*victory* is very charismatic.

It\'s also likely that the Vargr might resort to such weapons if the K\'kree
use them.

On general world-busting:  CT Adventure 4: Leviathan had the "Maneuver of
Ganulph/Ganulf"  (the spelling is inconsistent in the book), where a
world\'s atmosphere, and all life on it, "accidentally" got destroyed during
the Fourth Frontier War.  The commander of the Marine garrison on the world
was posthumously court-martialed, but the war did end very shortly
afterwards....

The other bit of documented Imperial world destruction was the
sterilisation of most of the surface of Ilelish after the Ilelish Revolt. 
There are also more dodgy cases from the bad maps in T4 First Survey, where
worlds like Keshi, ex-capital of the Chanestin Kingdom are shown as having
very low populations.  Personally I think this has more to do with Imperium
Games\' idiocy than OTU reality.

	Here in Montreal, Canada, there was a large church downtown
	that was having trouble making ends meet.  A shopping mall
	was built underneath it, and I presume that the church
	collects royalties of some sort.  It was quite a sight, the
	heavy stone building standing on spindly steel legs in the
	big construction pit.  What sort of construction methods are

	I tried to set up a war-by-mail something like this.  The
	crucial factor in running a Traveller war has to be the
	communication lag, with field commanders having a lot of
	latitude.  I was going to concentrate on the former
	consideration by simplifying the tactics once a fleet
	arrived in a system.  Unfortunately, the game never got
	off the ground, but it would be a great way to test some
	ideas about the composition of fleets, navy strategy, and
	even starship design.  Maybe one day...

        The "Star Trek Writers Guide" is *supposed* to be the canon source
for Trek scripts.  In ST:OS, Roddenberry was fanatical about ensuring it was
followed.  ST:TNG was significantly more lax about its application.

        More serialized programs or works of any kind suffer from continuity
errors.  Some are just less forgivable than others...  =)

Norris had just come out of a the FFW a few years before. I doubt the
fleets would be back to full strength even after 10 years. He also
didn\'t have the corridor fleet in reserve. The Vargr also take double
the fleet assets, than any other foe, to keep them at bay (the
corridor fleet was at double strength for this purpose).

Two things come to mind.  1, he needed his fleets to maintain the security of 
Deneb in the face of increased Vargr pressure.  2, he wouldn\'tve had a legal 
leg to stand on if he\'d tried it, and he was a *stickler* for legality.  
IIRC, Avery was born *after* the assassination.  It would have been tricky 
trying to pass him off as Strephon\'s last surviving heir.  Fairly impossible, 
I\'d think.

True...  But he also had a lot on his plate at home to deal with, and he was

Keep in mind that according to canon Daibei never gave up its own fleets
either, which would mean that it could stand to be a major player in a
non-Virused post-rebellion era. Of course, they may have had to make their
own deals and their own alliances with the Solomani.

Personally? I\'d like a more decentralized and localized pre-rebellion
Imperium. I don\'t mind the feudalism as much as the fact that the Imperium
doesn\'t seem to act like a feudal system.

Actually, to take it a step further, I\'m finding the idea of a Grand
Imperium less and less attractive by the day, and not because of personal
ideology. On one hand, I\'m starting to feel that the Imperium would be much
more difficult to hold together from a strong centralized seat of government
than has been portrayed to this point. On the other hand, I\'m starting to
really like the idea of smaller post-feudal sovereign states that are held
together by a complex web of alliances. Something more along the lines of
Europe on the eve of World War I.

Some problems with this view: It really downplays the concept of the
Solomani as a beastly enemy intent on conquering the Imperium. Instead, the
Solomani become just another state. The Vargr are particularly problematic
though, and I\'m trying to work out their role.

Of course, not only is all of this not canon, it\'s directly anti-canon which
makes me a heretic of the worst sort. ;)

Reasonable realistic fuel consumption is about 100x (4,000 seconds).  If you
wanted to be very optimistic, 10x is probably fair, but in that case you should
consider CG to be mandatory on any ship intended to ever land on a planet,
HEPlaR is far too dangerous to use near other objects.  For close-in
manuevering thrusters (docking and the like), I\'d probably assume that the
HEPlaR thrusters can be tuned down.

Nope.  There\'s a minimum based on gravitational effects.  1 G-hour is

All of these are individual modifiers for specific situations. There is
nothing to demonstrate a systematic approach, graduating the difficulty of
the same skill roll, in the modifiers you\'re quoting above.

I\'ll wait until you have Basic in front of you - I don\'t expect you to give
page refs etc when you haven\'t got the books there!  <g>

It isn\'t, and I never claimed it was. It was intended as an example of a
situation where a character may need to use the same skill, but the task is
inherently harder. However, once the ref has a feel (either from the stats
or from experience) for the difficulty levels built in the system it is
easy to rate tasks using the same skill against each other. Published
adventures etc tend to provide a good baseline.

That isn\'t the only difference. GURPS does not provide any guidance to the
ref for appropriate modifier for different situations. It gives a long list
of individual situations which have differing DMs. This is not a structured
recognition of the fact that tasks can differ in difficulty generally. The
system relies on the developed intuition of a referee; Traveller\'s task
system inherently provides a structure to look at different difficulties
and an intuitive \'verbal label\' for each level of difficulty in a task.
These are tied back to the underlying system.

GURPS provides a single resolution roll, and relies on the referee to add a
DM as they feel appropriate to simulate any task difficulty, plus a whole
list of modifiers for skill and situation. GURPS does not recognise varying
difficlties beyond the referee\'s fiat.

The end effect may be similar, but the underlying structure of the rules
mechanism is fundamentally different. Traveller\'s tasks systems are
designed, some better than others. They recognise that skill rolls may need
to be harder and provide the mechanism to handle this. GURPS has a passing
reference in chapter 12 to a GM setting a skill roll at a modifier but
doesn\'t elaborate on this, certainly not to the extent of providing a
system to do so.

Returning the original discussion - this is a reason that some ex-TNE, MT,
and T4 players find problems with the GURPS system. It may be a *perceived*
problem (and I agree it is simple to resolve) but that doesn\'t stop it
making people reluctant to use GURPS as a system. And that is why *you* get
the perception that people are constantly having a go at GURPS. IMO GURPS
is getting a really smooth ride. Look back two or three years and see the
flack that IG\'s material got. The waters of the TML are deep, placid and
still compared to then.

Personally, I feel the rules are a non-issue. I\'d rather SJG fixed the
Technical Architecture for VEII to fit better with Traveller\'s previous
canon. And switch to metric, but that\'s another story... ;-)

GT has some of the best Traveller books ever (eg Far Trader) and I welcome
SJGs work.

There is a second post to David with this one - the basic thing is that
Traveller actually has this built in, but GURPS has it as a one line aside
in the Success Rolls chapter...

>Sorry to waffle on. I\'m genuinely interested in the difference, I just

In a nutshell - Traveller\'s task system has the possibility of different
difficulty levels built in and was designed with this in mind. GURPS has it
kind of bolted on to the skill roll, if you pick up on the passing
reference.

Functionally it makes bugger all difference if the GM knows about it and is
prepared. Philosophically, it\'s miles apart.

Why\'s more than a week absurd?  For a 1-G vessel, doing the accel-flip-
decel mission profile,

  d = 2 * (0.5 * a * (t/2)**2)
    = a * t**2 / 4

Which, for a = 10 m/s^2 and t = 1 week = 604800 s, results in a distance
travelled of 914457600000 m, or 914,457,600 km, or roughly 6 AU.  This is
a typical distance for e.g. trips between habitable worlds and inner gas
giants, or from one part of an asteroid belt to another -- which are
surely among the most common in-system trip types.

Even in a 2-G vessel, the trip range only increases to 12 AU, still quite
normal for inner-system-to-nearest-GG trips.  And remember that for some
such you may want or need to keep reserve fuel as well.

I love CC, though I have to pick when I play it carefully; the tension
level is insane, and I end up both exhausted and twitchy for an hour after
a game session.

The aspect you\'d get in the proposed you-are-an-admiral FFW computer game
that is *not* modeled in CC is being unsure where your own forces are.
I\'ve actually contemplated doing a space game like this for several years
now, and come up with some of the same ideas (e.g., date-stamped position
info) as were suggested here.  Maybe it\'s finally time to stop
contemplating and start coding. :)

I loved Harpoon.  But then again, I\'m a sucker for naval combat in any
form.

Not sure of overall density of interplanetary dust, but a 1 milligram dust
particle at 84 G-hours speed has an energy of 4.5 megajoules with better
focus than any laser, and should be able to punch holes in your average
unarmored craft without difficulty.

I suspect all space interceptor missiles are being (re)designed for GT:Starships
after the recent thread on Advanced Armour (i.e. to remove it). My missile
designs don\'t use exactly the same design philosophy as used in GT so are
probably unacceptable anyway. I also don\'t like the idea of losing control of my
own designs and them passing from the public to the private domain (at least not
without serious financial incentives ;-) ).

Also using Liquid Hydrogen rather than water as fuel would make a big
performance increase due to the weight saving, and could be justified as being
more Travelleresque.

The only ships I\'ve actually used HEPlaR drives in are for my (TL10)GURPS 
Space campaign. If you want Traveller-like accelerations, you really can\'t 
carry more than about 24 hours of fuel (in most cases, you can get by with 
1/2 or 1/3 of that -- enough fuel to go from surface to 100D, then from 100D 
to surface). Interplanetary ships (lighters, SDBs) will need more fuel, of 
course, but since they don\'t carry jump drives they have the space.

BTW, I think we are talking about reaction mass, not fuel (don\'t have FF&S 
handy, so I can\'t recall).

A generous and sadistic GM,

Based on performance, it appears that HEPlaR thrusters do induce fusion in
their reaction mass, so \'fuel\' is correct.

Everyone seems to agree we should look at character details initially, so
that\'s where I\'ve started. The DTD is well on the way and currently covers
basic information (name, rank, title, UPP) and I am working on adding skills
and a brief homeworld description (tech group - high / middle / low, plus a
free text section).

To meet the XML browser / programme standards I am including object
categories in as much details as I can so that a programme can work on the
DTD structure to produce or interpret the XML data. I\'d prefer to wait until
I have a full DTD for characters, but I\'m happy to post what I have so
others can work on it with me - if we use it as a standard way of passing on
details then we should all have free access to the code. If anyone wants a
copy, I\'ll send it by email or post it to the group; meantime, an example of
what the XML looks like follows.

The document is fully valid, well-formed and consistent (XML terms - sorry
for the jargon) has been built with XML Spy and can be viewed with an
XML-capable browser (such as IE5, but not Netscape or Opera as yet).
Homeworld and skills are not complete, so I\'ve not included them in the
example. Also, I\'m making a change so that the character descriptions can be
put in as text rather than comments as they are in the example. I\'ve not
included the DTD, since that\'s obviously a fair bit bigger than the XML
document example.

Actually, he did make the CUF rolls. More importantly, he had nowhere to

GURPS doesn\'t have the task system that MT/TNE/T4 players are used to.
This has been used to claim it "doesn\'t have a task system" and similar
claims that imply that GURPS is missing  fundamental.  That would be my
like saying MT "doesn\'t have a skill system" because it doesn\'t rate skills
on how hard they are and then telling anyone who objected that he was just
getting hung up on nomenclature.

I understand that it isn\'t what they are used to, but when they
insist on saying "it doesn\'t have a task system" rather than just
saying it doesn\'t work like they are used to, you have to wonder
why....

I build a 60kJ rainbow laser with ROF 20 for exactly this purpose but
found the power consumption to be too high (particularly for a battle
dress power systems). So my solution was to use a 1mm electromag gun
with heavy auto, that plus 5000 rounds of ammo, a couple of passive
sensors and a targeting computer makes a fine and dandy PD weapon. Total
of about 0.3 cf it becomes the Bowler of doom. See the rules pVE197 for
shooting down missiles.

	Thermal Superconducting armor helps against the plasma/fusion weapons,
but mostly it just turns into an arms race. My favorite weapon of choice
for over armored targets is a pion gun. All the armor in the world
doesn\'t help there.

The central point here is....

I see it as taking a flexible system of modifiers and locking it up
into a more rigid framework.  Now I\'m sure everyone has their own
preferences, but that is _all_ it is, a preference.   GURPS is in
no way inferior to MT, it is just _different_ with its own faults
and avantages....

An issue of presentation.  You could make a similar table for GURPS.

[on other specifics...]

>One of the things is that the task system is a VERY convenient shorthand...

Actually, it is not that short, MT uses more space delinating
how hard a skill is in a certain situation than GURPS books do.
The "routine, difficult, etc." is slightly easier to remember,
but also locks you into fixed increments.  This is all generally
trivial.  I, and other, have come up with descriptive labels.  They
don\'t attract much interest becuase it just isn\'t a big deal to
most.

Yes, the MT task system has some nice things about it.  But it
is hardly some advanced mechanic that GURPS is only an "evoulutionary
step toward" or some such other bunk.

>And because the basic interpersonal tasks are listed as well, including the

An GURPS gives a large number of modifiers for non-combat situations
(though in GURPS these are often dependant on another roll, or rating,
an advantage of not using fixed labels).  I haven\'t counted how many,
and the GURPS books don\'t seek to set them off in little spaces (a
debatable use of limited space), but I would be surprised if their
weren\'t _well_ over forty.  OTOH, some of those apply to situations
which won\'t come up in Traveller (like how hard it is to ride a
war horse without holding the reins) so the situations is muddy.

>Lacking appropriate tools? In GURPS, the modifier may vary from skill to
>skill; in MT, increase difficluty 1 step.

No.  The modifier doesn\'t vary.  You have the skill you are suppose
to use and the modifier.  If you can convince the GM to allow you
to substitute a new skill, the modifier won\'t change.

>seldom clearly presented modifiers presented throughout GURPS...

Yes, I will agree they are clearly presented in MT.  This is just
an issue of presentation.  (You could do something similar in
GURPS where you present the task, the skill one should use for it,
and the modifier and ofset them in spaces in the text)

>GURPS lacks a consistant effect of Skill on Time Taken. 2300 and MT had a
>consistant system. TNE dropped the time roll.

Yeah, this _can_ be of some use.  They also are a double edged sword
(they give a rigid system that doesn\'t, IMO, reflect real life well),
but there are there if they need them.  A long cry, however, from
saying that GURPS doesn\'t have task system (just as much as saying
MT doesn\'t have a skill system because there is not rating of how
hard skills are or how you progress along a learning curve).

>Yes, I remember that Katana defaults to Broadsword-2. But I can\'t remember
>the modifier for defaulting from Dex to either Broadsword or Katana, nor
>the penalty for Physics defaulting from IQ

Actually, MT is lacking consistent system of being able to use one
skill with another.  It allows you to substitute one skill for another
in specific tasks, but outside of that you are left hanging and you
have to remember how skills substitute in each individual task.  GURPS
tells you that Shortsword defaults to Broadsword at a -2 for _all_
applications.  This is actually easier to remember in GURPS, its
just that GURPS has an expanded system for this sort of thing
comared to MT.

No more so than in MT.  MT tells you how hard it is to do _one
task_, no more.

You have it wrong.  If someone is a -6 to hit because of dim
light, then it is a -6 find your vac suit.  The modifier is
based on the situation.

Just as MT gives a long list of diffculty levels for individual
situations.

The verbal lable can be handy, but really only to brand new GMs.  I made up
such a system and ended up really never using it myself becuase there
wasn\'t any need for it.  Sometimes verbal labels can be hard because they
can be vague and mean different things to different people (what does
"difficult" mean?  Is the task you are thinking about really "diffucult"?
With expereince this becomes clearer, but then with experience you don\'t
really need the label anymore).

A little table of verbal modifiers could be handy, I would have stuck one
in GT, but the ones that have been made up haven\'t attracted much attention
becuase, simply, they are no big deal...

Hogwash.

GURPS gives modifiers just as MT gives difficulties.  An advantage
of modifiers is that you can stack them (what if you are in bad
footing _and_ in poor light?).

>The end effect may be similar, but the underlying structure of the rules
>mechanism is fundamentally different.

No it isn\'t.  Change the target number or modifing the roll are
mathmatically the same thing.  The only difference it the verbal
modifier which can be bit more intuitive but is more granular and
is not additive.

Yes it does.  It does _exactly_ what MT does.  It give specific
instances and tells you how hard thing are in those situations
(it just does it with modifiers rather than changing the target
number).

Which would be fine if they said the GURPS system was different

want.

No, I get the perception because people not only describe the difference
as some lack in GURPS, but _insist_ on doing so, to the degree that
when I way it really is just a matter having a system they aren\'t used to,
I get long replies like this on how MT is superior.

But look at what IG put out.  It _was_ worse.

If it is windy could you start another fire in front of you and move

Perhaps it would be useful to have a loudspeaker playing the sound of a

Not the case at all. I don\'t think that I can agree that Chapter 12 has a
"passing reference." For people who haven\'t looked at the GURPS rules this
passing reference covers between 1/3 and 1/2 of a page of text at the
*beginning* of the chapter on success rolls. Still, if that\'s all their was,
I would agree with you that it might not be enough for people who want to
play GURPS. It\'s not. The average reader of the Basic Set will have been
introduced to the concept previously in the book.

In Chapter 7, on page 45, under the heading "Meaning of Skill Levels" not
only is there an introduction to the concept, there\'s also a table of
probabilities. In this table, there are even intuitive verbal tags for these
skill levels. For example, a character with a skill level of 6 is "Inept" at
that skill, while a character with a skill level of ten is considered
"Average" and 16 or above a character is considered to be an "Expert." There
are other tages, but I just listed a few. For every skill level up to and
including 16 a probability is included. Since 17 and 18 always fail in the
GURPS system, this makes perfect sense.

Underneath the table are the following paragraphs:

"These figures give the probability of succeeding on the first try at a task
of *average* difficulty -- whatever that is. Remember that your roll for a
difficult task will be *modified* by the GM. If you have a Lockpicking skill
of 18, you will get most ordinary locks on the first try. But a tough
lock -- -8 to open -- gives you an effective skill of only 10 and your
chance to open it drops to 50%!

"Note that once your skill reaches a level of 14 or so, your chance of
succeeding doesn\'t really go up very much with each added point of skill.
Furthermore, learning those added points of skill gets harder and harder. It
isn\'t pointless, though. For instance, suppose you have a Lockpicking skill
of 23. Ordinary locks are no easier for you -- you can\'t have better than a
98% chance, no matter what. But that hard lock, which was -8 to open,
adjusts your skill down to 15 -- which still gives you a 95% chance to open
it on the first try!"

(All emphasis is from the text, not my own.)

If you think that the average Traveller player, when confronted with GURPS,
will have any sort of difficulty understanding that skills *can* and *should
be* modified according to the difficulty of the task at hand, I simply can\'t
agree with you. If you think that the average Traveller player will have
difficulty understanding how to modify tasks appropriately according to
their difficulty in GURPS, I can\'t agree either. Come on, is it that
difficult to look at a table with probabilities and say, "Hmmm... I want a
person with average training in this skill to succeed about 25% of the time,
so I\'ll give it a -2." or "Even an inept bungler should be able to fix the
gleaning rods most of the time, so I\'ll give the task a +6"?

If you\'re saying that Traveller players can\'t do this, and that\'s why they
have a go at GURPS, then it says less about the system\'s flaws and more
about either their real motives or their intelligence.

I don\'t care to win any converts here, I don\'t really care if anyone plays
GURPS, and I will admit that GURPS does have certain flaws: Advanced Combat
can be very clunky until a group gets the hang of it, for example, and I
initially found the way armor is handled in GURPS to be more than a little
non-intuitive... there are other problems I have with the system, but I
don\'t feel like going into them right now.

However, you accused the GURPS system of not giving the GM the proper tools
to modify skill rolls based on difficulty of the task at hand, nor an
introduction to using those tools -- neither of those accusations are true.

(Douglas, please remind me to add a footnote on David Lee Roth to the
"Elvis is Yaskodray" essay.)

Yes, if you\'re in a jump-capable vessel (and have the fuel).  For many
purposes this is massive overkill.  A lot of in-system traffic is going to
use far less expensive no-jump boats even for multi-week trips, with "jump
service" as an expensive alternative, sort of like flying the Concorde
across the Atlantic.

Possibly valid reaction.  Given that from earliest canon (LBB 2) the
thruster-enabled accel-flip-decel profile has been standard, implied canon
is that Trav hulls can take a little .01c dust without doing more than
scouring the paint a bit.

> Because any reaction engine capable of a G-week has insane performance? 

This is the kicker.  Yes, of course it does.  That\'s why you don\'t get to
fly accel-flip-decel profiles in a HEPlaR vessel.  But again, a-f-d
profiles are both canonical and (IMHO) part of the trav \'feel\' -- which
thus requires recourse to magic t-plates, which violate conservation laws
and turn every lifeboat into a potential planet-cracker.  That\'s the
dilemma.

You\'d think so, wouldn\'t you?  Good thing about that ultrahard unobtainium
alloy they use for hulls...shame it\'s no good against lasers, or even
missiles...just dust. :)

Two main problems. First, you need something to *ignite* the tracer
compound. With conventional firearms, the powder does this nicely.
Second, the projectiles for man portable gauss weapons tend to be smaller in
diameter, thus making it much harder to get a decent amount of tracer
compound into them.
One possiblity (that risks ruining the weapon) would be for "rail gun" type
weapons to fire titanium projectiles and somehow ignite them (preferabbly as
they leave the barrel! :-).
That would provide a nice tracer effect, and possibly make a decent
incendiary round. Especially from larger caliber weapons. :-)

On a different tack . . . 

Given that high tech infantry probably have some sort of noise suppressor &
comms combo as part of their kit, or even civies with those ubiquitous com
dots, why not have a sensor on the weapon simply bleep to the com unit when
down to the third last round. No one hears it but the weapon\'s owner, unless
the opposition has some hefty electronics to detect it.

I know that in 1905 or there abouts, all the buildings on Galveston Island
in Texas were jacked up (some up to 13 feet) and sand was pumped under them
to raise the island.
That was pretty impressive for 1900ish.
Traveller should have some really fancy tech to handle the job.

[snip flaming tungsten suggestion :-)] 

How about something different.  Instead of an incendiary compound for the
tracer, use a light-emitting chemical like a cyalume (but faster reacting).
 Put the catalyst in a vial that breaks and mixes on the launch
acceleration but which can survive normal handling.  You get a light source
probably starting a few feet downrange, which isn\'t necessarily a bad
thing.

Alternatively, how about a very small light-emitting diode, activated by
either the acceleration or the magnetic field of the gun?  It could even be
a small low-power laser, giving the tracer some directionality.

Or have it simply display a low-rounds light in the sight picture, so you
don\'t  need even low-power transmissions.

In the official Traveller Universe, that minor legality didn\'t stop
Margaret from artificially inseminating herself to produce a "legal" heir
to the throne. Of course, Challenge magazine folded right after that so I
don\'t know what finally happened to the twins.

Nope. And the one I have is B&W on paper slightly better than
newsprint. It was in an article on weapons grade lasers in Analog,
probably about 15-20 years back. 

But I meant it when I said *cheap* special effect. The ionization blobs
weren\'t distributed *anything* like evenly. Really *odd* look.

For any given size of rock, Ke = .5 * m * v^2. So the faster it goes,
the better off you are. 

A 1 ton projectile moving at about 1.5% C isn\'t much worse than a large
nuclear bomb. 

A small asteroid, moving at a few km/sec is a planet killer.

There\'s really little point in bothering. 

Consider, you jump into the enemy system a fair ways above the
ecliptic, and start your passive sensors. Sure, they\'ll know where you
came out of jump. In 15 minutes to several hours, depending on how far
away they are. 

They *won\'t* know what vector you entered the system with (I use
"original vector preserved thru jump"). And even if they can spot you,
unless they have a truly unrealistic number of ships "lurking" all over
the system, there won\'t be anybody that can get in weapons range of you
for *days*. By which time you\'ll have jumped out again. 

Sure, this restricts you to long range recon. But given *current* tech,
you can get *damn* good images from several AU away with a decent
telescope if you are outside the atmosphere. As in "read the license
plate" type resolution on anything else outside atmosphere.

Other passive sensors will work well too. You\'ll just need to deploy
large foldable arrays. 

So systems near the "border" will just have to put up with frequent spy
ship incursions. Every once in a great while, they\'ll get lucky and one
will come out close to a picket ship (very long odds against this
happening). In which case the spy ship destroys all evidence before it
gets boarded.

Which becomes 306 degrees when you reduce it. And then, considering
that it was probably measured counter-clockwise (widdershins) it
becomes 54 degrees clockwise (deasil).

Actually, vessels are virtually *immune* to such attacks, as neither
sort of projectile has enough manueverability to be worth mentioning. 

A big problem with both is that *because* of this inability to make
anything but the most gradual course changes, by the time they are
close enough to the target for the target to be sure that they *are*
the target, it\'s virtually impossible to abort the strike. 

Thus they are of no use for threats, only for destruction.

BTW, Roger MacBride Allen had an interesting (and \'legal\') variation on
this in one of his books. The enemy assembled a mass driver in an
asteroid belt and aimed a lot of *small* (a few kg) projectiles at
where various orbital facilities would be when the projectiles arrived.

Also, by varying the velocities, they were able to make it a well
co-ordinated "time on target" strike. That is, almost all the
projectiles reached their targets at the same time. 

It severaly damaged all high orbit facilitities, and (by pure luck)
severely damaged a number of fleet units that had the misfortune to be
"in the way". 

The "steel sleet" attack was followed quickly by an attack in force by
enemy vessels.

I\'ve got it typed in, if I can just find the file. Remind me on, say,
Friday to email it to you on Saturday.

I pulled it from Uller Uprising to use as my world description for Wypoc,
which I used fo rthe Sahdows adventure. I figured flourine would make a
nice insidious atmosphere.

Unfortunately, it looks like flourine might be too reactive. There was an
article by Dr, Gillett in Analog explaining why sometime in the last couple
of years. I\'ll try to find that one for you as well. Again, remind me on
Friday.

That\'s at least three of us with similar ideas (you, me, and

Or take the smart gun approach and have a running tally of rounds left

I\'m firmly of the opinion that infantry weapons in the future are going to
as smart as the weapons on the M1A1.

At least with tracers you can get \'blindfire\' ones that don\'t ingnite 
for 5-10m, providing you with a _little_ protection from detection.

I agree with you. What I was (trying to) point out was that in a hunter-
gastherer, or (especially) a primitive agricultural society there is 
something else - a limited food supply. In your example above with 10 
adults if they were pre-industrial farmers they could really only 
support 2 or maybe 3 non-productive children, so whether 5 were women 
or 9 were women wouldn\'t really matter. Though having only 1 male would 
make the community very vulnerable to accident.

BTW a great many bird species rely quite heavily on the male\'s 
contribution to raise the young.

Other igniteable metals you could use include depleted uranium. I can 
see it now: APFSDSDU-TI (Armour Piercing Fin Stabilised Discarding

I\'d tone it down even more - to +-2 per difficulty level. When using a 
3d6 range a plus two effectively halves the chance of failure if the 
target number was 11+, or doubles the chance of success if the target 
number was 10- (roughtly speaking). As a TNE fan I quite like this 
halving/doubling effect. The only problem is that GURPS seems to 
consider anything less than a +-3 modifier as hardly woth bothering 
with.

However for this to be of much use you have to be able to do something 
about the firer before he uses his traceable rifle bullets to take out 
his target and/or the sensor\'s operator.

I can imagine this happening with a pistol, but not with most military

Ah, but the fun one could have :) There\'d be less recoil, too.

BTW the RPK-47 automatic rifle (or LMG, if you prefer) came with a 70 
round (IIRC) drum magazine for use in the ititial assault, and after 
that you switched to the standard AK-47 30 round magazines. It would 
appear that the Soviets found the bigger mag to be too heavy or clumsy 
for general use.

I\'ve encountered this, too. I think that the cardboard boxes started to

Some of the cheaper 5.56mm ammo comes in 20 round boxes and loading a 
whole lot of 30 round mags is really time consuming, boring and hard on 
the fingers.

Try rebuilding an MG link in this sort of situation because the 
resupply was of loose rifle ammo only. Fortunately it was only an 
exercise...

The AK-47 has a chromed barrel to reduce wear, so I imagine that an 
Afghani copy would suffer fairly dramatic barrel erosion quite quickly.

In the event that anyone joins a TCS campaign using either HG2 or
T4/FF&S2, let it be known that AuricTech Shipyards is willing to design
ships for any participants.  Our only real fee (in other words, my
request that you respect my intellectual property rights to a given
design) is acknowledgment (both in the game and, after the game ends, on
the TML) that any AuricTech designs used came from our design bureau (of
course, in-game one must note that standard architect\'s fees must be
paid for _any_ new design, IAW TCS rules [see pages 8 and 19 of Adv 5
(TCS) for details]).  We will strive to meet whatever design parameters
you provide, and we will supply you with the full design and
construction blueprints [OOC: the Excel 5.0 spreadsheet in .zip format],
as well as the appropriate final design parameters.  Turnaround time
averages three to five solar days from time of receipt to time of
transmission for designs (obviously, construction takes much longer).

Naturally, we will ensure that no AuricTech custom designs will leak to
any other parties, prior to the final end of hostilities (the end of the
TCS game).

No problems there. I love the Narn bombing scene from Babylon 5 (althought the

If the first shot had not punctured the hanger where the *whole* Britanic high
command, a large percentage of the senior officers and senior political figures
where having dinner, the effect would not have been so savige. It was pure dumb
luck that Guardians blindsided the fleet when they did. A fleet in a typical
High Guard position would have easily avoided the most damage by the simple
method of moving.

BTW the book i refer to can be ound in RMA "Aliens and Allies" anthology
(origionally published as a novel Rouge Powers. Buy it, it is the bets 2300AD
book I ever read :-)

In the Near C Accords, This would be an allowed weapon, as it is a low impact
weapon, at most it has the same effects as the bombing of Drezden or Tokyo, not
the distruction of whole land masses.

>The "steel sleet" attack was followed quickly by an attack in force by

The most damage was done by bio-engineered metal eating bugs that ate the
Britanin fleet, with massive loss of life. The Guardian fleet was wiped out with
little effort.

OBTrav. Maybe a better virus would be a organism capable of eating superdense
metals?

I wold imagine that your thoughts were along the lines of "Fun, Travel,
Adventure" ["FTA"], especially since I would expect that your machine
guns, like most (if not all) modern machine guns use disintegrating-link
belts (for the uninitiated, that means belts held together by many small
bits of metal, connected only by the brass of the machine gun ammo, as
opposed to one long piece of metal or cloth).

(For the _truly_ uninitiated, "FTA" is short for "F**k The Army".  One
may note that, in my Basic Training "SMART" book [I forget what the
acronym means, but it\'s a book of common soldier information], one could
have found "FTA", neatly inscribed in pencil, in such diverse places as
the bore evacuators of drawings of Soviet tanks and the front of
drawings of Claymore mines.)

ObTrav:  If any slang acronyms from the modern US Army survive in the
3I, I would expect "FTA" and "FIGMO" ["F**k It, Got My Orders" (either
to change stations or to leave the service)] to be among them.  Other
possible surviving acronyms would be "FIDO" [F**k It, Drive On] and
BOHICA ["Bend Over, Here It Comes Again"].

If you want to see my design philosophy in action (using FF&S2), go to:

http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Shadowlands/9776/travler.html

Two other points:

1.  If you haven\'t guessed by the name I\'ve given to my design bureau, I
tend to build Gold-Plated [tm] ships.  I figure that the increased
sensor capability (a common factor in high ship costs) of my designs
often justifies the increased cost.  After all, a defending ship that
can detect attackers early often can avoid attack altogether. 
Similarly, an attacking ship that can detect its targets early can
maneuver to ensure a successful attack, often from surprise.

2.  Increased cost _does_ allow increased capability.  Obviously, ships
that expect to see combat need better sensors, armor, and firepower than
ships that are not expected to see combat.  Ships that are high-value
targets (such as yachts, VIP transports, and other ships carrying
high-value passengers or cargo) are natural targets for pirates or enemy
commerce raiders, and thus need better defenses.

Besides, you\'ll notice that THUDDD voting has several different
categories.  Often the "best overall" design is _not_ voted as "most
likely to use in a campaign."  Thus, THUDDD participants can vote both
for the best design (probably expensive) and for the most likely used
design (probably less expensive).
> 
> (They want 800 ZCr (zillions) for that ship!! You can get almost the same
> functionality using SSDS and at a fraction of the cost!!)

This is often the case.  One must then perform a cost/benefit analysis. 
If the higher cost of a civilian ship ensures a higher delivery rate of
cargo and passengers, the increase in cost may be worthwhile.  If the
increase in cost does not translate to a sufficient increase in delivery
of cargo and passengers, then the increase in cost is counterproductive
in a merchant vessel.  For warships, the question becomes: will a large
number of relatively cheap starships provide more combat power per
credit spent than a smaller number of realtiveively expensive,
more-capable starships?  Factors here include firepower, defenses
(active [sandcasters, PD weapons, and screens] and passive [armor]),
acceleration, jump distance, and endurance.  Juggling these factors
leads to differences in ship design.  Manwhile, yachts must perform at
whatever parameters the prospective owner desires (cost of operation
often being nearly immaterial), or nobody will buy them.

Note also that SSDS ships are based on a Standard life support system (2
weeks duration).  Ships that require longer cruise durations (such as
most warships) will cost more, since they need to allocate tonnage both
to Extended life support systems and to increased ration supplies.

> But then again, this (the budgetary constraint) is why TCS is such an
> interesting testing ground.

True enough.  Probably, a fleet that has some AuricTech ships (which
tend to have superior sensors for their class) and some non-AuricTech
ships (which, since they only need adequate sensors [since the AuricTech
ships can perform early-detection functions] can mount greater
firepower, protection, and/or maneuverability) will do best in T4/FF&S2
TCS games.

OK, I got a bit of scepticism about whether or not the "Norris solution"
could work.  Here is a longer version, based on earlier thoughts of mine
about how to prolong the Hard Times.  

1.  Dulinor\'s flagship misjumps under mysterious circumstances.  Dulinor is
assassinated.

2.  Hutara captures Capital with the Coronation Fleet.  Lucan flees.

3.  Given the mysterious circumstances of Dulinor\'s death, Isis stays on
Dlan.  Hutara declares himself Regent.

4.  Lucan is declared insane, and deposed.  Tranian declares for Margaret.

5.  Norris feels obliged to send a (fairly small) fleet to support
Strephon.  It crosses the Great Rift by use of calibration points (fuel
caches) and tanker squadrons.  This revives Strephon\'s previously moribund
faction.

6.  Unsupported by Isis, hated by Lucan\'s former worlds, attacked by
Strephon/Norris and Margaret/Tranian, Hutara is defeated.

7.  Strephon and Margaret cut a deal.  Isis sues for peace.  The Moot is
recalled.

8.  The Imperium is restored.  The Imperium is a smoking ruin.

9.  Up to you.

Notes:  The "solution" above is, of course, partial and unstable.  It only
includes some of the factions, and some areas of the former Imperium.  It\'s
quite possible that a partition of the Imperium could result.  This gives
scope for the emergence of other states in what was Imperial territory,
which the "restored" Imperium can\'t, and possibly doesn\'t want to attempt
to, recover in the near future.  This is particularly likely to apply in
the rimward areas.  That\'s where a republican confederation is likely to
emerge - between the "restored" Imperium and the Solomani Confederation. 
(Diaspora?  Daibei?  Parts of the Solomani Rim?)

Another option is Antares, in the aftermath of Brzk\'s assassination.  There
is likely to be a bunch of successor states here, who might well adopt a
model influenced by the Julian Protectorate in the absence of an effective
central government.

Obviously, we can\'t get a consensus as to the desirability of any
"solution" to the "Rebellion question".  Still, this solution can at least
accomodate some of the expressed preferences, to a certain amount.  There\'s
an Imperium, a Republic, lots of microstates, and a bucketload of anarchy. 
It\'s also fairly CT/MT/HT compliant.

*I* like it.  Critiques are welcome.  I\'m quite happy to modify the model
to accomodate them, if its possible.

Not a military expression but one used by the British  police  in
high speed pursuits (etc) is "Golf Lima Foxtrot". This translates
as "go like f***!", and means to drive very fast.

It\'s absurd, because in most cases you can do an in-system "microjump"
to cover the same distance in only a week. If you can\'t do a jump due
to lack of fuel, spending a week using what\'s left at a high rate isn\'t
the brightest thing in the world. 

And check out the velocity at turnover for a constant boost trip of
"only" a week:

g	V (km/s)	V (%c)
- --	----	----
1	 3,024		1.008
2	 6,048		2.016
3	 9,072		3.024
4	12,096		4.032
5	15,120		5.040
6	18,144		6.048

At these speeds *dust* is a deadly hazard. And stray hydrogen atoms
hitting the hull may be a significant radiation hazard.

At 9e9 J for a 1 mg dust grain (assuming .1 c), that\'s a *lot* of
"scouring". About 2 *tons* of TNT equivalent. So unless you want to
revise weapons power upwards by a *lot*, this will be a problem.

At least back in the LBB days, I always just assumed that there was an

Alas, it *can\'t be good against "dust" and not good against other

Remember that the weapon was likely designed for the 30 round magazine,
not that monster "drum". Then consider that regardless of the actual

Ouch! I never thought of *that* possibility. Just trying to find links
that handn\'t been stepped on would be a chore. I bet you longed for the
old days when the "beltes" were actual *cloth*. :-)

I do hope that the after action analysis had appropriately nasty things
to say to supply?

Not anyplace yyou want the troopies breathing the air. Uranium, being a
heavy metal makes Uranium Oxide dust something you\'d really rather not
inhale. 

Titanium isn\'t that dense (about half as dense as plain steel), but
TiO2 is *very* inert. The worst you\'d get from inhaling it is
silicosis, if the particles were big enough. The naval smoke screens
use TiCl4, which reacts with the water in the air to form indiviual
molecules of TiO2 "dust" in the air. It takes *very* little to produce
insane amounts of "smoke".

But Ti is the original "hard to put out" fire. Once started, it\'ll not
only burn in oxygen, it\'ll burn in *nitrogen*. In air you get 20% TiO2,
and 80% Ti3N4(?). It\'ll pull the oxygen out of water or CO2. If try to
smother it, it\'ll pull the oxygen out of concrete and sand! That is,
it\'ll try to burn the floor/ground if it can\'t get any air. 

There are two ways to deal with burning titanium.

1. move other materials away from it (or vice versa) and let it burn out.
2. bury it in "sand" composed of stuff like TiO2 that it *can\'t* burn.

Oh yeah, just for kicks, here\'s my "Saboteur\'s Friend"TM incendiary device.

Take a bar of titanium. Plate it (or dip coat it) with a layer of
magnesium, to make it easier to light. Plate *that* with sodium or
other easy to ignite material that will react with water to start the
reaction (ie water ignites sodium, which ignites magnesium, which
ignites titanium). Coat this with something water soluble that doesn\'t
react with sodium.

Form to look like metal scraps, rocks, etc. Any sort of junk that you\'d
expect to see accumulated in odd corners outdoors. 

Casually stroll thru warehouse district or supply depot, and toss into
dark corners, were water will accumulate next time it rains. Roof topos
are good. 

Be long gone when the rainstorm arrives a day or too later, and all the
"mysterious fires" take out the critical supplies. :-)

	Your point is well made.  The original poster had presented
	a scenario in which (if I understood it correctly) the
	population might have grown from an initial group of about
	20 teenagers.  How realistic this would be should depend on
	the background of the youngsters, the resources available
	in their downed vessel, and the environment that they find
	themselves in.  Thus, the rate of increase may be 0 or even
	negative, but the general formula could still apply (except

I\'m presuming the world they\'re on (or bit of it that they\'re inhabiting at
any rate) is so Edenic that the \'survivor kids\' as someone dubbed them
would have no problem eating.  The idea was to have the population increase
as rapidly as their limited numbers (and high infant mortality rate) would
allow.  I\'m presuming that food can be abundant in a completely
untouched-by-humans landscape and that the little nutritional knowledge
they have would ensure something of a balanced diet.

Assuming that they have next to no ability to hunt for meat (at least at
first - I reckon they\'d learn swiftly), that would leave fruit, nuts,
vegetables, berries, fungi...

Anything obvious I\'ve missed?

Anything exotic/SFish anyone\'s used in Traveller situations like this?

(Let\'s grant for the moment there\'s nothing toxic in the vicinity or they
can identify it if so.)

I am a woman.  If someone told me that I had to share Hiroshi with one or
two other women, I could maybe deal with it.  I wouldn\'t like it, but
socialization in such a culture could overcome that.  But there is a
reason why even Islam limits a man to four WIVES.

If I had to share him with nine other women, someone\'s head would roll
eventually.  It might be mine or it might not.  There is a limit to a
man\'s attention and time; that\'s why wealthy men with harems had to guard
them so carefully and encourage lesbian behavior among the incarcerated.  
In other words, there are more factors here than just how many men are
needed to protect how many women and how much a male\'s contribution to
childrearing is needed.

I know quite a few women who could handle being wife #2 or #3 in a society
where women shared labor; it would mean they\'d have some time to do things
for themselves.  I know of no one who would want to be wife #9.

Perhaps if he was able to negotiate some sort of agreement with the Zho, 
that would allow him to free most of the resources he needs.  Plus, he does 
have the mothball fleets and considering what the opposition would be able

A super-fast molecular computer driven by

posed by the physical limitations of silicon.
Berlin-based chemist James La Clair has
developed molecules that can be switched

Thursday.

I don\'t think the situation would be as much "multiple wives" as "single
sperm donor". The lucky(?) man probably won\'t form close relationships
with all the women, perhaps not even more than one or two of them.
A close relationship has never been a requirement for starting a baby.
(That\'s not to say jealousies can\'t tear the colony apart.)

That\'s assuming the people involved see an overriding need to make
enough kids to try and keep the colony going. If all we have are some
young adults hoping for rescue, they may not "get practical" before their 
breeding time runs out. As a result, the first generation births would be
limited by whatever social mores the survivors came from - if monogamy
was a strict virtue, you might only see one woman having babies per
man in the colony, if that.

Two examples of \'single sperm donor\' are:

- - The Postman by David Brin ... its been so long since I read the
  book I can\'t remember if its in  the  book  itself  but  it  is
  definately in the film version with  Kevin  Costner.  Including
  covering the jealousy angle.

- - A Boy And His Dog (film) ... an extreme example where the  less
  than willing donor is strapped to a  table  and  apparatus  not
  unlike a cow milking machine drains him dry!

In both cases there was a society with a lack of healthy  fertile
males for breeding.

Another example is Edward P. Hughes\' "Barley Cross" series of stories,
included in several volumes of Pournelle\'s "There Will Be War" anthology
series.  The workaround instituted by the town involved making the one
fertile male (and later, his fertile son) Lord of the village, and
granting him _droit du seigneur_.  Although the stories don\'t mention
it, I would assume that weddings were timed to ensure maximum fertility
of the brides in question, since this is a one-shot-only method.

Yes, but in LBB days, maneuvering didn\'t use fuel per se.  You fueled your
power plant (and with a smallish amount of fuel, too) on a monthly basis,
and it in turn powered any amount of thruster use during that month. 
Hence my term \'magic carpet drive\'.

I know that.  Hence the smiley. :)  But one handwave is as good as
another, once you get into the violating-physical-laws game...

Note that another advantage of HEPlaR in this regard is that with a
typical ship having only 40 G-hrs of thrust available, you can\'t get up
into deadly-dust-grain velocity regimes.  But, as I mentioned, this also
means that planning in-system trips gets much harder, and executing them
usually takes much longer.

And again, in-system jumps make sense if you have a jump drive, but
j-drives and their associated fuel tankage make transporting a given
payload in-system much more expensive per ton.  Most low-priority cargo
and passengers will travel through normal space for anything under a

Perhaps you and Jesse could engage in some feedback so he could render the

The Zhos weren\'t his biggest problem.  The Vargr to coreward and the Aslan to rimward were.  Now, if he were to cut a deal with the Aslans pouring into his rimward border, he *might* have picked up enough throwweight to start pressing through Corridor, especially if he could get a couple good sized bands of Vargr to sign on with him.  But he\'d still be leaving Deneb wide open for any \'unassured\' Vargr incursions.

He had the Imperial Warrant in his hand when he signed the documents 
elevating himself to Archduke.  With things getting stupid around him, it was 
the only way he could have a chance at guaranteeing the continued safety of 
the Marches and the Domain.  And yeah, in my take, that Warrant made it 100% 
legal.  Remember the legalese on it?  <grin>

He used that warrant *sparingly*.  Santanocheev was screwing the pooch 
bigtime when Norris relieved him of command.  It was obvious to *anybody* he 
had to be replaced.  The Warrant went into his safe after he replaced him, to 
be held for later useage.  And remember, Strephon later told him by mail that 
he did the right thing.  Thing is, if he *didn\'t* have that Warrant in his 
hand when he kicked Santanocheev out of the Big Chair, he wouldn\'t have had 
the authority to do it.

Writing from work can sometimes cause thought processes to not be stated 
clearly!  ;-)

I guess what I had intended to say, was that the deal would have the Zho 
apply pressure on their doggie allies as well as beef up the presence in 
the Vanguard Reaches sector to offset the Aslan.  This would still leave a 
weak point along the coreward border of Deneb and Corridor.

Norris used the weight of that Warrant *twice*.  Once to relieve Santanocheev and once to elevate himself to Archduke.  It wasn\'t like he waved it around to get free lunches whereever he ate.

In the OTU, it was almost like they were setting up a \'Norris vs Margaret\' 
battle after Dulinor and Lucan whacked each other out.

	Bugs.  Not very appitizing, but common, nutricious, and
	generally easy to catch.  If there are no large carnivores,
	large animals may also be easy to catch, as they may not
	have evolved any strategy to avoid being eaten.  Even with
	predators, some animals might rely on such things as spines
	to protect themselves, and may be easy to kill (e.g.
	porcupines).  Eggs, if you can find them.  Fish, clams, and
	other aquatic organisms might be relatively easy to catch,
	depending on the size of the water habitat.  Hopefully,
	rations and vitamines from the ship will keep them going
	while they learn how to forage.

	If there were relatively large Trapper-type plants, freshly-
	killed animals might be carefully stolen by the survivors.
	Likewise, some local hazard (tar pit?) might trap animals
	that the kids could not otherwise catch.  Semi-intelligent
	locals might be capable of trade, but that would change the
	scenario substantially.

a _total_ lack would be of course...).  It\'s a lack of fertile females
that really slows you down, which is why population biologists concentrate
on them as the limiting factor.  

I remember one of my teachers telling me "Men are expendable.  We could
easily eliminate 90% of the males on the planet and survive quite well. 
How does that make you feel?" My response was "A 10:1 female to male
ratio? Let\'s do it!" :-)  Of course it only occurred to me later that
unless they were selecting for good gaming genes I would probably be one
of the first eliminated... :-) 

This of course reminds me of the scene at the end of Dr. Strangelove
(spoiler coming, if somehow you haven\'t seen it) where he tells the
assembled generals that to survive in the salt mines they\'re going to need
a 10 to 1 ratio of women to men and that because the men would be expected
to do a "prodigious amount of copulation" that the women would have to be
selected for their "arousing sexual characteristics".  I love Kubrick! :-)

I had a point here somewhere, now where was it?  Oh yes, the stranded kids
would probably be able to create a surviving colony for a few generations
assuming they weren\'t all brothers and sister and that they were willing
to use some alternative social forms.  In this sense their youth might
give them much-needed flexibility, allowing them to adopt a kind of
communal system where paternity would not be such an issue.  

Even with just 5 males and 5 females, you can create a second generation
of 25 kids, none of whom share both parents.  This is a regimen of 5 kids
per female, with each coming from a different father.  This is an
idealized situation of course, assuming no deaths in labor, perfect
fertility and (most of all) willingness to follow such a system.  But this
does give an upper boundary to work with.  If they do the same thing for
the third generation (assuming 12 females in the second generation), you
get 60 kids who don\'t share both parents nor (I think...) any
grandparents. 

The short version is that after a few generations there would be some
inbreeding problems, but with careful record-keeping and match-making you
could keep going for a while.

While I much prefer t-plates for Traveller, reducing the fuel consumption
for heplar by a factor of 100 is unnecessary. Heplar currently has an ISP
of 4 million.  For anything not involving anti-matter or similar exotic
stuff this is too high. However the 400,000 to 1 million range is
perfectly reasonable for a fusion rocket.  I\'m assuming that heplar
involves actual fusion of the hydrogen, since otherwise it would be
pathetically efficient.  So, multiply the fuel consumption by 5 and you\'re
in the ballpark of reasonable fusion.  Also, 8 G-Hours is enough to do
pretty well in the inner solar system (total Delta-V of around 280 kps). 

My personal preference for Traveller drives is a modified t-plate which
totally converts hydrogen to light-speed neutrinos.  No exhaust problems,
and the fuel consumption is 2/15s that of heplar (since the exhaust
velocity is C). 

Such a system would act like t-plates, a typical ship would have 150-300
G-hours, but unlike conventional t-plates momentum and energy are
conserved.  It looks like a reactionless drive, but behaves
conventionally.

Assuming your fusion rocket produces 10^-4 Gs or less, sure.

I\'m fond of that too, because it comes fairly close to CT fuel consumption; I
tried to convince people to use it for GT (with no luck), though conversion
thrusters made it into GURPS Space 3/e.  It doesn\'t really fix problems with
near-c rocks, however.

This is based on the suggestion that most of the hydrogen used for a jump
is used to form a normal-space "jump bubble" in jump space. If this is the
case, the proposed stable jump bubble would be in jump space, the same
place any ship\'s jump bubble is. Except a stable jump bubble doesn\'t
disappear after a week and can be used again and again.

Thanks for that; I see what you\'re saying now. I disagree with some of
your points - the use of modifiers is right at the heart of the GURPS
system, allotted two paragraphs in the one-page Quick Start summary on
page 9 (which begins with the words "Read this first!"), as well as the
places Chris Seamans mentioned - but I *do* see the difference.

I think GURPS aims more for flexibility, MT for simplicity - both have
good and bad points. I am comfortable with GURPS, but would hate it if
all other systems disappeared.

Selected words of wisdom:
"I\'m sure everyone has their own preferences, but that is _all_ it is, a
preference.   GURPS is in no way inferior to MT, it is just _different_
with its own faults and avantages...." (David Summers)

"Personally, I feel the rules are a non-issue." (Dom Mooney)

Right, now we can get on with our near-C rock throwing...

One trick is to use a timeline in a wp with a sort function.... as things
are determined, figure out when the info will arrive back, then enter that
in your sort key position. as the turn rolls around, look up all the
"Return Despatches" for the current turn, and then return those bits to the

Depends on how efficient you want it.  3.5 G-days (1% of c) is about a kiloton per kilogram, which means a couple tons of rock will do for most cities.  On the other hand, a conventional nuclear weapon by TL 12 is probably at least 10 kT/kg and much easier to deliver.  Where relativistic rocks really come into their own is for long-haul terrorist attacks.  Take a Rampart, put it on autopilot for a planet from 600 AU out; tell the autopilot to cut thrust a day before arrival (so it will be running quiet for the last 20 AU).  A month later it hits at half the speed of light with a force of 200,000 megatons

Like we haven\'t been through this before? :->  

I\'ll sally forth with MTU "solution" to in-system travel and the
near-c rock...

A dual drive maneuver drive system with Stutterwarp drives, limited to
pseudovelocities of about 1% of c, for normal insystem position
change, and Reaction drives (HEPlaR, plasma focus, fusion, whatever)
for actual dV change.  A ship would mount a Stutter rated at something
like 2,000 km/s, and a reaction drive fueled to be capable of
something like a 40 km/s change of velocity. This ship could change
position at about 1 AU per 21 hours and with its reaction drive,
and/or gravity assist on both ends, match orbits with most anything in
a system, but it couldn\'t truly accelerate anything, not even itself,
beyond that 40 km/s. 

To tie everything together, Stutterwarp and Jump are branches of the
same science, and technically very similar. For example, all jumps, be
they the tiny stutter or the parsecs long jumps are instantaneous.  

The ultra short jumps of a stutter drive don\'t need the "jump fuel"
reaction mass or jump grid (as explained below), thus the stutter can
cycle very rapidly translating the ship rapidly across space. The
practical limit of how fast you can cycle the stutter drives is what
limits your pseudovelocity to a small faction of c. 

When you add the jump fuel to the stutter you create an artificial
wormhole though which the ship falls, instantly translocating the ship
some lightyears away. The ship is protected from the wormhole by the
"jump bubble", a pocket universe created by the jump grid. It takes
roughly a week for the "jump fuel" to dissipate across the bubble, for
the bubble to collapse and the ship to translate back into normal
space at its new location.

Learning to control, expand, and stabilize "pocket universes" is
beyond the "current level" of technology, but might be something the
"Ancients" could accomplish. Likewise, increasing the pseudovelocities
of the Stutter drive to trans-c by increasing the the cycle rate for
the short Stuttering jumps may be possible...someday, but certainly
not with current levels of technology.

There\'s more, but that\'s enough. <g>

So, now, having said my say, I\'ll withdraw from the field...

	Believe it or not, the USAF actually tested launching an ICBM from a

ignite the first stage.

	This is a good place to start, but how did you handle 
	cases in which the courier carrying the info is
	intercepted?  Of course, one could argue that a small
	vessel doing its best to avoid contact is unlikely to
	be intercepted, but sometimes a squadron will be 
	carrying such info.  I was working on a system in which
	dispatches are associated with specific vessels, and 
	may either be spread to other friendly vessels in the
	same system.  Of course, particularly sensitive orders
	might not be spread around (to lower the odds of them
	being captured), but this may increase the likelihood 
	that the intended recipient will miss the message.

References???  

Everything I\'ve read indicates that fusion rockets are great for 1 G
boosts.  Ion drives, magnetoplasmadynamic rockets and similar present
day/near future tech are all high ISP/low thrust models, but actual fusion
produces high temperatures on a much larger scale than of these options. 
Fusion drives have the capability to produce significant plumes of plasma,
not whisps of near vacuum like MPD and ion drives.

Simple thermodynamics.  A fusion torch drive isn\'t going to produce all that
much more power than a fusion reactor of similar size (not more than 1, maybe
2 orders of magnitude better).  Nothing I\'ve seen about high-efficiency fusion
drives has suggested that they would get more than .001 Gs.

An ISP 400,000 fusion torch driver, with 100x the power output of a TL 15
fusion reactor, does about .025 Gs, if your vehicle is solid engine....

The Personal Orbital Delivery System is for you.

Basically a flying airlock, this system will put a person into orbit, and back,
every hour, for the price of 2.4 megawatts of electricity (about $100 at current
wholesale prices).

Designed for efficiency, not comfort, this is basically an atmosphere missile
where the payload is an airlock containing the passenger. A limited life system
and backup radio is provided for safety.

The passenger enters the airlock and straps himself in. The PODS flies into
orbit on a pre-programmed trajectory. The orbital facility/vessel then guides
the PODS into its docking bay using laser guidance. The passenger disembarks on
the orbital facility/vessel. The PODS then returns to the ground station
optionally carrying a return passenger.

The base station just needs a laser and radio communicator and access to mains
power to recharge the batteries quickly. No need to employ an expensive pilot
and crew or to use a star port. Just employ a part time mechanic and make it all
as automated as possible. Overall a very cheap set-up with a rapid pay back on
the 300 KCr investment. The PODS can operate 21 hours a day 350 days a year.

Some minor comments:

I assume the choice of standard materials rather than expensive was deliberate
for YTU reasons. This would have saved a few tons though pushed the price up
considerably.

I got Radscanner 500 lbs, 10cf, $200,000.

IR/Thermograph/Passive Radar are already included in PESA.

The PESA and radscanner are a significant portion of the price tag. I would be
tempted to cut corners to bring the price down and reduce these a couple of scan
ratings.

This is an interface shuttle right? Have you considered making it battery
operated? A couple of hours stored power would weigh half as much, 
and only occupy 1/8 the space. Enough to get into orbit and CG/fly
back for a recharge!

>Space Performance : sAcc 0.656 g, sDec 0.656 g, sMR 0.656

This is quite ambitious for this TL! I think a little less performance
would save a great deal of price.

Keep up the good work.

>Have you considered making it battery operated? 

Having now played with the figures I am amazed at the sort of TL9 craft you can
build with them.

It would make the same performance shuttle less than 1DT, and significantly
lighter and cheaper, or allow for more cargo and thrust to be added. It would
also reduce the maintenance requirements, avoid messing with radioactives, and
eliminate the cost of replacing that costly core every 2 years.

You could add a retractable solar panel of 100 kW or more for recharging and
manoeuvring in orbit, and still come out way ahead.

I hadn\'t realized this was practical for spaceships before. I am going to have
to build one now :-)

Are there any examples of battery operated spacecraft anywhere in Traveller
canon?

Well, actually, MT would tell you how to shift the task difficult up and
down in a consistant manner. GURPS is somewhat more organic and lacks an
underlying structure in the same way. That isn\'t to say you can\'t do it. As
Chris Seamans rightly points out, with a little intuition the table on p45
of GURPS Basic can be used to develop a standardised set of modifiers.

It would be nice if this was tabulated in some way to give some standard
modifiers (maybe in a fourth ed of basic)?

In MT this is arguably the case with combat, but not with skill rolls in
general. In GURPS it is the case for both combat and skill rolls.

It gets really interesting when a player asks you \'how hard does it look?\',
and you say \' well, it looks pretty difficult\' and before you\'ve finished
they\'ve already picked up 2.5D read to make the roll. It\'s a lot less
intrusive. YMMV.

Then you can shift the task two levels.... ;-)

Alternatively, I would argue that GURPS presents the referee with an obtuse
way of looking at different task difficulties and the presentation could be
improved. But I can see your point.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*I* did not at any point go one about MT being superior, rather *I* argued
why I thought most TNE/MT/T4\'rs with problems with the GURPS system had
those feelings. *You* decided to refer everything back to MT.

William Hostman argued why he personally prefered MT, a post which was well
reasoned and polite in tone. If you pushed me to make a decision between
the two I would argue that, even errata laden, MT is a far more elegant
system than GURPS, a system that shows being a later development in RPG
terms. It\'s also better presented but GURPS does have a damn good index and
a hardcover. And GURPS combat system is a lot better than MT\'s.

And these discussions are mild - remember the Great Task System Wars? The
splits between MT/TNE etc? GURPS is getting a positively mild ride because
it is a coherent, developed system. GURPS would get an even milder ride if
the very thought of mentioning a word of critiscm - or trying to explain
where that criticsm came from - wasn\'t jumped up and down on by the longer
term GURPS advocates. If there is a \'perceived\' issue with the game, there
is something causing that perception. It may only be poor presentation in
the rules but it\'s something which would be better addressed by
constructive discussion rather than scorn and point blank refusal to accept
that others have any validity in their points.

plus ca change....

Accepted, and I had missed this point. I\'d really focussed on re-reading
the success rolls section.

Well, having the table in an obvious place would make it easier to use (I
suppose that makes me a below average Traveller player :-/ ) but having
looked at it I appreciate that all the tools are there to make the
equivalent of Traveller\'s task systems.

>However, you accused the GURPS system of not giving the GM the proper tools

I think that the tools would be better served by (1) having a short
paragraph as a guide to referees on how to set difficulty modifiers and (2)
a table linking these back to p45, maybe even integrated with P45? (3) And
a reference in the index would be just lovely. :-)

But I accept the tools are there. And thank you for bothering to find the
references - it made this a lot easy to discuss.

I have found that the modifiers that are presented are scattered through
too many books and are not highlighted/emphisized.  This makes the
system perfect for the rules-rapists of my last group to "rake me over
the coals" about GM rulings.

Thing about it is, picking a winner would be a real bitch.  Norris would have
the better overall field position *plus* a patina of legitimacy.  His downside
would be his overly long supply lines.  Margaret has the advantage of ready
resupply, but would be unpopular outside of her Safe, not to mention that her
claim is iffy at best.  She\'d be constantly trying to suppress dissention in
her backfield.

I have an odd social science textbook I picked up at a second hand thrift
shop. It had some /very/ liberal ideas in it and some diagrams of
polyamorous family structures classified as "probably unstable" and
"probably stable". I\'ll put that on my website to-do list, and put them up
in GIF form somewhere. Maybe quote some relavent text from that chapter.

Willingness may be greatly affected by libido, chance, and countless other
factors. Sounds like a lot of ifs, but initial health and origional TL and
social status is a big factor IMHO. What kind of health care had they
/before/ they crashed? High TL societies have likely erradicated many
initial problems, CT TL 13-15 can do all kinds of nice things, depending on
YTU. ;)

This sounds low in initial pop to me, and records make me cringe, but then
again we are talking high TL, right? That would seem to me to include
education (despite today\'s seeming trend ;) ) and social engineering, etc.
Hopefully the kids may be betterat co-operation, etc?

OK, I got most of that, but are you saying this natural bubble would be

_Everyone_ knows that a parsec is based on one hex.  ;-)

Actually human fertility working the way it does I suspect that the 
conception rate would start to drop off if the male:female ration 
dropped below Islam\'s 1:4 legal ratio.

The LBB\'s (1-3 anyway) explicitly say that the fuel is for the 
powerplant and _reaction mass_. To me this says that the original 
Traveller ships didn\'t use thruster plates, etc. Of course then HG came 
along and said that they do.

Unless you had a system of artifical insemination I suspect that the 
conception rate would probably be quite low with a Male:female ratio as 
low as 1:10. 1:4 would probably work OK, though.

Inbreeding is probably not going to have that bad an effect as the 
really bad specimens are going to be killed out pretty quickly. Bear in 
mind that when breeding particular characteristics in or out of 
domestic animals inbreeding is heavily used.

If what I\'ve been reading is correct the mother and child mortality 
rate, while high, probably wouldn\'t cause a drop in population under 
such conditions as malnutrition and starvation seem to be by far the 
biggest causes of miscarriage, death in labour and child death.

Once there are children around hunting would become very important. 
Unless there\'s a good plant source of protein and fat without animals 
to eat the children will tend to grow up small and the rate of brain 
developmental problems would be high. A child needs substanial amounts 
of fat in its diet until the brain stops growing at about five.

> Anything obvious I\'ve missed?

If current obstetric fashions continue, along with the recent trends in 
western standards of beauty the mortality rate in labour is going to 
push 100% for mother and child unless someone learns to perfrom 
ceaseran sections very quickly. The C-section rate is rediculous these 
days, and the current fashion is for slim hips.

Yep. WE used FM-MAGs and C9s. Both of these use metallic disintegrating 
link belts which are not intended to be reused. It\'s such great fun 
scraping them up out of the sand or mud and reusing them - not.

Sounds like the film was a bit different to Harlan Ellison\'s original short
story...

BTW, thank you Kiri for pointing out that population growth, for humans at
least, is not just a mathematical calculation (something that I thought was
obvious, but did seem to be missing in the thread).

>Another example is Edward P. Hughes\' "Barley Cross" series of stories,

Another is a short story from (I think) Robert Sheckley, where the Devil
gives the main protagonist wishes in return for his soul. The one where he
is the only fertile man on Earth turns out to be much less attractive that
it first appears. He is (not unreasonably) hated by the women he has to
"service". Obviously not an old AD&D player, who should all know by now to
be careful for what you wish for - and how you word it...

Of course, the Tukera economic influence in the Marches may help steer
an interventionist Norris into supporting Margaret (at least until
Norris learns that Strephon has, in fact, survived being assassinated). 
Thus, if Norris intervenes relatively early, Margaret may end up on the
Iridium Throne, as the least repugnant candidate.  Obviously, if Norris
waits to intervene long enough that he learns that Strephon lives, all
bets are off.

I just can\'t see Norris aiming for the purple himself.  His claim would
be even more shaky (unless his fleet was overwhelming enough to pull an
Arbellatra).  More importantly, I can\'t see Norris getting sucked into
the Brawl For The Throne, since, according to _Survival Margin_ (unless
I misunderstood), his allegiance was to the ideals of the Imperium, and
to its peoples.  Waging war against some of those peoples, for the sake
of the throne, would have been repugnant to Norris.

YMDEMV (your maneuver drive efficiency may vary).

One of my favourites (as a Royal Signals Comms Technician, generally
used to do \'customer\' support for Div Staff Officers was \'RTFM\', which
as everyone knows is \'Read the F***ing Manual !", normally followed by
\'Tango Sierra, Bravo\'   -\'Tough Sh**, B****rd\' and of course \'Foxtrot Oscar,
Bravo\'.....(I don\'t need to elaborate do I?)

Actually this sort of parlance has got me out of tricky situations...

Lt Crusher Watts, 3 (UK) Div HQ & Sig Regt could testify to this, (if he knew
what I was talking about) at 4am <some day in 1995>, when he crushed my 
perfectly made <operational length deleted for security reasons> multi channel 
core VHF cable (made with <very small number> percent tolerance) in the 
door of the secure hangar for the SECOND time on a \'rather important\' exercise 
linking up with the US Army via SatNet. I\'d just used the last of the Regimental
stock of the required parts, and I had to get replacements on a Priority 1 order
(Best fun I\'ve ever had! A Signalman \'requesting\' the CO\'s urgent signature on
the request at 4:05am, not carrying tea!) Good old LtCol Foxley! He sussed out 
exactly what I was talking about, and didn\'t get me done for insubordination, just
made Lt Watts get lots of beers in for me & my troop (and present it infront of the
\'entire\' regiment at Endex debrief -What a day!)

Anyhow, better stop my rambling... You guys will be falling asleep!

Sounds good so far.

Something like the Russia of the pre WWI scene, large and seen as
potentially dangerous, but can never seem to "pull it together."
Give me a frontier to explore along some edge of these petty states
and I\'m very happy.

>The Vargr are particularly problematic though, and I\'m trying to

So, make them more the barbarian raiders that have no real interest
in conquest, just hit and run.

It\'s the Zhodani, Aslan, Hiver and K\'kree that are the real rub.
They hem the humanii in and prevent expansion and exploration.  If
you\'re going this far why don\'t you shrink these four, and the
Vargr, to minor states (or a large number of minor states in the
Vargr\'s case) with gaps between them.  It\'s in these gaps that the
species expand, explore, and interact with each other.

Now you have several game possibilities set up.  "Several frontiers"
for exploration and "wild and woolly" games.  A number of small
interacting states for diplomacy, trade, political type games.  And
with lots of small states the possibility of lots of very small
wars, for the PC\'s to get mixed up in...both in and out of service.

At full effect HEPlaR certainly would cut concrete (and most

using more reaction mass but with a lower velocity exhaust?

Didn\'t have to, since there were no intervening stopping points, and
jumping vessels in LoS cannot be intercepted until they reach the
heliopause and precipitate out... and can squawk the data.

HOWEVER, what you do is plot your timeline like so (Using Regina/SM subsector)

Standing orders
TG 1 to protect whanga
TG 2 is reinforcements for TG1, stationed at Efate, respond if enemy sited.

Week	ID#	Loc	Item
0	1*	1910	TG 1 Stationed at Whanga(1806) to proceed upon relief
			to Efate(1705)
0	2*	1910	TG 2 @ Efate(1705) to proc. whanga & relive TG 1
0	3*	1806	Enemy Vessel Sited Msg. Tgt: Efate(1705)
0	4*	1806	Enemy Vessel Sited Msg. Tgt: Regina (1910)

1	2	2007	TG 2 @ Efate(1705) to proc. whanga & relive TG 1 a.
1	4	2007	waypoint
2	1**	1806	TG 1 Stationed at Whanga(1806) to proceed upon relief
			to Efate(1705)
2	2	1903	TG 2 @ Efate(1705) to proc. whanga & relive TG 1
2	4**	1910	Enemy sited in Whanga turn 0
2	5*	1705	Inform HQ TG 2 proceeding to Whanga

3	5	1903	Inform HQ TG 2 proceeding to Whanga
3	6*	1806	TG2 arrived whanga
3	2	1705	TG 2 @ Efate(1705) to proc. whanga & relive TG 1

etc...

if something intercepts a thread, discontinue the thread ID# in all future
turns. Actions other than defense only occur when orders to do so arrive.
If using C/C++, chains of pointers are good ways. When an order/report
courier moves, simply move it\'s pointers to the chain for the new system.
(Each address holds a struct using
struct order
{	long ID
	short	target unit;
	short	dest hex;
	short	turn;
	short	action;
	struct *nextPtr;
	struct *prevPtr;
};

when the order is created, assign the ID; ID\'s do not get reused. Fill in
the data. Add it (with the appropriate turn number) to each hex\'s chain it
will go to. Each turn, check for couriers in held hexes; if eliminated
during combat, search all hexes for same ID, and use following bit to cut
it out:

// *currPtr should equal prevPtr->nextPrt and nextPtr->prevPtr
prevPtr = currPtr->prevPtr;
prevPtr->nextPtr = currPtr->nextPtr;
fre(&(*currPtr)); // whatever routine and format you call to recover a malloc\'d
		// bit of memory for re-use.


while I know the thoery, forget me actually doing the coding... but I want
to see C/C++ source (if C/C++ used) to see if I can port it to Mac.... Just
for Dom! (and me...)

Remember though that if you use the "original vector is retained" style of
jump drive you are still going to have a lot of maneuvering to do when you
come out of jump. So you will still need a good supply of fuel if using a
reaction drive.

Never underestimate the power of hypocrisy, or the ability of the human
mind to rationalise the indefensible.

I think it\'s unlikely he would have tried while Lucan and Margaret were
around.  It\'s more possible that he would make himself Regent while a
search was made for a suitable candidate for Emperor, in the same manner as
Arbellatra.  It\'s *very* likely that he would be offered the throne under
these circumstances.  Whether or not he would accept is another matter. 
Maybe he would regard it as his duty....

The route across the Great Rift is actually quite viable, once you assume,
or create, some *very* high capacity calibration points*.  You might have
trouble getting J-3 squadrons across, but J-4 shouldn\'t be too hard.  Of
course, ISTR that some of the big ship designs that were J-4 in CT were J-3
in MT.  Tanker squadrons might help.

I don\'t own FFW.  What are the jump capabilities in it like?

As for the Vargr....   Well, *someone* has to sack Capital, don\'t they?

Alan Bradley
alanb@elf.brisnet.org.au

*calibration points are fuel caches in interstellar space, usually owned by
the Navy, and not available to, and kept secret from, civilian users.  They
get used heavily in Regency Sourcebook, and, I gather, in Arrival
Vengeance.  Of course, in some Traveller games it\'s not possible to do deep
space jumps like this.

The problem is that if you analyse the descrition of Vargr and Aslan
society we have, the dangerous part of the two constitute a very small
fraction of the total. Starships are expensive. Even 40-year old obsolescent
starships are expensive. If an Aslan clan lord were to outfit a sizable
number of his _ihatei_ AND ESCORTED THEM OFF SOMEWHERE 100 PARSECS AWAY, he
wouldn\'t have the strength to defend himself against any neighbor that
kept his warships at home and used his troop transports to ferry a lot
more _ihatei_ over to that that nice, well-developed, undefended land
right next door, that he could ever hope to send off to settle 100 parsecs
away (where any colony that survives is unable to add their strength to
help defend his home holdings).

Of course, if the Aslans give their _ihatei_ obsolescent ships (which canon
says they do), they have the added disadvantage of being in worse shape
than most colonial and all regular fleets, and of inferior TL too.
 
Vargr Corsairs are a small fraction of any Vargr society. The _Kforuzeng_,
said to be the largest band in Gvurrdon, at its height couldn\'t muster
enough ships to give a single light cruiser trouble. Granted that the
Rebellion Era apparently saw some Vargr light cruisers turn corsair, they
still shouldn\'t be able to match the Domain _peacetime_ navy.

Now up the Domain spending from peacetime levels (said to be 3% of GWP, but
apparently only 1%) to wartime level (15%), and you have to wonder how the
hell the Vargr corsairs managed to kick Norris completely out of three
subsectors.

As for overrunning Corridor, well, if you go through the Megatraveller
Journals, you will find that most of the high-population planets didn\'t
actually fall to the Vargr. Mostly they reached various forms of
accomodation (Norris may actually face more problems with human pocket
empires in Corridor than Vargr).

Maybe, but propably not. The warrant is said to make him Commander-in-Chief
of the forces in the Marches. MY take is that something as powerful as
that would be hedged with a lot of safeguards, including an expiration
date. YMMV, but certainly Norris\' musings in _Survival Margin_ seem to
indicate that he thought himself on shaky ground (though fully justified).
Didn\'t he actually write something about comemorating Strephon by taking
his name in vain?

I know that in _The Kinunir_ we are told that an Imperial Warrant is an
anonymous "get out of anything free" card made out to bearer. If you want
to believe that, feel free. But I prefer to regard this particular piece
of canon as on a par with the information that four Kinunirs are strong
enough to cow the entire Regina subsector...

Since I brought it up, I guess I should answer, at least to the best of my 
memory until I can take a look at MTJ4.

It was supposed to be an alliance of sorts, marriage was suggested, between 
Margaret and Dulinor.  As I saw it, it was going to be the net that drew 
the Imperium back together.

At least that is what I think I remember reading...

IIRC, T-plates give off quantities of heat and light in addition to their
reactionless drive capabilities, probably due to some inefficiencies
in application of the theory. These quantities can apparently, at least
on takeoff, be fatal to exposed personnel (see the Traveller scenario
_Exit Visa_ from _The Traveller Book_).

I assume the choice of standard materials rather than expensive was deliberate
for YTU reasons. This would have saved a few tons though pushed the price up
considerably.

I got Radscanner 500 lbs, 10cf, $200,000.

IR/Thermograph/Passive Radar are already included in PESA.

The PESA and radscanner are a significant portion of the price tag. I would be
tempted to cut corners to bring the price down and reduce these a couple of scan
ratings.

This is an interface shuttle right? Have you considered making it battery
operated? A couple of hours stored power would weigh half as much, cost 5/8 as
much and only occupy 1/8 the space. Enough to get into orbit and CG/fly back for
a recharge!

>Space Performance : sAcc 0.656 g, sDec 0.656 g, sMR 0.656

This is quite ambitious for this TL! I think a little less performance would
save a great deal of price.

Keep up the good work.

Maybe that\'s why it\'s hard to get anything done by them...
it\'s easy to lose interest or just plain forget what\'s going on.

Having said that, PBEM isn\'t impossible: just slow, and
if you can handle once-monthly postings with occasional
flurries, then it can be an enjoyable and low-bandwidth
diversion.

The point is, you shouldn\'t expect to go anywhere with
it -- in general.  Scale down your expectations and you\'ll
be fine.

Seems to me that e-mail is most productive when people
are talking rather than transacting.  It\'s kind of halfway
between letter-writing and chat channels.  It\'s like
conversational bowling rather than conversational
volleyball.  You watch the other people, then they watch
you.  Comments may follow, but there\'s no efficient way
to do a tete-a-tete.

What I\'d like to see is some local color spewed from all
you creative, imaginitive folks out there.  Pick a world in
the Spinward Marches, read up on it from whatever
source material you prefer to use, and write up an anecdote
about a character\'s experience with some facet of the world\'s
people.

Or better, have something akin to THUDDD -- a moderator
picks a world, and each PC writes up an experience s/he
had on that world (or in system).  This adds 1) color, and
2) adventure hooks.

Actually, it was to prevent flamer wars on what is acceptable and 
what is not.  Those who know enough about the system to make the 
changes make them.  Those who don\'t, don\'t.  IMTU, we use 
differing hull types.  But these shuttles were for the general masses. 
It is too much work to make 25 different iterations of the shuttle to 
cover all possibilities.

Yes, you are correct.  This is a glaring error.  This is repeated in all 
shuttles.  I\'ll repost to my website when I have them corrected so as 
to not use up bandwidth here.

Well, I though about that.  Honest.  But, when in orbit, distances are 
a wee bit farther than they are dirtside.  This gives the little extra 
range to help navigate and avoid other shuttles.

Thought about that, too.  But I wanted more than a couple hours of 
flight time.  They may make runs to a trojan point or to the 100D limit 
or just about anywhere else.  And on heavy G worlds, the thrust may 
not be enough to make it into orbit in that time.  Just taking it up to a 
1.3 G world and you now have to spend 1.2 hours making orbit.  
Make the world bigger, too, and it takes even longer.  This shuttle, 
with its constant power source, can handle a much broader range of 
possibilities.  That\'s not to say that there aren\'t custom jobs out 
there.

Normal GT cockpit/systems bridges only have one.  I was following

That is the only drawback I can find to using fissionables.  They\'re

The only ones I know about are the small craft; like air/rafts and I am

Well, I am glad you liked them.  I, personally, feel they fill a gap.  
You could own a little fleet of these and maneuver around a busy 
shipyard where the larger ones might not be able to.

It may be worth looking at the SCTA list on onelist (the CT starships list)
which is already in the midst of a TCS Islands game. All the rules
decisions should be in the archives?

This is an escape craft for use with large starships. It is fairly
small and cheap, the main drawback being that it is a little slow to
be filled during an emergency. Also, while it has a nominal crew of
two, both must enter a low berth as quickly as possible.

They both shift nears the same way.  A relative change in the roll
vs the target number (one does one, the other does the other).
The only difference is that in MT the shift is labels with descriptive
terms.  That is more consistent only to the degree that different
GMs understand the terms in the same way.

A tabulation would be nice for GT, since so many GM\'s are used to
it.  For GURPS Basic its less clear since you would have to
establish a concensus on what the terms mean.  However, it
probably would be worthwhile as an offered tool for those who
want it.

I\'m not sure what you mean.  A task description for what it takes
to perform a jump only applies to what it takes to perform a jump.
Just as the description of what it takes to perform a jump in GT
only applies to what it takes to perform a jump.

It has plusses and minuses.  It is easier, it also gets the player
immediately equating "difficult" with a target number and thinking
in game mechanic terms.  Either way, though, it isn\'t a big deal.

Off of what base?  And how many do you shift?  This is not clear
at all to me.

I haven\'t kept track of who posted what.  All I know was that when
I pointed out that to describe GURPS as laking wrt to MT is wrong
and that it is mostly a matter of approach and perferences, I got
replies insisting that this wasn\'t true.  The later replies started
conceding that there might be some good things in the GURPS approach,
but I saw little of that to begin with too.

OTOH, I\'ve said several
times that I\'m can see that the GT task system isn\'t what MT/TNE/T4
players are used to and not what they expect, and I have had few people
saying, "yeah that is what I\'m saying".  Now maybe we both haven\'t
been clear in what we are saying, but I do think there is an
unwillingness to accept that, objectively, the GURPS task system
is just as good as the ones in MT/TNE/T4.  But if you want to agree
that it mostly a case of approach and perference, each with their
own plusses and minuses, then maybe we can reach a concensus.

Are you kidding?  I\'ve letting this "GURPS is lacking a task system"
bunk for months (a year or two?) before I got fed up enough with it to say
anything...

Sounds like, his best move would be to cross the Rift and hook up with Craig. 
 If he could sidestep Corridor, he could even pick up troops and ships from 
the Aslan that Craig got close to...  Interesting...

My take on \'calibration points\' is that they\'re canonical IMTU cause they 
were canonical in the OTU (ref: \'Twilight\'s Peak\' and the course of the _Gyro 
Cadiz_).  So what\'s the problem?

Tanker squadrons would be required, just to keep the CP fueled.  A BatRon
can suck down a million or two displacement tons of fuel easily.  So can
a TankRon that\'s coming back for more fuel.  If you need to pass through
more than one CP, it\'ll be tricky to keep them supplied.

> I don\'t own FFW.  What are the jump capabilities in it like?

Imperial BatRons are J3/J4, selected CruRons are J5 or even J6.  (Colonials
and Planetary are much slower.)  TankRons are J3.  AssaultRons are J4.  The
TankRons are useful more to speed up refueling time in some situations than
to make jumps into deep space due to the way the rules work.

Who says the ships go just one way and never come back?  A lord could cut a 
deal where his ihatei are transported out of his hair, and the ships he wants 
to keep come back to him.  The rest can stay with that group of ihatei he 
just got rid of.

Giving ihatei 2nd line ships to work with is actually a *good* thing for the 
Hierate in that it promotes new shipbuilding.

Thing is, the Marches fleet is still in the rebuilding phase.  Remember that

True.  But all the Vargr had to do was cut off the high pop worlds and 
blockade them a bit until they geeked.

IIRC, not having the canonical info right in front of me at this moment, a
Warrant basically says "You are ordered to help the bearer in any way you can
because he is working for the best interests of the Imperium."  The implication
is that the bearer *will* have to give an accounting down the line someplace.
If he does the job right, he\'s a hero.  If he screws the pooch, he\'s less than
zero.  The Warrant puts the full responsibility *and* blame on the bearer.
Ghods help him if he screws up.

Actually, it\'s been effective against shaped-charge rounds since GURPS Ultra 
Tech, 2nd Edition (1992 I think). Don\'t know about UT 1/e.

You could also argue that thermal superconducting armor has no place in GT, 
as it isn\'t part of CT or MT (I\'d support banning it for this reason alone).

Note: In Star Mercs, it notes that TS armor can only give a maximum bonus of 
+ 250 DR, regardless of the actual DR of the "normal" armor. Also worth 
mentioning that the grav tanks use metal rather than laminate armor.

A generous and sadistic GM,

All true, but with enough time and determination, and with the right
group to truly phenomenal players, you can accomplish great things!

Case in point, visit "The Home of the TML PBeM" (possibly the longest
running PBeM in internet history), at:

    http://www.ssgfx.com/traveller

If you visit the archives, you\'ll find roughly 4-5 paperback novels
worth of prose, reflecting years of play.  We\'re damn proud of it!!

Done mostly for cost reasons; what with removal of \'advanced\' armor at TL 12 I may generate rewrites which use laminate armor.

"Lost Supplements" project. I will post what will hopefully be a final

from Bill regarding Andrews passing in its entirety below.

In Sorrow,
Paul Sanders

********************************************* 

Good Morning Paul,

I\'ve got some bad news, I\'m afraid. My brother, Andrew, is dead.

He died during the early morning hours of Saturday, August 7th. I\'d gone
over on Friday evening in response to a phone call, saw that he was not
well, and called 911. They got him to the hospital okay, but he died a
couple of hours later. The cause of death was listed as massive double
pulmonary thrombosis -- blood clots in both lungs.

We had his mail routed to my address so we could take care of any remaining
business on his docket, so we received your latest payment to him a few
days ago. I am returning the money order to you.

I know he was pleased to see our old Traveller work coming to light again;
he often spoke of you. I am sorry he can\'t take part in any more of the
future projects you two had planned.

I\'m sorry, too, for the suddenness and bluntness of this news. His death,
frankly, struck out of the blue. He\'d not been sick beyond some nagging,
low-grade complaints and flu-like symptoms... and a fainting spell the week
before that we attributed to the heat. I learned later he\'d had some
shortness of breath that previous week -- always a bad sign that should be
checked -- but he told no one.

He will be missed.

Good luck, sir, on your future Travelling endeavors. Let me know if there\'s
anything I can do to help.

Cordially,
Bill Keith

Wouldn\'t the neutrino density from total conversion be enough to kill people, or

I know the feeling, but "expensive" is the default material. I thought it was
only Advanced Armour (flinch) that makes people testy. I guess TL9 armour has
yet to be fought over. Though with it covering TTLs 9 to 11 I would have thought

TCS = Trillion Credit Squadron, Traveller Adventure 5 by GDW.

I intend to run the campaign from the book set in the New and Old Islands
Subsectors, (J &K inthe Reft Sector.  Basically, the players control one of
the major world in the region (and any colonies it may have), and have a
HUGE budget to design the existing fleet for that power using Bk5 High Guard
(2nd Edition).  War then breaks out and the fleets advance (or retreat <g>),
constuction of new ships is undertaken, the economy ramps up to a full war
footing, much fun ensues.

Esperanza ( Pop A TL B ), New Colchis, Joyeuse, Serendip Belt (Asteroid
Belt), Neuybayern, New Home (Pop 8 TL D), Amondiage, Sansterre. Unless
stated all are Pop 9 TL C

I\'m currently scanning the essential parts of TCS (Campaign Rules &
Background), and will send copies to those players who do not have a copy of
their own, on the strict understanding that the copies are for use only in
the game and are not for redistribution or resale etc etc.  I hope to get
this done over the weekend.

Currently 6 players including you have expressed an interest as I write, so
at the moment everyone can have a faction to themselves if they want. I\'m
keeping strict track of who contacted me in which order, and the earlier the
contact the more senior the admiral if it comes to teams for factions.

I hope this has answered some of your questions. If yo have others, please
let me know.

BTW, IMTU I *do* allow deep-space jumps, so fuel caches / secret bases can
be established in \'empty\' hexes, but only once play has commenced. (Just
hope the location doesn\'t fall into the wrong hands.....)

All the best,

Matt

a consensus as to a GURPS Traveller task system?

I\'m thinking of something that mirrors the MegaTraveller system, in which
tasks have a standard verbal label which lets players know what their
target number is. Assuming that I understand GURPS correctly*, this would
best be done by having a standard set of dice modifiers that alter the
player\'s roll (leaving the target number unchanged at their skill level).

MegaTraveller had Simple, Routine, Difficult, Formidable, and Impossible.

"Impossible" was (IMHO) a mistake, as there is a big difference between an
impossible task requiring a great roll and lots of DMs and an impossible
task that can\'t be done. I\'d suggest using a different word, unless
continuity is considered more important.

It strikes me that we could get the MT effect for GT by chosing one task
difficulty level as the base, and then having a standard modifier from
there. Would "Routine" be the best level for an unmodified skill throw?





*A big assumption, as I\'ve never actually played using the GURPS rules,
only GMed with players who knew nothing about the system.

Isn\'t it both CT (Traveller Adventure), MT (Arrival Vengeance), TNE
(Regency Sourcebook) and T4 (Pocket Empires) canon that deep space jumps
are possible?

Even if you use the gravitational limit stuff from Far Trader you could use
dark mass / deep comets / etc to achieve this, much as Cherryh does.

I think it\'s only TL12 Advanced materials that are causing people problems.
 Lower TL advanced materials should be OK.  For example, TL11 Advanced
armor is the same as TL12 Expensive, so there\'s no reason it shouldn\'t
exist. 

> BTW what does TURLFB mean? and where are Flight Recorders in GV2?

It\'s shorthand for the various faces on a vehicle: Top, Underside, Right,
Left, Front, Back.  It took me a minute to figure this out too; normally
you only really need to use these tags if the armor values are different on
different faces.

Flight Recorders are inexplicably located in the Audiovisual Systems
section (p56), interchangeable with stereo systems.  An odd choice, IMO.

First, let\'s give descriptions of what we think these mean:
Simple: can reasonably be done by someone unskilled, with trial and error.
Routine: can be done by anyone trained to moderate competency.  An expert will do it right almost every time.
Difficult: Someone with moderate training would be lucky to do this at all.  An expert might require multiple attempts.
Formidable: only an expert has a chance at this one, and not a great chance.
\'Impossible\': only someone of exceptional skill has even a chance of accomplishing this task.

Given GURPS meanings, those would be:
Simple: +5 (most people can default and succeed)
Routine: +0 (anyone skill 10+ will probably succeed eventually)
Difficult: -5 (an expert, with skill 16+, may need multiple attempts)
Formidable: -10 (someone who is brilliant, with 20- skill, might fail)
Impossible: -15 (in a realistic setting, skills above 20 basically don\'t occur, so no-one has a significant chance of success).

A side point is that GTL 10 is traveller TL 12-13; if it is traveller TL 12 it probably shouldn\'t have access to \'advanced\' materials either.  Since merchant craft in traveller tend to be built at traveller TL 12, they probably shouldn\'t use advanced materials either.

I think that is, quite literally, going too far!

I would tend to assume that there is only a few places where the Rift can
be crossed, most of which can be guessed at by looking at Atlas of the
Imperium.   IIRC, it\'s quite easy for Norris to join up with Strephon,  but
quite difficult for him to join up with anyone else.  (I\'m not sure if that
is coincidental.)

Joining up with Craig means going through the Aslan, or Strephon *and*
Dulinor.

Yes, the logistics of all this would be pretty serious.  That\'s why it
doesn\'t happen very often.

I\'ve always considered Arbellatra\'s march to the Core as being through
Corridor, with Soegz leading a column on her coreward flank, clearing out
corsairs.  Olav\'s march would have been through Corridor too.

I figure that the whole idea is pretty sensitive to advances in Jump
technology.  In Cleon\'s day, the Rift would have been much more of a
barrier.  (And there would have been nowhere to go to.)

But then - there *is* a famous military rift-crossing in canon.  This is
the Julian seizure of the Antares cluster, behind the Imperial front lines.
 This required going across the Lesser Rift, which wasn\'t all that "lesser"
in practical terms, especially given the, at best, TL12 ships involved.

If Norris\' fleet gets away with a rift-crossing like this, it would go down
in the history books.  If they are then destroyed, it would be like the
Russian Navy sailing around the world prior to the battle of Tsushima....

Thanks for the info.  I thought that this was the likely range of figures.

The rules for TankRons probably don\'t matter in this case, unless someone
got really crazy and fought a whole Imperium-wide civil war!  Mmm.  The
Rebellion as FFW/Imperial Squadrons PBEM game....  (Drool...)

*** 
THE ETERNAL LEGIONNAIRE

Make haste to the ramparts, men of the Legion!
Slam shut the gates and prepare for the storm!
The hard-riding horsemen of Mexico\'s rebels
Have run you to ground here at grim Camerone!

	One band of heroes must hold out against them,
	Hireling soldiers of every nation,
	Who stand in the name of France though she has scorned them,
	And stand for the pride of the Foreign Legion!

Hasten to arms, men of the Second,
And keep alive one spark of old liberties!
The Emperor\'s host has besieged Areopolis,
Spreading destruction and foul tyranny!

	Though you are cast-offs and misfits and exiles,
	Though you\'re outnumbered and badly outgunned,
	You\'ll hold back the Empire until you go under,
	And die for the pride of the Foreign Legion!

Hasten to battle, to die for the Empire,
Fighting a lost cause on stark Ganymede!
Bold Marshal F\'Rujuk will lead the resistance,
Driven by oaths and the Warrior\'s Creed.

	Men of the Third check their spacesuits and rifles,
	Still waging war though their comrades have run,
	Honor, Fidelity, Duty still bind them,
	To stand for the pride of the Foreign Legion!

Hasten to action, down from your caverns,
Legionnaires trapped here on fair Deveraux!
The Semti have cut off the Fourth Foreign Legion,
And left it alone to face Man\'s greatest foe!

	Every man knows he\'s destined to die here,
	Under the light of a far distant sun,
	So we\'ll make a last raid and at least go down fighting,
	And maintain the pride of the Foreign Legion!

Hasten to muster the Fifth Foreign Legion!
Mount your Sandrays and rev up your fans!
The black ships have landed, disgorging battalions
Of glittering Ubrenfar warrior clans!

	Soldiers of Terra\'s Colonial Army,
	Heirs to the ancient and proud tradition,
	The battlefield calls you to Honor and Glory,
	To fight for the pride of the Foreign Legion!

Believe it or not, these are the exact ones I started out with ... and 
said, "Now I need one for TL8 and TL9."  That\'s how I ended up 
with the versions I have now.  And you are correct, it is entirely 
possible to build 5 dTon ships at GTL10 ... you just need the hull.

As are as the detail ... it will be cut down as things mature.  I have 
been brow-beat about that already :)

<1> I added the something, that I thought was missing from your

David, we\'ve discussed this before.  As I said then, for *me* GURPS
*is* missing something fundamental.  Not for you, not for many
GURPSians, maybe only for a few strange people like me, but for
however many of us there are it is missing something.  

Speaking just for myself, I prefer a *descriptive* task system.  As
the GM, I don\'t want my players thinking about numbers or rule
mechanics.  I want them thinking, in character, about how hard tasks
are to accomplish using descriptive terms..."Oh, that\'s an Easy
lock, I\'ll crack it in a second.", "I don\'t think I should try,
that, it\'s a Formidable task." or "I know that\'s going to be next to
Impossible, but I have to try!"  I find this easier to accomplish
with systems that have task descriptions.

And frankly, I just plain like task descriptions better than numeric
DM\'s.  You obviously don\'t.  Cum se, cum sa...isn\'t that the
expression?

As for slamming GURPS, you won\'t see me doing that.  I generally
like the system.  Sure, there are things about it I would change,
but you should know by now that I\'d say that about *any* system.

I\'ve been too busy playing to keep up with all the posts on the TML

Advanced material exists at any TL. But merchant craft at any TL probably
shouldn\'t use them, because they are too expensive to be worth it.

It\'s based on the perceived motion of a body (star) against the background

standard. Using this standard, an object which would appear to shift

1arcsecond, as the nearest stars are just over a parsec away, and it can
only be actually measured directly for relatively nearby stars IIRC.
However, these stars include some variables that vary in absolute magnitude
in a very regular way (Cephid\'s?). As we know the distance to them very
accurately, we can use similar stars further away to determine fairly
accurate distances to objects in the \'fixed\' background. I think... Plus

Alas, this *won\'t* work. At least not they way they were shown doing
it. The first ejaculation will have a normal sperm count. The second
and succeeding ones will have drastrically lower ones, until the point
where all you get is a few drops of seminal fluid. 

And for that matter, there are better ways to collect it, if you don\'t
give a damn about the "donor". Standard practice with animals involves
an electric shock applied to the prostate and surrounding tissues. Send
a few such shocks and the "reservior" is quickly pumped dry. Then wait
a few hours or days and repeat.

Such methods have been used to get sperm from paraplegics. And even
*they* found it uncomfortable. And it was necessaru to try it on a few
normal volunteers to get the settings right. Apparently it\'s on a par
with getting hit in the balls by a sledgehammer. 

Still, I can see *some* society trying to use it. 

Notice to Starfarers regarding planet Amazonia:

"Warning: Any male caught outside the extrality fence becomes state
 property and will be used as a sperm donor...."

I think Spider Robinson stated that a "wish" is semantically equivalent
to "booby trap". 

And John Brunner went even farther in "The Traveller In Black". There\'s
a *reason* that the players in my old D&D game who\'d read that story

"As you wish, so be it."

Ditto for the "waif look". The lack of body fat reserves (and muscle
mass) is also a killer in pregnancy and later during nursing.

This is a common scenario in fiction. Alas, it requires that those
doing the investigating be bright enough to spot your planted clues,
but dumb enough to not spot any *real* clues, nor to notice any
discrepancies in your planted clues.

In this case, they won\'t just take the mercs word for it. They\'ll
*have* to track down the folks who paid them. And if they are middlemen
also, continue to follow the chain until the find the person who
*ordered* this. 

BTW, rather than a mass driver on a moon, a ship boosting in from *way*
out in the outer system is better. Because unless detected *very*
early, there\'s no way to capture it. It could be *destroyed*, but not
captured. So no physical evidence will exist other than what remote
senors can pick up. 

And you can have it beam a "statement" giving credit to the appropriate
terrorist group (or blaming some action of the planet) to a satellite
shortly before impact. 

This lessens exposure greatly.

Well, in Traveller, it just means you have to keep track of which ships
have copies of what messages, and work the propagation as the ships jump.

For in-system, lightspeed sensors and coms, the messages and sensor
pulse are going to have to be kept track of as expanding rings or
spheres. 

For a computerized game, I\'d say the "tactical" display ought to work
something like what CJ Cherryh describes in the Chanur books. That is,
you drop into the system, and you pickup whatever has reached your
location. Meanwhile there\'s an expanding circle moving across the
display from your entry point. Anyone inside it, has detected you.
Anyone outside it, can\'t know about you yet. 

As the circle crosses known planets and stations, return circles
radiate, indicating their response to detecting you. Or perhaps a
second circle propoogates at half lightspeed, indicating the area that
your *active* sensors have data for, as well as the places that have
had a chance to respond to you. 

Any messages you sent would be either circles or segments of circles
depending on whether they were broadcast or aimed. 

I\'d probably "pair" circles by color to help keep things straight as
well as have some function for automaticly deleting "old" circles, as
well as selectiviely and *temporarily* suppressing display of ones you
didn\'t care about at the moment.

2 AU. But that\'s the base of the overall triangle.

For example, for something 1 parsec away, the triangle would have
angles of 89deg 59 min 59.5 sec at each end of the base, and the
remaining angle would be 1 second. Giving the triangle a 2 AU base, and
an altitude of 1 parsec.

For the right triangle that is *half* of this triangle, you have a 1 AU
side, and a 1 parsec side, meeting to form the 90 deg angle. The angle
between the hypotenuse and the short side is still 89 deg 59 min 59.5
sec. The angle between the hypotenuse and the *long* side is .5 seconds
of arc. 

So for using the trig functions to convert the angles to lengths, you
have a 1 AU "base" (short side) for a right triangle. And half as big
an angle at the far end.

Also, judicious selection of the point you jump *from* and the point
you jump *to* should help minimize the "extra" manuevering. 

For example, boost to jump such that if you come out exactly on time
and one schedule, you\'ll be moving towards the planet at a moderate
velocity when you exit jump. Then when you exit, you just correct for
the error in time & space. 

This has the advantage that there will be areas around the 100 diameter
limit that are the "best" point to jump to specific neighboring systems
from. And a "best" point to aim at in the destination system. Thus you
get traffic concentrated enough to make piracy a bit more workable.

But you can still retain the ability to jump from *anywhere*, it\'ll
just cost more manuever fuel on the other end.

So you anonymously pay a small band of mercenaries to do it and set it up so it
looks like your enemy did it. Then let the Imperium do your dirty work for you.
See the Starfall scenario from White Dwarf 64 April 1985, written for Star Trek,

I have been holding this scenario in reserve and now you tell me it\'s illegal!

I must admit confusion as to the design method used for the Commando
Battledress and how it fits into the design system. I recently picked up
Ultra-Tech and Ultra-Tech 2. I hoped that these volumes would help banish my
confusion, but no luck.

Ultra Tech describes Powered Combat (GTL10) armor as having a DR of ~DR 100.
(DR varies over the suit. This is the torso value.) GT (p.118) specifies
that Improved Battledress has DR 250 (torso/head), but incorporates a
superconductor layer with gives it double DR against laser and PGMP/FGMP
weapons resulting in an effective DR of 500 against these weapons or rather
their damage would be halved and the result determined by using the armors
normal DR. This is at GTL11. It also uses advanced laminate and so halves
damage due to shaped explosive charges. This is in line with UT (p.78) and
UT2 (p.76).

So where did DR 1200 come from? Did the designer use GURPS Vehicle\'s
battlesuit design rules to create the commando armor? Who did the design?
And how does the +250 DR come in? Does this mean that against energy weapons
Commando Battledress has a DR of 1200+250=1450 or is the DR 250+250=500
against energy weapons no matter that the actual DR is? This would give the
suit DR 500 vs. energy weapons, effective DR 2400 against shaped charges
(because of the advanced laminate rule from UT2 (p.76) and DR 1200 against
impaling damage. And any impaling damage that penetrates the armor is, I
believe doubled (GB p.73).

Oh, Crap!!! How did I miss that?!?!?  I must have got my armor and 
structural material confused during design.  Thanks for correcting

What happens when the weapons are smarter than the operators? There

I\'d imagine that there are a whole lot more neutrinos involved in a

IIRC it worked. Maybe not practical or elegant but more mobile than

<tongue-in-cheek>
That being the case, how well did you like the original Marvel Super
Hero system by TSR, the one where *everything* was put into descriptive
terms? If I remember the progression correctly (it\'s been a while),
it went: Feeble, Typical, Good, Excellent, Remarkable, Incredible, 
Amazing, Monstrous, Unearthly. So an easy task (opening an unlocked
door) would require a roll against the Feeble or Typical column,
while a really hard one (flying at full speed through an asteroid
field while being chased by a fleet of enemy fighters -- blindfolded)
would be Monstrous or Unearthly. Think we could adapt this to Traveller?
</tongue-in-cheek>

Well, what better source of information about future tech than the
future?  After all, according to GURPS, we\'ll enter GURPS TL8 in just a
couple of months (see _Murphy\'s Rules_, 1998 edition, page 36).

The real-time chat and messaging stuff is pretty simple.

As a small part of the 3-day Java course I teach, the students get to write
a chat-client. It takes most of them no more than half an hour to write
their client which they test against a pre-written server. However when I
first sat the course the guy taking it knew I was only there to learn the
course for future teaching, so got me to write the server instead of the
client. in the same time frame.

Hardest part for a good game like this will be the GUI, and getting the
graphics done, followed by translating the rules into machine lingo. It\'s
sometimes amazing how difficult it is to get a machine to understand a one
line rule that a human will understand with no trouble.

Despite the cost in volume, you\'re probably better off burning LH2,
rather than diesel fuel, alcohol, or any other carbon-containing fuel. 
On board a spacecraft, extra water can be useful, extra CO2 or CO much
less so.  Try both LH2/O2 burning engines of various types, and LH2/O2
fuel cells, and see which one give the most power for the least
volume/mass/cost.  (I haven\'t crunched these numbers, so I haven\'t the
foggiest idea.)

Okay, here\'s my take, and I know it is similar to the BITS system.
Dom and I talked about that last year when this came up. <g>

  -6 Easy
  -3 Routine
   0 Difficult
  +3 Formidable
  +6 Staggering
  +9 Hopeless
 +12 *Impossible

*Impossible isn\'t *quite* impossible, but effectively so.

Analysis:

Traveller PC\'s aren\'t generally "super heroes" so they aren\'t going
to have extremely high Skill levels.  However, I would expect them
to range from about 10 to 16.  So, for this analysis I took an
average Stat of 10 and modified it to reflect Little training (4 to
6 pts giving a skill level of 10), Reasonable training (6 to 16 pts
giving a skill level of 13) and Highly trained (20+ pts giving a
skill level of 16).  I also used a -6 default for having absolutely
no training and got the following effective Skill Levels to test...

Totally untrained  -6  (4)
A little training   0  (10)
Reasonable training 3  (13)
Highly trained      6  (16)

Easy

   Description:  Things that almost anyone should be able to do.
   
   Effect:  They a virtual lock if you have *any* training in that
   skill and a toss up for the untrained.

Routine 

   Description:  Things that everyone with *training* in this skill
   should do easily.
   
   Effect:  Tasks are still a virtual lock with any training, but
   only rarely will the untrained succeed.

Difficult 

   Description:  Things that are easy for the highly trained, but
   are hard for those with little training in that skill
   
   Effect:  Tasks are a lock only for the highly trained, and are
   still very easy for a reasonably trained PC, but with only a
   little training, it\'s a toss up, and the untrained should try
   this only in a *real* emergency.

Formidable 

   Description:  Things that are getting hard for all but the *very*
   highly trained and now those with only a little training will
   fail most of the time.
   
   Effect:  Tasks are easy for the highly trained, but only a toss
   up for the reasonably trained PC, everyone else should forget it.

Staggering 

   Description:  Things that are hard for everyone and only
   the highly trained have a reasonable chance of success.
   
   Effect:  Tasks are truly staggering with highly trained only
   succeeding half the time, everyone else will very rarely succeed.

Hopeless 

   Description:  Things that even the most highly trained will fail
   at most of the time.

   Effect:  Tasks are effectively hopeless for everyone with even
   the highly trained failing over 80% of the time.

Impossible 

   Description:  Effectively impossible, only extreme luck allows
   anyone to pull this off.
   
   Effect:  Tasks aren\'t completely impossible, but they are the
   next thing to it for *everybody!*

You can pull your tongue out of your cheek, now!  ;-p I\'m familar
with MSHAG, and liked the concept, but didn\'t like the
implementation.  I\'ve like a lot of TSR concepts, but haven\'t liked
one of there game systems since the original D&D. And, yes, I like

    I\'m a redleg, an artilleryman, by training, so it\'s not my job to say
this, in
fact, St. Barbara forgive me for admitting it, but the day of the "poor dumb
grunt" is already past.  Today\'s modern infantryman can be successful
if uneducated, but the "knotheads" will wash out in training for the most
part.  The average may get through training, but will never be more than
long-service privates.  Small-unit tactical leader (i.e. squad-leader) is
probably the hardest job in the military today.  One reason the modern
infantry has such a poor retention rate is that large numbers of people do
one hitch, realize they aren\'t hacking it, and transfer to a less demanding
MOS.

A parsec is the distance at which the position of a star, as observed
from Earth at opposite side\'s of Earth\'s orbit, will show a parallax
(shift against the background stars) of one second of arc. 

Parsec is just shorthand for "parallax of one second".

As such, the size of the parsec is *directly* tied to the size of the
AU (raduius of Earth\'s orbit). Specifically:

1 parsec = arctan(89 deg 59 min 59 sec) AU
1 parsec = 206,264.7897 AU

The above is the *definition* of a parsec. (well, actually, it should
be the arc-cotangent of 1 second, but that\'s nit-picking)

1 AU is *approximately* 150 million km. Therefore:

1 parsec = ~30.93971846e15 m
1 parsec = ~103e6 light seconds
         = ~1.7e6 light minutes
         = ~28.6e3 light hours
         = ~1.19e3 light days
         = ~3.26 light years

But it has a *very* undesirable side effect. It converts all of the
C-141 and similar cargo planes into high priority targets. Something
similar happened at the end of WWII.

I used to know a guy who was navigator on a B-29 in the Pacific in
WWII. His plane got assigned weather flights in July of 45. They\'d fly
over several Japanese cities to get weather data, and then return to
base. The Japanese would fire some flak at them, just to let them know
they weren\'t being ignored, but otherwise they\'d leave them alone. 

Things went on like this until their flight on Aug 7th(?) (the day
*after* Hiroshima). All of a sudden, the Japanese were throwing
everything but the kitchen sink at them. And they had no idea why!

Nagasaki made it even worse, but at least by then, the word had gotten
around. 

The same thing would happen with those C-141s. They\'d be considered a
"strategic platform", and thus become *high* priority targets.

Actually, you only get real time chat if you are at the same *planet*.
Otherwise the lag is simply too long.

You can send email between planets, with delays on a par with current
internet mail. But *talking* requires a lag of no more than a few
seconds. And that\'s a *miniscule* distance in space.

1 AU is very close to being 500 light seconds. Or 1000 seconds of time
lag. So if 5 seconds lag is max workable, that means you have to be
within 1/200th of an AU of someone to talk. That\'s about 750,000 km.
about 2.5 times the distance to the moon. 

So any message "server" has to store messages until they have had long
enough to reach the destination. Since the destination may be
manuevering, that means that you have to test for the point at which
the co-ordinates of the destination are within the expanding circle
covered by the message.

Yes.  And they failed to consider whether the results from Vehicles made
any sense, which they don\'t.

I assume it was one of the authors.  Certainly it was not done by anyone on
the playtest, since we never saw the designs for any of the vehicles.

A thermal superconducting layer doubles the DR of armor against energy
weapons (and sadly HEAT rounds), but Star Merc adds the caveat that it adds
no more than 250 points.  (IOW, a DR100 battlesuit would only get an
additional 100 DR from a superconducting layer, and a DR250 suit gets 250
additional DR, but DR1200 commando armor only gets an additional 250.)


 This would give the
> suit DR 500 vs. energy weapons, 

No: it gets DR 1450 vs energy weapons as you write above.  Conventional
armor is still effective against energy weapons to its full value.

effective DR 2400 against shaped charges

Yes.

and DR 1200 against

Yes, but remember that most bullets are not impaling weapons.  Depending on
caliber and bullet type, some will behave like impaling weapons behind
armor, but others (armor piercing, for example) will have damage that
penetrates armor reduced instead.

Jesse and Evyn, prerhaps some others, but I\'m still on my first

me for pointing that out? Will you bother to fix it? It\'s such a nitpicky

some might be. I see you got my URL up there though, thanks!

I don\'t disagree with you. Intelligent soldiers have been better
soldiers ever since volley fire tactics became impractical. There are
still many knotheads around. Ft. Bragg was inundated with them. It
appears to me the more intelligent (or educated) recruits are pulled
towards the technical jobs.

    'body' => 'Some have expressed some curiosity as to why the 
Coordinator is assigning Key-codes.

The reason the Coordinator wants everyone to have 
their own Key-code(s) is so that their designs can be 
properly placed by the robots.  Correct placement is 
vital to making the links work properly.  Your 
Key-code is what the robots will use to designate 
your designs in each of the upcoming THUDDDs.  By 
introducing a standard (the Key-codes), you will be 
able to write everything you need to fully detail your 
ship using the form the Coordinator has developed.  

Some of you don\'t seem to want to develop an ISBA 
member company and that\'s okay too.  If you just 
want to design ships under your own name, you can 
do that.  The Coordinator doesn\'t mind.  However; 
you need a distinctive Key-code so as to not confuse 
the robots, which are of rather limited intelligence 
(and no cracks about them taking after their 
developer :-).

If you would like to enter a design and do not yet have 
a Key-code, you can just send the coordinator 
<thuddd@netzero.net> a request for a key code with 
or without a description of your ISBA design firm.  
Then the coordinator will assign a Key-code and 
make a note of it in the Key-code registry.  If you 
have several design firms with different design 
philosophies, you may have several different 
Key-codes (one for each design firm).

What kind of things should you put in the "Description" 
of your "Firm?"  Well, your description can contain 
anything that you feel would be interesting to visitors 
to the ISBA or THUDDD web sites.  It might include 
any of the following:
History
Ownership
Design Philosophy
Marketing Philosophy
Corporate Structure
Corporate Politics
Primary Product Line(s)
Secondary Product Line(s)
Tertiary Product Line(s)
Rumors
Statements
Anything else that you think will make your company 
"come alive" for the readers.  (BTW, if you can think 
of any other headers for stuff, send them to the 
Coordinator <thuddd@netzero.net> and they will be 
included in the web page that covers this topic.)

If you don\'t feel like you are a good enough writer to 
come up with a decent layout for your company, then 
let the Coordinator know and the Coordinator will try 
to help.  You could for example send the Coordinator 
an email that contains your ramblings about the 
design firm and the Coordinator will coordinate 
editing what you send to the Coordinator and send it 
back to you for your approval.  When you get it back, 
you might think of some other stuff that could be 
added and the Coordinator will see to it that it gets 
added.  When you are happy with what you have, 
then the Coordinator will post it to the web site.  What 
could be easier?

If you have some talent as a copywriter and can spare 
some time to help edit things like this, it would help 
your Coordinator <thuddd@netzero.net>, so your 
Coordinator wants to know about that too.

Your THUDDD Coordinator is sure that some of you 
are wondering why your THUDDD Coordinator keeps 
referring to himself by title rather than by name.   Your 
Coordinator is trying to make a THUDDD that can be 
easily taken over by just about anyone for the day 
when your Coordinator doesn\'t have the time to spare 
to do the job properly.

When the next Coordinator takes over, they will have 
web space, an email address, robots, etc. all ready to 
go and all they will have to do is to handle the 
administration of the THUDDDs.  No, your 
Coordinator is not going anywhere anytime soon; 
however, since this is a part-time voluntary position, 
I know eventually, I\'ll want to move on.  By the way, 
this day could be delayed if there were a way for 
THUDDD to make a profit for me.  I\'m looking into 
some stuff that can be added on the side and would 
appreciate it if you would consider helping me by 
checking the THUDDD/special_services before 
spending any online money elsewhere.

If anyone has any objections to my doing this, speak 
up now!  If anyone has any ideas as to how I could 
make money using some of the extra web space at 
the THUDDD site, I would like to hear from you as 
well.

That\'s it for now, except to mention that the online 
submission form should be up after this week-end.
Please read and follow the instructions carefully.
Try these two URLs to see if it has been posted:

Hey, don\'t get mad at me, I told you it would be up

Actually there are studies about distribution of intelligence and performance 
in the US Army. If I remember them correctly intelligent soldiers improved 
infantry performance - but the number of intelligent men in the infantry had 
declined from WWII to Korea.
After all any dummy can be sent to the front, but it takes some brainsto

Einsteins. Luckily these are being  replaced by autoloaders.

Amen.

Damn. This really sucks.

His creativity provided many, many hours of happiness in the lives of
people across the world (including mine). Very few people can say that.

Hm.I think you\'re overestimating the difficulty of the tasks. In
MegaTraveller, skill level 3+ is professional, with a further 1-2 bonus for
stat. This means that a "professional" would have at least +4 on all tasks;
an "expert" would have a skill level of 5+, and very possibly a high enough
stat to get +2, so an "expert" would get about +6 or +7.  All of these on a
2d roll, of course.

A "Routine" task succeeds on 7+. A professional would need only 3+ (on 2d)
to succeed - the best odds they could get anyway (as 2 is automatic
failure). A "Difficult" task requires 11+, so for a professional that\'s
about 7+, and for an expert that\'s about 4+ or 5+.

You also had the option of doing a task "cautiously", which made the task a
level easier (assuming that you first passed a determination roll). In my
group, most people did Formidable tasks this way, and often the Difficult
ones as well.

Anyway, back to GT. If an expert has a skill level of 16+, what about a
professional? (Ie. what is the difference between a competent doctor and a
world-famous one?)

Ah, I\'d disagree with this.

An "Impossible" task should be just that, very nearly impossible. In MT
terms it meant rolling 19+ on 2d, so even with an expert skill level (4-5)
and lots of stat (10+ giving a +2 dm) you\'d still have to roll 11+ or 12+
to succeed. The solution, of course, was to use things like cautious task
rolls to reduce the task from "Impossible" to "Formidable".

I haven\'t run the numbers yet, but the BITS spread (+/- 3 steps) looks
pretty reasonable to me.

As to skill levels, would this be a reasonable description of GURPS skill
levels?

Amateur or beginner (11-)
Journeyman (12-14)
Professional (15-16)
Expert (17-18)
World-renowned expert (19+)

With 1 days limited life support? You\'re braver than you look :) 

With 0.656G acceleration, Earths 100D and back is a 16 hours round trip, plus
another hour for reaching orbit and landing, plus whatever time you spend at the
100D. Not much safety margin.

Personally I would want full life support if at any point I am exceeding escape
velocity.

Which trojan points? Not that many planets have nearby trojan/lagrange points,
and gas giant trojans are way out. 

You also only have a 100,000 mile communicator, cramped seats and no bunks or
toilets. I wouldn\'t want to go that far in it. Perhaps it could be a mustering
out benefit for an x-boat pilot ;-)

Hee, yes I\'ll fix it when I made some other addition/corrections
this afternoon.  When I was putting the info up, I gave up trying to
be completely consistant and mostly just did cut and paste.  I was
sure I\'d hear from people about whatever I got wrong.  Of course,
once I do I\'ll start hearing from our Canadian friends...<g>

>traffic and action DAILY on each.  

Yes, that\'s true.  There are different styles of play and different
types of games called PBEM.

With only an occasional slow day, my AKUS PBEM averages close to a
dozen posts a day.  Carlos and Keven\'s games are as active.  The
thing that these three games have in common, other than good
players, great GMs (not including myself, of course), and very
interactive plots is that they focus on *roleplaying*.
Additionally, there are no set turns and the posts go directly to
the players without constant moderation (we GMs *do* step in to
maintain flow from time to time), this keeps the games flowing and
*hopefully* keeps the player\'s interest high.  The downside is that
the play is somewhat chaotic and players can get lost in the plot,
it\'s sometimes hard for slow posters to effectivly contribute, and
there is continious pressure on the GM because he isn\'t having
sessions once a week, he\'s running sessions *every* day.

Another style has all players react to a "turn" sent out by the GM
within a set timeframe.  The GM collects these posts, puts them
together, determines what happened and posts the results of that
turn, followed by the next turn.  I\'ve been in this style game in
the past and it can work well if the time between turns isn\'t too
long and the GM is very good at creating compelling narratives in
his results and turn posts.  OTOH, in many cases, the players are
pretty isolatied from one another with the GM being a buffer
(sometimes a barrier) or the time between posts gets so long that
games can bog down and fade out as players lose interest.

You can mix these two styles, too.  For example, I sometimes give my
AKUS people a "turn" where they tell me what they are doing for an
entire day (or week) and we handle that entire period with a
consolidating post.  On the other side, a "turn" based game may slip
into "interactive" mode (or go to IRC) for the big showdown scenes
where the action will be fast and furious.

Games that don\'t emphasise roleplaying, TCS/FFW type games, work
better with a "turn" based system.  Have firm deadlines and
procedures if a player doesn\'t make a deadline.  Don\'t make the
turns too far apart, I\'d really try for no less than one a week,
say...Result/New Turn goes out from the GM on Sunday and and replies
must be back to the GM by 6am Saturday morning.  That gives the GM
two days to evaluate replies, figure results and get the Results and
New Turn post off, and it gives the players five days to make their
next turn.

These figures are OTTOMH not published that I\'m aware of but how about
Pop multiples of 9 for New Home, 1 for Esperanza, and 3 for all the other
majors this gives a consistent 3.33 ratio between the populations.

I know you are correct about what *happens*, but I don\'t think you
are right if you think that *should* happen.  If you look at the
numbers...and the guidelines in Basic...you see that 16 for IQ is
considered *genius* and expert level for skills.  Don\'t throw the
weapons levels at me either, those are appropriate for a heroic
fantasy games, but, IMO, not for Traveller.  I\'m going to throw one
of the GURPSite\'s favorite terms at you, <g> "balance", skill levels
of 20, or even routinely in the upper teens, are unbalancing for the
*Traveller* universe (at least in MTU they would be).

IMO, Traveller PC\'s are only "a cut above average", *not* supermen.
They are heroes because of *what* they do, not because of their high
Stats or Skills.  Their Stats should range from 8 to 14, and that 14
is after all advancement.  Their *best* one or two skills should be
15 to 17, their average professional skills should be 12 to 14, and
their other skills should vary from 8 to 12.  Very, very rarely
should you see an 18+ for any skill, and then only in some narrow
specialty and only if the PC has disadvantaged himself in other
areas.  As for advancement, that should be *very* slow once past 15,
taking *years and years* of experience, and should be mostly offset
by aging penalties.

<snip>

I agree., aybe the *very* best skill of a *very* rare PC, but we\'re
talking about a one in ten thousand case.  Impossible *should* be
virtually impossible...and Hopeless shouldn\'t be much easier. <g>

>I haven\'t run the numbers yet, but the BITS spread (+/- 3 steps)
>looks pretty reasonable to me.

Rob, I did and they are pretty reasonable *if* skills don\'t inflate
beyond the ranges I listed above.  If skills start getting routinely
into the upper teens and twenties then virtually Impossible tasks
begin to get too easy.

>As to skill levels, would this be a reasonable description of GURPS

Personally, I\'d drop the scale just a little...

>Amateur or beginner (11-)       (10-)
>Journeyman (12-14)              (11-13)

>World-renowned expert (19+)     (17)

Marvel was skill based, not task based... the labels defined skill levels,
not difficulties. So hard tasks were shifted x collums towards feeble, and
easy towars shift x/ShiftZ (Marvel, Adv MarveL).

The fundamental difference between skill based systems and task based
systems is
Item		Skill Based		Task Based
Target number	Skill level		task difficulty
Mods apply to	Skill level		task roll*

Or, should I say, most task systems adjust the roll, rather than the TN
(BP, StarPlay, several others). A few use variable numbers of dice for
difficulties...and really are hybrids.

In a skill based system, each skill has a target number of it\'s own, and
you modify the target number to find the actual target number for the
action. Examples D&D/AD&D, Palladium, Chaosium (Both BRP asnd Pendragon
Engines), STRPG (by FASA).

Most task systems have set target numbers by difficulty, which you need to
meet or beat to succeed, including MT, StarPlay, BabProj, Star Wars,
WoD/StoryTeller, LUGTrek, CP2020, Mekton/MZ, Rolemaster/Spacemaster

Some hybrids use a skill target number with difficulty level variables:
TNE, T2K 1s & 2d eds, James Bond RPG,  and IIRC, Mythus.

I\'m happy to go along with this if all the players who expressed an interest
(you know who you are are) are content.  Steven Hudson has been kind enough
to forward me some comments and rules from the TCS game that Donald McKinney
is running (thanks Steven), which I am perusing at the moment. Donald\'s
ruling was 8, 2, 5 for the pop multipliers (TCS is pre extended UWP\'s), but
I think I prefer your suggestion.

Heh! These are the same choices I made in an abortive FTF TCS game that
never actually got started, nigh on 15 years ago.  Esperanza is rich but
hampered by lower tech, New Home (relatively) poor but with bleeding edge
technology... Ooooh! Desicions, desicions <g>.

Your preferences are duly noted (as is Mark\'s).  As there are currently only
six interested parties (and one who would like to \'Lurk\') the chances are
good that poeple will get their first choice.
I emailed the various parties involved with their \'precedence\' number, so if
the others would like to send me an email with their preference for faction
(in order of preference in case of ties), I\'ll work out who gets to be
which, and let you all know your starting budgets.

Please note that ALL designs must be approved by ICSSSI, the Island Cluster
Starship Standards and Safety Inspectorate (ie Me!). Also note that only Bk5
High Guard 2nd edition designs are allowed (no Bk2 Starships shenanigans...
J-6 at TL9, my ar*e!).

I will also be toning down the money from a Cr500 per capita Naval tax to
something nearer Cr100.  The rest gets spent on training, shore
installations, provisions, pay, pensions, naval bases etc, and thus on 20%
or so is available for actual construction and maintenance of vessels.  As I
said earlier, I\'ll let players know their exact available budgets soon.

Actually, studies done in the eighties showed that the more intelligent
recruits were more likely to go combat arms.  The studies concluded that
these recruits were look for adventure rather than college money and job
skills.  I can honestly say that I met some very sharp people as a grunt,
and only a limited number of dimbulbs.

And who calls in that artillery, has to be able to discern between over
fifty different types of armored vehicles (and know how to kill half of
them with two different weapons systems?), be able to generate usable
intelligence reports, and do all of this while people are trying *real
hard* to kill you?  The infantry.

These days of the dumb grunt with a rifle died during WWII.  Today,
infantry is as much a mental challenge as a physical one.

All this ignores the fact that most armies spend their time in internal
security/repression style activities, where gadgets are _relatively_
secondary, and PBIs with rifles are relatively important.  And that\'s only
considering the armies of recognised states.  Their opponents are usually
more or less guerillas, or distinctly undertrained militias.

The small professional armies are only those of a minority of countries. 
Somalia and Vietnam suggest that they aren\'t necessarily all that superior
either, when it comes to a clash, at least in terms of actually achieving
the political goals of the conflict.

OBTRAV:  The Rebellion sourcebook had a brief mention of "popular forces"
being involved in the Rebellion, but there wasn\'t much else on it.  Apart
from that, Broadsword had some sketchy details on the Tanoose Freedom
League guerillas.

An interesting Mercenary style game would be for the players to be cadres
for popular forces fighting against a regular/mercenary force.  The players
would then be the ones lurking in the piranha-leech infested swamps, while
the Astroburger Legion hunt them from the comfort of airconditioned
g-carriers.  Fun fun fun!

Yes, of course it is, but I remember someone on the list having a
brainspasm about it, and I was letting people like this deal with their own
problems.  

Basically, this was a passing comment of no consequence.

have no better prospects and aren\'t really suitable for the military either.

These days most American kids who *can* go to college would rather do so,
or seek other means of financial aid, rather than take their chances with
the hardships of military life and the possibility of getting shot at.

In yet another example of the kind of thinking that makes "mil-intel" an
oxymoron, the response of the armed forces has been to raise quotas for the
already stressed-out and dispirited recruiters...

All planets will have Trojan points. Planets with significantly massive
moons will have lagrange points. Lagrange points will be in the same orbit
(or close enough to for practical purposes) as the moon.

Trojan points will be well beyond the 100d point, tho...

        Agree with you on everything except the first count, Doug.  In
better than six years as a FiST Leader and Battalion FSO frequently
directly attached to an infantry battalion even in cantonment, I never
got anyone below the rank of E-6 (and damn few of them) to take
calling for fire seriously.  Except for scouts, everybody figured that
calling in artillery or mortars was the job of the platoon leader,
platoon sgt., or FO, and me and my FOs were still artillery, even if
we were the "bastard children" of artillery and infantry in the field.

        The US Army of Vietnam was NOT a "small professional army".
It was a conscription-formed, professionally-led army, IMO a poor combo.
OTOH, if you were referring to French forces in Vietnam, I\'ll give you that.
And Somalia, IMO, was a political screw-up, not a military one.
        As far as your point of small professional armies not doing well
against popular civilian risings, two counter-examples are the Moro
rebellion in the Phillipines and the Boer War.
        ObTrav: IMTU, suppression of civilian dis-order, counter-terrorism,
etc. would be primarily an Imperial Army job.  The Marines, as an elite
force, would train only rarely, if at all, for this mission, while the Army
would probably even have units specially trained for it.

I disagree. The Marines are the Imperium\'s rapid reaction force. They are
the troops you send into those spots with civil disorder hoping it doesn\'t
evolve into terrorism and rebellion. IMHO the biggest difference between
the Marines and Army is in staying power. The Marines can hit really
hard, but they are a one shot weapon. If you want staying power, you send
in the Emperors Dog Soldiers (the Army).

Let me start off by trying to cover my flame-sensitive ass by positioning
myself as a neutral party:  I do not, nor am planning to use either GURPS or
MT as my system of choice.  They are equally fine, as far as I am concerned.
(I am such a weasel!  : P  )

In fact, I believe everyone involved has declared a truce, that no slams are
intended towards anyone\'s favorite system, and this is just a friendly
discussion among enthusiasts.  I think everyone agrees that there is a
certain amount of style and personal preference here - it just comes down to
what you and your players are the most comfortable with.  What then are we
arguing about, er, discussing?  Well, William\'s post suggests an interesting
classification system for RPG mechanics, intended to highlight a basis for
preference.  It did help me understand the \'skill vs. task system\' school of
thought a little better.  I do have some questions about it though - like
most classification schemes, it requires some validity-sapping assumptions
(IMO).

I\'m going to put on my TotalGeek (tm) propeller beanie, and approach this
from another angle entirely.  A professional predilection of mine is to
break complex problems into hierarchical layers.  Fundamentally, a RPG
ruleset\'s purpose is to model a simulation of an imaginary \'game reality\'
via some kind of probablity mechanism (i.e., dice, cards, coin-flip,
pop-a-matic..  : ).  So in my scheme, we have a \'Probability Layer\', which
defines the actual probability model.  This is the concrete layer where the
rubber meets the road - dice are rolled, the dice are compared to a target
number, and conclusions are drawn from the result.  Above this is the
\'Simulation Layer\', where the imaginary game world is modeled.  This is an
abstract layer, which maps the imaginary to the concrete.  The Probablity
Layer defines low-level mechanics or tools which are in turn used by the
Simulation Layer to deliver high-level game play.  Something more than just
craps or roulette.

With this in mind:

Ok, now we\'re cooking with gas.  I read this as making a distinction between
systems that modify the target number vs. modifying the die roll.  Some of
us have a real problem with this line of thinking, because at the
Probability Layer, there is absolutely no difference between +2 target
and -2 die roll.  They are the same, as far as probability is concerned.
This is where the \'its just semantics\' argument comes from.  I think there
is an argument that there *is* a difference at the Simulation Layer, because
a different system of bookkeeping can have implications for what really
\'works\' in the imaginary world.  This is where the \'its just a different
style of modifiers\' idea springs.

Regarding "hybrids" - this is, IMHO, a hole in the \'task system\'
classification scheme.  My above paragraph assumes a \'conventional\' RPG
system, where all probablity is modeled as target number or die roll
modifiers.  In this regard, GURPS and MT are no different from each other -
in the Probability Layer, they both ultimately produce a simple linear
displacement on the probability curve.  Most games work this way, but as you
point out, some games have other probability \'levers\' that they can pull.
In the case of Shadowrun (disclaimer: this is *my* system of choice  : ),
skill is modeled by differing numbers of dice and difficulty is modeled
conventionally by target number.  Let\'s clarify that for anyone not familiar
with SR: each skill die is rolled against the same target number
independently of each other.  The result is a number of successes (the count
of dice that matched or exceeded the target number), which are used to
determine the level or quality of success.  So a \'task\' in Shadowrun might
be expressed as Electronics (4) - if I have a skill rating of Electronics 3,
then I roll three d6s individually against a target number of 4, resulting
in zero to three possible successes.   This mechanism provides an entirely
new dimension that fundamentally impacts both the simulation and probability
rules.

I was really hung up on this "each skill has a target number of it\'s own"
bit, which I believe has popped up previously in this thread.  While I can
see a game that has all the success rules listed individually for each
skill, I don\'t think this what you meant.  In MT, the first task
specification is difficulty (target number), the second is a list of
applicable skills and/or characteristics (modifiers).  In other systems, the
task or \'success test\' (to borrow the SR term for it) is expressed the other
way around - skill/characteristic (modifier) is listed first, followed by
the difficulty rating (target number).  This is your "each skill has a
target number of it\'s own" idea, right?  My SR skill example, above, does
exactly that.  In MT, conversely, each target number has its own skill.
<heh-heh>

Personally, I think this is kind of like like arguing front-wheel drive vs.
rear-wheel drive - the trade-offs go both ways.  : )  I once saw a print ad
for an early 20th century FWD car that featured a picture of the proverbial
cart-before-the-horse.  Perhaps that\'s where some of heat in these arguments
are coming from.  ; )

Hmm.  I wonder at some of these picks.  In my thinking, there is more to a
\'task-based\' system than predefined target numbers for standardized
difficulty levels.  At the Probablility Layer, there is no difference
between difficulty as a target number or difficulty as a modifier - it all
comes out in the wash.  So there needs to be something else at the
Simulation Layer that distinguishes these games from \'skill-based\' ones.
AFAIK, MegaTraveller is pretty unique in this regard.  More on this below.

> Some hybrids use a skill target number with difficulty level variables:

Ok, Shadowrun uses the standard \'skill-based\' expression for static,
unopposed tests that are typical for skills like Electronics or Vacc-suit.
For combat, however, things are defined more like your \'task-based\' form of
expression.  For example, in SR ranged combat the base target number is
derived from the range to target, i.e. Short = 4, Medium = 5, Long = 6, and
Extreme = 9.  This is more-or-less like MT\'s difficulty ratings, which are
also used to model range effects, IIRC.  On the third hand, however, are
opposed tests (\'confrontation\' tasks in MT parlance).  In SR melee combat,
both combatants roll against a base of 4, modified by weapon reach and other
melee modifiers.  The character with the most success wins that round - the
loser takes damage.  There is no \'difficulty\' level, per se.  So does all
this make Shadowrun a hybrid system?  Does the question even make sense to
ask?  <not mocking anyone here - just being pendantic>

My take on \'task vs. skill\' (yes, I\'m almost done.., really!):

- - Style.  Eris\'s names-over-numbers, and William\'s difficulty-before-skill.

- - Function.  Functionally, at the Probablity Layer, there is no distinction
between \'task\' and \'skill\' systems.  At the Simulation Layer, the
functionality comes down to skill/characteristic/attribute selection, and
the substitution or defaulting of the same.  MT says, here is a task and
here are the skills, etc, you can choose from to determine success.  If
there is more than one \'crucial\' specification, then some kind of skill or
characteristic substitution is available for that task.  Games like GURPS or
Shadowrun define the task as a skill - the task and the means of success are
directly bound together.  However, there is no other means of success listed
because these games already have an entire system of defaulting defined.  MT
encapsulates its defaulting scheme on a task-by task basis, whereas other
games break this out into a separate sub-system.  Both ways get the job
done, IMO.  <shrug>

When MegaTraveller first came out, my first impression of the task system
was "hey, cool - if I had a cardfile of tasks already" and "but thats a lot
of work, and just plain anal, besides".  In other words, profoundly
ambivalent.  : P

Man!  I sure hope I got THAT all out of my system.  Sorry to bore y\'all to
tears with that \'get-a-life\' game analysis.  I hope it was worth somebody\'s
bandwidth...    I\'m waay past my bedtime!  : P

Hmm. That must have been in one of the jumpdrive "debates".

I was just extending your reference list ;-) I can\'t actually remember what

Probably something to do with technobabble...

GTL9 Reactionless Thrusters (as has been said before) give very low performance.
Typically 0.5G when in a fully equipped space craft.

Preliminary results for the fusion rocket suggest you could build a moderately
armoured(500DR) GTL9 400DT SDB capable of 3G for 100 minutes (5 combat turns) or
2G for 160 minutes (7 combat turns). A lightly armoured craft (100DR) could
maintain 4G for two hours. Not very long. So you probably want to put a couple
of reactionless thrusters in there for backup too.

I guess it comes down to whether you want high performance for a couple of
hours, or low performance forever. However reactionless thrusters are very
expensive. The military and merchant craft at this TL are going to be much more
distinct in their performance.

True, but I had several leaders who enjoyed walking up to you during FXs
and saying "I\'m dead, you\'re in charge now."  No matter what your rank, you
had to take over the leadership responsibilities.  Very good training, and
it kept you awake during FRAGOs.

The Sylean Rangers get that role in the ground forces book.  The do
everything from long term recon/sabotage/cadre work on enemy held worlds to
anti-terrorist teams ala SEAL 6 or the FBI\'s HRT.  The preliminary template
for them is getting scary.

The larger Army units do spend a great amount of their time sitting between
hostile forces, or doing large scale counter-insurgency work.  The Marines
are more like the fire brigade, sent in *quickly* to knock down an
immediate threat.

An interesting point to ponder.. The various subsector Armies are under the
loose control of the Subsector Duke, who appoints the Subsector Marshal.
The Marines are the Emperor\'s troops, and under orders from the Fleet.  You
could get a situation where a Duke doesn\'t want to intervene in a crisis,
and the local Marine commander is forced to do the Army\'s job while an
appeal races off to the Archduke.

Gee, I hope you *didn\'t* get that out of your system. I found it to be very

There are already 10,000,000,000 neutrinos from the sun passing through
every cm2 of your body every second.  IIRC you need about 4,500 light
years of lead to shield from neutrinos.

Actually, with the Contragrav, you can use 1.65 G for the

I suspect there is some kind of toilet facilities included in the limited

a Camper.

Definitions proposal:

Let\'s see here... the idea of defining actions in mechanics (Can we use
action as a neutral term?"

You have to define how to resolve an action in game mechanics.
It really helps to use a consistant system throughout a game\'s mechanics.

The task systems in general define a target number to be hit by the task
difficulty, and how to generate this target number.

Skill based systems are those systems where a base target number is
assigned to individual skills, and modified for circumstances and
difficulty.

Hybrid task systems use individual targets by skill, but with consistant
modifier sets for a given difficulty level.

and, just for completeness: There are attribute based systems (T&T, D&D).
There are systems without a single system, and some without any system for
skills or their useage.

<end of proposal>

Looking at this, CT had a (table driven) task-style approach for combat,
and no defined action resolution system overall.
MT has a task system.
TNE has a hybrid system. Many players wind up writing out 5 TN\'s per skill...
T4 has a hybrid system. difficulty is dice thrown vs a static TN by skill.
GURPS is very clearly based upon the skill based approach.

At the probability layer, T4 is the one where difficulty reall does change
probability curves in ways that skill levels do not. (Not that I like
t4/t4.1).

CT has several competing systems for resolving actions:
	The combat 8+ on 2d+ mods + skill
	Roll (Att+Skill) or less on 2d
	Roll 2d+att for any given GM determined TN.
	roll 2d+skill for Ref Determined TN or greater.
	the DGP/MT task system.
	The 3 difficulty AHL/Striker Roll 2d+skill vs 8+/10+/12+
	a ziilliion homegrown variations and elaborations on the above
	the really different methods... like grafting Star Wars style TN\'s
to rolling skill+ Att/2 dice, etc....

It\'s based on 1 AU. In reality, you can\'t make measurements precisely 2 AU
apart except for stars near one pole or the the other; most stars can only be
easily observed for 4-5 months or so (the time that they\'re well up during the
night.) In practice, even for circumpolar stars, you\'ll never be able to
observe
them precisely six months apart. So you end up working out how many AUs
the Earth really has moved...and having done that, the math is much easier
if you can then just go "distance-to-star = parallax * distance earth moved".

(It also means that if you observe a distant system, 1 second of arc of
angle is a number of AUs equal to the distance of that system in parsecs,
which is handy.)

I\'d rather say names-before-numbers.  

You *can* do task resolution with *almost* no regard to numbers at
all.  With FUDGE, for example, you can run your finger up or down a
simple table determining the number needed on a 4df roll.  

OTOH, I find it easier to use numbers, I just don\'t want the
*players* thinking in numeric terms.  I couldn\'t do that if I didn\'t
roll almost all the dice, but I do. <g>

Let\'s *not* get into a long debate on this again, okay? But...

...IMTU, you can\'t jump to empty hexes (you may call that deepspace
jumps if you wish), and anything I ever say about this subject
refers to *My* Traveller universe.

My real reason isn\'t technobabble, that\'s just the justification for
my reasons.  <g> For strategic and economic reasons, I want the
ships to have to follow the star patterns, in particular J1 and J2
mains.  

Forcing ships to jump from occupied hex to occupied hex (system to
system) enhances the feel *I* want IMTU.  I could go into why this
is so, if anyone was interested, but knowing the history of these
discussions probably shouldn\'t do it on the list.

Finally, IIRC, the only people that had "brainspasms" were those
that couldn\'t handle that someone might be doing something different
from them. I\'m *all* for letting "people like this deal with their own
problems."

Just because it is illegal, does not mean you cant do it. :-)

There will be people willing to do stunts like this, my point is that you have
to be insane or over confifdent you can escape the consequences of the actions.
In my example, I had the scouts pull together a scratch force to assult the
suspected potential near c rocks. The reason I did this was to show how serious
the Imperium is to enforce the ban. The liberal use of nuclear weapons should
also be a subtle hint.

The accords is an attemt to answer the reason than Near C rocks are not
mentioned in cannon.The accords is also a fantastic hook for adventurers, the
Imperium detects a possable PBS , but has no forces nearby, and drafts the
players. Or the player are the people setting up a PBS, and have to play a
double jepody between their employers and the Imperium.

>I am right in thinking that breastfeeding acts as an (effective?)
>contraceptive aren\'t I?

Just mentioned this thread to my wife, who pointed out that "breastfeeding
is a 99% effective contraceptive" is a few percentage points off. Even tube
tying is only rated as 97% effective. She pointed out that two of the
ladies in our church are breastfeeding AND pregnant. One has a 10-month-old
and is 5 months pregnant, one has a 12-month-old and is 4 months pregnant
(oh, and had previously tried for 3 YEARS to have a baby). My wife\'s sister
managed to get pregnant while breastfeeding AND on the "little" Pill (her
two previous pregnancies were also while on the Pill - she seems to take it
to _get_ pregnant!  ;-). After that last baby, she had her tubes tied, and
was told the odds. Her comment was along the lines of, "Oh great! With my
odds I\'ll be pregnant within the month!"

Most of these contraceptive methods are dependant on how well your body
reacts with them (they work well for some and not others).

So, the line about breastfeeding is not as untrue as all those lies about
"you can\'t get pregnant the first time" or "you can\'t get pregnant if you
have sex standing up" or  "in the shower", but still NOT TRUE.

Sounds like one of those old jokes: "Q: What do you call a woman who had
sex while breastfeeding? A: A new mother."  ;-)

There is a huge debate raging over C-section rates. Rates went way
up in the 80\'s (some hospitals delivered over 30% or more of all
births via C-section). People accuse doctors of everything from
being lazy (C-sections are a hell of a lot more predictable than
vaginal births, makijgn it easier to get to that 3 PM tee-time) to
trying to extract extra money from patients.

The current (in most of the US) trend is towards, believe it or not,
a 15% C-section rate. Yes, they pulled the number out of thin air.
Now many women are being hurt and babies are dying as a result of
doctors who are being ordered by hospitals not to perform C-sections
except under the most extreme of circumstances. Luckily saner heads
are beginning to prevail and more people are calling for C-sections
to be administered based on medical necessity and not because of
this month\'s "quota".

Slim hips are the least of a woman\'s worries when it comes to
C-sections. It\'s only slightly less politically charged than
abortion.

The chronic malnourishment that it takes to make someone look like
Kate Moss prevents most women from ovulating/menstruating, much less
becoming pregnant. I used to have a (female) roommate who stopped
menstruating in her teens due to excessively low body fat (due to
genetics more than anything else). When she made a conscious effort
to gain fat (on medical advice) her period re-started. Apparently
some of the key female sex hormones are fat soluble, making them
hard to regulate without a certain level of body fat.

That being said, it takes no more body fat than an average woman has
to support a healthy pregnancy. As a matter of fact, I would guess
that most below-average women in terms of body fat (and maybe even
muscle) can sustain a pregnancy just fine. It\'s more a question of
caloric & nutritional intake during the pregnancy than what you have
going in. I can relate a number of anecdotal examples of women with
normal-to-low body-mass-ratios who gained little weight, had healthy
babies and then proceeded to lose any weight they did gain. It\'s not
something I\'d suggest, but a woman doesn\'t have to look like she
stepped out of a Rubens painting to have a healthy pregnancy.
Ongoing good nutrition is the key.

On another note, with regards to previous comments about breast
feeding serving as birth control, I don\'t think anyone would claim
it\'s 100%, even for exclusively breast-fed babies. Breast feeding
does release large amount of a hormone (oxytocin?) that inhibits
ovulation, but it varies from woman to woman. It\'s rely more of an
evolutionary mechanism to prevent women from killing themselves by
having to support feeding 2 or 3 children simultaneously (1 or 2 on
the breast and one in the womb). Breast feding as birth control is
about as effective as the rhythm method - that is, properly done,
quite good, but always less than 100%.

ObAside: Ever wonder how things like condoms and spermicide get less
than 100% efficiency ratings? User error. Apparently people _say_
they used condoms when, a small number of times, they just plain ol\'
forgot to "wrap the meat". The same goes with the rhythm method.
Anyone who has tried to conceive knows that it\'s a damn lot harder
than all those teenage mothers would have you believe. The average
woman, taking into account the 3-5 day lifespan of sperm, is fertile
about 3 or 4 days a month. Of course, the problem is _which 3 days_!

Anyway, I\'m no medical expert, but I did learn a lot the subject
about 23-some months ago, leading up to the
conception/birth/upbringing of our 14-month old boy. Man, is he
cute. ;)

I took a short journey today to visit Jay LaRosee at his

I admired the restored icon of our cult (i mean obsession,

mounted in the gaming area of his shop.

He\'s got a really nice setup and well worth a visit. Also a
few really nice vintage trav items to sell as well. But enough
of the infomercial. In the course of our chat, we talked over the
last few flame wars and the one that bobbed to the surface like a
3 day old apple was the Traveller Version.

We both came to the conclusion that the best traveller version is the
one that people will play. Period.

My group in St. Louis plays a complied version of CT, Mega-Traveller,
House-rules and a smattering a various other specific rules cadged from
other games that we\'ve all liked. IMHO almost any traveller rules will work,
if not well, then sufficently provided the GM is capable and relatively
evenhanded.

I proposed that it is more fruitfull to devote time and flames to devising

the many milleux that seem to pop up crazy.

Well, since mentioning it to my missus (whom I mentioned was in childcare),
this is now the "hot topic" over lunch with her staff... Seems there are
many such mothers breastfeeding and preggers.  The other staff obviously are
in childcare also, and they to have a lot of contact with a wide spread of
mothers over SE Queensland and near every centre they worked in has had at
least one such mother.

On the pill subject, 3-of-the-4 children we have were conceived while treas
on the pill... as was the one we lost (early miscarriage).  As for tube
tying, even a bloke having a vasectomy still has a 3-4% chance of it not
taking.  Nature is against contraception it seems.

Hee!  I suspect you might get some argument that the point of RPGs
is for the *GM* to "tell a story."  Whether I agree or not, I\'m not
going to argue with you about it, just mention that there is a
*long* standing debate between dramatists vs simulationists.  And
IMO, each side is right for their own games.

Fair enough, but you know what they say about opinions?

Ahem. I guess I will expose my own...

Opinion, that is. ;)

The only problem is that your opinion is only applicable for extensively
plotted, well-structured games. While extremely cinematic games are
interesting and fun, a really loosely run cinematic campaign *without* a
strong plot is one of the most annoying things to be involved with as a
player.  There are those out there -- especially in the Traveller
community -- who like games that aren\'t heavily scripted, they like to let
the cards fall where they may.

While I agree with you for the most part, I must say that there\'s a real
danger in taking the cinematic sentiment too far. Roleplaying games are a
simulation of reality... the consensus reality of a GM and his players. That
is a really important distinction to make.

Different systems allow varying amounts of "reality" to creep into the
flavor and feel of the game. Having played both MegaTraveller and GURPS I\'ve
got to say that, effectively, one is just as "realistic" as the other (the
only difference is that the GURPS framework can be used in extremely
cinematic games and extremely realistic ones).

I tend to be suspicious of those who preach that rules should be realistic
and those who preach that rules should be cinematic... both sides usually
come off sounding like they\'ve found the Holy Grail, the one true method of
playing.

Unfortunately, neither side is "right", because it\'s not an issue of right
and wrong.

There is no flame war going on! Even using a loose definition there\'s been
no real flame war going on. People will differ in opinions, but the
"Traveller Versions" debate isn\'t even lukewarm (and in my personal opinion
it doesn\'t look like it\'s really going to heat up very much).

One of the few problems with the Traveller mailing list is that certain
discussions achieve flame war "status" without ever having really heated up.
Usually, the real problem is that two sides tend to go on about an issue for
a long time, and there are folks who get sick of hearing about it (the
piracy debate never really got hot, but it lasted for weeks on end).

That\'s where you\'re wrong! The best Traveller version is the one I play.

That\'s the real problem, isn\'t it? GMs are in such short supply that one

Well, keep in mind that a few task systems that can be grafted on to GURPS
have come out of the discussion, and more than a few mistaken assumptions
have been cleared up. It\'s not like the debate has been completely useless.
I have to say that I\'ve found it rather interesting so far.

This happens every once in awhile, an issue comes up and is discussed at
length which is Traveller related but that doesn\'t really interest everybody
on the list. A few people that aren\'t interested will try to sweep the
discussion under the carpet. Everyone\'s entitled to their opinion, but keep
do keep in mind that some people are actually interested in the mechanics of
the various systems that Traveller has used.

What was the prevailing tech back then?  TL12, TL13?  At TL13, they\'d have 
J4, which would help, but lack decent maps of the space they\'d need to go 
through, which would hinder.  Gripping hand says, they\'d take the easy way 
out and go through Corridor.

The big problem would be the lack of accurate charts of the Rift.  There are 
places you could go that would let you pack fuel in for other ships and 
resupply your caches from 2 parsecs away.  True \'flying gascan\' scenario, but 
do-able at a high enough tech level.

He\'d have the advantages of a higher baseline technology (TL15/16 in the 
TNE), accurate charts of the Rift, and the knowledge that it *could* be done.

I don\'t think so.  In fact, it *would* be doable, as well as being totally

Only if he goes through Corridor.  Hell, the *Aslans* have a J5 route across 
the Rift into the Spinward Marches; the guys doing that Imperium-wide tour 
took it on their way home.

  Thanks Pat for the comments on Medieval Starship; I do enjoy showing off 
the store to fellow Travellers.
   My .02cr on Traveller Versions; I don\'t care what you play- just play and 
promote it to others. For me, I like having a strong, consistant history and 
background in which to play. When I talk to others, its nice when we all have 
the same understanding and common knowledge of the different timeframes. 
Which one is best depends only (IMHO) on what type of adventure campaign 
suits your group\'s interest; exploring, commerce, political intrique, 
whatever.
   Rule sets don\'t matter to me; if they address the "known physics" of the 
game, I don\'t care how you get from point A to B. House rules just reflect an 
adjustment by the GM to the quirks and left turns of imaginative players. So 
long as the GM is consistant, I can play and enjoy his campaign.
   Now my rant:
   What I don\'t like is our contentment to just seek out and game with other 
legacy Travellers. Our player pool is shrinking and with it the incentive for 
publishers to support us with new material. The TML list just compiled wasn\'t 
very long. How many of us running/participating in campaigns actively seek 
fresh meat, I mean players? How many of us talk the game but haven\'t sat down 
at a table with other players in a long, long time?  When was the last time 
you saw Traveller featured at a Con? Maybe you have, but I haven\'t. I 
provided some prize support for the Con in my area and specified it for 
Traveller. The Con staff called back and said nothing was scheduled, did I 
have a second preference? And this was a Con SJG attended.
   Are many of us just closet gamers, meeting secretly and never sharing with 
our aquantances/co-workers our hidden passion? Are we embarrassed at still 
playing an "old" game? Am I preaching to the choir? Probably, but I worry 
that the current generation of fellow Travellers is shrinking (as recent sad 
news points out-sorrow :-( ) without a new generation rising in its place. I 
think its past time to give our game some visability.

Advanced materials _might_ exist at any given TL.  In general, \'early\' in any TL, no advanced materials should be available, since they have not yet been developed (or in the TU, the machinery to work with them has not been set up).

No, you can\'t use 1.65 Gs.  Contragravity merely negates gravity, it doesn\'t give any bonus thrust.  It basically means you can figure travel times as if they were straight-line paths in deep space (with no major gravitational fields involved).

Apparently designed with GURPS Vehicles.  I\'ve never seen any worksheets attached to it, but I\'ve done similar designs, and decided they were sort of stupid.

I don\'t know.  The vehicle designs in Star Mercs were generally contributed, but I don\'t know who did that particular one.

The basic \'you can get a job\' level is usually 12.  Some areas require higher skill, however.  Doctor being one of those heavily trained professions, the average skill level for doctors is probably significantly higher than for most professional skills.

There aren\'t any published with TCS, and the Rebellion/TNE pop multipliers
aren\'t balanced.  I did some up for the current game.

I\'m actually playing as New Home, while moderating.  I have two neutral guys
(who designed the neutral fleets, Zuflucht and Colchis) verify my builds and
orders.

The first turn\'s largest battle was an attempt by a significant power to 
conquer New Home.  He was not prepared for massed mesons.  I allowed him
to tow his cripples and retreat after the first HG exchange.

The battles so far have either been easy math (small neutral fighter
squadron vs. powerful player fleet) or played on IRC...  That worked real 
well...

This was a pain in the ***; however, I just finished converting it over to 
Microsoft Access...  All I have to do is update the "task group table", and
two queries handle the "forces report" (where all your stuff is), and the 
"status report" (what your stuff can see).

I\'ve added a pre-game intelligence rule (40% of starting tonnage and all 
older [previous TL] designs) and a tactical intel (what you can see).

Check out the ct-starships archive at egroups.com for more details!
We\'re reposting the pre-game intel designs right now, due to the need
for some design corrections :)

For most games I would agree ... but with Traveller a lot of  the
background comes from extrapolation of published works (a process
the TML has raised to a fine art).  With  different  versions  of
Traveller comes different  technical  architectures  (implied  or
stated) and thus different extrapolations are valid.  So you  may
not have a consistant background across all systems.

I don\'t think its just a Traveller phenomenon,  my  local  gaming
club has dwindled over the years and is  about  to  fold  due  to
complacency and apathy.  Over the years I have introduced several
people to RPGs and many of them to Traveller  but  the  scope  to
continue this is almost gone now.  Its almost  as  if  everyone\'s
accepted the inevitability of the demise of gaming.

One bright spot, however,  is  that  BITS  ran  3  separate  RPGA
sactioned adventures during this  year\'s  Gencon  UK!  BITS  were
even short of Referees and in my group some of the  players  were
new to Traveller.  So Traveller is  visible  and  attracting  new
players (albeit usually from experienced gamers).

New Mini Microwave Thruster For Satellites Is Most Powerful In
Its Class

October 15, 1999, University Park, Pa. ---- Penn State engineers
have miniaturized a satellite propulsion system they originally
built with parts from a microwave oven and produced a new
thruster that draws only as much electricity as a light bulb,
but puts out more thrust than any system in its class. 

Only 2 inches long and 1.25 inches in diameter, the new
mini-thruster depends on a microwave generator used in weather
radar, aircraft radios and other communications applications
instead of the larger kitchen oven magnetron used in the earlier
prototype. Performance tested under simulated space vacuum
conditions using as little as 80 Watts of power, the new
mini-thruster produced the highest thrust for a
continuously-operating low power electrothermal thruster...

The thruster concept is based on the fact that microwaves can be
used to create and maintain a free-floating plasma or superheated,
electrically charged gas within a cavity... If a cold "propellant"
gas is passed through or around the hot plasma in the cavity, the
cold gas will become heated and create thrust when allowed to flow
out through a nozzle. 

Since the plasma creates temperatures higher than those possible
by chemical combustion, the plasma creates more thrust from the
same amount of cold "propellant" gas than chemical combustion...

In recent tests,...[the system was] operated...using nitrogen,
helium and ammonia as propellant gases. The thruster can also
potentially be operated with water as propellant. By means of
spectroscopy, the helium velocity at the nozzle exit was found to
be about 13,000 meters per second. That is the highest measured
specific impulse for a continuously operating low power
electrothermal thruster...

We had a discussion about this very subject as Imperium games was falling.
There are a number of things working against us as Travellers though. In the
two decades since Traveller originally came out, the sci-fi aesthetic has
changed completely. The foundations that Traveller was built on are not
nearly as strong as they used to be.

>The TML list just compiled wasn\'t
>very long. How many of us running/participating in campaigns actively seek
>fresh meat, I mean players?

I\'ve introduced a number of younger players (between about 18 and 25 or so)
to Traveller in recent years. I\'m not just saying this to toot my own horn,
I\'m saying this because it\'s a very difficult process. As I mentioned
already, the sci-fi aesthetic has changed thanks to a major revolution in
the genre. It\'s the 80s and post-80s sci-fi (what is traditionally known as
Cyberpunk) that the new breed of roleplayers have grown up with and have
fallen in love with.

It is no accident that stores can\'t keep GURPS Ultra-Tech, GURPS Ultra-Tech
II and GURPS Bio-tech in stores.

There is a real downside to the above. In alot of peoples\' minds, the only
good sci-fi is Gibsonian: low lifes and computer hackers running around in a
Blade Runner Japanese-American world popping on chrome arms and getting
skill implants. [Not that I have anything against Gibson, on the contrary, I
like him quite a bit, it\'s just unfortunate that the most banal aspects of
his writing seem to get the most attention].

The real problem is that it doesn\'t look, sound, or feel like Traveller. I\'m
not saying this to simply make excuses for why Traveller fandom has been
shrinking (or more importantly, has been gaining slower in relation to other
games). I\'m saying this because it\'s the hard reality of our situation as
fans. It has been my experience that Traveller feels dated to young people
today.

It\'s not just the technology, although I think that it does play a large
part. I used to focus on that quite a bit years ago. You are dealing with
people who have grown up with high-tech and don\'t see any signs of it
slowing down. We can handwave it away for whatever reasons we can come up
with, but it\'s still something that\'s an issue. It was one of the biggest
issues in my previous campaigns.

There are other issues that aren\'t effectively addressed in the 3I setting.
If you read an author like Sterling, you might see what I mean. He puts
cultures on earth that are plausible, yet distinctly alien. High-tech
muslims, gift-based panarchies, zerowork movements, gerontocratic societies,
information pirates as new great powers... and when he writes off world, the
mix gets even more exciting, post-human societies, ideological technocrats,
etc. [If you\'ve not read Schismatrix, shame on you, go out to your local
library or bookstore and check it out. I don\'t think you\'ll be disappointed]

Actually, now that I think of it, it\'s not just that the sci-fi aesthetic
has changed. The *world* has changed in the intervening years since
Traveller began, or more properly, our understanding of the world has
changed. All of this has begun to trickle down into sci-fi. Things have
changed in the history community, the neo-Marxist voices have quieted down
quite a bit in the last decade or so, which has allowed for different, more
radical understandings of history. "Liberal humanism" has lost its dominance
over literary theory, which has helped to deepen our understanding of
literature in general. In the liberal arts in general, the last twenty years
have been insane.

Okay... to distill that down, our understanding of the world is radically
different than it was 20 years ago. In turn, that understanding of the world
was radically different than it was 20 years before... and so on.

Let\'s face it... The noted cyberpunk author Greg Bear recently did a prelude
book for Foundation. I can\'t express how important that is as a symbolic
act. Asimov\'s universe is clearly one of the strongest influences on the
Third Imperium... and it\'s been added to by a thoroughly modern voice.

I don\'t propose anything. I\'m just popping my head up for my [roughly]
annual, "We have to admit Traveller does not appeal to the youth of today,"
statement.

>How many of us talk the game but haven\'t sat down
>at a table with other players in a long, long time?

Too long right now (and it\'s been less than a year for me).

>our aquantances/co-workers our hidden passion? Are we embarrassed at still
>playing an "old" game?

I don\'t think it\'s just that. Older adults have never been a huge segment of
the roleplaying market. If you don\'t get new players by the time that they
come out of college, it\'s unlikely you\'re going to get them at all. I was
lucky. I found my older brother\'s Traveller stuff when I was really, really
young and it ignited my imagination.

>Am I preaching to the choir? Probably, but I worry
>that the current generation of fellow Travellers is shrinking (as recent

>news points out-sorrow :-( ) without a new generation rising in its place.

A new generation of players means changes in the way that the Traveller
universe works. We\'ve got a number of voices here on the TML who are experts
in one or more areas, whether they\'re "armchair experts" like me, or
professionals. I would say that I think that it\'s high time to start
harnessing this wealth of information... but it\'s already happening. The
Traveller Culture Mailing list and the recent re-emergence of the HIWG
Mailing List attest to that.

I\'ll say what I\'ve said many, many times in the past: As long as there is a
DGP hegemony over canon, Traveller\'s background will stagnate. Fortunately,
things have changed a little bit since the publishing of GURPS Traveller.

>I think its past time to give our game some visability.


I agree. Mike Peters and I were talking about running Traveller demo games
at our FLC/GS, but that idea seemed to peter out (no pun intended). I\'m
still very interested, even though I have considerably less time to do it
now that I\'ve made the leap from part-time student to full-time student.

Exactly.  The dilemma of the modern US Army is that they are being asked
to be simultaneously a 21st-century war fighting machine -- optimized for
slugging it out with technologicially similar opponents on a gadget-rich
battlefield in open, free-for-all combat -- and a \'peace force\', optimized
for \'friendly\' occupation and low-intensity policing of territory in the
presence of possible guerilla or partisan (or even lone civilian)
attacks.

The Army\'s response (slow and uncertain though it may be) seems to be to
split the force between these roles, rather than trying to do both with
\'standard\' infantry divisions.  A new force structure is being examined,
with lighter, more easily mobilized divisions being used in \'humanitarian\'
and police-action roles, while more traditional heavy mech infantry deals
with pitched battles.  It seems as reasonable a course as any; the two
roles certainly require vastly different equipment, training, and (perhaps
most importantly) attitudes among the soldiers.

The UN intervention in Timor was instructive in this regard.  The Ghurkas
were among the first units on the ground, and their initial mission was
purely tactical (securing the airfield and embassy).  Very quickly,
though, they transitioned into serving as more of a psychological than a
physical force; even with less than 200 of them on the scene, there was
apparently a wide (and prudent) unwillingness among would-be bad guys to
continue misbehaving with even the threat of going up against such
legendarily effective troops.  The Ghurkas, being at the pinnacle of
professionalism and training, served admirably in both roles (they were
widely complimented on their friendliness and helpfulness to civilians and
Indonesian troops, for example).  Less seasoned and confident troops may
fair far less well in similar situations.

A big part of the problem in both those conflicts was a lack of clear
goals, and a total mismatch between what goals there were and both the
forces dispatched and the realities encountered in the field.  Clausewitz
would weep.

The reason I made the statement was because my calculations 
came out the same either way.  Perhaps you can show me where 
my calculations are wrong.  It has been years since I took physics.

Assume 200 mi orbit. d = (at^2)/2

This first formula assumed reaching orbit with CG.

200 mi = ((accShip - accPlanet) x Time x Time) / 2

Now we can negate the affects of the planet\'s pull because of CG.

200 mi = ((0.65g - 1gPlanet + 1gCG) x Time^2) / 2 
200 mi = ((0.65g) x Time^2) / 2

(200 * 5280)ft = (((32 ft/(sec^2)) * 0.65)) / 2) ((x^2)(sec^2))
1056000 = 10.4 * (x^2)

Time or x = 318.65 secs.

This second formula assumed reaching orbit without CG (we will 
pretend it adds 1 g of acceleration to ship for purposes of reaching 
orbit).

200 mi = ((accShip - accPlanet) x Time x Time) / 2

200 mi = ((1.65g - 1g) x Time^2) / 2
200 mi = ((0.65g) x Time^2) / 2

(200 * 5280)ft = (((32 ft/(sec^2)) * 0.65)) / 2) ((x^2)(sec^2))
1056000 = 10.4 * (x^2)

Time or x = 318.65 secs.

Unless I am suffering from a Gross Conceptual Error I believe you 
can make the assumption I made.  Where did I go wrong?

FYI, the most recent issue of Science (October 1st, 1999) has a great
section on recent advances in our understanding of planetary formation.
There\'s a bunch of articles on everything from extrasolar planets to the
possibility of liquid water in the core of Charon (!).  The main points
seem to be: 1) Planet formation is incredibly chaotic and random, 2) Life
may exist in a wider range of places than previously thought.

Definately of interest to those with a thing for planet/system design.

Well first of all, you\'re talking about a different case now -- 0-200 miles is not the same as going to 100D, which is what was referred to before.  Secondly, the two figures aren\'t the same because CG is directed straight down only, which may not be the most useful direction for it (note that a ship capable of 1.65 Gs can apply 1 G for lifting and 1.31 Gs for accelerating towards orbital velocity...)

I\'ve done some thinking about this, and while I recognize that the 
cyberpunk aspects of the sci-fi genre are popular, I don\'t think that\'s
the problem.

The problem is that Traveller is associated with the "tramp freighter"
view of science-fiction.  While cyberpunk is very popular right now,
there\'s one other area that is popular, and much more Traveller in feel:
"fleet actions".  Personally, I\'ve always been bored with the "tramp
freighter" storyline, and I\'ve always enjoyed a more political, military
feel to my sci-fi.

Anyone who\'s read David Weber\'s Honor Harrington series or its numerous
copycats on this list will immediately recognize the Traveller feel.
However, I\'ve NEVER seen any published Traveller materials which go in 
this direction.  I have great hopes for GURPS Imperial Navy (or whatever
its going to be called).

It\'s not over yet.  There\'s a future for Traveller.

Yes, I know.  I should submit an adventure to Pyramid.  I was sort of
waiting for GURPS Imperial Navy though...

Of course that depends on how the GM runs things.  It is certainly
possible to run a cinematic Traveller campaign.  This relates to
what I say below.

This may not be a problem.  GM\'s who tend to allow player\'s skills
to rise to very high levels are also the ones who are going to be
willing to let players perform "impossible" tasks.  So maybe
the way to go is to peg "impossible" so it makes the _best_ of
a "realistic" campaign (say an 18) able to only do the impossible
in very rare circumstances.  So if "impossible" is a -14 or -15,
then you a "very good" character (15, 16) won\'t be able to
suceed at all.  A "best of the best" character (say a 18) will
be able to suceed on a critical sucess  (and will critically
fail on something like a 14+ :-).  If you get up into "cinematic"
levels (say 20+), then you start having real chances to suceed.

I probably would go closer to Rob\'s here though.  I could see the
best in the entire Imperium having a 22.  It is really high, OTOH,
we are talking the best of a _lot_ (trillions?) of people.  Top
2% might be a 18 and 20 might be best in the sector.

Heck, I have a minor in pysics.  What your doing it mixing systems
and playing on the unfamiliarity of American units.  The fact is
that there are consitent sets of English units too and I have
had engineers who have told me that, to them, the most important
thing is to be able to redily refer to reference works, archived
spec, etc. and say American is way to go for them. (I don\'t
remember what subfield of engineering they were in).

I\'m cool with that opinion, and I largely agree with it - but allow me a few
corrections, please.

"...missing the point of RPGs: the GM uses the game as a meduim to TELL A
STORY." - I\'ll see your point and raise:  Rule #1 in my GMing manual says
"First, make sure everyone has a good time."  As GM, my job is to see that
my players leave with the feeling that the game session was time well spent.
Its like hosting a party.  Telling a story is a very good way to do this,
especially in a RPG, but this concern does not override the need to
entertain.  Storytelling and having a good time are not necessarily
synomomous.

"...depending on how it influences the GM\'s plot" - presumes the GM *has* a
plot.  As Chris, points out, many Traveller campaigns are intended from the
get-go to be \'plotless\', character-driven games.  This does NOT preclude
drama, or even a story, btw.

"These games are not simulations of reality." - I can\'t resist some sarcasm
here: DUH.  <sorry!>  It\'s actually a good point - there *are* gamers out
there that will slam a rule system because its not \'realistic enough\'.  The
degree of realism in a game is another personal style thing, as far as I\'m
concerned, but none are truly realistic.  That\'s what makes it a game, after
all.  But most games are simulations, nonetheless.

Allow me to quote myself:  "...this is the \'Simulation Layer\', where the
imaginary game world is modeled."  Lets emphasize that word _imaginary_ some
more.  My favorite computer game right now is EverQuest, an online CRPG
which is very much a simulation, and is not even remotely realistic.  Its a
virtual fantasy world, where despite the fact that my character interacts
with the world in three \'virtual\' dimensions, the realism is kept to a
minimum by both the fantasy RPG themes and the technological limitations of
the game itself.  This task system discussion was not about realism.

"Check out the framework for Cinematic Roleplaying at..." - hey man, your
still using dice?  How pass!  <just kidding!!!>  If anyone reading this
isn\'t already familiar with the Amber Diceless Role Playing Game (Eric
Wujik, Phage Press), I highly recommend it as a perspective twisting jaunt
in RPG mechanics.  : P

As far as "losing sleep" goes, I would\'ve been up late anyway, its just a
question of how many Orcs I would\'ve slain in Crushbone if I hadn\'t spent
the time writing that post.  ; )

I agree, you will need to design couriers and pay for them.

I\'m still in the process of writing up my initial draft of the house rules
for this game, and will post them soon to the players. I\'m also thinking of
setting up a list on onelist or egroups, for general postings, and another
for lurkers, but as I\'ve never run a list before I\'m not entirely certain
what would be the best way of implementing this, advice gratefully accepted

Heh.  All I\'m saying is its not the *game\'s* job to tell a story.  : )  The
storytelling, if any, must reside at a much higher layer of abtraction than
the RPG mechanics.  The degree to which a game\'s rules hinder good
storytelling is a very worthwhile discussion, however.

My take on this is that \'drama vs. simulation\' is a false dichotomy.  I have
plenty of respect for diceless and live-action RPGs (and especially PBEM\'s,
which I\'ve dabbled in myself), and was once caught up in the \'role-play\' vs.
\'roll-play\' mindset.  I eventually came to the realization that *most*
gamers truly enjoy rolling dice.  Mine certainly do.  Does that make them
bad role-players?  No.  We all know who the Munchkins are - and they\'re not
the only ones playing \'rules-heavy\' dice games.

Players enjoy rolling dice *because* its dramatic.  Rolling dice in Vegas is
drama as gambling.  Rolling dice in a RPG is betting your character\'s
abilties against the price of losing, or not acting at all.  Rolling dice is
the player\'s way of controlling their character\'s destiny outside the GM\'s
control.  We don\'t allow them to just say "I kill the monster and take it\'s
treasure!" or "I fix the jump drive with plenty of time to spare!", but we
do let them roll for it.  I totally understand the idea of \'secret rolls\',
but have decided for my games that I will never roll dice for a player,
because that takes away a fun activity.  Fun is job #1.  : )  For \'uncertain
tasks\', I get up and watch the player roll the dice, look at the result, and
then simply tell them what happens as a result.  If a percieved loss of
drama occurs, because the player can infer \'secret\' statistics from this,
then its a worthy sacrifice, IMO.

The most common question is a Shadowrun game is "what is my target number?"
While this sounds mechanistic, an experienced player is not really asking
"tell me a number" or "tell my a diffuculty rating", the real question is
"how smart is my opponent?" or "how sophisticated is this alarm system?"  If
a player tries to spoof his way past a security guard, and I say "roll Fast
Talk (6)", then he\'s learned that *this* guard is unusually smart and he
should feel free to start sweating this one out.  : P

How about game rules that actively enable dramatic tension?  Shadowrun has a
game mechanic called the Karma Pool.  This is a pool of points, purchased
with experience, which can be used during the game to re-roll failures.
Very handy, and an absolute must for higher level characters going against
tremendous odds.  The kicker is, the pool only refreshes when I, the GM,
says it does.  <grin>  The Karma Pool represents an abstract combination of
luck, experience, fate, and deus ex machina.  I only refresh this pool at
major plot points or between primary encounters.  Players sometimes starve
for Karma; at other times it is like a famous Chinese curse.

Player:  "I open the air lock."

Me:  "Karma refesh everyone."

Players in unison: "Oh, sh_t!"

I bet there are some drama queen wannabes out there that think it\'s ironic
that \'role-playing\' games evolved from old grognard wargames.  What could
possible be more dramatic than war?  (No offense intended toward any *real*
drama queens!  : P  )

On the question of "what then, is a non-sim dramatic game?", I would say any
game which substitues a scripting system of some kind for \'rules\', has no
simulation element.  And that\'s cool, too.  I like apples *and* oranges (but
I don\'t try to equate them or say one is intrinsically better than the
other).

I would say, fortunately.  Let extremist forever be frustrated by they\'re

It\'s a half life thing. The original Supernova thread was quoting that it had
been worked out that the _neutrino_ density from a Supernova had been calculated
to be dense enough to sterilize planets at IIRC several light years.

So I thought total conversion at say 5 metres might just be equal to a Supernova
at 5 light years.

My astronomy textbook says that Supernova 87 produced 10E58 neutrinos in around
10 seconds and that a million people on Earth had a neutrino interaction in
their bodies as a result. This is at a distance of 175,000 light years from the
supernova.

To work it out you need to postulate the nuclear equations for total conversion
and the amount of H2 fuel you burn per second. You also need to know what
neutrino density is fatal. None of which I know.

After finding the number of design errors made in the original GT, I don\'t take
anyone else\'s designs at face value. Nothing personal. 

BTW I have been unable to exactly match your implied fusion thruster design
stats using both short term and long term access, and by shifting TLs.

Hmm, I have a feeling that would be very limiting on my ability to post designs
of my own. I am quite keen to get as many GTL9 modules and designs into the
public domain as possible before Starships comes out. I would have thought
independent design is as useful as design verification.

What\'s the general view of play testers and refuseniks, particularly gearheads? 
Is it more fun in (hands tied) than out (hands free)?

I beg to differ; given what we\'ve seen of Storm Troopers, the task
should be rated as Routine, rather than Difficult. ;-)

Fuel consumption for HePLAR in FF&S2 is 1.25 X 10^(-3) m3 LH2/hr/kN
thrust.
So for the neutrino drive, fuel rate 1.67 X 10^(-3) m3 LH2/hr/tonne
thrust (10kN).
This is equal to 116g LH2, or 1.044 X 10^(16) J/hr, from E=mc^2
Power output = 2.9 X 10^12 W/tonne thrust
Flux = 2.9 X 10^15 W/m2 t-plate area

The radiological quality factor of neutrinos is kind of irrelevant with
this sort of power output, at least close up. At \'ground zero\', no
matter will tolerate energy fluxes of this magnitude - it will convert
to plasma.

The inverse square law applies with increased distance from the thruster
plate.

The dramatic increase in the Caesarian rate is an
obstetric fad rather than being based in any \'medical science\', or
any change in the average dimensions of womens\' pelves (these are, in
general, getting larger as nutrition improves).
	There are several factors involved, some of which include :-
- - Women don\'t want to have overly painful labours or any of the
potential long-term complications of vaginal delivery (from perineal
tears, incontinence, etc.)
- - Obstetricians are desparately afraid of being sued.
Consider this : an obstetrician\'s medical defence insurance is about
$50000 per year in Australia/NZ, and almost $100K US/yr in North
America.
You have to work pretty hard when you\'re going to make less than
$1500 per delivery - this figure includes all antenatal
consultations, etc.

Leonard is correct that being overly thin (<50kg for average adult
female height) puts you at greater risk of complications during and
after pregnancy. Lack of weight gain during pregnancy (~8-10kg typical
minimum) is another risk factor.
	Interestingly, previous eating disorder is a risk factor
for post-natal depression or psychosis during pregnancy.
	List members may or may not be aware of the data from those
women which fell pregnant in Holland during the Nazi occupation
(the entire populace towards war\'s end were on starvation rations, 
~900-1000kcal/d). Their children were at greater risk of several 
conditions in later life, due to maternal malnutrition.

Hmm... maybe it would be worthwhile doing a \'done to death\' on this
topic.

Absolutely. Everyone was trying to be very polite and not provoke a
flamewar. This was nothing like the Virus, RoM TL, Fighters, Great T4 Task
Debate, and Pirates threads which have been before. Pat, have a look back
in the archive for the TML in 96/97 for some good flamewars.

That\'s true, and the tolerance threshold tends to drop proportionate to the
size of the reposted sections... ;-)

And this is not scientific?

Would YOU be willing to wear diapers or have painful intercourse for the
rest of your life in order to have a "natural" birth?

Perineal tears and incontinence don\'t seem like such a big deal until they
happen to you, or to your lover.

Sorry, I know this is OT, but I think that incontinence and perineal tears
are a very big deal-- and for me, this is not an academic issue.

ObTrav, just for fun: I recall an episode of a spy series some years ago*,
in which the hero\'s ID card had been stolen. He was dreadfully concerned
about getting it back, since it was his passport into some of the highest
security areas in the nation (or at least in his particular worldwide
spy organization).

If he didn\'t get it back pronto, his superiors would have to cancel it
until it could be recovered - and that might take years. He knew of
a colleague who had their card stolen, who ended up working a desk
until retirement.

Imagine how that kind of thing would work in an environment with the
communication delays of the Third Imperium.

Sorry, I know this is OT, but I think that incontinence and perineal tears
are a very big deal-- and for me, this is not an academic issue.
>>>>>>>>>
Having a natural birth isn\'t some kind of obligation women had in the
dark old days that the caesarian section procedure has freed them from.

So much depends on the woman involved. A natural birth is hard work,
painful, and can be risky - but recuperation afterwards is generally very
rapid. A caesarian can be faster and less painful, and can trade one
set of risks for another that the attending doctor may be more familiar
with - and a recovery time that is generally longer than that of a natural
birth. Of course, a caesarian is abdominal surgery...with the added bonus 
that you have a newborn to take care of while recuperating from it. 

I\'m naturally a bit biased. My wife has had three children, natural, with no 
complications from the birth itself - though she had *lots* of complications 
during the pregnancy. My sister-in-law had a caesarian, the navy doctor 
sank the scalpel into my unborn niece\'s cheek.

Whichever procedure gets your family back home in the best of health
is the right one.

No, but if a woman is in danger of having a huge tear or damage to her

How very true.  If my caesarian had taken place three hours earlier, my
daughter would ALSO be alive.  As it is, it took me two years to recover...

Felix: Conceptual problem ... this would be fairly accurate, assuming no
atmosphere and not having to account for existing rotational velocity
(which, upon lift-off, becomes a linear velocity tangential to the point
where you turned on CG and broke contact (fluid or solid) with the rotating
body.). Atmospheric friction issues can really slow you down. Buildings in
the way once the planet no longer pulls you around can be a problem...

5 minutes and 20 seconds to orbit *distance* IS reasonable, assuming you
don\'t plan on orbiting.

Well, if you are using vectored thrust and CG, the ship doesn\'t have 
to point upwards; you can use all the thrust for straight up.  

But I agree with you.  For flying purposes, it may not be the most 
efficient method.

David asked:
>Where is what Norris had to do to retreive that Imperial warrant
described?

Hmm, let\'s see:

1.   A Warrant, and its associated powers, is first described in _Adventure
1: The Kinunir".

2.   The Warrant is a playing piece in the 5FW boardgame. Whichever Admiral
has the Warrant, becomes the highest-ranked Admiral (able to leap small
buildings, etc ;-).

3.   The first mention that Norris uses a Warrant to dismiss Santanocheev
is in a TAS News Service article, JTAS ?? (maybe #15?).

4.   The _Spinward Marches Campaign_, p 11 (thanks Hans) says: "Norris
appealed directly to the Emperor of the Imperial forces in the Marches
[...] Although the Emperor responded by issuing a warrant which put Norris
in command, it was lost en route; due to the distances and transit times
involved, the very existence of the document remained unknown."

And on p. 16 it further says: "Norris, with some slight evidence that his
warrant from the Emperor was on Algine (aboard a wrecked cruiser down on
the planet), led a secret expedition to that interdicted world to recover
the document. The quandary that faced Norris was that he was prohibited
from going to the interdicted world of Algine without the express
permission of the Emperor. The warrant, if it was there, would be
permission to go there; if it wasn\'t there, he risked his career."

5.   From my Kinunir page: "The _Regency Sourcebook_ and now _Behind The
Claw_ (the latter presumably quoting the former) state that the ship was
discovered at Shionthy in 1105. The other ships of the class were then
"fixed" (they talked to the AI computers with a very large hammer ;-)."

Both books also state that Norris retrieved "his" Warrant from the Kinunir,
although if you read the rest of my page you\'ll realise this cannot be
true.


Enough so far? ;-)

This is true.

He also had an Imperial warrant signed by Strephon that allowed him to sack
Santocheev during the Fith Frontier War and take personal command of all
Imperial forces.

But he needed the authority of the Warrant to make it legal to appoint

Nice site. A civilian airliner with a spinal mount laser shoehorned into
it.

I know they designed this thing for Theater Missile defense, but how
long is it going to be before someone decides to try it out on an enemy 
airplane? Or an enemy ground unit?

I wonder what it could do to a late-model russian-built fighter...

Ha!  Ha!  <g> Yes, I\'m a heretic, but I still prefer "missing for a
week" jump drives for my FTL.

As you know, you can travel though empty space with stutterwarp just
fine.  It\'s the 7.7 ly, optional, limit before deep gravity
discharge that can create chokepoints.  One interesting possibility
is to vary that distance by TL, perhaps 3/4 * TL

It\'d be even easier with Alderson drives. Of course then you have to
deal with fixed jump points, which change system defence beyond
recognition.

That\'s an Isp of about 127,400. I wonder what the max thrust is?

Assuming
	power = Ve * thrust

I get about 6 millinewtons. Now if we could scale it up to use 80
*gigawatts*, then it\'d produce 6 meganewtons. But I doubt it\'ll scale
well.

Well, the simple fact is that the sort of "future" universe Traveller
is set in is no longer a "possible" future (or at least a *really*
unlikely one). 

Traveller is *now* a lot closer to games like Space:1889 in that its
setting is something we *used* to think could be the future.

Now, unless something major happens, we are far more likely to reach
the "post-human stage" (Vingean Singularity) *before* we reach the
stars. And that changes *everything*. 

So we have to *conciously* recognize that Traveller\'s most *basic*
assumptions require weak technological progress in general, and in
specific: *no* nanotech, and very little biotech and cybertech. 

Yet at the same time, it\'s a "hard science" game. 

So we need to keep this "alternate reality" nature of the game in mind
when working on it.

And I seem to recall hearing that once you have a child by caesarean,
you *have* to have any future children that way or risk the old scar
popping open during labor.

So at 10 AU, that\'s a flux of about 40 million neutrinos per square
meter. At 5 AU it\'d be 4 times that or 80 million neutrinos per square
meter. 

BTW, are you *sure* about that 1e58 figure? It seems kinda low.

Actually, all we need is the average momentum per neutrino. That will
give us the number of neutrinos as a function of thrust.

That\'s not true, actually. (asked the wife (she\'s a surgeon)) Was
(is?) commonly held by lay people (maybe even docs years ago), but
not within the medical profession these days. 

As to "fashion" and c-section (from original post, not Leonard\'s)
it was the fashion of _H._sapiens_ to have a high rate of death in 
childbirth for both mother and child for most of our history.

It might be a while before it is used on a plane.  The ABL destroys
ballistic missiles by heating the propellant tanks on the missiles for
a minute or so, until the metal loses its temper and ruptures due to 
the propellant\'s pressure.  (Since the propellant tank must be under 
pressure, the missile must be engaged during its boost phase.)  Aside
from blinding pilots and troops it wouldn\'t have much effect on 
other targets.  Still, such a weapon is probably coming...

With Kearny-Fuchida drives* you can only jump \'near\' stars, and there are
normally only two safe jump points per system.  Of course you\'d then have
a range of 30 light years.  Plus the ability to use the unreliable \'pirate\'
jump points makes piracy more practical ;->

	I believe that the point being made was that the increase in

	and more women making the choice to avoid unnecessary pain
	and discomfort, rather than an increase in the necessity of
	caesarian deliveries caused by shrinking hips.

It\'s easy and fun to get lost in the Traveller universe
but...we really *are* exploring space.

Today marks the 10th anniversary of the launch of the
Galileo spacecraft from Space Shuttle Atlantis during
the STS-34 mission.

Carried into orbit by Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-34),
Galileo was propelled out of Earth orbit by an Inertial
Upper Stage booster rocket.  It arrived at Jupiter in
December 1995.

En route to Jupiter, Galileo flew past Venus once and Earth
twice, using gravity assists to give the spacecraft enough
energy to get to Jupiter.  Galileo obtained the first close-up
images of an asteroid (Gaspra). Flying by the asteroid Ida,
Galileo also discovered the first known moon of an asteroid
(Dactyl).

Galileo gave us our only direct views of the crash of Comet
Shoemaker-Levy 9 into Jupiter\'s atmosphere.

Upon arrival, Galileo\'s probe penetrated Jupiter\'s atmosphere
and returned a Jovian weather report on temperature, pressure,
composition, winds and lightning.  Since then, the orbiter has
flown past Jupiter\'s Galilean moons a total of 25 times:
Callisto (7), Ganymede (4), Europa (12) and Io (2). During its
tour of the Jovian system, Galileo has made discoveries that
include extreme high temperatures at Io\'s volcanoes, indications
that there may be liquid water inside Europa, an internal magnetic
field for Ganymede, and has even raised the possibility of liquid
water inside Callisto.

Since launch, the spacecraft has accurately traveled a total of
5,539 million kilometers (3,442 million miles) and returned over
3.8 gigabits of data.

Not bad for a machine with a processor less powerful than an
obsolete Pentium.


ObTrav: Just use the info Galileo has generated.

Want a weird, dangerous planet for PCs to overcome? Show them the
surface of Io.

Want a challenging ship recovery mission? Use the details of
Europa or Callisto and have the PCs recover it from the ice.

How about having belters mine an asteroid and its moon?

Lots of pictures and videos to create the right gaming
"atmosphere"!

At shorter ranges, vs an aircraft (say, 50 miles) the heat load on the
plane will of course be many times greater - high enough, I would
expect, that softening the airframe would be fairly catastrophic to a
plane under any kind of aerodynamic load (or to the pilot.)

I\'ve said before - once laser weapons get deployed, they\'re going to
have roughly the same effect on aircraft that machineguns had on
cavalry. You can\'t dodge a laser...the days of the high-performance
manned fighter aircraft are numbered.

That laser-toting 747 doesn\'t exactly look like a well-armored warplane.
Once more than one side has airborne laser capabilities, will they
effectively counter each other? Or will someone just have to make
defensible (or disposable) flying laser platforms?

I wonder if ground-based anti-aircraft lasers would be a credible deterrent
yet.

Quite right.

I very much doubt that even an Imperial Warrant would allow anyone to appoint
himself Archduke, or even a lesser Imperial title. I have no evidence to
offer, I just think that is very unlikely. Certainly even an Imperial Warrant
will have some limit to its authority. At the very least it would fall short
of enabling the bearer to replace the Emperor. I just happen to think the
limit would extend to the creation of new Imperial nobles.

By the time anyone could have thought to question whether Norris had actually 
been made an Archduke, the Imperium was in the throes of rebellion, and any 
charges of lack of legitimacy were clouded by partisan politics.

Chris Seamans pinpointed a lot of issues I\'d only been vaguely
aware of: that each generation has a different way of enjoying
themselves.  I now have to face the possibility that Traveller
may not be entertainment-in-a-vacuum -- that its appeal may
be due to the 1970\'s, with all its hard-SF influences and veteran
wargamers.

If Traveller needs to flex to survive, then so be it.  A Traveller
that can accept the new trends while keeping the old might be
fine.  And Traveller might have to flow with the times, because
it is entertainment, and entertainment is not an objective reality.

So then, Traveller has some routes it can take that offer the new
to the young while keeping the traditional for the old.  The flexibility
is in options which the ref can keep or throw away.  For a classic
example, take psionics.  Our campaign has psionics in it, but we
haven\'t encountered it yet, nor do I think any of our characters
have it.

My suggestions would be to allow, and more importantly, set
bounds on, things relating to human/computer technology,
including

    nanotech
    cybernetics
    human-computer data interface

Nanotech need not be nanites-run-amok.  Set bounds on it and
explain how it works in the Imperium and why.  Allow it in strictly
controlled areas -- tiny, nanetic "clean boxes" -- becuase they\'re so
dang good that they\'ll even process metals, wastes, organics, flesh
and bone if set free.  A virus indeed.  Make them converters of
raw materials only, not builders.  Banana peels into gold, or some
such alchemy.

Cybernetics need not be Terminator.  Set bounds on it and explain
how it works in the Imperium.  We\'ve already got a good start on
it from T4.  My take would be to penalize social standing, and give
a probability of harming intelligence as well, per implant.

Human-computer data interface need not be cyberpunk.  Keep
what new gamers like about it and set bounds on it.  Frame it
in the context of the variety of systems and the space-time problems
of the Imperium.  Even classic Traveller had players hacking into
corporate mainframes.  And on some worlds they\'ll have to do just
that... but there will also be immersive, interactive environments.
I would suggest penalizing endurance for this kind of skill, and also
making endurance a requirement for hacking skill.

Oops.  I had my timeline muddled.  I was thinking (for no good reason) that
the Archducal appointment came immediately after the 5FW.

II. Fleet Maneuvers

What I would really like to see is the series of squadron
skirmishes that reduced the Corridor sector into a smoking
crater during 1117-1119.  Now there\'s a set of fleet actions!
I drew a map showing in general terms how the battle lines
moved during those years, and how the worlds fell and regrouped.
Some actually survived the Vargr incursions, some were swallowed
up into the Reformed Ziru Sirka, and most became just another
set of petty Vargr pocket empires.

Fleet actions would be cool.

The very definition of "hard science-fiction" is changing as well. It
actually has to do more with the nature of technology itself, and how it\'s
viewed. It\'s really difficult to explain... but I can try.

There used to be a time that a computer was computer. The device would exist
in a story to serve a purpose, and would to some degree act like the
computers that readers were already familiar with, but wouldn\'t exist in any
sort of cultural framework. We\'ve had a little more experience with the
practical applications of technology now, and how quickly technologies get
integrated into peoples\' lives. This changes things quite a bit. It\'s
bulletin board systems, eventually a global internet, it\'s sub-cultures, and
sub-sub-cultures utilizing the new technology in a number of different ways:
Christian themed BBSes, BBSes devoted to Grateful Dead tape trading, occult
and Wiccan BBSes, neo-Nazi BBSes and roleplaying BBSes that morph over time
into Traveller Mailing Lists, ezines and Project Gutenberg... and so on, and
so on (and Scooby Dooby Doo).

Suddenly, that computer doesn\'t look like just a computer anymore. That\'s
what dates sci-fi. It\'s not that older sci-fi authors got the technology
wrong, it\'s more that they got how that technology will fit into peoples\'
lives wrong, or in many cases they simply didn\'t try to see it. I don\'t
know, I chalk it up to a different way of viewing things.

Back when I first got on the list, I brought this issue up. Back then, I was
younger and more naive, and I thought that it was the technology of
Traveller that dates poorly. I\'m starting to realize that it\'s not the
technology itself as much as the *attitude* toward technology in Traveller.

The Imperium itself is really flat and static when it comes to technology.
The old fallback "conservative Vilani" handwave aside, the fact of the
matter is that all technologies have an impact on society that isn\'t
reflected in Traveller.

It becomes difficult, because new ideas have a nasty way of invalidating old
ones... and there\'s an arbitrary line that exists that defines which old
ones can\'t be changed. IMTU, they\'re all related to interstellar travel
speed, but for others it varies.

As an example: If cybernetic eyes become available, then there\'s an
assumption that a pair of cybernetic eyes could be integrated into a weapon
system. However, previous canon assumes that your average grunt has only his
general issue Mk. I eyeball to rely on...

The examples that can be given are pretty much endless.

Or integrate, but limit, the tech with already existing Traveller concepts.
Nanotech life extension technologies, for example. It updates the feel a
little bit, but it doesn\'t invalidate any canon, since the concept of life
extension already exists.

Or come up with a good reason why they\'re not used. Maybe certain types of
nanites are extremely sensitive to radiation, and they\'re not widely

The anti-cybernetics "rule" seems to be more of an anti-munchkin rule than
anything else. Personally, I\'ve always been a little bit baffled by the
concept myself. You take your average Imperial noble, ruler of many
worlds... why would they willingly subject themselves to the tyranny of not
being able to use cybernetics, which among other things, are extremely handy
for extending one\'s life. It would seem to me that cybernetics would be a
badge of rank in the Imperium, not a social stigma.

<sigh>

My personal opinion aside, I think that there are other valid ways of
getting around this. First of all, don\'t play with munchkins. ;) More
seriously, long recovery times, buggy hardware, difficult periods adapting
to the new cybernetics, the limits of the human body.

"Well, yeah, that cybernetic arm *is* rate for 1000 kg. Only problem is that
your body isn\'t." (GM to player after player\'s arm had seperated in a messy
fashion from his body when he tried to lift something way too heavy).

"Well, yeah, sure those cybernetic eyes looked really good at the Body Shop.
Did you really think that SuSAG is going to warn you that you\'re going to
get a migraine several times a week?"

In my opinion, these real limitations are the way to go... if you have a
desire to limit your players in these areas. In my opinion, they can make
things much more interesting than simply saying, "Hey, your character\'s a
pariah with those Ling-Standard eyes!" Due to the shadowy legal status of
most Traveller parties, I\'m not so sure why this is considered to be a
disadvantage at all. ;)

>Human-computer data interface need not be cyberpunk.

Of course not. It doesn\'t even have to be cybernetic (which would take the
cyber right out and just leave the punk, I guess). I\'ve always been fond of
Sterling\'s "spex" myself (instead of some funky neural jack, they\'re a
simple pair of glasses with a relatively powerful computer inside).
Something like this makes a heck of alot of sense anyway.

Or a whole new set of skills. You think Joe, early 1980s era computer
expert, is going to know how to hack in an immersive, interactive
environment?

Bob: "So, Joe, do you think you\'re our man? We go up against that Imperial
mainframe tonight."

Joe: "Heck yeah! I\'m a Unix wizard! You guys get me inside and you won\'t
need to worry about the rest."

Jane (whispers to Bob): "I think we should put him out of his misery."

Most of the "anti-new tech" canon was a result of attempts to keep things
"in hand" for the GMs of the world, or at least that\'s what it always looked
like to me. No cybernetics, because if they got introduced, everyone would
want new cybernetic arms and legs and smart guns... blah blah blah.

Ah, heck, I forget where I was going with this and I need to go get a
haircut.

But NOT in Deneb, which is why he used his blank stationery to pen his
own appointment to Archduke. That settled things _legally_ giving him a
measure of legitimacy just when he needed the maximum amount of
stability and support in the Domain.

The partisan politics in the Imperium were in part _due_ to the nebulous
legality of Dulinor\'s or Lucan\'s ascension to the throne. There were two
claimants to the throne with equally dubious legality.

Survival Margin is pretty clear that Norris knew he was committing fraud
with his appointment to Archduke, as he reminisces that at least in the
case of his sacking of Santanocheev (which he used the warrant for)
Strephon was at least around to smack him back down.

Uhmm, machineguns didn\'t kill cavalry, the internal combusion engine
did. Actually the MG had Llareggub effect on cavalry, the rise of repeating
rifles had already pretty much made them obsolete on the battlefield. I
actually think its not laser weapons that will killed manned aircraft but
masers. Much more effective to microwave the pilot.

To a degree.  Note that a few forms (campfire stories, for example) go
back into prehistory, and many others (ball games of one form or another)
go back thousands of years.  Even modern card games date to late Medieval
times.  So there are quite a few forms of enjoyment that remain pretty
stable across the generations.

That much I do tend to agree with.  One thing I wonder about is why
wargaming as a hobby went into a decline.  Some people point to the rise
of computer gaming to explain this, but the decline of wargaming predated
the availability of similarly complex computer substitutes by at least a
decade.

The problem one runs into here is that Traveller is and always has been
more than a rule set -- which is good, because it\'s had at least four
major and quite distinct rule sets, while remaining unmistakeably
Traveller throughout.  Traveller\'s primary attraction (for most people) is
its richly detailed background.

Unfortunately, that background is fundamentally driven by the
technological assumptions underlying Traveller.  Change these in any
nontrivial way -- through introducing more realistic projections of
computer technology, or biotech, or nanotech, for example -- and the
canonical history of the Imperium, and most of the source materials
related to it, cease to make any sense whatsoever.

You can use (one of) the Traveller rule set(s) and pick and choose which
rules to apply.  You can\'t use the canon background without psionics, as
the Zhodani are key to that background.

And even limited like this, nanites utterly ruin the entire economic model

But I love Traveller-- and I\'ve NEVER liked wargaming.  Not even a little
bit.  I get bored out of my *mind*.  The reason I so hated Magic: Crack
for Gamers and really hate computer games is that they killed face to face
roleplaying.  I don\'t want to interact with a screen and I want to play a
character in a world.  Traveller was such a huge universe-- so much to
explore, so much more to do than fight!

Traveller is space opera.  Not the game, but old fashioned space opera,
Empires in space, mysterious powers (the Zhodani) with mysterious powers,
nobles, messages that take forever to arrive, the final Frontier with the
emphasis on frontier, deadly and beautiful women (or boys/men), Imperial
warrants (right out of the Three Musketeers!), all that fun stuff.

And yes, pirates.

I think that including the new technologies would be possible-- but only
if you keep the feel of the universe in mind.

Space opera is what I love to write and read and play, always loved best.

Not really.  Masers have the problem that they have relatively poor beam cohesion, unless your projector is extremely large, and that \'cooking the pilot\' is absurdly simple to protect against.

There is some question as to whether a true weapons-grade laser (or maser) is even possible in atmosphere; high intensity lasers ionize air, making it opaque.  This is the advantage of a PAW in atmosphere -- ionization is a _bonus_ for them.

Assuming you can build cost-effective directed energy weapons capable of destroying aircraft, that will force aircraft to be heavily enough armored to deal with hits from directed energy weapons, or stealthy enough to avoid being hit, or with weaponry capable of taking out the projector; if none of these are possible, aircraft will be dramatically reduced in utility.  Note that improvements in missile technology have the same effect.

The most likely thing to kill manned aircraft is increased viability of unmanned aircraft.

The rise of computer games, the rise of roleplaying games, the complete lack
of an advertising market, fewer people interested in the subject matter and,
to put it bluntly, games that were generally too complex for their own good.

More than a task system. Although TNE and G:T veered off the track, CT, MT
and T4 all had similar character generation systems.

In the years I\'ve been on this list, I\'ve learned one very important thing:
canon is an illusion. That\'s not to say I disagree with having a relatively
solid foundation to build things on. It\'s a nifty peachy keen idea. I can
understand the reasoning for it. However, attention to canon can -- and
usually does -- go way too far. With the exception of a select few
fundamentals, no two Traveller players agree on elements of canon anyway,
and books frequently contradict each other. Still, self appointed guardians
of canon make sweeping changes on no authority whatsoever. Nobody ever asked
me if the Annic Nova should be de-canonized, or if Jump Torps should be
de-canonized, what about disposable Fuel Tanks? Are they canon this week or
not?

The debate that got started concerning Doug\'s concept for the Imperial
Marines was a perfect example of what I\'m talking about. Doug\'s idea was
said to be non-canon, yet many canon sources (including one of the holiest
of holy LBBs, Book 4: Mercenary) supported it.

Really? What did Traveller players do before the Zhodani even existed? ;)

Besides, one can still use *huge* segments of the Imperial background
without psionics. I strongly disagree with the position that Traveller *is*
the Imperial background. Despite my distaste for it some days, CT\'s
character generation system is more Traveller for me than a number of
elements of DGP canon.

There\'s always an exception to the rule. ;)

Yes... and Magic is also a large part of the reason that you can walk into
most comic stores in the U.S. and pick up roleplaying materials. The other
parts of the reason were Cyberpunk 2020 / Shadowrun and its successor The
Storyteller System.

[Before anyone calls me on this one, I *know* that the Storyteller System is
White Wold and Cyberpunk 2020 is R.Talsorian. Cyberpunk 2020, during its
very short period of popularity opened the door for "cool" roleplaying and
White Wolf stepped in and managed to do a better job].

Don\'t blame it all on computer games either. The RPG industry has had its
share of mismanagement and poor follow through (Imperium Games anyone?).
Very few RPG companies have actually advertised aggresively. TSR and White
Wolf both stand out... and not surprisingly, they\'re both the market
leaders.

[Of course, although computer games have "killed" face to face roleplaying,
they have created vast sprawling communities that are much more accessible
to your average teen in Podunksville, Alabama than RPGs ever were.]

Yep. You can also pilot a ship and / or trade and stuff... and talk to
nobles and call it diplomacy. You can fight alot. In fact, one might say
that the Imperium is set up in a fashion that encourages fighting. ;)

Some people have been known to gamble. If you\'re an Ithklur, you can annoy
Hivers and eat K\'Kree (is TNE considered canon by most this week?).

>Empires in space, mysterious powers (the Zhodani) with mysterious powers,


Well as long as the mysterious powers stay with the mysterious powers, I
think we\'ll be all right. ;) [I know you probably meant something else, but
I couldn\'t resist.]

>Space opera is what I love to write and read and play, always loved best.


Well,  Kiri, the big problem is that you won\'t find a whole lot of support
for Traveller as space opera here on the list. If you corner most folks
\'round here, they\'ll deny it vehemently. Personally, I don\'t disagree with
you too much, but there are still folks who cling to Traveller as some sort
of hard sci-fi.

Anyway, there is quite a lot of psychological attachment, if you please,
about keeping one\'s body as intact as possible.  You lose a part of
you when you lose a part of you.  Some philosophers think that the
soul and the body are only barely related, while others think perhaps
that the body affects the soul.

This is all too vague for supporting a Traveller rule; however, a push
in the right direction and you have psychological side-effects from
transplants which can\'t be altered.  The side effects may be good or
bad... just as physiological side-effects can be good or bad.

Even if you were to limit it to the Imperial regions, it\'s huge. I could
easily see regions having their own technological flavor, even in the same
period of history. And there is a canon framework from which to work. The
Solomani are more advanced in bio/med, less so in gravitics, the Vilani
advanced in gravitics, less so in bio/med, etc.

    'body' => 'Hi all.

One thing I\'ve always thought was "cool but hard to swallow" in SF is
amorphous aliens.  Has anyone used something akin to these in their TU? 

To my mind there are two basic types of these:  The ameboid and the
doppleganger.  Star Frontiers\' Dralasites were a fun but silly version of
the first type, while Odo from ST:DS9 is probably the most well-known
second type. Ameboids can change shape and maybe texture or color to a
limited degree but cannot imitate other beings or objects convincingly. 
Dopplegangers are more flexible and can mimic things with high fidelity.

IMO, the latter type are a little too "science-fantasy" for a Traveller
setting, but I\'ve been toying with the idea of introducing an ameboid race
to MTU.  My problem is coming up with a reasonable evolutionary course for
their development.  

One rather bizarre and almost Lovecraftian notion I\'ve been thinking about
is what I call the "bag of bugs" model of amorphous development.  In this
scenario the amoeba race is decended from some kind of hive-insect with a
queen+workers type of society.  Occasionally such hive-insects will mass
together for warmth and protection into a "big bundle of bugs" (the
technical term :-). I was thinking, what if such an insect species
developed the trait of creating a membranous sac around the mass for
further protection?  What if, over time, hives developed into essentially
single physical entities with queens at the center sending out pheromonal
messages to control her "body", made up of a mass of workers.  In some
sense this is what they already do, though in a more wide-rangeing and
less direct way.  The workers in the mass could hook together to create
different shapes.  Given enough time, sufficient control might be
developed to create manipulatory limbs and such.  

As evolution proceeded, the workers would lose much of the "baggage" 
needed to operate as individual entities, becoming essentially small cell
masses with the ability to interlock with others in various configurations
depending on the signals reaching them.  In order for intelligence to
develop, the queen would have to become a massively hypertrophied thing
with the brain integral to her alone, I think.  She would also become the
seat of primary metabolic function and so on, sending out nutrients to the
cell-masses that make up her body. 

Hmm, what about reproduction?  Essentially, one queen would lay another
queen, who would "lay" a bunch of workers to act as a body for herself.  

Well, I said the idea was bizarre, didn\'t I? :-)  I\'d really like to get
people\'s input and reactions to this idea.  Too outlandish?  Are there
major problems I haven\'t thought of?  

Ciao,
Charles C.

Anecdotes are great, because they\'re a self-selecting group, so you can find just about anything in them.

The canon, the background, is pure space opera.  That doesn\'t mean it\'s
NOT hard SF.  You can have space opera without psionics, and with
gearheads.  We had gearheads in our campaign, and then there were people
like me.  Countess Julissa Myal haut-Baris was known to carry messages for
Iolanthe.  She was also very good at seducing our enemies into spilling
things we weren\'t supposed to know, hiding things in Plain Sight, etc.

Space opera is the character type and story type; hard SF just means we
don\'t violate the laws of physics to an unbelievable extent.

Forget pagers and cell phones, too-- replace them with brain plug-ins.
But now you have, for all practical purposes, telepathy.  None of the
"forced rapport" a la the Alton Gift or the Vulcan Mind Meld, but you can
transfer information and converse without being overheard.  And no one
else need know you\'re doing it.  I mean, imagine the privacy violation if
someone demanded to see the list of phone calls you made with just your
brain.  (This would make extramarital affairs much easier, too.  Anyone
who\'s ever been the Other Person knows that the hardest thing to do is
call without being overheard by the spouse.)

The thing is, why should we *care* about what goes on in factories and
laboratories?  As long as nanotech is limited to industrial, (or medical)
settings, it\'s just another way of achieving the things we already assume
are happening.

The only real problem is that nanotech *might* upset Traveller\'s economics,
by making manufacturing trivially easy and cheap.  This would tend to lead
to something like Iain Banks\' "Culture" books - which are damn fine books,
but not really Traveller.  Although - "Consider Phlebas" does mostly
involve relatively Travellerish gear - Lasers, Suits, anti-grav, and so on.

Nanotech might actually help explain Traveller\'s slow rates of
technological development.  You see, most goods are produced by these
mysterious black boxes - you push the raw materials in here, push buttons
to select what you want produced, and collect the goods at the other end of
the machine.  You don\'t really need to know what is going on inside.

I am sorry that you have had a rough time with previous pregnancies.

From a statistical standpoint, however, 85% of pregnancies require no
assistance whatsoever, beyond basic antenatal care and adequate
nutrition.

Unfortunately, TTL 7-8 medicine can\'t easily predict which group you
will fall into.

I agree (surprise!). Actually, from reading _Survival Margin_, I think
Norris meant he used the Warrant to pardon his forgery of the Archducal
patent.

...although I\'m doubtful if the even the power of the Warrant could cover
this!

Correct, canonically. Se my Library Data for "Imperial Warrant" (and a
pic!). Here\'s an excerpt:

"Known uses for such warrants have included the establishment of colonies
in areas
requiring development, the assumption of military power in the midst of
crises, and the
unilateral establishment of new noble lines to administer provinces which
have suffered
from war or economic collapse."

...and a reply from Marc!!! So, can you give us the definitive version of
how Norris got his Warrant, or is it preferable to allow GM\'s to pick the
variant that suits their campaign?

BTW, the current variants are:
     1.   "Forge The Warrant!"
     2.   "Different Ship, Different Red Zone"
     3.   "The Footlocker Solution"
     4.   "In The Shoes Of His Father"

See my website -> Tavonni Repair Bays -> "The Kinunir Question" for full

First of all, keep in mind that I did say that I agreed with you to some
extent.

Well sort of, maybe a little. Space opera genre that encompasses quite a
bit, and so is hard sci-fi. Story is secondary to genre, since most examples
of sci-fi are quite "dramatic" in that sense. It\'s all a question of
character.

Hard sci-fi is usually concerned with a certain degree of gritty realism
concerning the characters as well as the technology. Good movie examples of
hard sci-fi: Alien, Aliens. Good book example: The Moon is a Harsh Mistress.
The characters themselves are not larger than life. Many Traveller players
fall firmly into this camp.

Space opera, on the other hand, frequently has characters who are larger
than life. Technology plays something of a secondary role a Space Captain
who doesn\'t have a good sword (or sword substitute) as a backup for his
laser gun is a fool. This is sci-fi in the tradition of John Carter of Mars,
Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon and Star Wars.

still experiencing soarness now.  She is very glad she didn\'t have a 
c-section.  The recovery time and hospital stay is much longer than with a 
vaginal birth.  We have talked to many OBGYNs and Pediatricians before and 
after the birth and all of them tell us that intercourse will be normal in 
time (usually 4-6 weeks after the birth-but everyone heals at their own rate) 
and none-said anything about lifetime pain when engaged in intercourse.  Most 
DRs have told us that if it is painful after about 10 wees still then there 
are complications that need to be looked at.

You apparently had a bad experience, or now someone close who has.  You put 
"quotes" around natural when talking about a vaginal birth.  The fact is, it 
is the natural way for babies to be born, not to be taen out of a sedated 
mother with surgery.  I\'m glad that science/medicine has given people that 
option because there are cases that mother and/or child may die.  There has 
been a current trend for mothers who can afford it to have c-sections in 
order to avoid not only pain but also the time and work involved in a natural 
labor.  As this is OT I will not go into details about the problems with this 
fad.  Aside from driving up health care costs, there are other risks 
involved, almost as many as a vaginal delivery.  I don\'t want to take up more 
space on a list like this on this subject, but I did (as a new dad who just 
witnessed the birth process up close) want to put my .2cr in on the comment.  
You kinda put the "painful intercourse" line in there like it happens to 
everyone for the rest of their lives.  I\'m sure you didn\'t mean it that way, 
but it read lie that.   Tae it easy all.

I\'ve realized that Space Opera doesn\'t have a very good definition.  To
some it is highly cinematic, soft science (banking space fighters "Lensmen
type") SF.  To other is simply means that you have things that don\'t exist
in modern society (FTL Travel, psionics, etc.).  Whether Traveller is Space
Opera depends on your definition.

I also think that the new people being brought into the game (and given the
sales that SJG is getting, they have to be bringing in fair number unless
everyone on the list is buying multiple copies :-) are fairly different in
style.  It might be interesting if these people start showing up on the
list in fair numbers.... :-)

I also feel that computer games are just a step on the road to real computer
RPG\'s.

When you have systems available at home like holo-decks ( technically
possible now, but far too expensive and difficult to use )  then the "real"
computer RPG game will exist.

Already, Ultima On-Line has shown that many people aren\'t  interested in
just the hack\'n\'slash part, being more interested in trade and
communication.

At the same time, the rise in LARPs has exposed RPGs to more people. This
very evening I will be attending a build-up/advertising event for a local
game based on the "Aliens" universe which will be covered by the local
media, and is held in a public building, literally just over the road from
the New Zealand parliment buildings.

I tend to feel that RPG\'s as pencil and paper warganes _are_ largely dead or
dying. Other than the wargamers who started them (and I\'ll admit I was one
at the time), most RPG players don\'t care about rule systems, and would
rather they were invisible to play, allowing the roleplaying to occur
without the nuisance of people flipping charts or rolling dice or whatever.

To a large extent I try to run my games this way, and have reached the point
where I usually don\'t even look at the rules, and have even acted as Story
Teller for games without knowing anything about the rules, another person
was  given the title "Ajudicator" and we all turned to him when we needed ru
les decisions. On the other hand, I spend lots of time reading the
background materiel.

For a while, we used to modify all genres that came out to work with our
groups own set of rules,
(largely based on a simplified version of the Daredevils/Aftermath system
from FGU, which at the time was the most generic rules system around other
than Chaosium\'s BRP which has several large holes in it\'s combat system,
this was before GURPS)  because that was easier than trying to get people to
learn new rules when we played a new game.

I have played everything from an Ars Magica type of game to a version of
Traveller using that system.

Here\'s another who feels Traveller is designed for space opera.

Given the characters and books that are supposed to have influenced it\'s
design, I can\'t see how anyone can see it as anything but space opera. Just
look at the characters presented at the back of Supplement 1 : 1001
Characters, Kimball Kinnison, Earl Dumerest, Dominic Flandry, etc.

In our games we have had things like the vampire Queen of the Universe (a
player) riding into battle on her personal war-droid ( another player ).

In the same game, my character, who had once been a promising diplomat, but
had by then been nick-named  "Captain Ahab", spent much of his time trying
to figure out ways of destroying the entire crew of his ship. It had to be
_all_ of them, to prevent the prophecy from coming to pass,  and it had to
be so sudden that they couldn\'t stop it, and I had to prepare for it in such
a way that they didn\'t know I was preparing for it....

And what ever you do, avoid any planet entirely peopled by Australians.
While they are freindly sorts, will crack open a tinny for you on the
slightest pretext, and do great barbaques, after a few days your crew will
start talking like them, leading to uncontrollable outbursts of violence
from those who just can\'t stand the \'strine accent.

Sorry, a bit rambly because I\'m home sick and dosed up on various drugs.

Interesting that the blurb says:
"Star Viking is a game of interstellar raiding and plunder for two players.
Using a unique system of 12 mapboard tiles to represent the various star
systems in the Outrim sector, it captures the tense uncertainty and the
sudden, flashing battles of interstellar war."

The _Outrim_ sector?? Is this in H. Beam Piper\'s original novel, or just
from this game? I\'m interested because Egryn subsector (Trojan Reach) was
called "The Outrim Void" in _Leviathan_!!

Could _Star Viking_ be the source of the appellation?

Yeah; my old group on Long Island in the 80\'s loved FGU\'s Space Opera over 
Traveller for this very reason. I had to be different though....:-), and to

I probably wouldn\'t go as far to say that yet, however I have heard that
the spinal cord does a lot of local processing.

I don\'t buy this idea, however it is good for plot hooks.  We might be able
to find out if this is possible though.  There was a news blurb about a
scientist that has started doing hand transplants on human patients.

There is also a theory that says the underlying connective structure
of cells does a whole lot more than holding cells together.  Some
scientists propose that these structures do a lot of a nuerons\'
processing.  If this is the case, then the every part of the human
body has a very large information processing capability.  If anyone
ever has a successfull brain transplant, or even better a full body
cyborg (ization?) done, we will see the effects first hand.  This will
allow us to make a better determination on the psychological
effects of such a drastic surgery.

There was also the minor race discovered by our intrepid travellers in the
Digest (issue #4? #5?) that were originally thought to be animals.

Not necessarily. I spoke to Steve Jackson at the GAMA convention, and he said 
that they didn\'t include the Traveller cardboard heros with the new release 
because he wasn\'t happy with the artwork. This could be (and remember I\'m

Alot of the handwaves come from the DGP period. The cybernetics handwave is
a striking example. They also played up the role of the Vilani in the
Imperium quite a bit, ostensibly to provide justification for the slow tech
growth of the Imperium in some areas. The Vilani became a distinct race,
with longer lifespans, etc., as opposed to the label being purely cultural.
That\'s what stands out.

All of my DGP info has come second hand from the list, so it may be suspect.
Unfortunately, DGP\'s materials never made it to my local hobby shop.

I am mostly recovered-- no sexual problems anyway, but it\'s been a good 6
years.  I didn\'t have a big perineal tear, thank goodness.

What offended me was your tone saying "perineal tears" and "incontinence"
like these are minor risks.  Some perineal tears are very minor, but others
are not.  Incontinence is severely psychologically damaging-- especially
when you are 28.  I really don\'t think that having your urinary system torn
up is a "minor complication".  Even if it is repaired later.

Because of that, I\'d appreciate it if male doctors didn\'t speak as though
the risks women take were minor, and wishing to avoid incontinence, etc.
were frivolous.

I apologize for my snarky tone, but a man who has never been a
newly-divorced woman in her early 30\'s trying to figure out how to discuss
this damage and its consequences with a new boyfriend should understand that
being the ones who get pregnant is not a wonderful thing for some of us.

And while I have recovered almost completely after 6 years, a very few
unlucky females don\'t.

Good Space Opera usually is performed in it\'s original Klingon. ;) After
seven or eight FTF gaming groups, and what I\'ve heard online, I\'d have to
agree. Some say it is the plot structure being ultra-dramatic, others that
tech sways to accomadate the story. I always thought of Star Wars as more
Space Opera than Traveller, but I can see how the setting could easily allow
for that playstyle. All those nobles, patrol cruisers, and BEM\'s, etc. The
Campaign I was in was none of these, being more of a mystery/conspiracy type
plot. With free-trading to pay the bills. You gotta pay the bills, and merc
work always scares me, isn\'t it bad enough I could die in character
generation? ;)

A lot of Jack L Chalker\'s work is pure space opera.  Just read the \'Four 
Lords of the Diamond\' series, or the \'Run to Chaos Keep\' series.  It\'s \'hard 
sci fi\', but still space opera.

I suspect that depends on where you\'re working, David. When I took my
degree in Electrical Engineering in 1985 (in Saskatchewan) almost all our
reference works were in metric (SI to be more precise). Our professors were
heartily glad to be using SI for thermodynamics, not Imperial, anyway.

No offense taken. I suppose that I should really include the design

True. But verification of proposed official designs is more useful. Given
your comments about GT errors, you should probably be participating in the
Gt Starships playtest.

Another point is that once your design is out in the public domain SJG
probably won\'t use it in their product, which means that the best designs
may be rendered unusable. As more readers probably read the official books
than the TML, your audience is larger if you get in print.

In, definately. Not only does on get one\'s name in print, but you get all
the playtest stuff plus the PD stuff. There\'s also the added attraction of
helping create the official background.

Even limited to this extent, it\'ll completely change commerce. Raw
materials can be extracted from country rock, or re-processed from
trash. BTW, fusion reactors have the potential to do the same.

So you wind up with an economy that bears no resemblance to anything
players are familar with. It\'d resemble some cyberpunk stuff, but it
*wouldn\'t* give us the Imperium. 

As for cybernetics and computer stuff, you have the standard Traveller
problem of explaing why progress has been so *slow*. Hell, we can do
stuff now that I don\'t think *any* version of CT allowed. Or only
allowed at very high TLs.

I used to read the translated versions back in the 70s. I think they
got up into the 200s before sales got too low.

There\'s a *reason* the processor is so dumb. There was exactly *one*
attempt to use a "modern" CPU in a satellite. One of the OSCAR
satellites (satellites built by and for amateur radio operators). 

It was a disaster. In spite of their best efforts to shield it,
radiation was flipping bits in the CPU often enough to make it useless
much of the time. And waht "modern" chip was this? An 8086. 

I\'m not sure what the latest "space rated" CPU is, but at that time it
was the RCA 1802 (same chip used in the *ancient* "ELF" computer
training kits from the 70s).

The requirements for space rated CPUs and parts are so different from
"mainstream" that until we have *major* orbital installations and
thousands of probes out there, they\'ll be either old stuff kept in
production for this "niche" market, or "custom" parts which cost like
crazy. 

Radiation and semiconductors don\'t mix well. And the higher the
integration (ie the smaller the junctions on the chip) the easier it is
for radiation to screw things up.

And for operations near a gas giant, figure that any GG that\'s
relatively close to an active star is going to have radiation belts
like Jupiter\'s *or worse*. 

That means special suits for EVA (something as bulky as BD). And
preferrably *no* EVA.

In really bad radiation belts, they may even have to worry about the
ship\'s hull not being sufficient shielding. But such should be rare.
Still won\'t help them when they encounter it. :-)

This is IMHO the heart of the matter.  Traveller isn\'t cyberpunk, hard-sf,
posthumanist, or any other flavor of SF, except moderately realistic (as
compared to say Lensman) space opera. 

Well, space opera has also changed over the past 20 years.  I think a wise
move would be into incorporate some of the changes. 

Two excellent recent series are the Hellflower trilogy by Eluki bes Shahar
(aka Rosemary Edgehill) & the Exordium Qunitology by Dave Trowbridge and
Sherwood Smith

Both are mid 90s space opera with interstellar nobles, settings vaguely
similar to Traveller, as well as cybernetic implants, limited genetic
engineering, AI computers, and similar stuff. 

Both series kept this reasonable by saying that full AI computers were
*highly* illegal (from problems experienced with them before).  Say all
but *really* limited nanotech to these limits, borrow heavily from both
series and you can get a Traveller Imperium that doesn\'t feel so retro,
but is still the Imperium.

He\'s a conservative columnist.  Imagine someone just a bit to the right

Having said that, I can\'t say that I disagree with Sobran\'s definitions

You should have seen the sweat pour off may face, as I resisted the urge to make
a NZ LARP joke, then you relieve me by writing the above patagraph.

So : Hear Goes......

Alien V : THE LARP

After smashing into the pacific ocean at the end of Alien IV, Ripley\'s and the
Alien dna are scraped off the hull and cloaned. Unfortunatly, they are cloaned
in New Zealand, who never got past the sheep cloaning of the 20th Century, so
now we have Alien Hybrid sheep running around NZ, and its the players job to
capture it.

Featuring the king of Gearheads : Peter Jackson! (with Fusion Lawnmower Man
Portable)
As well as The Best New Zealand Footbaler The South Sea Islands have ever
produced : Jonah Lomu!

Gasp as the killer alien sheep consume the population! (exciting the male
population in the process!). Drool in fright as New Zealand is turned into a
dark desolate wasteland (um it\'s that allready), and watch Sam Neil and Caine
the wonder dog save the day!

One path is that aircraft become better armoured (and slower) to
defend against lasers (and the lasers defend against missiles, so aircraft
cannon become the main weapon...) Ultimately, you end up with flying
tanks.

Sound familiar?

You bet, and with any luck, I\'ll own them.  I would love to use them when I
demo G:Trav at conventions.  (hint hint, no one else bid on it :)

Do you know how out of print those things are?  The Warehouse doesn\'t
exactly have secret copies to sell to every employee who begs for it.
Perhaps they do, but I haven\'t convinced them to sell them to me yet.

Interesting.  I haven\'t heard that.  It doesn\'t suprise me though.

Nope.  It\'s a case of me wanting them because I\'m a sucker for anything
with the word Traveller stamped on it.  Besides, Cardboard Heroes are cool! ;)

SJ Games is still thinking about releasing more Cardboard Heroes.  If they
edecide to do it, then they will crack out the old artwork files, the spare
work copy that never leaves Austin, or hire artists to draw them.


On a side note,

I was at the Berkeley Distributor Open House a few weekends ago, and I got
to talk to quite a few retail people.  Amongst the very postive comments
that they had about GURPS Traveller, and how it is selling, they mentioned
the desire for Traveller Cardboard Heroes to be reprinted and spaceship
deck plans (for your Cardboard Heroes/miniatures) to be released.
Personally, I am all for more Traveller products and I think those are
excellent ideas.  Of course, I am just a web-monkey, so I don\'t have an
real impact on sales or marketing decisions.  Hopefully, I\'ll get a second
set of Trav Cardboard Heroes in the future. :)


On an additional side note, anyone want to sell me Book 8 for less than
$15? :)

This would be the first edition book.

It\'s definately second edition.

Makes perfect sense to me.  Mind you, I met Steve at a Con about 20 years ago 
(one of the Earthcons, in Cleveland), and he struck me as a guy who placed 
quality as a \'good thing\' in his products.

That would be cool.  Course, a set of CH for use with Striker would be cool, 
too...

Come to think of it, so would some cardboard tanks & vehicles...

This would work for me, too.  Especially if I could still use the plans for 
my CT/MT stuff as well.

<imho>
one of the things that would appear to have helped kill war-games was the
anti-war movement in the US (see also the Vietnam "Police Action" aka
undeclared war); wargaming has been linked to officer training since the
1880\'s. The US service acadamies all have wargaming available in the
curriculum. (In fact, the US Army\'s Command and General Staff College
correspondence course includes an extended "Pre-porgramed PBM".

The wargaming industry seems to have been tapering off bvy 1975, and really
dead by about \'80, except as adjucts to roleplaying or history classes;
not-so-serious wargames (Wabbit Wampage, Supremacy) were really trying to
fill the same niche as Monopoly and Risk.. an evening\'s entertainment.

Note that most of those with the finances to afford to buy US$20-$40 boxed
sets in the mid-late 70\'s were likely to be the same people who protested
the war, or had fought and were burned out.

Also there were those of us too young to have remembered the \'Nam except as
an occasional TV story... amongst many of my friends through high school,
it was only those who\'s parets DIDN\'T fight in the \'Nam and didn\'t protest
who were "allowed" to play serious wargames. (In my case, my dad was a
REMF, and an officer, and being medical service corps, he had a somewhat
les than REMF attitude.)

One of the groups I used to game with (SFB & Traveller...) was composed of
2 ex-marines, one ex-navy and one ex-army nam vets, and myself, a child
born during the war. They wouldn\'t play anything that was close to the Nam
in tone, and didn\'t even like to do ground combat simulatiojns, but blowing
starships up was great fun. I did some SFB playtest stuff with them;
getting them to playtest the ground-combat boardgame was like pulling
teeth... it took whiskey as an anesthetic.

- -> CT sold me on the setting, but not the rules.
- -> MT sold me on the rules, but not quite on the rebellion setting.
- -> TNE failed all my tests for desireablity...

The background is great (at least, AFAIC) up through 1115. I like the
1115-1128 stuff well enough to use it, but it doesn\'t logically track all
that well when compared to either CT or MT rules materials (vs background
materials). To me, Traveller always was and ever shall be the 3rd imperium,
MT, and the weave of Zhodani, Aslan, Vargr, Newt, Virush, and Domain of
Denebers , and the ever present and powerfull nobility that I was
introduced to prior to anyone in the group actually possessing a set of the
rules (including the GM! Eiditic Memory on his part allowed for him to
"steal" the materials without removing them from the store physically; what
players needed, he copied down by hand, including his house rules).

Really, that blend is missing in TNE; the setting there is almost (but not
quite) a different entity.

Hmm.. DGP\'s TD had some cybernetics rules for MT, as did TNE\'s FF&S1 for
TNE. Limited, yes.Nothing Ubermenschenish. I used them in play, with no
problems.

Biotech and Nanotech, in any sane society, will be carefully controlled; an
accident could be catastrophic. The US government is starting to get
paranoid about biotech and nanotech already. There have been several moves
to outlaw biotech research involving the human genome; AFAIK, very little
has been passed.

Also, no one knows just how far current trends in technology will continue.
Many existing technologies are still 10 years from common adoption; cost,
social factors, and environmental issues prevent implementation in many
cases (forex: Gallium Arsenide chips (environmental), <0.2 micron masking
techniques for semiconductors (cost), RISC based computing in the WinTel
world (social, due to the Microsoft near-monoply and not supporting moves
to non-x86 architechtures, which are incremental evolutions of a 1970\'s
base architechture)). Somehow, I doubt we\'ll actually hit vingean
singularity before we have off-world populations.

Additionally, it would tend to preclude any non-isolationist communities
below the prevailing TL, due to being able to rapidly extract the resources
for infrastructure imporvements. A few off-worlders coming in and putting
in the needed hardware to upgrade the locals to just below prevailing tech,
and then running it as a company store situation, could concieveably get
enough popular support (provided the ompany store is bening on food and
luxury items, but really hard on infrastructural goods) to make a go.

BTW it worked - "Harumph. Why, yes-I\'d-buy-them".  ;-)

Now you just need to ask us for the type, quantity, quality and format we\'d
be willing to purchase!

Here\'s a start:
     A PC\'s pack, similar to the original
     An Aliens pack, featuring Aslan, Droyne, Hivers, K\'kree, Vargr,
Virushi
     A military pack, featuring Marines, Army, Navy, Scouts, Zho\'s in
combat armour
     Ship deckplans (already mentioned) in a nice large-size publication
     Blank deckplan tiles AND
     Ship "items" for use on blank deckplan tiles, such as chairs,
consoles, \'freshers, beds, tables, etc.

OK, folks, all yours to add to!

(BTW, Keith, did SJG take note of our earlier poll about marketable items -
eg caps with Imperial insignia, etc?? Loren, hello?)

For the record, now that I am writing GT: Starships I am deliberately not
reading any TML posts on component or starship design. I don\'t want to
unconsciously plagiarize something.  On the other hand, there are only so
many approaches to most components so the solutions are bound to look
similar.

I agree: I would much rather fix the sourcebook before it comes out. The
only way I can accept those comments is through the official playtest
process.

I can\'t use *anything* that isn\'t submitted directly to me, for copyright
reasons. Anyone who is interested in submitting needs to read the
disclaimers on my website:

<http://www.io.com/~thrash/starship.html>

It\'s not quite as bad as Rob suggests -- I have been able to ignore the
TML being "public domain", for example -- but SJ Games would clearly
prefer all submissions be created specifically for them.

The compilor\'s view is that this sourcebook is supposed to be a
collaboration. If you don\'t care to help, that\'s okay, but don\'t complain
too much about it afterward.

I am only initiated into the third circle of employment.  My Zelator

Well, I would guess that whatever format it came out in, it would probably
have hex-grids.  It\'s what GURPS has used since day one, and the G:Trav
deckplans currently written up are in hex format as well.  Of course, it\'s
pretty difficult to talk about the format of a product that might never see
the light of day. :)

I think what is being overlooked here is a very *basic* principle.
Alas, it tends to be overlooked a lot, not just in gaming. 

"You can\'t change just *one* thing."

To put it another way, everything interrelates. And changing *anything*
has *some* effect on everything else. 

All too often, these side effects get overlooked. Until some bright
player points out a logical consequence of the change and the GM has to
scramble to patch the hole. And often the patch has side effects of its
own. Pretty soon you\'ve got this ugly mess of patches upon patches. 

That\'s why you have to think things thru. And be aware *in advance* of
the holes a change can put in the background.

Considering the product would be cheep to produce and make a decent buck in sales, I couldn\'t see why they wouldn\'t go for it.

Yep.

Though this won\'t happen to miltary spacecraft. Remote control isn\'t
practical above a few thousand km seperataton between controller and

Actually, the original definition was fairly clear. It included the
Lensman series, the Skylark series, Campbell\'s later Arcot, Morey &
Wade stories, etc.

Basicly you had to have "grand sweep" (ie worrying about whole
civilizations, not mere worlds), larger than life characters, and
ususally escalating superweapon vs superweapon duels between the good
guys and the bad guys. 

Star Wars is the only *modern* Space Opera I can think of.

I\'m reminded of a reviewer\'s comments about a collection of Ron
Goulart\'s "Chameleon Corps" stories. "People, animals, even plants, I\'m
willing to give him. But when he starts turning into *furniture*,
that\'s going too far!"

Frankly, any remotely realistic ameboid has to be restrict to roughly
the same volume (+/- maybe 25%). And they shouldn\'t be able to change
*mass* at all. 

Odo routinely violates the hell out of these limits, as do many other
shapeshifters. And all I can say is "Sorry, you *have* to follow those
rules or be using magic."

Actually, you should look into what used to be called "slime molds".
These are organisms consisting of multiple cells, except the cell
bodies don\'t have a cell membrane. Instead, the nuclei share a common
pool of protoplasm. 

Slime molds are capable of motion, and rather blur the boundary between
single celled and multi-celled organisms. They share a single "cell
body", but have multiple nuclei. And they get quite large. I\'m pretty
sure they can get up to an ounce or so (30+ grams). 

Give them the right sort of environment, and a lack of predators (which
is likely the major limit on their growth currently), and they might
eventually evolve into something like Odo.

Even if they don\'t, a slime mold that massed many kilos would be scary
enough even if it wasn\'t any brighter than a bug. Step in this "puddle"
and the slime swarms up your legs and starts digesting you even before
it finishes enveloping you. Add the ability to secrete some sort of
numbing or paralyzing agent (maybe both) and you\'ve got a nasty.

Which reminds me of an interesting organism from one of Schmitz\'s
Telzey Amberdon stories. It immobilizes it\'s prey and slowly consumes
it. It turns out the organism has a minor psi sense, which enables it
to know what parts can be eliminated, how to "simplify" the prey as it
eats (ie seal off the blood vessels to sections it is eating). 

It\'s a nasty because it sees no reason to turn off the brain of the
critter, nor to introduce any sort of pain killers. It does prevent the
prey from going into shock. 

In the story, someone "fed" an enemy to one of these critters as
revenge for something.

On the other hand, it\'d take a major miracle level breakthrough to get
people to another star before we hit the Singularity. Or a *major*
disaster to hold back advances, but not the ability of people to spread

For the same power level, masers will be *way* larger than lasers. Due
solely to *wavelength* considerations. 

And microwaves are easier to deflect.

	The thrust and mass flow can be calculated from the above 
	values:

	Exhaust velocity (v) = 13 000 m/s
	Input power (P) = 80 W
	Thrust (F) = 2P/v = 0.012308 = 12 mN
	Mass flow (mf) = 2P/v^2 = 9.46746E-07 kg/s = 0.947 mg/s
	Specific Impulse (ISP) = 9.81*F/mf = 127 530 s

	Using the same values, a large-scale thruster would be:

	Thrust: 1 kN
	Power: 6.5 MW
	Fuel consumption: 0.076923077 kg/s (277 kg/hr)
	Fuel type: suitable expellant material (helium, nitrogen, water, etc)

	I shoud have written:

	Specific Impulse (ISP) = F/(mf*9.81) = v/9.81 = 1325 s

	The ISP values for other thruster types are:

	Chemical                150-450 
	NTR (Nuclear Thermal)   825-925

	The microwave thruster appears to be little better than arcjet.

I can\'t see that Traveller is anything but Space Opera.  Easy FTL travel,
psionics, antigravity, huge space battles, aliens who look like cat people
and dog people (and cool as they may be, Aslan are cat/lion people), &
vast interstellar empires are all traditional marks of Space Opera. 

Space Opera ranges from the wacky end like Star Wars & Lensman to more
realistic material like Trowbridge & Smith\'s Exordium quintology, but it
has a definite feel and definite conventions and Traveller is a typical
example of the more realistic end of space opera. 

With very few exceptions, *all* space-related RPGs are space opera. Hard
SF games don\'t sell terribly well (2300 & Blue Planet are the only major
examples around).  The only non-Space Opera SF games involving space
travel (as opposed to cyberpunk or other types of SF) are the newer space
anime genre, represented primarily by DP 9s excellent game "Jovian
Chronicles".

You\'re a lot more optimistic about space settlements than I am. Given the
state of current technology, I\'m betting on us really ramping up to the
singularity in the 2050-2060 range.  I\'d be shocked if there were more
than (at most) 10,000 people living off-world then.  A more reasonable
estimate is likely to be between several dozen and several 100.  Our
electronic and biological tech is vastly outdistancing our rocketry tech. 
Direct neural interfaces are already in their early infancy (moving a
cursor by neural control & decoding a cat\'s visual signals), but we\'re
still using chemical rockets for 95% of space applications. 

With new electronic & biotech advances coming daily, and few changes in
space tech since the late 70s I\'m betting the singularity comes a long
time before we seriously get into space. Then again, space travel sounds
like it would more fun for post-human beings.  I\'m sure hoping I live to 
become some weird post-human thing :)

Of course, any breakthroughs on anti-gravity, fusion drives or other
cheap-n-easy ways to orbit will likely change my predictions dramatically.

Training and experience are, of course, good things - and of course that\'s
the real advantage of the long service regular army.  

East Timor is a good reminder of what the Australian and New Zealand armies
are:  cadre forces.  Unlike the US, neither of these armies are really
meant to engage in large scale combat without either allies, or, more
importantly for Traveller purposes, a period of mobilisation - that is,
expansion to a much greater size.

This is relevant to the original point of "small, regular" armies - the
Australian and NZ forces aren\'t "really" meant to be such, but rather are
intended to be a nucleus for a (slightly) larger, short service force,
whether mobilised reservists, newly enlisted volunteers, conscripts, or a
mixture.  In fact, in World War II, Australia used a mixture.  In Korea,
there seems to have been a specially recruited volunteer force - a
temporary expansion of the regular forces, and in Vietnam, conscripts were
used.  Apparently, at least some Reservists are being *asked* to go on
full-time to help with the manpower problems associated with the tiny East
Timor deployment.

Of course, the regular cadre force can, and does, deal with small
deployments, which is primarily what the Australian forces have been doing
in recent decades, so the cadre form is actually the normal one in which
such an army will exist.

OBTRAV:  Mobilisation strategies seem to be very important in shaping
military organisations.  

The Imperium has to maintain a relatively large standing military force,
and, in fact is fairly permanently at war along the Vargr frontier, among
other places.  At the same time, it clearly doesn\'t usually need the huge
forces it requires in something like a Frontier War.   Further, it contains
subordinate governments, that control their own military forces.

This, of course, results in the canonical use of Colonial forces, as well
as such practices as mobilising former scouts, and the temporary absorption
of scout service assets into the Navy.

Anyway, Doug, and whoever does the Navy book, will need to look at the
differences between peacetime and wartime establishments, and the
mobilisation (and demobilisation!) strategies used to change between the
two.

Recent news in Australia suggests it is more the doctors choice, lessening
the risk of law suits as "natural birth" is still much the fav for the
majority of Aussie women... I cannot speak for other countries however.

I started building a WWII army (actually, both a German and
British/Commonwealth army) in 1/72nd scale, had 1000\'s of hand painted
troopies and was working on a decent collection of vehicles before I
realised that the cost was becoming greatly unrealistic.  When I originally
paid $0.85 (Aust) per vehicle for say a Sherman or Tiger tank, and $2.75 for
a gun and tractor combination which over the course of 5-years rose by
300-400% in cost, that was me out!

Lead miniatures went similar ways for massed armies I have seen in war game
clubs, being replaced by plastic only to become out-priced again.  I play
computer games (I played the old SSI titles on the C64 originally) because
they are "cheaper" than miniatures and easier to set up as well as being
"pre-painted"... but most because of the cost.  My wife has nothing against
me buying miniatures, but I don\'t see the value compared to what the money
could buy the family (I have 4x children too), but 90%+ of the war gamers I
know who are married -- I know it was their *wives* that put a stop to them.

Thus the requirement for patients to become well-informed about their
conditions and their treatments. A doctor making medical decisions
based on tee times, IMO, deserves to be used for medical experiments.

My first child was born while our obstetrician was vacationing in the
Caribbean. His backup was tied up with another birth when my wife
delivered, an intern did a fine job helping with the delivery. Then the
Obstetrician popped her head in the door, asked if everything was OK,
and added her fee to the hospital\'s bill...

The hospital where my other two kids have been born was, IMO, a good
deal better. The care was mostly midwives who seemed to know
what they were doing, including how to talk to new parents. 
Their literature was interesting, I recall a line from it:
"Though you will be under the supervision of medical professionals,
Pregnancy is not a medical condition..."

ObTrav: I\'ll bet that, no matter how high the technology, good and bad
people will continue to make a big difference.

	This is an excellent scenerio for the evolution of a
	multi-unit organism, but you should add in a good
	reason that the super-organism remains unspecialized
	in form.  Perhaps it evolves underground, in passages
	and caverns where being large and reducing surface
	area are important, but being able to squeeze through
	small openings is crucial.  That\'s week, but maybe the 
	local environment changes drastically and often, so
	that extreme flexibility is crucial.

>Hmm, what about reproduction?  Essentially, one queen would

	And the new queen might take some of the "workers" and
	part of the exterior membrane with her, so that the
	superorganism splits just like an amoeba.

>Well, I said the idea was bizarre, didn\'t I? :-)  I\'d really

>outlandish?  Are there major problems I haven\'t thought of?

	The biggest problems would be to get food and air to
	all parts of the organism, remove wastes from same, and
	compete with specialized organisms while remaining a
	large, relatively unspecialized mass.  Nevertheless,
	such an organism is no more inconceivable than some
	other aspects of Traveller.  I designed a Traveller
	T2-like robot, made up of subunits ranging in size from
	(relatively) simple nanites up to energy cell units
	5 cm across.  A biological version might also have been
	designed.  How about you post your creature when you 
	get it done?

	Strictly speaking, "grey matter" is just neuron (nerve

	by complex systems of neurons connecting to each other
	by axons, but just because there are nerve cell bodies

	a series of various "beeps" and forwarding a regular
	"beep" on to the central nervous system).  It would be
	missleading to most people to call such cells "grey
	matter," nor such processing "intelligence."  There are
	ganglia (small bodies of grey matter that process data
	from various sources) found in our bodies (mostly near
	the spine), and both the ganglia and the spine are
	involved in such involuntary reactions as the "knee-jerk"
	reflex.

IIRC, "Through The Eye Of The Needle" by Hal Clement  features  an
amorphous symbiotic alien (amorphous alien living inside a human).

I tried using it in my  TU  many  years  ago  and  ended  up  with
something not unlike the life form from the Demon planet  in  Star
Trek: Voyager (another amorphous alien).

I have heard that  some  complex  coordination  skills  (such  as
playing the piano) may be performed (at least partially)  in  the
spinal cord rather the brain.  This being so would the  recipient
of a spinal cord  transplant  from  a  concert  pianist  gain  an
aptiude for piano playing?

No, that just requires _better_ unmanned aircraft.  You don\'t want direct remote-piloted vehicles anyway, you want semi-autonomous drones which are given mission requirements by a remote controller, and that works reasonably well from several AU (witness planetary probes).  Otherwise its way to easy to take them out with a jammer.

The following is from Brian Aldiss\'s intro to his anthology "Space Opera", and
also provides the extract used on the sleeve.

"Science fiction is a big muscular horny creature, with a mass of bristling
antennae and proprioceptors on its skull. It has a small sister, a gentle
creature with red lips and a dash of stardust in her hair. Her name is Space
Opera. This volume is dedicated to her ..."

"Science fiction is for real. Space opera is for fun. Generally."

"What space opera does is take a few light years and a pinch of reality and
inflate thoroughly with melodrama, dreams, and a seasoning of screwy ideas
..."

"I resist the impulse here to define space opera ... The term is both vague and
inspired, and must have been coined with both affection and some scorn,
analogously with soap opera and horse opera. And, analogously, with opera
itself, space opera has certain conventions which are essential to it, which
are, in a way, its raison d\'etre; one may either like or dislike those
conventions, but they cannot be altered except at expense to the whole.
Ideally, the Earth must be in peril, there must be a quest and a man to match
the mighty hour. That man must confront aliens and exotic creatures. Space must
flow past the ports like wine from a pitcher. Blood must run down the palace
steps and ships launch out into the louring dark. There must be a woman fairer
than the skies and a villain darker than a Black Hole. And all must come right
in the end."

My take:

Hard science fiction isn\'t the only science fiction. There is science fiction
that puts the science before the fiction, and science fiction that places an
emphasis on the fiction above the science (eg CJ Cherryh, PK Dick, IM Banks,
Fred Pohl, numerous others). All I ask of science fiction is that whatever
ideas are developed have an internal consistency, and a believability within
that consistent context. I think Traveller has at its best striven for that
consistency. On the other hand, it contains numerous space opera tropes (for
example, the blood on the palace steps springs to mind). 

In the end you can play it either way. I think if you get to the position where
the players can, say, get involved in the assassination of Strephon and either
throw themselves in front of the death ray, or chase down the assassin - ie
where they move at the core of melodramatic events - you\'ve got space opera.
But I think most people play it as science fiction, against a backdrop of
stars, to steal the title of one of Andy Slack\'s fine articles.

PS: If you get Aldiss\'s book, read the Sheckley story - now that\'s space opera.

Then you want more than a cramped seat for the pilot. Look at pilot fatigue

consider using two roomy seats that fold up into a bunk and installing a small
galley (p77 Bunks & Short Occupancy Vehicles)

Limited life support only occupies 2 cubic feet including atmosphere scrubbers,
air-con/heaters & stuff. Not enough room for a toilet. Waste disposal is
included in quarters (p76). So I guess the crew have to bring their own buckets

Old gamer, new to this list..

Ok, I admit it, I\'m stoopit, but.. To make a short story shorter, I sold all 
my CT books about 10 years ago, when I got married and we tried to cram two 
households into one flat. Please keep smirks in the docking area and I\'ve 
already branded myself a heretic, ok? ;-)

Anyway, since we now have larger space, and the storage in comps have 
increased, I, just for fun, have started to restore old notes, my old 
character and the subsector I developed (Subsector B/Hlakhoi. I\'ve renamed 
it to align with the data I\'ve found online.)
But.. My cherished Aliens 1: Aslan is gone.. I\'ve got the data but has lost 
the key to Aslan governement types..
So I gathered this is the place to ask..

Does anyone have the key to Aslan government types (or rather G-N) or could 
point me in a direction where I can find it, book or otherwise?

I would be most grateful. There is no need to address the entire list, if 
this has been asked before, just mail me at shallager@hotmail.com

Also, take the Intrepid grav tank with a front DR of 25,000. It would take a 
475mm HEAT shell (gun) or huge 238mm HEAT warhead (missile) to penetrate 
that DR roughly half the time. So, given a high enough DR, laminate armor is 
really just more cost for little extra benefit.

That was the other reason.  HVKKs are more of a problem.

An upgrade to \'expensive laminate\' on the Intrepid would increase cost from $15.6M to $18.6M (advanced metal is not available).

A change to \'standard laminate\' on the Intrepid would reduce cost to $12.8M and it winds up with F6/18,000, O4/6,000.  Given the reduction in its primary gun due to the changes in huge energy weapon stats, this would at least mean it can penetrate its frontal armor by hotshotting its main gun, which otherwise it can\'t do.

Wow.  I just realized that being a SJ Games employee gets me around the
whole copyright issue.

Heh.  Actually, beyond forwarding comments that I hear from SJ Games
customers, I don\'t do anything when it comes to sales and marketing.  That
is, if you don\'t look at my work on the SJ Games website as marketing.


>(BTW, Keith, did SJG take note of our earlier poll about marketable items -

If I see anything interesting, I forward it on to the powers that be.  One
of the things I have forwarded is the marketable items thread.

Doing stuff like this is not why I am part of this mailing list, but it
makes a nice justification for spending my work hours reading the TML. ;)

Everything I write in a futuristic setting, every Traveller and Star Trek
RPG system game I ever ran, and every Traveller campaign that I have ever
been in, met this definition.  Hell, that\'s what gearheads DID in most of
our games-- built superweapons/superships/super gear so that we COULD be
larger than life.  And why do Marines carry cutlasses if this is not space
opera?  Pirates- space opera.  Your pets walking upright and shooting at
you-- space opera.  Enemies in trubans with psi powers-- space opera.  The
first drawing I ever saw of a Zhodani looked exactly like Ming the
Merciless to my 16-year-old eyes.

watched media shots of Vietnam on the news.

Then, perhaps it was important to be pro- or anti- war.  Now,
generations X and Y never *had* to think about fighting a ground
war.  Not much anyway.  I don\'t know if this is because we look at
war differently, or because we haven\'t joined a big one, or because
the media changed its mind on how to portray them.

I know this isn\'t the whole reason for RPGs decline in popularity,
but I do think it\'s an indicator... culture shifts around...

In fact, someone mentioned cards.  My grandfather and all his
friends played dominoes, because playing cards was seen as
the mark of the wicked or foolish.  But I think now it\'s not so
strict there, and folks in general assume the cards do not have
a bad influence on character.

Now, how to cast Traveller as a story to be told?  Isn\'t that
the lasting strength of Traveller: a history that can be retold
to others to excite their imagination?  So there is where the
real power in Traveller lies, eh?

Cheap and successful are relative terms.  Especially if you are the person
spending the money for the print run. ;)

While I am a dedicated Traveller fan who would definately buy them,
printing them is no guarantee that they will sell.  Heck, without
miniatures it might be a stupid idea to release them now.  There really
isn\'t much out there for Traveller miniatures right now, and the Cardboard
Heroes for Traveller isn\'t a sure thing, set in stone, or even in the
production queue.

My *personal* opinion is that releasing a set of deck plans for several
common ships and simultaneously releasing a large amount of Cardboard
Heroes for Traveller (similar to the Cardboard Heroes reprint) would be the
best way to do it.  Of course, that is just my opinion, and the company
might choose to do something that is more of a sure thing.

So then, nanotech need not destroy Traveller\'s economy.
I say again: set bounds on it!

Now, set some serious bounds on it:

* Nanots are produced in an expensive, specialized factory
(which only produces one type of nanot)
* Nanots are simple; that\'s what makes them affordable, but then
* Nanots are one-function only
(Nanots do not reproduce: that would be their one-function!)
* Nanots have a half-life

Make them expensive and limited.  If you want, make them critical
for a technology and you\'ve got the makings of an interstellar
collapse.

Thank you, Alan.
You CAN allow interested players to have nanotech without upsetting the
economics.  Set bounds!

Holy Crap!!!  That\'s horrible.

The information under Short/Long term occupancy is vague.  Short 
Term is a few hours.  Long Term is Days ... plural.  What about the 
time in the middle?

This would make sense in light of the information on waste disposal. 
At least a bunk includes the volume for a toilet.
 
Also, what are we to do with the Ship\'s Boat?  It carries 96 (more if 
outfitted as such) passengers for up to 24 hours!  Where are they 
gonna do their business?

Perhaps you should redesign those vessels and submit them to 
Chris for inclusion in Starships (or SJG for erratatizing).

I would think the Imperial government would set strict policies and
guidelines in the useage of nanotech.  Defenetitally it would be a capital
offense to make reproducing nanites.  As to their having a hal-life, yes
that seems very logical too.

Hey, that was a compliment. I\'m sure you didn\'t mean it, but I\'ll take it anyway

So Gurps modules, designed using Gurps rules, in the public domain cannot be

What about stuff on web sites? TML Gearheads have got an awful lot of GT designs

Short term, but use roomier seats.  Roomy seats are acceptable for a full day; normal seats are tolerable for a day, if uncomfortable.  Unclear how you add toilets and sinks to short-term occupancy vehicles, I think it\'s assumed as part of access space for large vehicles.

	It is probably more useful to refer to the "central

	I am a little rusty, but the apart from the well-known

No, wrong attitude; banning things in that way just leads to trouble.  Just say that long-term (i.e. stable over multiple reproductions) self-reproducing nanites are not viable with imperial technology.  This isn\'t really an unreasonable assumption, most fictional (or even quasi-fictional, such as most of the more optimistic \'science\' writers) nanotech commits severe violations of thermodynamics, because it never explain where the power to operate the nanites comes from.

	My copy of SMAD* is at work, but it lists some. The only one I
recall off the top of my head is the Rad6000--a rad-hardened, space
rated version of IBM\'s R/6000 processor; 32-bit running at (IIRC)
33MHz. I know there are several other 32-bit CPUs currently being
offered or in works (even rumors of somebody trying to port the
Pentium to a more resistant technology).

*everything* you need to know for spacecraft design; helpful for a

I noticed you didn\'t say it would be more fun. Are you feeling stressed?

It would be both a financial and time penalty for me to help. I can live with
the additional phone charges for online time but I don\'t think I can commit any
more time to my hobbies than I do already. Something would have to give -
probably the TML. Hmm, I probably need a break from it anyway.

I\'ve gotten a number of interesting reading suggestions and examples of
amorphous sorts of creatures from people.  While I would like to follow up
on these eventually, I was wondering if folks could fill me in on the
principles behind these examples in the mean time.  Forex, what is the
stated evolutionary history of the amorphous types in _Rocheworld_, _The
Green Brain_ and so on?  What is the mechanism behind their
shape-changing? Is much detail given in these novels? 


Now for some other replies:

        This is an excellent scenerio for the evolution of a
        multi-unit organism, but you should add in a good

        reason that the super-organism remains unspecialized

</Peez>

Ya, that\'s one thing I thought would be difficult to come up with.  For
starters why does this hive insect become integrated?  What is the
evolutionary benefit?  And once it has done so, why does it not specialize
into something more like a "normal" creature?  Thanks for the suggestion,
I know I haven\'t been able to come up with anything better.

<Peez>
        The biggest problems would be to get food and air to
        all parts of the organism, remove wastes from same, and
</Peez>

This might be accomplished by a sort of migration of the cell masses,
which hold enough "supplies" to last for a migration cycle or two.  They
would also store their wastes until they reached the outer covering,
discarding them once there.  Or they could hand them over to the queen for
more central disposal. 

Alternatively, one could postulate a form of non-centralized
specialization.  There would be cell masses whose job it was to transport
wastes and others which would transport food (these two could be the same
maybe, going back and forth).  The only difference between this and the
sort of specialization we have is that there is no structural segregation
of the different types of cell masses.  They\'re all distributed more or
less evenly throughout the creature.

        such an organism is no more inconceivable than some

I could see this creature being similar, with some relatively large cell
masses for particular purposes.

        get it done?

Sure, dunno when that will be though...

Hoo hoo!  I _like_ this idea.  I might just lift it! :-)

<Bruce>
This had implications for language, and in fact the duscussion started as
a discussion of a race that used color as their language.

I guess their language would be much more oriented towards gradual shifts
as opposed to black-or-white dicrete thinking.  However, there might still
be some of this left in the queen from my example, since she\'s originally
a discrete multi-limbed creature.  

Hey, how much evidence is there that our thing for 10 is a result of our
10 digits?  I\'ve heard this before and it makes a kind of intuitive sense,
but is there anything more to the idea than that?

Some assistance please from the gearheads and scientific types out there.
And another question about a certain piece of Excel Software.

First:

This past weekend, the players in the gaming group decided to board a
ship.  The racial make-up of the boarded ship is immaterial at this point,
so here goes.

How long would the destruct sequence need to be set for a starship with
size "X" engineering and an escaping crew\'s manuver drive "Y" ??

Since the ship in question had a CT Jump 2, Power Plant 2  with 600dT, and 
the escaping crew was in a launch with a 1g Manuver drive, I gave the 
boarders 15 minutes to figure out what to do.  I actually gave them the
15 minutes, this time was used to view schematics out of the
Starship Operators\' Guide and some other I had drawn up.

I assume that the deciding factor would be how far the escaping crew would
need to be based upon the Power Plant size.

Second:

Somewhere out there in the past three years, I down loaded an Excel
spreadsheet
that had all of the "canon" sectors listed.  I now am having trouble using
this
because I have been transferring between two computers and one has Excel 95
and the other Excel 97.  Guess which one has the spreadsheet saved    :-(
Needless to say. I\'m looking for the owner/developer of said spreadsheet
so I may download it to the Excel 95 machine.

Thanks for you assistance.

No, it\'s probably mostly based on how much warning time the designers wanted to put into the ship, and what sort of scuttling charge the designers used.

Civilian power plants won\'t _have_ a destruct sequence, making the issue irrelevant.  Military ships may well have scuttling charges, but they will probably be extremely low power -- set them off and the ship will abruptly lose all power and start decompressing (and be completely unstartable, and probably require months of work in a shipyard to repair), but it won\'t be destroyed, and personell on board will probably be ok if they\'re in pressure suits.  A few ships might have an actual self-destruct charge, which would be a tactical nuclear device, probably in the kiloton range for the ship above.

In any case, the time required to reach a safe distance at 1 G is 20-30 seconds.  The primary reason for a large builtin delay is to give plenty of room for dealing with problems in the event that someone fucks up.  Note that scuttling charges will be detonated _before_ the crew evacuates.

TS 4 is a nice program. I played with a free copy of TS 1 or 2 before going

but I\'ve also been looking at the Star Wars sites with envy! Jesse\'s talked
about it a number of times too! Maybe it\'s time to do something about it!.

One of the problems is cross compatability. I can work with several formats
right now, DXF, obj, b3d, as well ae the native rds format. I know TS uses
cob format and can import several others. What\'s the concensious out
there?What would be the most usable format?

That is one definition.  Traveller has a few techs that stretch current
understanding (FTL, graviticis, psionics) but mostly follows "hard"
science.  It has aliens (and this alone is sometimes enough to take
things as Space Opera) but they are fairly realistically done (the
Aslan are fairly well modelled on something that migh descend from
a generic pouncer/carnivore, the cat/lion thing is as much humans
reading their own experience into it than anything else).  If you
compare to Lensman, it isn\'t even close.  If you compare to Terradyne,
then it is way out there.  In the end it depends on your definition.

Like I say, that is _one_ definition.  I have come to realize that

Banks\' Culture stories are pretty much Space Opera written by a "real"

starts to become something else.

Well, the GURPS: Traveller book would be a good place to start..  Timeline,
nutshell descripsions of most major events, persoanlities, etc.

http://www.prairienet.org/~dmckinne/timeline.html

This is the Traveller Integrated Timeline, an exhaustive listing of every
event ever chronicled in the offcial Traveller universe.  It does list the
death of Strephon, and acts of the Rebellion through 1121.

But, there are programs like CrossRoads (on Windows) and Imagery on the

doing it.

Well, not always. We\'re dealing with a constructed game universe here where
nobody but the most devoted fans have access to even a portion of canonical
information. When you get right down to it, if somebody were inclined to say
that psionic powers are absurd in and eliminate them entirely from their own
Traveller universe, it doesn\'t matter that it invalidates the Empress Wave
of the TNE universe.

So then, with a modicum of thought, psionics could well be excised from
somebody\'s Traveller universe with very few side effects, nasty or
otherwise. The Zhodani could then be changed from an interstellar
civilization that uses psionics to an interstellar power that has certain
"deep structures" that are fundamentally at odds with the Imperium. The
Psionic Suppressions could be eliminated as well. If you\'re really hardcore,
and you happen to know that SuSAG built its fortune on psi-drugs, than you
could easily come up with another reason for their vast wealth: life
extension technologies, extremely forward thinking management, a lucky
break... whatever.

Now, before anyone jumps down my throat, I\'m not advocating eliminating
psionics. This portion of the thread started when Craig Berry said "You
can\'t use the canon background without psionics, as the Zhodani are key to
that background." My response was that it was possible, as large swaths of
the Third Imperium background do not depend in any way on the Zhodani.

In fact, the very concept of the Zhodani could be removed, for all intents
and purposes, if you\'re playing a Reformation Coalition campaign, or a
campaign in Daibei, or a campaign in the Solomani Rim.

This happens *much* more frequently in reverse, at least in canon. When it
became apparent that bio-technology was going to become increasingly
important in the near future it was simply blamed on the Vilani\'s lack of
understanding of the bio-chemistry of their own world. This concept raises
several important issues, the most pressing of which is the fact that the
Solomani are much more advanced in this area than the Third Imperium. Other
races, such as the Aslan, the K\'Kree and the Hivers don\'t have this problem,
nor do the Zhodani. So it would seem that this very lack of general
knowledge in the Imperium leaves a gaping hole. Why aren\'t other
interstellar civilizations who are hostile to the Imperium using this?
Personally, I would think that in the rush to catch up with other
interstellar civilizations that the Imperium could very well place more
emphasis on bio-technology because they are so weak in this area.

In other words, it could be argued that the very patch itself could have the
direct opposite effect that it was intended to. In my own experience, this
tends to happen more frequently in canon than the scenario that you
envision.

>And often the patch has side effects of its
>own. Pretty soon you\'ve got this ugly mess of patches upon patches.


Yep. Which is the way that I see the very setting of the Third Imperium as
it stands. before anybody gets all worked up over this statement, keep
reading.

>That\'s why you have to think things thru. And be aware *in advance* of
>the holes a change can put in the background.


It\'s much, much more important to understand *why* a canon exists in the
first place, to understand what the purpose of that canon is. For example,
in the U.S., there is a canon of high-school literature. This canon exists
so that there is a degree of common ground between students, and that
institutions of higher learning can know what the majority of their students
will have been exposed to previously. That is the real meat of the agenda of
high-school canon. There are various sub-agendas that various groups will
attempt to impose and some even succeed from time. But the purpose remains
the same.

The question then isn\'t about what you can change, and what effects it will
have, but about why you are changing it, or why you do not want it changed,
which is how this discussion was started in the first place.

Quite some time ago, in a similar discussion, someone (I think it was Hans)
stated his position bluntly and clearly: He didn\'t want changes in canon
because he didn\'t want any part of his Traveller collection to be
invalidated. Fair enough. Besides my already voiced opposition to this
statement, I have no complaints. It\'s honest, it\'s straightforward, and it
makes perfect sense. He wanted to be able to use as much new Traveller
material as possible with as little work as possible. It\'s completely
understandable.

I must admit, Leonard, that your position on the matter has always baffled
me a bit, simply because it always comes down to the "player / GM" scenario.
It goes without saying that sometimes GMs are going to make mistakes in
doing things in their own universe that could have amazingly detrimental
effects on the rest of his campaign.

My question is: So what, exactly? This is not something that is in any way
specific to Traveller, and is a problem that crops up in all roleplaying
games. There will always be that point in a DM\'s early dungeon crawl where a
player will say "Hey, what did that carrion crawler that was locked into
that room back there eat, anyway?"

That\'s exactly how lots of the things that are accepted, or partially
accepted as canonical actually became canonical in the first place. "The
Vilani are conservative, that\'s why the Third Imperium seems so
technologically backwards" is simply, "The kobolds forced that carrion
crawler in that room and locked the door because it was eating them" on a
larger scale.

The real problem is that your criterion for canonical information is that
it\'s a criterion that rules out chunks of canonical information that are
already accepted. In this case, your defense could be just as damaging to
what you\'re defending as the opposing argument.

Canon was never static, and it\'s not static right now. If you start at
Classic Traveller and work your way forward, you\'ll see very distinct
periods of growth where certain ideas, concepts and bits of history change,
and sometimes drastically.

Early on, the influence of the Vilani as a cultural group was downplayed. In
the MegaTraveller era the Vilani became a much more distinct and powerful
influence on the Imperium. There was a time that Annic Nova could be
published, and few would even bat an eyelash. As time passed, and more hard
"facts" about Jump Travel appeared, some decided that the Annic Nova could
not be rehabilitated with the newer understanding of jump space. It would be
difficult, for example, to publish something like Shadows nowadays, because,
as you stated Leonard, you can\'t change just one thing (in this case, the
introduction of a new, technologically advanced ancient species). The list
goes on and on.

The change in the *feel* of the Imperium is a very important one, which is
why I tried to take the focus off of the technological aspect a bit in my
original post. I wasn\'t advocating the inclusion of bio-tech, or
cybernetics, or nanotech, I was simply saying that the canon of the larger
beast of sci-fi has changed (it\'s actually undergone a revolution), and the
even larger canon of the real world has changed.

The post-cold war Soviet / U.S. Solomani is starting to look extremely dated
to folks who don\'t even remember what a true communist super power was like.
The reflection of the then current politics of the U.S. and the Soviet Union
in the form of the Imperium and the Zhodani is no longer current (although I
have to hand it to the TNE folks, "updating" the Zhodani to the status of
their real world counterparts via the Empress Wave was a rather interesting
twist).

I\'m not advocating anything at all. A fact is a fact. I remember back when
Loren was playtesting GURPS Traveller, he posted his nanotechnology sidebar.
There was at least one person who said that they\'d rather see that space go
to something more important, but Loren is a canny fellow. He kept it in.
It\'s an issue that comes up on this list with a fair amount of frequency. It
gets a lot of discussion. He handled it well. There was no furious
handwaving, none of this "...the Vilani are so conservative..." garbage. He
didn\'t say that it might turn out to be a dead end technology, and so that
in the interest of keeping Traveller as "hard science" it couldn\'t be
allowed. What he did say was that elements of nanotech are at odds with the
Traveller universe, that\'s why it\'s not in there. Clear, plain, concise
prose.

That rhetorical decision was absolutely brilliant on Loren\'s part. On one
hand, he explains it plainly, no handwaves needed. He said what everybody
really means when they call on Vilani conservatism, or alludes that it might
be a dead end technology. It causes problems.

The best part about the way that Loren handled it? It doesn\'t squash
imagination. He even gave folks a gentle nudge toward the Imperial Research
station idea (use it sparingly, folks), but more importantly it doesn\'t
close the door entirely. If a GM feels that it might work, he puts it in. If
it doesn\'t, no harm done. Most GMs have made mistakes in the past. No
biggie. With the current understanding of nanotech in the Traveller
universe, it\'s still possible that someone might write a piece for Pyramid
on how GMs might rectify it in the Third Imperium. People may read this
piece, use it, hammer it out... and *voila* canon would be formed the way
that canon had been formed in the days of CT. Slow accretion of ideas
cribbed from modern scientific trends and modern sci-fi canon that people
generally agreed upon and could refer to in the future.

What do you think that 8.5 DT cargo bay is for?

I think there is nearly 8 cubic foot of spare space in a passenger module. The 8
modules added together would have enough spare space for a cramped airplane
style toilet. The module also costs slightly more than I calculate it should, so
you could handwave that it is already included.

I can understand SJG being different in this regard - since they already
have a playtest site, they probably believe that this is enough of a forum
to "thrash out" (sorry, Chris ;-) the design concepts and rules.

[I know that if you sign the SJG disclaimer and submit something to them
for publication, you cannot put the same thing up on your website. That\'s
why Jesse\'s images are different to the ones in the published G:T books,
for example].

Is this the official SJG position: "We already have a forum, so we don\'t
need to reference the TML, thank you"?

Keith, Chris, Loren, your comments?

I\'m sorry, but that just isn\'t so.  The AMSAT microsattellites launched
in 1990 used V40 processors -- basically 80186 clones.  One of them has
been running for five years since its last reset.  This says a lot for
the radiation tolerance of the CPU, and of the stability of its
operating system (SCOS).  No windows here!

Off the top of my head, some other "modern" processors currently on
orbit:
Space Shuttle remote manipulator system (robot arm) joint control
electronics: 80186
Space Shuttle payload general support computer (IBM thinkpad): 486
Radarsat: 80386
Hubble Space Telescope: 80386
UoSAT-12: 80386 and 80387
Cassini: RAD 6000

There are a bunch of modern processors that are currently being
integrated into spacecraft for launch in the next 12 months.  I\'m afraid
I\'m not allowed to give program names for these:
URK-32 (rad-hard sparc station)
Motorola DSP56000 series
Power PC
StrongARM

Actually, I did a similar thing, more as a way to scare the bejeesus out
of my players when they figured out what it was. The nanites were the
size of a grain of sand, all identical.

I didn\'t have any game rules for designing the thing, so I just winged
it. If anyone wants my "specs" I\'d be happy to share \'em.

It did lead to two classic scenes, both occurring in the engineering
room of the ship the PCs used. 

The first was when one of the PCs stumbled across the dead body of the
engineer, about a minute after conversing with that same engineer in
another part of the ship. The T1000 had mimicked the person he had just
killed, but nobody realized it at the time.

The second was when they were in combat with their "engineer", who had
just taken an ACR blast to the midsection. I had the T1000 do the famous
finger-waggling scene out of T2 (you know the one), and then everyone
suddenly realized they were in a world of trouble.

Later on, though, they actually got the T1000 to join their side, which
made for some interesting adventures.

Yeah, I know it was a blatant ripoff, but it was fun as hell.

It should be fairly simple. just insert mammoth DNA into an elephant

you\'ll have a baby mammoth.

Of course, they\'ve still got the problem of the DNA being from an
adult, and thus limited in the number of divisions before old age sets
in. That\'s what\'s happening to Dolly.

Still, we\'ll lick it eventually. And maybe mammoth meat may be as
common as buffalo in the future. 

Traveller scenarios? Beside background stuff like herds of mammoths on
Terra or other planets, you have the possibility of being hired to ship
a *live* mammoth. 

Or, going farther afield, have a similar discovery on some planet. A
member of a long extinct species is found frozen or otherwise preserved
in some remote area with a *lousy* climate. The task is to extract the
critter intact, and transport it to lab facilities without damaging it.

Sorry, but the characters *aren\'t* sufficiently larger than life. And
there\'s nothing even *close* to a "real" superweapon.

Well, it\'s still kinda toned down from the Lensman stories it\'s more or
less descended from.

	I\'m almost 99.9% positive the lander actually used a Rad6000. I know
for a fact it used the VxWorks commercial RTOS (realtime operating
system). Likewise, I believe DS-1 used a fairly modern 32-bit CPU,
possibly another R6K.

	So you do it often enough to get one each viable male and female,
who make it to sexual maturity, and work on "natural" progeny,
probably via artificial insemination and elephant host-mothers until
you get enough offspring you can try the standard way.

Reminds me of an argument that raged within the pages of a game-oriented
APA (Amateur Press Association -- a form of fan communication that existed
before the Usenet, the Web, and mailing lists such as this one), between
two RPG players with radically different views on RPG play:

One saw RPGs as a chance to role-play, to dramatize a character and get
into various situations interacting with other characters.

The other saw RPGs as some form of interactive puzzle solving -- to 
him, a character sheet represented probabilities, and an RPG game as a
session of solving puzzles and thinking through problems. 

Each, of course, thought the other was totally out of his mind -- the
second couldn\'t understand why the first put so much effort into coming
up with character background and personality and so on, while the first
wondered what attraction the second had to RPGs in the first place.

(I count myself in the first camp, though I was not either of the two
gamers involved in the argument.) The dramatists / simulationists dichotomy
fits the two guys rather well, I\'d say...

Otter: A good source for some overview is the MT imperial encyclopaedia,
available near me for under US$10.00 at my UFNUBS (UnFriendly Nearby Used
Book Store). it includes all the material from CT Supps 8 & 11.

Another good bit, should you be able to find it, is CT\'s "The Traveller
Adventure", which shows it\'s age, but reaffirmed my feelings of CT, and
gives a lot of (probably now superceeded) color on a number of worlds along
the Aramis Trace in the Spinward Marches. Check at www.boscos.com for the
latter. They had one on the shelf within the last month or so (they\'re my
FLGS). They also recently had a copy of Supplement 7 Traders and Gunboats,
with all the nice deckplans... But clean out boscos while you can... Peter
Newman no longer works there, so they prolly won\'t purchase any more used
CT/MT/TNE/T4 materials.

TNE\'s Regency Sourcebook is a good set of UPP data immediately post-CT and
also the TNE era data; it may or may not have materials you want. If you
still read UPP\'s, it is a good bit, and it includes a good bit of Domain of
Deneb (Spinward Marches, Reft, Corridor, and ??? sectors [drawing a blank
and too lazy to look it up...)

Definitely pick up Far Trader (for GT); I don\'t care for muching about with
the economics, but if you\'re gonna use GT, you may as well go hog wild
there. Not much background, but good trade rules and economics bits.

They wooly mammoth itself is really pretty old news. I remember seeing a
photo of it in my old Childcraft books. They\'ve been talking about cloning
it for some time now. They made the decision a few weeks ago, it was a hot
topic among my friends at the diner.

I myself just sat and said, "I saw that Jurassic Park movie with Jeff
Goldblum, and he said nature finds a way! We\'ll all be crushed and gored by
prehistoric beasts, you\'ll see!"

Sorry. Ahem. I\'m better now.

A bloodthirsty baby mammoth. Get a few of them together and they\'ll change
sex, reproduce, and gore and trample their way across the surface of the
earth. Whoops... I said I was better, didn\'t I?

I\'m glad I\'m not the only one who thought this.

I hope that they manage to clone an ankylosaur. I\'ve got a bet with a friend
of mine that ankylosaurs will have the most succulent meat of all of the
prehistoric beasties, by far. I am perhaps the only person who saw Jurassic
Park and wished that we could have Jurassic Burger.

The extra cost comes from using the Weight parameter of x1 for a 
TL9 Fusion Reactor slice for the TL10 version and a TL10 Fusion 
Reactor slice (weight and cost parameters) for the TL12 version.  

Adjusted values :
GTL10 Passenger Module : 1 dTon (- 8cf), 0.073 MCr, 0.54 sTons

Alas, the timelag for anyplace beyond Lunar orbit will mean that you\'d
be *incredibly* isolated by posthuman standards. Consider that the
maximum lag time on earth is going to be around 400 msec. 

To geosynch orbit is about 250 msec. Relaying *via* geosynch is about
500 msec. 

To Luna, lag is about 2600 msec.

To Mars at closest approach, it\'s around 300,000 msec. At farthest,
it\'s about 1,300,000 msec.

location  lag factor
- ----  ----
Earth	  1
Luna      6.5
Mars      750 to 3250

See why there\'s a problem?

In Traveller terms, Earth would be "in system" (ie less than a day away)
Luna would be J1. But mars would be clear across the Imperium (j-107 to
j-464).

"Real time" links with Luna aren\'t possible, but you can get cclose
enough that it\'s only annoying. Real time links with Mars and the rest
of the planets are simply impossible. Email only. 

The Earth network and the Mars network can exchange data, but never
truly link.

I wonder if that\'s one of the "provably correct" designs the Europeans
have come up with for safety critical systems? The entire design is
convertible to a set of mathematical formulae that can (with efffort)
be proven to be correct. Thus no hidden "gotchas" like the Pentium
floating point bug. 

It\'s a slow way to design. And a royal pain to extend. But it
eliminates one of the nastier variables from the safety equation. 

Of course, you still have to prove that the chip as made matches the
design. Which was done for the chip(s) I\'m thinking of. 

Next you have to build a bug-free assembler. Once again, this is a
doable, but manpower intensive process. And then you can go on to try
for bug-free compilers. 

Then, finally you are supposed to try to produced code that can be
verified as bug free. As far as I know, the entire process has only
been carried out for a few nuclear power plants.

But if we ever have a siginificantly *bad* computer related accident,
or if we hit a plateau in computer performance, I expect that
eventually we *will* go to such a system. And it would slow a lot of
things down.

Is that one of the ones they "hardened" by embedding the chip in a

Well, if it is semiconductor based, there *is* a limit on the size of
"circuit elements" if you want it to avoid random bit flips from stray
radiation. And it\'s *way* larger than current generation chips. More
like early 70s tech.

What seems more likely, is that he\'d have the "muscle memory" (learned
reflexes). So he could likely play any piece the pianist had known
well, but only if he didn\'t "think about it" much.

Data point: I\'ve read of a case where a Vietnam vet who\'d effectivly
been lobotomized by a shell fragment was still able to play his guitar.
He could play any early Stones song you could name, but couldn\'t learn
any new songs or even new chords.

Great pic. The Imperial money was also terrific, but I believe both should
probably have both Galanglic and Bilanidin script. Which brings up: What is
the proper Bilanidin official OTU title of the Third Imperium and how is it
rendered in Bilanidin? I\'d like to post a copy of Norris\'s Warrant at my
website Regina Highport: http://members.home.net/carlino/ once I get the
Bilanidin rendered properly. (What better place to display a holographic
copy than the museum at Atora?)

There\'s always a critic ;)

I considered in for the bill, but I kind of dropped the idea. I\'m becoming a
genuine CT purist these days, and the Vilani seem to play a different role
there. Galanglic is the lingua franca, and I\'m of the opinion that it should
be the only lingua on the Franc! ;)

If an answer doesn\'t turn up, Kenji, over at the Traveller-Culture list
might be able to help you out.

Glenn Hoppe, the fellow who came up with the fine Bilanidin font said this
of it in the included t-file:

"In constructing this typeface, I have assumed that it is the writing system
developed after the Vilani contacted other races, esp. Solomani, and was
used to transliterate Solomani documents, etc."

What destruct sequence? Seriously, there\'s no good reason for a ship to
routinely be equipped with such a device. And a fusion reactor should
be no more capable of going "boom" than a coal fired powerplant. In
both cases given *hours* of preparation, you could rig up a blast, but
it wouldn\'t be easy.

please note that 15 minutes is 900 seconds. At 1 g, in 900 seconds you
cover: 
	D = .5 * a * t^2
        D = .5 * 10 * 900^2
	D = 4,050 km

That gets you beyond any *blast* effects. Radiation effects are a bit
harder to escape, but assuming the launch is safe to use during a major
solar flare, you\'ll be safe that way too.

Excel 97 should still support saving in SYLK format. Save in that, and
then import the resulting file back into Excel 95.

SYLK is an *old* MS format. It\'s even importable into their old
Multiplan program. That\'s because they way SYLK is organized, the older
programs can just ignore the feature settings for features they don\'t
have. But the data will still import.

There were quite a handful made in the late seventies/early eighties as Star
Wars knockoffs. The Last Starfighter is one. Ice Pirates another. There was
one with George Peppard, and the guy who played the Man from Uncle and the
actor who played John Boy from the Waltons loosely based on the Seven
Samurai, I can\'t remember the name.

Jackson Whole is not evil! Just that evil pays better.

If anything , Jackson Whole represents a true Technological Feuldal system, with
the Houses controlling people like vassels.

Actually the Vorkostigab series is a great look at societies influenced by
technology (and has almost the same communication lags). And what do they get?

Earth : High Tech balkanised world, a backwater only due to lack of wormwholes.

Beta : High Tech Californian Democracy mixed with Singaporean socal programming

Cetaganda : High Tech Caste Based Feudal system hell bent on geneticly modifying
themselves, and conquuring the galaxy to pay for it.

Barrayar : Middle Tech bootstaping itself to high tech , Caste based Neo-Feudal
evolving into something?

Athos : Low Tech with high tech biotech to support a male only population -
religous bent

Escobar : High tech , govt unknown (possably democracy).

Kline Station : High tech trading port - al la Hong Kong

Jacksons Whole : "What happens when a planet gets taken over by Libitarian
Hijackers". Anything can be bought here, as long as you can afford it. Thats the
only law.

Kommar : Occupided coperate world , with a wealth based oligarchy.


Another point is technology itself.

The way technology playes here is that technology bleeds outwards. Technology
generally appears in High tech worlds (Beta , Illyria), and gets traded outwards
to the lower tech nations (generally after a counter is developed, but not
allways). Thus an insane arms race of development and counter development where
even the lower tech planets can come out with a supprise or two (The Prince Serg
in the Vor Game). Example is the Plasma based weaponry on space ships. Long
range plasma bolts use to rule the roost, until Beta with the Sword Swollower
literlly turned the plasma against them. Then the rules get changed again with
the Grav Imploder, an again when Barrayar optamise the Grav Imploder to increase
its range by a factor of 3.

I perosnally believe Bujold has a better grasp of interstellar trade than
Traveller (Sorry Marc, Loren), where governments at war will pay through their
teeth for the bleeding edge weapons, and there a people willing to sell (Jackson
Whole, or Beta Colony if they are almost legit). Thus these cultures become
addicted to the high tech ,and begin to import the means to produce it
themselves (capital production), A lot like Japan after Re-opening conatct with
the world. The reason that planets are lower tech is due by location or choice
(Barrayar was isolated by accident during preliminary terraforming, Athos by
choice, other planets on remote wormholes would likely see less trade, but dont
forget even they would proberbly see a Kommmarian Trade fleet once every year or
so).

I was actually thinking along the lines of the drives overloading to
critical mass
if this is possible.  I assumed that the sinks (or capacitors) would be
where the
necessary energy would be stored, either in a reserve or in the process of
building 
up as in preparation for jump.  The difference is that the sequence is some
how
interupted or modified to go critical.  I estimated the time required to
charge up
the capacitors as the time to prepare for jump.  I WAG\'d this as 10 minutes
for the
size ship and drive and added another 5 minutes as a safety factor for the
escaping
crew.  There does not appear to be anything that gives total preparation
time for
jump in any of the literature, therefore I calculated it as twice the
percentage of
the total hull displacement for the either the jump drive or power plant,
which ever 
is used.

I see the destruct sequence as similar to the events that occurred in the
movie "Alien."
I think most PC\'s have this ingrained in their head.  A lot of action
occurred between
the initiation of the destruct sequence and the final "blow."  I also think
that the
destructive results would be more dramatic in vacuum than on the surface of
a planet.
But I\'m not a physicist.

So how much destructive force is held in a 2000 megawatt drive?  Or is
there a simple
way of calculating this?

Pournelle\'s "Falkenberg\'s Legion" stories also fall into this
definition:

Grand Sweep:  Yes (both CoDominium controlled worlds and "independent"
worlds)

Larger Than Life characters:  Yes (Col. Falkenberg, Sgt. Maj. Calvin,
Prince Lysander of Sparta, Glenda Ruth Horton of New Washington, etc.)

Good versus Evil:  Yes (the Grant/Blaine faction vs. the Bronson
faction)

Superweapons:  Not quite, but there are super _units_ (Line Marines,
Falkenberg\'s Legion, the Spartan Brotherhoods, Meiji technoninjas, etc.)

Works for me....

_We The Living_:  Could be set in M:0 (the new regime replacing the old)

_The Fountainhead_:  This works in the 3I, circa M:1100 (worship of the

_Anthem_:  Definitely a Long Night story

_Atlas Shrugged_:  This works in either the end of the Rule of Man, or
the decline of the 3I

Given Ayn Rand\'s characterization and plotting, her novels would
translate well as space opera (IMHO)....

I was waiting for someone to answer. I haven\'t seen anyone do so...

Summary:

1. Some people want a descriptive task system for GURPS

2. Some people don\'t think it matters

3.  Several suggestions were made for a possible Traveller like Task
System for GRUPS, all shared the idea of adding or subtracting fixed
numbers from the appropriate skill for named difficulty levels.  I
can\'t do them all justice, but these are the ones I remember as I
remember them and how I think of them.

In all cases, determine the Difficulty, add the associated modifer
to the skill, and roll lower on 3d6 with 3 an automatic success and
17+ automatic failure.

"This stuff is a piece of cake!"

 +4 Easy
 +2 Routine
  0 Difficult
 -2 Formidable
 -4 Staggering
 -6 Impossible

 EX:  Skill 14, Task Staggering,  Roll <= 10 (50%)
- ----

"It\'s a Hard, Hard World!"

  +5 Easy
   0 Routine/Average
  -5 Difficult
 -10 Formidable
 -15 Staggering
 -20 Impossible

 EX:  Skill 14, Task Staggering, Roll <= -1 (<1%)
- ----
  
"A little BITS of heaven!"

  +6 Easy
  +3 Routine
   0 Difficult
  -3 Formidable
  -6 Staggering
  -9 Impossible   <-- I reverse
 -12 Hopeless     <-- these two, myself
 
 EX:  Skill 14, Task Staggering, Roll <= 8 (26%)
- ----

The third of these Task Systems seems like the best *to me*, but of
course, YMMV.

  IIRC, the technical term is "Sweet F.A.".  However, you can still find 
stuff that\'s both far cheaper and better than the crap from GW - and not
in the ever so popular 28-30mm heroic scale. One product line I find works
fairly well is "Denizen", from Stone Mountain Miniatures:     
        http://www.HistoricalMiniatures.com/

  They\'re maybe a teensy bit smaller than the old Grenadier 25mm Trav
mini\'s, but that\'s simply not an issue for most people.

  Supposedly you can still get 15mm mini\'s that might mix well with 
the old Citadel Traveller 15\'s, but I can\'t prove that yet.

This may work - when Netscape doesn\'t display on my Mac (v4.06 Navigator,
OS8.5) I usually try iCAB (from http://www.icab.de/) The demo is free,
stable, small and does everything bar javascript (not implemented yet).
Usually it works. YMMV.

Yeah, basically.

It\'s a sort of an eco-disaster novel where a hive of intelligent insects in
the Amzon area realizes that humans are destroying the planet, so it
manufactures increasingly believable replicas of humans built out of
thousands of insects in order to infiltrate the humans and figure out how to
get rid of them.

This is obvious in the first few pages of the book, so is not a problem re:
spoilers.

The story really is not about the "alien",  as all good SF it spends most of
it\'s time exploring the concepts of freedom and choice, as the hive-mind
starts to come to terms with the value humans place on "single units", and
why it can\'t seem to reliably predict  individual human actions.

I will warn people who find insects worrying psychologically not to read the
book. The concepts and things that happen make even my skin crawl and I
don\'t normally get worried by "icky" things. But for ickiness, Herbert\'s
other "insect-related" book "Hellstrom\'s Hive" about a "hive" of humans is
worse.

Although, like many Herbert books, it can get a little esoteric in it\'s
discussion between characters because it\'s quite small, only 150-odd pages,
it doesn\'t get over the top as it does in "The White Plague" or "God Emperor
of Dune". That being said, Herbert has always explored the "cultural"
effects of technology quite well, and I actually like "God Emperor", as it
discusses how to maintain interstellar empires over time in more detail than
any other book I can think of.

Hebert has wonderful concepts to mine for SF games, from things like the
nerve runners in "The Jesus Incident" to the Tleilaxu Face Dancers from
"Dune".

Installed Roomy Crew Stations for the TL8/9 versions.  

As John pointed out, there doesn\'t appear to be any fresher 
capability included with passengers seats.  Well, just handwave it.  If 
you just have to have it, then remove a couple of seats and put in a 
folding bunk but be sure to note that in any descriptions.

Revised the description on the time it takes to reach orbit with and 
without an atmosphere.  This is really only a problem at TL8/9 due 
to the low sAcc parameter.

I hope this batch is better :)

Conscription never came to the Australian military until Vietnam.  Then,
after Vietnam, it was policy that Australian troops would not be used in any
overseas conflict other than "peace keeping operations." (although I believe
there was a caveat mentioning something to the effect of "until a period of
at least 50-years").  This was slightly broken when the RAN sent warships in
support of her American Allies and the Multi-national forces in the Middle
East against Sadam.  "Slightly broken" in the sense that Australia (as far
as the public are concerned) never took part in any actual fighting.

The Australian Armed Forces are basically a reactionary force in defence of
our home shores (and the most highly trained of these being north ender
reservists!).  Should the <insert possible Asian antagonists here> invade
this wide brown land, the concept is to defend and hold (if not expulsion of
the enemy) until our dear friends and allies, the Americans, come and help
us out logistically and with manpower as required.

Okay, this is the 90\'s (well, nearly the 22nd century), and I will admit
that this doctrine was valid in the 70\'s and 80\'s... I am not sure if it
still stands at this time, but I can find out when my mates get back from
Timor.  :^)

Depends on what rules set you have. Since fusion reactors (all the
experimental designs) can\'t \'go critical\' like fission reactors can, I
would go with the capacitor overload idea.

Check how many energy points you need to jump, if using High Guard. An
explicit amount of energy is mentioned in FF&S2 (64 MJ/cubic metre
displacement/jump number).

Convert this into a TNT mass equivalent, and... voila!

I had asked some time ago (when I first subbed to this list) if any Aussies
had played a part in the naming of systems in that sub-sector because the
name leapt out at me.  I lost all my bookmarks shortly before I joined the
list, so I can\'t confirm or even say where to look now.  Although a world
named "Vegemite" would suit the culture. :^)

Recall that the left hemisphere is dominant in 85-90% of the population,

The motor cortex is located in the parietal lobe, on the upper convexity

Other areas are involved in storing motor \'programs\' :- zones of the
cortex near the areas involved with language, and importantly the
cerebellum at the base of the brain, behind the brain stem.

The cerebellum is the primary organiser of learned muscle movements, and
also regulates \'anti-gravity\' muscle tone and responses to propioceptive
input.

The spinal cord deals mainly with reflex, stereotyped movements.
The evidence for spinal cord programming of more complex movements is a
bit lacking.

I reckon it\'s possible to shoe-horn all of the more interesting
possibilities based on developments since 1977 into the game. Loren
Wiseman has acknowledged this in part with the section on nanotech in
G:T, as Chris Seamans points out.

IMHO, the official Trav universe doesn\'t get close to Vingean
singularity over 3 millennia of progress because it\'s not as easy as the
Terran neopositivists of the late 20th - early 21st century thought it
would be (notwithstanding the fact that Vinge didn\'t really start the
ball rolling until the late \'80s).

"If you really understand trend curves, you can extrapolate them into
the future and discover some baffling things. The speed trend curve
alone predicts that manned vehicles will be able to achieve near
infinite speeds by 1982... The trend curve for controllable energy is
rising rapidly... By 1981, this trend curve shows that a single man will
have available under his control the amount of energy equivalent to that
generated by the entire sun."

- - G. Harry Stine, \'Science Fiction is Too Conservative\', Analog Science
Fact and Fiction, May 1961.

Nanotech? Femtotechnology (nuclear manipulation)? Bedevilled by problems
of quantum limits, thermal stability, fuelling, control failures (the
\'great grey goo\' problem) across average Imperial TLs.

Advanced biotech? In the RW, we have literally millions of data points
(more appear every day), and no obvious motifs to tie everything
together (I acknowledge evolution, chemistry and physics, but biological
order is *complex*).
    This data is from maybe 1/3 of the organisms on one planet ; it\'s
estimated that 1/2 to 2/3 of the organisms in our guts are unknown to
contemporary microbiology.

Cyborgs and personality uploading? The computing power required to model
*trillions* of components (neurons) \'talking\' to each other is literally
mind-boggling. This obviously puts limits on robot and computer AI.
    I agree with Bill Hostman ; the cyberware that appeared in
Traveller\'s Digest is quite reasonable, compared with the various
cyberpunk RPGs (reflex or muscle power augmentation without mandatory
bone and tendon reinforcement? No way).
    The various \'medical\' articles that have appeared in TD, etc. are
reasonably gentle too, dealing with regenerative and cloning tech, and
some not too over the top pharmaceuticals.

The OTU hasn\'t even explored the broader implications of :-
- - cheap fusion power ;
- - the ability to manipulate gravity, and the strong and weak forces.
(although I guess this may be outside the ambit of an RPG per se).

E.g. :-
Two \'canon\' devices, laser gravitational focussing and the gravisonic
modulator, imply that the ability to manipulate gravity is very advanced
by average Trav tech levels.

The gravitational lensing required to focus lasers should have other
applications e.g. crash restraints for air/grav/space craft(?).

Pyro/cryokinesis can be simulated by the gravisonic modulator. All
refrigeration and heating units should operate on gravisonic principles
- - no moving parts to fail, no refrigerant gases/liquids to leak, etc.

One would think that laser grav focussing and the ability to produce
superdense materials should be intimately linked. Interestingly,
superdense appears at the same TTL as nuclear damper tech. The ability
to synthesise stable superheavy elements in the \'island of stability\'
may be relevant in the construction of SD.

They\'ve got *one* Mammoth body. It\'ll be male or female. Any clones
will *all* be the same sex as the body.

If the body is male, then *someday*, we may be able to replace the Y
chromosome with a an X taken from another cell. That\'d give us a
female. One with *every* recessive gene on that X chromosome paired up,
and thus expressing.

So, if the body is male, it might be possible to get a more or less
damaged female. If the body is female there\'s no way to get a male.

But, let\'s go with the male body, and the sickly female clone. 

Any offspring are going to be inbred like you wouldn\'t believe. *All*
their genes will be from *one* individual.

Actually, "Anthem" works ok on any world with a sufficiently *extreme*

number, and very diverse in the programs we\'ve access to, but we\'re slowly

I know I\'ve had a couple of private (and TML I think) conversations
regarding a project of this type.  I\'ve been too busy on my end with work
for "Starports" to do anything with it myself.  The deadline is really close
now at this point and I should have free time soon, so I\'ll make this offer:

If others are interested in contributing material to the project, I can host
it at my Vision Forge Graphics domain.  I have unlimited space and unlimited
traffic.  Only prob is everything would have to be updated by me as the p/w
would be the same as the rest of my site.  This may lead to bottlenecks
while I\'m in the troes of a deadline.  An alternative would be having it
hosted at www.downport.com.  I think this would be a great alternative
myself, especially if different people can do the updating.

Ideas for content would be similar to other 3D collections sites like the
Star Wars Modelling Alliance and SciFi Art.  PD (public domain) objects,
textures, tutorials, 3D artwork, 2D artwork, etc.  Usage would have to be
worked out, or just flat "no commercial use allowed".  An example would be
no matter how cool an object was, I couldn\'t put it in one of my SJG shots
because that would be a commercial use (profit for me and SJG).  An
alternative is profit sharing if you\'re published and you\'ve used others
objects.  Say 10-50%, depending on the object.  I WILL tell you to keep
you\'re day job though :)  Even though I do all my own stuff for my shots
(\'cept occaisionally some licensed or PD textures), I certainly don\'t make
enough to only do this for a living.  Ah, how I wish....but that\'s another
story.

If you\'re interested in contributing, just want to give encouragement, or
even want to tell me to stick it, please e-mail me directly **** with
[Trav3D] **** in the subject line PLEASE (this\'ll help me sort the mail).
That\'s only the bracketed part [Trav3D] for you smart-asses out there ;)

Nope. You are confusing older mammoth finds with this one. There have
been lots of partail finds over then years, as people stumbled across a
carcass that was startung to wash out of the permafrost, or had washed
out to a greater or lesser extent. 

But this one was somehow located while still totally buried. They dug
it out, and only *moved* it this week.

Ain\'t gonna happen soon if it all. Contrary to what they showed in
Jurassic Park, it\'s *really* unlikely that usable dinosaur DNA could be
extracted from amber. And unlike mammoths, who are closely related to
elephants, we don\'t have anything at all close to implant dinosaur DNA
in.

Ok, I\'m going by an aricle from the 80s in one of the computer or

background which seems to be old hat to the majority of posters, and while
it all seems extremely interesting, due to budget constraints I can\'t
exactly pick up every CT product and JTAS ever published.  So like a
piker, I\'m wondering if there\'s some readily (i.e. very cheaply)
accessible source from which I can garner at least the basics of the CT
campaign background
</Otter>

My recommendation for a good single source would be the GURPS: Traveller
main source book.  It contains most of the background up until the
rebellion.  For the rebellion you\'re going to need the Imperial
Encyclopedia.  OTOH, I\'m sure that if you list off things you want to know
about, some TMLer will be more than willing to blather on and on about
them :-).

critical mass if this is possible.  I assumed that the sinks (or capacitors) 
would be where the necessary energy would be stored, either in a reserve
or in the process of building up as in preparation for jump.  The difference
is that the sequence is some how interupted or modified to go critical.  I 
estimated the time required to charge up the capacitors as the time to 
prepare for jump.  I WAG\'d this as 10 minutes for the size ship and drive
and added another 5 minutes as a safety factor for the escaping crew.
>>>>>>>>>>
Ah-hah. The ship isn\'t really using a self-destruct device, it\'s simply
performing a deliberate and catastrophic misjump. It sounds to me like
the theory behind your WAG was good to go.

I might give such a ship a chance of performing a less-than-catastrophic
misjump instead - yes, she might vaporize or vanish into jump space,
but it also might just have her drives disappear, or she might vanish
for two weeks and reappear multi-parsecs away.

Of course, being trapped on a crippled ship for two weeks in jump space
might be pretty catastrophic in itself.

AFAIK, no. It\'s been a long time since Bio/Psy for me, but I think the

Nope. I\'m not. This is just the most recent in a long line of intact, or
very nearly intact Mammoths that have been discovered in Siberia in the last
century or so. The first one was discovered at the turn of the century and
they Russians managed to skin it and stuff it and otherwise preserve it with
the crude techniques of the day.

In the 70s a calf was unearthed by a construction team in Siberia. This one
was very nearly intact (it had just been unearthed). A sample of the tissue
was sent to the U.S. Another one was found a short time later. DNA was
extracted from one of these guys, maybe both of them. I remember reading in
the mid-80s that they managed to isolate the DNA in one of the popular
science rags. Although at that point, cloning seemed very far off, it was
stated optimistically that one day this beast might be cloned.

In the 80s another very well preserved mammoth was discovered, almost
completely intact (missing its trunk and its tail.) Don\'t know what happened
to this guy, I just remember it as one of those human interest (mammoth
interest?) blurbs.

This most recent fellow is very nearly completely intact, missing only the
tusks which natives hacked off and sold to a French explorer.

I\'m out of the loop on this recent mammoth. I remember hearing about it
quite a few months ago, to the effect that the French wanted to move him at
some point in the future. The big deal is that if the French get him back
home, this will be the first mammoth that non-Soviet / non-Russian
scientists will be able to study fully. The Soviets jealously guarded their
mammoths and sent pieces out to other countries for study.

[I checked the Discovery Channel website just now, and there\'s a nifty
timeline that agrees with mine to a large extent, and gives better dates, if
anyone\'s interested the address is:
http://www.discovery.com/exp/mammoth/mammoth.html There\'s also a tantalizing
comment that in \'95 the French accused the Russian Mafia of conspiring to
get to mammoth carcasses before scientists].

Now there\'s an ObTrav for you. A group of Travellers are hunting ancient
artifacts... only to be foiled time and time again by Vargr organized crime
groups. (Yes, Vargr organized crime really exists, to the extent that it can
be considered organized, and the TNE crew clearly patterned them on the
Russian mafia who were quite popular at the time.

So Leonard, an Avatar (Emissary to the Prophets), the disgraced warrior who
becomes a hero among the enemies of his people, only to be adopted by the
family of a legendary general and then kills the despotic leader of the
Empire who is the enemy of his family and so changes history, and the one of
a kind shapeshifting alien who turns out the be the key to defeating the
ravaging , unbeatable enemy empire aren\'t characters that are larger than
life? Gee you must know some interesting people.

You\'re looking right now at one the greatest resources for Traveller
material in existence. (No not the TML, though it is an excellent resource,)
I meant the Net, you know the great big WWW. I\'ve got at least 75 good
Traveller bookmarks, almost all of which contain great amounts of Traveller
material. And I don\'t even generally bookmark MT & TNE stuff cause I don\'t
do the Rebellion or Virus.

Email me and I\'ll send you the shortcuts (if you use Windows) or the
addresses in email (if you don\'t). The shortcuts are easier for me, if you
can use them.

I mentioned in an earlier post that .DXf is one of the more universal
formats. .DXF doesn\'t permit the importation of texture
data, it\'s pretty much just the polygons (and it is POLYS only, no
fancy-schmancy NURBS or other exotic surfacing critters) but just about
every program out there will import a .dxf file.

But, there are programs like CrossRoads (on Windows) and Imagery on the
Mac will translate among formats. I know, for instance that .cob and .lwo
files are openable on Imagery, and saveable to other formats. Crossroads
is more versatile. The aithor of Crossroads, iirc, also has a Mac version,
but it\'s like version 0.001a, meaning "Does it crash when you double-click
it? No? Great! No quit, it can\'t do anything else" ;-)

Deciding on common formats will take some doing. When I get home and
figure out what it is that I can open, I\'ll post the list. If the other
3DFolk want to do the same (that way we can figure out who we all are) We
can start looking at building a modelling repository.

I\'m not particularly fond of the Vingean singularity for a few different
reasons. The first is that it\'s frequently used by opponents in any sort of
Traveller technological / sociological debate who imply that such a path is
a given (the same with the Banks AI model). The second is that, with all due
respect to Banks and Vinge, their future is but one possible vision of the
future.

As a result, any AI path that doesn\'t end in a Banksian universe, or any
combined use of technology that doesn\'t end in a Vingean singularity is
ruled out. I disagree, largely for many of the same reasons that you do.

Yes. Any artificial system that\'s designed for quantifying anything is going

Fair enough. Even so, you still have to think this one through. The "great
grey goo" problem, for example, is a nasty one. What happens if the Ine
Givar get ahold of them, or the Solomani. You still have the problem of it
existing. Internal TU handwaves can break down at one point or another in
the same way that new additions can break down.

Yes, but unfortunately, that\'s not the way it is in canon. We\'ve got the

That\'s only one AI model, the "strong" AI model, in which sentience can be
attained only by modelling the human brain. The "weak" AI model is quite
different, in that AI can be built from the ground up, possibly turning out
an entirely different way of doing things.

The Cyberpunk 2020 RPG and Shadowrun encompass the most banal elements of
the genre and are based, poorly, almost entirely on the earlier works of
William Gibson.

When I said cyberpunk, I meant then, and I still mean the genre at large,
not one small part of it interepreted by the folks who did Cyberpunk 2020 or
Shadowrun. I have never, and will never advocate anything that looks like
the "chrome Soviet cyber-arm" school of thought.

The problem with cybernetics isn\'t whether or not they\'re in Traveller, but
whether or not the handwave against them holds water. It just doesn\'t. It
makes absolutely no sense that those in power would actively participate in
a form of social exclusion against others of their ilk when that same
technology would allow them to remain in power longer.

It\'s as simple as that. It was an attempt to outlaw munchkinism in the
Traveller universe and it isn\'t really a very good one.

The problem is that you\'re justifying the lack of existence in the Traveller
universe by way of handwaving that these technologies don\'t work for some
reason. That\'s fine, but my whole point is something different.

People should just be honest about canon, and know why they\'re keeping it.
The intent of handwaving is to somehow justify something\'s existence or
inexistence according to canon. Such justifications are not needed.

It\'s much easier to say, "It doesn\'t feel like Traveller," and it\'s much
more effective to boot! It keeps the silly and poorly conceived handwaves
out, which allows for more freedom for individual GMs. It\'s a return to the
roots of Traveller, which was a time when it was possible to add to the
universe in ways that enrich people\'s gaming experience.

As far as I can tell, time requirement is a constant.  It is unclear how much of the power required for an initial jump is actually \'stored\' in any particular way, and how much is just \'spent\' in some obscure way.

That said, ships are _not_ designed to blow up.  The destruct sequence itself could probably be fairly fast, given the power output of a CT power plant you could melt down <power plant rating> percent of the ship every 15 seconds or so.  However, rigging a setup to _do_ this would be an hour or more and a fairly difficult mechanic roll.  Alternately, as someone else pointed out, just setting the jump drive for a catestrophic misjump is viable, though if you have working (and fueled) J-drives it isn\'t obvious why you\'d surrender at all

The equivalent of a 500 kilogram bomb every second.  That sounds more impressive than it is, traveller ships are _tough_ and it isn\'t very efficiently delivered.

Hm.  That\'s not very much; it probably won\'t even destroy the entire ship (15 kilograms of high explosive per cubic meter just isn\'t enough....)

A couple possibilities come to mind:

Battle damage has damaged either the computer or the lanthanum grid
(or hull) sufficiently that a safe jump is impossible. It may still be possible
(in case of computer failure) for the heroic engineer to manually dump
energy into the capacitators in a relatively crude fashion, sufficient
for a catastrophic failure but not controlled well enough for a jump.
How much time said heroic engineer will have to get clear is another
matter altogether.

The ship has lost sufficient fuel that she cannot jump properly, but she
may have enough fuel left to start and catastrophically abort a jump
sequence. The engineer may have to manually take some of the 
capacitors offline so the jump drive will dangerously charge those
remaining.

The ship cannot maneuver. Some TU\'s may require a ship to maneuver
to properly "line up" a jump, or there may be a need to escape a gravity
well.

The ship may be so close to another mass that a jump will almost
certainly be a catastrophe anyway. Rigging the ship to blow may allow
the crew to escape with their lives, especially if their opponents can
be distracted* long enough for the small craft to get safely away.

*Having a chance to capture a starship can be pretty distracting. Getting
blown to particles when said ship explodes can also be very distracting.

Wow, that just gave me an odd parallel thought. I know this wasn\'t what you
were referencing with cards, but since so much to-do is going on with M:TG,
and all these other RPG spin-off card games, what about a Traveller Card
game? If it had alot of character cards, I\'d be tempted to buy them for
encouter purposes alone, and consider other pastimes with them a plus. And
some critter cards, ya gotta have critters.  ;)

        Hi, Leonard!
        I know exactly what you mean.  Very recently, I was obliged to
re-write the entire drug-design system for Cyberpunk 2020...  one of my
players worked out on paper a speed-heal design that invalidated the
existance of *hospitals*...  His drug was so efficient and cost effective
that it was cheaper to take a dozen shots of it over the course of two days
than to visit a hospital...  which also had the effect of invalidating the
existance of at least *one* major corporate power ...  etc, etc...
        The trick in the re-write was coming up with something that didn\'t
break something else.  It took about five tries and play testing to get
something that worked within game economics and atmosphere...

        What does "vingean singularity" mean?  I am unfamiliar with the term.

Patrol Cruiser, TL12

     For some reason, the Patrol Cruiser was left out of
GURPS Traveller. This is based on the patrol cruiser in the
original Traveller rules.
     The patrol cruiser is military vessel used for custom
inspections, piracy supression and normal safety patrols.

Crew: Pilot, Navigator, Sensor Officer, Comm Officer,
Medic, 2 Engineers, 4 Gunners; 0-8 troops may be carried,
but requires some or all of the crew to double-bunk,
depending on number carried

400 ton SL hull, DR 500, 2 turrets with 3 405-MJ lasers
each, 2 turrets with 3 missile racks each, basic stealth,
basic emission cloaking, heavy compartmentalization, basic
bridge, engineering, 50 maneuver, 16 jump, 120 fuel, 2 fuel
processors, 12 staterooms, lowberth, sickbay, utility, 4
spacedock (TL 12 grav APC; see Star Mercs), vehicle bay (30-ton
ship\'s boat), 36.5 cargo

Statistics: EMass 876.4, LMass 1242, Cost MCr 132.513, HP

Performance: Accel 4.03 Gs, Jump 3, Air Speed 3873

Note: Without ship\'s boat and with no cargo load, Accel 5.6
Gs.

Sulieman III-class survey scout

     Conceived by a long forgotten IISS bureaucrat who felt
that the Donosev-class ships were too expensive to build and
maintain, the Type 3 scout was designed to carry out as much
of the Donosev\'s functions as possible, but in a 100 ton
hull. Needless to say, the tight fit resulted in a ship that
was hated by the IISS.
     In order to fit all the necessary scientific gear into
such a small hull, all the crew is forced to double-bunk for
extended periods (of course, Pytheas crews have to do this
too) and cargo space is insufficent. The lack of a modular
cutter proved not to be a real disadvantage; the Type 3 is
streamlined and really doesn\'t need a landing craft.
     The Type 3 served in active duty for 14 years before
being declared as reserve equipment (to the great relief of
countless field scouts), then 8 years later the ships were
stricken from IISS lists. At around the same time they were
being mothballed or scrapped, a commander of a Pytheas-class
scout cruiser requested two of the ships for use on an
extended expedition; when used in conjunction with the
larger ship, the superior science gear of The type 3 (as
compared to the type 1) demonstrated the ship\'s value. Soon,
the Type 3\'s were being attached to many Pytheas as a matter
of routine procedure.
     It took 22 years, but a use was finally found for the
much-maligned Sulieman III-class survey scouts.

Crew: Pilot, Navigator, Sensor Officer, Communications
Officer, Engineer, 4 Survey Specialists

100 ton SL hull, DR 200, basic stealth, basic emission

Sulieman IVa and -b class scout carrier

     Of a similar origin to the Type 3, the Type 4 was
designed to replace the more costly 200-ton modified far
traders used by the IISS. Unlike the Type 3, it has proved
to be a complete bust; one (modified) far trader can still
carry more men and more cargo than two Type 4\'s, and for a
lower cost.
     The smaller size and similarities to the standard
Sulieman kept the Type 4 in service for awhile, but after 11
years all Type 4\'s (except a handful kept to ferry
replacement crews to express boat tenders and scout
cruisers) were sold off at a very low price.
     The privately-owned ships are used to carry middle
passengers (only), and are marginally competative
financially with purpose-built transports on minor or
frontier routes.
     A variant (the Type 4b) has only 2 staterooms and 30.5
cargo (+3 turret). It is 386.625 tons loaded, MCr 24.6416 and
has 1.035 G acceleration. It carries no passengers. Other stats
are as the standard Type 4.

Crew: Pilot and Engineer, plus up to 14 passengers; in IISS
service, one or two passengers with appropriate skills will
help the pilot on the bridge; in private service, add a
Navigator and Medic and drop maximum passengers to 12.

100 ton SL hull, DR 200, basic stealth, basic emission
cloaking, heavy compartmentalization, basic bridge,
engineering, 10 maneuver, 3 jump, 20 fuel, utility, 2 fuel
processors, turret, 1 spacedock (1 air/raft), 8 staterooms,

Low-Berth Liner, TL10

     Originally designed to fill a niche market, carrying a
large number of passengers cheaply, the Frost-class liner
soon was taken into use for the transportation of prisoners
and emergency evacuation of battlefield casualities. It has
also been used to move large number of Army troops to and
from staging areas, though any vehicles, heavy weapons and
suppplies must be carried in another ship (usually a
militarized version of a large merchant ship).
     Note: One ship can usually carry a company (180-240 men).
Three ships can easily transport a battalion (400-600 men; see
Star Mercs for more on unit sizes).

Crew: Pilot/Navigator, Engineer, 2 Medics

100 ton SL hull, DR 100, 1 unarmed turret, basic bridge,
engineering, 8 manuever, 3 jump, 20 fuel, 2 staterooms, 56
low berth (224 low passengers), utility, 1 fuel processor, 1
sickbay, 1 spacedock (air/raft), 4.5 cargo (+3 turret)

Statistics: EMass ?, LMass 301.475, MCr 33.7036, HP 15,000,

Light Intruder, TL12

     Designed as a stealthy way of inserting and retrieving
1 or 2 covert personnel, the light intruder is used by both
the Scouts and Navy (though most of the Navy\'s intruders are
larger and better armed).
     Many components are common with the Sulieman-class
scout in order to ease construction and maintenance costs.
However, there is very little resemblance between the two
ships.
     The light intruder can carry only one or two passengers
and less than one dton of cargo. On the other hand, it is
very fast, stealthy and can make a pair of Jump-2\'s before
it requires refueling (a significant advantage in most
cases, as intruders rarely have the time to hang around and
refuel in a hostile system). Two fuel processors are
provided in case the ship does have a chance to refuel (ex.,
hiding out in the fringes of a gas giant).

Crew: Pilot/Comm Officer, Navigator/Sensor Ops, Engineer,
Gunner/Medic

100 ton SL hull, DR 200, radical stealth, radical emission
cloaking, 1 turret (three 405-MJ lasers), basic bridge,
engineering, 16 maneuver, 3 jump, 40 fuel (enough for 2
consecutive jumps), 3 staterooms, utility, 2 fuel
processors, 1 sickbay, 0.5 cargo

Statistics: EMass ?, LMass 250.875, MCr 52.6234, HP 15,000,

The sequence was:

1. The Seven Samurai (Samurai classic)
2. The Magnificent Seven (Western classic)
3. Battle Beyond the Stars (so so Sci/Fi John boy in space)

Oddly enough in the latter two one actor played the same role in both.

I have also heard that the story was done by the Italians as a very bad
Gladiator flick but I don\'t know the title.

One key difference with the Pyramid playtest site is that everyone who goes
there has agreed to abide by a non-disclosure agreement, something that is
not a feature of TML membership.

I understood that this is as much to protect SJG from "you stole my idea"
lawsuits as anything else. It\'s the same reason that many publishing
companies have the "anything you submit becomes our property" clause in
their submissions guidelines.  If someone publishes a whole bunch of
designs on the TML, then SJG publishes very similar ones, that person could
accuse SJG of stealing their work. If the author (in this case Chris)
hasn\'t read the messages then theft hasn\'t occured (just plain old
simultaneous discovery).  Which is why Chris won\'t be reading the starship
messages here.

Well, you\'ve also got the problem that the baby is growing up inside a
maternal elephant, not a maternal mammoth. The effects of the mother can\'t
be ignored.

The best explanation of this I\'ve seen is in Figments of Reality (Stewart
and Cohen).  My Dad explained it to my too, but he lost me a lot faster...
(He sometimes forgets that I\'m not a PhD biologist.)

I could post a summary of this, but not quickly. Maybe our resident medico
could chip in? Robert?

For the Rebellion I also recommend the TNE book _Survival Margin_ as it
gives 15 years of TNS background material to use as handouts.

_Hard Times_ is also pretty good if you want to use a collapsing empire

Sorry for the delay in responding to this.  I wanted to talk to my Secret
Masters before I responded to it.  Rights become extremely complicated when
you consider the net as a publishing medium.  When you post it, you publish
it.  When you submit something that has been posted online to us, there is
_always_ legal issues.  If your future publisher has to wonder if he is
going to get sued or will have to sue, then your submission\'s survival is
in doubt.

I\'ve responded to your comments below.

An important thing to remember, is that the Line Editor sets the parameters
for future developments.  If Kromm or Loren told Chris "Do it this way,
don\'t do it that way", then Chris is bound to it.  If they said they want
people to directly submit stuff to Chris, rather than pointing Chris to
websites, then that is that.

That is great that IG felt that way, however considering various legal
issues that have cropped up involving SJ Games and also the entire
publishing industry in relation to the Internet, it isn\'t as cut and dried
as that.  SJ Games would like to legally cover their hiney while still
being able to let the online fan community flurish.

Exactly the same with Steve Jackson Games, however designs that have been
in the public domain aren\'t going to be given the same weight as one that
was developed and submitted.  The legal issues generally aren\'t worth the
hassles.  However, posting something online isn\'t a death sentance,
especially if you don\'t post your final submission to the net.

I don\'t think there is a problem with kicking around or fleshing out ideas
online, however if a near carbon copy of what you have posted in the public
domain is submitted to us, then our chance of accepting it is going to drop.

For SJ Games, the ideal situation is that an editor works with an author in
private and then the information is posted "publicly" in the Pyramid
playtest discussion.  For us, it is the ideal avenue for discussion as the
Editor, Line Editor, Author and everyone from SJ Games is paying attention
to THAT dissusion group, rather than the TML mailing list.   Now, if you
want to talk about the subject and run it by other people (say, the concept
of hydrogen factories in orbit of gas giants) before you submit your work,
then I don\'t think there is a problem.  If you cut and paste Leonard\'s
response into your final submission then expect SJ Games to be upset with you.

Yep.  Your work becomes SJ Games property, and thus falls under the rules
of the SJ Games Online Policy
(http://www.sjgames.com/general/online_policy.html).


>Is this the official SJG position: "We already have a forum, so we don\'t
>need to reference the TML, thank you"?

It has nothing to do with the TML.  We would treat any submission that was
pulled from rec.games.frp.gurps the exact same way.

I am a Chemical Engineer - which means I design chemical plants for a living.  
Most plants I design have large steam-raising systems, comparable to a large 
power station.  Assuming I wanted to set one of these to "self destruct" I 
could rig a plant like this to blow with remarkably limited preparation.  The 
main time would be taken up in walking between various key points:

(1) Go to store for relief valve "gags" (legal requirement for system testing)
(2) Climb to top of steam drum
(3) Fit "gags" onto relief valves (most of these fit over like a metal condom)
(4) Close key high pressure valves (e.g. vent and pressure-ruducing station).  
Note that this is unlikely to be noticed as all the steam is passing to a huge 
turbine.  The valves I close are the ones that normally protect the system in 
the event of a turbine trip.
(5) Trip the turbine [numerous methods]
(6) You now have one or two minutes before the major pressure vessels rupture.

If I wanted more time, I would probably open a lube oil drain.  It will take 
(say) 20 minutes for the oil level to fall to the point where the turbine would 
trip.  The lube oil system has only rudimentary instruments and the chances of 
someone identifying what I had done in time is quite small. [FX: pirate notices 
a pool of liquid on the floor.  Bending down he rubs some between his fingers 
and sniffs it.  The distinctive, to an Engineer, smell of jump coil coolant 
means nothing to the pirate, and he fails to raise the alarm ....]

On most chemical plants I could instead arrange to release a large cloud of 
flammable gas and then then ignite this via a choice of methods.

On many plants with a large furnace using liquid fuel, setting up a large fuel 
leak that will ignite when it reaches the furnace is very easy.

If I were Chief Engineer on a Starship I am sure I could rig up similar 
disasters tht would wreck the drives / whole ship, with a time delay of my 
choice.  The key step is to override safety systems (which on current 
technology needs an override for testing purposes).

I should also point out that it is possible to design around these sabotage 
routes, but this is only done on things like nuclear plants (and cyanide, 
you\'ll like to know) where the cost vs. safety equation is different.

If the ship has a missile launcher then the missiles would make fine scuttling
charges. Standard missiles are already fitted with timed self-destruct devices. 

For a really serious self destruct you could also fire a t-plate
missile at yourself (straight out for half an hour, then straight back down the
laser guide signal, as the ship wont be manoeuvring there will be no chance of a
miss and it\'s very easy to change your mind). 

You also better make sure the ship is in a stable orbit or heading out of
system, otherwise you might be in danger of breaking the near-c-rock accords.

Wrecking the ship is easy, as long as you have power; given the power output of standard traveller fusion reactors, all you need to do is disable some circuit breakers and reroute power for something which consumes a lot of power (drives, weapons, whatever) into the electronics.  A low quality version of this can be set up in under a minute, being thorough would take quite a bit longer.  For something a bit showier, overload the capacitors -- use the rules for an overloaded black globe generator.  If you don\'t have power, scuttling the ship is a bit harder, but as long as you have both life support and fuel, it isn\'t that hard, it just requires a hydrogen leak and a proper spark.  If you have missiles, they can reasonably be detonated; depending on what sort of missiles they are, this ranges from minor damage to complete destruction.

Aside from all those, simply locking the autopilot on a collision course with a large object will do the trick, though it is rather obvious.

	Yeah, well, I didn\'t say it would restore a full wild population.
Now, what you do is inbreed like crazy, toss in a dash of radiation
for some forced change, and keep culling the ones that don\'t work out
("McMammoth burger to go").

	As an example of this, Linux Journal just discovered that an article

	A brief selection from SMAD:

	SWRI 1750A, 16 bits, up to 512K, 1 MIP, 10 KRad hardness, used on
DS-1

	SWRI SC-5 (80C386/387), 32 bits, 320K, 0.6 MIPS, 10 KRad hardness,
used on RADARSAT

	Honeywell GVSC (1750A), 16 bits, up to 512 K, 1-3 MIPS, 1 MRad
hardness, used on NEAR and Clementine

	Lockheed Martin Rad6000 (IBM R/6000), 32 bits, up to 16G, 10-20
MIPS, 100KRad hardness, used on Mars Pathfinder

	As you can see, there\'s a fair variety out there. Actual selection
for a specific mission depends on many factors: how much processing
do you need, what kind of environment will you be in, how much
additional shielding can you fit, how much money do you have, what
heritage software do you plan to reuse, what processors are you
already familiar with, ...

	Not quite. More a matter of moving to a different semiconductor
technology, plus I suppose a few other tricks.

Why not just wait until the fertilized egg has divided a few times, treat it
with telomerase (to bring the telomeres back up to their full length and
thereby bringing the cell division limit back up to normal for a newborn)
and let it grow to adulthood without the early onset of aging diseases?

I\'m pretty sure that there was conscription into the Militia (_not_ the
AIF) during WWII.  I\'ll check today, when I wander past the town library. 
If I\'m wrong, I\'ll let you know.

Wow, you didn\'t do this until now?  I got as far as "Smash" (future beer,
with effects far more debilitating than real beer) before chucking the
whole thing as broken due to Mr. Pondsmith\'s heavy-handed sermonizing
("Drugs are Bad, Just Say No").  Oh well, it\'s his game; if he wants to put
deliberately crippled rules in it to discourage RL drug use, that\'s his call.

On a somewhat related note to the problem you found, a MURPHY\'S RULES
column in Pyramid Magazine pointed out that a Castle Falkenstein character
with good enough science skills can finish creating the simpler chemical
formulations weeks before he starts...

Keith, thanks for your comprehensive response to my query. It clarifies a
number of issues in regards to how SJG views things (I have read a couple
of your policies, but still had some q\'s!).

>An important thing to remember, is that the Line Editor sets
>the parameters for future developments.

I hadn\'t thought that the Ed. probably directed how submissions should be
sent! Doh! (The Editor\'s word is Law, L-A-W "Law", after all.)

It _was_ also a few years ago, I guess... and they were not around long
enough to hit any such problems?

This is that answer I expected to the next question:

Sorry, upon re-reading my question it sounds a bit petulant - I actually
meant "any online source other than our playtest area". Your reply has
answered that, and given a full explanation to boot.

Thanks for your excellent response! (BTW, can I publish this on my website
as "SJG\'s Official Position" - now that it\'s in the public domain, of
course!!! ;-) yes, that\'s only a slight dig! ;-) ;-)

after Vietnam, it was policy that Australian troops would not be used in any
overseas conflict other than "peace keeping operations." (although I believe
there was a caveat mentioning something to the effect of "until a period of
at least 50-years").  This was slightly broken when the RAN sent warships in
support of her American Allies and the Multi-national forces in the Middle
East against Sadam.  "Slightly broken" in the sense that Australia (as far
as the public are concerned) never took part in any actual fighting.
The Australian Armed Forces are basically a reactionary force in defence of
our home shores (and the most highly trained of these being north ender
reservists!).  Should the <insert possible Asian antagonists here> invade

the enemy) until our dear friends and allies, the Americans, come and help
us out logistically and with manpower as required.

Hey Roc, I\'m pretty sure conscription was introduced in Aust for WWII;
except it was done so with muchos trickery - to whit for \'home service\' etc
only. Home service just happened to start a few hundred miles above PNG
that\'s all (of course, it was out colony...). I can\'t comment on the rest
but suffice to say you\'re absolutely right, everything HAS changed.

And wasn\'t it weird to see lefties & hippies and all manner of your
traditional stock standard passive folk baying for military intervention RE:

suppressions?) to make palatable otherwise non tasty pulling up of britches

(it was too!) had an intel unit of one faction employing sociological
manipulation on a scale reminiscent of Foundation.

Accurate, cleanly written, to the point, and probably makes more sense than

>and email them to me? </on my hands and knees>

Don\'t you love it when they beg? ;-)

Well, I got home and looked for where I normally stored them, and guess
what - they were MISSING! (just like a lot of my Trav links - oh, never
mind...). So, I pulled the place apart looking for them, finding such
interesting items as an old set of flat (2D) cardboard cut-out grav tanks,
G-carriers, and enclosed air/rafts from Judges Guild! No, they are not
_called_ "G-carriers", or "air/rafts", but it\'s obvious what they are meant
to look like.

There is a happy ending, I found the Zhos, Imperial Marines, and
adventurer-types. The first two sets consist of three identical cardboard
sheets, only one of which I have cut out, so they should scan OK. The PC\'s
may take longer - all of them have been separated out, and I *think*
there\'s about 101 of them ("sit, Ubu, sit! No, wait til I close the cover!
No, don\'t move, you\'ll ruin the shot! Arrgh!! #$&^@*!!").

BTW [1] No, I hadn\'t realised how OOP these were - publishing date is
1982!!
[2] There is a site out there (can\'t remember whose) that has one set of
military figures on it as a picture file, set up in the same format as the
"Cardboard Heroes". The idea is to print them onto cardboard. If no-one
else can remember where these are, I\'ll try to locate them over the
weekend.

Mike Pondsmith has had direct and personal contact with the effects of the
drug culture.  He wanted to be damn sure that the drugs in CP were nasty
and not likely to become the focus of the adventure.

I got to paly in a game he ran at PacifiCon.. While doing an extraction
from the Honda-Ford building in Oakland, The Big One hits and levels the
complex.  H-F did a lot of testing in bioweapons and cyberpsychosis
treatments in that complex.

Yes, it was a dungeon crawl in the ruins!

BTW:  Remember when I posted that I had a chance to look at the G:T 2d
edition photocopy draft at CrescentCityCon in August of this year?  They
had made the same mistake.  When I pointed it out to Evil Stevie, he
asked me to watch the SJG booth for a few minutes, went directly to a
phone, and called the office to make sure that the book didn\'t go to
press that way.  I haven\'t seen G:T 2d edition in the store yet, so I
don\'t know whether this error was, in fact, caught in time.  Still, that
was definitely a tres cool thing for Steve Jackson to do, IMHO.

If someone can e-mail me a scan, I can see if it is, indeed, Arabic.  If
so, I might be able to translate it.

ObTrav:  Another aspect of Solomani culture that has Vilani historians
shaking their heads and wondering "Exactly _how_ did these Terran
upstarts manage to defeat us?"  [The answer, of course, is that a
society imaginative enough to produce entertainment about two lab mice
bent on global domination has the intellectual tools to defeat the
hidebound Vilani.  Besides, the genetic engineering that _produced_
Pinky and The Brain demonstrates the Terran lead in the biological
sciences.... ;-)]

This answers my second question, but not my first.  Will we have to
re-enter our data?

I\'m a poor college student now, so I have lots of time.  I can go with a
THUDDD a month.  Announce on or about the first of the month, allow
three weeks or so for entries, and a week for processing.  Then, as
voting begins on that THUDDD competition (about the first of the month),
announce the next one.  Repeat as desired.

I think it might make sense to add a list of core competencies, I mean,
I\'m currently a software education consultant, but I spent eleven years as
an Avionics Technician in the Air Force, so can both program, build and
fault-find everything from handheld radios to aircraft

Heck we could even use Traveller terminology, something like :

Electronics 2, Computer 3, Rifle 1, Instruction 1,

might describe me
(might need something to cover general aicraft maintenance as well, but what
the heck)

The question to ask is:  What does it mean to \'destroy\' a ship?  Is it
necessary to reduce it to plasma?  My guess is that it is not.  Rather,
the goal is to render it valueless to the enemy if captured, except
perhaps as scrap metal.  There are two facets to this:

1) Destruction of intelligence value
2) Destruction of material value

The first is easier.  It requires that the most useful intelligence data
aboard ship be kept in a few well-known locations -- specific safes and/or
memory stores -- and that these be rigged with individual explosive or
otherwise destructive charges sufficient to effectively vaporize them on
command.  A few kg of HE with the right design should suffice for this
purpose.

The second is obviously harder, but it can be done.  Make it possible to
deactivate all breaker boxes and the like, and send a few hairy spikes
through the electrical system; you\'ll burn out half the electronics and
set a few fires.  Use shaped charges to shatter the innards of e.g.
maneuver drives, jump drives, generic computer equipment, and so forth.
Do the same for hard-to-patch bulkhead junctions.  If there\'s a spinal
mount, knock it out of alignment and puncture it repeatedly.  Vent the
fuel tanks into the living spaces; you\'ll get a nice flash-explosion when
the H2 reaches your electical fires.  Time it so the hull breaches start
after this phase is done.  And so forth.

The end result, if you choreograph it right, is a ship which is still 95%
intact, but might as well be a large lump of crumpled beer cans as far as
its value to the enemy goes.

Needless to say, a good intel team sweeping the hulk will possibly luck
into some data not destroyed under part (1) above.  But it\'s all a game of
probabilities.

Btw, the reason Star Trek could credibly have an annihilate-the-ship
self-destruct option was their use of matter/antimatter drives.  With
fusion, you have to work very hard just to coerce your fuel into producing
energy.  With M/AM, you just turn off the magnetic bottle and blam, your
ship is suddenly a shell of plasma and high-energy photons.

Oh, one more thing:  All my HE-based tricks above are a last resort, if
you\'re in deep space or without maneuver capability.  Best way to lose a
ship is to dive it into a planet or asteroid at speed.  You\'d still want
to trash the intel just in case, but the material value is definitely
taken care of. :)

Maybe someday.  <g> For now, I just want a simple roster that people
can search to find fellow Travellers in their local areas.

I need to send a copy of the list to a couple of folks that asked
for it, too. That\'s for this weekend.

If someone hasn\'t answered this already, here\'s my take on Vinge\'s
Singularity...

The author Venor Vinge postulates that the advance of technology is
accelerating at such a rate that a point will be reached in a few
years where mankind\'s capabilities will be beyond our current
ability to understand.  This will be, Vinge suggests, a
social/cultural/technological singularity.

Vinge has written several books where he speculates at a post
singularity society, "The Peace War" was serialized in Analog back
in the early 80\'s, and expanded in a novel and a sequel.  The thing
is, Vinge\'s protagonists are all pre-sigularity individuals that
find some way to transistion past it, *they* are understandable.

It will blow the internal contents of the hull into scrap. That should
deny them to anyone else, shouldn\'t it?
(15 X 1400 = 21 tonnes of explosive for your Type S - should do quite a
bit of internal damage...)

Craig Berry has discussed this point quite eloquently.

Let\'s back-track a bit. The nuclear transfer technique has a failure
rate IIRC of 60-80%. Hopefully enough viable mammoth cell nuclei can be
harvested.

Then the elephant egg needs to be placed. I\'m not up-to-date on the
status of gamete/zygote intra-fallopian transfer in elephants.
Techniques used on cattle and horses may be adequate.

Will the nuclei harvested have normal chromosomes?
Will placentation occur? If the maternal immune response is not
appropriately modulated, rejection will take place.

How different are mammoth growth factors from elephant ones? They\'re
probably very similar, but there may be unforeseen effects arising from
the differences. Both mother and foetus \'signal\' hormonally throughout
gestation.

Assuming the pregnancy gets to term, what happens after? Will mother
recognise its child?

>From a species standpoint, not at lot can be done about inbreeding at
this point in time, until homologous recombination techniques are
perfected in higher eukaryotes (as well as sequencing their genomes).
(Gene therapy trials have failed largely because expression of the
implanted genes has been inadequate. It would appear that they need to
be inserted into the genome where their defective counterparts are
located, not randomly - which is the current state of the art).

Chris S. : this is one reason why \'uplifting\' animals is TL 14 voodoo,
rather than TL 9 - in the absence of reliable nanopore based high speed
DNA sequencing, and another Charles Darwin or three.

If telomerase is the only \'division counter\' for cells (still a big
maybe), resetting it after \'a few divisions\' will get leave you multiple
copies of the first cell, won\'t it?

This may help you with cloning, but have no effect on the subsequent
development of the organism(s).

The telomere theory of aging has been largely discredited - it was the
\'magic bullet of aging\' for the 1990\'s. Other factors are at play.

Ahh, if the problem was that easy to solve....

Been and done.  Yes, part of the Australian Military Forces (AMF) was
conscripted.  The AMF was basically the pre-war militia, massively
expanded.  They were only authorised to serve in Australia and New Guinea,
although this was somewhat relaxed in about \'43 or so, *after the crisis
period*, in order to convince the US that Australia was still pulling its
weight.  This was the same kind of process that led to the strategically
dubiously useful Tarakan campaign.

The Australian Imperial Forces (actually, the 2nd AIF, the first being the
WWI force), was an all volunteer group.  The pre-war regulars seem to have
been absorbed as cadres into both the AMF and AIF.

OBTRAV:  Planet Vegemite mobilises.  It raises a picked volunteer force for
Imperial service, and simultaneously massively expands its planetary forces
to protect its own system.  Later in the war, it changes its laws to allow
its forces to serve anywhere in its own subsector.  This is essentially a
political maneuver, to make the Imperium happy.

Yeah, this was weird.  I was watching the resulting bunfight on various
political mailing lists.  Phew!  Trust me - we _don\'t_ have flamewars. 
This was in the circles for which the following comment _isn\'t_ a joke:
> > The Australian Armed Forces are basically a reactionary force

> Da, Tovarisch!
 
The main thing seemed to be that the East Timorese Resistance were the ones
who called for the intervention.  This meant that the lefties closest to
them chose to go along with it.  Others didn\'t, and chucked a major nasty
at those who did.

Of course, it\'s useful to remember that most lefties aren\'t pacifists, and
are quite happy to support "just" wars.  In particular, they were
supporting the Timorese guerillas during the decades the Australian army
was training the Indonesian army....

OBTRAV:  The Ine Givar have been supporting a revolt for years.  For
various reasons, the Imperial government has changed from backing the
oppressive government, to supporting the rebels, and are preparing to send
in the troops.  The IG is split between factions that are prepared to
accept the intervention, and those preparing to change sides and support
their former enemies against their former allies.

Oh, and one last thought - my father was a \'Nasho\' (National Serviceman). 
This must have been before 1961, and would probably have been late 50s. 
This was _before_ the main US involvement in Vietnam.  Weird.  I\'ll have to
check the dates.  It\'s got no relevance to Traveller, though.

This thread is a bit too "real world politics" and not Traveller enough.  I
think I\'m going to leave it alone from now on.

It was fun too, I played the brains behind a hot rock star "Hunter Killer"
whose latest single "Stand and Fight" was rocketing up the charts. I had to
make him decide to stay behind while the rest of us got off planet. Although
the fool was scared of the aliens, he was even more scared of losing face in
front of his fans, so I managed to manuever him into announcing live that he
would live up to his song and "Stand & Fight". Everything went according to
plan, except I did too well, and managed to convince someone I wanted to
come with us to stay behind too. Damn. Ah well, can always find another
one...

Y\'know, that\'s not far off the actual scenario....
<grin>
though no cloning was involved, you don\'t think crashing into the pacific
ocean is enough to kill an alien do you ?

In the first build-up event, it was the octopus alien that was the scariest,
and as things got worse, well,  imagine John Wyndham\'s book "The Kraken
Wakes", but with Aliens doing the harvesting.

In a nutshell:  What typical kinds of atmospheric composition would make

I\'ve seen it stated somewhere (probably in tne or gt or both) that B/C
Type atmospheres both contain stuff like methane, ammonia, hydrogen,
etc. So I\'m trying to understand how those chemicals would react one way
to cause B Type atmospheres and a different way to cause C Type
atmospheres. This got stuck in my head while I was fleshing out some
details on Frond/Sp March 0810 E9C3300-9 Lo nIn Fl  103Cs  F8V. I had a
copy of the Nyotekundu Sourcebook from 2300 and I thought (please
correct me if I\'m wrong) that the planet Inferno seemed to be a good
example of a Type C atmosphere. So I try to check what it said about
Inferno\'s atmosphere against the Traveller standard atmosphere types.
Somewhere (again probably tne or gt) it says that both B/C atmospheres
have these kinds of chemicals. So, what would make them require
protective suits in type B and what would make those same chemicals
cause protective suits to fail in type C?

Oh yeah, Frond is not a Fjord but I have no idea what it has to do with

I suspect that the problem is the "treat with teleomerase" part.

I was thinking of a rather more extreme blast. With a coal fired plant,
especially the modern one that use powered coal in fluidized bed
burners, you should be able to get a near nuclear level explosion.
"All" you need to do is rig blowers that\'ll mix enough coal dust with
enough air. Provide an ignition source and there won\'t be anymore plant.

That\'s one of the messier ways to cause a power substation to
self-destruct. Arrange a coolant leak for one of the big transformers.
Thermal runaway occurs shortly thereafter, and the transformer explodes
most spectacularly. 

Hmmm. That might work onboard a ship.

From what I gather from what I read, we *still* can\'t beat the Hayflick Limit.

It pays to keep in mind that the "singularity" isn\'t going to be much
like Vinge\'s (lack of) description.

The whole *concept* of the singularity is that you reach a point where
the changes combine to make the resulting world/culture completely
incomprehensible to anyone from before that point. 

Consider that it\'s arguable that we\'ve already had a few singularities.
As well as a *lot of "partial singularities". 

Language is one. Civilization may be another.

Writing and some technological advances are "partials".

It\'s based on a concept from some of Vernor Vinge\'s SF. Check out the
combined volume "Across Realtime". 

The basic idea is that given some fairly "simple" assumptions, it seems
inevitable that technology and society will interact faster and
stranger until a point is reached at which it\'s no longer possible to
predict (or understand) the result. 

He called it a singularity for the same reason the center of a black
hole is a singlarity. It\'s a point where the rules quit working and
just tell you "you\'re on your own". And in math, such points are
"singularities". 

As I recall, an X-Y graph of tangent versus angle has singluraitie ever
180 or 360 degrees (I forget which). From one side of the "line" the
function is rapidly approaching positive infinity as a limit. From the
other side the function is rapidly approaching *negative* infinity as a
limit. So what value *does* it have *at* the line? :-)

Anyway, in practical terms, at some point in the relatively *near*
future, unless we hit a major unsuspected barrier or two, life will be
so different that we *can\'t* imagine it. 

Don\'t get too worried though. "Near" could be 30 years, or it could be
300 years. It\'s unlikely to be much sooner or much later. 

Someone once tried to point out the problems of playing in even
*foreseeable* "highly advanced" futures. His example was Romans trying
to play an RPG set in the present. 

A few of the examples I recall involved things like having to point out
that they *could* get to someplace 30 miles away easily. It\'d only take
a few minutes in an automobile, rather than hours in a chariot. And that
they could *talk* to people hundreds of miles away. 

The point was that not only were these "common" background items things
the players would have to be informed of and *learn* to take into
account in play, but that these were things that the *characters*
weren\'t supposed to give a second thought to. 

There\'s only so far you can go before the players aren\'t able to react
"properly" for the background. If they have to stop and think before
going "Oh yeah, I can just make a phone call" or "Gee, do you suppose
there was a security camera that caught that?" then they can\'t *really*
play the role, because it\'s just too *different*.

Dunno if this NEW-YORKER-style cartoon actually exists, or if I\'ve just
vividly imagined it:

Two nearly-naked spear-carrying Bushmen are eyeing a chicken that has
somehow made its way onto the veldt.  One assures the other, "Trust me,

I\'d heard just the opposite. With the clincher being Dolly the sheep

maturity.

Well, knowing that the problem is at least *partly* loss of the
teleomeres from the DNA strands is helpful. But figuring out how to
*restore* them is quite a different matter. Especially since doing it
wrong is guaranteed to cause cancer.

I *am* reminded of the regen technique invented by E.E.Smith in "Gray
Lensman". It\'d regen everything, right down to replacing missing adult
teeth. But the replaced soft tissues were appropriately "old" (ie
wrinkled skin, gray hair, etc). Teleomeres give a "sufficient" reason
for that.

The main difference I\'d give things is that Type B is corrosive. That
is, it *degrades* (corrodes, dissolves, rusts) things exposed to it. 

Type C doesn\'t (and IMO *shouldn\'t) corrode things. But it, or at least
some troublesome component is *really* hard to keep out of suits,
vehicles and habitats. 

For example, helium is very insidious. It\'s a single atome "molecule",
and is darn small. It\'ll seep thru "airtight" seals. Even ones that
will hold air against vacuum. 

Luckily, helium doesn\'t do much worse than make your voice squeaky.
Right? 

Well, it depends on your technology. If you\'ve got tube based tech, and
a moderately high partial pressure of helium in the atmosphere, the
helium will leak into the tubes and ruin them. Even *now* this is a
problem in deepsea habitats. You see, most displays are still big
vacuum tubes. :-)

Hydrogen is almost as bad. In fact, under some conditions, hydrogen is
*worse*. That\'s because there are a number of metals that hydrogen will
seep through! The metals can store H inside their molecular structure,
and thus give a sheet of such a metal with H on one side and no H on
the other, the H will seep into the metal, and slowly diffuse into it.
And as soon as it\'s diffused to the far side, it\'ll start seeping *out*
of the metal. 

This can be hazardous two ways. First, the H is a fire hazard in an
oxygen atmosphere. Though it\'ll take a while to build up to hazardous
levels. But a bigger danger is that once the metal has absorbed a not
that large amount of H, it will become *brittle*!

Titanium has lots of nasty problems if it absorbs H. It can be almost
as brittle as *glass*. Titanium metal that has been shaped in certain
ways (mostly "cold", ductile forming) will tend to try to revert to
it\'s unformed state. 

It\'s an extreme case. But *most* metals get brittle with enough
absorbed H.

Planets with lots of Helium or Hydrogen in the atmosphere will be rare.
And, as you can see, they *deserve* the "insidious" rating.

Carbon monoxide can seep thru metal also, but it\'s harder. Apparently
is passes thru red hot iron *readily*. No need to point out what
happens if CO gets into the ship or suit. 

For purely "inorganic" insidious hazards, it takes *very* simple
molecules. I can\'t think of any others at the moment. 

But things like fine dusts can also be insidious. For example, a planet
with a lot of fine dust in the air, where the dust either contains
beryllium (a very toxic light element) or some heavy metals (lead,
arsenic, gold, etc) is just as dangerous. Especially since these metals
tend to stay in the body unless special treatments are used to remove
them. And in the case of beryllium, I don\'t *know* of any means of
getting it out of the body. 

There\'s an Asimov short story dealing with a world with a high
beryllium content. An expidition is trying to figure out why a colony
attempt long ago had failed (in Traveller terms, it\'d been colonized
before the Long Night, and failed when the colonist died of mysterious
maladies). One of the members of the expedition finally connects a
geological report with an old book he\'d read (he\'s got an eidetic
memory, but isn\'t very smart).

The (quite reasonable) logic is that while beryllium is *useful* for a
lot of things, it\'s so toxic that there\'s a lot of pressure to find
substitutes that *don\'t* use beryllium. So, over the centuries, the
warnings about its toxicity have gotten lost. This *could* happen even
in the Traveller universe. 

Another nasty chemical type "insidious" agent is mercury vapor. Get
much of that in the air and you\'d better pray you\'ve got *good*
filters. 

Then we get into things like airborne viruses and prions. Stuff that\'s
only a few hundred or thousand atoms, but if it gets into a living
organism, it can trick the organism into replicating it, and the cost
of interfering with normal functions or even damaging the organism.

Virii and prions are *hard* to deal with because unlike bacteria, they
aren\'t "alive" in the common sense. With bacteria, you can simply
supply simple chemicals as food and the right sort of air, heat and
humidity, and the bacteria will reproduce. 

With virii and prions, you have to provide lots and lots of
*compatible*, but easily infected cells. And somehow keep all these
cells alive while making it easy for the viruii or prions to reproduce.

And even then, the only way you can be sure you\'ve managed to culture
them is to see if an extract from the culture will infect people (or if
you are lucky, a lab animal that is also susceptible to the disease). 

It\'s unlikely to be practical, even at high Traveller tech levels to
seperate and examine every different type of molecule in the air sample
or the culture. So it\'ll take a *long* time to get a pure sample of the
agent.

See all my stuff above. Corrosive stuff "eats" at things. Insidious
either leaks thru stuff that other things *can\'t* leak thru, or in the
case of biologicals, it\'s able to reproduce, so that just *one* virus,
prion, or bacterium getting past your precautions can result in
sickness or an epidemic.

With bio hazards, the problem is that because of the "it only takes
one" problem, and an individual organism being so small, the
precautions required to prevent stuff from getting where it isn\'t
wanted get pretty involved. Read up on biohazard lab rules. 

But lets take at least a first cut at it. The planet has an "insidious"
rating because in spite of normal precautions, the first ship to land
had the entire crew wiped out by what is thought to be an unknown
disease. 

Basicly, someone went out in a sealed suit, *something* got on it, or
floated into the airlock, and survived the normal "disinfectant" shower
(read that as something not *quite* corrosive enough to damage the suit
or airlock). And then managed to get from the inner lock area (where
the suit was hung) into the living areas. And then discovered that the
crew made adequate "culture media" for reproduction.

Until IDed, and possibly long after if a treatment isn\'t come up with,
you\'ll have to take some really extraordinary precautions when dealing
with that planet.

Oh yeah, it occurs to me that planets that are sufficiently
radioactive as to require protective gear would also be a likely to be
lumped under "insidious". 

Hopefully, I\'ve gotten your imagination sparking away now. :-)

One of my favorite CT sources was the Spinward Marches  Campaign.
Basically, you get the Spinward  Marches  sector  (if  you  don\'t
already have a copy), details of the Fifth  Frontier  War  (which
fleets  are  where  at  what   times,   some   key   events   and
personalities, etc ... a  great  backdrop  for  a  campaign),  an
Imperial Batron detailed, an adventure, and more.  Back  this  up
with Traveller News Service stories of the  time  (which  can  be
found on the net), and four LBB supplements:  Library  Data  A-M,
Library Data N-Z, Traders and Gunboats, and Fighting Ships.

On a larger budget you could also  get  the  Fifth  Frontier  War
boardgame and mine that for info but its not necessary.

I asked my dad!  There was "National Service" in Australia from about 1952
to 1960, but it was compulsory membership in the Reserves (CMF). 
Basically, it was three months full time, 6 if you were in the Navy or Air
Force, followed by a couple of years in the Reserves.  Or something like
that - I may have garbled the details.  I suppose it gives you a certain
number of partly trained people, so it\'s not *quite* entirely useless.

"Real" conscription was introduced after the old Nasho was eliminated, but
not too long after - a year or two, I gather.  This, of course, was to
provide troops for Vietnam.

OBTRAV:  Hell, I dunno.  I said this was going to be my last post on the
thread, didn\'t I?  Umm, ways to keep an Army going on the cheap.  Reasons
why some worlds need to hire Mercs occasionally, in the absence of a decent
sized pool of properly trained and equipped people.

Since "insidious" is defined in the rules as defeating protective suits

planet qualify as an insidious atmosphere?

A vacc suit\'s temperature regulation gear must have some limit to
how long it can stand up to a furnace atmosphere, especially if there\'s
no "dark side" to dump heat into. Specialized buildings, vehicles and
even some suits may fare better, of course.

Just a thought inspired by another thread and someone\'s recent comment
about a list of MT tasks: how about a task library which would even resolve
the task for you on demand?  Ideally, it would let you add your own tasks
too.

In the meantime, I\'ve been thinking about going through the MT books to
collect all the tasks given.  But before I reinvent the wheel has anyone
done this and would like to share the work?

Computer-3, Admin-1, Swimming-2, Brawling-1, Wheeled Vehicle-1,
Science (Biology)-1, Medic-1, Instruction-1, Survival-0, Carbine-0,

I\'m a computer system manager, currently running Windows NT servers 
and PC-based computer labs for a liberal arts college. I worked my way up 
to the position from a long list of computer jobs ranging from selling them to 
running a help desk to doing field support. In the process, I\'ve had to 
organize quite a few projects with at least small groups of people in them. 
the Brawling skill comes from a year of karate training, the Instruction skill 
from a year as a substitute high-school teacher, a year of university-level 
science teacher training courses, and running countless computer skills 
seminars over the years. The Biology comes from college courses (it 
probably used to be higher, but I left the field before really getting into it). 
The Swimming and Medic skills are leftover from my experience with the 
Boy Scouts of America, as are my familiarities with Survival, Carbine and 
Bow.

If you add my couple decades of gaming experience, maybe you could
work in some familiarity with Tactics skill...<G>

Terribly! 

There is a show on the Cartoon Channel called \'Road Rovers\'. The episode
on last Sunday featured the return of one of their long running
villains. 

In the end he was thrown in the loony bin, next to a cell containing an
earlier villain in the series. They fell to arguing "I\'m going to rule
the world" "No I\'M going to rule the world!"

At the very end, a familiar voice rings out from farther down the hall
"No, it is I, Brain, who will rule the world!"

The camera pans out and dang if the loony bin doesn\'t look just like the
back side of Acme Labs....<snif>

Having just completed some process plant trials in which the commissionong
team didn\'t check everything....

Traveller ships tend to use the computers (pre-TNE) for everything. Say
that the destruct sequence is coded in the computer (either local or main).
It\'s one of the few things that the people commissioning the ship won\'t
test fully <grin>.

So the players start the sequence and the ship doesn\'t detonate. The code
is wrong, or there is a glitch.. Do they go back on board? What if they
need a ship and they were destroying it for a different reason. And if they
reboard it, will it suddenly go \'boom\'? Or, why did they get that salvaged
ship so cheaply...

I feel evil :-)

Dave,

Please can you post a review if you have a minute? Basically, I\'m
interested in how \'heavy\' the book gets. Is it an overview or are we
talking of pages of equations? I\'m an engineer, but I don\'t tend to go as
gear headed in game as real life. I\'m wondering how much use it would be to
a non-/mildly gearheaded GM.

Cheers,

There\'s two levels of (2) also.  You can make it short-term valueless (i.e. you can\'t use it, but a couple months in a shipyard and it can be salvaged) or completely valueless (in which case it\'s a hunk of metal floating in space).

I think thermite is favored here.  HE is more likely to scatter and shatter material than to vaporize it.  Within a traveller setting, a tiny plasma charge will do the job nicely.

Note that this is sufficient for the first type of destruction of material value noted above.

Hmm.

Ine Givar = IG = terrorist organisation against the Third Imperium
Imperium Games = IG = terrorist organisation against the works that

Hmm.

I would imagine that it is probably a factor that when your company is
raided by the Secret Service, you tend to be a bit more on the ball when it
comes to legal issues.

Sure.  As long as you keep in mind that this is subject to change.  On the
whole, I think SJ Games is not going to be very tyrannical about
pre-submission posts online, but if my Secret Masters ever notice these
sorts of problems cropping up more frequently, expect the policy or SJ
Games attitude towards online material to change. :(

Another place to check out is Microtactix and their cardstock buildings.
They have been putting out fantasy buildings (Vyllage-on-the-Cheep), but
have recently released Starbase Omega 3, a sci-fi set.  They are in 25mm
scale, and have some figures exactly in the same format as 
Cardboard Heroes.  Here is the URL for the sci-fi set:

	I also just conjured from my own imagination.  Last night
	I was unable to find my notes, but I remember it being
	composed of about 90% 0.1 mm units, 9% 1 mm units, and
	1% 10 mm units.  These could, of course, be combined into
	larger, more complex units within the robot.  I had it
	able to mimic forms that it knew, including bones, muscles,
	etc., but colour and texture were imperfect: touching or
	even seeing the robot from up close would give it away.
	It was less strong than an equivelent mechanical robot
	(something like Str 20-25), and unarmoured.  Slugs and
	explosives did no appreciable damage, but damage over 10
	slowed it, and damage over 20 stunned it.  Hand-to-hand or
	bow damage over 20 would also slow it.  Lasers and high
	energy weapons did one point per die, but it could turn
	reflective for protection similar to ablat armour.  All 
	damage came off Str, and reflected lost usable mass as 
	well.  On the subject of mass, it could incorporate items
	into itself, such as amputated fingers (for a fingerprint,
	until it started to rot), an autopistol (for a surprise),
	or even an air space to increase volume.  Not as nasty as
	the one from T2, but still a handful for your average PCs.

In GT 2/e, the cost of manuever modules has more than doubled at TL12
(MCr 0.65/module, I think). I\'ll check on the rest of the stuff tonight (I 
did the design by hand, then on a spreadsheet). I may have just forgot to 
include a module or two in the description.

Not really; the patrol cruiser is more for police than military duty. Note 
that the SDB can\'t take a hit from its weaponry, either.

Forgot about that ;) Not really a problem for military use, since another 
ship would be required to carry the unit\'s equipment.

Actually, I\'ve heard that while Dolly has shorter telomere molecules, but
that there has so far been no evidence that she or any other clones are
aging more rapidly.  Not knowing much about sheep, I\'ve no idea when such
proof would likely show up.  I\'d imagine we\'d know in 5 years or so.  So,
can anyone confirm of deny the veracity of what I\'ve heard?

Personally, my definition of Space Opera has always been the need for 
fighters to bank in space :)  Thus, Star Wars and Battlestar Galactica are 
space opera.  Star Trek, in all it\'s incarnations, doesn\'t have fighters, 
hence it\'s not space opera.  B5\'s fighters don\'t bank in space, so it\'s not 
sepace opera either.

advanncement is continuing to increase (a fact which may slow down and so
avoid any type of singularity) but that the current explosion in biotech
and electronics may result in the creation of beings that are
substantially more intelligent than humans.  We might have genetically
engineers supergeniuses, humans with massive mental cyberware, or 
hyperintelligent AI computers. 

If any such beings end up existing then suddenly the future becomes
completely unpredicatable, since such individuals will understand the
world in a fashion which we cannot grasp.  What would a being that was
more intelligent than the smartest human and capable of thinking 100 times
as fast be able to do?  What would a society run be such beings or perhaps
composes of such beings be like?  We have no clue...  That\'s what the
singularity is about.  Vinge has an excellent essay about this on the web. 

So long as merely human intellects are involved, tech may change rapidly,
but will never go completely off the scale, since humans can (to some
degree) understand and deal with anything humans can create.  If we
suddenly have superintelligent beings than all bets are off. 

Given that in the last few years geneticists have identified a gene
sequence for memory that can be used to allow mice to learn faster, and
medical electronics folks have made a (*really* primitive*) direct neural
interface (move a cursor by thought) I\'m betting on intelligence enhanced
humans within the next 40 or 50 years.  I hope the process can be
retrofitted, since I\'d sure like to become such a being. 

Actual non-biological AI seems more difficult, but I\'m not willing to be
what computers will be like in 50 years, given that there were no
computers 50 years ago.

Dunno if you are familiar with GT, but any support programs for that, and 
for GURPS in general would be greatly appreciated....

How about a good time-tracking program?  One that lets you set the year and 
date, and track dates, but could also zoom in to trck hours and even 
minutes, if needed.  This could be linked to a sector map program so that 
you could say "on 015-1120 we left, via Jump 4, from Regina to 
Entrope".  It would then calculate the time to do so, allowing you to 
insert delays during intermittent stops.

can use several forms on the same data if we want to - maybe a character

Top of the list - E.C. Tubb\'s Dumarest Saga. It has virtually all the
elements of the game in the stories as it is. High, Middle and Low passages,
primitive and high tech weapons, worlds with widely varying tech levels and
different government styles, aristocratic rulers, mysterious organisations
(the Cyclan) relying on powers of the mind, hidden and lost worlds, the
heresy that all humans came from one planet (the Solomani Heresy). And, of
course, the central characters in the stories are named as - you guessed
it - Travellers.

Next on the list would be Jack Vance\'s many stories, though perhaps not the
Demon Princes. They seem to fill in all the remaining gaps - interstellar
empires, vast disorganised government between the stars with local
organisations on the planet surface.

Anyone care to suggest any others? Better yet, anyone who really knows the
answer like to tell us?

From what I\'ve heard, sheep have no notable external signs of aging which would show up on a clone (such things as teeth wear aren\'t going to be affected), so yes, several years before anyone knows.  Of course, also evidence that Dolly isn\'t a perfect clone anyway, if nothing else there\'s different mitochrondrial DNA.

IIRC, somebody on this list posted, many years ago, that Marc and Loren thought
of Traveller after seeing Star Wars for the first time.

I\'ve always thought that was cool, since I knew I wanted to find and play a
sci-fi RPG after seeing The Empire Strikes Back (I didn\'t know what RPGs were
when Star Wars was in theatres).

My memory might be off though -- feel free to correct me if you know better.

I don\'t have it.  =)  I\'m trying to figure out what my skills would be and
whether or not they\'d be useful in any TU.  I have a Master\'s Degree in
Medieval History specializing in the occult, early science, mysticism,
religion and women\'s issues.  I was once disallowed as a Cthulhu Now
character (too powerful!) but I think all I have in terms of Traveller is
Computer-1, Firearms-0, Streetwise-1, Seduction, stuff like that...

more appropriate honor would be to have a class of scout ships -
perhaps an \'upgraded\' successor to the Donosev class survey ship
- - named after him instead.  Certainly, Andy was more of a pioneer
than a warrior in the realm of Traveller.

Yup. This is one of the items used as insidious in WBH.

Another good option is a flourine atmosphere. You get things like

What you are forgetting is the most inherent and naturally limiting factor :
Humans themselves.  The main distribution of people aren\'t very intelligent
at all yet occupy most of the niches needed to push technologies to change
humanity.  and these same people will fight change and do fight it.  The
larger the changes, the more they fight it.  Why else is NASA and other
needed agencies relegated a level of importance equal to watching cars go
down the freeway, as far as Senators and other influential people are
concerned, when it comes to divvying out the funds?

You then tell these people that this or that is going to change their
children or themselves physically and you\'ll have a near panic on your hands
and the typical political knee-jerk reaction of covering it up and brushing
it under the carpet.  Were it not for short-sighted people in power, we
would already have an international space station, a colony on the moon,
industry in orbit and possibly a colony on Mars as well.  Sure technology is
moving fast, but that\'s mainly research.  Implementation (unless it stands
to make someone very rich or powerful) seems to drag slow as molasses in
January.

The cruiser should have 4 fuel processors, not 2; this accounts for the two 
"missing" spaces.

Also, the cruiser can take 26 "average" hits from a TL 12 laser before being 
reduced to 0 HP.

The danger is that without understanding, we would judge, and in judging,
would condemn.

Too much belief in absolutes and ideals, not enough flexibility.

As intelligence in all species is influenced _directly_ by information
processing power, and that this is directly influenced im turn by the amount
of visual and audio signal proceesing a species of brain does, _capability_
for intelligence is almost completely determined by DNA.

What people forget is that the "environment" part excercises the processing
equipment that is in place and builds the neural net. It does not directly
affect the capability for intelligence of the person, it merely gives them
more experiences, making them better able to function in human society and
_seem_ more intelligent that a superior processing unit deprived of
information or communiction skills.

An analogy is that two identical CPU\'s could be used in two machines, one
might control a refrigerator\'s temperature, the other is designed and
programed to interact with humans using language and visual signs, helping
them do some task.

Anyone interacting with the second CPU without being told it\'s the same as
the first, would conclude the second was more "intelligent"..

"Genetically", i.e hardware-wise , it isn\'t.

It may not be. the basic requitrements are as simple as a physical trait,
size of particular sections of the brain, average level of a particular
neuro-chemical in the inter-nueron gap,  that sort of thing

Though figuring out which combinatuions are best, may be difficult if the
best combination is one that no individual has yet exhibited.

Why not ? _Iff_ we had sufficient understanding of the sequencing, it would
be illogical not to make use of that information to better yourself and the
species, would it not ?

Of course, one would, if one wanted to be a "nice" person,  have to allow
individuals to choose whether they wantd to be involved in the process, and
allow them to hide out in their little backwater,

But for some reason, that seems more religious or hysterical than anything
else,  lots of people don\'t like the idea of genetic engineering, look at
all the fuss in the UK where they\'ve even banned (or tried to ban, more
like) genetically modified foods, forgeting that all the food they\'ve been
eating for centuries is already genetically modified. There\'s even people
trying to get that done over here in New Zealand.

Yes, this was demonstrated, though not so much by "thought" as by
concentrating on producing a particular sort of brain activity.

Hey, we don\'t need brainiac to see that morality _is_ silly
unless you\'re the one controlling what the current morality is.
<grin>

The problem is not really that "higher intelligences" may see the world in a
different way, but that humans have this terrible desire to enforce their
own way of seeing things on other people and things, and not accepting
other\'s ways of seeing things.

The only way we can handle the future is by begining to practice seeing
things in different ways, and to realize that we _need_ to see things in
diferent ways at different times and in different situations.

RPG\'s help with that,.

A few thoughts

This is true, people who don\'t like computer intellligence keep redefining
what intelligence is to deny computer capabilities. Their latest, and
probably most interesting, attempt at redefining it, is "emotional"
intelligence.

Currently, computers can out perform humans in all quantative measures of
human intelligence, except perhaps inductive reasoning and some random
information retrrieval but they don\'t exhibit "original thought".

One possibility is that original thought may not actually be neccessary for
us to be fooled into thinking something is "intelligent". The converse is
that anything we can\'t communicate with is considered "un-intelligent"
unless it shows us some fancy technological tricks.

People who can\'t communicate well are considered un-intelligent, the
foreigner who can\'t speak English is derided as stupid, etc.

Intelligence is, like beauty, in the mind of the beholder.

Wrong!

TOS didn\'t have fighters, true (unless you count Starfleet Battles).
Neither did TNG, except for a brief glimpse of a squadron of small ships
wiped out by a Borg cube.

Later DS9 episodes and VOYAGER, however, have repeatedly shown craft of
fighter size and purpose (first the Maquis ships, then others).  And boy,
do they bank.  So do the bigger ships, if you look closely.  I could
provide episode cites, but that would require me to watch VOYAGER,
something I find almost physically painful most of the time.

STAR TREK is definitely space opera.  B5, however, is a trickier subject.
I\'ll leave that to someone else.

Ah, that explains it.  I don\'t watch either DS9 or Voyager, although I was 
a big fan of TOS and TNG....


>STAR TREK is definitely space opera.
More like space soap opera :)  seriously though, I am a big fan of the 
first two series (including the even-numbered movies), and I wouldn\'t 
consider then Space Opera (yes, the big ships do bank, but for my 
definition it\'s _fighters_ that must bank).  It\'s quite possible that the 
two later series are more Space Opera-ish, but I don\'t watch them, so I 
couldn\'t say.


>   B5, however, is a trickier subject.

IMHO, B5 is fairly hard sci-fi (ships have inertia, must rotate in order to 
change course), and thus not Space Opera.  In the same vein, I don\'t 
consider Traveller to be Space Opera.

Canon is pretty clear on how many there are of the highest ranks of the
Imperial nobility -- one duke per subsector, a count for every two or three
worlds, a marquis for every single important world.

Meanwhile, the baronage is the main pool from which the upper ranks
of Imperial bureaucracy are drawn.  There must be a lot of barons, since
the Imperium has a huge population to be administered.  How many?

My gut feeling is that there is probably at least one baron per self-
governing planet, no matter how unimportant -- and about one baron
per 20-50 million people on a high-population world.  I can\'t see the
Emperor having to keep track of more than that (such a figure already
implies *millions* of barons in the Imperium as a whole).  But I\'m
willing to be convinced that my estimate is off by a factor of 10
either way.

Any insights?  And yes, this is going into a book for GT if possible.

Sure profits and utility drive tech.  However, having a superintelligent
being o r two around is seriously going to boost profits of almost any
company with a significant R&D division. I\'d imagine most governments
would like one too.  Also, lots of folks will want to be smarter.  The
problem with Mars colonies and such like is they cost *lots* of money and
only benefit the very few who go there.  While I\'m a big fan of getting us
into space, we can\'t do it on any large scale until things become a whole
lot cheaper.  With current prices to orbit, orbital industry is simply too
expensive. 

As for research vs. implementation.  I don\'t see it that way at all.
Within the past 5 years there has been: 

Cloning, growing functional, implantable organs in vats, gene therapy,
vastly improved computers, DVD movies, & cell phones in the hands of 30%
of first world people.  All these things have been commercially used. 
Sure, once you get outside of medicine, biotech, and electronics the
number of advances decreases significantly, but we\'re doing *astoundingly*
well in those areas. 

Pick up any recent issue of Popular Science magazine and flip through it. 
The stuff just coming on the market looks more advanced than most 70s SF. 
Sure, there\'s no antigravity or jump drives, but my guess is that those
things are impossible, or at best only possible for post-singularity
civilizations. 

Practical commercially used technology is changing faster than ever.
However, it\'s not doing so in any of the ways folks thought about in the
40s-70s (fusion, spaceships...).

Whether this reflects more on the community or on Vinge\'s work I leave to
others.  =)  In any case, it\'s not something that the scientific community,
philosophical or working, accepts as a whole, or even as a significant
fraction as best I can tell given my current position outside of anyplace
where the relevant journals are likely to be circulated.  It\'s a source of
quite a bit of contention even among people who are sympathetic to the
argument.

If you want to read some good-by-Web-standards commentary presented in a
sympathetic forum, there\'s http://www.extropy.com/eo/articles/vi.html ...
Extropians love this stuff.  I can\'t say it\'s my thing, but it\'s always
nice discussion fodder at least.  And it makes for damned fine speculative
fiction.

That\'s an interesting thought, but it might be stretching things too
far. 

But if heat qualifies, then so can *cold*. In an *atmosphere*, extreme
cold makes staying warm *very* hard, because you\'ve got conductive and
convective losses as well as radiation losses.

Actually, above a fairly low temp, the limit on a suit will be measured
in *minutes*. That\'s because it *already* has to get rid of a lot of
heat.

Actually, HF doesn\'t affect plastics much. Things like teflon were
*developed* to handle fluorine. 

*Glass* is readily attacked though. As are most metals. Though several
fairly common metals "passivate". That is, on exposure to fluorine they
develop a *hard* coat of <metal>fluoride, much like aluminum develops a
coat of aluminum oxide on exposure to oxygen. 

And Fluorine definitely belongs in the corrosive class.

Sounds nice. 

This reminds me of a news item from a few days back. Mattel and Intel
have gotten together to design some "toys". One that I\'m going to check
out is the "QX-3 Microscope" (I think I\'ver got the name right). 

It\'s a hybrid camera/microscope with a PC interface. What interests me
about it is that it looks to be one of the few computer cameras that
has "macro" capability. That is, the ability to produce large, *in
focus* pictures of *small* objects *close* to the lens. 

As such, it\'d be just the thing for snapshots of miniatures or models. 

At $90 suggested retail, it doesn\'t look to be that much more expensive
than the other cameras out there. And as a "toy" it\'s hopefully fairly
rugged. 


I\'m going to at least check it out.

Alas, the two *classic* example of Space Opera don\'t have fighters that
bank either. The Lensman series and the Skylark series. The first is
back in print and worth reading, if only for some nasty ideas.

Trenco is such a *lovely* planet. So is Delgon. And I want to see the

It was my understanding that the BORG wiped out "destroyer" sized attack
craft, reminiscent of our attack class subs in use today.  Fighters were
used in Star fleet training in the episode where Wesley\'s group screwed
around with a dangerous manuever and a cadet was killed when his fighter
craft blew up.

Would you be willing to consider something smaller, more ubiquitous, and
even more associated with the IISS than the Donosev class?  How about an
X-Boat tender upgrade, or even one of those mentioned-in-passing-in-JTAS
Type S variants used for extra-special courier duties and having only 2
staterooms, no cargo or craft, and all the rest fuel (55 tons\' worth under
CT, IIRC)?

Were the X-Boats themselves ever assigned a class name in any of the
various canons?  I don\'t seem to recall one...

Something essential to the very fabric of 3I civilization, in other
words... and something a little less ostentatious than a capital ship?



Just a thought...

The progression to a singularity, if such a thing exists, is a slow one.
It\'s simply a rationalization for what anybody who\'s looked into futurism,
science-fiction, political or social theories already knows: people have a
really hard time predicting the future correctly.

The concept of the Vingean singularity is extremely artificial, and
extremely speculative. The potential usefulness of the theory in the real
world aside, it\'s a really absurd idea to apply it to a roleplaying game
setting that quite probably has "singularity tech" in it anyway. Cheap
fusion power + antigrav? Sure we can "imagine" it, but I\'d stake my life
savings that should such technologies appear the results will not be merely
air/rafts and the like. That\'s a revolution on an unprecedented scale.

I mean, does anyone really think that we\'re in the business of *real*
futurism here?

No, it\'s the one with breasts on the ship. The one they swiped all the

 Very high on the "real" list you will find Poul Anderson\'s Falkayn/Van Rijn 
books
and the later (in the same timeline) Flandry books. Harry Harrison\'s Stainless
Steel Rat and Deathworld books are also specifically mentioned in an interview
w/Marc (in High Passage #2).

 Andre Norton\'s many SF books, of which the Solar Queen books are merely
the most obvious, also rate highly. You can bet Starship Troopers is also a 
factor.

I suggest you consider how fast computers are currently spreading. They
let people do things they *want* to do, yet in the process, they open
the gateway for the sort of thing that leads to the singularity.

Who said anything about *physically*? The singularity could occur
merely from following the path of new and better *games*, and fancier
web offerings. 

Just *try* and tell me that gamers won\'t be all over neural interfaces
as soon as they get remotely practical. And between potential military
uses and the possible aids to the handicapped that could come from
them, neural interfaces *will* be developed, if they are possible.

See above. The interfaces have medical, military and entertainment
uses. A faster Internet is also going to make money. 

And once we have both, how much do you think people would pay to be
able just think a question and have the interface feed them the answer?
At first, it\'d be just a handsfree calculator, datebook, and personal
secretary. As well as a cell phone.

If no one else does it, hackers will combine the game interface with
the comm links. And have someone resembling telepathy. From there, who
knows. Because at *that* point, we are already at the edge. Beyond, it
things get so weird, so fast that we can\'t predict the outcome.

But one possible "final step" will be if/when it becomes possible to
"upload" a personality into a computer. That\'ll remove the biggest
speed limitation. 

The steps leading up to the singularity are inevitable simply because
they *will* make money. And they\'ll also be desirable by even the
general public in most cases.

People are scared of changes. Usually because we aren\'t taught how
risks *really* work. 

For an interesting take on how we might "evolve" into post-humanity
read Marc Steigler\'s "The Gentle Seduction". It follows an "average"
person through the transition. Heck, she starts out not even being sure
that stuff like neural interfaces should be *allowed*.

Actualy, you are both confusing morals (does this conform with x set of
rules as handed down from \'on high\') and ethics (conforming with a
mutually agreed upon, mutually benifical set of rules). 

I\'ve mentioned metalaw before. It looks to be the best bet at a
universally applicable code of ethics.

Metalaw again. As long as your way of seeing things doesn\'t interfer
with my way of seeing things, we get along just fine.

This will also happen when we encounter aliens for the first time.
Especially if it\'s a case of us meeting non-industrialized aliens on
their home world.

I have some spare time and am currently addding a module on XML to one of my

I agree.

But what is our response to those that insist on interfering, such as
aggressively expansionist empires and mobs of frightened peasants with
pitchforks ?

Well, I did try and refrain from giving my opinion of it, I mainly find it
interesting because it brings up the idea that "intelligence" may mean
different things depending on context.

Exactly. There are several SF novels that cover this sort of thing, but a
lot of people don\'t realize how much it goes on between humans as well.

One example is the Organian\'s in the old Star Trek series, with both the
Federation and the Klingons\'s thinking they\'re low tech because they had no
obvious technology, both sides wanting to exploit them and the planet.

Canon also states that titles (all the way through duke) can be awarded as
rewards for service(s), in a manner not unlike british orders of nighthood.
Also, children of a noble recieve courtesy titles, as well. (See CT library
data for the article on nobility... it is a great resource to look at
here). Based upon CT and MT Careers, it is likely that the following are
true:

1)	Nobility who hold their own see (not fief, see detail below) are
fairly rare; it is hard to get a position and even harder to get promoted
as a "serving" noble.

2) The navy and Marines tend to get "Courtesy Titles", especially upon
attaining high ranks in the service; according to the article in Library
Data, whether or not they get a fief is questionable.

3) Reward nobility have skills based upon their career; The noble career
seems to be one of an administrator who dabbles in a lot of other things...
very reminiscent of the Barrayarran Imperial Auditor (from Bujold\'s
VorKosigan novels).

4) Career nobility carries with it the appropriate courtesy rank when you
leave it, and possibly a feif, to boot.

Nobles without a see are adressed as Baron John Doe, of Regni.
Nobles with a see are addressed as: Duke Regina, or Norris, Archduke of
Deneb. (Effectively, the office replaces the surname, except in very formal
circumstances).

Canon doesn\'t specify the nature or size of feifs. A feif is a parcel of
land that is associated with a noble patent.
<my interpretation begins here>
A noble office is a position that only a nobleman can hold (if a non-noble
manages to get in, he\'d be granted an appropriate title to go with the
office, and get the courtesy rank along with). An office has a "See" in the
same manner a bishop does; the see is that area under the administration of
the holder of a particular office, or whatever tthe &^&*(& the noble does,
he does for that area. The See of the Emperor is the Imperium, his fief is
(AFAI understand) Captol City, plus several estates throughout the Capitol
system. An office may also have an "official fief", ie a fief that is
attached to the office, not to the title. When you leave an office, you
would lose any official fief, as well, but if your patent of nobility
includes a fief, you retain the fief from your patent.

One thing I have done several times is to make fiefs that sometimes include
no land, or very little; one baron in a game I ran had a 23 story Apartment
building as a feif; another baron got the Isle of Adak (Terra/Spinward
Marches) as a fief, which puts it two hous by air-raft from Scout Base
Anchorage; most of his money was made on catering to scouts who wanted to
get away from the base, but still be near anough for recall. Yet another
had a 5 room flat, and a pile of megacorporate stocks as his feif... not a
lot of space, no land, but the stocks, and the staff that managed them made
enough for him to travel extensively.

I was just thinking yesterday in the car while using my voice-activated
"hands free" cellular headset, that with the addition of an intelligent
voice-activated name triggered phone number search, I could say "Eleonore?"
(my wife\'s name) and have the system automatically connect me with her.
Currently I have to have her number already on a preset to do this.

As I have actually written the server code to support finding users on a
mobile radio net,  I know that it would not be _difficult_  to add that
interface,  the hard code that finds the cell phone in the net is already
writeen, someone else has already written voice recognition software, and we
done;t have to install it on the phones, merely on the server you\'d get when
you used "Voice Phonebook",

It would not be as fast as a direct number to begin with, and we might have
to allow the user a choice if we have multiple original matches, but that\'s
no real problem, we have voice activated and recognising IVR sytstems now,
it\'s just a matter of writing one with a soundex algorithm that searches an
electronic phone book . Excuse me while I call Telecom\'s marketing
department

Couple that with making the headset and cellphone wearable or embedded, plus
everyone you want to talk to wearing one, and full planetary coverage, alll
of which are physically possible and only a little away from being
financially possible, (how much does an Iridium phone cost ?) though I\'ll
admit not everyone would want to be contactable at all times.

What effect does being able to talk to anyone, anywhere, just by saying
their name have on the way communication is conducted and on our social
conventions ?

I picture hundreds of people walking down the street, all talking to people
who aren\'t there .....

Add some "specs", so you could see a holographic representation of what the
person you\'re talking to looks like, and you get virtual meetings. All this
tech is here, now, the specs are available in 1024 x 768, laser reflecting
on retina, we can do simple VRML down existing mobile modems, it will get
better.

Teleworking by all working in the same _virtual_ room...

Anyne remember the scene from Earth 2 where they have a "ball" ?

Lenny, you got ya gear on?

When you can vist the Umbra or the land of Faerie by saying "O my magic
genie , take me to the world behind the veils" and you are there, has the
mythological age returned ?

This is the hardest, and most unlikely step IMO. There is currently no
forseeeable technoogy that will allow it, the rest is all possible with just
a little more work, either technicial or marketing, but this, it\'s just too
far out right now. We\'ll need to be able to accurately model the human mind,
which basically implies we\'ll have AI long before we get this far.

You may not need the final step though, everything could change so much
merely with existing technology being applied. Like, f\'rinstance, that shirt
that monitors your vital signs, the anti-theft device for cars (Smart Cars)
currently being marketed in Australia, the autonav system on Deep Space 1,
the automated gun  that was mentioned on here a while ago, combine this with
the automated sniper detection and targetting system that was developed a
year or two ago, the.., hell there\'s so many of them.

Are the stories of Faerie and Avalon merely premonitions of what we will
create, or memories of what the Atlanteans created before their fall ?

Damn, I\'ll have to write a novel about it now. <grin>

You gave someone *Adak* as a fief? Good lord, what did he *do*?

For those not familiar with it, Adak is generally considered *the* most
godforsaken spot that the US military (in particular, the USAF, IIRC)
could assign you to. 

It\'s one of the Aluetian Islands. It\'s nothing more than a hunk of rock
with a weather station on it. It might have an airstrip. There\'s
nothing to do, and while there are seasons, they are all notable for
lousy weather.

Folks that let info about Area 51 slip to Fox Muldar get assigned to
Adak. Folks that made their base CO look bad in front of top brass get
assigned to Adak. 

You get the idea...

With a Trav ship, how about mixing some of the hydrogen from the tanks
with the air plus whatever reserve oxygen there is lying around.

At optimum mix, you ought to be able to make a mess of the interior at
least.

A related thought - from "Death Traps" by Belton Y. Cooper. It seems you
could repair most things that happened to a Sherman tank - unless it
caught fire. If the tank burned, then it would anneal the armour back to
mild steel and the tank could not be repaired.

So, could a Hydrogen/Oxygen fire described above do a similar thing to
spaceship armour? Clearly it might cause crystaliron to recrystalise as
mild steel (give or take the alloying) but how stable is superdense?

Hey, thanks. 8-)

I\'d always meant to check the webring to see if I\'d actually added the
site okay but I\'m a programmer and that always struck me as a bit like
testing.

There was also the problem that I mangled the pdf file when I first put it
up but some helpful people on the TML spotted the problem and helped me
fix it (Paul Schirf\'s being the email I can find in my logs).

It\'s still there, but it\'s not what I need - it\'s got someone
singing the lyrics on it, and that\'s specifically what I _don\'t_
want.

The lyrics to "The Eternal Legionnaire" are to be sung to the
same music, and I\'d like to have the music to go with the text
for a planned web page.

Yes.  Thank you for your patience.

End of the month, 12 midnight PDT.

It might be possible to enter later than this, but officially entries close
then.  If things go like I expect, I will do my last download shortly after
midnight on Monday morning and start the Robot.  Entries that come in after
that will be ignored, so get those entries in now.  If you cannot get a
connection to
http://THUDDD.homepage.com/submit.html
you can email me and my client will automatically send you a copy if the
subject is "Get THUDDD Submission Form" (without the quote marks of course).
This will come in a zipped file that takes up c. 13.3 KB (13,657 bytes) and
will expand to c. 98.3 KB (101,841 bytes) file.  If you cannot handle zip
files, then you will need to make the subject "Get UnZIPped THUDDD
Submission Form" to get the uncompressed version.  Spelling and
Capitalization must be exact.

    'body' => 'IMHO the Emperor would create barons and other nobles as he needed them.
It depends on how he gathers information about his people.  He probably
takes periodic reports from his sector dukes and domain archdukes.  Those
nobles responsible for a subsector would probably take reports or issues
from world government representatives, noble or not, or even an Imperial
starport (or other facility) administrator (perhaps a knight-echelon duty).
Let\'s also keep in mind the younger children who don\'t inherit the noble
title but are of noble blood and heritage.  They would be a pool of high
level people for the Emperor to draw on.  Lets remember that the Imperium is
not a democracy, thus needs no representation according to population.  It
needs whatever the Emperor says it needs, and those solutions are (usually)
confirmed by the Moot.
    In the feudal sense, a baron is a title for someone who holds a fief
directly from the king.  Whether this noble actually has a job he does for
the Emperor or whether he just sits on his fief and is idle, is a matter of
why he got the fief in the first place.  It could have been a reward for an
act of extreme valor critical to the well being of the Imperium, or it could
be as compensation for an ongoing duty.  Having millions of barons just
because they have to represent people (how many per planet with a population
in the billions?) would water down the substance of the nobility to the
point where it would be no different or any more suited to rule than anyone
who had enough ability to be an elected representative for 50 million
people.  The world\'s legitimate government can send a
representative/ambassador to the lowest Imperial level (subsector count) who
then sends information up the Imperial noble pyramid (subsector counts,
sector dukes, domain Archdukes, emperor) and receives orders or guidance
from whatever level makes those decisions.  I guess it might be like being a
colonel in the army and a state governor at the same time.  The counties and
cities of the state can elect whoever they want to be their representative
the the colonel who governs the state.  This hypothetical army would have a
lot of colonels for different jobs, but only a few of them are colonels with
the job of being state governor.  The others command military units, control
the military police, act as liaisons with other services, and so on, and
they would all follow their chain of command up to the 5-star general who
ruled the country.
That\'s the word from the cheap seats.

I have no idea if they are still around, but if they are
long missing, I have been known to hack around with the SSV
code.  What are you interested in?

Interesting reading is being mentioned in this thread.  First Vinge
and now Steigler, both "Analog" alumni. <g>

I enjoyed Vinge\'s stories from the 80\'s and Steigler\'s stories from
the later 80\'s and early 90\'s, but then they disappeared (from
Analog).  I guess both went on to "other" things...like writing
novels.  

BTW, I think Joan Vinge is better known than her ?former husband?
Venor.  I *think* I remember her first story was about a shaman that
treated with genetically engineered snakes that injected antibiotics
and antitoxins rather than venom.

Frankly, I\'m just keeping an open mind about the various
technological/biological/curtural possiblities that may be
forthcoming in the next 20 or 30 years.  I used to think I had a
*good* handle on what was probable, possible, improbable and
impossible.  I\'ve downgraded that skill level to mediocre.  <sigh> 

I expected this economic wave to be into space, instead it went into
microelectronics.  I now expect the next wave to be biological.
With my track records, I also expect to be surprised again.

Brilliant! I agree. And good eye for detail there, I never would have caught

I\'ve also got to say that playing Traveller since the age of seven is
the reason that I chose the career that I\'m in.  Years spent lying on my
stomach on the living room floor designing High Guard ships has lead
directly to building spacecraft power systems, guidance systems, and
high performance computers.

It might be possible to enter later than this, but officially entries close
then.  If things go like I expect, I will do my last download shortly after
midnight on Monday morning and start the Robot.  Entries that come in after
that will be ignored, so get those entries in now.  If you cannot get a

Couple things, actually.  Any way to get the window scalable, like taking the \'geometry\' parameter, and is there any way of putting scroll bars in it?

He palled around with the emperor\'s GF, prior to Strephon meeting Iphegenia
(or is it Iolanthe? I can\'t keep the Empress and the Princess straight). He
also captained a rift cruise for the emperor, in order to evaluate the
cultures there, as to whether or not they were ready for increased imperial
attentions. He also returned a missing warrant. The emperor wanted him
comfortably retired out of the way, but where he could still be called upon
for troubleshooting if needed. Besides, the guy was in fact from the
Solomani Rim.

NAS Adak was (and is still) more that just a hunk of rock. There\'s the
airstrip, capable of handling a ASR and ASW squadron or three EACH, the
docks, for DD\'s and smaller. The base supported over a hundred families.
Not to mention several hundred more sailors. (I have a friend who did high
school at Adak High, at NAS Adak; his dad was the superintendant of
schools... a Civil Servant).

Adak is allowed to be an accompanied tour... for the navy, THAT is a GOOD DEAL.
And everyone I\'ve talked to who\'s been stationed there Liked it, except for
not being allowed to have visitors beyond immediate family come from off
island (eg:  parents or siblings or non-dependant children). And, it\'s
pretty. It has trees.

Oh, and the place to avoid is Shemya AFB. Shemya is also in the aleutians.
Shemya is known as the rock for a reason. Flat, no trees (and little
scrub), unaccompanied tour, NO visitors, the strip is closed about 50-70%
of the time, depending upon season. The only native animals of note are
tiny rodents and the Blue Foxes that prey upon them. Shemya is a forward
operations base.

And then, of course, there really is a "Camp Frostbite"... it is a series
of quonset huts on the tundra, that the Army uses for long term cold
weather training. Temps there have been known to get to -65F BEFORE wind
chill. And tundra has steady and constant winds. For those not familiar
with quonset huts, take the type of steel tubing with the wavy ribbing, cut
the tube into three sections along the length, then bolt them into one
arch, put a wooden wall at either end, and add power and a heating system.
most run about 60\' wide, 120-140\' long, and 2 stories. They sometimes
actually get insulated (CF\'s do, with spray on foam insulation against the
inside walls). Oh, and aside from class time, non-instructors at CF DON\'T
get to stay in the huts. It\'s miserable in the summer (Been there on a CAP
activity), when it\'s in the upper 80\'s and boggy; I would hate to see it in
the winter.

You\'re right, I\'d blotted out Shemya from my memory. No, I was never in
the service (couldn\'t pass the medical) but I\'ve known people who were.

Obtrav:

Let the players get a contract to do something on an out of the way
planet, well off the nearest main. A planet with an odd name "Shemya",
or "Adak". (Thule is from mythology, so it\'s more apt to get stuck on
something *interesting*).

This could be *real* fun if on of the *players* recognizes the name,
but has no way of justifying his *character* knowing it.

I\'m in an interesting position. My main "skill" doesn\'t even *exist* in
the game. You see, I have an odd sort of memory. It\'s not
"photographic". Instead, you can ask me about something, and I can give
you the gist of whatever I\'ve read about, and quite often, if I own the
reference or references, I can drag it out, and flip to the within a
few pages of the appropriate entry. Which means I\'ll be there in only a
few seconds. This works even in disorganized stuff like fictional
references or poorly laid out game rules.

I know a fair amount about computers, though far too much is for
obsolete stuff. My "skill" was very useful when I worked computer
support. I\'d get asked about some obscure command and either be able to
tell the person what they needed without even opening the manual, or
I\'d be able to find the text on page XXX that listed the fact that the
command worked differently on alternate leap years (said text never
being pointed to by the index, of course).

And yes, this means I actually *read* manuals. 

I also have a lot of info regarding physics and chemistry, picked up
over the years. As well as chunks of biology, geology, etc.

And I\'m fairly decent with a rifle.

The rest of my *wide* range of knowledge is probably best covered by JOAT-1.

William, you choose to live in Alaska.  For a Florida boy like me,
I\'m sure I\'d find it pretty all right...pretty damn cold!  <g>

The navy folks here in Pcola don\'t say bad things about Adak, but
the AF folks down the road at Eglin do.  They speak even more
unkindly of someplace called Minot.  <sp>

This gets into the area that fascinates me -- the intersection of
intelligence and motivation.  Niven\'s _Protector_ got me started on this,
long ago; I still highly recommend the book to anyone interested in this
area.  What he points out is that high intelligence is only a tool, an
"enabler", which is independent of motivation.  So for example his Pak
protectors are quite a bit smarter and faster thinkers than humans, but
*all* of that intelligence is focussed entirely on protecting their
bloodline.

** SPOILER **

What I found most interesting was that a human who became a protector
experienced the change as a loss of free will; for any given situation,
the right course of action was immediately apparent, inevitable, obvious.

** END OF SPOILER

All the way through duke?  Well, clearly the "high nobility" (i.e. those
hereditary noble houses who hold what you call "sees" where they
serve as Imperial representatives to a world or region) are created for
service to the Imperium beyond any reasonable expectation.  My guess
is that this doesn\'t happen very often -- there\'s only so many such
positions to go around, so the Emperor would tend to create new
ones only when an existing high-noble family line fails for some reason.

There\'s also those non-hereditary noble titles, though, tied to high
administrative rank or to special achievement in various fields.  MT
canon claims that the latter, at least, never get higher than marquis.
My take on it is that these non-hereditary posts almost never get
higher than the baronage.  I mean, think about it: what bureaucrat,
scientist or ordinary military officer is really going to earn social
precedence equal to the one direct Imperial representative to a
high-pop world?

(SUPP-4 is pretty clear that these non-hereditary positions don\'t carry
fiefs, by the way.  "Acheivement awards" usually just carry the title.
"Administrative rank" awards sometimes carry stipends, pensions, or
other perks, but not fiefs per se.)

Yeah, I\'ve had Supplement 11 open to page 34 on my desk for a few days
now :-).  Love those old LBBs.  They stay open forever when you lay them
flat. . .

I think you\'re referring here to "high" nobles as I sort-of defined above.
If so, I agree.

I suspect these titles are often of the non-hereditary variety, and would
normally not be higher than the baronage anyway.  I certainly remember
generating one or two Navy characters using the CT rules that started
out as commoners and ended up as counts or dukes. . .but I don\'t know
that this is something that would actually happen to the run-of-the-mill
NPC naval officer.

I really don\'t understand the Noble career from Supplement 4.  The
best way I can interpret the career path there is to claim that a
starting Noble character is a potential *heir* of a noble, and that the
rank he ends up with depends on whether he inherited the title itself
or ended up with just a courtesy title of some kind.  Certainly the
career path doesn\'t give the character a fief at the end. . .

>  Canon doesn\'t specify the nature or size of feifs. A feif is a parcel of

Correct -- although "administrative rank" nobles seem likely to get things
other than land at times.  I do seem to recall seeing somewhere a rough
sketch of how fief sizes correlate with noble rank.  Something like about
100 square km for a typical baron, going up by a factor of 10 for each
rank so that dukes end up with about 100,000 square km.  That strikes
me as a very rough rule of thumb at best.

My question still remains, though.  Given all the ways one might get
handed a baronage -- given all the roles the barons play in Imperial
society -- how many barons are there likely to be?

I think you misunderstand me.  I don\'t claim that the Imperium tries to
maintain any kind of "representation" so that barons each stand for
some fixed number of people.  In fact, I imagine the size of the baronage
relative to local population varies pretty drastically depending on local
circumstances.

On the other hand, since elevation to the peerage is one of the ways
the Imperium has to encourage loyalty and hold the empire together,
I suspect the Emperors have a policy of maintaining at least some
minimum number of barons in every world\'s population.  You need those
visible signs of Imperial presence and interest, after all.

Meanwhile, it\'s clear that the baronage is the backbone of Imperial
administration, so every population needs barons to staff the machinery
of Imperial government.

And -- hey, this is a new thought -- where else are you going to put all
those children of upper-rank nobles who don\'t inherit the titles themselves?
You could give them "courtesy ranks," but you could also put them in
the baronage.  Their title would be real, if not as high as the one their
older brother or sister inherited.

All that would tend to cause a (very rough) correlation between the size
of a local population and the size of the local baronage.

So, to rephrase my question -- "How many barons is the Emperor
likely to need on a given world?"  Even a rough rule of thumb (assuming
the audience can agree on one) would be useful to me.

Reminds me of the time when I first started to grasp the idea of "polar
climate". In one of my geography books in grade school, there was this
photo of someone in Siberia taking home some milk. The milk was in the
form of a *slab of ice* tucked under his arm. 

I don\'t want to *think* about the Russia equivalent of "Camp
Frostbite". Not when you consider that there are places in Central
Siberia where the temperature *regularly* drops below -100!

The GM thing is a combination of effects:

1) The standard luddite \'technology is bad\' that some pressure groups have,
especially in the UK.
2) The fact that the choice to have fully GM or more traditional foods is
being erased by the US agri-business in combination with the US government.
(EU law requires GM modified products to be labelled - there has been an
ongoing dispute with the US government on this, and then there is the
mixing of soya..).
3) Monstanto (as an example) is also giving GM a bad press with the
terminator genes and patents on existing plants. And also the arrogance
with which their PR works.
4) A flawed study (which the Lancet is publishing) on the effect of GM
modified products which got a lot of press.

The GM industry could learn a lot from the nuclear industry but it seems
set on repeating the same mistakes.

You\'re right, I\'d blotted out Shemya from my memory. No, I was never in
the service (couldn\'t pass the medical) but I\'ve known people who were.

Obtrav:

Let the players get a contract to do something on an out of the way
planet, well off the nearest main. A planet with an odd name "Shemya",
or "Adak". (Thule is from mythology, so it\'s more apt to get stuck on
something *interesting*).

This could be *real* fun if on of the *players* recognizes the name,
but has no way of justifying his *character* knowing it.

And it was interesting that it was only those Protectors who no longer had
any "herd"  that could effectively carry out research and invent new things,
and then only when they could avoid dying due to the loss of their herd and
replace the motivation of protecting a single herd with the concept of
somehow protecting the entire race.

Remarkably similar to humans really, huh ? <grin>

Well, personally, I found that bit a little sillly.

Sure the Protectors could be wired to think that way as they were very
conservative creatures and instinct driven , but in order for the _right_
course of action to be apparent to anyone, even a highly intelligent person,
they would have to have perfect knowledge,  as well having a confirmed set
of ethics that allowed them to decide what was "right"

I read the Protector as being wired to always choose the _optimal_ solution,
and optimal meant least number of damaged breeders in the forseeable future.
It was a loss of free will, but though the choice was wired to _seem_ like
being the _right_ course to the Protector, anyone with a more active mind
than a Protector (for all it\'s intelligence and capability a Protector is a
pretty stupid and predictable creature to a similar level intelligence
without the hardwired "Protector" instincts ) would realize that it was
really only the most optimal course given certain constraints (in this case
limiting damage to breeders) , and that they had no way of determining if it
was the best or the right course of action, and as such they might come up
with a better, though not necessarily optimal, solution

Not sure if I can explain the difference between the "best" solution and the
"optimal" solution, but I\'l try. I think it has to do with the fact that
without perfect knowledge, a solution that may seem optimal is not really
the most optimal, and it is possible, if you are not hardwired to chose the
_most_ optimal, you may choose the better solution for reasons other than
logic.

Sorry, that was a bit rambly.

It does however bring up a far more interesting concept with relation to a
God or "Protector" who _does_ have perfect knowledge. With perfect
knowledge, and "perfect" intelligence,  then, yes, your every action would
become utterly constrained and you would indeed lose all free will, and all
your actions would be forever be set (or alternatively you would be unable
to act )

Taking _this_ "Protector" concept a wee bit further, we reach the Herbert
solution to the quandary of a God with perfect knowledge, as detailed in
"God Emperor of Dune" , try and breed your subjects so that you _can\'t_ have
perfect knowledge of their actions. In other words, try and create something
you can not "see" with your omniscience, and which they cannot "see" either,
thereby giving _them_ free will, and incidentally introducing a measure of
free will for yourself, due to your now less than perfect knowledge...

This, of course is remarkably close to certain theological arguments
espoused several centuries ago by (I think) Thomas Aquinas ..... <grin>

Here\'s another vote for an exploration class starship.
I think the following paraphrase works well  :

Here\'s an idea. J Andrew Keith designed the "Beltstrike" adventure module for 
GDW (1984). It took place in the Bowman system (Bowman/District 268/Spinwards 
Marches). I originally thought that maybe we should change the name of the 
star (and hence the entire system) to "Keith", but I decided that a lot of 
people probably wouldn\'t want to have to write on their Spinwards Marches 
maps. So I decided why not change the name of the system\'s only planet 
instead. This wouldn\'t screw up maps, and "Keith" sounds a lot better than 
"Bowman Prime". It\'s just a pity the planet\'s a gas giant, and not an 
inhabited world...

No, I never chose to live here, I just can\'t afford the cost of moving out
of state without giving up all my possessions. Given my druthers, I\'d live
in portland oregon, or maybe tacoma, washington. I just haven\'t been able
to gather a nestegg big enough for an out of state move (Typically, about
3-4 thousand dollars for a family of 3 and their goods, but not any
vehicles). I\'m stranded in alaska because my PARENTS got shipped up here by
the US Army, and they liked it. (note the use of the past tense!)

While it is beautiful, most of alaska is widely varied from summer to winter.

The Army has the Korean DMZ.  My one trip there, in 1986, the temperature
was -30, and the winds were 50mph+  The South Koreans had gone home.  The
North Koreans had gone home.  The only people *stupid* enough to be out in
that weather was the US frigging infantry.

Actually, Leonard, this isn\'t all that uncommon of a skill among
roleplayers. There\'s probably an interesting study in there somewhere. I\'ve
known several long time roleplayers who have the exact same ability. In
fact, I was just thinking about it yesterday when I had a few seconds to
myself.

I\'ve always just considered it a fuzzy version of a photographic memory. I
can read something once in a book and remember roughly where it is just by
"feel." I can flip through a book and within a few seconds find a passage or
a quote, no problem.

It\'s a great party trick, and it saves on highlighter ink and marring my
books with margin notes ;)

An interesting idea... UPP scores for ourselves... the closest
I ever came to doing that was in the old superhero RPG "Villains
& Vigilants", whose standard rules call for each player to play
*themselves* as superheroes (ie, come up with the base stats,
then add super-powers). Then there\'s the time my gaming group came
up with what various GURPS advantages and disavantages we would have
(all but one of us have Bad Sight, for instance...)

Glenn St-Germain	764A86-0	Terms: 4.75

The skills are going to be difficult... The easy ones:
	Admin - 1
	Computer - 2
	Ground Vehicle - 1

But what skills would cover the world of Library Science? (In both
GURPS and Hero, I could just come up with Professional Skill: Librarian...)

I\'ve got a pretty broad base knowledge of things that involve lots of
people, movements of all sorts, ideologies, cultures, whatever. My passions
are history (mostly 19th century and early 20th century history) and
folklore. I\'m an avid trend watcher, especially toy trends. I enjoy trying
to figure out why they succeed and why they fail. You can frequently find me
haunting the toy aisles at the local Toys \'R\' Us seeing what\'s hot and
what\'s not. My friends always hate going shopping with me \'cause I can spend
hours in toy stores watching parents and kids and the latest toy mutations.
I try my best to keep up with all sorts of trends, not just toy trends, but
it can be very overwhelming.

That\'s one reason I like doing my current Traveller campaign in GURPS
rather than a standard Traveller system (ie, CT, MT, TNE, T4...) --
standard Traveller has no provision for unusual knacks such as
Absolute Direction (which one of the guys in my game group would have),
Absolute Timing (which I seem to have), or Eidetic Memory (which you
would have at the 30-point level -- true "photographic memory" would
be the 60-point level).

(Which makes me wonder what Traveller skill would reflect having a mind 
like a steel trap for trivia, like I have. It\'s a frequent source of 
annoyance to my friends, but it\'s also a handy thing to have in my line 
of work...)

Luckily, as an Arabic-speaking interrogator, I never had to deploy to
Korea.  (North Carolina\'s climate was unpleasant enough, thank you....)

On the other end of the thermal spectrum, I had the distinct pleasure of
two six-month tours with the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) in
the Sinai Peninsula.  Both of my tours were May to November (May
1986-November 1986 and May 1987 to November 1987).  Thus, I was
privileged to spend two summers in a row in temperatures of 45-50
degrees Celsius.  At that, I had it better than the infantry.  At least
I didn\'t have to go on patrols for two or three days at a time.  (It\'s
_good_ to be the interpreter....)

ObTrav:  Climate differences help justify the premise that most Imperial
Army forces are locally recruited.  After all, local forces are best
able to handle local variations in climate.

Joan Vinge is probably better known than Vernor Vinge; her most famous book
is "The Snow Queen" which I recall was really good but can\'t remember what
it was about.

However, the book you are talking about, "Dreamsnake", which started out as
a short story, "Of Mist, and Grass, and Sand", was written by Vonda
McIntyre, who has to be one of my all-time favorite authors.  I think she\'s
best known for writing the "Starfarers" series of hard sf, one of the best
series of hard sf I\'ve ever read because it had technology AND characters,
and several of the Star Trek novels that were actually worth reading.  Other
works she\'s responsible for are "Barbary" (which is really cute),
"Superluminal" (romantic hard sf, it\'s actually possible), and "The Exile
Waiting".  I really, really, really like her stuff, in case you missed that
point...  =)

Minot is in (I think) North Dakota. Miles from anywhere, and it gets
colder than any island this side of Antarctica.

What you read wasn\'t what he (or Niven) meant. "Only one right answer"
*includes* the limited knowledge. 

For a protector with a given info store and tool set, there *is* only
"one answer" to any given problem. 

Whether or not the answer is the "best" answer isn\'t relevant, because
if it isn\'t it has to require either knowledge he doesn\'t have or tools
he doesn\'t have. 

And when you get right down to it, the same is true for us. The
difference is that we aren\'t bright enough for the answer to be obvious
most of the time.

I did that with the OS/2 port, but never got back to implementing
it in the Xlib version.  Raw Xlib is not for the faint-of-heart... :-)
I didn\'t know there was interest in it still; I may just take a look
at it. Nag me periodically if you don\'t hear anything about it in
the next 4 months.  At the very least, I can hack the colors for
Red Zones & Amber Zones back in.

An added complication you need to remember is that it is possible
to hold multiple titles.  For example: our old favorite Norris is
the Duke of Regina, Count of Aledon, and Baron of Yori (IIRC) ...
and later Archduke of the Domain of Deneb.

For an *abstract* mathemetical solution to the question  I  would
employ the following rules:

- - low/zero population worlds do not have a title seat.
- - high population worlds have a Marquis
- - sector/subsector capitals have a Marquis
- - all others have a Baron
- - total worlds divided by 4.5 (average) gives how many Counts
- - each subsector with more than 6 worlds has a Subsector Duke
- - one Subsector Duke per sector is also a Sector Duke
- - each Duke is also a Count (average) so reduce total  number  of
  Counts by total number of Dukes.
- - each Count is also either  a  Marquis  or  Baron  (average)  so
  reduce total number of  Marquis + Barons  by  total  number  of
  Counts

For detailing local areas I recommend doing it by  "hand"  rather
than using  a  formulaic  approach.  In  addition  to  the  local
hierarchy include  a  cross  web  of  political  allegiences  and
antagonisms.

I always saw the local Baron or Marquis as fulfilling the role of
the "Emperor\'s Ambassador" to the local planet.  Apart  from  not
really needing one for low population worlds, in general  a  high
population world doesn\'t need any more "representatives"  than  a
medium population world.

Also filling the role of "planetary advocate".  I\'ve always thought that
noble families would have their income tied to the economies of their
holdings.  This would encourage them to work to improve their holdings.

Nobles might also be charged for the expenses of Imperial Interventions if
they fail to contain problems.

And, to be fair, because they\'ve been fed so much BS and wrong information
that they\'ve learned to be more cautious about what the technocrats tell
them.  "DDT is safe," "PCBs are safe," "Union Carbide will be good for
Bhopal," "Cassini can\'t hit Earth because NASA/JPL never ever blow their
nav calculations"...after a while, you can\'t blame people for having a
twitch-level "no!" reaction when they hear about some "harmless" new
technology in something as fundamental as the food supply.

And, by the way, transgenic crops are fundamentally different from
previous methods of genetic crop improvement.  Hybridization can produce a
far more limited range of results.  Transgenics have been far less
extensively studied.  None of which is to say that transgenics aren\'t
safe, which is a different argument -- it\'s simply to point out that
arguing "we\'ve been doing it for centuries" is misleading, and indeed part
of the PR problem.

Actually, this does surprisingly little damage.  Hydrogen and oxygen
burning turn into water, for a net volume *decrease*.  The temperature
incrase helps compensate for this, but not enough to make this a \'good\'
explosion.  An H/O explosion at 1 atm doesn\'t create an overpressure wave
big enough to crack bulkheads or damage tough equipment.  It will ignite
combustibles, though, which is why I included this step in my "How to
Trash a Ship" recipe.

No, again, the temperature and pressure achieved in a 1 atm H/O explosion
aren\'t high enough.

Many metal dusts would be pyrophoric.  If the planet didn\'t have an

Actually, Protectors with intact families could do research -- remember,
the balance of power shifts that left Phthssspok childless were due to an
arms race between nuclear damper and bomb technology -- but only childless
protectors could do "blue sky" basic research, stuff with no clear link to
protecting the kids, or killing the ones in the next valley.

I saw this as quite reasonable.  As Patton remarked (paraphrasing), a
half-formed plan executed immediately and violently will succeed over a
brilliant plan mulled over for a week.  The Pak, being bred for war, would
evolutionarily favor the sort of mind that reaches a firm conclusion
quickly, based on whatever evidence is available, and acts on it *right
now*.  And being superintelligent, they would be right (enough) more often
than not.

In other words, a Pak never hesitates due to self-doubt or indecision or
the like.  Whether or not it is \'right\' in some external sense, internally
it always \'knows\' it is right and thus can act without reservation.

But to a Protector, protecting the breeders *is* the definition of
optimal.  No other criterion matters.  And the point Niven is making (as I
see it) is that *any* intelligence is similarly wired for what constitutes
a \'good\' decision, perhaps with more possible goals and at least the
illusion of choosing between them, but wired nonetheless.

Given the mercantile nature of the 3I and the canonical assignment of stocks
to Imperial Nobility I would expect that a "fief" translate to an income
source of some type: stocks, bonds, real estate, company ownership, etc.
After all, historically that\'s what the purpose of a noble\'s holding were
for, to allow them to squeeze income out of the commoners.

    I\'m of average strength, decent endurance, but a clutz. I\'d like to
think that I\'m intelligent and well educated, but there are certainly those
smarter than I. Nothing too special about my family, although my father
hobnobs with some political big-wigs.

    I spent almost three years in the Air Force in intelligence, primarily
in image analysis (computer, admin, rifleman, pistol, leader, and survey).
After a medical discharge, I entered college as an aerospace engineer (naval
architect) - but found it too difficult. Switched to computer science with a
minor in astronomy, specializing in operating system design and distributed
systems (more computer and physics). I\'ve held a few odd jobs over the
years, including an EMT/Rescue Diver  (medical, helicopter, scuba,
watercraft). Right now I am a programmer/analyst working in distributed
architectures (more computer) and a teacher at a local community college
(instruction). I\'ve only got a BS, but a ton of practical education.

    The brawling and sword are from marital arts training in Aikido and
Kenjutsu. If I wasn\'t so clumsy, I\'d be pretty good, as I\'ve had several
years of formal training.

Regarding Korea my dad was at the Chozen Reservoir with Blitzen Litzen\'s
Marines in 1950.   For years when asked about the experience he would only
say "It was cold."  When pressed for more his response was "It was damned
cold."   He frost bit his hands, feet and portions of this thighs but except
for nerve damage didn\'t lose anything to the cold.   They fought their way
out and didn\'t leave either their equipment or their dead behind.

Regarding the above how about a Hammer\'s Slammers type operation which
combines elements of the Inchon landing, the Chinese entry  of troops and
the siege of Bastogne/Peking with a breakout and fighting withdrawal back to
a favorable extraction point.   It could be played as an intelligence screw
up, complete with miscalculations regarding the opposing force\'s strength,
tech,  and local weather extremes.   Put the PCs on the ground in a very
cold very target rich environment trying to pull togeather disparent
friendly forces and the equipment for a breakout.

Could be a very interesting campaign.

Well, _either_ is better than tequila that\'s been baking in the sun for
a day or two, believe me! Oh, yeah, that\'s the _other_ reason they like
to register ships out of Panama and Liberia...something about lax safety
inspections and regulation.

Now, I only hope that the ships owners were foresighted enough to at
least pack enough beer, if they didn\'t pack enough water...a mutiny led
by ships crew hopped up on drinking nothing but Coke would be a scary
thing indeed...

In a Vacc Suit, you would likely float. IN BD you would sink, at least
until you kicked in the grav belt...of course, depending on the water
depth, you _could_ just sink down \'till you hit bottom, then walk out,
like in that scene in "Highlander" ;-)

My rough rule of thumb is that there is one Baron per 10-25 thousand people.
I typically have a knight or three per thousand...

    'body' => 'Here\'s an idea for honoring Mr. Keith.:

 J Andrew Keith designed the "Beltstrike" adventure module for GDW (1984). It 
took place in the Bowman system (Bowman/District 268/Spinwards Marches). I 
originally thought that maybe we should change the name of the star (and 
hence the entire system) to "Keith", but I decided that a lot of people 
probably wouldn\'t want to have to write on their Spinwards Marches maps. So I 
decided why not change the name of the system\'s only planet instead. This 
wouldn\'t screw up maps, and "Keith" sounds a lot better than "Bowman Prime". 
It\'s just a pity the planet\'s a gas giant, and not an inhabited world...

Here\'s a sample TNS article to announce it:

FLASH FLASH FLASH
282/1117 Glisten/Glisten/Spinwards Marches

    Today it was announced by the Glisten Institute of Planetological studies 
in cooperation with Ling Standard Products, LIC, and his grace Duke Loren of 
Glisten (whose fief also administers District 268), that the Bowman system\'s 
(Bowman/District 268/Spinwards Marches) solitary planet, the gas giant Bowman 
Prime would be renamed "Keith", in honor of the late historian.

    Dr. Sir J. Andrew Keith, who died four months ago was famous throughout 
the Spinwards Marchs and the Solomani Rim for his two seminal works on the 
antebellum (pre-5FW) history of the Marches, and the history of the IISS. Dr. 
Keith was knighted last year by the Archduke of Deneb for these two works, 
and since then has chaired the GLIPS history department. 

    Dr. Keith was born on Terra (Sol/Sol/Solomani Rim) where he earned his 
doctorate at the University of Terra. His doctoral dissertation on the role 
of the IISS in the Solomani Rim War was highly received by both Vilani and 
Solomani intellectual circles on Terra. He transferred to the Glisten 
University of Planetological Studies as a visiting fellow in 1107. Dr. Keith 
is survived by his brother, Dr. Sir William H. Keith Jr., who is also a 
member of the GLIPS history department staff, and who will probably succeed 
to his brother\'s chair at the next meeting of the University regents. In a 
joint statement released to the TNS, the President of the GLIPS and the 
seneschal of his Grace, the Duke of Glisten both said "that the Imperial 
academic community, and the people of the third Imperium have lost a great 
mind and a great soul, and we will all be diminished by Dr. Keith\'s absence". 
The TNS also wishes to extend it\'s condolences to the late Dr. Keith\'s family 
and colleges. Ad Astra Dr. Keith. This transmission ends..................

I hope that you all will find this a satisfactory obituary for Mr. Keith. I 
hope I didn\'t offend anyone.

You really *need* to track down copies of the Skylark Series:

"The Skylark of Space"
"Skylark Three"
"Skylark of Valeron"
"Skylark DuQuesne"

All by E.E. "Doc" Smith.

The escalating power levels are fun. And the series has *the* single
most interesting villian ever concieved. Dr. Marc C. DuQuesne. He\'s
amoral, but charming. He keeps his word, but to the letter. He\'s smart
enough to realize when revenge is a waste of time. And he\'s willing to
work alongside the good guys if there\'s a danger to humanity. 

OBTrav:
Since the last we see of him, he and his girl friend are heading off to
find a nice, isolated branch of humaniti to become benevolent despots
of, you could easily justify a pocket (or larger) empire somewhere run
the way DuQuesne was planning to run his. (You\'ll see what I mean after
you\'ve read the books)

It\'d make things interesting for the players.

Actually, the big shipments are in metal (steel, I presume) cylinders.
But you\'ll easily recognize a truck set up to carry high pressure
hydrogen. Instead of one big tank, it\'ll have a bunch of long narrow
cylinders running in parallel. They aren\'t a lot thicker than your

Well, I was thinking more of fine (nearly mono-molecular) dust of
compounds of the metals. Oxides, sulfides, chlorides, whatever is
appropriate to the atmosphere.

Mercury vapor is another of those monatomic "molecules". So it
pentrates things *way* too well. One lovely shot in an article about it
showed the vapor rising from an open container of mercury. Then they
poured in some water (it used to be thought that storing it underwater
cut the vapor emissions to a safe level). The vapors weren\'t as thick,
but there were *still* way too many of them.

Also, for our poor explorers, mercury forms amalgams on contact with
many metals. So exposed metallic surfaces on equipment would pick up
mercury outside and might release it inside. Oops!

I will note that getting high levels of mercury vapor in the air would
required some unusual geology. And it\'d be *likely* to only affect
"small" areas. But inside those areas....

On the other hand, if we are going to allow chlotine or fluorine
atmospheres, I supposed a planet wide mercury taint is ok. Just keep it
*rare*.

No kidding.  I\'m not a C coder in the least.  I do some Turbo Pascal, and 
yeah, I got the Free Pascal Compiler for Linux, but I\'m having problems 
making it talk with Xwindows.  Graphics programming was *never* my strong

	It\'s fairly high on the gearhead scale. It\'s really not tutorial in
any area of engineering--it assumes you have the basics and just need
a "crib" sheet. From the back cover:

	"This third edition of /Space Mission Analysis and Design/, known as
SMAD to its many friends, carries on the tradition of the first two
editions of providing a practical handbook for *Space Mission
Engineering*--the process of defining mission parameters and refining
requirements to meet the often fuzzy objectives of a space mission at
minimum cost and risk. We begin the process with a \'blank sheet of
paper\' and carry the reader through a preliminary mission design
covering all system aspects: orbit and constellation design, mission
geometry, launch vehicle selection, and design of the spacecraft,
payload, ground segment, and operations. The book is a comprehensive
presentation of theory and practice, drawing on the insight and

	Actually, IRL we do test destruct systems fairly thoroughly.
Everything gets exercised except the actual initiators, which are
replaced with dummy loads and/or test equipment.

Reminds me of one of my favorite lines from _Snow Crash_.  Paraphrasing
from memory:  "In the North Pacific, a standard life vest just makes the
corpse float." :)

I\'ll bet either could handle the heat situation just fine, I agree a
standard vacc suit would float and that BD would probably sink, and that
with BD you could probably go perhaps 100m down without worrying too much
about the pressure.

Great image just flashed by...BD trooper gravving along above the ocean,
gets shot at, grav failure, drops like a stone into the ocean.  Defenders
on shore cheer, go back about their business.  Ten minutes later, the BD
trooper walks out of the surf, *pissed*.

My first major science-based "I told you so" pulled on my long-suffering
wife involved this very phenomenon.  She had broken a mercury thermometer,
and asked me if it was safe to play with the tiny blob of mercury briefly
before disposing of it.  "Yes, briefly," I replied, then had a sudden
realization.  "Oh, wait -- be *sure* to take off your rings, first,
mercury will hurt the gold."

Needless to say, She Didn\'t Listen (a continuing theme...), and figured
she could just be careful not to let the mercury blob actually *touch* the
rings she was wearing.  Of course, she wasn\'t aware that the mercury was
spreading out in a thin layer over her whole palm and lower finger joints,
nor how little mercury it takes to wreck the lattice structure of gold.

Flash forward an hour.  She\'s getting ready for bed, and glances down at
her rings.  "That\'s odd, they look silver.  Wait, they *are* silver...Uh
oh!  Maybe I can wash it off..."  And, in trying to pull the rings off her
finger, both snap in half.

A gold-mercury amalgam is *very* soft and brittle.

Real-world story:  The hills above where I grew up (the south end of San
Jose, California)  was at one time the largest mercury-mining site in the
world.  You could still find bright-orange outcrops of cinnabar up there
all over the place.  Apparently, the local natives had at one time also
noticed this lovely color, and decided it would make great skin paint.
They had a legend about this, in which the tribe nearly died from mercury
poisoning until Coyote cured them and warned them to stay away from the
orange stuff from then on.

\'Robot Jocks\' wasn\'t that bad.  Besides, it gave Gary Graham some needed work between the end of \'Alien Nation\' and an appearance on \'Star Trek: Voyager\'.

No, again, the temperature and pressure achieved in a 1 atm H/O explosion
aren\'t high enough.

I know it might take a little more time but - considering that we are
talking about an artificial environment here - is it strictly necessary that,
at the time of the explosion, the internal atmospheric pressure be only
one atmosphere?

Would it make a difference if you could pump the pressure up to
three or four atmospheres, even if it were only in places like Engineering
Control or the Avionics Bay?

I think (weren\'t they known as the Marooka Force - that first went to NG?)
they were a militia group that was partially conscripted, but wholy
volunteered afterwards to serve OS when called upon?

I went back to the books when I had five minutes to spare (daughter\'s recent
wedding announcements have turned things upside down...), and from the
encyclopedia of Australia\'s Heritage I managed to glean some things (not a
great deal).

* Our constitution has always allowed for "conscription into the militia."
and after the defeat of PM "Billy" Hugh\'s Conscription Referendum in Oct,
1916, militia conscription was used for the fist time "For Home Services
Only" and has funnily enough, never been viewed as conscription as we know
it today??  Semantics or not, it was not considered what we call
conscription... go figure?

* PM John Curtin was to introduce conscription for the good of the nation,
but taking time to have the referendum palatable to the Australian people
(who had lost friends and family in the Great War and/or whom had campaigned
against the 1st conscription referendum), had let many war years slip past
before it came to the voting booths.  The vote for Conscription was a "NO"
and the bill failed.

I found in War and Australia:-

* Militias were "called up" during WWII, but basically, only those who chose
to volunteer from the militias for OS duties were actually sent.  There were
still many military functions on home soil that needed tending to by
military servicemen and the need to defend the homeland if an invasion were
to take place, so no one was forced to volunteer to go OS.

There was no doubt from my POV that there was probably a great deal of
coercion, such as appeals to heart strings ("Think of your mates dying in
Africa mate..."), to name calling ("You\'re a coward, do you know that?  Men
dying to defend low life like you and you\'re just taking it easy here..."),
and possibly urging by friends and family for honour sake or just for the
good of the country.

So technically, we have always had a charter for conscription into
home-based militias, and this was called upon in both WWI and WWII, but
until PM Robert Menzies introduced National Service (aka
Natios/conscription/compulsory service - which began with the first draw in
mid 1965), Australia has never had a ratified conscription bill before
Vietnam.

I cannot argue with someone saying, "My dad was a conscript in WWII..." as I
don\'t have arguments for what someone so close to another says he did at a
given time.  All I have are certain books I own and military history as told
by those I served under.  These sources are by no means gospel either, so I
am open for correction still.

How about, like John Curtin, ObTrav:  A PM of a world\'s government that
fought against conscription in the last big war and being strong on that
stand after the war was over, then being in power with the shoe on the other
hand!  He hates to have to say it, but now his party will have to raise
troops via conscription.  Only his wanting to do it right for those involved
has cost years in draughting the bill.  The consequences could be varied.

In Aussie history, the bill failed because the urgency was (that the bill
was being ratified under) lost so the bill failed and the war was won
without it anyway.  But in the Marches, untold human life could have been
lost due to the need of extra manpower or worse... the war was lost because
of it!!

her dead" is because once you sink below the surface layer (which may
be sunwarmed in the summer) the water temp is a constant XX degrees. 

Cold enough that the decay processes alter. Corpses don\'t bloat, they
just sit there and decay via other processes. So they never rise back
up to the surface.

Watch out for assumptions. *Conventional* Vacc suits would be be well
insulated, as long as you keep a slight positive pressure (which will
make it hard to move). Without the extra pressure, say for example if
you\'ve lost your helmet, you could actually lose heat *rapidly*. If you
are wearing a "skin suit" (the elastic leotard thingie) you *will*
freeze. 

The reason for the rapid heat loss with the conventional suit is that
vacuum suits are *not* designed to insulate. They are designed to be
air-tight. Because *in a vacuum* you can only lose heat by radiation
from a sealed suit, you have to wear an undergarment that has fluid
circulated thru it to (usually) carry off excess body heat, but can
also provide some heating (rarely needed). The fluid carries the heat
to the EVA pack, which dispooses of it in various ways (some use
limited evaporative cooling). 

Dumped in a cold ocean, with only the "stock" EVA pack, you won\'t stay
warm long unless you use the inflation trick to provide a layer of air
between the gas tight membrane and the cooling garment.

Do keep in mind that every 10 meters is an extra atmosphere of
pressure. And seabottom terrain can be *rough*. Of course, that last
is probably *why* the trooper is so pissed.

I saw "Battle Beyond the Stars" playing with (I think) "Last Days of
Man on Earth" (based on Michael Moorcock\'s "Jerry Cornelius" stories).

But "Godzilla 1980" was even more of a turkey. The co-feature for
*that* was an unexpected treat. A very *strange* movies titled "The
Stuff". I won\'t spoil it, I\'ll just say "go out and rent it!"

After you\'ve watched it, sand off the serial numbers and do it to he
players you GM for. :-)

I wonder if any tribes ever tried that with autunite. It\'s such a
*lovely* bright yellow. It\'s also a uranium ore. And I\'m not sure
whether heavy metal poisoning or radiation would be the bigger danger. 
(It\'s even possible that neither is a danger, except for very long term
exposure).

Oh yeah, that reminds me. You could actually make a fair profit selling
depleted uranium to low TL worlds. You see, uranium makes the only
really decent yellow pottery glazes. It also makes a nice orange, but I
think there are other sources for that. It makes an interesting green
glass too. 

As such, even a fairly small amount is actually worth the shipping
costs, and probably even the cost of the export licenses.

That sort of pressure is going to break bulkheads and seals, even
without an added explosion. One atmosphere is roughly one
kilogram-force per square cm! There are a lot of square cm on a

Oh, yeah! One of my favorites from a mis-spent youth reading 
every sci-fi book I could get my hands on.  I am convinced that
Dr Marc C. Duquesne is the inspiration behind Julian May\'s
tragic villian/hero Marc Remilliard (The Pliocene Exile series,
the Galactic Milieu trilogy). The personalities are too similar,
and they\'re both French-Canadians with the first name Marc.

Trade-offs: Remilliard is a Paramount Grandmaster Metapsychic,
Duquesne has the DQ. Heh.

Hmm ... this could lead to a conflict of interests.  For example:
if a planetary government was intending to become  socialist  and
nationalise all private industry this would be detrimental to the
local noble\'s income.  That noble might use his  position  within
the Imperial nobility to bring pressure to bear  against  such  a
move.  Thus the 3I would be meddling in  local  affairs.  Or  the
local government might try to buy out the local noble\'s  holdings

It would take some fiddling.. perhaps tie the noble\'s income to some
economic index..

	Given that a strand of DNA sitting on a table will not
	become very intelligent, the influence of environment
	cannot be ignored.  A certain "gene" that is associated
	with high intelligence in one environment may tend to
	result in low intelligence in another.  Even in the 
	first environment, insufficient nutrition may result in
	low intelligence.  Then, there is the influence of our
	experience in life.

	The "environment" is not restricted to the personal
	experiences of a person since they were born.  Of course,
	such experiences are very important, but how much influence
	they have on "intelligence" or "capability for intelligence"
	depends on how these terms are defined.

<snipped>
>"Genetically", i.e hardware-wise , it isn\'t.

	Beware the trap of seeing "genetic" as "carved in stone."
	Certainly, your genetic make-up places restrictions on
	many things, but environmental influences are crucial.

	That sort of manipulation may well improve certain aspects
	of intelligence (depending on how it is defined), but the
	complex net of neural connections in the brain are not 
	likely to be as simple to change as, for example, the length
	of your femur.

	That would require specification of what "better" means.
	Who decides what is "better?"  As for bettering yourself,
	too late.  Most genes work through their influence on
	growth and development, and it\'s pretty tricky trying to
	manipulate the genes in every cell in the brain (not to 
	mention those in other parts of the body that may interact.

	I am very concerned about the negative influence that
	religeous (and other) fanatics have on research and 
	scientific advancement, but that does not mean that every
	criticism of advancement should be dismissed.  I happily
	consume genetically engineered food, but such engineering
	is very different from the selective breeding that has
	given us our domesticated breeds of plants and animals.
	We should all be concerned.

	I am not saying that seeing things in a different way is
	a problem.  I am only pointing out that boosting the Int
	of neo-humans may result in a race of beings that many
	old-type humans would not like.  That is neither inherently

	It is not just people trying to deny Int to computers, the

	understood.

	This is a good point for Traveller: the distinction between

	Sadly true, there is a great Monty Python skit on this:

I\'ll have to run that past my wife when she gets home later this week.
She\'s the morbid one in the family, and owns numerous cheerful books with

and so forth.  Decay processes are a forte of hers.  She\'ll know if the

Yeah, now that you lay out the argument, I tend to concur.  Your best bet
would probably be to go for a relatively high overpressure, to float high
in the water, since air is a poorer heat conductor than water.  Basically,
treat the suit as a snug man-shaped life raft.  Even then, you end up
lying against the inner surface of the outer shell of the suit, but
hopefully the h/c fluid network can keep this interface up to a reasonable
temperature for a while.

Yeah, that\'s precisely what I had in mind.  And I think 10-ish atm
pressure is about what a BD suit should be able to take, which is why I
picked the 100 m depth in my post.

Note to you: Be sure to express it as a pressure primarily, with perhaps
the equivalent Terran ocean depth parenthetically.  Depth will vary based
on local gravity, atmospheric pressure, and so forth (and fluid, for that
matter, if you include non-water \'oceans\').

I\'d suggest a safe sustained operating limit of 10 atm, with certain-death
sustained load around 15 atm and a peak transient load (e.g., from
explosive overpressure waves) of perhaps 20 atm.  You can leave off the
latter two in the interests of simplicity; the peak-transient can actually
be considered as factored into the suit\'s defensive value within the
combat system.

Well, if you just use the Vehicles computation for crush depth, there won\'t be much trouble exceeding those figures.  Crush depth in Vehicles is a multiple of DR, which is why the Intrepit has a crush depth of 140 miles....

You know, ISTR that Rob Prior\'s Traveller software is written in a Pascal?
Perhaps it could be ported to Linux if the GUI could be sorted?

Notice that "Socialism/Communism" Governments are not listed as Government
Types in the UWP? These kinds of governments and the concept of
nationalization of private industry is as much an antithesis of the 3I as it
was to the U.S. The 3I would simply not let it happen. After all the
Imperium takes to itself not just the space between worlds, but whatever it
deems important for its own survival. It is in reality a mercantile empire.
The Emperor controls the military and claims fealty from the Imperial Nobles
beneath him, but the Emperor is incredibly rich because he claims stock
(i.e. ownership) in the great and small Corps and Megacorps. The Imperial
Nobles and rich and shepherd their Domains, Sectors and Subsectors for many
reasons, but one is because it\'s good for business. Their business, since
they hold stock and real estate in these same Domains, Sectors and
Subsectors.

Socialism -- it just ain\'t gonna happen. The INI would charge the government
members with real or imagined charges before a Ducal Court. The IMJ would be
investigating the sins of all involved. As a last resort the Imperial
Marines would land to prevent the theft of the property of innocent Imperial
Citizens (like all those nice off-world Megacorp stockholders -- many of
whom are Imperial Nobles themselves). Then a nice capitalistic leaning
government would be install, be it a Charismatic Oligarchy or a Impersonal
Bureaucracy.

Still a nice plot hook to have the PC\'s there while all this is playing out.
It might be fun just watching them trying to survive it.

I\'d like that translation - it would make the ship suitable form that 
starship showcase thing launched on downport some months ago.

I did consider doing the deckplans myself but had colder feet than those
guys posted to the Aleutians. My last attempt at 3D modelling got as far
as a table...flat top, leg at each corner. Then I rotated it - any
association between the legs and top was just an optical illusion.

I assume that the only solution to learning 3-D modelling involves the
loss ofa couple of months sleep.

He also points out that in Book 4, Instruction skill was introduced
allowing someone to gain a skill that the instructor knows in 6-week
cram session or a 6 month "night school" type of course. They point
out that this skill should be used sparingly and I can see why. This
would mean that if any of my teachers had had instruction skill they
would\'ve been able to give me Skill-1 in anything in one semester.

I think I\'ve downgraded myself to Electronics-1.

The resume is more like:

Computer Geek:
term 1: hacking (in the good sense of the word) unix machines, programming
         game machines in assembly language. Some screwing w/ hardware.
term 2: Assembly language graphics device drivers. Later on C on unix.
         Some more hardware. Pascal!

term 4: some assembly language, a _small_ amount of FORTRAN, C/C++, and all
         those neat things that keep appearing, ActiveX, COM, DHTML, ATL,
         trying to learn Java in my free time, but I no longer have the

J-Space in the near future, lights blinking to the tune of a "Space Hog"
song. They were really just looking for a Gas Giant to fuel up at, but
they notice the radio transmissions coming from the habitable zone. Since
they are fleeing from the Law in this uncharted zone of space, they don\'t
dare make contact, but one day, in a cornfield near my house... (Okay, up
to the cornfield part it seemed OK)

Notice, no level-0 skills. What are they? Are they something like this

There are a couple of government types that would fill the
Socialist/Communist role:

Gov\'t 1: Corporation.  If the Party is the company, and the Workers are all
shareholders, then it\'s a Marxist dream come true!  Elect the Management
from the rank and file.

Gov\'t 2: Participating Democracy.  Another utopian take on the idea.
Everybody of a certain age is a member of the Party, and everybody votes.
Heinlein\'s Starship Troopers comes to mind, with Party membership
restricted to veterans.

Gov\'t 3: Self Perpetuating Oligarchy.  The People\'s republic of China after
Mao would be a good example.. ruled by an inner circle of Party members,
who don\'t need to answer to those they rule over.

Gov\'t 8 or 9:  Civil Service Bureaucracy and Impersonal Bureaucracy.  Both
good "ground level views of the communist systems.  "The Party has
determined that you are over your quota for air this quarter, comrades.
Please adjust your breathing accordingly.  Spacebo."

Gov\'t A: Charismatic Dictator.  Josef Stalin, Mao, Fidel Castro.. Communist
regimes seem to end up being a haven for dictators.

You could make a case for Gov\'t D: Religious Dictatorship.  Given some of
the utterly bizarre assumptions made by Soviet scientists (esp. Lysenko) in
accordance with Marxist theory, you could have fun with this one.

And of course Gov\'t F: Totalitarian Oligarchy.  The sons of the Party get
the best, while the Workers slave away.

Socialism and Communism are economic theories.  Remember, the Soviet Union
had an elected assembly.. there was just one party invited of course...

<weg>

Level-0 implies sufficient basic familiarity to allow the person to use
the skill under normal, non-stressful conditions. The most common
skill level zero skills in canon adventures are a weapon skill (one
per person) and Vacc suit skill. Vacc-0 would allow you to put on
a vacc suit safely in a spacious airlock and walk carefully across
the surface of an airless world without killing yourself. It wouldn\'t
allow you to put on a vacc suit in the dark while atmosphere rushes
out of a holed ship around you, except by luck.

I rate myself as carbine-0, bow-0 and survival-0. I know how to load,
aim, and fire a light rifle with some success at relatively easy targets,
but I\'ve never used one while other people were running around and
shooting at me. (That was paintball.) I can use a bow and arrow
without hurting myself, and I have a smattering of survival training
that is more book-based than experience-based to go along with
about five years of intermittent woodcraft training in the Boy Scouts.

I didn\'t put in History-0, or any other knowledge skills at 0 because I 
figured that my Education score would cover that.

six weeks and Instructor skill?

make the player a scout on an exploration mission, a naval cruiser on a

	[Steve replied]  To delurk for a moment:  FWIW I imported the plans
for the Scout into the quake2 engine (more as a learning exercise as
anything), so you could walk around inside it and see what it\'s like.  It\'s
interesting - I realized immediately that the centrally-located floor irises
(just outside of the engine room) are horribly arranged - talk about a
congested passage!  It really gives you a feel for how cramped the thing is.

	If anyone has other plans that don\'t involve a lot of curves and
would like to see them in firsthand view, I\'d be happy to take a shot at
them.  Email me seperately.

Faster way to pump up the pressure: open all interal valves and doors (but
not the Airlocks, inner nor outer), and vent all the plasma from the drives
into the atmosphere...you will get a heat flash, and a pressure wave,
probably not enough to do more than blow down partitions, but you will melt
the engineering wiring and consoles, for the most part. And the chairs...
And, assuming you\'ve got the h2 pumped up along with the right o2 levels, a
preife flash fire to preheat the rest of the ship...

Then, repeat venting by running all remaining fuel through the JDrivve, and
venting internally, assuming it was in another compartment, or at least not
in the venting patern.

FWIW, The MegaTraveller Journal #1 lists Battle Dresses as being able to withstand pressures up to 600-1000 ATM (depending on the specific model), which does seem kind of reasonable to me.

One of my players scuba-dives, and he\'s told me a lot about diving. In their normal suits, they often dive to 60-70 meters (IIRC), which means 7-8 ATM. That\'s pretty safe, but greater depths are possible in just an ordinary wet-suit, if caution is exercised.

Granted, there\'s still a long way to go to the 600-1000 ATM, but isn\'t battle dress the ultimate suit?

On several occasions, I\'ve used battle dresses\' ability to operate on extreme depths to do nice, Abyss-like adventures.

I agree with this. I-War is one of the most realistic and fun space sims I
have ever played. The nice thing about I-War is that they use realistic
vector thrusting for your ship. This is coupled to your computer that will
auto fire your thrusters to maintain a set speed at a particular heading.
(Note this can be turned off so you can do a strafing run on a target as
you coast by)

It is doable and not beyond the reach of the programmers on this list. The

Oops.

I\'m looking at several sources, and they all seem to show that line.

This is very odd, since the line from Lunion (2124) to Glisten (2036) runs
to Shirene (2125)then Strouden, on out of the subsector through Persephone
(2228).  Tenalphi is a nothing planet with less than one hundred sophonts
in permanent residence.. it certainly doesn\'t need *two* X-boat lines
running into it!

I can\'t even justify it as a spur route, since the main route spinward to
Five Sisters runs through Ababicci (1824), which is only 2 jumps away.
Tenalphi is a natural stopover for merchants bringing goods from Abadicci
and Lunion to Wardn or Smoug.  They\'d be able to handle news distribution
easily.

So.. we have to ask, why does this world not only have two X-boat routes
going into the system, but one of those routes a distinctly non-standard
Jump-5 route to one of the subsector\'s industrial powerhouses?  Why is
Tenalphi so sparsely populated?  Let\'s delve a bit further...

The Spinward Marches Campaign lists Tenalphi as:

A774102-E  Low Population, Non-Industrial, Ancient Site  610Im  F7v

There\'s a big clue: Tenalphi has an Ancient site.  But why the small
population?  And why the Jump-5 link?

Quick scenario idea:  Colonies on Tenalphi keep failing.. different
reasons, but they always fail.  Imperial researchers at the secret psionic
research facility at Wypoc/Lanth (Imperial Encyclopedia, page 50) noted odd
sensations and muddled memories of colony survivors.  Knowing there was an
Ancient site on world, they\'ve kept the world open for colonization
attempts, in hopes of isolating the phenomenon.  The next colonization
attempt, which is in the early settlement stages, will be heavily
infiltrated by psionic agents.  This colony is mainly being promoted by
Strouden.  The Imperium has established a temporary (no more than 30 years)
J-5 courier link between Strouden and Tenalphi to help with the effort,
along with providing advanced technology (explaining the TL-14 colony of
the TL-12 world.)

The characters can take several roles.. colonial administrators in a slowly
advancing Stephen King-like horror scenario, IISS rescuers, or even agents
of the Wypoc facility.

What\'s causing the colonies to fail?  Who knows?  But let\'s theorize a
defense mechanism that only works against sentient creatures.  It uses
neural activity sensors to detect intelligent minds, then uses resources
from weather control to bio-engineered animals to eliminate them.  Over the
aeons, its sensor net has failed, so now it can only detect minds in
certain small areas, or if there are large groupings of those minds, say
over a million or so.

So as the colony grows, explorers and homesteaders will go missing,
villages will be found abandoned, and everyone will get the feeling they
are being watched..

The hills have eyes, you know...

They are paper or cardstock alternatives to lead figures.  SJ Games made

just recently put the entire fantasy line back in print in one "book".

Hmmm... well, what the heck. I\'ll put some screen shots up on my 
web site. Please note that it\'s currently just a UI prototype - 
it doesn\'t do much, but it takes a lot of code to do so.

See http://www2.magma.ca/~ehenry/traveller/screens/

Now all I have to do is cook up a db layout and hook it in... easy, right?

There are lots of useful apps for the Palm that can be used as is 
though... the most important one probably being the memo pad,
followed closely by your favourite doc reader for bigger documents.

My main problem is the relative primitive tools available for free -
as far as I can tell, gcc for the Palm can\'t handle linking multiple
object files, so everything has to be in one source file. Ugh.

Anyone want to donate a copy of CodeWarrior for the Palm? (and before
anyone sends me a cheque, I\'m joking - we actually get the non-Palm 
version of CodeWarrior for free where I work, as we\'re a partner. I 
am the last person on the planet who need more software).

Well, as an Atheist and Archaeologist, I would guess that it\'s in Exodus (10
Commandments, being handed down to Moses on Mt Sinai after the Israelites
left Egypt but before they arrive in \'The Promised Land\'. This being the
Exodus of the title...). Exodus can\'t be more than a dozen pages of the Old
Testament, so you\'d have a pretty good chance of hitting it if you looked at
the Book/Chapter headings at the top of the page when flicking through for
it.

Just my 0.02 Talents.

Here, here.  But lest we forget those who remain behind:

Rudyard Kipling, "The Last of the Light Brigade,"
http://redfrog.norconnect.no/~poems/poems/03402.html

"There were thirty million English who talked of England\'s might, 
There were twenty broken troopers who lacked a bed for the night. 
They had neither food nor money, they had neither service nor trade; 
They were only shiftless soldiers, the last of the Light Brigade. 

They felt that life was fleeting; they knew not that art was long, 
That though they were dying of famine, they lived in deathless song. 
They asked for a little money to keep the wolf from the door; 
And the thirty million English sent twenty pounds and four! "

ObTrav (occurred to me after I posted the original):

MEMO TO:  All Imperial Navy Units

SUBJECT:  Elite Solomani Naval Units

1.  All Imperial Naval commanders are advised that extreme caution must
be used in the event that they find themselves engaging the following
Solomani vessels:

  DD JOHNSTON
  DD HOEL
  DD HEERMANN
  DE SAMUEL B. ROBERTS

2.  Imperial Naval Intelligence (INI) has determined that the
above-named ships have been manned with crews indoctrinated with the
heroic tradition of their Terran (United States\' Navy) World War II
wet-navy namesakes.

3.  INI estimates that the crews of these vessels, if engaged, will
fight with such skill and tenacity as to be equivalent to normal
cruisers.

I can hope, can\'t I?  :-)

I\'m glad people are finding interesting things on the deckplans ring.

I was just reading TODAY (talk about coincidence, eh?) about the deluxe

I\'ll have to go back to the website tomorrow and look around for those files

The Skylark of Valeron *or* the DQ would be great for scaring the
living <bleep> out of characters.

Though their sizes were never given, we know they contain thousand
kilometer (diameter? Radius?) "setting circles" for the main 6th order
projector. And that these were apparently intact after attacks that
peeled off tens of miles of hull and armor.

My guess is that they have a UPP of 300???-Z. 

And thus they put the Death Star in its place. These aren\'t going to be
mistaken for a small *moon*. Try a small *planet*.

But wouldn\'t it be fun having the party conducting business on a planet
with "The Stuff" doing it\'s thing in the background? Even more fun if
you can get them to try you-know-what.

Well, it could be ice cream, could be frozen yogurt, all we know for
sure is that it\'s white, and semi-solid.

>How should one figure out their ratings?

We\'re all winging it.  I figure:
level 0: basic familiarity (basic first aid)
level 1: above minimum skill (first reponder)
level 2: experienced (EMT)
level 3: more experienced (doctor)
level 4: expert (specialist)
level 5: top of the field
Peez


Here be my take. . . .

			RL/Fiction examples
level 0: Adept		Undergoing training 
level 1: Proficient	Completed (successfully) training
level 2: Skilled		Been in job for several years
level 3: Very Skilled	Can serve as an instructor*
level 4: Expert		Need no explanation
level 5: Mastery		Top of field; Jackie Chan\'s, Barishnakov\'s
(me bad speller), Han Solo\'s (piloting), Leonard . . .

Admittedly it\'s kinda a rip off FASA\'s mechanics of the late 80\'s, early
90\'s, but it serves well. Of course for those with exceptional stats being
tacked onto their skill that can only improve (Han probably having a dex in
Trav of E/F combined with his piloting skill of 5 or so can fly through an
asteroid field that has an average survival probability of in in 3k . . .) 

*	I noticed that many USAF pilots generally return after one or two
years after completing training to serve as instructors. But given the time,
effort, money and exhaustive testing this seems to be completely feasible. 

Er . . . that\'s my 0.02 Creds (Impies, Sols etc.)

Uhmm, thats 6,000 to 10,000 meters. IIRC thats way deeper than most of the
world\'s oceans. I\'d suggest a range more along the lines of 60 to 100 atm
(which gives 600 to 1,000 meters at T-norm).

From memory the maximum depth for diving is around 200 meters???

A suggestion.  *DON\'T* shoot the PHB.  15 to life is a big price to pay for 1

They were basically miniatures sized.  25mm, IIRC.  Been awhile since I\'ve seen some IRL.
