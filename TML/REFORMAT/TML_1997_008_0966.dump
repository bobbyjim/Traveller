well, feel free, but be aware that that the entire backround is based on the
speed of travel being 168-hours a jump.

My web browser like that ever worse. I have the table in html form, but
having no idea what it should look like I am unable to piece it together. If
some one could please send me the basic layout I can probably figure it out
from there, I hope.=20

btw, whoever did the proof reading for T4 should, imho, be made to do some
kind of penance. How did such a typo/ommision ridden product ever make it to
the shelves?

There\'s clearly a lot of kinetic energy in the ESB asteroid field that had
to come from _somewhere_ recently.  Still, that\'s one of my favorite
scenes. :)

Related to your second comment, doesn\'t the density vary somewhat?  And
won\'t some asteroids orbit each other in small close groups by mutual
attraction?

How thick is the asteroid belt in our system?  How thick are Saturn\'s rings?

I\'m surprised no-one else has mentioned this before.  A battle area filled
with detnuke missle going off will cause sensor operators fits as they try
to keep track of what\'s happening beyond the explosions.

3G3 is the God of weapons design.. I\'m still working up stuff for my
Traveller campaign using it, I\'ll post them later.  All of the weapons in EA
was designed using 3G3.

In the IG catalog I recieved recently, the new FF&S is scheduled for a June
release, so expect it in July or August.

I\'m a realist, so I saw 15 *dice*.. having a stream of plasma hit you is
going to hurt.  If it is a limb hit, remember that he can only take up to
the hit capacity of that limb, then it\'s gone..

I can never remember what the acronym means, but it is a design contest for
ships in the Milieu:0 setting.  The difference is that we also role-play our
companies, providing press releases claiming our ships are the best thing
since sliced bread.  We just finished the April THUDD, which was a contest
to design a patrol cruiser.

The way it works is that Paul, or whoever is running it this week, puts out
a call for designs.  This will include the mission requirements and any
restrictions on size, weapons, etc.  Then we all go to work and submit our
designs to the moderator, who posts the designs and ballot.

biographies to introduce myself.

Those who frequent Usenet newsgroups have probably seen me around. I\'m Steve
Miller, and I\'m a editor/writer/game designer with a degree in English with a
Creative Writing Emphasis from the University of Utah. I grew up in Europe
(Denmark, primarily), and started my role-playing hobby on "Star Frontiers"
from TSR. 

As a kid, I decided that I wanted to make my living as a writer or editor,
and so far I\'ve been able to just that. I\'ve worked as an entertainment
writer, features editor, PR writer, script writer, and more recently as a
games editor/designer. Since making my hobby my vocation as well, I\'ve worked
on staff at TSR, and am presently freelancing for Archangel Entertainment and
White Wolf... and have also contributed to an upcoming T4 adventure anthology
from Imperium Games. I\'ll soon be taking over the editorial reins of the
"Star Wars Journal" at West End Games.

It\'s only recently that I discovered TRAVELLER -- early 1995 to be exact --
when I bought the TNE and MT boxed sets, and gathered a group of my then
co-workers at TSR for a weekly TNE campaign. [Note: I realise a lot of
TRAVELLER fans dislike the New Era material, but I personally have a hard
time seeing a difference between what "Mileu 0" campaigns will most likely be
centered around, and what New Era campaigns would most likely have been
centered around. Both settings are about picking up the pieces of a dead
empire and rediscovering "what\'s out there". The only thing I could see about
TNE that was utterly abominable was the way they approached Virus. I hope I\'m
not stirring up an old flamewar... or opening myself up to "You don\'t get
TRAVELLER, you jerk!"] 

At any rate, when the anthology comes out, at least one of the designers will
be hanging around the mailing list for you to shout at. :)

Check the IG web site.  The hardback listed there is the Deluxe T4 
Hardback.  The softback listed there is the original softback (i.e., not 
"Deluxe").  

It has not been printed yet.  The catalog lists it as having a May 
release date, if I recall correctly.  But I\'m guessing June is closer to 
reality (just my humble opinion), since it is still being worked on right 
now.

My friend, astronomers have *all* the answers. :)  No, Hollywood and (bad)
science fiction representations of asteroid belts have almost no
resemblance to the genuine article.  In Sol\'s belt, and any other
long-term stable belt, even in the thickest parts it would be *very* rare
for any asteroid to be naked-eye visible (even as a 5th-magnitude speck)
from any other.

As you mention, part of the reason is that asteroids that are still around
tend to be in orbits that don\'t cross the orbits of other large asteroids;
those that *did* cross have already collided with one another and become
swarms of smaller asteroids, some of which collided with other asteroids
and got still smaller, others of which ended up in stable new orbits, and
still others of which plonked the inner planets. Some really surprising
fraction of meteorites on Earth, for example, are believed to be fragments
chipped off Vesta (IIRC) by collisions with much smaller bodies; Vesta is
very big, and in an especially thick part of the belt, so ends up (over
the very long term) taking more "sandblasting" than most asteroids.

The other factor is of course that the density of the Belt is very low. 
There are tens of thousands of sizeable asteroids (>1km diameter), but
they are spread out through a flattened torus between about 2 and 4 AU
from the sun, maybe 1/4 AU thick...and that\'s a *log* of volume to spread
out in. 

There was an 80s SF story set on an asteroid-mining colony in which one
scene involved most of the crew going outside in p-suits to watch another
asteroid go by close enough to show a (small) angular diameter to the
naked eye.  It was the first time this had happened in the many years
they\'d been there.  It really brought home to me what the Belt is actually
like.

The key is "degrees".  Both homosexuality and use of children
for sex have been generally considered unacceptable but have
situations where they have acheived "degrees" of acceptance.
The whole thing is usually subject to various spins, but I
don\'t see any objective evidence the homosexuality has been
historically more accepted.  How if you want to restrict
this to sex with very young babies (ie 1 or 2 years old)
I agree that there is a general rejection of practice.

Bzzzt.  People have been claiming that since CT -- I think it was actually
asserted in LBB 2 -- but it\'s never been true.  Consider two stationary
ships A and B, and a ship C moving in the + Z direction at 1 unit per
second.  In this diagram, the numbers give Z coordinates:

    A (0)

              C (-5)

    B (0)

Presume that A and B are 5 units apart, and that the projection of C\'s
position onto the Z=0 plane is 5 units from each.

Now, initially, C is sqrt(5^2 + 5^2) =~ 7 units from both A and B.  As it
moves up the Z axis (without accelerating), however, it draws closer to
both ships; it\'s only 5 units from both of them as it passes Z=0.  Then,
continuing to move up-Z, it draws further away from A and B; it\'s 7 units
away again as it passes Z=+5.

So, with no ship accelerating, C starts off 7 units away, moves to 5 units
away, then back to 7 units away, from each of two spatially separated
ships.  You *can\'t* model that on a plane!

For *two* ships, a suitable change of coordinates (both velocity and
position) will allow you to fudge things onto a plane -- but not for
three.  I\'ve kept silent about this for 19 years...it\'s good to have it
off my chest. :)

  For what it\'s worth (which is, I know, not a whole lot) I realized that
the above (written from memory) is slightly different than the "original"
written version.

1) I messed up the order of the UPP (HOW long have I been playing this
game?)  Plus I got a value wrong-- it should have been 568BA7

2) On my original "skills" listing, I also had "Music-2" and didn\'t have
the point of "Research"-- these skills came from the two auto skills, 4
backgrounds chosen from the list, and 4 college skills chosen off the
list.  As written, I wouldn\'t make much of a Traveller PC, but I still
thought it was pretty neat that I was able to come up with a reasonable
facsimile of myself by actually following the rules.

3) A few more "skills" which don\'t really exist, but which I consider
some of my primary aptitudes:
Trivia (Movies)-3
Trivia (Literature)-3
Trivia (Music)-2
Trivia (Games)-2

Thanks for indulging, I hope I\'m not wasting too terribly much bandwidth,

Sure, you can change it.  You can set it up anyway you want, but if you
allow communications much faster than the ~ one week per parsec, you\'ll
change the *feel* of the game.  Of course, there\'s nothing wrong with that,
if that\'s what you want.

Well yeah, Sid Vicious *did* cross my mind when I named Sid Nastie,
seeing as Nastie is a drug lord (among the rest of his nefarious
affairs), and poooor Sid Vicious is a stone cold junkie.  No, I\'m
not mixing up my tenses either.

I meant to respond to this earlier.  In my games, jump is basically through
an artificially created wormhole (did you get that out of the *long*
articles I posted recently ;->).  Where you end up is a factor of how well
the Astrogator resolves a sensor signal from a grav source, and how
accurately he fires the pulse of anti-gravitrons at that source. If there
is an up-to-date datafile (or chart), the sensors are in well-repair and
are rated at that distance, the grav pulse generator is fired accurately,
and the Astrogator is successful at the two Average tasks of Locating and
Linking, the ship will get where it\'s going and emerge *somewhere* on the
"hyperlimit" in that system. ;-> With up-to-date charts and a Difficult
task for Location and Linking, they can jump in at their *choice* of
location on the hyperlimit (of course, if they fail either task they
increase their chances of a misjump).  Without the charts, they take their
chances on where they end up.

Remember, I\'m a heretic.  <g> I don\'t have a *conceptional* problem
changing acceleration rates, or using pseudo-velocity.  Keep in mind, I was
just laying out alternatives, that you should consider if you want to use 1
minute turns.

> Doesn\'t matter. The weapons *will* have that kind of range...

Two points:

1.  What kind of *real* destructive range does a laser have
*without* the total handwave of gravitic focusing?  According to FFS, less
than *1* hex!  (p.  125) We could rework Grav Focusing to work across
shorter ranges...if we wanted to.

2.  I\'ve always had a problem with NPAWS and Meson cannon firing out to
multi-mega km.  Maybe they really *can*, but I have my doubts about NPAWS
beams staying together that far...and the very existance of Meson guns is a
big stretch.

Assuming, weapons can do damage at such ranges.  If they can\'t then they\'ll
have to close, and you\'ll probably get what I discribe below.

Which is also probably realistic, not that I particularly *like* it.

You might find that typical battles are:

1.  Meeting actions at high relative velocities where the ships pass into
and out of weapon range in only a few minutes.

2.  Actions where one, or both, sides deaccelerate for all they are worth
so as to extend combat time.

3.  A long stern chase where if you have an acceleration edge you\'ll
eventually bring the enemy into long range, medium range, then short range. 
And if you don\'t have an acceleration edge you\'re just plain SOL.

4.  Or finally, if you are some place the enemy wants to be (gas
giant/planet/jump-point), and they\'ve got to decelerate down to your
position and kill or be killed.

Slugging it out at relatively low velocity differences would be *very*
deadly, I\'d think.  Even Admirals of closely matched fleets would avoid
this kind of fight, probably, preferring to "remain an intact force" rather
than risk complete destruction.  This is why I think they would prefer
multiple high velocity passing actions, followed by a long period of
deceleration and repair, out of range. This would often give the side
getting beaten a chance to refuse action by jumping out.

Everything, of course, IMO. ;->

Hum, I\'m picturing the computing power greater per stere than that, but not
much.  An XT in one suitcase, ship computers and MFD\'s the size of a large
refridgerator each, and bulky console sized data terminals.  Holo-tanks
exist for astrogation, piloting and CIC, but they are small and require
*big* computers.

	If I remember right, this only blocks LOS of passive sensors 
through the white out hex, though I think it\'d probably cause a blackout 
of active sensors as well. The effects only last for a turn, but that 
would be long enough for a missle to slip through.

	Good. I was wondering how compatible it would be. I used to have 
a carbine design, using a TL10 10mm ETC cartridge with an energy of 
about 1400-1800J, and an Bla (average barrel length to achieve this 
energy) of 14.8cm. With a 33cm barrel, you get damage performance equal 
to a 7mm ACR, with better range and a lighter weapon. I was gonna miss 
that gun...

	I was just confused by the relationship Penetration Value = 
Damage Value X Penetration Rating. 15 Dice makes sense, though.

	BTW, does anyone have an idea of when the next THUDDD will 
start? I was hping to get a crack at this before I left.

	It stands for Tml Highly Unofficial and Democratic Design Derby.  I
ran the first two, Paul Walker is handling the current one, and one of the
Berry brothers is probably going to do the next one.

	Basically, we all enjoyed the January Ship design contest so much
that we decided to do it on our own; the person running it announces it (we
have a list of ship classes chosen by popular vote that we\'re slowly
working through), people submit designs, which are then posted on the TML,
the TML votes upon them with comments, and the results are posted, along
with said comments.

	It\'s been an interesting exercise; we\'ve thoroughly tested QSDS and
SSDS, discussed numerous design and economics issues, and had quite a good
time at it.  As well, we\'ve produced a bunch of (sometimes very interesting
and offbeat) ship designs, which anyone is free to use...

Hey! ;->

Paul, you\'re restating a hunk of my "Aptitude Based Character
Generation", mark 1.  Your analysis is exactly as I see it too, different
people will learn at different rates based on their aptitude for that skill
AND due to environmental factors.

Therefore, skill point increases should be based on both an aptitude score,
and a random factor for environmental differences.

I\'m ending up with numbers *way* too high for use using Ken\'s Task levels
(and we actually agree there), but I\'m dividing the point total by 5,dn for
the final skill level.  Experience increases the skill points, so each 1
point increase is worth 1/5 of a skill level. 

More about this later,

I was going to say \'Treat it as an explosion\' but then I looked up the
rules. In TW2000 they had a rule that you took either the conncussion or the
penetration value in D6\'s if an explosion occurred in contact. As TNE has
increased conncussion damage for contact explosions, I\'d only check the
penetration. This would give the 15D6 answer.

	The Mark 11 reentry vehicle (that\'s the business end of an ICBM, for you
non-warmongers out there) had a balsa heat shield. When I took a class at
Vandenberg AFB, they had one that\'d been used for a test shot from Vandy to
Kwajalein. The cone drifted off and was found by some fishermen six months
later, and 4,000 miles away (or some such ridiculous numbers).

Douglas is absolutely correct. I would say that if you don\'t like the 7-day
jump period, play Star Wars!

Seriously, the jump lag time is so crucial to the history of Traveller, no
one should really consider changing it. Unfortunately, many science fiction
films have ingrained the idea in the collective consciousness that
interstellar travel is a piece of cake. In reality, we\'re just guessing at
one way the laws of physics might be broken.

Okay, but what _are_ some of the changes in the feel of the game if you
went with, say, a 1-day jump (the famed Lucas Drive that lets one-man
fighters traverse the galaxy all the way to Dagobah!), an
Alderson-point-like drive, a "we\'re just going really really fast" ST:NG
warp-like drive, or some other style of FTL travel?  What are the
ramifications of each in general?

Oof.

Okay, speculation time: Will there be any device invented in the next 1-10

If so, what is it?  

The only thing I could come up with off-hand is 3D protein pigment memory

been kicking the idea around in my head a bit more.

Basically, the idea was that a planetbound population of humans had been
contacted by the Hiver during the Long Night.  The Hiver, for whatever
ugly, sinister reasons they had, \'manipulated\' the humans into the closest
approximation of Hiver as they could manage -- monosexual, "reproductive
drive" replaced by "parenting instinct," nest-hive social structure,
embassies, settlement patterns, economy, the works.  At some point the
Hiver abandoned the planet and the now very peculiar humans went their own
way for a thousand years or so, developing spaceflight, fighting off some
rogue Droyne/devolved Ancients who were lurking in the outer system,
piecing together jump drive technology from them, etc.  When contact with
the outside universe is re-established, they\'re going to be something of a
curiosity -- pushing the outer limits of what other humans would consider
"human," but also wayward enough that the modern Hive Federation would look
at them as dangerous \'children\' in need of being re-uplifted...

Sounds just right.  Maybe this would imply that bio-human clans would be
more closely entwined, politically/economically, with other clans, than the
average Aslan clan?

Yeah, that\'s the main reason I didn\'t suggest it... though the idea of
habitual *male* infanticide is kind of neat.

If prior to human assimilation of Aslan culture, there wasn\'t any tradition
of cross-laborers like this, it seems unlikely to me that one would
develop.  The Aslan would probably see it as a \'barbaric\' custom and
indicative that the hairless monkeys actually *hadn\'t* acquired
civilization yet...  I dunno, but in my own mind, I sort of see the Aslan
as having fairly inflexible and impermeable gender boundaries, and with
100% matching of biological sex to socio/psychological gender.

If you want *speculation*, then sure....

Anti-gravity, gravity control or gravity shielding.

Commercial power production from some kind of Fusion.

Practical room temperture superconductors.

First generation nano-machines.


Give us another 20 years, and you can add....

Reactionless drives.

Inertial Control.

FTL transportation.

Nano-replicators.


No, I\'m not entirely serious, but I\'m not entirely joking either.

Command and Control, and Information Transfer.  One day to jump how far? If
you\'re limiting it to 1 to 6 parsecs/day then...Sector Command is 2 weeks
(or so) from anywhere in the sector, rather than several months. If you\'re
saying 1 day to half way across the galaxy then...Central Imperial Command
is two or three days from anywhere in the Imperium, rather than several
years.  Given *either* situation there will be a major change in Command
and Control.  Independent commands fade away. PC\'s won\'t be able to run
away from their rep..or the law nearly as easy because information will be
much more widely spread and *much* faster.

> Alderson-point-like drive, 

Information transfer, and Command and Control.  Alderson transfer
instantaneously, but take weeks to get out to the jump-points from inner
planets.  Physical travel will still take a long time, but information can
be jumped radioed into and back from inner planets and jumped along *much*
faster than in Traveller.  You can\'t shift forces around as fast from a
Central Command, but you will still have Centralized Control of forces and
strategies.

> "we\'re just going really really fast" ST:NG  warp-like drive, or some other >style of FTL travel?  

Same as above, varing by just how fast "really fast" is.  

All of them will tend toward less diverse cultures with the tendency toward
a homogenious Standard Imperial Culture.  Does that exist in Traveller? 
Yes, but it\'s mainly among *travellers*, and around the central
systems..say sector capitals.  Is it more in 1100 than in 100?  You bet! 
But not nearly as bad as with rapid information transfer.

Anybody else?

This one, unless Douglas has outmaneuvered me. :)  I\'m also not sure if
I\'ll be in on May or June.  Paul?  In any case, we should start deciding
now what the May design will be.  A heavy fighter seems popular, but can\'t
be done in QSDS.  Once Paul and I decide who gets May, one of us will
figure out what the May contest will be.

I\'ve inaugurated a web page to track the THUDDDs:

  http://www.cinenet.net/users/cberry/thuddd.html

It\'s (needless to say) under construction, and doesn\'t have the April
THUDDD entries -- probably won\'t before voting closes, given my work load
this week. :(  When I take over THUDDD, I plan on having this site be the
only place where the full designs appear, with just an announcement to the
TML (and ISBA) list to let people know to look.  Anybody object to that?

I\'m always amazed and pleased to see what other people can pull off with
design systems I think I understand.  It\'s both fascinating and
educational, and will (I hope) continuously improve the state of the art
in Traveller design systems *and* designs.

By the way, I\'m mulling over Mark Clark\'s suggestion for a second round
competition among the best designs, with further tweaks allowed.  My
counterproposal is that we occasionally redo an old THUDDD topic, with the
benefit of hindsight, the published winners of the last round, and any new
or changed design systems published in the interim.  That sound attractive
to anyone?

You don\'t need to consider two ships; one ship can change its velocity in

I loved the asteroid scene in ESB so much I HAD to include it in my old
campaign. The way I handwaved it was to postulate a stable asteroid swarm
in a gas giant\'s trojan point, whose orbits were chaotic because of
perturbations from another planet. My players had to fly into this
nightmare to retrieve a valuable cargo jettisoned by a ship attacked by
pirates. Anyone with an astronomy background wanna tell me how many laws of
physics I broke?

Lemme guess; you\'re trying to figure out how ships can survive misjump. We
bashed around this same idea in my old campaign. Some things you\'ll have to
consider are: why the gravity potential isn\'t required for normal jumps;
why ships don\'t misjump into even larger gravity wells like, say, the
inside of a star; or why gravity would even be required at all since normal
jumps have to take place far AWAY from gravity wells.

Another problem is why, if misjumps aren\'t deadly, don\'t scout or trade
ships intentionally misjump to get better range. A little mismaintenance,
some impure fuel, and helooo jump 36!

Well, the smiley was there because it\'s a fudge, but instantaneously
they are always in a plane (obviously).  You are right that they
aren\'t in _the same plane_ thoughout the game, though.  They are
always in a plane by definition, it just changes to an outside
observer. And projecting them to yet another plane is even more
screwy as you show.

:-)

So, the bottom line is that it isn\'t really 3d out of the box, nor
is it easy to play out in 3d at all (unless you do it on a
computer).  I\'ll be more careful about the inside jokes (being
aware of the claims made in the past to the effect that it is/was).

The film view of asteroid belts is not very realistic. Our own asteroid
belt is much more sparse. I think I remember that the Galileo probe to
Jupiter went through the asteroid belt and passed one asteroid close
enough to photograph it. (Perhaps a few thousand kilometers ?) 

So if one went through a real asteroid field, it would be hard to see any
asteroids by naked eye.

I have studied one year, mostly general courses. I was in the Finnish Army
for eight months beginning last July, and learnt there something about
firearms, explosives and such. Very little, mind you.

Currently I am employeed by one of Finlands biggest telecommunications
companies as a summer trainee. I program network management applications
with C++. 

I have played RPGs since 1986 or something like that. First game was D&D
(of course), when the Finnish translation hit the market. FOr a couple of
years, that was enough. After that for about three years we played almost
every game which sounded interesting. AD&D, RuneQuest, Star Frontier,
ElfQuest, Marvel Super Heroes, Heroes Unlimited, Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles, Star Wars, Cyberpunk, Shadowrun... Mostly we played every of
these games for a couple of months and then switched to the next one.
RuneQuest and Shadowrun were our favorites, some of my friends still play
them. Then I went to highscool and somehow found new friends who played
RPGs. 

We started two or three AD&D campaings. One of them is still running after
almost four years of erratic playing, and two charactrers are already
second level (not very high-level campaing B-) 

I have played Vampire and Call of  Cthulhu occasionally. 

I bought MT when it came out. It sounded interesting, but I never had the
time to run a campaing, so I never played it. I bought TNE about a year
ago, and am still planning a campaing for it. 

I read this list because it is interesting, and I might someday run a
Traveller game...

Are you referring to Western Europe?  Classical Mediterranean?  This is
very culture specific.  There is a lot of ethnohistorical and
anthropological/historical evidence concerning recognition and

When you say "device" I assume you mean "computing device", since I think 
the next real society impacting technologies will come in the biology 
(viz. cloning and genetics debates) and power production fields (cheap & 
light Fuel Cells, maybe even fusion?)

I\'m not up on the current "buzz" but I remember some technologies such as 
holographic data storage, optical computing and switching, nanotechnology 
allowing tunnelling of one electron wide gates. Course, then you get into 
realm of quantum mechanics.

I think I read something about quantum mechanical based computing devices 
in Scientific American. Bizarre stuff.

You ~could~ do that. But then you\'d have to keep track of a character\'s 
*apparent* age vs. a character\'s *real* age. For instance, if subjective 
time is instantaneous, and the character makes 52 one week jumps, that 
character looks 1 year younger than he is.

And imagine all the money players would save on life-support costs! 
That\'ll wreck a bit of canon, there. Also, I could sit outside a gas 
giant and make myself a nice time machine. (forwards, anyways) Jump. 
refuel. jump. refuel. jump. refuel. Let\'s see if "the man" can catch me

At least low berths have a little danger involved. (Would you trust 
anyone to act as a "caretaker" to your berth... and what if the doctor 
botches your wake-up call... or what if the power fails...)

IMHO it\'s more trouble than it\'s worth. And it will break established 
Traveller background just as easily as if one changed jump-time from 1 
week. In different ways, but it\'ll break it just the same.

I think there are two _major_ effects of a fixed 1 week jump time on the 
development of Traveller background:

1. Information takes time to propogate.

Because of this, the Imperium\'s feudal system makes some sense. The 
Emperor can\'t directly influence everything. There isn\'t a "chain of 
command" per se. The lower nobles have direct control over week-to-week 
happenings, and only bow to the authority of the higher nobles and on up 
to the emperor if they really botch things up.

2. Those with resources have better information.

If you\'ve got high-jump capable vessels, and a string of refueling 
depots, you can beat the information lag of the average citizen by days, 
or even weeks. Arrival Vengence described how Norris got the inside scoop 
on Virus and was able to shore up the defences. He could also declare 
himself archduke because he knew of the rebellion before everyone else.

So by changing the one week travel time, you undermine the forces at work 
that reinforce the Imperial feudal system, you change the development of 
wars, exploration and trade that have shaped the Imperium, and mess up a 
lot of Norris\' shenanigans which add so much flavour to Imperial History. 
(errrr... future... whatever)

Of course, If you\'re not playing with published Imperial history, it 
doesn\'t matter. Use whatever FTL that turns your fancy.

No, no. Quite the opposite. I brought this up because I *want* it to be 
difficult to find the deep space object, and I was looking for 
justification for making it so. I assume that in the middle of nowhere, 
finding dark matter even within a few light-seconds is a non-trivial task.

Again, I ask, is my intuitive guess off base here?

I have considered the points you brought up.

My rebuttal:

A ship can only *enter* realspace with a specific gravitic potential. 
(not too great, not too small) It can enter jumpspace anywhere it darn 
well pleases, but high gravity increases the danger.

I don\'t have a problem with this one way mapping. To put it another way, 
all realspace points map to jumpspace, but all jumpspace points map to 
only some realspace points.

Why do I bother, you ask? I like the idea of system jump-points. A 
predicted distance at which a ship can appear. It stops sneaks from 
refueling in Oort belts. If the realspace<-->jumpspace map is symmetrical 
in both directions, what\'s the arguement *against* jumping to within 10 
diameters and cutting down on insystem travel time?

Besides, with this system in place, I can do away with that whole 1000 
diameter thruster plate limit stuff...

Well, as I said, I didn\'t want to make misjumps less deadly, there\'s 
always a chance of catastrophic destruction. Most scouts and trade ships 
don\'t like to take that gamble. Also, direction is random, so jump-36 
could put you waaaay far away from the direction you wished to explore.

I view a Jump as a bit like a projectile being shot from a gun barrel - the
arc of the trajectory can be influenced by:

air resistance (my Jump space is not a homogeneous \'substance\' and can thus
have thicker and thinner bits in it - generally only differing between Jump
levels, but with minor variations within a level),

wind and gravity (I assume that the effects of gravitational fields within
\'real space\' map to Jump space, hence the 100 Jump limit rules and also
giving a close fit with the famous Han Solo speech about if you\'re not
careful putting in the jump coordinates you could end up flying right
through a star, etc. - you can\'t fly/Jump through Jump space too close to
such a large gravitational field or you\'d get precipitated out of Jump)

initial velocity and \'angle\' (Jump grid set up, etc.).

The end result is that you\'ll arrive somewhere near your intended target
area, with some time uncertainty (but without having to relate distances and
times to \'c\'). Misjumps are where the gun was drastically overpowered, or
the projectile\'s path was drastically skewed in flight. Given that J space
is 3D with potentially huge gravity sources in it, a misjump might
effectively divert the projectile angle upwards, i.e. much increasing the
length (and time) of its flight.

Hand wave, hand wave.

I\'ve been toying with the idea of requiring jump entry and jump exit with
the same potential energy ie m/r has to be constant where m is the mass od
the planet or star and r is tha distance to the center of the planet or
star. This makes it impossible to jump to deepspace and if a misjump occurs
it will be to the closest/largest mass with same potential (this also
solves the conservation of enrgy problem with jumping between different
potentials). Note that I\'ve been toying with the idea, not doing any
calculations on it.

On a 2D plane when doing random walk you\'ll get on the average SQRT(N) away
from the starting point AND also any other given point (please correct me
if I remember this wrong). Thus by forcing a misjump you\'ll on the average
get further away from your destination so forced misjumps would only be a
last resort (actually one of my players won a Glisten-Mora ship race by
unintentionally misjumping the right way)

  "Feel of the game?"  More precisely, to the extent that the background

"Lucas Drive (tm)".  The Imperium makes no sense, nor does its\'
military, political, social, or economic histories.  The map area
is too small, and the Galaxy now becomes small enough for Star Wars.
That\'s really not a dig, but it does make the *T* universe nonsense.

>Alderson-point-like drive.  Surpringly little difference for *T*.
In fact, Jump is faster for transit, as that universe uses (very
efficient) reaction drives to get to and from the outer system
Alderson points.  An emergency x-boat system would be _very_ fast,
but even fast liners would take much longer.

"we\'re just going really really fast" - FTL equivalent?  Actually,
I used to prefer Pipers\' hyperdrive for serious SF, but I have to
lean towards stutterwarp now, as it covers both M-drive and FTL

fails on the "pushing on the star" math. Can\'t we change the math?

"or some other style".  Too vague a mechanism.  Besides, I thought
`geerheads didn\'t grok style? :)

FTL? - what about Not As Fast As Light.  I\'m sure better games
can be built on that premise than some I\'ve seen.

  Considering that we know inferior J-drives can be built, and
that the Islands Clusters are no longer sequestered by TCS as
a naval testing range, why not design an alternative where FTL
doesn\'t reach them from outside and they can deal with the
implications of different Jump drives.  Heck, they tolerated
STL, they\'ll buy anything.

  Not my $0.02 worth - if I\'m having fun then it\'s free.

more of the points that explain why I like the \'fired from a cannon\' (canon?
:-)) explanation for jump drives in my game.

Read the following to yourself while dramatically waving your hands about
like a made professor. That should give you some idea of the Fast Talk skill
being used here...

One has to imagine that traveling along the the gun barrel is moving
\'towards\' the appropriate Jump dimension (rather than being a motion in
normal 3D space). The end of the barrel is the interface between normal and
J space and the J distance depends upon the projectile velocity. For an
accurate arrival distance, you need to carefully control this velocity,
hence the J grid warm up sequence is a bit like controlling the projectile\'s
acceleration down the barrel - a cock up at this point (too much or little
\'acceleration\' into J space) will cause you to end up in the wrong place.

Of course, my J explanation doesn\'t require one to always arrive within a
gravitational field - such fields can drastically affect the
ship/projectile\'s flight path within J space, but you exit J space when the
projectile effectively hits the \'ground\' (hand wave, call this the normal
space \'potential level\' or something). Whether or not this disrupts canon
depends upon which version of Traveller you regard as canon. In much the
same way, my thrusters work beyond gravity wells, etc. since they use an
interface to the Jump dimension instead. They\'re quite separate from the
grav devices (belts, rafts, etc.) used on planets, which can only act
against an existing gravity field).

FF&S personal weaponry designs are almost totally useless as they\'re ad hoc
and based on different principles for different kinds of guns (design an MD
gun and a Gauss gun and ponder the differences in design sequences). 3G3
makes Tl 8- guns with the right mass and general performance and teaches

Actually the electrons are both waves and particles until you measure them
with a macroscopical apparatus and then depending on what you measure they
will look like either a particle or a wave. There is not much discussion
among physicists on the philosophical ramifications of this because quantum
mechanics works so well no matter what paradoxical consequences it
generates.

Just my very off topic comment which has nothing to do with the versatility
of the alternative neuronpath thingy mentioned.

Thank you, Thank you Thank You.

For the life of me could not work out re-entry for these vehicals ( i
was thinking about contra-grav ,and matching orbit for re-entry [like
the interface carrier in Robert McBride Allen\'s Aliens and Allies
book)].

Actually , asuming that rubber excists (like Space 1889 does), space
suits are not that hard (they are overglorified deap diving suits). The
biggest problem is that as some one showed, wood is not a good space
material, as it warps easily in space. So in fact, the ships will have a
very short life. 

Life support is relitivly easy, propulsion is my biggest problem (I want
to avoid liftwood). The option I like is a Zeplin launcher. A Zeplin
lifts the ship into high astmosphere, then deploys the ship like Anti
satalight missile. I could use contragrav, but I want something that has
the feel of 1889.

I was also thinking of Steam +, and alagory of Fusion plus, where high
effiency steam engines are used (a bit like Harry Harrison\'s "A
Trans-Atlantic Tunnel Horrah!" atomic engines)

 They\'d do if starting with same speed but then they\'d start clumping up
real quick. In Beltstrike they had a newly shattered asteroid to move
around to create a movie style asteroid field but those disperse/clump
after a short time so you\'ll have to put your players there shortly after
the shattering event.

Hey, I believe that!!!!!
Not everything needs a creator, coincidence is a viable explanation 
for life on this planet. Just because we cannot, with current 
knowledge explain a given fact of existance, we do not need to say 
God did it! Just think about Thor or Zeus as explanation for Thunder

Iron and copper oxygen carriers: this gave me an idea.

Iron and copper are almost always found in two ionic states only: +2 
and +3 for Fe, +1 and +2 for copper.  (Yes, I\'ve made Fe(IV) 
compounds, it\'s not hard, but they\'re not over-stable.)  Haemoglobin

Let\'s invent an alien with a vanadium-based chemistry.  Vanadium will 
quite happily enter oxidation states 2, 3, 4 and 5.  What effect will 
this have?

When our alien is happy and relaxed, he operates a low metabolism, 
V++ to V+++ energy transfer, very much like ours.  Let\'s say it\'s a 
bit less efficient, actually... don\'t have the relevant electrode 
potentials to hand.  However, the alien can "supercharge" its blood 
to V++++ and even V+++++, allowing operation at a much higer 
metabolic rate _in extremis_, with faster movement and greater 
endurance/hits.  And the alien can "psych itself up" by boosting its 
metabolic rate before attempting something dangerous.  These 
creatures I see as intelligent, apparently quite placid beings who 
bleed purple and are not to be trifled with.

Let\'s say these creatures are from one of the waterworlds in the 
rimward part of Lanth/Spinward Marches - Cogri (2419) or Equus (2417)
are good candidates.  Ah, yes.  Equus.  These creatures are known as 
"seahorses", both from their resemblance to Terran 
seahorses and their own name for each other, Ekwa.  (Thus galanglic 
equine, adj. of or relating to i) terran horses, ii) generically, all 
riding beasts and iii) the Eqwa of Equus/Lanth.

Description: smallish human sized (50 kg), shallow-water based, with 
some ability to breathe oxygen from air as well as water.  (This is 
especially useful in "supercharging" their metabolism.)  They 
resemble a Terran seahorse in shape, with two short arms with 
residual webbing.  They operate as hunter-gatherers of the abundant 
marine life of Equus, with some fish-farming and herding.  Their 
culture is TL 0 or 1; their tools are of natural materials.  Due to 
the presence of large, deep-water predators, they prefer to feed 
above water in shallows.


I\'ve been meaning to think about the seahorses of Equus for a while, 
so thanks for triggering this idea, TML.

That only applies to non X-Ray lasers, an X-Ray laser can reach over
multiple hexes no problem, so either the TL stays below 13, or you push
X-Rays up the TL band. Also without Grav Focusing the lasers will be more
powerful inside their effective range, because they\'ll be more efficient.

If you look at the way the low level stuff in DNA works and the amount of
noninformational garbage there is in the DNA etc I\'d say if life was
designed by a being then he has to be an employee at Microsoft. In my
Traveller universe there definately IS a god (me) but my job as a GM is to
make my players believe there isn\'t and by counting the number of religious
believers in the real world(tm) I\'d say that if there is a God (which I
don\'t believe) then he shure does a crappy job as a GM.

Seriously, don\'t start a thread on wether life was an act of god or not.
There are mailing lists, newsgroups etc for this nonsense and we don\'t need
it here.

drawing pretty pictures on computers and that I could actually make more
money at it than I ever
could from sociology; and for once good sense prevailed.

I started playing traveller way back in \'78 (leans back on walking frame to
mutter something about
how these young \'uns don\'t know what it was like back then in the pioneering
days of RPG\'s, dang
nab it), shortly too be followed by a love affair with RuneQuest. I
continued playing Traveller
and RQ (with a slighly perverse attraction to CoC) up until the real world
rudely interfered in things
(marriage and two young children really eat into precious playing time) just
about the time when TNE
was released.

Apart from RPG\'s, I\'m also into Wargames (horse and musket era and ACW land
and age of sail
naval), history, sociology (well I\'m told that is curable), astronomy, being
a husband/father, various
noble trendy lefty causes (politically correct for the younger members of

all round enjoying myself without taking the world too seriously (insanity

Different switch. Uses two metal films with spongy plastic in between. As
separation between the films diminish the capacitance increases which is
what is measured. Waterproof cheap switches that can be used a long time.
The old metallic touch switches are on their way out in modern products.
You mostly see them on Amarican consumer electronics

	Something that I\'d be interested in seeing is a THUDDD revolving
around a non-canon ship class.  Something along the lines of the rescue
boat idea, or a heavily armed J3 "Frontier Trader", a Spofulamesque
ludicrous-armament-in-the smallest-possible-package wierdness, or something
else offbeat.  Fighters don\'t really turn my crank, although I think that
they ought to be done.

	If we\'re going to be redoing a topic I\'d plunk for the Far Trader
again...

My universe is more or less canon 3d Imperium but with considerably altered

	Possibly. If they have to be measured macroscopically to change, 
then the microtubes won\'t amplify heir wave-nature into transmittable 
macroscopic vibrations, and thus the whole system falls apart.

	I think that, at least the way I understood the "gravity lens" theory of jump, 
that the gravity well deistorts the way you aim your vessel (and probably screws 
around with the tunnel characteristics as well). Tha way, gravity well would 
definitely need to be AVOIDED, like they are now. Impure fuel just screws up the jump 
timing, yielding essentially the same results.

	Two reasons I can think of:
1. A lot of ship designs I have seen do not have enough feul to make two consecutive 
jumps without refueling. Meaning, if you misjump to the middle of nowhere, all you can 
do is point yourself at the nearest star, burn 1/4 of your manuever feul (or just kick 
in the ol\' thruster plates), program the computer to wake you up when you get close, 
go into low berth, and pray.
2. YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OF WHERE YOU END UP. While this may not matter as much for 
scouts, it would still take them 3 months or so to get back. For traders, this option 
is really only useful if the trader in question just wants a dramatic change of pace. 
For coerce, it would be so unpredictable as to be useless (Diamonds? What do we want 
with diamonds? They grow on trees here. Look! <pointing to oddly gliitering 
vegeation>).

	Also, I imagine that the jump drive/grid/whatever would be somewhat damaged by 
the misjump (gravity wells causing undue stress, impure feul clogging things up, 
etc.). As for jumping into stars, well, I suppose you could invoke the "no two objects 
may occupy the same point in space" rule.

Passive sensors don\'t have to wait for light propagation but they still
need integration time to make their signal louder than the noise.
When we discuss sensors on the list we tend to eat the cake and have it
too: We use astronomical sensordata to argue that we can just about detect
anything and the same with resolution. But if we are looking at a very
small part of the sky it will take forever to scan the entire sphere ore
even a hemisphere. If we only had a ballpark figure of needed exposure time
to detect "this" source at "that" range with "this" exposure covering
"this" angular area of the sky we could start calculating reasonable sensor
ranges. My system use very short sensor ranges until something is detected,
and then we can track it "forever".

Sounds fine to me, but then I\'m a fairly recent member, and haven\'t done any
designs.

BTW which design systems are considered legal? 
I presume that all entries have to conform to Melieu 0 standards.

Careful, or we\'ll bring up things like the Ontario government (any old one,

bring up _Roger & Me_ and its sequel _Pets or Meat_...

ObTrav:  Anyone ever get their players mixed up with separatists like the
Quebecois, or even the IRA?  There\'s gotta be a lot of good adventures there.

In an article on bows in an old SciAm (1984? 1988? -- features a painting
of a bow on the cover), they note that composite bow construction (horn,
wood, and sinew glued together) got so technical that one plan specified
using glue made from skin scrapings taken from the roof of the mouth of the
Volga river sturgeon.

This is a very cool article for the information on bows (short, long,
horse, crossbows, etc.) including ranges, punch power, etc.  It\'s also very
cool for the low-tech construction techniques -- from which you could, no
doubt, extrapolate all kinds of cool things!

Several possibilities

1- AD&D : Affect ... move to the next one

2- Chaosium : When a player do an outstanding success on a dice throw, give
him a point in the skill he succeed in!

3- Put points along the adventure plot. Caracters get them when they
discover of defeat something/someone. Risk : Looks too static, not very fun.

4- Cyberpunk/Vampire : Award point at a whole at then end of each stories.
Award point if the player has taken risks for the team, if he has done
quite good Role playing, if the team succed in their goad, if they\'ve
learned something... You can imagine all the topics you want. 

5- My system : I give points immediately when one player have done somthing
interessant for the general story or particulary coherent with his
character. The point allowance in totally subjective. I only check that I
give points to quite everyone. 

So 
1 is ... no forget it

2 is based only on dices, too bad. And the risk is that better skilled
players would get more points

3 is too static and not very fun. Central characters would get more points
and it pushes character to individualism.

4 is good, I\'ve used it for a very long time. Very simple, you don\'t have
to bother during the play or before. It\'s always the same table which is used.

5 is the system I use recently. The players like this system. BTW you can
control all the points you give. If a player is too weakly skilled, award
him some points for minor but interesting actions. For Example, I would
award point in a gun fight not to the character who was the most effective
but to the character who was intelligent and bring good fun to the game
scene. The main advantage is that the player are immedialy rewarded of
their efforts of improving their game quality. Their is no rules for this
system, just the GM common sense. Best I think

Well all my skills have a characteristic linked to it Pilot(INT),
Knife(DEX) etc and all skill improvements are tasks based on the
controlling characteristic, getting harder as skill levels increase. After
each play session me and my players go through what skills they primarily
used durng the session, then they can choose which single one they will try
to improve by rolling a characteristics task. If they fail no xps are
earned etc but statistically if they use a skill a lot and keep rolling
they\'ll end up with a higher skill.

Main points are: no xps to keep track of, raising skill levels gets harder
as the levels increase and the "maximum" skill level attainable is highly
dependant on the controlling characteristic. My tasksystem uses skill ONLY
so the characteristics determine the ease in improving skills.

 The electrons will keep their wavelike qualities in the system until You
measure them by some macroscopic method. Wether they\'ll measure as wavelike
or particlelike depends on in what way You measure them and should be of no
significance as to how the system works. This collapsing of wavefunctions
is something pretty hard to understand as it doesn\'t take place unless you
measure something and some even argue that it has to be You and not me that
does it.

There are big problems in the current philosophical interpretation of
quantum mechanics (Copenhagen interpretation) as it leads to all sorts of
paradoxes but most physicists don\'t care because quantum mechanics works
nevertheless.
I could go into this a bit deeper but I think it is off topic.

	All of these posts about 1889 and M:1965 are bringing back memories of my 
very first Traveller campaign. While it wasn\'t an alternate history at the 
time...

	Way back in 1986 or so, I was just starting to look beyond D&D for my RPG 
fix, and I had just bought good \'ole Starter Traveller, and I was VERY 
excited by it. Of course, Starter Traveller had absolutely no background 
material in it, beyond a couple of oblique references to an Imperium. So, 
at a sleep-over a couple of weeks later (hey, I was 11 or 12 at the time), 
my friend and I quickly started rolling up UPPs for for the People\'s 
Democratic Republic or Earth, a small group of 20 worlds or so, where the 
commies had won the cold war, and the players were going to be some kind of 
rebels fighting for peace, order and good government for earth (hey, I\'m 
Canadian).

	As well, right next to the PRE was the Sword Worlds, since Starter 
Traveller came with two adventures, Shadows, and Mission on Mithril (which 
is set in the Sword Worlds).

	Alas, I don\'t think that setting lasted beyond rolling up the planets, and 
setting a free trader loose among the planets for a couple of test runs, 
all done that night. Shortly after I bought Supplement 3, the Spinward 
Marches, and the rest was history. And of course now that I\'m feeling 
nostalgic, I can\'t even find a single trace of that work.

years as a Truck Driver, Forklift Operator, S and R Clerk, Quality Assurance
Man, Courier, and a warehouse  supervisor. You need it shipped, packed,
moved, transported, delivered, repacked, shrink wrapped, written up (In a

I don\'t even charge extra for additional paperwork and bullying the

     It only took me those twelve years to figure out that I could make a lot
more money solving puzzels and not be treated like a steaming pile of cow
waste. Thus I am in my current situation; living with the girlfriend,
ocassionally being allowed to make love, playing RPGs, Traveller, Call of

happily die if I could find a good game of Kingmaker with more then two
adversaries. 
     Tried Live-Action role playing - it\'s ok but too much work. Love the
cold winter of Wisconsin, my current home.

 Other Hobbies: History, English, from Roman conquering (Claudius Rules) to
the War of the Roses (Richard the Third - wasn\'t he the guy that bombed
Cambodia? Wups wrong Richard). Reading Science Fiction, Horror and Detective
novels. Watching foreign films with subtitles (I hate dubbing). Thwapping the
cat and getting bit in return.

After I finished my conscripted duty in the Royal Norwegian navy I was
introduced to RPGs by a friend. A Swedish system called Mutant. I
liked it and decided to buy my own game, but I wanted something more
"realistic" FS RPG. The choise fell on MT which was fairly new in
1987. And I have never looked back since. I have also meddled with
other games as Paranoia, Torg, Albedo and the (A)D&D stuff. Never
owned the latter.

Other interests are Harpoon (For those of you who got Harpoon Naval
Review 1994 may have seen that I played in the Gulf of Sitra scenario
at GenCon 1992.), biking, and computers.

Well, if I could describe it, I certainly wouldn\'t be wasting my time
posting to the TML -- I\'d be shopping for a mansion up in the Hollywood
Hills. :)  But I think the next thing with a similar impact is going to be
nanofabrication technology -- not necessarily in the Drexler sense (little
teeny robots crawling around building things), but rather the general
ability to produce components \'machined\' on the atomic scale in industrial
quantities.  This will have immediate and profound effects on several
other technologies, most notably chip production and structural materials
synthesis.  Among other things, the results will be computers a couple of
orders of magnitude \'denser\' (processing capacity per unit mass or power)
than present models, and ultralight/strong/tough materials for vehicles,
buildings, and other applications.

That certainly does far less harm to the background, of course.  It also
helps solve the eternal "how to roleplay jump transit time" problem...in
the absence of cantankerous passengers, hijacking attempts, or whatnot,
it\'s far too easy to fall into the habit of glossing over the weeks of
jump, which in turn does a disservice to the \'realism\' (so to speak) of
the game. 

There is an interesting side effect, though.  Crews of ships which jump
frequently (the trader being a classic example) end up spending roughly
half their time in jumpspace.  If you collapse subjective time in jump to
zero, merchants end up aging half as fast as the general population.  The
ships themselves would age half as fast, too, reducing maintenance
requirements.  One could imagine circumstances in which jump would be used
like a weak version of Vinge\'s \'bobble\' technology, with ships doing a
series of in-place jumps with rapid refueling in between to skip rapidly
into the future.

Sounds OK by me.  Teen pregnancy relates to family structure, which certainly
affects a science fiction setting.  So does a culture\'s attitudes towards

Brilliant Lances, hands down.  Gritty, realistic, and fast-playing.  (That
is, fast-playing after you\'ve filled out the control panels.  I did that one
day while in bed with the flu, and after that even pickup games are a snap.)

After that I\'d place Battle Rider, followed by Mayday.

Never liked High Guard as a combat system - seemed too much like "Wooden
Ships, Iron Men" in space.

MegaTraveller was OK, but too much complication for not enough realism.

Depends on what you\'re measuring.  Large-scale industrial production is
lacking, true, as are native-designed computers.  Medical technology is
considerably better than TL0/1, though.

Traveller tech levels really should be specified in catagories (as in World
Builders Handbook), rather than as a single digit.  Possibly even
differentiated by region.  As well, alternative technologies should be used. 
None of which invalidates the basic code given in a UWP, just expands it.

In MegaTraveller, the stated tech levels represented achievement tech levels:
the highest technology available on that world.  It may be imported, and
common tech might well be several levels below.

Thus, Earth has a tech level of 8.  Some fields are at level 9, others
aren\'t.  The majority of the population lives at a lower tech level, and even
in the higher-tech countries the latest technology is not evenly distributed.

In MT/TNE, fighters are very useful against unarmoured, lightly armed ships
such as merchants, supply ships, etc.  In my Imperium, fighters are used much
like gunboats. They are stationed in orbit around worlds and bases; their
task is to investigate/escort incoming ships. Against a destroyer they are
nearly useless, but vessels like the Gazelle Close Escort (or your average
merchant) can be damaged/eliminated quite easily.

In essence, then, the job of a fighter pilot is to fly out there and
determine if more force is needed. 


Players in command of a naval squadron will not have to worry about fighters.
Players smuggling in a Far Trader will.

The best system (for combining \'realism\' and speed) that I\'ve seen yet is the
one in The Babylon Project.

Hit effects are determined by hit location and weapon type, with immediate
effects being limited to (a) am I still standing, (b) can I still use that
location, and (c) am I bleeding enough to require immediate first aid?  After
the combat is over there\'s some simple procedures that determine the specific
damage, medical attention required, and recovery times. 

This system _is_ fairly deadly, just like combat in B5, but it is actually
faster and easier than TNE and T4.  (Basing easier on being able to use it
after reading the rules once.)  I haven\'t rated it wrt MT and CT, because
those systems are \'second nature\' to me now.

There was an article in Scientific American a while back that looked at how
difficult it was for a researcher to get published in the mainstream
scientific journals if he/she wasn\'t from an industrialized country. 
Included examples where papers were rejected when sent from a place like
Brazil, then the same paper was accepted when it came from America.

The authors concluded that, statistically, the address of a researcher made a
difference as to whether or not their paper was accepted.

My father, who recently retired from the biomed field, remarked that a lot of
the "new discoveries" in medicine in the last decade have been the result of
researchers interviewing locals in Third World countries, recording their
home-grown cures, and investigating them.  Naturally, the researcher gets the
credit for this discovery, even if they can\'t explain why it works!  (Rather
like how the famous explorers "discovered" vast parts of America and Africa:
write down what the locals tell you, then publish it under your name ignoring
your guides.)

To my mind the 1 week idea is good. It allows for a lag in communications
that adds to the overall feel of the game universe, imho. I like the lag
time as it stands, but am open to suggestions on how it could be changed,
and how these changes would alter the game universe.

Getting an asteroid belt with the kind of densities seen in Empire, is
possible on short term scales. It was mentioned earlier that a field with 
higher density could be the result of a larger body that had just broken up.
Over time, because of collisions within the belt, the field would tend to 
evenly distribute itself over a toroidal envelope centered on the orbit of 
the original body. Objects would only leave this region if pushed by some 
external force. Because the chaotic dynamics of the many body problem, two 
near by asteroids would tend to travel very different paths, and therefore
would not remain close.

I can\'t remember the the length of time since Grandfather\'s war, but I\'d
guess that any worlds demolished then would have had time to redistribute 
themselves along their original orbit. 

Even a field placed out in open space would eventually collapse in on itself 
unless the pieces were quite far apart.

You can\'t have a (relatively) stable belt with a density much higher than
Sol\'s.  Squeeze objects closer together, and both the collision and mutual
perturbation rates go *way* up; soon, the belt density is back down again
through material being ejected, and the mean object size is reduced
through collision shattering.

Two nearby asteroids will follow slightly different orbits.  If they\'re
close enough, they will mutually perturb one another, complicating
matters.

Several people have mentioned that ring systems (e.g., Saturn\'s) are much
denser than the asteroid belt.  This is true.  However:

- - Saturns\'s rings are *not* stable in their current configuration.
  They are losing mass and broadening over a geologically short time
  scale.  Within a few hundred million years, they\'ll be a pale ghost
  of what we see now.

- - Mean object size in the jovian planets\' ring systems is on the order of
  a centimeter or so.  This relatively fine grain size helps keep the
  rings a bit more stable than \'chunkier\' systems would be at the same
  mass density.

One other thing to mention is that (as others have noted) asteroids do
appear to have smaller asteroid \'satellites\' at times; Galileo spotted a
small body (now named \'Dactyl\') orbitting Ida as it passed the latter.
New models indicate that such satellites might be fairly common in the
main belt.  So on a fair number of asteroids, there would be one or two
hunks of rock in visual range.

Another point worthy of attention is that some earth-crossing asteroids
appear to be several distinct bodies in contact with one another, like a
pile of boulders, bound by self-gravitation.  Such might result from
low-energy impacts, as when two asteroids on nearly identical orbits
collide.  Debate continues on how many asteroids are boulder/gravel piles
bound by self-gravity, and how many are single solid objects.

>>>....the jump lag time is so crucial to the history of Traveller, no

I agree but I did it anyway. 

In my universe, I have the "proportional" jump drive. A ship may complete a
jump of lesser value than it\'s drive rating in a proportional amount of time.
For example, a ship with a jump2 drive can perform a 1 parsec jump in only
half a week. To compensate for this, more fuel is consumed. Here\'s how it
breaks down for a jump2 ship:

Distance        Time           Fuel Consumed
2 parsecs      1 week       Whole tank
1 parsec        1 week        1/2 tank
1 parsec        1/2 week     Whole tank

It DOES affect communication on the local level. YES I have altered the
timeline to account for this. I DO NOT recommend it, unless you don\'t have to
work for a few months and really have the urge to do so.

However, it does NOT affect long range communication. Jump 6 is still the MAX
jump drive (at TL15: Maximum Imperial) available. It still takes a long time
for info to get from Capital to Deneb or Regina or Earth or wherever you\'re
at.

Ships are expensive! Besides corporations, governments with a large tax base,
and the extremely wealthy, who can afford a ship, much less one with a souped
up jump drive. Who\'s going to bankroll Joe Merchant\'s startup company? Banks
are going to be reluctant to due to the inherent dangers of space travel and
the possibility that Joe Merchant is going to run off and not pay anything
more than the down payment. (Call in the Repo Men)

From a merchant\'s standpoint, what should he get? A quicker ship with less
cargo space (lost due to fuel & engine space requirements) or the slower ship
with more room for cargo. In my setup, the quicker ship has higher operating
expenses due to higher fuel consumption and a higher investment cost due to
 the engines. It\'s up to the individual merchant to figure out the economics.

I don\'t expect anyone here to actually be swayed into even seeing my point. I
just wanted to present it. Guess I\'m a bit of a masochist, but that\'s another
thread. ; )

astonishing advances they\'re making in solar cells...there are
experimental cells that are something like 80% efficient (yes EIGHTY!)at
converting light to electricity. They have some serious problems to
overcome, since the things are readily poisoned by 02, but man o man could
that make clean energy realllllly cheap in the long run. 

	Coupled with the advances they\'re making in polymer batteries,
which are very close to commercial use, cheap, light, powerful electronic
devices could become far more ubitiquous than today.

Sounds like a hole to me.  Perhaps you never read the *original* post
that formed this exchange of ideas?

"The \'heat sink\' dimension requires heat input to act as a barrier
between it and us?"  What is this supposed to mean?  What happens when
too little heat is dumped?  A jump field that collapses while in jump
is catastrophic (read my description above).  A "heat field" collapse
would be equally catastrophic due to the different physics involved
(extrapolated from the only Traveller data I have regarding isolating
different dimensions).

Nowhere in Traveller canon does it state that jump field energy is
being "dumped" *into jumpspace* to prevent its incursion.  Since the
poster is a Traveller player and did not submit any new facts about
his theory (outside of the Traveller universe), I presumed we were
both using Traveller canon.

Yet he/you is allowed to change or bring forth "facts" to support his
claim (like your reply above)?  How can I play his game if he\'s the
only one that knows the rules?

The original post for a dimensional heat sink was triggered by
someone\'s need for true IR masking in outer space.  Ignoring a second
dimension or method that could be used to draw heat out of would mean
that the original poster just invented the "perpetual motion machine"
and broke several conservational laws.  So much for "internal
coherence".

Ow.  I detect angst.  Sure would be nice if I had something else to go
on, though.

The original poster asked anyone if they could come up with a theory
(that wasn\'t totally far-fetched and based on the Traveller universe)
to disprove his proposed existence of a dimension suitable for use as
a heat sink for purposes of IR masking (the word "hole" was mentioned
at one point).  That\'s it.  If I am limited to minuscule information
such as this, I stand about the same chance disproving his proposal as
I would have disproving that the world was "square".

I therefore assumed that this wasn\'t some sort of formal challenge and
came up with the casual reply you see at the top.  Since my reply is
nearly a week old by now and I haven\'t seen a reply from the original
poster, I suspect that my submission was enough to satisfy him.

The thing is, in combat, most rounds are fired to make the other side
keep down, not at an actual person. 

Check the lethality of street shootings. Much closer to the "combat"
found in many games. That is, you are practically on top of the enemy,
and if you have any skill you won\'t miss. 

It\'s still possible to not hurt the target, but that\'s more dependent
on the weapon used. A .25 automatic, for example, has been known to be
stopped by a heavy sweater!

It\'s a vector. Consider. I heave a 1000 kg block off the rear end of a
1000 kg spacecraft at 1 m/s. In the frame we started in, the initial
state has a KE of 0. So does the final state. The ship has a KE of +500
joules. The block has a KE of -500 joules. Total: zero.

If I wanted to do the trig, I could send *3* equal masses off at mutual
120 angles, and still get a total of zero. But I\'d have to use complex
numbers for the KE of two of them.

But the *total* KE of ship plus star is always *constant*. You only
have to make the energy expended equal KE gained in the frame of the
ship!

A high energy cosmic ray will go right through you doing very little
damage. Put a nice thick metal wall in the way and it\'ll hit a nucleus
creating *thousands* of secondaries, all of which are low power enough
to be absorbed by your body, doing *lots* of damage.

There is actually a point where if you can\'t add a *lot* more
shielding, you are better off with *no* shielding.

Solar flares are in the lower energy spectrum so those you do need
shielding from. Luckily LH2 is *great* at stopping protons. 

We really need more data about likely flare strengths at various
ranges. Could one of the astronomers on the list give us info about the
likely frequency and strength of flares on various types of stars? 

Then we\'ll need to figure out the shielding needed and how much good
it\'ll do against weapons.

Not a biologist, just a person who remembers trivia...

Selecting sex of human offspring turns out to be doable at an
*incredibly* low tech level. All you need to do is change the pH of the
vagina and cervix. Not even by that much. A change one way stops the
male sperm and slows down the female ones. A change the other way
doesn\'t stop the female ones but greatly slows them down. (I may have
this backwards, but you get the essential idea). 

This is actually causing problems in the real world right now as it
allows people in places like China and India to have sons instead of
daughters. And that\'s gonna be a *real* problem when those sons get
older. Yes, infanticide in the poorer classes is used too, but the
somewhat educated classes know about the trick and use it!

So the humans can easily skew the ratio quite a bit merely with
douches, or with dietary supplements of some sort.

As a post the other day pointed out, all that the size of your
powerplant does is tell you *how long* it takes to reach a given
velocity.

The formula derived was v=sqrt(2Pt/M), where v is velocity (m/s), P is
power (joules), t is time (s), and M is mass of ship (kg).

V^2=2Pt/M
MV^2=2Pt
MV^2/2P=t

So: 

1e5=100,000=m (100 tons)
1e5=100,000=v (100 km/s)
1e8=100,000,000=p (100 MW)

t=1e5*(1e5)^2/(2*1e8)
t=1e5*1e10/2e8
t=1e15/2e8
t=1e7/2
t=5e6

Not good, as that\'s 58 *days*. On the other hand, jump works ok for the
long trips. :-) 
With 6 GW, it takes less than a day.

If someone will give me the integral of v=sqrt(2Pt/M), then we\'ll have
a formula for the distance traveled as a function of time. If it\'s low
enough for a typical 100 diameter trip, then I think this is a great
solution. :-)

For what it is worth, I *think* the formula is d=sqrt(4PT^6/M)

d=sqrt(4PT^6/M)
d^2=4PT^6/M
Md^2=4PT^6
Md^2/4P=T^6

100 dia= 1,120,000 km
1.12e9 = distance
1e5=100,000=m (100 tons)
1e8=100,000,000=p (100 MW)

1e5*(1.12e9)^2/(4*1e8)=t^6
1e5*1.2544e18/4e8=t^6
1.2544e23/4e8=t^6
1.2544e15/4=t^6
3.136e14=t^6
t=~261

Hmmm, that *can\'t* be right. Either that, or the starting acceleration
will kill you...

You will need good optics and a lot of patience to detect bodies out in
the Kuiper belt, much less the Oort cloud. Their IR signature will be
way down, and even if they reflect enough light, it\'ll take a while to
determine that they aren\'t a star! 

Best bet is to unlimber the big scope (say half meter or more), and
take a lot of pictures, wait, and take another set. Have the computer
check to see what light sources have moved.

Well, a lot depends on how you are scanning. For example, it ought to
be possible to modify a det-laser warhead to generate a *microwave*
pulse. Do that and you just wait for the echoes. Anything that takes
more than an hour is likely too far away to help you anyway (remember,
Pluto is 5 light hours away from the Sun).

The "det radar" bit is borrowed from a proposal that Arthur C. Clarke
borrowed for a couple of his stories. They used a gigaton pulse to get
data on everything within a light day or so of the system. I figure a
smaller version should be good for 30 light minutes or so, and make one
hell of a "distress flare". 

If det lasers are allowed, then a few "adapters" for the warheads ought
to be standard equipment.

Depending on how close and how big, the answer could be "it takes a day
or two" or "it\'s freaking obvious". Gimmee some data on how size(mass)
and distance are related in your misjump theory, and I\'ll give you a
better answer.

Just dropping a few minor news items into the local news should at
least start them thinking. Have some "psi-bashing" incidents in the
news, that sort of thing. And have some *very* anti-psi jokes. About on
the level of the one about the two rednecks out hunting when one gets
bitten by a snake while taking a leak....

That sort of thing can set up the right attitude or at least have it in
the background so that when they get nailed they can look back and
realize that they should have expected it.

Whoa! Those last two are a matter of *health*. As in it reduces the
chances of things spreading in crowded barracks or troop ships. So that
is something that they *will* have to teach, just like teaching the
backwoods types about using the \'fresher instead of the bushes around
the barracks.

I suspect that when dealing with cultures as diverse as those found in
the Imperium, they will have rules about not putting folks from *this*
culture in with folks from *that* culture.

I also suspect that they\'ll go back to the idea of units being
generally homogenous with respect to the culture they are recruited
from. You\'ll tend to stay with the same "unit" (say regiment or larger
unit) for your whole career. You\'ll just swap around inside it as you
pick up skills and rank. 

This has advantages in that it\'s easy to grab a unit to put down an
"uprising" and *know* that they won\'t be sympathetic to the wrong side.
And it makes cuylture and tech level clashes less of a problem. 

There are likely also rules about which cultures work well together. So
if you are from a "new" culture, they can check for similar cultures
and assign you a unit based on that. If they get enough from your
world, you may get shifted together into the same sub-unit, just to
make it easier to handle you.

Heck, the various minor human races likely have developed *real*
differences in things like tolerance for heat/cold/humidity, and
sensitivity to or need for certain types of food or chemicals. 

If folks from XYZ are generally allergic to cheese, then it\'s a lot
better to group them in the same unit (lactose intolerance is just
*one* example of the sort of thing that can occur over a lot less than
300,000 years!). 

And you definitely *don\'t* want to mix troops from a hot, dry "desert"
world with ones from a cool, wet world. They won\'t be able to sleep in
each others barracks due to temp and humidity problems. They may be
acutely uncomfortable just passing thru each other\'s bunkrooms in a
troop ship!

Remember, the Theban "Sacred Bands" were all one sex, and lovers on top
of that. If anything, it made them *better* fighters because of the
effect on morale. You don\'t break and run with your lover standing next
to you. Not unless things are *really* bad.

It\'s against code to use the body to *complete* the circuit. What you
likely have are capacitance operated switches. They rely on the idea
that placing a dieletric material near a conductor changes the
capacitance of the conductor. This is how those elevator buttons that
don\'t seem to move, but do light up, work.

Vampire, yes, as he\'s a fluid filled bag surrounded by a barely
conductive shell of skin. Cat, not likely, as the *size* matters.

As a worst case, you\'d need a metal probe attached to something like a
wrist grounding strap to opewrate them. I proved to a friend that the
elevator switches *didn\'t* work off of body heat by touching them with
my old fountain pen. I held the plastic end and touched with the metal
cap. The fluid inside made it work.

The part that touches doesn\'t necessarily need to be conductive. But
you need a large amount of conductive fluid in the body and a *small*
gap between it and the sensor. That\'s why socks didn\'t work.

BTW, if you touch this metal plate and feel a "buzz" or "vibration",
and it has a 2-prong plug, unplug it and plug it back in with the
prongs swapped.  The vibration means that the "ground" side of the
circuitry is connected to the *hot* side of the outlet. That\'s a damn
good way to get electrocuted!

It\'s possible, but not likely. Thick skinned races might have trouble.
Low mass races (Droyne?) will *really* have trouble as the amount of
material makes a difference.

Capacitacance sensors are used as security in some military
applications. You definitely "tune" those to the approximate mass of
the animal you are looking for.

Take a wooden yardstick, a gallon jug, and some insulated wire (about 6
feet). Strip the insulation off the ends of the wire. tape one end to
the end of the yardstick, and hold the other end of the yardstick. Lay
the wire out along the floor in a straight line away from the lamp but
at right angles to the yardstick.
            +----lamp
            |
            v
            * ---- wire
            |
            | yardstick.

Hold the unwired end of the yardstick touch the wire on the other end
to the touch plate. It shouldn\'t light up. If itdoe, try shortebing the
wire and making sure it isn\'t near any pipes or the like.

Next move over to where you can touch the free end of the wire and use
the yardstick to touch the other end to the touchplate. The lamp should
light. 

Now drop the end of the wire into the empty jug, and move back towards
your original position. Touching the wired end of the stick to the lamp
shouldn\'t turn it on. But if you add water to the jug, it will. If it\'s
a plastic jug, and you wrap the stripped wire closely around the neck
(where there is water in it) it\'ll likely *still* be able to trigger
the lamp.

Get the idea? It\'s a lot of conductive material *seperated* from the
touch plate by a *thin* non-conductor.

Not really. Your fingernails are effectively chitin. you can\'t feel
them, just the pressure they exert on the tissues around them.

Nope. Touch is actually *several* different senses that we lump
together. Off the top of my head there are sensors for heat, cold,
pressure, "sharpness", etc.

Pressure works by compression of tissues. "sharpness" works by noting
that the compression is very localized (and if you have a friend
experiment with a pin, you\'ll find areas where you *cannot* feel the
tip of the pin!). Heat and cold are likely measuring the "flow" of heat
(ie comparing the effect on surface strands and deeper ones).

We have a *lot* more than five senses. I seem to recall a figure
somewhere around 13 to 15?

Reality check time.

If the "sand" is thick enough to stop or at least cut down laser
damage, any missile flying through it is *toast*. Picture turning a
sand blasting unit on the missile. Only the sand is moving at tens to
hundred of km/sec relative to the missile.

The "pitting" is going to be centimeters deep. maybe even decimeters...

One of the *classics* of SF, the Lensman series, is mostly about

societies that do.

Nope. It takes multicellular life to *need* that sort of oxygen
carrier. Single celled life just uses osmosis across the cell membrane.

And you\'ve almost certainly *eaten* life forms with copper based blood.

*Most* terrestrial life uses hemoglobin. Most molluscs and arthropods
use hemocyanin. That\'s copper based, and bright blue when oxygenated,
clear when it isn\'t. So a hemocyanin based critter would bleed blue
from arteries, sort of cloudy clear/milky from veins.

There\'s another iron-based respiratory pigment called hemerythin(sp).
It varies between brick red and pink. It is of interest because it is
unaffected by several gases that bond irrevocably to hemoglobin, such
as cyanide. So it might be found commonly on world with a cyanide or
similar taint in the atmosphere.

It\'s been years since I researched this (for anarticle for JTAS that I
never got around to writing), but I seem to recall another copper based
pigment, and a nickel based one. The prize is a species of sea slug
that uses hemo-vanadin, an apple green *vanadium* compound.

Not nearly enough time for that to happen to humans. And it\'d require

Neither. In an asteroid belt, you\'ll need instruments to see other
asteroids. They\'ll be hundreds if not *thousands of miles apart. Work
it out. There are maybe a few thousand asteroids bigger than a mile.
Now figure out the area of the belt (an annulus between the inner and
outer radii of the orbits). Divide the area of the annulus by the
number of asteroids. They\'ll be a *long* ways apart.

Heck, the belt is about 2.4 AU typical orbital radius. That\'s a
circumference of 15 AU. or about 2250 *million* km. Assume all
asteroids have that orbital radius and that there are 100,000
asteroids. That means that they average 22,500 km apart. That\'s a
*long* ways. And getting 100,000 bodies of say 100 meters or large is
gonna be one *dense* belt (work out the total mass and compare it to
the mass of a small planet)

The relative positions aren\'t fixed because different orbital radii
mean different orbital periods. So unless they are close enough to
orbit each other, asteroids that are "close" right now will be a good
chunk of the orbital circumference away in a year or so.

So asteroid belts are *nothing* like any movie, and very few books get
it right.

While most of them *are* reprehensible types, some aren\'t so easy to
dismiss. Why is an 18 year old capable of consenting to a sexual
relationship, but not a 17 year old? At *that* level, I *do* think we
need to take a look at our laws. An adult and a six year old is rather
different. <duh!>

Frankly, I hope that at some point we will find an *objective* means of
measuring maturity. Only thing is, I bet about 10-25% of the current
"adult" population would flunk the test.

Such a test would be useful in the Imperium, what with all the
different "races" of humaniti. But it could lead to trouble too.

Once we get the ability to scan genetic codes easily, it *should* be a
matter of whether or not your genes are likely to cause problems for
offspring rather than how "closely" related you are. 

And that brings up the matter of "at what point do you tell people that
they aren\'t allowed to have children with each other because of
possible genetic abnormalities"? Because that\'s *all* the anti-incest
rules amount to as far as any non-religious basis goes.

Something else. There are two main ways to do it. 

1. have a flat screen with IR emitters and detectors arond the edges.
   That gives a "row,colum" for the touch. If you can trigger the
   screen without applying any pressure, that\'s what they are using.

2. transparent membrane keyboard built onto the face of the screen. You
   have a layer of plastic, a layer of very thin wires (or strips of
   conductive film) running horizontally on the surface. Next you have
   a layer of plastic with holes punched out where they want you to
   touch.
                 +--+--+--+--+
                 |  |  |  |  |
                 +--+--+--+--+
                 |  |  |  |  |
                 +--+--+--+--+
   Then another layer of plastic with wires or strips, only this time
   they are running vertically, and are on the side facing the other
   sheet of plastic. Sandwich this together and put it on the screen,
   and if you press in on the places over the "holes" in the middle
   sheet (most of the screen :-) you make a contact. That gives row and
   column info and the computer takes that info and does whatever it
   was programmed to do.  The programmer just has to make sure that the
   display is lined up with the "buttons".

Can you tell that one of the other folks in my department had to design
a touch screen system? :-)

Slizard is also a loss as he took the pump technology that he and

ideal coolant pump for a reactor (the liquid sodium pumps at Hanford
are based on it).

Nope. They *also* had a version of the V-1 (the original "cruise
missile", btw) that was launched from *subs*. And they\'d always be
interested in better fighters. 

And looking ahead, the Navy *knows* it\'s the only service with
experience at keeping critical gear going for weeks and months at a
time without outside help. They really *are* best suited for longterm
space missions.

True. The area-51 stuff would get Heinlein. And I bet he and Einstein
would be great at coming up with oddball ways of testing stuff to see
what it did (given what\'s known of Einstein as a "technical" person,
and Heinlein\'s open-minded approach to new ideas)

The Navy would be interested in antipodal "skip-planes" as *cargo*
carriers. They tend to have more of a need to get urgent personnel or
cargo to oddball spots fast. The Army already has tons of people and
supplies at bases or tries to ship half the base. But if a ship needs a
lefthanded frammis, it tends to need it *now*.

And I bet that the submarine service will have its fingers in the pie
as they are likely to be the best experts on closed cycle life support
when real space *ships* get going.

True... but what with low berths, anagathics, and slow drug (or is it fast

At least in CT -- the only rules set I\'m familiar with -- shipboard L/S is
a pretty small part of the operating expense, except on passenger liners,
perhaps.  I don\'t see that reducing shipboard jump time can really "wreck"
canon in this regard.

As far as the time machine thing goes:  misjump.  Especially if they\'re
trying to hide and hugging a gas giant.  Besides, between each jump, "the
man" would have a full week to call for reinforcements, polish his lasers\'
lenses, and get ready to intercept you again... whereas you\'d have less (or
no) time to prepare.

I like the "instantaneous subjective duration" option on its own grounds,
but it\'s not very appealing in terms of playability... though like Craig
Berry points out in another message, the effects on the interstellar \'jet
set\' over the years would be interesting.

The "jump dimension-determined duration" could be more fun.  Heck, if you
really wanted to put a twist in the canon, you could say the shipboard time
in jump is one week *per jump number*.  That wouldn\'t affect the speed of
communication and movement in the Imperium, but would sure change *how*
people travel.  X-Boat crews, for one thing, would be strange people...

I always thought so too, but I think so less and less now.  T4 pushes the
Imperium much more than CT did (I never played the intervening versions).
I\'ll admit that I\'m a bit uncomfortable with Marc pushing things like
"every adventure begins and ends at a starport", which has just a whiff of
Gygax-like "this is the RIGHT way to play my game" about it.  And, as
people here have said, changing the 1-week jump rule changes many of the
assumptions about the structure of Traveller society.

A few others have outlined some of the more basic changes, having to do
with the flow of information and physical control of distant systems.  The
1-week lag does make for a more colonial-Imperial society, which _is_ cool,
but which is also somewhat limiting in scope; the game is less generic for
this basic rule.

Hah, I wrote a paper on this. There are asteroid families. These are
believed to come from the destruction of a bigger asteroid.  These
families don\'t orbit each other, they tend be near each other in the
sky and to have similiar orbits.  
Picture if the Earth blew up, after the pieces flew apart, the center
of the cloud of debris would still orbit around the sun in a year, and
would be close to the current path of the earth.   

Some people thought that Asteroids would actually orbit each other, but
after much searching, we have only found one binary asteroid (Ida and
Dactyl)  Dactyl is only 1km, while Ida is about 55km.  The early though
was looking for asteroids of the same size oribiting each other.  It
might be interesting to put in a binary asteroid in an asteroid belt
scenario.  It would one of the few times you would actually see two
asteroids at the same time.  

Some of the asteroids go backwards, these are called retrograde orbits
, but they are a minority.  They probably got that way after a
collision with other asteroids.  

Oh, I guess I\'ll join the Traveller who am I thing.  
I am a 5th year grad student working on my PhD in Astronomy at Georgia

The Forlorn: History

The Forlorn are a minor human race of unknown origin.  Commonly called
Gypsies, a term they dislike, the Forlorn (the Galanglic translation of
their word to describe themselves) are the only known zero-gee adapted
humans. 

The Forlorn, as near as can be told, seem to have originated somewhere in
the area of space trailing the Imperium (Milieu 0), possibly somewhere in
the Fornast sector, possibly more distant than that. Their planetary
culture apparently reached about TL 8 before some great calamity occurred
on their homeworld. The Forlorn themselves have only fragmentary knowledge
of that time, and no remaining records; much of their history has been
passed down in an oral tradition, this time is known only to them as \'The
Destruction\'. 

Apparently they had some warning of the calamity, because they undertook a
desperate task: to save as much of their people, culture and history as
possible. 

A monstrous building effort took place on their home world, which
according to their oral tradition sapped all of it\'s resources. 

Hundreds of large sub-light ships were built, several millions of people
were placed on board for a journey that was supposed to only last,
perhaps, ten years, to nearby systems that their scientists thought
contained planets that would sustain them. 

At this point what happened is unclear. Tradition holds that whatever the
calamity was, reached out and overtook their ships, as well, before they
were completely out of the system. Apparently great damage was done to all
of the ships, many were utterly destroyed, most lost some functions. The
great fleet was scattered, as well. 

Through truly heroic effort, some twenty seven of the ships were brought
back together. All were damaged, many had hundreds of dead and wounded,
with failing life support systems, failing power generation, failing
control systems. 

Fortunately the people in the 27 had access to a large supply of material
and machinery destined for use on the now-unreachable target systems. By
cannibalizing their future, they managed to bind the 27 into a loose
association of structures, linked by tenuous threads, but linked
nonetheless. 

After 1500 years, they had traveled unimaginable distances, and had come
to know themselves as the Forlorn, the lost ones, as they passed star
after star, never having the delta vee their feeble propulsion system
could muster to stop at the ones their instruments indicated had habitable
planets, never finding one they could stop at that had anything but baked
vacuum rocks and vast, cold gas giants. 

As the centuries passed they became accustomed to their low gee world,
becoming masters at recycling, refashioning ships again and again,
stealing matter from the cold empty space, atom by atom, with huge
magnetic nets, that fueled their power systems, ran their lights, kept
their precious plants alive, kept them alive. 

They changed, physically, as well. Their ancestors had all been chosen for
their suitability of working in space, and the harsh first 500 years
ruthlessly weeded out all but the fittest. They slowly became slender,
lithe, conservative of air, and movement. The 27 could only manage 0.25
gravities in the parts that were able to spin for weight. Most of the
living spaces were permanently weightless. 

The web that bound the 27 became the culture that bound the Forlorn.
Cooperation was essential in all things, and each individual had a grave
responsibility to all, if they were to survive. Yet grim surroundings did
not mean grim people. They had access to a number of plant dyes to color
their world, and once the dreadful first few centuries passed, and they
learned to manage their world better, they were able to expand, have
families, start to live again. They had to, else succumb to the gnawing
despair that had robbed so many in the early years of their will to live. 

The 27 became a world of it\'s own, slowly growing, speeding through the
empty reaches of space toward their rendezvous with the Third Imperium. In
- -240, the first report of a rumored giant sub-light ship filtered through
the free trader network back to the Federation. By -180 it was clear the
ship was approaching, and it was steadily decelerating. It was headed
towards a system with a sparsely inhabited agricultural world in the
Geshaggere system. In -168, as they slowed to a wide looping orbit around
the primary, the Forlorn were astonished to find themselves met by other
humans in spacecraft. They were almost as astonished as the Scouts who met
them. 

Thus began the last upheaval in the lives of the Forlorn.

After 1500 years of believing that they were the only humans in existence,
the shock of finally coming to rest, and finding, not only humans, but
humans who could travel faster than light, humans who had spread to
thousands of worlds, humans who were already living on the beautiful
planet that they had come to think of as their new home was more than many
could take. To many this was a time as dark as the original Destruction.
To many their struggle to live over the last 1500 years had been an
exercise in futility...they thought they were the salvation of humanity.
An epidemic of depression and suicide swept the Forlorn. 

Worse, when some of them ventured down to the planet, they found it was
not a place they found fit to live in, it was dirty, smelly, disease
ridden. They weighed too much, many were utterly paralyzed from the
weight, and most of them suffered from horrible agoraphobia. They were
used only to no horizon in the space between ships, or a ships hull, at
most, a hundred meters away; a horizon line many kilometers or hundreds of
kilometers away left them reeling with dizziness, nausea, and a feeling of
panic. 

Soon, the survivors realized that after all this time, they HAD a home,
and it was on their familiar, beloved 27.  They realized that now they no
longer had to depend on capturing material atom by atom, but they could
comb the system they were in for material. They could construct large new
habitats, fill them with their recycler farms, their beloved strinthee\'s,
and grow. Their depression turned to exhilaration, as they realized that
they, of all the people they\'d met were the most suited to living in
space. They had technologies far in advance of the Imperium, in some
respects: in the areas of large scale life support systems, zero gee
construction, long distance sensors and analysis, manipulation of magnetic
fields, hydroponics farming they were at least TL 13-14. In this they at
least had something to offer the Federation. They were fortunate their
first contacts were with a honest scout from an honest large corporation.
Their secrets weren\'t stolen from them, and their interests were properly
represented during the chaotic first years of their recontact with
humankind. 

It is doubtful that they\'d be as lucky in today\'s expansionist
environment. 

The Forlorn: In the Imperium

The Forlorn have increased their numbers since arriving in the Imperium,
with a total population now somewhere around 5-8 million. There are
pockets of them throughout the old Sylean Confederation space. Forlorn
work teams are in high demand for zero gee construction, and Forlorn
designed life support systems are sold throughout the Imperium for use in
vacuum and hostile environment habitats. Forlorn researchers are found in
the IISS research branch, where they are working on long distance sensor
and survey techniques

Still, most Forlorn are still clustered in the Geshaggere system, living
and working in their growing cluster of habitats at Geshaggere\'s lagrange
points. They are acutely aware that they are, by now, quite different from
the people they have settled amidst, and feel considerably lost unless
they are with a number of other Forlorn. Their history of intense
community cooperation have made them even more group oriented than the
Vilani, though without the technological conservatism that marks Vilani
culture. They have a distinct language, that they work assiduously to keep
alive, as they do their rich oral history and traditions. 

They have a love of brightly colored clothing and surroundings, of music,
of food.  They have embraced a number of foods from their new
surroundings, blending them into their cuisine as the plants have proven
to be compatible with their farming systems. 

Outside of the Geshaggere system, they are most often found in family
groups of 15-45 individuals, never solitary. They have been the target of
more than a little discrimination, for their habits of travelling in
groups, their strange language, their habitual use of filter masks in the
presence of outsiders, and more often, their disdain for those they
consider \'Drangin\', \'dirt-bugs\', their derogatory term for anyone who
isn\'t happier living at zero-g in a nice clean space habitat. In other
words, anyone who lives on a planet.  Most Forlorn feel they are truly the
only modern humans, living free from their planetary bonds. All of endless
space is their homeland. 

Forlorn innovations:

Life support systems. Forlorn life support systems are really designed for
use in large habitats, or very large ships; they are unsuitable for use in
small ships. They are a combination recycling system/farm, using a
combination of plants, algae, and some rather exotic polymer and
metallopolymer membrane systems to maintain a healthy atmosphere, food,
and water supply over long, practically infinite periods of time. These
systems are much more efficient than current Imperial life support
systems, but need more attention and are at times quite susceptible to
\'poisoning\' by outside contaminants, such as heavy metals, bacteria and
fungi. They work best when a \'clean\' system can be erected, such as on a
vacuum world, or in orbit, where some decontamination can be set up for
incoming personnel. 

They have smaller systems for use on board small ships, which are more
like small hydroponic gardens more than anything else. These cannot
replace full life support systems, but rather, provide an extra amount of
\'conditioning\' to the system, particularly the air supply, removing trace
irritants, and adding the impossible-to- replicate scents of living
plants. Ships that carry such systems do not receive any cut in costs for
life support, but can realize an increased 5-10% on middle and high
passage fare, because the systems simply make it more pleasant to be on
board. 

PC\'s could well want to invest in one of these systems, not only for the
increased revenue, but again, because it\'s a lot more pleasant to be on a
ship with one. 

Forlorn \'Life Conditioning Unit\': Displaces 2 dT/100 dT of ship to be
\'conditioned\', requires minimal power, and requires 0.1 Crew member/ dT
for maintenance and operation, counted as Steward. 

Magnetic field manipulation:

The Forlorn\'s only resupply system during their centuries in flight were
their laboriously adapted magnetic radiation and particle shields (Their
original ships were to carry the fuel they needed). They became adept at
manipulating magnetic fields within the low power constraints of their
systems, filtering the scant detrius of interstellar space for hydrogen,
carbon monoxide, methane, and rarer molecules. They have a large practical
knowledge of this subject, but since most of their experience is a
significant fractions of c, the practicality and usability of their
technology is questionable in the much lower speed Imperium. Still they
have struggled to make some headway. 

MagSieve Magnetic \'sieve\' for recovering low concentrations of material
from plasma, gaseous, or other extremely low density media. Basically a
variation of the Bussard Ramjet; this is a system that can collect
specifically sized molecules or atoms from some medium. Currently used
experimentally for recovering trace resources from cometary belts, the
upper reaches of Gas Giants, proto star systems, or similar environments.
This is currently experimental technology, and is still somewhat of a
\'solution without a problem\'. The advantage of this system is that it
could be converted to a rugged, automated system. Resource concentrations
may be low in Cometary belts, or particularly proto-star systems, but a
simple device that can operate for months or years without service could
collect a huge amount of material. Forlorn control of magnetic fields,
however is still pretty much confined to low power applications. 

Zero Gee construction:

Forlorn structures are marvels of maximum strength with minimum mass, and
their abilities to work on and manipulate structures in zero gee are
almost inborn by now. They have developed a number of specialized
composites and alloys for such use. Their structures are often designed to
withstand stresses in very defined directions, and Forlorn designs often
resemble elaborate spiderwebs of tension elements, often looking no more
substantial than balsa wood models. 

Forlorn structures are typically built in place as they cannot withstand
the forces required to boost them into position. However, they are often
far more economical of construction time, material and volume than
\'normally\' designed orbital hab\'s or structures, and have found a niche
for use as astronomical observatories, deep space sensor platforms or comm
relays, or belter habitats. 

Some of their engineering elements and composites are finding their way
into Imperial engineering practice, as well, and there is a noted Forlorn
occupying the Branfield chair at the Sylea Institute of Technology. Well,
she doesn\'t actually occupy the chair, but rather an orbital habitat near
Sylean Highport, which serves as a classroom/summer camp/laboratory for
students in her program of Alternative Construction Methods. She simply
telecommutes for all her ordinary departmental duties. 

Miscellaneous Forlorn Library data:

Groukit: This is one of the few plants the Forlorn were able to retain
from the Destruction. In it\'s most primitive, base form, it is a low, fast
growing, squashlike vegetable. It was originally intended to be a food
source and \'air conditioner\' plant, since it has large leaves for
relatively high rates of respiration. It has been manipulated into a large
number of variants providing everything from dyes to food to fibers for
cloth. Even now, after an influx of new plants, the Groukit has an
important place in Forlorn agriculture, and even more, an important place
in the Forlorn heart. Every household has a large, lavishly cared for
Groukit in a place of honor in their main room. 

Strinthee: This is the only animal from their home world that the Forlorn
have left. All the other species they were taking with them were lost with
the rest of the Fleet. The strinthee is a small omnivorous quadruped,
massing 1-4 kilos, which occupied the same niche on their home world as
the modern house cat, as a pet and predator on small pests. Long
considered lucky on ships, both surface and spacegoing, there were
numerous strinthees on all of the ships of the Fleet. Strinthee\'s are well
adapted for zero-gee life as well, since the evolved from small arboreal
omnivores. They do not have prehensile taile or opposable thumbs, but are
otherwise quite dextrous. Strinthee\'s are as much a part of a family as
the any other Forlorn, and though they are quite inquisitive at times,
they will tend to stay within sight or scent distance of their family. 

Forlorn societal structure: The Forlorn, more than any other society in
the Imperium value the group, over the individual. Decisions, major, and
minor are often made by consensus. While this can slow negotiations with
non- Forlorn, this means that agreements are well thought out.
Paradoxically, though, the Forlorn value innovative thinking by
individuals as well, since many times throughout their history, it was
only the quick actions and ideas of individuals that saved them. Forlorn
schooling focuses a great deal on rapid, iterative problem solving: " Fix
it NOW, then fix it better, until it\'s done right" rather than "study it
to death, then fix it right"...far too often in their history what would
have been dead would have been them. The Forlorn, in other words, are
inveterate tinkerers. 

Since the entire 27 came to become, essentially, an extended village, the
Forlorn concept of \'group\' includes all the Forlorn in existence. They do
recognize more immediate familial groups, and Forlorn living arrangements
are usually oriented around this size group, which will usually consist of
a biologically related extended family.  Forlorn are very gregarious,
though, and larger communities tend to still act in a very unified
fashion. The initial screening of their remote descendants, and the
intervening 1500 years of isolation, with the vastly smaller initial
population of the 27, means that the Forlorn, while considerably more
genetically homogenous than the Imperial norm, are relatively free of
genetic diseases. 

They are, in general, more susceptible to diseases and infections than the
Imperial norm. This accounts for their habitually wearing filter masks and
full cover outer garments in areas where they have wide contact with
outsiders and their pathogens, particularly in their rare ventures onto a
planet. Physically they are taller, much thinner, and often weaker than
the Imperial norm, although this is mostly the effects of life led at low
or zero-gee;  there are some Forlorn who are adapted to higher gee
environments. Most have long, nimble toes, as well, and some can use them
almost as facilely as hands. Zero-gee has other advantages as well. Most
Forlorn are quite long lived, due to the lessened strain of gravity on
their bodies, as well as the low calorie diet they maintain.

There has been some mixing of the Forlorn and Imperial humans, but their
greater susceptibility to disease and cultural differences have combined
to keep the Forlorn a fairly insular group, and \'adopted\' Imperials are a
small minority. 

At home, Forlorn have a wide variety of dress, often in wild colors. Their
love of color and visual variety extends to the rest of their environment,
too. Forlorn habitats are riots of colors, small nooks and crannies filled
with bits of stuff, knicknacks, plants, materials \'put aside\' (the Forlorn
are still fanatic recylclers...any bit of metal, plastic, wood or other
material that left over from anything, will get scooped up, and put aside
for recycling later.) Older Forlorn, in particular, also have a
significant \'thing-itis\', the urge to collect all sorts of
\'things\'...mostly small and decorative, or something with some utility,
they are closer to the time when all they had was the 27; there are, in
fact a number of them who were alive before the fleet stopped.  They
remember the days when a small decorative object was truly a treasure,
when everything was assembled, atom by atom from the magnetic nets. 

The Forlorn, as a group have an acute awareness of the fact that they are
the ONLY of their kind that have ever been found. A significant sect among
them are the \'Ill\'ikashi\', \'Rejoiners\' in Galanglic. They believe that
when the great fleet was scattered, the 27 were not the only ships to
survive. If they were able to survive, then surely there were others. They
believe that it is a duty of theirs to seek out and find their lost
people, knowing that this is a monumental task. Their rituals are mostly
small reminders of the lost ships; on more important occasions, extra
place settings are set out for the lost, as if they might appear at any
moment. Astronomy and other sensor-based sciences are honored professions
among the Ill\'ikashi, and they form the bulk of the Forlorn who work for
the IISS. 

The majority of the Forlorn, however, believe that they were the only ones
spared, and it is their duty to retain their history and traditions. A
formalized expression of this is the \'Deltra Harissim\', literally the
\'Society of Makers\', a honorary fraternity of engineers, another
profession held in high esteem by the Forlorn. Members of the group are
the keepers of the \'Marakin\' or \'Ships Log\'; the recorded history of the
Forlorn.

There are numerous facimile copies available, now that the Forlorn have
access to the materials and technology, but the Marakin, distinguished by
the capitalization, is still kept by the chief of the Deltra Harrisim,
using paper made from specialized groukit leaves. It is in the in the
center of Forlorn culture, on the 27, maintained now as a museum/shrine in
the Geshaggere system.

The Marakin itself consists of some 4700 volumes of hand written history,
stretching back to the time immediately after The Destruction and the
scattering of the fleet. The earliest books are never handled any more,
they are the original engineers hasty notes on construction of the
original 27, listing the modifications to the ships controls and
mechanisms, inventories of material, preliminary designs of recycling
equipment, all written on cheap bound notepads, scraps of paper, bits of
packing....anything they could get their hands on. The Marakin evolved
into a written history about ten years into the voyage, as it seemed that
they might, after all, just might make it. These earliest volumes are far
too fragile to handle, and much of the information in them is impossible
to get to, and what is known about the contents has been lost or garbled
over the ages. The Deltra Harissim are undertaking research into how to
access the records without harming them, and the Ill\'ikashi are
enthusiastic partners in this, as they believe clues to their origin, and
possible tracking the Lost Ships lie in these books. 

They have contracted with the Alkhalikoi Institute of Archaeology on Sylea
in this endeavor, and several visiting scientists from there are living
and working in the 27. 

One of them, Dr Muthahti Vinoosh, has written a minor best-seller
recounting her time on the Marakin project, and with the Forlorn. This
light, affectionate portrayal of her hosts has earned Dr. Vinoosh
reciprocal affection from the Forlorn, and has softened their image as
insular, arrogant masked strangers for a wider range of people in the
Imperium.

This is a critical point that Leonard makes.  There is a big
difference between how the combat system models how often you hit
the target, and what a given hit actually does.  Since these are
separate in traveller, the damage system should be rather nasty,
IMO.

The to-hit probs should take care of making it less nasty overall.

So check the to-hits and see how likely it is.  If it is easy (
don\'t have T4 in front of me now) then I\'d assume that it is under
more controlled circumstances.  I\'d give -DMs for shooting while
moving or under cover, etc. So in a real firefight, hitting somebody
might be pretty rare (as a function of rounds fired), but if you get
hit you\'re in trouble.

Damara autopsied a guy hit with a .25 that went through a window,
bounced off the table (grazing) and hit his chest.  Took off an
aorta (bad luck, eh?).

especially the question about a swarm at the Trojan point of a gas gaint.
The real problem with swarms is their limited lifetime (on an astronomical
timescale). If the orbits are crossing and the asteroids are colliding,
they are loosing energy as well as being ground to dust. They would
eventually begin to merge into a single body due to their mutual
gravitational attraction. Depending on the level of the perturbations from
other bodies, the asteroids might form into a single body (perhaps with a
highly heated core from graviational effects) or never completely collapse
forming a cloud equavilent to a planetary ring. If the perturbations were
too strong, many of the asteroids would be ejected from the swarm too
quickly for this to happen. This is not to say at a swarm at a Trojan point
could not exist for a short (astronomical time scale) period. A large
asteroid could be captured at the Trojan point and break up, somewhat like
Comet Shoemaker-Levy (it passed within the Roche limit).


Planetary rings are a special case for stability resulting from the
interaction with moons. I\'ve done some work with artifical satellite
break-ups in earth orbit. The pieces start off as a swarm, but very quickly
form a ring which spreads into a shell or torus. The driving factor here is
the distribution of velocities given to the pieces at the breakup. A very
low energy break-up would spread more slowly.

All of this is off the top of my head; it would make an interesting study.
The problem with being an astronomer is that you can think of all sorts of
factors and special conditions. (Also there is a reluctance to make a
definate statement that someone else can prove to be wrong.) There are some
n-body simulations available.  I\'ve seen some for star clusters in Sky and
Telescope that could be modified. They may be at the Sky & Tel web site
software area.

It was an impressive scene in ESB!

Very similar to Albedo Anthropomorphics.  After rolling for the hit...
	 ( rolled on comparison chart based on  <[attackers skill + mods] -
[range/difficulty + mods]> ),  
...rolls are made for the location of the hit, if it penetrated any
armor, and the severity.  The severity table has 5 columns--each for a
type of weapon (1 is projectile weapons, 4 is for blunt melee weapons) a
roll of 2D, modified by hit location and weapon type is made on the
appropriate column.  Armor modifies the column if it is successful in
stopping the blow (i.e. flak vests change a gunshot wound into a blunt
trauma wound).  The result from the table contains two effects: type of
wound (Grazing, Minor, Major, Catastrophic) and the stun effect
(Staggered, Stunned, Knocked Down, Knocked Out).  It is possible to be
hit, stunned and recieve no wound, but there\'s almost no chance to take
a wound and not be stunned.

For example, Joe Furry, EDF, is wearing his flak armor and is hit by
sniper fire.  He\'s hit in the upper arm where he has the benifit of a
shoulder guard.  A quick comparision roll of the weapon\'s penetration
vs. his armor reveals his armor has not been breached.  
The flak armor\'s impact distribution is 2, so a roll is made on the 3rd
column.  A roll of 2D6 (plus 4 for the ammo the sniper used) results in
"st/GR" or stunned, Grazing wound.
Joe loses several actions (the stun effect) and gets a bruise on his
right arm.  A DM of +1 is applied to all Strength tasks Joe performs for
the next day or so

Wounds, depending on thier location, will have different effects on
tasks... your character can take a Major wound to the arm (i.e. broken
bones) and make DRIVE (willpower) roll to continue performing actions
(with some hefty DRMs--no one said it would be easy), but a Major wound
to the torso means you sit down and stay there (well, if you make a
difficult DRIVE check, you can probably crawl a bit...)

Albedo\'s system is deadly, but not gory.  Medical attention after combat
is lots of First-Aid rolls, doses of painkillers, quick medivacs andlong
stays in hospitals.

	Ahem... I should point something out here; not all Qu=E9becois are
separatists, despite what the separatists would have you believe.
Regardless of whether you define Qu=E9becois as citizens of Qu=E9bec, or in =
the
racist definition that the separatists use, only pur laine francophones,
only about 30% of the population of the province, i.e. a minority of
francophone Qu=E9becois are separatists.  The only reason they got an
apparent support of 49% in the last referendum was due to a bungled
campaign by the No side, an incredibly charismatic and popular leader for
the Yes side, and a dishonest and misleading question.

	Basically, 49% of Qu=E9becois voted yes to a proposition that would
have Qu=E9bec becoming "sovereign within the context of a new partnership
with the rest of Canada" (whatever the hell that means).  They voted Yes to
a deal whereby they\'d still send MP\'s to Ottawa, still benefit from
Canada\'s membership in GATT and NAFTA, still keep their Canadian passports,
and still use the Canadian dollar.  Exit polls revealed that between 20-30%
of the Yes vote was voting for this, which they thought was a form of
renewed federalism.  It\'s lucky for us that they didn\'t get a majority,
because as Mr. Parizeau, the then PQ premier, said afterwards that he was
going to unilaterally declare independence regardless of what happened in
any negotiations.  As it happened, all he was able to do was bitch about
"how money and the ethnic vote cost us our country" in his concession
speech.  That one cost him his job, but to this day he has yet to apologize
for it.

	Ask an honest question, such as "Do you want Qu=E9bec to become an
independent country", with an honest statement of the true costs of
separation (assumption of a fair share of the national debt and partition
of the province) and the Yes vote will tank.  So please don\'t go thinking
that all Qu=E9becois are separatists.  They aren\'t; francophone Qu=E9becois =
are
generally very open-minded and tolerant.  While the separatists try and
pull an "ein volk ein partei"-style conflation, they\'re really only a vocal
minority.

	ObTrav:  Like, maybe this could inspire some subtleties for your
adventure idea?  Such as total chaos where the separatist government in
question got apparent support, got a dog\'s breakfast of a deal instead of
what they promised, and is bulldozing it through despite popular
opposition, ethnic violence, economic collapse, and so forth?

I acknowledge this completely - in fact, that was my personal goal in this
competition - to make the smallest ship possible that was capable of
fufilling the mission. Dr. Clark feels that I failed...I think I didn\'t.
Who knows :)

> No meson or dampers, a single laser, 
These two fall under my "patrol cruiser" clause. Yes - the design called
for a ship capable of serving with fleet elements. However, the design is
primarily a anti-pirate/customs/commerse-raider, and I feel NDs and meson
screens are grossly overkill for that. When a 300-600ton ship is assigned
to a fleet, I do not expect it will be a line ship - instead they will be
used (IMHO) as pickets, scouts, armed couriers, and "big fighters". When
designing the ship, I asked myself two questions - "Can this ship take on
corsairs and win? And is this ship useful to a larger fleet?" The answer to
the first I feel is yes - the armor, long-range laser, high speed, EMM, and
heavy missile load make this a superb (IMHO) pirate killer. And yes, it can
serve with fleet elements - again, as a scout, picket, etc...but, as a ship
of the line (of sorts), I agree with Dr. Clark - my design has
shortcomings.
Note that some of the modules (Point Defences, Nuclear Damper, Addl
laser(s)) would be very useful in fleet roles.

> small sensors, 
I picked the best package available in SSDS...here\'s an example of QSDS
beating SSDS (the other example being fuel refining plants).

> and little cargo space
This is perhaps the only one I disagree with...12 tons, without using
modules. And note that you do not have to use cargo space for missiles - I
provided extra space for that. I wonder why a patrol cruiser needs more
space.

An observation - I was amazed at the number of designs that didn\'t have
dedicated troop space. I feel that troops are a basic anti-piracy tool,
even if the design parameters didn\'t mention them.

It is possible to design a ship that perhaps Dr. Clark would like a bit
better - 300tons, 4G maneuver, 2 laser batteries, NDs, meson screen. The
lasers are slightly less powerful than my single battery, the ship only
pulls 4Gs, the armor drops to 30, and the number of troops falls to 4. I
personally prefer my initial design - but that\'s a matter of preferences.

Again, thanks to Dr. Clark for his opinions...

	You wouldn\'t happen to have a similar system we could look at lying around 
somewhere, do you? I\'ve always wanted a damage system where:
	a) targets die instantly less than 9 times out of 10;
	b) arm shots actually HURT;
	c) you stand as much of a chance of getting seriously injured as the Bad Guys;
	d) you\'re still feeling the effects more than 24 hours later;
	e) marksmanship COUNTS;
	f) cover is a necessity;
	g) more closely models real-life GSW effects.
	Unfortunately, I know very little about designing such a system, as I am only 
on step 8 of the 12-step program for reforming munchkins. (Now, class, I want you to

May I add a plea to include 3D vectors, even if in an abstract form. I have
never seen 3D movement handled simply and effectively in a game, except
perhaps in StarForce and there movement was more strategic than tactical.

I realize if this was easy to do every game would have it. Consider it a
challenge; how do we represent 3D vectors on a hex map simply and
effectively? Solving this will give Traveller an advantage over all the
other space games and perhaps form a basis for other games from IG.

Roger Penrose uses this idea to argue against the possibility of \'hard\' AI.
One problem is that such microtubules occur in nearly all animal cells, not
just the brain, and may also exist in plant cells and mineral formations.

Nevertheless, I have used some of his arguments to handwave why there are
not AIs in Traveller. The real reason, of course, is that we want players

I agree that from a design standpoint, bunks are smaller and take less
power, so based on simple finances one might think bunks are more cost
effective than staterooms. However, I don\'t agree that skimping on crew
space will provide more firepower. At least, more firepower that will hit
enemy ships.

First of all, to attract and keep a high-quality crew you have got to
provide them comfortable sleeping quarters. In WWII  you could get away
with putting conscripts into floating sardine cans, but contract employees,
like Imperial Navy crew, can simply change jobs if they don\'t like the
working conditions. I\'m no naval admiral, but I believe that crew which has
good living conditions will perform more effectively and with better morale
than crew treated like human cordwood.

Second, starship crews cannot surface or stroll the deck on a break; there
is no outside of a ship in jump space. Any room for study, recreation,
briefing, or training must be inside the ship and bunks provide no space
for this. Some members of the crew, like gunnery, will have no duties
during jump and will be more useful training or performing maintenance.
Having to do this in available space, like engineering or the bridge, will
impede normal ship operations.

Third, starships in the Third Imperium are not like U Boats. Space travel
has been around for millennia and starship design is by now highly
optimized and effective. The rules state command personnel and passengers
must have staterooms, so there must be some advantage in doing this.
Whether for morale, carrying out one\'s work, or just economics, the same
principles will apply to all crewmembers. Naval architects aren\'t going to
put staterooms in unless they give some advantage. While a high passenger
or ship captain may have more clout, what\'s good for the captain is good
for the lowliest gunner.

Therefore, your choice is really between untrained, unmotivated slave labor
with more weaponry, or highly trained and motivated combat professionals
with fewer weapons. Frankly, the untrained crew will have zero firepower if
they mutiny at the first sight of an enemy ship. For me, this also is a
clear cut choice, but other navies may have different philosophies.
Unfortunately, Traveller\'s space combat system has no rules for crew
quality, so the comparison between the two will for now be only
theoretical.

In my campaign, all military ships have at least a small stateroom for
every two crewmembers, and personal staterooms for every crewmember on
capital ships.

The number of integers is infinite, refered to as aleph-null (Hebrew letter
aleph, subscript 0).

Between every two integers there are an infinite number of real numbers,
refered to as aleph-prime.

These two inifinities are mathematically different.  I can\'t remember enough

It\'s a scalar. Honest. Look it up.

KE=1/2mv^2, so we have:
initial state: KE=1/2(1000kg)*(0m/s)*(0m/s) + 1/2(1000kg)*(0m/s)*(0m/s)
final state: KE=1/2(1000kg)*(1m/s)*(1m/s)+1/2(1000kg)*(-1m/s)*(-1m/s)
               =500 J + 500 J = 1000 J

Where, you might ask, did the energy come from? It came from your muscles,
heaving the block, converting chemical potential energy into kinetic energy.

This is high-school physics.

No. Total kinetic energy of the system is increasing in all frames of reference,
as nuclear binding energy (from fusing hydrogen) is converted into electricity
and then (miraculously) into kinetic energy.

I could be wrong on this, of course, but it might have something to 
do with the incredible feeling of having the baby move inside of you, 
for the first time, the second, the hundredth. It might be the wonder 
of poking at your stomach and feeling it kick back. It might be the 
incredible joy of seeing that tiny little person for the first time, 
still attached to your life blood and feeling him/her laid on your 
stomach, touching you on the outside for the first time.

There aren\'t enough words in our language to describe the instinct 
that drives a more or less sane, rational woman to want to have a 
baby, to give up so much and gain so much more.

Is it a given that as technology increases, women will choose to not 
carry them? I can\'t believe it.  I was adopted. I *know* that there 
is no difference in the mother/daughter bond, but I wouldn\'t have 
traded my pregnancies and births merely because it was convenient or 
easier.

Leonard, I usually admire your science and engineering skills, but I think
it\'s time for you to alter the dosage or something. :)  KE (like PE, like
energy in general) is by definition a scalar quantity.  Consider that you
say above that you \'heave\' the block.  That introduces KE into the system
(tranformed from chemical energy in your body, or whatever).  Your final
state has more KE (in the initial rest frame) than the initial one.
*Momentum* is conserved and is a vector quantiry; kinetic energy is *not*
conserved and is a scalar quantity.  Big difference.

This is almost hallucinatorily weird.  I\'d love to see a universe that

Again, you *can* add or subtract KE from a system, by transforming other
forms of energy to or from KE.

Wrong. Total KE is 1000 J. Energy is or it isn\'t. If the number is positive
then it is KE. If the number is negative it is heat and sub-elements of
the original members. The only time these objects would sum as you claim was
immediately at the point of contact of an inelastic collision.

The momentum (ie p=mv) is a vector and sums this way. Energy (ie e=mv^2)
is a scalar (those pesky squares just mess everything up).

Hope this helps.

Why?

What\'s the *reason* non-grav focused lasers are more efficient?  How does
grav focusing make a laser less efficient?  Is it just because FFS setup
the tables that way?  Or is it just because with non-focused lasers all the
energy goes into lasing, rather than generating the grav focusing effect? 
IAC, the effect is whatever we want it to be, because grav focusing is a
*total* speculation.

I\'m not going to extend the philosphical end of this thread, but I wanted
to make a comment about this sentence fragment.

It\'s interesting that most DNA is packed with extranious..as far as we
know..noninformational data.  A story in Analog a couple of years ago
speculated that our DNA is encoded with data placed there, in some way, by
alien progenitors.

Yeah, so let\'s move Admiral Rickover from subs to spaceplanes and power it

Ahhh, finally a chance to put that rusty old calculus to use. ;-)

your formula is equivalent to: v(t) = (2Pt/M)^(1/2)

I shall use the pipe | as the symbol of integration, and since Power and 
Mass do not change with respect to time, I shall replace the constant 
portion sqrt(2P/M) with c. So the formula to integrate becomes

|v(t) = |(c t^(1/2) dt) = c | (t^(1/2) dt)

Knowing that |(x^a dx) = [x^(a+1)]/(a+1), we get:

|v(t) = c * [t^(3/2)/(3/2)] = 2c/3 * t^(3/2) = 2/3 * sqrt(2Pt^3/M)

So that\'s your distance formula as a function of time:
d(t) = 2/3 * sqrt(2Pt^3/M)

*Real* mathematicians will, I\'m sure, tell me if I\'ve made an error. ;-)

So, to use your example:

d^2 = 4/9 * 2 Pt^3/M
9/8 * d^2 * M/P = t^3

100 dia= 1,120,000 km
1.12e9 = distance
1e5=100,000=m (100 tons)
1e8=100,000,000=p (100 MW)

9/8 * (1.12e9)^2 * 1e5/1e8 = t^3
9/8e3 * 1.2544e18 = t^3
t^3 = 1.41e15 
t =~ 11200 s ~ 31 hr

Does that sound about right, Leonard? I\'m not so sure that it meets the 
requirement of being a short enough time... maybe we need to pump more 
power into those Thrusters?

I remember reading a Russian sci-fi short story about some explorers who
enter a system, set off a big flare along the lines you describe, and set
about exploring... on one of the planets, they find the remains of a
(low-tech) alien civilization, still in the process of dying out.  They
can\'t figure it out -- the aliens seem to have no visual organs, but also
don\'t seem to have compensatory senses.  There are a few survivors
floundering about the abandoned towns, rapidly dying due to accidents and
general helplessness -- they can\'t seem to find their way around.
Eventually one of the explorers realizes that they\'re not naturally blind
- -- that their vision was in the same general wavelength as the survey
flare, which burned out their "eyes" and basically killed off the entire
species... <G>

Anyone remember what this story is or who wrote it?  It was translated into
English and appeared in one of those black-covered paperback "Soviet SF"
series that Theodore Sturgeon did the intros for, is all I can remember.

I gather that timing the intercourse (or turkey baster) can favor male vs.
female offpsring:  closer to ovulation, the better the chances of a male
child; farther away from ovulation, the slower but longer-lived \'female
sperm\' are more likely to make it to the egg.  Tipping the pH balance can
also tilt the odds, with acidic environments tending to kill the more
fragile Y-chromosome-bearing sperm first.  Hence the use of vinegar douches
by lesbian parents who\'d rather not have a boy... or so I\'m told.  Never
tried it myself.  If this isn\'t a bunch of malarkey, then yeah, it doesn\'t
get much lower-tech than this, and it could work to allow human Aslan clans
to maintain the \'correct\' sex ratio in their ranks.

Yeah, I\'ve read that there\'s already a measurable imbalance in the sex
ratio of the generation born post-Cultural Revolution -- disproportionately
few women.  It *will* be interesting to see what starts happening in
another ten years or so.

Or it could be that genetical memory data some speculate in a la Bene
Gesserit of Herbert. The grandfather theory though seems more interesting
except that he seems to have put the data into all earthly organisms that
we have checked so far. Maybe all data the senses of the organism pick up
is checked with this data and if a match the organism will self destruct or
something. Sort of a programmers backdoor to kill of any dangerous
organisms when they reach a certain TL. The Darrians code didn\'t work so he
had to flare them (the star trigger was only a coverup from him).

Can we also get a posting up of what changes need to be made to the
QSDS/SSDS systems? I\'ve got a couple here (QSDS HEPlaR fuel needs
to be multiplied by20, and a list of suggested crew salaries to use) but I
know that a couple of other things (such as the recent question over
QSDS lasers vs SSDS lasers) have slipped past without my grabbing
the pertinent info. Has anyone been collecting this in order to a) make
sure all the ship designs are using the same rules/assumptions and b) to
make a complete list of corrections for the two design systems?

I use a system that combines the Chaosium points for success and the Vampirish/
yourish points for roleplay. The problems with sticking entirely w/ #4 or #5
is that
a) not all my players are equal in the role-playing department, so some would 
tend to get slighted and b) all of my group grew up playing D&D, CoC, etc, and
have that indoctrination that says getting points for using your skills well
feels
more "natural," and would feel slighted if they didn\'t get points for being the
most effective in a gun fight.

Since I wrote one of the original 2-3 posts on this idea, I think I might
have a 
few ideas about it. <g> I think of the opening into this heat dimension as
analogous to _Flatland_; imagine the ship as a 2D object for a sec, kinda 
like a deckplan. The jumpspace "bubble" exists around the ship in the 2D 
plane (in the same way the bubble wraps around the actual 3D ship). The
"hole" into the "heat dimension" opens out of the page into 3D space, the
same as the "real" hole opens "out" of the ship into 4D (or 5, 6, 42, whatever)
space, thus not interacting at all with the jump bubble (which is interacting
with the j-dimension, not the h-dimension.

I have no problem with the "heat field" critically collapsing if insufficient
heat is pumped into it; catastrophe if your jdrive fails, catastrophe if your
pplant fails. Sounds fair. The "heat input as a barrier" was a response to get
around the problem of the "h-dimension" having to be far colder than our
space to have effective heat transfer.

Which is why the barrier idea came to me. Is there any reason that heat energy
couldn\'t be used as a barrier against the h-dimension the way that a jump
bubble uses <mumble, mumble, handwave> energy against the j-dimension?

OK, taking a page from the "black swans in England" argument, I
am postulating a game universe in which a dimension has been found that
allows heat to be "dumped" (for lack of a better term). This dimension is
a one-way transfer, and no dimension has (yet) been found that allows 
heat to be drawn out of it. There, does that cover the bases? Or do I need
to handwave a few trees whose sap can be used for flame retardant
undies? :)

Yes, that point has been raised, and I\'m not arguing with it. But the 
questions were also asked (and not answered): 1) how much energy could
one derive from such a device and would it be more economical (in
terms of volume/mass/cost) than existing canon power sources, 2) why 
is perptual energy in this sense worse than super-efficient solar cells, 
and 3) in the example of dropping (a very large one) into a star as a 
weapon, why is that worse than the Star Trigger?

And this isn\'t a formal challenge either. I\'m not looking for acrimony, flames,
sarcasm, or anything other than a conversation/discussion about the 
merits of the idea; I\'ve been reading the bios that have been posted, and
for a bunch of 30 and 40 something professionals, we all (self included) 
certainly seem to get our knickers in a twist about as often as a bunch of
12 year olds on AOL. :) I know the post was old, but I\'ve been enjoying 
a week off w/ my significant ones (away from email distractions, *ahhh*)
and as one of the people posting/following the thread, I\'d like a few
additional questions answered, if it pleases the court :)

After all, it is a little more on topic than the "History of Sexual
Practices" or
"This is My Life" threads as of late, as interesting as they may be. :)

Last month, we (I\'m an RN on a Neurosciences/Neurosurgical unit) 
had a cabbie who was shot in the head w/ a .32 that basically lodged 
in her skull. A quick and (relatively) easy operation, a couple of days
on the floor for obs, and she\'s probably out driving her cab again.

I guess that\'s why we have the spectacular successes and failures :)

First get rid of the stupid hexes. Use square grids and have one top view
and one side view and use past-present-future ala BR and Mayday. The two
view grid was used by SPI Battlefield Mars (or am I erring on the title?).
The problem is 3D gravity but with the boring scales in BR gravity is not a
factor.

an immediate aplication for the combat/damage system which uses the T4 rules

makes more sense. So,

The 3-Task System: An alternative Task and Combat System for T4

One and only requisiste: Remember the multiples of three: 3,6,9,12,15,18,21

Tasks:

	Maximum allowed DM: +10

	Difficulty	Code

	Easy		6+
	Average	        9+
	Difficult	12+
	Formidable	15+
	Staggering	18+
	Impossible	21+

	Note: Average characters got a DM of +2 from a level-7 attribute, which
explains Average being 9+.
	
	This system is very similar to MT, but designed for T4 characters who have
a significatively larger number of skills. For most characters, Easy,
Average and Difficult are roughly equivalent to Easy, Routine and Difficult
in MT. Formidable somewhere between Difficult and Formidable in MT,
Staggering somewhere betwwn Formidable and Impossible in MT.

	Spectacular Success: When the actual roll makes the next difficulty level
(i.e. exceeds the required level by 3+). Example: Rolling 12+ in an Average
task.

	Spectacular Failure: When the actual roll does NOT make the previous
difficulty level (i.e. fails by 4+). Can give rise to a 2D mishap. Example:
Not rolling 6+ in an Average task.

	Marginal success: If the roll equals the required level exactly. Example:
Rolling exactly 7 in an Average task.

	Fumble: An exact roll of 2 is always a failure, regardless of DMs. Can give
rise to a 3D mishap.

=============

	Use the T4 difficulty levels and weapon DMs for the to hit tasks.
	For assessing damage, refer to the result of the task

	Fumble: Implement a 2D mishap.
	Spectacular Failure: Failed
	Failure: Failed
	Marginal Success: Only 1D damage from the attack is taken.
	Success: Normal T4 rules. Maximum 3D damage.
	Spectacular Success: No maximum damage, all the damage of the weapon is taken.

Variation: Record the Hit numbers from MT and substitute the dice of damage
for hits. For the "1" damage points generated by the T4 system, record each
three of them as a whole hit.

WARNING Severe Munchkinism Follows Read At Your Own Risk !

The true Traveller munchkin (in Milleau 1100) will design a hand held
Meson weapon so as not to insure that their oponents do not try & take
advantage of that pesky thing called armor.  This may involve some
creative interpretation of the chapter on Meson Guns. I should point out
in my own defence that _NO_ minimum values are given in the meson gun
design table so it may be a legitimate design. (FFS pg 116-120)

The following post involves a fair ammount of quoting of the FF&S rules
which are copyright Imperium Games & Marc Miller. 

Using Fire Fusion & Steel it is very easy to design a hand held Meson
gun FGMP style weapon for Battledress troups at TL 15.  The overall
dammage will be low but since it ignores armor it can be deadly.  It is 
also possible to generate a similar (but less effective) weapon at TL\'s
as low as 11.  Such a weapon will have a low rate of fire however. 

If a gravtank bothers you you can just vaporize the driver or the
controls & the tank will probably crash.   For _true_ munchkinism you
need a psionic firer because if the firer is psionic you can pass off a
target location aquired with telepathy or clairvoyance & may be able to
hit the brain directly.

A fairly deadly weapon can be designed with approximately the following
parameters: (Anglicizations have bben provided for the metric impaired)

TL 15 MGMP (Meson Gun Man Portable)

Step 1:  Involves chosing a Spinal, parallel, or Bay mount.  We will
ignore this step since our gun will be handheld.  We will select a
tunnel length at this ponit however.  We will pick 0.3 m (11.8 inches) 

Step 2:  Discharge Energy (DE)  0.04 megajoule

Step 3: Meson Tunnel Charecteristics

TL 14 Tunnel Charecteristics 
Length Multiplier 	1.2
Volume Multiplier	0.01
Mass Multiplier		0.6

3a: Effective Tunnel Length (0.3 m * 1.2) = 0.36 m

3b: Tunnel Volume (cubic meters)= actual length (m) * discharge energy
(megajoules) * volume multiplier
0.3 * 0.04 * 0.01 = 0.00012 cubic meter (120 cubic centimeters)

3c: Tunnel Cross-Sectional Area
Cross-sectional area in square meteres is equal to the tunnel volume
divided by the actual tunnel length.
0.00048/0.3 = 0.0004 square meter (4 square centimeters) This  means our
meson gun has a gun is approximate diamter of 1.128 (about .44 caliber)
  
3d: Tunnel Mass
Tunnel Mass (tonnes) = tunnel volume (cubic meters) * mass multiplier
0.00012 * 0.6 = 0.00007 tonnes (0.07 kg) (70 grams) (less than 2.5 oz)

3e: Tunnel Price (MCr)
tunnel volume (cubic meters) * 0.1 at all Tl\'s
0.00012 * 0.1 = 0.000012 MegaCredits (12 credits)

4: Performance
Effective range in km = effective tunnel length x 1000
0.36 * 1000 = 360 km  (223 miles)

5: Define Short Range
 This is where you select a beam pointer for your meson gun. The rules
state that all meson guns require a beam pointer.  if you wish to design
an effective hand held meson gun below Tl 15 you will probably need to
_ignore_ this rule because the beam pointer will be so heavy as to make
the gun impractical. (Arguably no small arm should require a beam
pointer since it will be manually fired).  

We will select the lightest possible beam pointer the 0.3km beam
pointer.
  At TL 15 this beam pointer will have the following stats
Volume 0.01 cubic meter (about 0.35 cubic foot) 
Mass 0.01 ton (10 kg)
Price (MCr) = volume * 0.1
0.01 * 0.1 = 0.001 MCr  (1000 credits)

If the weapon will be used by battle dress troups you may wish to use a
3 km beam pointer which will have twice the mass, volume, & cost.  If
this is a very high tech experimental secret weapon you may wish to use
a TL 17 beam pointer instead which will give  a 3km short range for the
same mass, volume and cost as our 0.3 km TL 15 beam pointer.

6: Combat Ratings

6a: Combat Range Bands

Short Range:	0.3 km / 300 meters
Medium Range:	0.6 km / 600 meters
Long Range:	1.2 km / 1200 meters
Extreme Range:  2.4 km / 2400 meters

(The maximum range at which a Meson gun will do dammage = 8,500 km *
effective tunnel length or 3,060 km for this design - since it will be
incapable of hitting anything at ranges greater than 2.4 km we will
ignore this range)

6b: Dammage Value
 
DV = 5 * I^0.5 		I is the weapons Intensity

I = DE / (R/EL)^2 	R is range in 1000\'s of km
			round (R/EL)^2 to the nearest 0.5 with a 			minimum of 1

0.1 / (0.0003/0.36)^2 =
0.1 / (0.000000694 which rounds up to 1)=
0.1 / 1 = 0.1 = I

DV = 5 * (0.04)^0.5
= 1

Our Meson gun does 1d6 of dammage _Ignoring Armor_

7: Power Requirements

7a: Input Energy	Meson guns have a 20% energy efficiency
InputEnergy (IE) = Discharge Energy / 0.2
0.04 / 0.2 = 0.32

7b: Homopolar Generator (I\'m really tempted to relate this back to the
Gays in The Third Imperium Thread but it\'s probably not a good idea :)
)		 
A meson gun requires a homopolar generator (HPG) to store the energy
required for each shot until that energy is ready to be deployed as a
single pulse.  Calculate this figure by muliplying the IE by the value
on the HPG table 
Volume = 0.32 * 0.035 = 0.0112 cubic meter (11.2 cubic liters)
mass = vol * 2 (tons)
0.112 * 2 = 0.0224 tons (22.4 kg)
Price (MCr) = vol * 0.1 * 1.1 (modified for Explosive Power Generation)
0.112 * 0.01 * 1.1 = 0.001232 MCr (1,232 Cr)

7c: Rate of Fire	We will select the highest possible rate of fire which
is 100 shots per 30 minute space combat turn.  This translates to a
ground combat ROF of 1/4 (1 shot every 4 combat turns)

7d: Power Input
ROF * IE = Megajoules consumed per 5 second turn.  Divide this number by
5 to find the MW of power that must be allocated to operate the weapon.
0.25 * 0.32 / 5 = 0.016 MW of power required.

We will generate the required power with Explosive Power Generators 

TL 14 Pulse Fusion Cartridge (PFC) 0.016 MJ

Vol = output * 0.0002
0.0002 * 0.016 = 0.0000032 cubic meters (3.2 cubic centimeters)
Cost (MCr) = output * 0.000008
0.016 * 0.000008 = 0.000000128 MCr (0.128 credits)
Mass Vol * 4
0.0000032 * 4 = 0.0000128 tons (0.0128 kg)(12.8 grams)
Cartridge Dimensions:
Radius 5.54mm
Diameter 11.08mm
Length 33.24mm

8 Gun Crew:	0.0000012 crew (rounds up to 1) required
We are going to skip the gunners (normal) workstation required by the
rules at this point.  Instead we are going to finish the design of this
meson gun using the rules for designing High Energy Weapons.

This is the _first & only_ way this design breaks the rules.

9 Meson Gun Carriage, Mount, Etc:

We will not give this gun a carriage.  The rules for High Energy Weapons
state that man portable weapons do not require a cradle.  The mass &
price of a stock are subsumed in the basic cost of a firing unit. 

Recoil System Weight
0.04* 2 = 0.08 kg

Feed System 
1  100 round box magazine w/ auto loader
 Empty Mass 0.799 kg
Cost 1 Cr
Full Mass 2.079 kg

Price (Credits)

Firing Unit		2000
Support Hardware 	2000
Inertial Compensator	1000
 (The actual recoil of this weapon (1) does not require it to have an
inertial compensator. I am giving it one anyway to represent my
perception of the stability a meson gun firing solution requires)
Meson Tunnel		12
Beam Pointer		1000
HPG			1232
100 Cartridges		13 	(0.128 * 100 = 12.8 Cr)
Magazine		1
Gun Shield		1

Total  Loaded Cost Cr 7,259

Total  Loaded Mass 
34.549 kg (76 lbs)

This design becomes much lighter at TL 16 & higher.  I suspect it might
be designable as a handgun by TL 20 or so.

In the campaign I played in where this weapon was introduced it was
described as TL 16 and given a cost (as an experimental secret weapon)
of about MCr 50 each.  It would probably be less imbalancing to a
campaign at this cost. 

I realize that this wepon is somewhat heavy for a man portable weapon,
but it would make a good squad level suport weapon.

Comment are welcommed.

The rules are that only the minimum change needed to explain away an 
inconsistency in the Traveller rules&background should be introduced.
Thus if a "heat sink" dimension with inescapable logic _dictated_ that
a corresponding "heat supply" dimension would exist, then my suggestion
would be unworkable (because such a dimension would mess up the
background much worse than the small hole it plugged). But I don\'t see
why such a dimension is inevitable. Plausible, yes, but no more than
that.

[In a similar vein, this "heat sink" is only necessary in space (since
its only purpose is to provide space vehicles with an otherwise non-
existent heat sink. The implication of the "minimum change" rule is that
this heat sink dimension would not be accessible on planets (Something to
do with the curvature of space, no doubt ;-).]

(And btw. I\'d like the answers to Paul\'s three questions too, please).

I can see how a military would accept such rules based on its own
prejudices, but the resulting logistical problems are so big (especially
if it isn\'t just one or two simple prejudices like sex and skin color)
that I can\'t see the Imperial militaries putting up with a multitude of
different prejudices like that. They\'d want to be able to shift people
around to suit their own needs without bothering about compatibility.
I suspect that they\'d have a short and painful way with anybody who
tried to practice (unaproved) prejudices. And anyone that came from a
culture so inflexible that they couldn\'t learn wouldn\'t be hired in
the first place.

In fact, the universal gender tolerance in Imperial society could well
be a product of the "culture" of the Imperial militaries.

Sure, there are plenty of genuine logistical problems. That\'s why I
don\'t think the Imperial militaries would put up with a lot of
artificial ones (And they\'d propably solve the genuine ones by just not
hiring people who are too fra from the Imperial norm).

It would be even better not to hire them in the first place. That way
you don\'t have to procure special rations for part of you troops.

Again, I think that the Imperium would let the recruit adjust to a
standard temperature during the first year. If her can\'t cut it, they
cut him.
 
Of course, there are some logistical problems you have to accept and
cater to. But you can bet that the militaries try to keep them down
to a minimum!

No. Stop and figure out the effective mass of the "belt". It\'d take
more mass than a gas giant. And they\'d attract each other until they\'d
either ejected most of the bodies from the belt, or formed into larger
bodies.


> If that case, do two near asteroid follow quite the same orbit?

Only if they are close enough to be orbiting each other. Otherwise it
takes only a small difference in orbital radius to amount to *days* of
difference in orbital period. So while they might be close together for
a while (part of one orbit) it\'d be a *long* time before they got
anywhere close again.

Nope, it still suffers the same problems the last one did. Only slightly less.

Marc, if you can hear me, could you please explain your reasoning for this
task system, as opposed to say, somthing similar to previous games sytem
(TNE, MT, other other known systems). Perhaps knowledge of it\'s fundamental
idea will enable me to use it in a better way.
I would like to use the system, but I need something to tell my players.

        I know the Big Task Thread is finished, but, just in case
anybody

interested, I am toying with an MT-like task system. The reason are my
personal tastes: I want to roll only 2D6, to use T4 character generation

T4/Emperor\'s Arsenal weapon stats. No real rationale for preferring this
to
other system, The probabilities are somewhat related to those of MT with
the
corrections I want to account for the extra skills, and I mixed it all
with
an immediate aplication for the combat/damage system which uses the T4
rules
to some extent, partiallyt incorporating the Max.3D damage in a way I
think
makes more sense. So,

The 3-Task System: An alternative Task and Combat System for T4
- - ----

One and only requisiste: Remember the multiples of three:
3,6,9,12,15,18,21

Tasks:
=====

        2D6+Skill+(Attribute/3) <= (Difficulty)

        (round fractions down)

        Maximum allowed DM: +10

(Quote ends)

Why do you have a Maximum allowed DM at all ?

        Formidable      15+

        Impossible      21+
        ----
(Quote ends)

How about Nearly Impossible 21+ and Impossible 24+  If you leave in the
maximum +10 DM then no charecter will ever be able to complete an
_Impossible_ task.  The grammarian part of me has always thought that
Impossible tasks should be _impossible_.

(Quote)
        Note: Average characters got a DM of +2 from a level-7
attribute,
which
explains Average being 9+.
        
        This system is very similar to MT, but designed for T4
characters
who have
a significatively larger number of skills. For most characters, Easy,
Average and Difficult are roughly equivalent to Easy, Routine and
Difficult
in MT. Formidable somewhere between Difficult and Formidable in MT,
Staggering somewhere betwwn Formidable and Impossible in MT.

        Spectacular Success: When the actual roll makes the next
difficulty level
(i.e. exceeds the required level by 3+). Example: Rolling 12+ in an
Average
task.

        Spectacular Failure: When the actual roll does NOT make the
previous
difficulty level (i.e. fails by 4+). Can give rise to a 2D mishap.
Example:
Not rolling 6+ in an Average task.

(Quote ends)

How about if a roll that does not make the second previous difficulty
level  (fails by 7+) adds 1d to the mishap table, a roll that does not
make the third previous difficulty level (fails by 10+ adds 2d to the
mishap table, etc.  This may be too lethal, but spectacular failures at
harder tasks should be worse as well as more frequent.  

(Quote)
        Marginal success: If the roll equals the required level exactly.
Example:
Rolling exactly 7 in an Average task.

        Fumble: An exact roll of 2 is always a failure, regardless of
DMs.
Can give
rise to a 3D mishap.

Mishap table (2D or 3D)

How about 4d mishaps ?

(Quote)

Combat System:
=============

        Use the T4 difficulty levels and weapon DMs for the to hit
tasks.
        For assessing damage, refer to the result of the task

        Fumble: Implement a 2D mishap.
        Spectacular Failure: Failed
        Failure: Failed
        Marginal Success: Only 1D damage from the attack is taken.
        Success: Normal T4 rules. Maximum 3D damage.
        Spectacular Success: No maximum damage, all the damage of the
weapon is taken.

(Quote ends)

Well then how is Spectacular Success any better than a regular Success
if you are using a weapon that only does 1 to 3 dice of dammage anyway
?  Otherwise this is good.

(Quote)

Variation: Record the Hit numbers from MT and substitute the dice of
damage
for hits. For the "1" damage points generated by the T4 system, record
each
three of them as a whole hit.

Suzette, I\'m very happy that you feel that way about pregnancy and etc.,
and I share those views as much as a male can. BUT, :) I have a number
of (female) friends who feel exactly opposite. So, I think that such a 
technology/state of mind could easily exist somewhere in the 3I. Think
_Brave New World_ and the society it exhibits. Sterility from birth 
[decanting] through geneering, and social engineering from decanting
to make the citizens think of giving birth the way we [generally] feel
about incest. I could easily see that in some of the stricter or religious
forms of government. I heard a lot about the "mother instinct" after the
Susan Smith episode when the comment that most came up in conversation
was "How could she do that to her own children?", but the recent thread
about the human Aslan tribes brought up the point of socially accepted/
ignored infanticide reported in some countries today. So I could see it
on a few Trav planets; IMHO a lot of what we call instinct is social
conditioning, to be tinkered w/ by government, Hiver, or GM as you 
prefer :)

I wouldn\'t get too carried away on that notion. I suspect that the hygene

Unless I\'m seriously mistaken momentum is conseved, not KE. Because KE is
proportional to V squared, and momentum to V only in exceptional

I was indeed talking about the FF&S tables, which I\'ve always presumed were
that way to because the gravitic focusing would need power. I\'ve always felt
that Grav focused lasers efficiency should vary depending on the focus
factor and the TL, rather than the fixed 20% efficiency in FF&S.

There isn\'t a lot of "garbage" in DNA, per se. There is a fair amount 
of evidence to suggest that the non-peptide encoding sequences are 
still important in terms of controlling transcription and expression 
of genes, as well as dictating the way the DNA binds to histones and 
is packed into chromosomes...while much of this "data" is peripheral 
to actually making the proteins, it provides an important context for 
it.

Hahahaha!  A new kind of info-terrorism: "Pay me the money or your
corporate records are gonna go on this trisket right here!"

Seriously (well, sort of), I talked to a guy from AT&T a few years ago who
said they were actively working on a form of 3D lattice memory that worked
by changing the configuration of a small protein that was easily made by
bacteria.  Illuminating a small spot with two or three lasers induced a
folding or unfolding, allowing you set and reset the bit essentially
forever, and very very fast too.  I don\'t know what state this research is
in now.

Brilliant Lances used a stupid somewhat vectorbased movement (I bet they

I used that for a while but had jumpdurations of:

encounter (I think its safe to say I\'m not giving anything away as a

  What I always liked about them was that they were described as
psionically targeted - you just decided what it was you wanted to
disappear, and it did.  This was clearly a plot device so that the troops
could disarm the players without killing them so the players could learn
something, but was still cool, I thought.  

  The Droyne were left over from the Ancients war, having been in storage,
so these pistols were Grandfather thingies.  Pretty Munchkin!!

Not.
KE is velocity (vector) times velocity (vector) which produces a scalar.
Mass is also a scalar so KE is a scalar. aren\'t you confusing KE with
momentum?
Momentum is velocity(vector) times mass(scalar) equals momentum(vector).

Well, I guess we could also bring up the October Crisis of 1970. If an
american president were to take away everyone\'s civil rights, there\'d be
civil war!

Aren\'t the Ine Givar in a sense, separatists? They\'re a Zhodani
"fifth-column" organization, right?

Maybe I should have stated that I lived in Toronto for two years under Bob
Rae\'s government, when the Quebec question was heating up.  Despite the
press\'s build up of the "culture clash", all the francophones I met in
Quebec were happy to help an English-speaker; the same cannot be said for
all the francophobes (!) I met in Ontario.  

Besides, it\'s _Mississippi_ that has all the Klansmen.

Have I offended everyone yet? :p

    'body' => 'One of the thing I like about the THUDDD contest is that it gets us thinking
about and working with the ship design system.  Here are a few things that I
noticed as a result of the April THUDD.

G Tanks: SSDS has G Tanks but does not say how to use them or for that matter
what they are. FF&S says that "G Tanks always compensate 1G and all
passengers crew in tanks are treated as strapped into a workstation (and so
use that column)".  The way I read this is that G Tanks are not any better
than being strapped into a workstation and therefore would be useless on
ships with workstations for its crew.  Some people think that G Tanks give an
addition 1G on top of every thing else and maybe this is what SSDS and FF&S2
should do.

Max Acceleration:  It seems that in QSDS there is no mention of acceleration
being limited by Grav Compensation.

Armor and Mass:  Mark Clark suggested he would like to have a ship whit an
Armor rating of 50 or so.  Unfortunately this completely ignores that well
armored hulls are really massive and should degrade the performance of your
maneuver drives.  My THUDDD design (which I did using QSDS and the redesigned
with FF&S) has only an armor rating of 20, ended up with a thrust to mass
ratio of 2:1 even though it was designed with 4G thrusters.  QSDS ignores
mass, but since QSDS also give you prebuilt hull this isn\'t a big problem
(well there are a few hulls which could be problems). SSDS on the other hand
only limits hulls based on cost and volume.  Neither of these are sufficient
to keep a ship from having an overly massive hull.  Now, SSDS has you keep
track of mass, but it does not do anything with this.  What seems to be
missing from SSDS is the part from FF&S that said that if a ship massed 15.5+
metric tons per displacement ton then a ship should recalculate its
acceleration based on mass instead of volume.

Laser ROF:  I would imagine that a laser with a ROF of 100 (1 shot ever 18
seconds) would be 10x more effective that a laser with an ROF of 10 (1 shot
ever 3 minutes) but calculating SSDS laser ratings resulting in only some
improvement in penetration (as if you are hitting the same spot repeatedly). 
This just doesn\'t make much sense to me but I don\'t have a suggestion on what
do instead, except maybe increasing the damage rating by 10.  This stuff was
probable debated on the GDW-Beta List but I don\'t recall.

And how many of them have kids?  Suzette\'s point is a valid one, shared by
an overwhelming majority of women who have had kids.  Having kids (the
actual carrying, birthing, nursing, etc.) is one of those life experiences
that puts your life on an entirely new vector that you just _cannot_
predict beforehand.  I\'ve seen this happen over and over in both men and
women who had protested otherwise previously.  It\'s one of the
wonderful/scary things about having kids!

Some things can be done better without technology than with.  (Hmmm... with
this subject and that statement, I can see us heading for "Barbarella" real
quick. :p )

	If we\'re going to take a challenge, let\'s not unnecessarily restrict it
from the beginning. Who says the best way to do a *simple, easy-to-play* 3D
vector game will still involve hexmaps? Yes, it works great for 2D games,
but maybe, maybe not for 3D. I don\'t know either way, personally, but let\'s
keep our options open. As long as it\'s simple...

Funny you should mention this. I was _just_ trying to find this in my own
Traveller books not two days ago! I\'ve got the players in my campaign
venturing into Tuglikki Sector, and I wanted to see if that was the sector
where the rosette was.

I think it\'s further trailing like in Windhorn or Provence. I\'ll let you
know if I find it!

Sorry, but if you are talking km-sized or bigger bodies at a range of a
few (1-5?) light seconds, forget it. A normal ship\'s radar *will* pick
them up. If it couldn\'t, it couldn\'t detect ships at the more normal

Actually, we never really get told much about *how* the drives work.
But note that the kludged-together spaceship in Cosmic Computer makes a
*very* strong point regarding the idea that "lift" (CG) and "drive"
(horizontal motion on the ground, vertical motion during "boost") are
two *seperate* systems. They even make a point about them working "in
line" with each other after they change the ship\'s orientation!

So however the "drive" part works, it *ain\'t* "pushing" on the
planet/star/whatever.

Visual stealth is easy. Think "flat black paint". While not too
practical with ships, it\'s a winner on missiles. So that limits the
usefulness of a telescope.

Most of a radar array isn\'t "fry-able". It\'s not until the signal gets
to the actual *detector* (as opposed to the focusing elements and
microwave "plumbing") that there\'s anything that will overload short of
a burst close enough to *melt* the surface of the hull. So it\'d likely
be good design to have the detector inside the hull where you can get
at it, and maybe even have an automatic swapping arrangement.

Trouble is, they blind *you* also, and in space, most of the output of
a nuke is in the x-ray range. In atmosphere, the bige fireball and
thermal flash (and shockwave) all come from the x-rays being absorbed
by the air, which then gets heated to incandescence. 

The x-ray flux is far more dangerous to your ship, and to your sensors.
It could also cause early detonation of *any* missiles within a certain
range, including the ones you are firing!

2. The engine is steam turbine , with coal as the fuel (I need to work

3. Armour. While the ship has twice the internal struture needed , it
still has no armour , as the density of wood in VDS is 1 per 1m^3, which
makes it redicolous to try to use it as armour.

4. All items inside are as per QSDS/SSDS. I will proberbly double the

5. Missiles. The only weapons are 36 missile batteries with NO GUIDENCE.
Broadsides at knife fighting range anyone???

6. I have not costed it, as it would be irrelevent to cos it for the
culture using Traveller costs. It would be like buying a 1750\'s

7. There is a lot of space here. I envision it to be used for cargo or
troop transport.

8. The crewing is a guestimation. I worked off 10 officers and 200

9. Endurence is for 300 hours. It can be more by sacrifising cargo space

	I mentioned this on an early post.  There are a few cultures where
sibling marriage is acceptable, but only among the highest echelons of the
ruling class.  It is still deemed illegal/reprehensible for anyone else in
theat culture (Pharoahs were divine, after all).

	I agree, age of consent is everything.  Among several tribes in
New Zealand, sex with younger men (age 12-15) by older adults (ages 20-30)
is acceptable, as long as it is ritualized and they are part of the same
"hunting fraternity" (bad term, but a close approxiamtion).  There, the
object was to keep virility amongst the men.

	By the universal taboo, it is appropriate to say that sex with
youn children (newborn to 8 years) is universally frowned upon by
societies.

Think of the colonial regiments in the last century.  

If you assume computerized book-keeping and accounting (run by Vilani
quartermasters) then the logistics shouldn\'t be a problem.  It would be no
different than having a species-specific regiment.  (Which I have in my

	Again, this was only aceptable because ROYALTY were involved.  The
ruling chelons have been/are exempt from a number of cultural laws and
mores... <g>.  The European houses involved close-cousin marriages, while
the Egyptians invloved sibling crosses (what better way to keep the power

	Yes.  There is an argument among some physical anthropologists
that incest is actually an advantages behaviour in small populations, as
it weeds out the lethal genes.

Hmmm...I was very careful NOT to imply Lamarkian genetics at all. There is
a passage in the article to the effect that the majority of their physical
differences are due to an entire life spent at low gee...if you use your
toes to grip things from an early age through to adulthood, you are going
to have well developed and agile toes. I know this...I have a friend who
can reach out and pinch like hell with her toes ;-) 

From what we know of short term exposure to zero gee conditions, I suspect
that physically there will be considerable differences due to lifelong
exposure. They DID have a period of horrible die-off, so the population
rebuilt itself from a fairly small population. 

Genetically they are probably no more different from Imperial humans that
Solomani are from Vilani, or Darrians, or Zhodani, all of whom have fairly
distinctive traits, since they are another of Grandfathers kids...

Their susceptibility to disease can be easily explained by their going to
a disease-free state before boarding the original ships, and their
subsequent lack of exposure over the next couple of millenia...actually it
would only take a generation or two before an isolated population would be
susceptible to a number of diseases.

The Forlorn are probably a relatively short lived group as a separate
\'species\'. The main imetus for their differences, that they were
travelling, essentially, in low gee generation ships, has been removed,
and they will probably be absorbed into Imperial society.

I suspect that another few generations along, unless they work at
maintaining a separate society, there will be Forlorn living throuought
the Imperium, distinguished only by names, a few odd holidays, and a
family history. The 27 will probably still exist as a dusty museum, and
there will be pockets of old Forlorn living here and there, following the
\'old\' ways. 

Sad in a way, though, I like them.

Speaking from my experience in a \'wet\' Navy, I would tend to disagree.
The design of a warship is based around it\'s payload (ie. the weapons it
carries), the delivery systems, the direct support systems and then the
secondary support systems.  It has to be balanced for offense and defense,
and crew considerations, while important, are secondary to this.  For
example, air conditioning.  For a ship operating in and around the
tropics, the interior of a ship can become stifling.  A/C is provided in
the sleeping areas, otherwise crew effeciency would plummit.  But if you
do not work in a space where the equipment (electronics or computers) or
the environment (engineering is literally unbearable without it, barely
tolerable with it) require A/C, you don\'t get it.

But that is how 60% of U.S. sailors do live.  And we have a very effective
force out there!  Retention is always a big concern, but the Navy is
consistantly able to attract trained or trainable recruits to fill the
need.  (tho\' it\'s not funt to be a recruiter!)

There are a thousand jobs that must be done at any given point of a trip
that are not detailed in the game.  Calibration and maintenance tests for
the electronics and computing systems of the weapons.  Physical
maintenance of the machinery that drives the weapons themselves.
Simulations to hone thier skills.  Gunners, like all crewmembers, WILL be
busy during jump.

Based on my experience, a rack is just someplace to sleep.  Given a choice
between having a cramped workspace (where I spend most of my time), and a
large room that I have to keep up, or a larger workspace and smaller
personal space - well, the workspace makes more sense.  It\'s tough
sometimes, but you adapt.

The argument for better trained crews that can handle their weapons more
effectively only looks good on paper.  Time and time again, battle
experience has almost always favored the side with the weight of fire on
thier side.  Don\'t get me wrong, training is important.  It\'s a vital part
of any modern Navy.  But battles have been lost because of logistic
issues, where critical elements had to withdraw because their ammunition
reserves were exhausted.  It was true when ships were powered by oars,
it\'s true now, and it will continue to be true as long as sapients feel
the need to blow each other up.

You can find mention of it _one_ place, as far as I remember, namely in the
Imperial Encyclopedia, Library Data, Ancients, p. 17:

"There is evidence they created the multiworld rosette at Tireen (Knaeleng
2910, in the Vargr extents)."

This is all.

Hope this helps.

You should check
http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Vault/4061/ancients.html there\'s a
system with a rosette described there. Though it doesn\'t say anything
more about it than that it\'s in the Knaeleng subsector.

Johnny Mnemonic.  Cool effect, but didn\'t seem plausible.

My questions are:
What element(s) would be used and how would the edge be attached? 
Carbon-carbon bond strengths look pretty promising.

Could the bond strengths be increased by applying an electrical current? 
If so, this could open the field to a lot of other elements.  This could
translate into a sort of light-saber effect.

What happens at the atomic level as the molecular edge contacts a
surface or is parried by another molecular edge?  Will it necessarily glide
through anything, or would it\'s cutting ability be dependent on the bond
strengths of the resisting surface?

This ties in nicely with the "siren call" of Andor and Candory we discussed
in the Templars thread..  Grandfather (or one of the kids) wants us to find
something, even to the point of instructing us through our DNA to look for it.

Yet for some reason we haven\'t found it yet.. maybe the Templars are hiding
the secret..

I love the story of the guy who was shot at point-blank range with a .45.
The slug deflected off his skull, burrowed under his skin around the head,
exiting to the rear.  Gunman saw a bloody hole in front and back, thought
his target was dead, and walked away.  The victim walked to the hospital.

The wide and weird varieties of what can happen in fire combat have turned
me off to so-called "ultra-realistic" combat systems.  If you try to model
everything, the game slows down to an unplayable crawl.

In my view, the Imperial Army is made up of regiments drawn from member
worlds.  A planet has its Planetary Defence Force, and the top 10% of the
combat units get Imperial training and equipment.  These assignments are
reviewed every decade or so, so the units that hold the coveted posistions
train hard to keep the edge.

Brigades and Divisions are assembled on an "as needed" basis.  During an
invasion of a Zhodani world, for example, the Commanding General might see a
nned for a Lift Infantry Division, and tag the 17th Caponi Dragoons (Lift
Infantry), the McCallen Rifles (Lift Infantry), and the 73rd Heavy Tank to
form the unit.

It would be the duty of the officers and NCOs to insure that everybody
"played nice."  Rivalry is one thing, but when it gets to the point of
threatening the safety of the units, it must be stopped.

If Imperial intervention is needed to quell an uprising on a member world, I
imagine that the Marines would be used first.  By their nature, they owe
allegience to the Emperor and the Fleet, and can be assured of acting
impartialy.  Using Army forces could led to long term resentmant aginst the
world that raised the regiment(s) involved.

Recruits from lo-pop worlds are probably out of luck.. for the Army they
probably travel to a neighbor world and enlist there.  Many kids from these
backwaters will enlist in the Navy or Marines just to get off the mudball
they grew up on.

You do this by emphasizing from day one that the starman/Marine/soldier is
no longer white or black or male or female, but a member of His Imperial
Majesty\'s Armed Service, and the people around you are your comrades.  The
stressful enviroment and enforced uniformity of Basic Training, coupled with
a definate plan of instilling pride in the unit, causes old bigoted beliefs
to fall away.

In my own experience, we had a guy nicknamed Opie (he looked just like Ron
Howard\'s character from the Andy Griffith Show), who was *shocked* when he
was the only trainee in our platoon who wanted to go to church.  It was
completely outside his experience that any civilised American would turn
down the chance to go to services.  You can imagine his reaction when he
found out that his bunkmate was a Muslim.

At first he refused to speak with us, shnning us as sinners.  After a few
weeks of very hard work, he began to see us not as Godless heathens, but as
fellow soldiers.

This will happen in the Imperium also.. Isolated, under pressure, and trying
to learn all they need to know, trainees won\'t have the time or energy to hate.

A simple discharge will sufice.

They probably wouldn\'t bother to enlist in the first place.  You\'d be amazed
at the number of flag-waving, "patriots" I encounter who never considered
military service for the simple reason that they let (insert group) in.

The Imperial Navy and Marines will be the "melting pot" for the Imperium,
with members drawn from all the 11,000 worlds.  *These* will be the
"Citizens of the Imperium".. those who\'ve risen above their provincial view
of themselves as Lunionites or Reginians.

Considering my first day in Basic Training (90F, 85% humidity at 0430), I
doubt the Imperium is going to lose much sleep over the discomfort of its\'
trainees.

	Ok. I just checked my old research papers...

	The first research project I was involved in was "Small
	high-velocity projectile\'s effect on living tissue", and
	I have seen more than enough shredded limbs. _Not_ a nice
	sight.

	Since humans are inhomogeneous unidentical mobile targets,
	it is very difficult to estimate how much damage a given
	projectile hit will cause. However, some estimates can be
	made by examining sufficiently large number of wounded
	persons.

	A direct bone hit with a bullet fired from a modern assault
	rifle will usually shatter the bone to shrapnel. In the case
	of a limb hit the resulting damage can be so severe that the
	limb cannot be saved, and must be amputated. However it is
	not very likely that the limb would be completely blown off,
	since skin, sinews and clothing may keep the limb attached
	to the body.

	The muzzle energy of a "modern assault rifle" is roughly:

	5.45x39mm (AK-74): ~1.5 kJ
	5.56x45mm (M16, G33): ~1.6 kJ
	7.62x39mm (AK-47, M92): ~2.3 - 2.6 kJ
	7.62x51mm (M14, G3): ~3 kJ

	Short-range hit with a shotgun (12 gauge, 70mm shell,
	number 4 buckshot) can rip off a limb, since most of the
	kinetic energy of pellets is transferred to the target,
	and multiple pellet hits will shred skin and clothing.

	The total kinetic energy of all pellets is around 2 kJ.

	(... and remember, do not do this at home!)

[Excellent and funny design discussion snipped]

Man, did this bring back memories!  In a Champions campaign way back when,
my character was a mad-scientist inventor type; my shtick was always
having new gizmos in every game, some of which worked, some of which
failed spectacularly.  It was a blast to role-play.

But his crowning achievement was the back-pack meson gun (borrowed from
Traveller\'s ship-sized MGs).  This was an incredibly powerful weapon, but
horrifyingly inaccurate -- in character, I was always promising that I\'d
fixed the latter problem. :)  It also took between one and three combat
rounds to warm up for a shot, during which time it made a loud and
distinctive warbling whine.  Thus, it was not all that useful a
weapon...but when I *did* decide to use it, the joy in having every foe
*and* friend in the battle suddenly go white with panic and dive for cover
was breathtaking. :)

Also, I installed a safety override (after a bad experience I\'m sure you
can all picture) that put the absolute closest possible blast point, even
given worst-case inaccuracy, at least 20 meters away from me.  Once people
figured this out, that first keening whine would cause everyone in the
battle -- again, friend and foe alike -- to run directly *toward* me at
top speed.  This again lessened the thing\'s utility, but was way amusing.

Anyway, sorry for the off-topicness...but perhaps something similar might
fit into a light-hearted Trav campaign somewhere.

That\'s my understanding of the issue.  Otherwise, as you point out,
g-tanks would be rather worthless.

QSDS hulls are rated by acceleration.  The hull itself incorporates both
structural bracing and grav compensation sufficient for the rated
acceleration level, along with life support, cargo doors, airlocks, and so
forth.

On your mass vs. acceleration issues (a forceful argument...?), it\'s
always been the case that tying acceleration to volume was a kludge, pure
and simple.  Unfortunately, tying acceleration to mass instead requires
iterative design approaches, and it\'s very difficult to hit a nice round
whole-number G rating the way we all like it.  QSDS sidesteps this issue
by providing only lightly-armored hulls; as you say, SSDS should require
the FF&S 15.5 tonne/dt check, and require iterative recalculation if it\'s
exceeded.  Otherwise SSDS can produce ludicrously agile heavily-armored
ships.

I recommend that you try the Traveller Web Ring.  There are two good place to
start, either Goran Damberg\'s "Traveller - the web pages"
(http://enterprise.hb.se/~goeran/traveller/) which is the first link in the
ring, or the Imperium Games page (http://www.imperiumgames.com).  As you make
you way around the Trav Web Ring you\'ll find dozens of other Traveller page,
many of these already have very good Traveller links lists.

\'Real\' Traveller is my main Sci-fi game love, as I\'m quite
a large chap, and the thought of tight corridors in
starships like in 2300 really gets me
claustrophobic...hence I bought it and gave it away!!!


Have been playing Traveller for 12 years (starting with
CT\'s LBB\'s) along with AD&D (had to do some gaming when
no-one was keen on playing traveller..ie the early army
days) and had plenty of time to study up on my MT.

Regularly gaming now with a group every Saturday eve using
William Connor\'s Psionic Knights series TD14-17, (well
actually that plot\'s long gone now..and its getting more
and more intriguing.)
I am quite happy with my MT rules for now, especially after
the work I put in fixing them, and as I always say..\'if it
ain\'t broke...don\'t fix it\'...so I probably use them \'til
my dying day.
My only gripe was, I don\'t like the Starship combat system,
so I generally  just \'wing it\' and roleplay the combat,
letting the characters use their skills to get them out of
situations...just like in the other parts of the game...

I have a lovely wife (and best friend), Dorothy, to whom I
have been married for 3 years..She is really understanding

	What would be the amount of power (joules) that

	the current density was 1MegaAmp/cm^2 ?

Other questions:
	1) Since the induction coils used to store current

	2) Storing current in the ring should be easy assuming

         current off the ring with the induction coil(s) how 
         do you limit and regulate the voltage without blowing

Back in London, Ontario, in the mid-1980\'s, some friends and I played a
number of strange scenarios, using the Traveller system. One of these, run
by a truly eccentric individual named Steve McDonald, took place in and
around Montreal in 1999. The player characters were nationalists who had
given up on the democratic path to a separate Quebec and had taken up arms.
(Please note that, popular American misconceptions to the contrary, in
reality, armed separatist groups such as the FLQ ceased to exist here in
Quebec \'way back in the early 1970\'s.)

We screamed in horror when Steve described the world of the near future:
disco had come back into style, and we (the revolutionaries) were modishly
decked out in polyester flares, afros, platform shoes and gold chains. I\'m
not sure which seemed more unlikely and bizarre - the renewal of armed
separatism or the revival of disco!

Little did we know...

	I\'m not, I\'m not... Actually, I won\'t.  While I disagree with
Pierre-Louis and think that I can quite easily convince the rest of the
list that I\'m right, I\'m sure very few of you would be interested :).

	Suffice to say that I agree whole-heartedly with Pierre-Louis that
studies have shown that on average Qu=E9becois society is very tolerant and
open.  They are quite correct, as I have in the course of 8 years of French
immersion, 10 years of living with my Qu=E9becoise GF and hanging around wit=
h
her family, and taking as many courses in French as possible in Law school.
It is a great place to live; the only downside is that the current
government is an ethnic nationalist party with policies that are IMHO
racist.  If only the PQ would stop treating anglos like
strangers/foreigners, this place would be darn near perfect.

	And I want to say that I was not trolling the list; if I wanted to
start a language-based flamewar, I wouldn\'t do it where I sleep; there\'s a
really good one been going on in soc.culture.quebec for ages...

	But enough; I promise to avoid this topic like it was a
Virus-infested frac-cee rock decorated with Foss art duking it out with

The Ancients were responsible for several major features within what is

is evidence they created the multi-world rosette at Tireen/Knaeleng in

battle) stand as evidence of their wars; most, however, are restricted
areas under investigation by the Empire and are not open to the public.

I\'ve always assumed that the Imperium doesn\'t have an Army per se, but
\'borrowed\' units from member planets as needed.

The Army boy would stay on their homeworld, and just be part of a smaller
army (and envy the equipment of bigger armies :). Just like on earth today.
I invisage there being quite a lot of \'lending\' and cross training of
troops between neighbour systems.

The Marines OTOH would be Imperial, with only small local Marine Forces
(attached to the System Defence naval force) beloning to the system.

Agreed. Something I\'d like to see are designs from TLs 8 to 11. There are a
lot of other spacefaring cultures out there besides the Third Imperium, and
there should be some designs for their ships. Besides, I think HEPlaR is a
more interesting technology than thrust plates.

I ask these questions because of development of my misjump theory, which
states that a certain gravity potential is *required* to exit jumpspace,
which means there *has to be* a (relatively) large gravity well nearby
after a misjump. I wish to know how difficult it would be to find the
rogue comet, planet, or whatever "dark matter" is around in the middle
of an empty hex.

I would have to disagree with your theory, tho\' it does tend to increase =
the odds of surviving the standard misjump.

It\'s always been my understanding that once the J-field decays to a =
certain degree, your ship propagates back into normal space.  The =
J-field also collapses (at least in my game) when the J-field encounters =
a stronger G-field.  The longer the jump, the stronger the J-field is, =
and the more powerful the G-field must be (which is why high jump ships =
can jump past systems without propagating out, but also why a black hole =
will drag a ship out of J-Space).  Towards the end of the jump, again =
the field decays to a degree - to the point where the gravity well at =
100 diameters will cause a ship to propagate out of jump.

(In game terms, this means that a ship jumping to a planet tends to come =
out at 100 diameters +/- 10%.  A ship jumping to empty space had best =
have a very, very good command crew if they need any kind of precision.)

The presence of a strong G-field during the shaping of the initial =
\'envelope\' - the shape, charge and intensity of your J-field is what =
gives J-vector and direction - will warp that field and cause misjump.=20

A misjump can be anything from early propagation (hopefully not TOO =
early) of the ship, a wild increase in field strength (Long jump), =
erratic vector (wild jump), catastrophic field decay (ship gone) or a =
combination of the above.

  Well, I meant for ships.  I assume missile usage inplies combat
and active sensor uses.  After all the missile must approach to
attack, but a ship can can your mission in a variety of ways.

  Yes, but you know when the EMP is going to hit your arrays - the
guidance units for the missiles don\'t.  And if a given energy density
is a hassle to your (x) cm thick hull, how much lower a density is
a threat to a thin-skinned (but how thin?) missile?

  Why is the output more dangerous to a ship at x range than a missile
at x range? The second point gets pretty abstract, as it then follows
that particle beams could possibly to used to induce massive fratricide
in the "PD overload" swarms.

I believe that all this says is that _Solomani_ who are established in
Solomani & Aslan as being more accustomed to tight quarters can handle
this level of crowding.  IIRC  Solomani & Aslan says that when designing
deck plans for Solomani crewed starships you may use about 25 % less

the staterooms / bunks difference but goes to show what Solomani culture

Imperial culture creates a need for a bit more personal space than _we_
are used to.  You might argue that the group centered Vilani culture
might create individuals who require less privacy & personal space but I
believe that it is the rigidity of Vilani culture which requires its
people to have more personal space.  They can\'t stand to deal with each
other all the time (& need privacy) because it is too much work getting
consensus _all_ the time.

Similarly as technologicaly increases peoples expectations of their
living standard increase.  I believe that this is _the_ primary reason
why the use of bunks for crew is discouraged.  The average TL 11-13
Imperial is going to expect better care & conditions than we TL 8 people
do in exactly the same way that we expect better care & conditions than
our TL 4 forebears did.  Part of these higher standards will include
more privacy & part will consist of the space required to keep them in
the high standards they expect.

In Traveller the size of the army a planet has decreases as its TL
increases.  While much of this decrese is no doubt due to the fact that
they need smaller militarys as each soldier is so effective & partially
due to the fact that military costs seem to increase faster than GDP
does I think that part of the reason is that at higher TL\'s the
population is more pampered and a lesser percentage of them are willing
to endure the low quality living conditions (their perception _not_
mine) that the military life will offer them.

Having kids is a drug. Whenever you get home to your kid you feel relaxed
and happy for no rational reason (endorphins) and not very focussed on your
job anymore. This could be viewed in some cultures as subversive and
counter productive and therefore forcing you to let society foster your
artificially grown kids. Scary and thus interesting to roleplay. maybe I\'ll

I have a few points I would like to make.

1. Fighters..
	This has been done to death, I know.. First you have to
consider the scales we are talkng about here. The modern 
supercarrier carries between 75 to 100 aircraft. Were a typical
Trav Carrier carries 300 to 500, 10 to 50 ton fighters. I was kinda 
thinking, that if scaled we up the tonnage (as has been discused) we
would see a marked increase in "lethality" of single fighters.
	Though,the ten ton fighters have a great number of uses. 
Fuzzy wuzzy still applies.

2. Military crew accomodations
	A bunk is a lot of room, not singly but in groups. Your
personal space is small, but the left over room adds up quikly. If 
you figure 3m^3 per crew person (I would have killed for this much
room when I was on sea duty) that leaves 11m^3 per person for 
common spaces. Lots of room. As for reacreational space it is where
you make it. (I\'ve already mentioned Aux con, how \'bouts 12 person
D&D game (and traveller on that trip) in a squadrons paint shop)
I do agree Zeros should have staterooms, Ensigns, Lt jgs, Lt, 
small staterooms or shared large staterooms (shared being the most
likely of the two) Lt cmdrs and above have their own staterooms
small or large depending how tight you are for space. Capts+ have 
their own Large stateroom and a office if there is room.
	As for one comment I\'ve seen and heard way too often is
that in surface ships you can go out on deck to see the sky. Nope
the line seemed to remeber is "get the hell back where you belong"
Being on deck is not the safes place to be, esp. a Flight deck.

3. Sexual preferance
	Huh? why is this a discussion? So what if Norris is gay?
Unless your campaign is very childish this does not matter
people are the same no matter their preferance... Except maybe if
you are Bi, then it is easier to get a date 8-).

4. Heresy (tasks using funny dice)
	I have been expermenting with a 2d10 system for about 4 
years now. Using CT 8+ as a base and stealing from there. (gurps,
hero and TNE mostly) Have been playing with a damage system
based on AHL and T4 pen values that seems to work on paper, we\'ll
she survives the smoke test.
	Since the horsemen have been taken, can I be the "Holder 
of the crooked dice of fate". (or some thing like that)

5. More ship stuff..
	To the brave young ladd who expressed  a desire for a
shrinking of the size of warships. Bravo, I have always thougt
that most trav ships of the line were way to big. But, given 
the CT 1 turret per 100 tons I can see how this happened. It\'s
not that I didn\'t like the smiling Pac-man of death Tigress,
or the Battlestar Plankwell. I think they both can be shrunk 
to something more reasonable. The 60 to 90 kton range. Maybe 
it is the fact that I have used the AHL as a battle ship in 
to many of my games..

6. Background
	Well, what can I say, as most of guessed I\'m a former
Boatswain\'s Mate (Deckape and proud of it). Received training
for the Brown water navy, so I was promptly sent to the carrier
fleet, miltary logic at its best. I also have 80% of a tech 
Theatre degree with a good start on a minor in astronomy (I
know weird). Currently, meaning the last 3 years or so, I have
been working Casino security. And working or a degree in Gaming
(Casino), Hey, I live in Nevada. Oh, not to mention my ongoing 
expermentation in genetics, 19 month old toddling son.. 8-)

By far the most Traveller like space combat game I\'ve ever seen (meaning
that it feels like what I envisioned large spca battles as way back in the
CT timeframe).
Brilliant Lances feels like Twilight2000 in space: lots of overly
complicated hitlocation/damage and no fun. Movement ripped off from SPI
DeltaVee instead of their own Mayday (maybe they\'d already sold
Triplanetary to Steve Jackson and were unable to use it at the time, in BR
designer notes the designer refuses to talk about why that particula stupid
system was used in BL)

Slag is a bit like Sky Galleons of mars and no space feeling at all (sorry
Greg), its cheap though. There was a series of games from Task Force games
that resembles it a lot (not the Trek ripoff, the other one).
I bought it, read it through and gave it to my daughter as a space combat
system for her TWERPS games (she\'s only 3 years old so she\'ll have to
settle for fairly simple RPGs).

Not neccessarily. The most important thing when designing systems is
throwing away any old rpg/wargame garbage that have accumulated for
historical reasons:
hit points, choice between called shots/random hitlocations etc and then
sit down as far from RPG books as possible and write down what you\'d want
to model in the system: split second actions AND lung lulls when nobody is
doing anything, fear of getting shot at ALWAYS affecting everybody
including PCs etc.
Then you design it from scratch without looking at older systems. My quest
for now is trying to come up with a double-blind-like system for two
players with personal combat. Any ideas?

The argument that women will choose not to carry when technology will
enable them not to is perhaps similar to the notion that people will stop
running when cars are invented (ever seen the New York marathon?).

"It take so much time and is so painful to run longer distances that it is
reasonable to assume that whenever cars are owned by everyone running will
be a dead artform." (and then Dr Lucas Pontifex climbed down from his
podium at the Solar Geographic Societys gathering, year 1889).

Actually the FF&S is written they would still be usefull at TL-8-9 where they
are the only option for compensating Gs.  But maybe G Tanks should just be
+1G at all Tech Levels.

Doh (slapping myself on the forehead), your right.  However, QSDS allows 6G
ships at TL-10 and up while using SSDS your limited to 3/2Gs
(accelerating/evading) for crews strapped into workstations at TL-10, 4/3Gs
at TL-11 and 5/4Gs at the Imperium\'s TL-12.

More importantly, the diamond structure may be rigid enough not to 
spontaneously restructure itself to a blunter ( = less surface area) 
shaped edge.  Most metals - AFAIK all metals - would do so, if not 
spontaneously then certainly if banged somewhat.  Which is not 
entirely happy for a sword blade.

\\begin{soapbox}
This atomic rearrangement to minimise surface to volume ratio is why 
I\'m extremely sceptical about nanotechnology in its more extreme 
manifestations.  Maybe if you kept things very cool, used heavy atoms 
to minimise quantum effects and kept foreign atoms well away you 
could put together a Babbage engine which worked OK, but molecular 
fabrication plants would be out of the question.

Micron or 0.1 micron scales, on the other hand, maybe not...
\\end{soapbox}

Diamond, of course, is somewhat brittle, but I think (metal-seeded?) 
diamond is probably your best bet for sword edges of this sort.

The sharper something is, the more easily it loses its edge (to 
become less sharp) and this would apply to molecular edges in 
particular, since the loss or displacement of one atom affects 
sharpness rather a lot.

Well, if you believe in bonded superdense matter (TL 14) then yes - 
and that stuff would make a very nasty sword.

Incidentally, since it requires power, how come there\'s never been a 
power requirement for hulls made of it in MT/T4?

Otherwise, probably not, IMHO.

The edge will cut through an awful lot, being slowed by accretion of 
atoms to its leading edge (decreasing its sharpness) and by the 
energy of the blow being converted to heat as it breaks the molecular 
bonds.  Even axes cutting along the grain of wood slow down 
eventually, although it\'s a lot more effective than cutting across 
it.  Conventional swords would be like cutting across the grain, 
supersharp ones like cutting along it.

Once it stops, however, there\'s a very real risk that the material 
will have bonded together again around it.  Molecular or fibrous 
materials like wood or kevlar and ceramics wouldn\'t (though the cut 
would be quite difficult to remove the sword from, since it would be 
the *exact* width of the sword) but a metal would form bonds to the 
sword as it stops!

It\'s like the way you can cut into a block of ice with a wire, stop 
pressing down on the wire, and find the ice has re-frozen around it.

What I\'m saying is that the sword would work spectacularly well - 
once.  Maybe more times if you don\'t have to cut through too much 
metal.  You might well do better to make a superdense sword, sharpen 
it, and concentrate on making people unhappy with it.

If two supersharp blades meet, they will almost certainly cut each 
other in two for a strong contact (like parrying cutlasses) or cut 
into each other and become entangled for a weak or glancing contact 
(fencing foils).

Also, the rather efficient conversion of sword\'s KE (which, 
ObThrusters, is scalar and not conserved) into cutting means that 
very little of it goes into slowing the target down.  So they (and 
their blow) just keep coming, in one piece or several...

Then any world with a starport has to be TL-10 or so. Ain\'t what happens.
It has to be *local* tech, otherwise the starport type wouldn\'t

In the CT Droyne module on page 5 it says that there is a 5 world

We need to know what *voltage* too. :-)

Seriously, there are *three* limits on superconductors:
1. max temp
2. max current density
3. max magnetic flux density

Since current flow generates a magnetic field, these are not
independent figures.

BTW, you are storing *energy* (joules), not power (watts).


Other problems are that the magnetic field causes the ring to try to
expand. So there\'s a limit based on the tensile strength of the ring,
and if you try encasing it in something, then the limit is the
*compressive* strength of the ring (as it\'ll be *pushing* against the
supports).

Don\'t count on that. Even *I* know enought to make simple firearms from
commonly available materials (sulfur for the black powder is the hard
part, and even *it* can be obtained in not so obvious ways). Some
friends can build modern weapons out of raw metal stock. And I know a
lot of folks that have weapons that don\'t officially exist. :-)

That\'s a consideration for Traveller players. Consider the ones who are
foolish enough to believe the law level restrictions and don\'t realize
that the local *criminal* element has weapons several levels above
those that are legal. :-)

To quote an old line... "It\'s *bad* news when you find that you\'ve

Actually, that doesn\'t sound half bad. It means that the "push on the
planet/star" drive is actually *usable*!

Since the time varies as (1/P)^(1/3), doubling the power drops the time
to about 25 hours, tripling drops to 22 hr, and quadrupling to 20.

But it does strike me as the sort of thing a merchant would use.
Especially given that it only takes 7 hours to get to 10 diameters.
This explains *why* jumping a bit early occurs. :-)

Not necessarily. Remember, we have examples of *real* societies where
men had sex with women to produse kids, and with other men for
pleasure/love (and some of the women doing likewise). 

So it could be that as long as you do your "Duty to the Race", what you
do for recreation is ignored. Heck, if you don\'t care about *which*
person of the opposite sex is paired with you for kids, you can add
more diversity to the gene pool than the types that insist on having
the same partner all the time!

More likely they\'d not distinuguish class on this, as they can tell
how they feel. So odds are strongly that it\'ll either be accepted (as
the feelings are the same as hetero ones), or they\'ll "help" you
correct your feelings (if they feel that homosexuality is wrong).

Given that they *do* go in for eugenics to at least a small extent, if
they approve of homsexuality, you\'d still be expected to have kids.

Two cases that I\'ve heard of from friends in the medical profession:

1. Guy is stopped at a stoplight, hears string of firecrackers, gets
headache (back of head) and reaches back to find that he is all bloody
back there. Someone had emptied the clip from a .25 auto into the back
of his head!

2. Guy tries to commit suicide by putting the barrel of a .45 auto
pistol into his mouth and pulling the trigger. Muscle spasms in his
finger empty the clip! He *survived*! Seems that it was pointed just
right and all the rounds went *between* the hempispheres of his brain.
Chewed things up around the edges and removed much of the back of his
skull (.32 would have likely bounced around inside....)

I\'d say that the first was a failure. The second was *definitely a
*SPECTACULAR* failure. :-)

And there are lots of cases of people dying from truly *trivial*
wounds. Like a shot in a limb, pretty minor. Except that it knocked
loose a small fat globule that got into a vien, thru the heart and
wound up lodging in a critical artery and killing them!

Luckily, vectors "decompose" into vectors in each dimension. This also
means that you can keep seperate track of a 2d vector and a 1d altitude
vector and get the same results. 

So, the "easiest" way is to use a Mayday type system, but include
altitude counters. So both the present and future positions have
altitude counters as well as ship counters.

Another method that I\'ve seen involves *two* 2d maps adjecent to each
other (squares or "staggered squares" would work best here). One is the
X-Y plane. The other is the X-Z plane. You have a counter on each map.
You have to think of the map as making a 90 degree bend in the space
between the two maps.

Note that * and 0 are *not* near each other even though they are close
on one map. Ditto for * and #. But @ and 0 are near each other on
*both* maps. The minimum distance between two points is at least the
*max* of the two distances from the two maps!

Note that the counters *have* to be in the same "row" on both maps. 

SPI used this in "BattleFleet Mars". That game also had a display of
the solar system that might be useful to copy for any systems that get
a lot of traffic in your games. Each planet has it\'s orbit marked as a
circle, and the circle is divided into one day chunks (numbered from 1
to whatever). So every day you move a counter one space on the orbit.
For traveller, you just note which day slot the planets (and moons?)
were in when the players were last there, and then move them the right
number of days the next time they visit. Lets you give them a "real"
system display! It won\'t work for noticeably eliptical orbits (I\'d love
the formulas to figure it for those!) but those aren\'t common.

As TL is high, is there still precious materials which cannot be created
from others? 

I explain : For centuries, many people dreamed to convert lead to gold. We
know that\'s possible today but the converting prcess is more expensive than
gold itself. In a higher TL, those conversion could be much cheaper. So
cheap that even diamond bottles would be as easy to create as glass bottles.

At high TL we have quite low price energy and quite easy to build small
article accelerator. But also the duclear dampers which controls strong
forces inside a nucleus. with all those technologies. do you think it\'s
possible it would be cheaper to convert a material from a near by atomic
number marterial than to extract it from the underground or asteroids.

Let\'s say something like that : Put a amount of metal in a hoven and heat
it to liquid state (or even gaz state why not?) then increase the atomic
number of the particles with a high energy particle acelerator. Then as you
reach the good rate of wanted material, filtrate it with a high speed
rotating filter (mass filtering) then put the result in room at good temp
and presure to have the wanted crystal shapes. The nucelar dampers
technology could help the mass increase by proton or neutron absorbsion.
Some electric and gravitic technologies could help crystal shaping stage.


So... do your characters drink wine in diamond glasses?

minded people might be able to answer...

1) Am I missing something, or in theory could you point a nuclear damper at
a ship\'s or vehicle\'s power plant and stop the power-generating reaction?
Ooops..Mr. Grav Tank\'s fusion plant has died - it falls like a rock. And
boarding ships would become routine...

...I don\'t want this to work this way, cause I think it\'ll screw up a lot
of things...but I\'m wondering if there is a "Scientific" reason why it
won\'t work...

2) Plasma Weapons. The $100,000 question - can plasma weapons be used in a
vacuum (ie space). In Emperor\'s Arsenal, some of the heavier weapons have
USPs (13-0-0-0, for example). While this weapon isn\'t a great weapon
(nothing beyound short range)...I think it could be useful for a few
things:

   a) Anti-fighter weaponry.
   b) Fighter weaponry...fighters with high speed can get close and use
these "can-openers" to wreak havoc on larger ships - not to start the
fighter thread again, but I think plasma weapons could give fighters a
better edge.
   c) Plasma torpedos - instead of giving a missile a detonation laser,
give it a one-shot plasma cannon. It won\'t do as much hits, but it will
drill through armor, and if NDs don\'t affect fusion plants, they won\'t
affect these babies.

Plasma weapons in space is something I want to work - here\'s why:
  a) It\'s quasi-canon - Classic and Mega Traveller had em - TNE removed
them.
  b) I think they\'d be very effective in close-in situations.
  c) I like variety - the more weapons, the better. I personally like to
give some of my races their "signature" weapons...weapons that becuase of
culture or technology, they use a lot (my Aslan don\'t like missiles, for
example...).

  Just wondering what people think...

Well, for the longest time I saw separatism as the resurgence of ethnic
nationalism in Canada and in that light, I didn\'t really like it. I have
no desire to live in the next Yugoslavia, Bosnia or Northern Ireland.
(Though at the same time, I really have no desire to live in Toronto
either, but it\'s a necessary evil - hating Toronto is another national
passtime. We\'re such bumpkins at heart).

True Canadian values prevailed (don\'t complain, lay low, keep quiet,
let\'s not fuss about it, etc) however, so we\'re more or less back to the same
point we\'ve always been at. (And didn\'t anybody notice the \'Montcalm\'
patrol cruiser? My next THUDDD design will be the \'Wolfe\' (Wolf?)
counter-insurgency vessel...)

OK, ObTrav:

There\'s probably a lot of regionalism/nationalism in ther Imperium. Hell,
that was the whole basis of MegaTraveller - the splintering of the Imperium
into its component cultures. M0 must be very much the opposite - a lot
of diverse cultures/groups coming together, for the glory of the almighty
god of ECONOMICS, into the Third Imperium.

There will no doubt be some friction going on along the way...

The best I ever heard of was a guy who got shot in the foot with a .22 and

That\'s pretty racist, it suggests she doesn\'t know any anglophones 
because she doesn\'t associate with them. That kind of crap has left 3000+ 
people dead in Northern Ireland, where I live, and in other places in the 
world that deserve even more attention, millions dead.

I can\'t comment too much on the Quebecois/Qubecker situation exect to 
recount this:

My brother was on a holiday in Canada, and crossed over to Quebec from 
Ontario. He popped into a garage to get some munchies, and was refused 
service by the attendant, who muttered something in French to him. He 
then tried in French - and got insulted by the attendant - <In English>
- - for insulting his language. My Brother left the station - a guest in 
your land - with a very bad impression of it.

	Roderick: Good enough. :)  But I still don\'t think the PQ is
racist.
 
 
	Now, if anyone WANTS to create a Solomani faction named \'Les
Quebecois\' I\'d be happy to help. :)  I\'d do something like a
progressive, high-tech society who has a strong attachment to the
land (either the one of its origin or some planet somewhere), who
takes great pride in its own culture and ways of doing things (we
tend to boo and hiss and american TV, but heck, we watch it anyways
:) and I guess who entertains strong relations with the Aslans, who
probably consider the \'Quebecois\' to be very honorable, but a bit
wimpy when it comes to actual battle... :)
 
	I guess it wouldn\'t be too hard to see why the Solomani Party
would be displeased with this group.  On the other hand, a true
\'terrorist group\' or \'militia\' is hard to imagine here.  There have
been only 2 or 3 real terrorist acts in the last 50 years and they\'re
usually the work of small groups of 2 or 3 people.
 
	Preferred methods of \'terrorism\' would be Computer Hacking,
Propaganda (Celine Dion clones, anyone? :), or probably small
independant devices (killer bots at the most extreme).  There are
very few true fanatics here - but there are idiots everywhere, right?
So I guess suicide raids would be out of the question.
 
	Note that currently Quebec has NO army per se - all we have
are reserve units and special units.  It might be different if you
create a society that is independent of the Solomani Party.
 
	Not that leaves motives:  The main one would be
\'independance\', which basically mean that the group would like to
rule over its own land, planet, or such.  Freedom to pass their own
laws, taxation, protect their own culture, etc. Usually the group
resorts to democratic, political means to reach their goals,
sometimes economical levers, but very rarely violent means.
 
	So... Let\'s think up a scenario real quick... (note that this
is all improvised and any resemblance to real life is pure
coincidence :)  Say the group has heard of a wonderful opportunity to
aquire land on a wet planet.   The player characters could be some
agents sent to sell hydroelectricity contracts in exchange for the
land where the hydro centrals will be installed or whatever.  Of
course the poor natives might need some convincing... But can you
believe ALL their coal mines have collapsed recently, causing a major
power crisis?
 
	I hope someone finds this useful... and that I haven\'t hurt
any other Quebecois\' feelings :)

It likely won\'t, since the damper is not a beam weapon but an energy field

The MT Plasma Guns and thier cousins, the Fusion Guns are short range. I
believe only a max range of somewhere around 750,000 km, which for MT combat
is 3 squares (I may have one to many zeroes, but my MT books are not handy
at the moment). My military vessles use them as short range defensive
batteries, suplimenting the repulsors, and leaving the heavy work to bayed
Meson Guns, PA\'s, and Missiles (and disintegrators at higher tech levels).

   Fact: It\'s a scalar.  Even if it was a vector, it would not be
   conserved; just redo your own example using 2 m/s instead of 1 m/s
   for the velocity if you don\'t believe me. Kinetic energy is not
   conserved.  Kinetic energy is not conserved. Kinetic energy is not
   conserved.

   You are thinking of momentum, not KE.

   The total momentum is constant; the total KE is not. In fact, it is
   impossible to solve for a general reaction between two masses in
   which both momentum and KE is conserved, unless the two masses are
   relativistic, massless particles.

   A constant power drive, which does not use thrusters, but which
   pushes off a large "stationary" mass like a planet, has infinite
   acceleration at start. For power P and mass M, we get

   	distance: d = sqrt(2P/M) (2/3) t^(3/2)
   	speed: v = sqrt(2P/M) t^(1/2)
   	accleration: a = sqrt(P/M) / t^(1/2)

   which yields infinite acceleration at time t=0. Vehicles with
   constant power which push against the earth (like, say, automobiles)
   get around this problem of initial jolt (which can destroy an engine)
   by using a transaxle to moderate the power reaching the pushing
   mechanism (ie, the wheels).  A good starship pilot will thus have to
   be careful about "working the clutch" when he first takes off, or he
   might kill the engine.

   Obviously, such a drive is a far cry from what MM conceived when he
   first introduced his constant acceleration drives.

Not really.  Fuzzy wuzzy implies that while a given attacker is less
armored and less able to project force, if they get a shot/hit in,
your better armed troops are just as dead.  Fighters in traveller
can\'t hurt the big ships, so it doesn\'t apply (IMO).

Actually, traveller ships are rather smaller than I had imagined
them at an earlier point in my life.  Most player sized "ships" are
actually the size of aircraft.

I made some models (1:5000) of traveller ships an they are smaller
than I thought.  Besdies, I like huge ships :-)

Snippage of material synthesis technologies

Likely, yes, but also likely is that _natural_ gemstones will retain value
as gemstones. We see this today. It is readily possible to make synthetic
rubies, emeralds and sapphires of virtually any size, of high clarity, at
relatively little cost.

Natural gemstones of thise types, however, still retain high values. Why?
The perception of rarity and value. If it weren\'t for the DeBeer\'s
stranglehold on the diamond market, diamonds would be considerably cheaper
than they are today, since they are quite a bit more common than good gem
quality rubies, sapphires, and emeralds. Gemstones are still prized,
essentially, as objects d\'art, and nothing more. Synthetics are rapidly
taking over their roles as industrial materials.

Part of this is due to the craftsmans input into shaping , cutting, and
mounting the stones, but a very real part of their value comes from their
status as natural stones, I have seen this in action at the Tucson gem and
Mineral show (2nd largest such show in the world, millions of dollars of
transactions take place all over.) I have walked into a cheap motel room,
and seen large suitcases FILLED with cut stones lying open on the bed. A
heady sight, indeed.

But to drag it back on topic, I have seen large boules of synthetic
emerald, ruby, etc., and stones cut from them. Todays sysnthetic
techniques make perfect stones...and that\'s what gives them away. All
natural gemstones have small inclusions, imperfections that mark them as
natural, and are extremely hard or impossible to counterfeit.

Also lesser gem-like materials, such as turquoise, malachite, and opals
also command extremely high prices for quality stones, and are MUCH harder
to synthesize, due to their complex nature.

Gold will probably be of much less value as a \'precious metal\' than as an
vital industrial material..

However, the uncomfortable admixture of (essentially) unlimited power, and
fine control over the nucler forces is one of those singularity
events...beyond these things introduction society, warps beyond our
current comprehension, and so some handwaving (nay, an entire hiver
symphony of handwaving!) has to be done to make the Traveller universe not
have these things, like many, many of the other technologies we\'ve
discussed. If you have the ability to make any quantity of any material
you want, many of the assumptions we make about technology, economics, and
society start going way out of canon.

I think that this doesn\'t take into account the draft, though. If they 3I can
"pick and choose" troops that fit the Imp culture, they might not feel a
draft were necessary because they are certainly enough opportunities
for a non-militarily incline player to choose a civilian career, and there
would certainly be enough munchkins <g> wanting to play w/ the 
"real guns" so that the "draft if your recruitment roll fails" doesn\'t seem
to be necessary. 

Or do you think that this might be yet another use for the "survival
roll"? Not only might it stand for an injury, but it could be the 
character being discharged for simply not fitting the Imperial mold
for tolerance. I like the sound of this, but I think it could only apply
to the first term, as your comments suggest they wouldn\'t give you
very long to fit in.

Or do you think that might just be included in the enlistment roll in the
first place? They run the background check, see that your beliefs or
environmental demands aren\'t close enough to standard, and refuse to
take you. Would this cause resentment against the Imperium for that
home planet ("Not good enough for their precious navy, are we?")
Would that cause problems w/ other planets and the more dovish
members who say "How come they can get out of their patriotic
duty, but you take our sons and daughters off to die?"

Personally, I like the idea of "local" units myself (the 14302nd Imperial
Marines of Vesta "The Wombats of Doom"), but this is a neat idea
to kick around, too.

I proposed once before that maybe the hdimension is like the jdimension in 
that one can only use it past 100 diameters (something about that 100 dia-
meter limit that doesn\'t like dimensional bubbles and helps explain why
we haven\'t found jdrives and magic heat sinks yet). This won\'t help the heat
problem for when you\'re close to a planet, but it helps tie the hdimension into
what is known about the canon universe, and prevents planetary perpetual
motion machine power plants (PPMMPP) <g>.

	What Mr. Parizeau "really" meant is NOT a well know fact.  There
is plenty of evidence to posit that his comments about "minority votes"
were reported correctly.  Same thing about his "comments" on
women ( that white Quebecois women were not having enough children, and
thus being "outbred" by immigrants, who of course vote differently).
Also, Quebec has its own immigration officials and centers, and the
process of entering and gaining citizenship in the provence is quite
different from the rest of Canada.  They are a bastion of provincial
support, not "federalist powers"...

	I won\'t touch this one... :)  Your comments about linguistic
segregation is accurate, although which "side" is militant about it is
open to debate.

Well, first off you have to understand that I translated that from
the french.  M. Bouchard\'s mom (he\'s our prime minister) certainly did
not mean it to be racist... It is quite possible for her to have never
MET an anglophone!  For myself, I\'ve lived in a region that has a lot
of anglophones, one of the highest % in Quebec, and the first time someone
spoke to me in english here, I was 19 years old!!!!  

It\'s not because you stare at a martian that you\'re a racist... It might
just be because you\'ve never seen one before.

    'body' => 'Hi,

Given all the recent request for an improved experience system, here is
the one I am currently using:-

In order to improve a skill from 1 level to another, the player spends a
number of \'Development\' points, then rolls a number of dice below aiming
to get lower than or equal to the number of points spent.  The number of
dice rolled are equal to twice the new skill level (i.e. from 0 to 1
roll 2 dice, from 1 to 2 roll 4 dice etc...).  Irrespective of result
spent experience points are lost.

To match a similar development timescale as character generation, 4 to 6
\'development\' points should be awarded per awarded per adventure.

This works well with KB v2.0, in that a success instead of raising the
skill level it increases the \'experience level\' by one (the number of
dice based on the next higher skill level in a similar manner to
normal).  Since there are 3 experience levels per skill level 12 to 18
\'development\' points should be awarded per adventure.

I find that this has a number of advantages over the standard experience
system in that it:-

a) Matches the character generation rate of aquiring skills.
b) Makes it hard for characters to develop into hulking skill 8
monsters.
c) Follows a similar process to task resolution (roll dice lower than a
target number)

There is one disadvantage (which I personaly don\'t mind) is that at
higher skill levels large numbers of dice are required.

Any comments.

Chris.

   During WWII, Sten SMGs where being produced in high school metal shops.

   How corruptable is parts of the Police Force is also a factor.  This 
is were that streetwise skill comes into play. :-)  Studies in the US
have shown that in cities with very high law levels (& very high crime

	Can I suggest a very regressive society whose economy is almost entirely

although they take great pride in their own culture, no one ever pays any

Design Notes
I never thought that the SDB as presented in the TNE rulebook was any
good, so I decided to make up my own version. I used SSDS, with FFS
additions.  It used Heplar to allow TNE fans to use it, and it also
keeps the cost down.  Thruster plates would have added another 100 MCr
to the price.  The Griffen uses the 15 ton rule of thumb in FFS.  If a
ship weighs less than 15 tons per displacment ton, it can use the
10tons of thrust per displacment ton rule.  I had to sacrifice some
armor and weaponry to keep this legal. The write up will assume a
Reformation Coaltion campaign, but if change the names to Sylea or
something else, you can use the ship in a Milieu 0 campaign.

The price from SSDS is 376.184 MCr, while the FFS price is 417.9822.
(SSDS gets a 10% price discount.)

The Griffen has significant more firepower than the TNE SDB.  It is
also over three times the price.  The main cost comes from the improved
sensors. If you assume that SDBs will only be found inside of Gas
Giants or planetary oceans, linked into a huge sensor net, the poor
sensors of the TNE SDB can be justified.  I thought the Griffen should
be capable of performing a wider range of missions.  The other
increased cost is the extra MFDs to control the large number of
missiles.  There are some tradeoffs in the design.  The Griffen has
less armor than the TNE SDB, it also has less fuel available for the Heplar.  

Write up:
The Griffen SDB was developed by Standard Astronics as a replacment for
the Dragon class of SDBs.  It was thought that the Dragons were unable
to fully protect the system against maruders.  The Griffen is upgunned,
it has additional, more powerful laser turrets and an additional
missile barbette.  It also has an improved sensor suite.  The Dragon
was designed for coordinated operation with a planetary sensor net. 
The Griffen was built for this, but also for independent operation.  It
also has room for 10 marines, without forcing the rest of the crew to hot bunk. 

The Griffen was built as a interceptor.  If hostile forces appeared in
system, but didn\'t assualt the gas giant, then most of the stationary
defenses would be useless.  The Griffen is capable of taking up station
in deep space and waiting for an enemy to appear.  It often does this
near system jump in spots.  Merchants are told to jump into a certain
volume of space. The SDBs can patrol this volume easier than if
merchants come in where ever they want.  Of course Pirates know where
the Merchants will jump into also, but that is what the SDBs are for.  

The inside of the ship is bright and clean.  There is a fair bit of
room for the crew to operate.  There are extra staterooms, either for
ship\'s troops or to give the crew more room.  The Aubani navy places a
premium on the morale of its sailors.  To help with this, the ship has
an excellent mess.  The ship is too small to carry a full time steward,
but the gunners are used as cooking staff.  The other enlisted crew on
the ship are required to peform kp duty several times a week.  This is
the only way a small ship, can still have freshly cooked meals.  The
other option would be to have several tons of frozen diners in the
cargo bay.  Faced with this option the crew cheerfully pitches in.  
There are also several state of the art entertainment centers for the
crew to relax with.  There is an extensive library of holovids for the
crew to watch.  The crew is also offered incentives to take self paced
computer taught courses.  These courses can be any subject which
intrests the sailor.  Many sailors use these courses to get a start on
a college degree, for a life after the service.  To remind the sailors
of home, there is a large (9m^3) terrarium in the main crew lounge. 
This makes the ship a little less sterile, and also helps out the life
support systems by producing some fresh oxygen.

The ship is a streamlined wedge, and looks much like the standard SDB,
but it has more exterior surface features such as sensors and weapon
turrets.  Twenty percent of the surface is covered with fuel scoops.

    'from' => 'Eris Reddoch',
    'body' => 'I see sensors as having 3 basic parts:

1.  The Receiver sub-system picks up signals (of whatever sort). This is
all hardware.  There is little an operator can do to *directly* improve
this function.

2.  The Processor sub-system tries to pull information out of the signal
noise by filtering, changing frequencies or focus of the sensor arrays,
etc.  This is mostly computerized, but an operator should be able to apply
intelligence and experience to improve this function.

3.  The Controller sub-system evaluates the information about
targets trying to identify each target and priorities potential threats. 
This *can* be done by AI software, but here a skilled operator should have
a very positive effect.

My question is just how much effect?  

How much improvement is there in detection range when a skilled sensor
operator is in the loop?

Let\'s use the following example for our discussion:

Passive sensor system that, on *Automatic*, is able to detect some
standardized object at 900,000 km....say 30 hexes.

A Professional Skill leveled Sensor Operator with an average
Attribute.  Let\'s say: T4   Skill 3, Attribute 7
                       KB2  Skill 9, Attribute 7

How much effect, if any, does our operator have on detection range?

None?

A few hexes?

Double the range?

More than that?


My initial reaction is to say:  Skill + Attribute + Automatic Range, giving
a range of 40(T4) or 46(KB2).  This seems like a *large* increase, but
maybe it should be large.

Let\'s look at a possible example:

================================================================
ISS Ajax

Passive Sensor Basic Range: 30      Operator: 16    Enhanced: 46 Size:     
- -8
Stealth:    4
EMM:        8
================================================================

ZSS Jove

Passive Sensor Basic Range: 30      Operator: 10    Enhanced: 40 Size:     
- -8
Stealth:    4
EMM:        8
================================================================

1.  Ajax is 40 hexes from Jove, conducting a Passive Sensor Scan with her
sensor operator working the controls. Ajax is not using EMM.

2.  Jove is 40 hexes from Ajax, conducting *Automatic* Passive Sensor Scan,
no sensor operator working the controls.  Jove is not using EMM.

Task 1
Ajax to detect Jove.  Average Task (3d)
(Ajax Enhanced Sensors) - (Range - Jove_Size + Jove_Stealth)

    Actual numbers: (46) - (40-8+4) = 10 <-- 50% chance of success
    
Task 2
Jove to detect Jove.  Average Task (3d)
(Jove Basic Sensors) - (Range - Ajax_Size + Ajax_Stealth)

    Actual numbers: (30) - (40-8+4) = -6 <-- no chance of success

Depends on the version of Traveller you are playing.  TNE list them as
requiring their very own beam pointer to aim them at incoming
missiles.  T4 list them as components mounted in turrets or batteries.
Both versions indicate that nuclear dampers must be aimed.

I hated the depiction of the mono-whip in Johnny Mnemonic.  The only
reason it glowed was to give the audience something to follow.  Yuck.

Know what a Buckley Ball is?  Take the two hemispheres and separate
them with multiple rings until the "ball" has stretched into a long
string (a Buckley Tube).

Bonding mono-wire to the leading edge of an edged weapon also asks the
question: What are you bonding it *with*?  I don\'t think you can bond
it on a molecular level, since doing so would alter the molecular
structure of the Buckley Tube.

The light-sabre idea works well if you base it on the idea of the
Variable Sword from Ringworld.  Take a spool of mono-wire with a tiny
(5mm) bright red ball at one end and a handle or grip at the other.
Now wrap the whole thing in a small stasis field.  You can flicker the
field to let out more wire to increase the length of the "blade".  The
stasis field is basically skin-tight over the surface of the mono-wire
(and 5mm ball), making the stasis field only slightly larger in
diameter (it doesn\'t glow, however).

The only problem is that you can\'t stab with it to pierce anything
that a 5mm point (driven by typical human strength) would normally
penetrate.

Such a weapon would be extremely light, with 99.9% of its mass in the
handle or pummel.  Using one would not be as intuitive as picking up a
baseball bat (it would be like aiming a garden hose/nozzle-- without
the mass of the hose).  The 5mm ball on Ringworld\'s Variable Sword was
designed to be iridescent to make it easier for the eye to follow when
cutting down trees 30 metres away.

But the "heat dimension" bubble *does* interact with the "jump bubble"
on a 3D level-- since both bubbles originate within 3D space.  Since
the idea of both bubbles is to isolate the /3D world/ from either
dimension, they cannot help but interact at the /3D level/.

A jump drive converts H2 into some form of energy (probably
electrical) that is dumped to the hull grid.  So far, this energy
still exists in the Real World(tm) and must abide by our rules.  The
handwaving doesn\'t start until /after/ this point.

To maintain your comparison between "j-dimension" and "h-dimension",
your waste heat must be converted into energy before it is dumped to
the heat sink "thingy" (remember, we are still in the Real World(tm)
at this point, and must abide by those rules).  Real World(tm) physics
also state that transforming heat energy into another form is *highly*
inefficient... this is where things get ugly.

That does "cover the bases", but since I cannot enter this world to
interact with it and examine other facts, it becomes impossible to
disprove such a theory (which is what I thought Hans was asking).

1) I can\'t answer this one, since my mathematical background is-- by
now-- "weak" at best.

2) One breaks the laws of conservation of energy, which can open up a
whole new can of worms (ie: a fictitious universe is most stable if
handwaving is kept to a minimum).  Solar cells also absorb heat energy
from the local light source, which must be dealt with in some way.

3) The Star Trigger was a one-off thingy obtained beyond TL15.  It has
only had to have been dealt with once in the Traveller universe.
Conversely, allowing such a device at TL10 so that early spacegoers
can get rid of that heat build-up that has been handwaved away could
cause problems (ie: technology is usually developed first as a weapon,
since control isn\'t as great an issue-- like fission).  Perhaps a few
TLs down the road, the Darrians will figure out a way to make the Star
Trigger small enough to act as a gateway for unwanted heat aboard a
starship (*if* Star Triggers are based upon said technology).

I actually like the idea of a heat sink dimension, but began to work
on the "against" side after Hans asked someone to try and disprove his
idea.  I\'d like to be on the "for" side, but I think we need some more
input so that the use of a dimensional heat sink won\'t be abused.
Since you propose to base it on a principle similar to jump space, a
bit of handwaving can\'t really hurt (being built on the foundations of
previous canonical handwaving :)

DEXTERITY
Tester holds a 12" ruler a few inches above subject\'s hand. Drop the ruler
three times in between the subject\'s fingers for the subject to catch.
Record the result each time, then ignore the highest and lowest number for
the subject\'s Dexterity.  Subtract this number from 15.  The result is the
subjects DEX.

Did you notice that the gun cost less than Cr 7,500 as well.  So not
only would this thing be able to shoot through walls & buildings but it
would be cheap enough for individuals to own (on TL 15 Law Level 0
worlds of course).  How about the National Meson Gun Man Portable 
Association to lobby to keep these things legal.

Only about 6 months or so.  Most all of the snow is gone & we might see

gotten as high as 50 degreees (10 degrees C) judgind by the number of
people wearing shorts I\'ve seen.  :)

Warships are going to be more spartan than civilian ships, and with the
emphasis on volume rather than mass I\'d guess quarters will be *quite*
spartan.  However, I still think *more* volume needs to be set aside for
crew than the rules indicate.  On civilian ships I think there should be
quite a bit more space allocated.

Having said that, I *don\'t* think this extra space should..or
would..be put into sleeping areas.

Think about it, just how much awake time does the average person spend in
their bedroom?  I think that crew aboard starship, like crew aboard
seaships, won\'t rush to their quarters after duty and *stay* there until
their next duty cycle begins..well unless they just have time to sleep. 
That might not be to uncommon either, because as a retired USN Captain told
me one time "an idle sailor is a danger to himself, his crewmates, and his
ship."  The USN\'s prescription is "drill \'em till they drop." <g>

When they *do* get free time where will they be?  In communal areas, like
wardrooms, mess halls, and the equivalent of 10 Forward.  They will also be
in recreation areas, like gyms, weightrooms, pools, workshops, gamerooms
and more realistic equivalent of holosuites. Being alone doesn\'t build the
kind of esprit-de-corps..crew
consiousness that most organizations prize, so I\'d think significant
amounts of "alone time" would be socially and officially disapproved.

Sure, everybody needs *some* alone time, and if their bunking areas are, at
least, semi-private that will do.  Put thin movable
partitions between bunks, have comfortable bunks that can double as
lounges/chairs, include simple entertainment access, noise suppression, and
efficient use of space for storage, and a fresher for every 3 or 4 "bunks",
and use all the saved space for the
communal and recreational areas.

Passengers, Military Officers, and the crew of civilian ships will want,
expect, and get larger accommodations.  Larger accommodations might mean
2.5x2.5m private rooms with shared freshers.  Higher level officers and
First Class passengers might get 4x2.5m with an included fresher.  On
warships, the CO isn\'t expected to hob-nob with the ratings, so she will
probably be allocated more private space, but not *much* more.

Is this the sort of life you or I would seek out?  Don\'t know about you,
but *I* wouldn\'t..that\'s one reason I stayed out of the service, too.  <g>
OTHO, could I put up with it for a few weeks passage from Actarus to
Capella Prime?  Yep! Where do I book passage?

Military *and* civilian ships are going to allocate more common area space

If you have Vilani and Vargr, page 65 explains the hidden pocket universe 
at Lair which contains the rosette. Apparently a gas giant called 
Fyutinyu by the Ancients was rotated out of normal space along with 7 of 
its moons. They ignited the gas giant. The pocket universe is connected 
to our universe through a number of portals, located on and around Lair

Even now, the portals are occasionally used by the inhabitants of the 
Fyutinyu universe and their robotic servants....

Glenn Hoppe asked:
> But is 3 armour all the way around enough for interplanetary travel?

I\'d say ... definitely not.  There\'s two major dangers that you need to
protect the ship and passengers from in deep space: micrometeors and
radiation.  For an interplanetary vessel (that\'s designed to spend the vast
majority of it\'s working lifetime in orbital or deep space), the chance that
a radiation event or a big enough micrometeor will come along is pretty much
a certainty.  So an interplanetary ship needs to carry enough armor to
survive that.

> Back in Feb. wildstar posted an armour conversion table which listed
> QSDS Armour value 0 as being equivalent to a T4 Armour value of 13.

Right; the value may get fiddled with in the next revision of QSDS, but
it\'ll still be in the 10-15 ballpark.  It turns out that 13 is a
particularly bad breakpoint for some things.

> CSC stated that an armour of 3 is required for the front and 2 for other
> sides in order to get a sub-orbital "certification".

Right.  That\'s sub-orbital, not interplanetary.  The assumption is that
suborbital vehicles spend most of their time below orbital speeds and
altitudes - reducing the chance of a major incident to the point where the
risk is considered acceptable (but for the devious referees out there: it\'s
not zero - take one out to orbit, and you run a very slight risk of hitting
something that\'ll damage the craft, or taking enough radiation to be
dangerous to the occupants or the electronics).

> Question: Is 13 the minimum armour required for inteplanetary travel
> when using the VDS? If not (i\'m guessing it is, or perhaps rounded to
> 10) then what is the minimum?

In general, the VDS isn\'t for building interplanetary vehicles.  If you want
to go interplanetary, use serious armor (10 or above) to protect the vehicle
and the occupants.  You\'re guessing right, in other words.

I feel compelled to point out that there is evidence that the opposite is
true, at least for  Roman Egypt. A specific example of a census from AD 173-4
lists a family of four brothers (occupation unknown) all living in the same
house (inherited from their parents), two of whom having married their
sisters. They do not seem to from" the highest echelons of thruling class",
although they do seem to be property owners and members of the rural elite.
This is not a specialty of mine, but there seems to be a substantial body of
evidence for sibling unions, although they seem to have been forbidden to
Roman citizens.

That does change the soup a bit...

I\'ll theorise then...

Since the obgect of a defensive damper is to prevent an explosive nuclear
reaction, then directing them at vehicles would perhaps do little more than
slow them down a bit.

However, that does not prevent a specialised damper from being developed to
stop power plant nuclear cores.

    One possible configuration:

    10m wide    33 ft
     7m high    23 ft

    This is a two story building!

     10.5m high     35 ft

    This is a *three* story building!  It\'s also the size of a small
    tramp freighter.

This isn\'t really a PC ship, but let\'s look at it just because it\'s the

it!) ;->

    138m long   453 ft
     24m wide    79 ft

I agree.  And it\'s the same reason that starship battles on big and little
screens get fought at ranges of a few km -- the audience wants to be able
to see both ships at once.  Sigh.

Not "Buckley," "Bucky."  Short for Buckminster Fuller, inventor of the
geodesic dome (among other things), which is structurally identical to
C60.

Not a problem, really.  People routinely synthesize buckythings with
"handles" on them these days.

Depends on where in Quebec you are. In Montreal, I have found it to be very 
open-minded and cosmipolitan (I have both separatists and federalists as friends)
I have been told by others that Quebec City is hell on earth for anglos.
Idiocy crosses all languages, cultures and races.
I remember watching european news when Quebec was having their last referendum and 
the feeling I got from it was "what is wrong with these people, they live in a peaceful 
culture that treats them more than fairly"

That\'s "Buckyball" and "Buckytube."  They\'re named after Buckminster Fuller,
nicknamed "Bucky," inventor of the geodesic dome.  (I don\'t ordinarily correct

[Much SNIPped, including ASCII_art showing two 2D maps]

Leonard, I must not get out much because that was one of the best TML posts
I have read. The paired X-Y and X-Z maps are a brilliant idea. Thanks, I\'ll
look for "BattleFleet Mars".

I think an X-Y hex map and a rectangular X-Z map would work perfectly. I
prefer hex maps because there is a finer granularity of facings and no
awkward diagonals to deal with. A rectangular X-Z map is fine because, as
you point out, one only has to deal with the Z vector. Also, on a planet
one can\'t (drastically) change your Z coordinate so the same rules and map
could be used for planetary combat by eliminating the X-Z map. This is
good. I like it. Is there any way to encourage IG to use this idea?

    For what it\'s worth, I seem to recall that in the original
short-story, the mono-whip did not glow, and, in fact, they couldn\'t see
it.  The narrative rewound and played the scene in slo-mo in order to
explain what had happened.  I remember it as a great visual moment in the
story and was extremely disappointed that it wasn\'t carried through in the
movie, but then just about everything in that movie was a huge
disappointment.  William Gibson lost a lot of my respect for writing that
screenplay (although he got some of it back with _Idoru_, his best work in
a long time, I thought).

Anyway, carry on.

	Ahhh... Jean Cretien is the *Prime Minister* of Canada.  I think
you mean *premier* of Quebec when referring to Bouchard.  Quebec IS stil
part of Canada....

	Some sibling unions were seen in Roman-occupied Alexandria as
well.  Not only were they against Roman law, but there seems to have been
local pressure against it as well (from Szilagyi (1963)).  This is a bit
earlier than your example, though.  These sib crosses were seen solely
among the local elite.  At least, that is what has been reported... :)

	There were a number of cases seen in Greek-occupied Egypt (as
reported by Ascadi and Nemeskeri (1972)).  You are quite correct about it
being seen beyond the ruling courts, although in a limited frequency.  It
seems to have been limited to those with some higher status, and even then
it was viewed in a different light by the rest of society.

	Marvin Harris gets into this stuff.  I think he also cited some
examples from India (pre- AD 500).  I am more interested in
paleodemographics rather than incest <g>.

No, it doesn\'t.  I don\'t really have a problem with this, either.  It
is just a creative use of a device outside of its normal role.  It
will only work for fission powerplants, however.  Fusion operates on a
different principle.

Two different things here. making gold from lead will *always* require
lots of energy. But making diamond from carbon isn\'t inheremt all that
energy intensive. 

Right now they can "diamond plate" things. Trouble is, it doesn\'t work
well with metals, you tend to wind up with a carbide layer instead.

Unlikely. Converting is always going to be more expensive than
extracting. But consider the fact that a 1 km nickel iron asteroid will
"only" have around a million tons of gold in it....

With fusion power you can seperate matter at the *isotope* level. So
it\'s not just diamond bottles, but pure carbon-12 diamond, at that.

Diamond *will* be pretty cheap at high tech levels. Partly because
advanced semiconductors will be doped *carbon* (diamond) rather than
doped silicon. So there will be large amounts of "spoiled" diamond
available (wrong resistivity, crystal defects, etc). I know. I worked
in a place that made silicon ingots and silicon wafers from the ingots.
Anybody who wanted it could have multi-kilo chunks of defective ingot
for paperweights. Since diamond is "pretty", there will be more of a
market for it (our scrap silicon got sold for use in steel making).

In any case, Traveller *way* undersestimates the availability of
elements at their tech levels. You just turn rock into plasma, then
sort the atoms by atomic weight using magnetic fields (a sort of
overgrown mass spectrograph). 

So raw elements will cost based on their abundance in the universe.
What will be expensive will be *arrangements* of atoms. Specific
crystal structures, especially gemstones, complex composite materials,
etc. 

"Simple" crystals like sapphire, ruby, and diamond won\'t be worth much
unless they are "natural". I picture miners using some sort of scanning
gear on the rock to see if there is anything worth digging out by hand
before feeding the rock to the crusher and then to the fusion torch for
seperation into elements.

PC\'s one high passenger for this run is a slightly eccentric inventor; who
has this \'loud and distinctive warbling whine\' intermittently comming from
his cabin as he \'tinkers\' with his latest invention.

Perhaps a few spectacular but not immediately lethal detonations having the
engineering crew frantically tracking random \'short ciricuts\'.

But don\'t you realize that they are only advocating a feudal technocracy
to cover up the Templar plots which are secretly part of the epic
conflict between the Hivers & the Ancients (who are secretly still
around & whose secret mind control is driving everyone towards the Five
Sisters/Spinward Marches subsector).

No.  Never keep units where their loyalty to the locals would be greater
than their loyalty to the government. Tiaenamem Square was a stand off until
troops from a DIFFERENT ETHNIC region than the protesters were brought in.
Even Imperial Rome knew this: legions were raised in one area and stationed
somewhere else. Also why fraternization is discourged. When trouble starts,
you do not want the troops expected to suppress it to have any cause for
hesitation.

	Actually, IIRC from earlier versions of Traveller (all the way back to the
IBBB and Striker), a "nuclear damper" was able to project a field which
could both damp (i.e. inhibit) nuclear reactions, or enhance (i.e.
accelerate them). So not only can you prevent the enemy\'s missiles from
going off, you can detonate them prematurely.

	Likewise, I see no major problem with allowing the use of NDs on another
form of nuclear bomb, the fusion reactor. Damping the nuclear force will
reduce the power output, while enhancing it will increase it. In fact, I
expect TL12+ fusion reactors to USE damping technology to control the reactor.

	As far as its use as a weapon, I believe NDs have always been fairly
short-ranged. Also, damping a nuclear warhead before it begins a high-rate
thermonuclear reaction may be easier than damping an ongoing reaction. And
if your target already uses ND tech to control the reactor, his NDs are
much closer than yours, and hence have a great advantage.

	Actually, I can see spacestations, etc. having short-range NDs mounted
inside docking bays or around docking areas. Next time your PCs threaten to
warm up their power plant and fire ship\'s weapons at recalcitrant
bureaucrats (mine have a couple of times), have the ship\'s engineer
suddenly come on the intercom "Capt\'n! I canna get the pow\'r ye need! She\'s
damped oot!"

	But for boarding I\'d rule you need to be fairly close, and have a very
strong one. NDs sized for warheads would probably have trouble coping with
a warship-sized fusion plant, but your average small fighter, OTOH ... <duck>

I\'m sure I read a Harry Harrison book about a racist nutter who gets his 
hands on a time machine and then proceeds to travel back in time to the 
civil war and starts making Sten Guns to try and help the south win. 
On problem with the sten gun though is that it is rather prone to jamming 
as it is essentially an improvised weapon.

Exactly right.  The CSC designs were rough drafts, so to speak.  It was a
bear reverse engineering the explosives, but worth it.

If you like, you can use the CSC stats as varients.

Hmmm...true. Yeah, I can see that they must interact. I was trying to get
away from the unfortunate "hole" terminology that suggested it was an
actual breech in the j-bubble. So perhaps my suggestion that it shares
certain properties w/ the j-dimension (e.g. 100-diameter limit) is more
important for its validity.

So the heat energy itself cannot be used? It must be converted into 
another form? (Y\'all will have to help me out here, what little physics
I\'ve had was a *long* time ago) *sigh* So does this mean we now 
have to fall back on radiating the heat into the dimension instead of
using it as a barrier against it?

Ok, I see that. But I don\'t think we\'re asking you to do the impossible, 
merely the nearly impossible and help us to minimize the handwaving 
on this sucka  :)

But is there any real difference in game terms between the two? I know 
that the cells require the solar input to function conserving energy, but
in game terms that might as well be perpetual and thus "money for nothing".
That\'s why I\'d love to determine what the effeciency/power ratings on
these things might be.

The solar cell disadvantage of dealing w/ the waste heat has its equal
in the heat sink disadvantage of going kablooie if the pplant dies while
it is on. I think that works pretty good for game balance :)

Hmmm...so if we\'re breaking conservation...maybe we can bring thrusters
into this as well...and thus tie the j-dimension, h-dimension, and t-dimension
together. Great Scott, man! We\'re on the verge of finding the "Unified 
Hand-Wave Theory"!!!!      :)

Well, if we use the 100-diameter limitation, this problem goes away for 
the most part.

That\'s what we\'re all out here kicking the tires for.

Just some general comments here. Hangars I think is essential for
fulfilling the patrol crusiers mission. You need at least a small
ships boat so that troops can be dispatched for toll and other 
checking missions. These are situations where you maybe don\'t know
the ship you are about to check, so you don\'t want to take the
patrol crusier to close and lose your manuverbility. I also think 
meson screens are essential since these ships are to undertake 
stand alone missions. Since there is a meson gun bay and small meson
screens are relative cheap I would preferee the patrol cruiser to
have this. But when it comes to small staterooms vs. bunks I go for the
bunks. These are military ships, no luxary liners. The crew sleep in the
bunks and all other available free space serves as common areas. I would
rather use bunks and throw in a couple of large staterooms for crew common
areas than go for small staterooms where some of the space is used for
this purpose.

Well, my QSDS design did fairly well, although I used a modified FF&S
designed hull. The proplem with QSDS is that the laser batteries uses 
tremendous amounts of power. The SSDS ships fit 4 powerful lasers and
use a 750Mw power plant. The Torden had puny weapons but used over 400Mw
on lasers alone. I think this is something we have to look into before the
next THUDDD.

Well this is my design and I thought I would comment some on the design.
First of, thanks for your comments and praise.

Well my first comment is about the manuever drive. Bertlings philosophy
(and mine) is that we don\'t like the Thruster Plates, they have been
booted out of my campaign. I therefor use the HEPlaR drive which cost 
tremendously in power and fuel. The hole design therefor becomes a
tradeoff in volume (something I think is the main point of designing
ships). This is also the reason for the bunks. The HEPlaR drive also 
cuts down on usable manuver time. The Torden only has 20G-hours of fuel
(more if jump fuel is used) and therefor can only beform five hours of
full thrust before being sitting duck. (This makes space combat much
more enjoyable). 

The armored hull on this ship was made with the FF&S but I really needed
a better hull than the ones in QSDS. I have not given the hull a 25% 
discount so on this one I agree with you. I also see the arguments Chris
Cox has made about mass to thrust ratio, but if I am to make ships at all
this has to go out the window.

The low power lasers (uses over 400Mw) is a result of what QSDS has to
offer. Lasers in QSDS is a power sink compared to SSDS and therefor really
a result of design system. The lack of dampers and sandcasters is also a 
result of the problem with power and volume. Since the ship has a 50 armor
value and a 4G drive my thoughts was that if things get though run. The
armor should protect the ship until the ship can escape. 

Thanks again for your comments.

Yes, but the locals will compete for the additional money, equipment and
training that comes from being a designated "Imperial" unit.  Much like the
scramble to be part of the RDF back in the early 1980s, commanders will see
the chance to greatly improve their units and enhance their careers.

The Imperium isn\'t going to need a TL9 horde.. it would be massacred against
a modern foe.  However, a portion of that horde trained and equipped to TL13
makes for an effective force.

The Imperial, and planetary, Armies are a defensive force.  They exist to
deny the enemy occupation of their homeworld.  To that end, you\'ll see
wheeled/tracked vehicles even at the higher TLs (they\'re cheaper to build.)

Consider that from the end of the Pacification Campaigns (200-ish), the
Imperium has been involved in *one* war of conquest (The Solomani Rim War,
990-1002 IIRC.)  The Navy and Marines provide more than enough offensive
punch for a defence-orientated Imperium.

VERY low-pop worlds (pop 4 or less) would probably have arangements to
either send their recruits to a regiment on a nearby world, or form a
regiment composed of other low-pop systems.  It did occur to me that these
types of recruits are the ones who will be more likely to join the Navy or
Marines.. having had more than enough of life on the farm, they\'re ready to
see the universe!

>The Marines OTOH would be Imperial, with only small local Marine Forces
>(attached to the System Defence naval force) beloning to the system.

The way I see it, For every Navy Fleet, there will be three Marine Regiments
attached.  These Regiments will cycle through a three year rotation of duties:

Year one:  Training/Garrison.  The regiment provides security detachments
for Imperila Consulates and Naval facilities in their subsector.  Various
Honor Guard and ceremonial functions are also performed.  Marines are
detached for special schooling or short term assignments.

Year two: Fleet Patrol.  The regiment is boarded, either as Ship\'s Troops,
or on Rico-class Company Drop Ships.  Elements of the regiment carry out the
directives of the Subsector command.  Small unit training is carried out on
a continual basis.

Year three:  Regimental Training.  The regiment is consolidated at a central
point, and trains as a unit.  The regiment is also on alert to provide
immediate support wherever needed.

Note that a new Marine will see each of these tours in his first term.

Once again you run into the problem that if you can see it, it can see you.
Your 90 ton gunboat is going up against a 90,000 ton BB.. it has many, many
sensors and weapons.  It can devote a number of them to destroying these
gunboats before they can do much damage.

If a 90 ton ship is carrying a 50 ton bay, it\'s not going to do much else,
is it?  One hit that knocks out your bay or fire control, and that ship
becomes worthless.  Indeed, how many salvos can you fire from a bay, anyway?

"After he ejects"???  This fighter jock is closing on a BB like a bat out of
hell.. where do you think *he\'s* going after he punches out?  He\'ll still
have the the same velocity as the fighter, changed however slightly by the
act of ejecting, but still...

Kamikaze attacks worked because WWII vessels had everything exposed.  The
weapons, the crew, everything was vulnerable.  On a T4 ship, what do you
think the fire control officer is going to do when the computer reports an
enemy small craft on collision course?  He\'s going to vaporize it; and if
you have filled your ship with explosives, so much the better.

Same difference with the destroyer.  Either the capital ships blast it out
of space, or they all turn their neclear dampers on it, and then dodge as
the now-harmless ship races by.  BTW: Never bet on remote control in combat.
Jamming and EMP effects are more than likely to cut your control at the
worst possible moment.

The time factor.  It\'ll be hours from jump emergence to impact.  Also,
nothing in space is stationary, that\'s why we need astrogators.  Everything
is moving relative to everything else.  Send an unmanned missle through, and
there\'s a good chance it will sail by its\' target.

Of course if you got it up to a decent percentage of light speed, you
could.. AIIIEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!(thud)(bludgeon)

TNE canonically establishes that nuclear dampers can be used to damp out
the fusion plants of nearby ships in The Guilded Lily adventure.  In the
adventure the owner of a starhip repair facility, Jo\'s Garage, realizes
that the ship she\'s been working on is a vampire & she shuts it down.
"Jo\'s father, Pablo, installed a powerful damper projector in the garage
and focussed it on the maintenance bay as a means of preventing people
from hijacking ships or just trying to skip out on a bill.  When turned
on, it will immediately shut down any ships fusion plant."

No stats or TL for this damper projector are given, although the map
shows its size as less than 3m x 3m.

This is a fairly good adventure & I reccommend it.  The interior art is
_terrible_ but it is otherwise quite good.  One of the better touches in
this adventure is that every single inhabitant of the planet Berens
(C846136-8 population 41) is described.  This adventure could fit in a
Milleau 0 setting or even be fit into a Milleau 1100 one. Unfortunately
it is the first of a planned 3 adventures the other two of which were
never done.

Nice and simple, and reasonable results.  How about translating this to a
scale/process similar to KB2?  I\'d like to tie the results to *more* than
the weapons DV, though.  There should be a little variability based on
creature size, strength, constitution..not *too* much for humanoids though.

I would also give som criterias before I start.
   - The ship should have at least J2, and I think J3 is a
     little unnessesery.
   - Ships with 4G gets a pluss. 5G and 6G is to much and to
     expencive in mony, power and volume. 1G-3G is not enough
     to meet the design specs in my eyes.
   - Should have sandcasters, nuclear dampers and meson screens
     together with a 30+ armor rating (I know this is not available
     with QSDS but I still think the patrol cruiser needs it :-)
   - Should have fire power all the way to the extreme range.
   - Should carry missiles.
   - There is a need for a ships boat (20dton+) and at least 4 troops
     for custom checks of vessels. The need for the small craft is 
     so the main vessel can keep som distance should the ship turn 
     out to be smuggling and fires.

Well here goes.

This ship has a little to low maneuver drive, should be 4Gs.
I\'m not sure the 3J is needed and maybe this should be dropped
to 2J and more defensive armament put in. Like the large

facilities. High price and overly large cargo space. Also 
lacks troops.

I design that is really inovative. Like the mission bays and the high
armor. But this design is really not what I see as a patrol cruiser.
The high G-rating is an overkill. Not enough offensive or defensive
capabilities. And still it has a very high cost. Also lacks hangar
space.

Nice cost, maybe a little to small a vessel. Nice offensive
weaponry. But thats the good points. To low a maneuver drive,
low armor and poor defesive capabilities. To small a hangar,
no troops, and a very high crew for such a small ship.
Maybe one of the lasers should go, to make room for a meson screen
or more maneuver capabilites.

Another to small a vessel for my taste. Lacks offensive
power (a QSDS flaw). Good armor but lacks the supirior 
defesive capabilities. Needs a nuclear damper. Lacks 
hangar and troops so no costum checks available. 
I really don\'t see this ship performing as a patrol
cruiser. maybe a large scout, but then it also lacks
a refining plant for wilderness fueling.

Extremly high crew for such a vessel. What do they all do?
The fighter carried is great but I think the main ship should
have more fire power to assist the fighters and soften up the 
enemy. There is also a lack of defensive supiriority as the 
design specs called for, but better than some of the others.
Nice cost, nice armor and great auxilery craft facilities.

This is a ship I somewhat like. Good solid offensive weaponry.
Good maneuver capabilities. Good defensive armament, do it lacks
the nuclear dampers. Great sensor suits. The QSDS thingy strikes
again on the armor which needless to say is to low.
The hangar facilites should be a little larger to allow for 
costum checks. But overall a fair, solid design.

A nice and thought through design. Good offensive weapons
and a solid maneuver capability. Lacks the supirior defensive
armament the design specs called for. The ship needs a couple
of nuclear dampers and a better armor (a QSDS thing).
The cost is great but there is a very high crew cost involved
in this ship. The extra craft is good although I\'m not sure
I would have gone with the gig. Includes troops which is a pluss.

This would have been a great design if it didn\'t fall through
on the defensive side. Only two sandcasters is a little low
together with a 20 armor rating (again a QSDS flaw). Very 
good offensive capabilities although the choice of a bay is
a unusual one. The hangar facilities and troops are as called
for in a customs situation. The cost is good for such a capable
vessel. Nice work.

A very good design which only has a few flaws. The armor is a 
little low (a QSDS flaw), and the lack of a hangar and troops.
Aside from this this is a great vessel for patrol missions.
Nice work!

This ship is in my eyes broken. Sorry. The weapons use way
to low power. To get this good an offensive kick and only 
have 750 Mw of power must be wrong. I also would loose
a couple of sandcasters for a meson screen and a few nuclear
dampers. Again this is a ship that lacks a hangar and troops.

This is a very good design and I am a fan of Chris\' work.
Good offensive kick. Nice defensive armament, again QSDS
ruin somewhat because of the armor. Lacks the hangar and
troops. Also a very pricy ship. As with the mercenary
cruiser I think this ship maybe is a class above the 
patrol cruiser, Chris. But very nice work (especially the
3D-picture).

Well, I\'m not sure i dislike this ship as much as Mr. Clark.
There is a great many things missing on this ship. Needed
to make room for the offensive weaponry no doubt. This is
not a patrol cruiser but more a system defense boat, 
designed to lay dormant until a threat comes along and BOOM.
It fires moves and fires.

Again I see a vessel that borders on the patrol cruiser 
class. I see this ship more as a close escort classed ship.
Poor weaponry, poor manueverbility, but great defensive
arament. Especially the 60 armor rating is good. Misses
a hangar and troops for costum checks. The crew and cost 
is also almost outrageous.

few comments:
	I am not sure what use the light laser turrets are intended for.  
Their low penetration means that they cannot do real damage to most 
military ships, even fighters.  The fact that they are described as not 
capable of being controlled locally means that they are also not very 
good for missile defense since the 2 MFDs devoted to them means only two 
missiles could be targeted.  Though I suppose the missile MFDs could be 
redeployed to control laser turrets.  
	Only 3 missile barbettes are installed, with a total of 15 ready 
missiles, but 5 missile MFDs are available.  Only 4 MFDs are necessary to 
control 15 missiles, so what is the extra for?
	On the subject of local control, you state that there is no local 
control for the turrets, but all the turrets you use, as far as I can 
tell, are standard turrets which include workstations.  If you do not 
want to have workstations in your turrets then you have more room 
available to up the power or ROF of those turrets.
	You have 28 crew but only 25 workstations.  Are the other 
workstations in the turrets, or are you carrying extra crew?
	I agree that the Griffen is a real improvement over the Dragon, 
but I have a few suggestions for the Griffen mark II. :-)
	Replace the 4 light lasers with two heavy lasers and 2 of the 1 
ton PD lasers the design for which I\'ve emailed you before.  This will 
give your lasers an offensive punch and simultaneously improve your 
anti-missile defense all while only costing you 2 tons!  If you want, you 
can take out the workstation, and each laser and MFD is only .5 tons.  Of 
course, you still need to add the bridge stations for the MFDs.	
	Replace the 3 missile barbettes with one or two custom missile
bays.  This will increase you salvo size from 15 to 20, so as to take
advantage of all 5 missile MFDs.  It will also give you easy access to
your missile reloads if you put them all in reload cradles.  As it stands,
manually reloading the barbettes takes 1 hour, so the Griffen cannot fire
an immediate follow-up salvo.  This change takes up only a little more
space but greatly improves the Griffens offensive capabilities.

Pro-South Group of South African equip Lee\'s army with AK-74 and Lots of

Troops walking in line into the kill zone from a AK-74 is going to be very

Nothing I\'ve read about the 3rd Imperium has ever talked about the Army
except in a local (planetary) context. I\'ve assumed from this that they
were local forces, as we know that they exist, and are often quite large.
After all the Imperium only owned the space between planets not the worlds
themselves, and thus didn\'t need an Army - if they wan\'t to put down an
insurrection all they had to do was blockade the system until the revolt
collaspsed. During the Rebellion this changed, but even then it would\'ve
been easier to simply use existing forces from a friendly high population
world.

Note that in the later Roman Empire soldier were no longer posted outside
their homeland, partly because it gave them a more personal reason to
fight, and partly because it was cheaper. I note that at the time of the
rebellion the Domian capitals had thier own elite Marine forces and
dedicated Ducal guards (not surprising in a feudal state). This sugests to
me that by the 1110\'s most Imperial service personnel, even in the
frontline fleets, weren\'t being posted outside their own sector. The
personnel in the subsector and reserve fleets probaly didn\'t move out of
their own subsectors until the Rebellion started. This policy, orginally
introduced for cost-cutting reasons, allied with the greater autonomy of
Domains and sectors made the Rebellion/Second Civil War/Final War
Inevitable, IMHO.

It\'s ironic that the decenralization of power, introduced after the 1st
Civil War to aviod the piss-poor performance that percipitated the Civil
War, made the next one inevitable.

Ah!  I see we have a difference in definition here.  To me a fighter is 10
to 40 tons, and next to worthless against capital ships.  Once you get up
to 60+ tons you are into Boats! ;->

Against small warships of the Frigite and Destroyer class your missile
boats have a good chance.  Against Crusier and larger classes you\'d have a
*problem*...but so would any small warships.

Frankly, I don\'t see the advantage of 80-90 ton Boats over better armed and
armored 200-400 ton Boats, though.  There won\'t be a big difference in
price and there *will* be a big difference in performance.

Yes, but it will most likely be ballistic long before it reaches it\'s
target.  Fairly easy to avoid.

Wouldn\'t help any with hitting the target and not much with damage. A 10-20
ton mass at 6g is a pretty big bang all by its lonesome.

Assuming you can:  1. keep it under *power* all the way to your target
while the enemy fleet blows it\'s drives away; 2. keep it under *control* at
long range and with the enemy fleet blowing it\'s radio recievers away; and
3. keep it intact while the enemy fleet is concentrating it\'s fire on this
rouge ship, then your destroyer *might* be effective.  I\'d guess it would
be economically and militarily inefficent.

Expensive, but very doable.

	Yes, they work by compressing and heating the H atoms enough to 
overcome the repulsive forces. But here\'s two rather different 
suggestions:

	1) Build a device which amplified these reuplsive forces, kinda 
like a reverse damper. Basically, if I can push, why can\'t I pull? This 
would at least slow down the reaction, if not stop it completely.

	2) Would projecting a damper field into a fusion engine increase 
it\'s efficency? After all, you\'d be amplifying the force that holds \'em 
together, and since you\'re trying to shove \'em together anyway...

I wasn\'t disagreeing about the size of the *smaller* ships being the size
of large airplanes, just giving some dimensions for comparison.  BTW, I
don\'t include the wings in my body volume calculations.  The wingspan on an
Airframe 200 ton ship, like I configured above..even allowing for a lifting
body shape would be (not recalculating..just estimating) about 40 meters.

Personally, I do better when I can visualize internal spaces in relation to
buildings.  I can walk around, inside and outside, similar sized buildings
and get a feel for what the ship would be like.  I can stand on the
sidewalk and visualize that 2 story apartment building coming in for a
landing...*that* impresses me, and that\'s a small ship!  Yes, "Fat Albert"
impresses me too. ;->

	The only advantage would be if they\'re non-jump capable, and using thruster 
plates. Then they can pack more guns and power per volume than a comparable jump ship, 
and force the bad guys to engage multiple targets. And if they had a crew of 2 (one 
guy to operate the snadcasters, too), and decent armor...

	So you take your scrap-heap garbage scow, stick a couple of big, surplus 
missle fusion rockets on the back, add some aluminum foil on a wire frame to make it 
look impressive, and send it on it\'s way. While the Bad Guys hit it with everything 
they\'ve got (because you\'ve been quiety leaking the fact that you\'re going to use such 
ships as big-ass KKMs), the rest of your fleet gets free shots. Plus, they\'re not 
shootuing at the targets that actually matter, and what happens if it does get 
through?

socializing influence of Imperial institutions such as the Navy and Marines), the 
Imperium may activly encourage sporting contacts between it\'s member worlds.

Firstly, it is something that the poorer and newer worlds in the Imperium can 
participate in on more-or-less even terms - an antidote to the "the Imperium exists for 
the rich worlds and megacorporations" type sentiment.

Secondly, it provides a focus for interworld and interregion rivalries.

Thirdly, it provides a great source of adventure hooks ... for example, a party with a 
starship may be approached about transporting a sports team from it\'s source world to 
the All-Corridor Athletics Meet. Two jumps before the ship reaches the sector capital, a 
shady individual offers the ships engineer a large sum of money to make sure the team 
does not arrive in time for final registration ...

The lines I am thinking of is how cricket and rugby became and were used as a source of 
unity within the British Empire in the late 19th to mid-Twentieth century ... look 
also at (for example) the 1887 Australian Aboriginal tour of England, or the way the 
West Indies cricket team is the only pan-Caribbean institution to survive inter-island 
rivalries.

Suggestions are welcome.

The Controls and Electronics section says "for Standard automation,
multiply the values listed by 5%". They have got to mean multiply the
values by 105%, or increase by 5%, unless Standard automation really is 20
times cheaper than Low automation.

The sandcaster table gives a "Beam Reduction" figure that is not explained
anywhere that I can find. It is not mentioned in the Basic or Role-Playing
combat rules. For some incomprehensible reason this figure uses d20s, which
are not used anywhere else in the game. Is this a TNE thing?

Figuring out the number of crew is ridiculously overcomplicated. First each
ship component gives a "crew factor" which I multiply by a "control
modifier" based on tech level, depending on what "category" the crew factor
is. These are divided by an "automation divisor", which differs for every
category. The rules to calculate drive crew are incomprehensible. First,
the drive tables give crew factors, but the crew requirements say to base
the crew on "the mass of the drives". Then the sample calculation uses the
drive\'s _volume_ in cubic meters; the crew factors and drive mass are never
used! People have actually been designing ships with these "rules"?

Look, every component is already listed separately in each category by tech
level; is it too much to expect IG to do these wacky calculations
beforehand and actually put the required crew instead of a "crew factor"
for each component? And to include space for engineering workstations in
the drive and powerplant table, as is done for gunnery workstations? It
would also be more convenient to normalize the automation divisor so
Standard automation has a crew of 1. All these factors, divisors, and
modifiers are unexplained magic numbers, so it\'s not as if the GM can
actually use any of them for making rulings.

As for the stateroom/bunk controversy, I have already weighed in on the
side of individual small staterooms. 28m^3 is no hotel suite, especially if
you figure about half of that goes to passageway and common area. In my
deck plans a small stateroom is about the size of a pullman cabin, which is
pretty cramped if you are expected to live there for a week. Some posters
have suggested using double-occupancy small staterooms. A small stateroom
uses only the space of two bunk stations, so this "compromise" is no
advantage to the crew. Other posters have claimed off-duty crew will be
doing maintenance and training. If they don\'t have staterooms where will
they do this? The rules have no provisions for training rooms or assembly
halls. Sure, individual designers can add them in, but without some rulings
by IG there is no way to decide their requirements or effectiveness.

***techie alert***

Take the speed in m/second at which they meet, square it, and multiply it by
the half the mass of the fighter in tons.  Divide the results by 5000 and
you have a rough estimate of the energy released in equivlant kg of TNT
going off when the fighter hits.

I\'d say you can make a table of this with mass in tons along the Y axis and
velocity along the X axis.  This will let you make a handy table for your
crazy players.  If I get really bored, I might even put one together.

Basically vulnerabilities (big missile, big target, easy to hit), and cost
effectiveness (big missile, expensive to build, need defenses, expensive
jump drives).

I ruled similarly, and also ruled that since nuclear dampers fell off
radically with range, the ND every power plant included to moderate the
reaction were far stronger than needed to override virtually any outside
source, but were only effective for a few meters outside the reaction
vessel.

Enough tech could override this, so a TL12 ship could be captured by a TL15
pirate fairly easily in this way.  Further, the dampers were only
operational if the power plant was actually running

I did have group working on a self destruct system for thier ship which
would use those immensely powerful dampers to make a chunk of superdense
explode in a delightful spray of high energy gammas.  They never finished
the device, but it kept them worried for months when they found out someone
had stolen thier notes and working papers.

This does not seem like Harry Harrison story - he has such a thing against
war that he writes it just terribly.  Could it possibly have been the
similarly named Harry Turtledove?

There was a Harry Turtledove story called Guns of the South about a group
of South African folk who bring back AK-47s to help the south win so that
they have a slave owning power to befriend in the far future.  Fairly well
written, I thought

There is a lively thread going on about in on rec.arts.sf.written right now.

Why, if it has a good guidance computer it should be able to easily hit
any planet in the system?  We are talking TL 12+ computers here.  Of
course, I\'d want the ICBM jump missle up to 1,000 kps or above when it
emerged from jump space.  Otherwise, it would be far to easy to pick off. 
Then again, it might have a moderate evade program and could pull 12
uncompensated Gs w/o harm...

Just because a ship is over 100 tons doesn\'t mean it has a jump drive in
it. There\'s no reason you couldn\'t build 100,000ton non-jump capable
battleboats. 

I\'m not against missile or gun boats, even very small ones. I just think
you\'re going to need bigger boats to do what you want.  Build 200-400ton
Boats, leave the jump drive out and you have *even* more room for missiles,
guns, thrusters, power, and that decent armor you\'re going to need.

This only makes sense if you are dealing with an *internal* problem.
When attacked by *outside* forces, troops defending the land of their
families tend to do so with more enthusiasm than those defending the
territory of someone they do not know.

It was definatly a Harry Harrison novel, as I remember it from about 10
years ago (can\'t recall its name, though). IIRC it was more of a mystery or
manhunt story than a war story, but I\'m not sure.

Different rosette. That one is "hidden". The one others have mentioned
is out in normal space. In the Tireen system.

Lots of luck, I think it\'s been out of print since SPI got bought out

Do note that the "staggered square" map *is* a hex map. All you do is
change the angles a little.

It occurs to me that this will also work well for the 3d-starmaps folks.
You just have a regular sub-sector map, and an X-Z map (actually Y-Z in
this case).  

BTW, I have another old SPI game that I consider "usable" with
Traveller. Outreach has a scale of 1200 ly (400 parsecs) per hex. So I
can use the map of the galaxy with Traveller if I ever need a "grand
strategic" map. It\'s the only thing I can think of that would show the
Zhodani core expeditions. :-)

Crew: 34		High/Mid Pass: 2/0	Low: 0

Crew: 4 Engineers, 2 Electronics, 2 Manuever, 13 Gunners, 1 Screens
      2 Aux Craft Crew, 4 Marines, 4 Command, 1 Steward, 1 Medical

Notes:
  Design is all QSDS, with hull from Wildstar\'s Big Book of Hulls (the
hull did not get the 25% discount when total cost was figured).  The Hull
is rated to 6G, so more extreme manuevers can be made in Atmosphere.  The
Missile turrets are linked by MFD.  In addition to the equipment listed
above, the ship carries a TL 12 Advanced Communications system and a 2 bed
sickbay.  

  The command crew is in four large staterooms, the crew in 13 small
staterooms, and the gunners and marines in 17 bunks.

Comments:
  This is a simple derivative of the Type 45212 I submitted for the THUDD
contest.  With an additional 100 tons, this design includes a larger
hanger, 4 nuclear dampers, ships troops, and some additional cargo space.
This addresses most of the criticisms leveled against this design, and
make it more capable.

True, very true. No matter what you do, what law you make or process you
establish, eventually it will be proven that it will cause as much or more
problem than what you were trying to fix. 

No good deed goes unpunished.

That\'s why the biggest source of adventures is the consequences of the
actions the players themselves take.

    'body' => '  I am finalizing my ideas about the Paradise system, the setting for my
Beltwatch PBEM.  Stimulated by the recent discussion about asteroid belts,
and wanting an exciting and dangerous place for the players to be in, yet
with a reason for people to be there, I came up with the following general
description.   Comments and criticism welcome.


History:

  First discovered and explored during the First Imperium, the Paradise
system was dominated by two main features.  One, an unstable star with a
high rate of solar prominances, variations in total output, and other odd
behaviours.  The star\'s output results in considerable interference with
radio communications and sensor readings, making navigation difficult. 
Two, an extremely large and tectonically unstable planet in the life zone. 
This planet had an insideous atmosphere, as well as high gravity and
unstable geology.  Lanthanum was present in significant quantities,
however, making it a tempting place.  Declared an Imperial Naval Reserve,
the system was undeveloped in industrial terms due to technological
limitation during the First Imperium, and was only visited occasionally by
scientific teams studying the star. 

  During the Rule of Man, the Reserve system broke down under the pressure
of commerical development, and the Paradise system was one of the Naval
Reserves sold off to finance government operations.  Several unsuccessful
attempts were made to mine Lanthanum in the system, but the technical
challenges proved too great.  Well before the Long Night, the system was
essentially abandoned, again with only the occasional visit by scientific
researchers. 

  There were no further recorded contacts with the system until -521, when
a Sylean survey team arrived.  They found a system that had been much
changed.  The Paradise system had encountered intersteller debris,
including (apparently) an object large enough to shatter the major planet
in the system after a glancing impact.  The resulting asteroid belt proved
to be a potentially rich source of lanthanum and other metals, but with
new hazards.  The young asteroid belt has very high densities in the areas
with the greatest mining opportunities, and there are large numbers of
asteroids that orbit out of the general plane.  This, combined with other
interstellar objects still passing through the system and the
perturbations caused by the still unstable orbital mechanics of the
debris, makes for very difficualt navigation. 


Description for M0:

  There are two major industries in the Paradise system.  One is obvious -
belters mining the system for metals, particualarly Lanthanum.  The second
is less obvious - tourism.  The combination of orbital debris, clouds of
dust and gas, as well as the highly variable star and its solar
prominances, makes for a spectacular show.  The minor danger as a
navigational problem makes the system even more exciting as a destination. 

  The inner system consists of several small rockballs, the innermost of
which is home to a small scientific research station.  The main system is
the belt, with the major population center at Paradise Home, a former
mining colony that is now a high-end resort and base for the IISS Rescue
Service for the system.  The outer system contains three gas giants, the
largest of which has several moons.  A mass driver at the innermost gas
giant delivers hydrogen to the belt.  The main starport is near the mass
driver - it is really just a transit station since trade with the belt is
carried out primarily by specially designed couriers for insurance
reasons. 

  The Paradise system is best known as the setting of the entertainment
tri-vids "Beltwatch" and "Beltwatch Knights," the former being one of the
most widely watched programs in the Imperium.  :-)

Correct. What optimizes effectiveness of troops for one situation can
minimize their effectiveness for another. Consider the French optimization
of the military for another WWI type war with Germany. Surprise! In M:0
which will Cleon be most concerned about? Will the 3I need the army to
defend worlds against the not yet assimilated pocket empires? Or will the
army need to help pacify the locals of a recently integrated world. Locally
raised troops will be great for the first, but will have less enthusiasm for
shooting at their cousins. Equip a battlion of locals with ABD & FGMPs for
defense against an outside invader and then find out that, over the next few
months,  various events and effects on their families slowly convince then
that the Imperium was not a good thing to join; so they become rebels. Well
armed rebels.

In general we have a fairly well established policy for the Imperial Navy
and Marines. What we lack is clarity about what the purpose, procedures and
methods the Imperial Army has. Given that the Imperium claims only the space
between worlds, does it really even need an army?  If interplanetary travel
and trade is the the main reason for the Imperium, with local planetary
politics left up to the locals, then enforcement of Imperial policy would be
effective by embargos and blockages. If you need some SHORT TERM objective
on a planet\'s surface, you have the Marines. Otherwise, you punish the world
by withdrawing trade privileges. Maybe make an example out of a city or two,
from a safe orbital height. Then let the locals stew in their own collapsing
economies and weight for then to come back into the fold.

Does the Imperium need an army?

Check out Turtledove\'s "Guns of the South" anyway.  Even if it isn\'t the novel 
you\'re thinking of it\'s a damn good read.  I have read a couple of novels 
concerning Racists time ttravelling back to the American Civil War... one was 
Turtledove\'s and the other, whose title and author I don\'t remember off hand, 
had a black federal agent following the racist back to try and dtop any temporal 
contamination... Does that sound familiar?

Interworld sporting contests would have to be fairly localised, given the travelling time between 
systems. Even if you had a four year cycle like the Olympics or various World Cups, you\'re still 
talking hefty road trips. If there\'s a knockout stage, it would either have to be held in one place 
or there would be immense gaps while the results filter back  to the sporting federations HQ and 
there could easily be the problem of a team setting out for a fixture whilst not being aware of 
who their opponants might be, because they haven\'t seen the results of the "other semi-final."

There\'s also the problem of home-field advantage. Miami travelling to Green Bay in December 
would be nothing compared to a belter team travelling to a high grav world!

Not neccessarily.  Rich worlds buy the talent.  Corrupt governments or megacorporations pour 
funds into sporting excellance.

Hmm... there are still problems of rivalry within West Indian cricket. When the selectors face 
the choice between a Barbadian and a Jamaican for the final place in a test side, they are 
highly unlikely to pick the Jamaican for a match in Barbados.

A few years ago, when England were due to play a test match in Guyana, many of the local 
Indian community were unhappy that the only player of Guyanese-Indian descent likely to play 
was Mark Ramprakash. (For the benefit of non-cricketing readers, Mark Ramprakash plays for 
England) It was expected to be almost a home match atmosphere for England. It was. The 
match was rained off.

Little bit of decent AI can solve that problem. This would be useful as a
terror weapon if the launching faction could develop some decent stealth
technology. Either that, or the vessle could jump into the outer expanses of
the system and take several days of flight time to reach it\'s target powered

Well the actual story was about a black marine working on  security for 
the time machine who goes back to stop him. Its a one way trip so he sets 
after he stops the nutter he helps set up a black only regiment to fight 
in the war.

Well, Gibson doesn\'t deserve all the blame. If they\'d shot the film as he\'d
written it, the result probably would have been wonderful and brilliant.
But the producers forced him to dumb it down, to cut or and rewrite
anything interesting or even slightly \'artsy\'.

In Gibson\'s original script, for instance, the digital construct of the
dead woman appeared repeatedly throughout the story, making cryptic and
subtle comments on the action, as a kind of virtual \'Greek chorus\'. One of
the producers literally screamed into Gibson\'s face: "What\'s this?
POETRY?!! We\'re not paying you to write f*ckin\' POETRY!!!" etc., veins
throbbing in his forehead, looking as if he were ready to physically
assault the author. (I heard all this from a good friend of Gibson\'s, BTW.)

_Johnny Mnemonic_ just goes to show that, in Hollywood, the more money you
throw into a project, the stupider it gets.

Hm... how, then, does one account for the white supremacist groups in the
US armed forces, which have recently been getting more media attention?
Likewise, the sexual harrassment and abuse of female soldiers?

Seems to me that intensive boot-camp experience can just as easily be a
great way of *instilling* a hatred of "the Other" -- whether intentionally
("the dirty mind-raping Zhos!") or incidentally.

This is pretty much the way I see it too -- the Imperial Army is still
pretty planet-of-origin-bound, with different units having a lot of \'local
flavor\' to them, and the Navy, Marines, and IISS being more culturally
homogenous and cosmopolitan in outlook.

I guess I don\'t see the connection between "not discriminating based on
class" and "being able to tell how one feels".  I\'ve understood Zhodani
society to be much more homogenous and more closely integrated than
Imperial society, and at least as class-conscious -- so I have a little
trouble seeing how the possession of psionics by certain social classes
makes the existence different standards of behaviour for different classes
unlikely.  Can you expand on this a little further?  It sounds interesting.

"FF&S: Completely updated and integrated into the T4 edition of the
Traveller game, Fire Fusion, & Steel is the comprehensive vehicle
design system.  Everything from ground cars to grav tanks, system
patrol boats to atmospheric cruisers, the rules let you design each
vehicle down to the last detail to suit your adventures or your
campaign."

There is NO mention of starships.

"NAM: Create accurate, realistic, detailed deck plans.  Naval
Architect\'s Manual is the in-depth guide to starship layouts, form
workstations and staterooms to bio-engineered living quarters and
holo-observ-decks.  The complete guide to detained starship operations
and design, fully illustrated with dozens of deck plan segments for
starships, starports, and bases."

Sounds like an architect\'s guide to interior decorating.

This was all taken from the 1997 Traveller Product Catalog I received
in the mail a week ago.  Before it arrived, I queried IG about the
products on their webpage and asked for more than the single sentence
description only some of them had.  I never got a response.

With the basic starship construction system in the original rules, the
rules in Starships, and whatever will appear in the Deluxe T4
hardbound edition leads you to believe that they will be publishing
yet another book on starship construction (FF&S or NAM-- who knows?).
CSC also contains a relatively detailed vehicle design system, yet
FF&S is going to include even more detailed rules.  I detect a lot of
confusion a year from now...

Excellent idea, Ian!

I had a Navy Captain character in a game a while back that had been on the
Academy Gravball team.  He used gravball references and metaphors all the
time..drove the other PC\'s nuts.  <g> He followed gravball teams at all his
duty stations.  The first thing he read from Naval dispatchs was always the
latest on the Acadamy Gravball Team.  He *suggested* that his crew form a
gravball team and compete with local teams everywhere they went.  <G> 

I never actually created *rules* for the game, but it was sort of a 3d
water polio/team handball/hockey combination played in a zero-g
environment.  I imagined a large oval (ellipsoidal) court with "kick-off"
posts and platforms located at various places and goals at either end,
played by two, nine person teams.  The object was to put a ball into your
opponents goal..any way you can.  The ball was carried on a "stick"..hooked
stick with small net on the end
(hockey/lacross).  The stick, of course, was also good for changing
direction by hooking around a post and whacking your opponent\'s stick to
knock the ball loose...and whacking your opponent too!  <g>

I invented a few plays and terms that my PC used in his normal conversation
like, "Pop the Post"-kick off the a wall or a post to gain momentum and
change direction (change the subject or try something new), "Screen and
Whip"-teammates set a screen while someone whips the ball carrier around it
at high velocity breaking them out toward the opponents goal (use teamwork
to solve a
problem), and "Flip Tricking"-rotating in place (flip) but passing to a
teammate in passing rather than shooting on goal (fool the other guy).  I
also stole a few from basketball and hockey like "blue wall (line)"-if you
broke the blue wall ahead of the ball you were offside, "hat trick"-3 goals
in a game (an Ace was 5!), "slam dunk"-driving the ball through the
opponents and into the goal with *extra* force and "give and go"-pass the
ball to a teammate, reverse and dive for the goal, recieving a pass back as
you attempt to score.  Imagine a PC using terms like this to discribe
tactics in space combat...or just everyday actions. <g>

Absolutely!  That\'s a good one.  <g> Or the PC\'s are hired to
*protect* a team on tour..from fans, gambler hired thugs, each other and
themselves.

Which would mean that the role of the Imperial Army is to provide the muscle
behind enforcement of the rules and regulations in an on going role. Which
would then mean that, to assure the effectiveness in this role, the Imperial
Army would have to be more loyal to the Imperium than the local government,
taking us back to the idea that Imperial Army units are NOT raised on the
worlds  where they are stationed to make sure they do not have a conflict of
interest when they are called out to enforce the Imperial Will.

In the 1100\'s, it may be that Army units are stationed on the worlds where
they are raised, fuelling the fires of the Last Civil War, but in the first
years of the 3I, we may need to assume that point of recruitment and duty
station are different worlds entirely.  

Or we can assume that the \'Imperial Army\' is a fiction; a label added to any
local noble\'s bodygaurds to make them and the noble appear more important,
but that when push comes to shove in a local dispute with the Iridium
Throne, the true source of Imperial Law Enforcement, the Navy and Marines,
are infinitly willing to turn their guns on the Army.

Disagree strongly. I want an abstract basic system - I don\'t want to reach
for a hex map and acres of space when i run a starship combat. I am
interested in *roleplaying* with my and the players imagination. If I
wanted to use a board game I\'d dig out BL, or BR, or Star Cruiser, or Star
Warriors, or Silent Death.... However, we could compromise and put both
board and abstract movement in a new set of rules...

You could easily graft these rules onto a High Guard based system.

You just have each band as a number of hexes ;-)

That\'s how I view and play combat in T4 but I use sensors too.

As you may have guessed, I\'m in the other camp. I would suggest abstract as
standard, detailed \'exact\' as an option. Abstract can be done anywhere
(particularly in places like the bar where we play). Hexes etc can\'t.

But under the rules available the biggest ship you can get it 5000 dt (H2)

Yes. High Guard had a very simple boarding resolution roll - useful for NPC

Mentioned above. Should be in the rules for T4 anyway - Naval characters

I get your idea - perhaps a \'typical\' hit should be described - the ref can

Yes. I agree wholeheartedly. But the compatibility has to be back at the

Another thought - Let\'s get the tables & rules in T4 to run from TL0 to
TL16. Then the main rules can handle anything from 0 to 1100, plus the
Darrians....

I agree. Kind of. And I think I have the answer.

If you go over older releases of sector list you will not the following =

	A - Imperial Naval co-located with Imperial Scout
	B - Imperial Naval co-located with Imperial Scout Way Station
	G - Military Garrison

	W - Imperial Scout Way Station

	Nope, nuclear dampers work on fusion reactions as well. Otherwise they\'d

When you have a sample of several million humans you are bound to have some
"sports" out on the extremes.

The important thing to note is that the US armed services aren\'t
tolerating, or covering up, these extremists, nor the sexual harassers. 
That would be the traditional way of handling this sort of trash, cover it
up and try to handle it "in house."  Most of the time this was said to be
"for the good of the service", but I\'ve never really bought into that. 
I\'ve particularly been troubled by the events at the Citidal, these young
men are training to be our *officer* class!  I don\'t want brutes and
sadists leading our troops.

Today\'s environment leans *strongly* toward exposure and ruthless
elimination of these prejudices and anti-social attitudes.  I just hope we
don\'t over-react and end up with "witch hunts" that sweep in innocent
parties.  Like most countries we have a long history of that, as well.

Ob Traveller:  I suspect the Imperial Forces would absolutely *not*
tolerate this sort of behavior.  With several hundred million (billions?)
of servicebeings toleration should be the Order of the Day.

I blame a lot of this on the decline of common courtesy, personal
responsibility and individual honor.  (We could argue that this decline is
in step with the decline of overt religious practice, but let\'s not.)  I
see the Imperium as a more "honorable", *much more courteous society.

According to the catalog they mailed out, FF&S is the complete design

Interestingly, I just ran a two ship combat abstractly, USING HEXES, but no
hexmap. The ships were X hexes apart to start. When each moved they became
Y hexes apart. I handled weapons fire and missiles the same way. I just
kept track of the current range, and a little positioning information, on a
sheet of paper. I didn\'t, and the PCs, didn\'t care about the exact position
of the ships...just their relative position and facing. It worked very
well.

Don\'t ask me for exact rules though.  I used RPSCS 0.9..sort of, T4\'ish
weapons and basically "winged" the details.  

My point, though, is you (well *I*) can abstract from a detailed system
more easily than I can detail from an abstract one.

As it says in the T4 rulebook, there are many milieus that will be 
supported.  "The Virus Era," as it is called in that book, is mentioned.

The original idea was to get milieu books out at a rate of 1 or 2 per 
year.  However, that was changed - at least in the case of M:0 - because 
it didn\'t allow enough time for supporting materials for each Milieu to 
be produced before the next one came out.  So, rather than produce a 
bunch of under-supported milieu books, they chose to push M:200 back from 
a release date in this year to sometime next year.

As for when "The Virus Era" mileu book will be produced, I can\'t say for 
certain.  It\'s too far off to even think about . . .

	Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I\'ve been hoping that you\'d get around to doing
this at some point.  Those huge maps were way frustrating (I kept sitting
there thinking what I pity it was that they were unprintable)...

	If I can make another suggestion, I think that better control over
the basics of the system (such as primary type, number of gas giants, etc)
would be a lot of fun.  As it is, I can\'t get it to do a system with a type
O star as a primary..:)

	Actually, something you might want to do is have charts and
schematics print black-on-white; easier for those of us who own ye olde
StyleWriters.

	And, coincidentally, today I decided to kick another campaign off
towards mid-May; can you get the upgrade done in two-three weeks :)?

		Here\'s an idea: stick a couple fixed-mount sandcasters 
in front, and make a huge, hemispherical cloud of sand. if the "capital 
missle" were remote controlled, they could easily guide it in, even 
though the missle itself is virtually blind. And, it would increase it\'s

===================================================================================
"VMTTS" (vee-mitts) - VARIANT MEGATRAVELLER TASK SYSTEM FOR TRAVELLER 4TH EDITION, VERSION 1.0
===================================================================================

This system uses 2D instead of a varying number of dice in all cases. 

Roll the target number or above to succeed. Roll less than the
target number and you have failed. DMs are always applied to the die
roll, not the target number. An unmodified roll of 2 is _always_ a 
failure. It is not always an exceptional failure, however ; see below.
There is no equivalent automatic success result.

Difficulty levels remain as per their T4 descriptions. Target numbers are
Easy/Simple 3+, Average/Routine 7+, Difficult 11+, Formidable 15+, Staggering 19+ 
and Impossible 23+. ( In effect, Staggering is old Impossible, and Impossible is now yet one
task level higher still ). The sequence 3-7-11-15-19-23 should be easy to
remember.

Roll two points or more below the target number for Exceptional / Spectacular
failure. Roll two points or more above the target number for Exceptional /
Spectacular success.

Characteristics - only one may modify a given task roll. Characteristics
in the range 6-8 do not modify tasks - they are assumed to be average human ranges.
Apply DM -1 for characteristic 2-5 ( below average human ). 
Apply DM +1 for characteristic 9-B ( above average human ). 
Apply DM +2 for characteristic C-F ( exceptional human ).
Apply DM +3 for characteristic G+  ( superhuman ).

Tasks may be modified in the following ways -

SAFE          - Exceptional Failure cannot occur. Any failure result is
                a normal failure, even a "natural" 2. Mishaps cannot occur.
(NORMAL)      - "Natural" 2 is a 2D mishap. Exceptional Failure and Normal
                Failure are not mishaps.
HAZARDOUS     - Exceptional Failure is a 2D mishap. A "natural" 2 is a 3D
                mishap. Normal Failure is not a mishap.
FATEFUL       - Normal failure is a 2D mishap. Exceptional Failure and
                "natural" 2 are 3D mishaps.

UNCERTAIN     - Referee rolls 1D, player rolls the other. Player can thus make
                educated guess as to outcome.

UNSKILLED OK  - Quoted skill(s) are not essential. If a task is not Unskilled OK,
                and the character has not got the right skill(s), +2 task difficulty levels.
                If the character has a related skill, +1 task difficulty levels. Jack-Of-All-Trades
                may be applied at half possessed level in the place of any
                missing skill.
CONFRONTATION - Both sides roll task - highest modified roll wins. Equal rolls are
                stalemates.

HASTY         - Increase task difficulty level by one. Time taken = Time taken x 0.5
CAUTIOUS      - Decrease task difficulty level by one. Time taken = Time taken x 2.0

Skill level-0 is assumed to be basic, rudimentary knowledge, enough to incur no
Unskilled Penalty. T4 usually assumes that level-0 in a skill means no knowledge -
I prefer the complete absence of a skill on a character sheet to reflect no
knowledge at all, and level-0 to be "green".

I cap skill levels at level 5. Only rare genius can go higher !

Retry attempts can be made as follows -

If previous attempt resulted in ...           Retry task ...

Mishap                                        Not possible
Exceptional Failure                           At one higher difficulty level
Normal Failure                                At same difficulty level

If the character has Jack-Of-All-Trades, he or she can retry exceptional failures
on a given repeated task at no task difficulty penalty a number of times equal to
his or her Jack-Of-All-Trades level. After that is spent, normal penalties start to
accrue.

As with Cautious tasks, there is no Check Determination task for retries in this
system.

T4 is based on a multiple dice "large number system". Some DMs, such DM +9 for
darkness etc are too large to be applied to this system. My suggestion is to rate each
case on individual merit, and scale DMs to -3 through +3 from their original value.

That\'s all folks. I assume you have MT and access to the Mishap tables etc. Let me know
what you think.

Actually, it has been promised that a fix will be posted on the web site,
or otherwise be made available. I agree with you, it is a MAJOR oops, a
simple slip of the programming finger, but one that shouldn\'t have been
let out. IIRC the same problem applies to First Survey as well. 

I personally think that they should get the $@#!$@ fix out asap, since
this data is well-nigh unusable...a problem with atmosphere, hyrosphere
and suchlike could have been dealt with, but law level and government
types are the heart of how ROLE-PLAYERS deal on a given world.

Fortunately Milieu 0 has got lots of good stuff to make up for that. FS
doesn\'t, and I\'m not tempted at all to spend money on that one.

Also, I agree with you on the Imperium way of doing business, but what do
you expect of an expansionist Imperialist/Capitalist bunch
running dog lackeys of Sylea Street? 

The section on Scout Service contact procedures, is rightly labeled (in
the book) as Secret...there would be large howls of opposition were it
generally known that this is how the oh-so-honorable Clunastu dynasty does
business.

Quite simple, really. All the Imperium needs to do is say "OK, you don\'t
have to pay taxes, but then you can\'t use our space." No trade, no nothing.
A total blockade would destroy that planets economy, and probably force its
TL way down.

In my Lunion subsector campaign Rollerball (like the movie) is the rage.
Every three years there\'s an interplanetary competition for the subsector
title.. lots of possibilities, from pulling a Tonya Harding to transporting
rabid fans to the finals.

Once I write it all down, i\'ll put up the rules and history on my web pages.

The presence of white-supremacist groups has been vastly overblown.  A small
group publishes a hate \'zin at Ft. Bragg and suddenly the Special Forces are
trading Green Berets for white hoods according to the media.  Some people
won\'t change.  They tend not to get very far, or they end up in dead-end
assignments.

The allegations of sexual abuse at APG are abhorrent to every professional
soldier I know.  Not just the the impropriety of the act, but that *Drill
Sergeants* would violate the trust placed in them.  These guys need to be
given harsh penalties.  Also, remember that many of the femal soldiers have
now admitted to voluntarily sleeping with the Drills, which is a violation
of the Uniform code of Military Justice all on its own!

Well, that is part of it.  A minor part.  While my OSUT time was spent in
expatation of fighting the Godless Communists(tm) in the Fulda Gap, they
never really went to any pains to make us hate our enenmy.  In truth, the
biggest bigotry I carry from my Army days is against the U.S. Navy!  (5
straight years, squids!  Y\'all do remember how to play football, right?)

Some worlds are Imperial territory (reserves, Naval Depots, prison planets)
but the majority rule themselves.

Picture the Imperium as something akin to the UN.. While the Imperium
debates the big issues, the indivdual worlds run their own scene. The
Imperium had over 11,000 *member* worlds.. big difference.

The Imperium guaranteed free trade to its members.  It provides this by
protecting the space lanes, standardizing money, insuring legal avenues are
availble to settle disputes, and providing a common cultural base from which
to operate.  In return, a member world pays a small percentage of its Gross
Planetary Income as taxes, cedes small areas for Consulates and bases, and
agrees to recognize Imperial sovereignty over the space lanes.

Yes, but the individual world has complete latitude in how it is run.  Thus
you get the Gov B, Law E hell-holes we all love.  The Imperium only demands
some minmal law enforcement (mainly a prohibition on slavery) and
cooperation with Imperial authorities.

Absolutely.  The Army exists to provide the Imperium with the means to
defend its member worlds, and to conquer hostile worlds during times of war.
The term "Imperial Army" refers to the command and support structure that
allows designated units to operate as a cohesive force, as well as those
combat elements.

Remember that the modern United States Army has over 50% of its combat
assets in either the National Guard or Reserve.  The NG is under state
control, and generally does not answer to the federal government.  They do,
however, accept training and equipment from the Regular Army, and when
called upon to serve, will generally do so.

This is the situation in the Imperium.  The various worlds maintain military
forces for their own defence, and allow a portion of those units to be under
the control of the Imperium in exchange for cutting edge equipment and
increased training opportunities.

In theory, this will work.  It also should have won WWII on both the German
and Japanese fronts.  The Japanese home islands were cut off completely by
1945, with shortages of everything.  They had no Navy, no Air Force, and no
real hope.  Without the atom bomb, the Allies would have had to invade,
since even with the hardships they faced, the Japanese were still defiant.
Estimated casualties from Operation Olympic were around 1 million dead or
wounded.

The Army is the heavy guns.. the guys who go in and occupy the enemy cities
and inform them that the rules have *changed*.  It has to be done by ground
troops.. they have to see it happen.

Very true, and I have decided to use designations as opposed to names, to
further emphasise the difference between the Terrans and Imperials.  The
Terrans will have your typical names (Invinciable, Constellation, Sydney
etc) while the Imperials (translated anyway) will use designations like
CV-065, HS-0012, DD-1137 etc.

This is true, and a soldiers effort to defend *his* home can not be
under stated, but only so far as the discipline and training of the
troops goes.  For instance, your average Roman Soldier from Rome or Italy
would make that extra effort when defedning Rome itself, but I am just as
likely to believe that they would make a supureme effort defending
Cisalpine Gaul against the Germans as they would A) consider it Roman
territory and B) they would be Roman colonists there.

Look at the dogged defense of the Germans of occupied Russia and Poland
against the Soviets, it was just as well defended as Germany proper was.
The reason\'s why, they fought hard to get those territories, they had
excellent training and discipline (what was left of the original veteran
force from France) and they knew if they did not stop or delay them where
they were, then the Fatherland and there family would eventually suffer
for it.  Just my 2 credits.

Uh, thought it did that already.  I suspect the colour/B&W commands need
changing: these really (at the moment) change the background from black to
white!  (It\'s not a bug, it\'s a feature.)  Try selecting the "Black & White"
command under the View menu.  You should get colour worlds on a white
background.  The results look pretty good on a LaserWriter (printing
Colour/Grayscale).

The bigger the fighter, the better.  In a sense, your 200-ton and 400-ton
SDBs could be considered "really heavy fighters".  Technically speaking,
anything under 100 tons is a fighter, and anything 100 tons and over is
either a boat (if it\'s based on a world or other static location) or a rider
(if it\'s based on a jump-capable ship).  The difference in capabilities
between a 90-ton fighter and a 100-ton SDB would be pretty minimal, and
they\'re still pretty non-survivable against cruiser-sized or bigger
oponnents.

KABOOM!

> How do you handle the to-hit possibilities,

The PC would pretty much have to ride the fighter all the way down to
impact.  If he or she ejects before then, the fighter becomes ballistic, and
is easy to avoid (even at the last second).  Assuming that the fighter has
equal or better acceleration that the target, a hit should be easy to
achieve (roll against pilot skill).  The big drawback is that point-defense
fire from the target should also be pretty easy; the PC is more likely to
get shot down than to miss the target.

> and how do you handle damage?

BIG KABOOM!

> by the mass of the fighter? the speed at which they meet in G\'s?

By the mass of the fighter and the impact velocity (in range bands/turn, not
Gs).  For any reasonable sized fighter at readily-achievable speeds, the
impact is going to have energy of thermonuclear proportions: the PC and his
fighter wind up as plasma; the target is almost certainly destroyed (a
10-ton fighter, after 2 turns of acceleration, should have enough kinetic
enerrgy to clobber a ship in the million-ton range).

> What if the PC packs it full of high explosives and command-detonates
> it after he ejects?

He\'d get a bigger bang if he used lead (the kinetic energy of a kilogram of
_anything_ traveling at those speeds is higher than the chemical energy in
any explosive).

The fighter isn\'t likley to hit anything if if the pilot ejects - the course
is too predictable, and too easy to evade.

It\'d be tough to do practically: the remote-control time lag would make
hitting the target difficult, and there\'s too many ways for the target (and
escorts) to disable the ram-ship or knock out it\'s communications.

A crude version of this tactic was featured in _Dagger at Efate_, a very
early Amber Zone in the Journal of the Travelers\' Aid Society, many years
ago.  Against a defended target, you\'d have to launch a lot of them, and
it\'d be expensive (jump drives are expensive things to just throw away).
Intercepting and destroying these things would be a GOOD use for the
high-acceleration 200-ton and 400-ton SDBs, though.

> available that replaces the jump fuel with a bigger warhead. Comments?

Again, hard to hit with, so you need to send lots of them.  If you\'re in
the same system as the target world you could just lob rocks at the
target (deadfall ordinance).  These are much cheaper than ships, and make
the same pretty explosions when they hit the planet.

 As far as the \'easy to intercept\', I\'d have to disagree. Within T4, CT,
and even systems with limited delta-v you could get it up to at *least*
60hexes/turn before it runs out of gas, and it would only require minor
thrustor corrections to change it\'s heading enough to hit(Rember that
because of the lightspeed lag, it would know where the space station is
far before the defenders knew they were under siege) and hence the time
that defenders would have to intercept would be very small..
 Of course, good point defense should be able to shoot down alot, that\'d
be the only layer of defense though. I could picture some huge bulk
missile carrier jumping into the outer system and launching a huge swarm
of these very cheap thruster plate + fusion plant + fuel + battery
missiles. Once it got to a sufficent speed(lots of space for that) it
could go quiet and rely on batteries and a passive sensor or a agent
brodcasting(or even a simple transponder. By nature, any space station
would have to be easy to find unless it was a military only situation).. 
 Even if finding it would be a problem, rember that throughout history it
hasn\'t been hard to find semi-skilled individuials who are willing to
sacrifice their lives for a \'worthy\' cause... If all else fails, they
could just brainwash em.

Well, whatever\'s easier.  I would think that it would be easier to 
have a detailed system first, then do some general, abstracted 
guidelines from your hard and fast rules--not the other way around.  
This is why I suggested using a detailed system with an abstract

Well, can a meson gun be used as a spinal mount weapon on a 5000 dt 
ship?  I actually don\'t design a lot of star ships, so I don\'t know.

The point is, like Dom has alluded to, the BSCS should be designed 
with the QSDS in mind and vice versa.  

That\'s the point I was trying to make in my original post to which 
Dom is responding.  Why have meson guns, black globes, and screens in 
the BSCS if the ships being designed in QSDS don\'t use them?

My suggestion all along has been--

We\'ve got a chance now to make T4 revised the best edition of

Excellent point!!!!

I remember some discussion about this when T4 Book 1 first  came out. 
 Some, including me, were under the impression that the T4 main book 
would be independent of melieu, but when we got it, it was definitely 
geared towards M0.

The main book for T4 should be melieu independent.  The supplements 
provided for each melieu should be the book that is geared towards a 
specific era.

bickering and fighting between the army and navy!  ;-)

What the dogface says is true... the best fights were always between the
Navy/Marines/Army. Nobody ever fought the Airfarce as there was no
challenge.

Very good question that about what sensor ops do and they same could be
asked about astrogators. But the above <Skill + Attribute + Automatic
Range> is totally unacceptable! With the sensor has range 0.00000 the
attribute would still give 6 hexes (huh). Skill increase should always be
multipliers to range or adds to logaritmized sensor factor (adding logs is
the smae as multiplying). The same can be said about damage; damage should
be multiplied by task result.
I agree that this is a bit off topic but I had to say it.

The problem with hexes on the ground is (as everybody knows) that rooms etc
have 90 degree corners forcing the players to zig-zag when moving north but
not when moving east. In space combat it\'s not such a big problem but no
real advantages for hexes either. One big drawback for hexes is in 3D. Why
should one view of the playing surface be square grid and the other not?
When designing a 3D system please refrain from giving preferred dimensions.
I\'d say hexmaps are here because most RPG are carrying old archaic stuff
from the bad old wargame days (hitpoints etc).

But as you\'re all free to do whatever you like in your universe by all
means keep the damned hexmaps.

I tip for hexophiles: if you can live with nonperfect hexes it is possible
to inscribe a regular 1m hexmap onto a 1.5 meter grid thus giving you 1m
hexes (much better scale) and you can still use the old shipplans without
having to do the rather large change I did: changing the scale from 1.5 to
1m thus reducing displacement to 1 dton = 5 m3.

Buy Marathon Infinity and draw the ships with the editor including the cool

The Imperium seems especially picky about these things:

Slavery, psionics (post psi suppression), ABC weaponry and robots posing as
humans. Note that ABC weaponry are totally out of the question for mercs,
planetary govs by the Imperial Rules of war yet TNE and also T4(?) imply
that all shipowners with missile launchers can own (heck, even use) x-ray
nuke missiles in space combat. As KE missiles are quite deadly I rule that
the only legal missiles for civilians (traders etc) are small operated
guided (no homing) KE missiles and by small I mean about 50 kg sizes.
They\'re mostly nuclear fission driven lasercomm guided cheapshots. An
enterprising noble sells small missile launchers that you mount in the
airlock for those lacking missile launchers (he also runs a private jail
for neighbouring worlds).

I model (sort of) the Imperium on the British Empire in the previous
century. The brits tradition of sportmanship, stiff-neckedness and
upholder-of-civilized-valuesness. This is how the Nobles see themselves but
not necessarily how they behave (just as in the brits case). Keeping
natives as troops, going native etc all adds fun stuff to your campaigns.

You are definitely right. It *was* a Harry Harrison story -- don\'t 
recall the name offhand, and i don\'t have the book handy (its in 
storage downstairs somewhere).

Some of the facts are wrong, though. The racist/redneck didn\'t take 
back an AK, however, he took back samples of and plans for a Sten Gun 
(a British WW2 MG -- the current Sterling SMG is sort of similar). 
The Sten was such a simple design that even the Maquis (the FFI -- 
French Resistance) was able to make copies with what amounted to hand 
tools! A well equipped bicycle factory was capable of turning them 
out.

Said redneck also took back enough gold (IIRC) to set up a basic 
production facility and/or get the attention he needed from the CSA 
authorities.

The "uptime" authorities determine his likely plans and send back a 
black sergeant/MP to track him down. It is, however, pretty much a 
one way trip -- he does, and uses the money to get Black Regiments up 
and running at least a year (IIRC) before they were historically.

When he is finally approached by an aged, but recognisable, member of 
the uptime team and offered a chance to go home, however, he does 
some quick questioning and "proves" that the "time travel" theory 
they were using was flawed -- he is really an alternate and in an 
alternate dimension. And he stays behind to follow up his work.

Hope that helps.

For what it is worth, the local SF club (PorSFiS) has pins and bumper
stickers that say "I support Little League Rollerball". And every once
and a while they have a "PorSFiS Rollerball team practice" (they get
together at a local amusement park that features a roller-skating

Well, I kinda like the "flavor" the other way would give. 

Gold is worth about as much as lead. Natural gemstones and semiprecious
stones (even "decorative" building stones like marble and granite) are
still worth money.

Organics are *valuable*, as it\'s the *arrangement* of atoms, not the
atoms themselves that are worth money. So spices, drugs, and even oil
are worth money.

And manufactured items are worth money, because of the ffort in
manufacturing them from the raw elements.

So in essence, the only things that lose value are metals and metal
ores.

Even simpler "rule of thumb". 

At 3 km/sec the ship hits as if it was an equal mass of TNT. The TNT
equivalent changes as the *square* of the velocity. So at 1 km/sec it\'s
equivalent to 1/9th its mass in TNT. At 30 km/sec it\'s equivalent to
*100* times its mass in TNT.

What I was thinking on was that since they can tell how you *really*
feel about things, they are less likely to interfere with the
"happiness" of *anyone* as long as that happiness falls within the
"norms". 

Most of the class distinctions the Zhodani have are "earned" (or at
least thought to be). But I can\'t see how you "earn" the right to love
a particular gender rather than another.

*If* they feel homosexuality is wrong, they\'ll repress it. 

If they feel that it is ok, then there\'s not much point in denyingh it
to the proles. The one class difference I can think of would be that
they\'d be more likely to insist that *non*-proles have kids so as to
pass on their superior genes. The higher your class, the more insistent
they\'d get. If you are a prole, it\'s no great loss if you don\'t pass
them on. :-)

Just what *exactly* do you mean by "abstract"? It\'s not really
*possible to do combat without something to represent the ships and
something to show where they are/will be in relationship to each other.
Anything more abstract than Mayday or the "lay them out on the table
and measure" version of the Book 1 rules is *too* abstract. You might
as well just roll arbitary dice and assign damage that way.

The roleplaying *is* present, in that you get to determine your moves
within the bounds of what your ship can do, and the success of attacks
(and some defenses) will depend on *both* the spatial relationship of
the ships *and* character skills like gunnery, and maybe even pilot. 

But anything more abstract would be like not bothering about who was
where in the room/area when the fight starts.

I\'ve often wondered if it\'d be possible to come up with a "book combat"
type system (like "Ace of Aces") for Traveller small ship actions. That
is, each ship has a "book". You start out at one of several pages
depending on the situation at the start of combat. Each of you chooses
from one of the manuevers listed as possible on that page, and you both
go to the resulting page, which gives a view of the now current
situation, and you keep going like this until you escape, get killed,
or get a kill.

I know that it\'s *only* possible for one-on-one battles. And you\'d have
to carry the results of the attacks on a ship data sheet. But it might
work out ok.

But it can\'t be local tech level in all cases, since you have worlds with
very low populations and high tech levels. It takes quite a few people to
run an industrial society. I\'d imagine that it would take even more to
run a high-tech society, though I admit that it\'s debatable. However, my
suggestion for interpreting TLs is that they represent the level that a
majority of the people on the planet enjoy. Thus when you have a Class A
starport on a medium-tech planet it means that TL 10+ stuff is available
(at least at the starport), but that most people don\'t use it. And when
you have a low-population planet with a high technology, it means that
they make enough money to buy the stuff they use from off-world (most
common example would be a mining outpost).

I was. I remember a scene in one of Ellis Meacham\'s books about the Bombay
Marine where Merewether get a company of sepoys aboard and gets a short
list of what to feed who and what work he\'s allowed to put them to. And
that was just for two different religions. Multiply that by the few dozen
prejudices you can get from any culturally heterogenous world and multiply
that by the number of worlds in the imperium and you get a situation that
any Imperial commander would prefer to avoid.
  
>If you assume computerized book-keeping and accounting (run by Vilani
>quartermasters) then the logistics shouldn\'t be a problem.  

Make that "shouldn\'t be an unsolvable problem" and I\'ll agree. My point is
that it\'s a complication that the Imperial militaries would prefer to 
avoid _if possible_. So the question becomes: 1) does the Imperial militaries
have a sufficiently big manpower pool to select only compatible troops? And,
b), is it politically possible for then to select only compatible troops?
I think the abswer to the first part of the question is yes. The second
part? Ay, that\'s the rub. Certainly we know that they use Aslan and Vargr
troops. But Aslans and Vargr represent a not inconsiderable slice of the
Imperial citizenry. Just because they cater to them is no proof that they\'d
cater to the followers of some obscure religion on a single world. Or to
temperature-challenged people or bigots or...

>It would be no different than having a species-specific regiment.  

Oh yes it would. first of all the requirements of a species-specific 
regiment are genuine ones. If, politically, you need to include Aslans
in the military, then you _have_ to provide for their specific needs.
But not eating this and not serving with people of particular shade or
a particular religious or philosophical persuasion is an artificial
problem. My gut reaction is that having to cater to a lot of genuine
problems would make the Imperial militaries _less_ inclined to accept
artificial problems.

Now, if you come up with something that is tied to a large slice of the
Imperial citizenry (like most Vilani, or the followers of a pan-Imperial
religion) then the Imperium could well be forced to cater to it. But 
otherwise I doubt it.

Relative to nuclear transformation, sure.  Chemically, it\'s still 
quite high (though perfectly feasible, as you say).

With all due deference to one who may know an awful lot more than I 
about the practicalities of semiconductors, this strikes me as a 
little unlikely.  Because the energy gap between diamond\'s full and 
empty energy levels, which is in the eV range IIRC, even really 
serious amounts of doping mightn\'t make it a very good semiconductor. 
Especially as the most chemically feasible dopants would be boron and 
nitrogen - other candidates are too big to fit easily into a diamond 
lattice - which don\'t have atomic energy levels particularly suitable 
for doping, I believe.

Diamond does have some obvious advantages as a semiconductor over 
silicon, but the band-gap may be just too large for it to semiconduct 
properly at typical voltages.

That will be one factor.  However, economics being what it is, since 
it will be cheaper to produce lanthanum from a largely 
lanthanum-bearing lode, for example, lanthanum will still come from 
high-quality mineral deposits or asteroids.  "Incidental" mineral 
extraction might work much the same way as now: a company refines its 
nickel-iron asteroid, removes all the additional elements without 
sorting them (quicker and cheaper) and sells on the resulting amalgam 
to a specialist extraction firm.

Raw elements will cost according to i) demand and ii) the cheapest 
means of supplying that demand.  Let\'s say that nickel-iron asteroids 
contain trace amounts of lanthanum (La) and asteroid deposits can be 
quite rich in La.  If there is no economic demand for vast quantities 
of Ni/Fe, then it isn\'t cheaper to get La as a byproduct of asteroid 
refining, it\'s cheaper to find and process a deposit of rich ore.  It 
may be much quicker, too, which implies a faster return on capital.

So elements will cost according to local abundance, i.e. abundance in 
the richest easily-available source, with a tradeoff between ease of 
availability and richness.

Of course, if a civilisation wished for political reasons to exist 
off their own resources, they could - but it would be expensive.  
Still, worlds like Ruie/Regina and Nouveau Quebec Libre/Troll may
have their own reasons for choosing to do so, or it might be the
result of an Imperial blockade.

        First, is the old MT idea, adjusted to account for the extra DMs
obtained when dividing Att/3 instead of Att/5. Second, makes the maximum

        I agree. But then, you will never use Impossible in actual play, so
drop the name, and drop the "Nearly" also.

        Sounds as a easy to add house rule. Anyway, I keep the "Hazardous"
class of tasks from MT. If a task is stated as Hazardous, then Mishaps are
automatically 3D.

        If you use 4D mishaps, you have to add two levels, 21+ and 24+. I do
not like rolling more than 3D, even for mishaps. I think 2D/3D is enough to
distinguish among mishaps.

        I know, there\'s no difference for 1 to 3 D damage weapons. Why
should there be? After all, these are "low damage weapons", you are not
usually able to do a lot of damage with them.. if you want to, then do
called shots.

        Thanks... I think there should be a relationship between the 3:1
attr:skills assumption and the increase in levels, at least for mnemonic
purposes.

I\'m just back from a short stay in Disneyland Paris, and I started
wondering about TL 12+ amusement parks.

First of all, even the best theme park would probably be of local
(in-system) interest at best. I can\'t really imagine anyone who would
take a 2-week round trip (plus associated costs) just to visit an
amusement park.
It\'s more "realistic" to envision a franchising scheme: you buy/rent
equipment, know-how (and the rights to use the name) from a
MegaCorporation which works on theme parks, and then create the place
on your planet...  just like Disneyland Paris, in a sense.

A classical staple of these places is the concept of different
"zones". They tipically consist of a "Western", "Pirates" and
"Fantasy" zone, plus, in some cases, "Far Future" or other
high-action themes.

This poses a problem... even if "Western" is a purely American
concept, most boys and girls on earth know about Indians and Cowboys
and can enjoy the place. The same for Fairy Tales and similar Fantasy
themes.  What would the themes be for a Star Spanning culture?
Perhaps you could draw ideas from the basic services (i.e.
ScoutLand, MerchantLand, MarineLand...) which should be a sort of
cultural glue for the Imperial culture, after all. Another natural
would be the obvious "AncientLand" theme, and possibly a "local" zone
(V-Land, Regina-Land, whatever...) which could use themes linked to
the local society and culture.
Aliens themes (VargLand) could be a possibility, but they should show
some respect to the original race or risk some serious action from
enraged aliens dignitaries.

The other problem is the attractions themselves.
Any idea on what you could offer, given the high TL, and barring VR
(for reasons I\'ll explain later) ?
The most obvious idea is the massive use of robots, just like in the
_Westworld_ movie. In fact, the robots in the movie seem compatible
with the ideas in CSC (big central computers would control the
various units).
Given the high cost and limited use of robots in CSC, their use in
large numbers for amusement purposes seems logical enough to me...
The widespread use of robots suggests a kind of theme park in which
people would take part in some sort of LARP, just like in the movie,
and this would probably be enjoyed mostly by adults.
You could probably intermix the two ideas (LARP and conventional
theme park). For example you, as an adult, could buy a special ticket
which allows you to take part in some kind of adventure against robot
opponents inside one of the zones, and at the same time you will act
as part of the background action for other visitors which enjoy the
"conventional" attractions.
You could choose various kind of adventures, combat-oriented, spy
stories, romance, solo or team missions and vary the violence, sex
and physical action levels to suit your tastes and your age group.

So, any ideas on this? I\'d like to have some input on more
"conventional" attractions (rides, rollercoasters and so on).
Obviously you could do a lot with VR and simulators, but this goes
against some of the ideas behind amusement parks, IMHO.
The attractions should be enjoyed by large groups of people at the
same time, instead of creating artificial cocoons in which everyone
plays alone. This should be expecially true in Vilani culture, I
think, and would be consistent with the rest of Traveller universe,
where VR seems to be largely downplayed.

Also, does anybody know about published supplements (even
non-Traveller one) dealing with this idea? I already have access to a
couple of non-SF theme parks (one for TopSecret and another for Call
of Cthulhu, IIRC), but I\'m looking for SF stuff.

The same mistake is made in First Survey (along with no class X starports and Tech Levels 
assigned to barren worlds and four worlds listed as racial homeworlds when they\'re barren and 
Vland having a population of 2000...)

Expect any errata for First Survey (from whence, I believe, the Milleu 0 data was taken) to be 
about as long as First Survey...

actually, IIRC the talk of using diamond as \'semiconductors\' refers to
using a diamond base for semiconductor substrates to be laid upon, since
diamond has some serious advantages over silicon as far as heat
tolerance, dissipation, etc goes. However, this is half-remembered from a
Sci-Am blurb from a \'couple of months ago\', and as I found out recently my
personal concept of \'A couple of months\' is on the order of two to two
and a half years, and \'a couple of years\' is anything up to ten years ago.

(I went looking up an \'Air and Space\' reference from \'a couple of years
ago\', and found it was from 1986.)

One of the last Challenge issues took up this subject; it had an adventure
that took place in a Virus infested \'playland\' (Someone had lived in
Westchester for that one!)

IIRc (the thing\'s at home and I haven\'t read it in a while) the amusment
park, other than some neato-keano animatronics (now trying to kill the
players :-> was remarkably similar to modern day theme parks: lots of
rides that produce variant gee forces, and games dependent on DEX.

Right.  A good way to look at it is, FF&S is like FF&S from the TNE era. 
NAH will be on creating deckplans...plus some SOM-type stuff, if I recall 
correctly.

A type E class starport is little more than a level area with some landing 
markings (and maybe the Third Imperium version of a roadside cafe/ 
T-Stop/Diner/whatever it may be called in your locality.)  The Incas managed 
that much!

Ce Acatl Corporation is very pleased to submit its entry for the
third ISBA THUDDD Competition:  the CP-5R "Tlaxcala" class Patrol
Cruiser.  Tlaxcala (tlahsh-CAH-lah) was a region of prestellar Terra
noted for its proud warrior tradition; we have attempted to live up
to this reputation with our vessel, a worthy addition to any navy or
corporate security force.

A patrol cruiser must be capable of fulfilling a wide variety of
operational roles.  Chief among these are:

* Commerce escort, customs, and anti-piracy duty
* Search and rescue
* Coordination with larger fleets in system defense and interdiction

The Tlaxcala performs admirably in each of these roles.  In battle,
this vessel is both deadly and tough.  Its primary armament is a
devastating 1.3 gigawatt Thompson-Simmons bay laser, capable of
crippling (or destroying outright) most pirate vessels at
multi-lightsecond ranges.  As short range backup offensive and
point-defense weaponry, two independent 30 megawatt T-S turret lasers
provide that added measure of confidence any ship captain going into
combat desires.  Twin Dohetti sandcasters and tough hull armor let
the Tlaxcala shrug off any fire from the bad guys.  Finally, an
industry standard missile turret designed expressly for this vessel,
linked to an ample missile armory, gives the Tlaxcala the added punch
to deal with larger targets...and a fully integrated master fire
director makes sure those punches land *hard*.  Finally, the standard
crew complement includes four ship\'s troops, to be employed as
escorts during customs inspections, as boarders, or as security
aboard prize vessels.

None of this does any good if you can\'t find the enemy, of course --
and that\'s why the Tlaxcala mounts an advanced active/passive sensor
suite (conforming to Imperial Navy standards) to help you flush even
the stealthiest quarry from cover.  This capability is an important
asset in search and rescue operations as well, as is the
military-grade long-range redundant commo suite -- critical for
coordinating with larger fleets.  If a ship is in the system...lying
in wait for helpless freighters, or drifting with a blown powerplant
and a malfunctioning radio...you\'ll find it in time with the
Tlaxcala.

And get there in time, too.  With a CAC J2 drive, and 4G maneuver
capability, this ship has the legs to get you to the action fast
enough to make a difference.  Fuel scoops and an on-board purifier
let you operate away from civilization indefinitely, for those long
patrols.

The Tlaxcala comes equipped with a two-bed state-of-the-art sickbay,
to handle both routine medical situations while on prolonged duty and
combat-related injuries.  To stabilize more seriously traumatized
patients for transport to a hospital, a 4-person emergency low berth
is also provided.

A minimal 20-Std hangar is provided, but no small craft are shipped
with the vessel.  We suggest a 20-Std fast pinnace, two 10-Std
launches or fighters, or four 5-Std fighters.  Our sales department
will be happy to discuss the options with you, and can provide
assistance in arranging a coordinated purchase plan that suits your
needs.

With all three command crew in large staterooms, and the 21 other crew
in single-occupancy small staterooms, one large and one small stateroom
remain unoccupied.  These can be used by visiting personnel, as additional
storage space, or as briefing rooms.  More rooms can easily be freed up
by imposing double occupancy on some or all of the crew.

Finally, the price of the Tlaxcala is attractively low -- both in
terms of initial purchase price, and cost of ownership.  Ce Acatl
Corporation is committed to full compliance with Imperial and ISBA
standards in ship design and construction, and to the use of
off-the-shelf standard components wherever practical.  This
standardization benefits our customers in two ways: Low vessel unit
cost, and easy acquisition of replacement parts.  Additionally, the
craft can be operated and maintained by any Imperially-certified crew
without special training.

The Ce Acatl "Tlaxcala" -- fast, versatile, powerful, inexpensive.  Don\'t
launch your next patrol with anything less!

***

Designer\'s Notes

The most unusual design element is the bay laser, a bit out of
proportion on this size of ship.  The whole vessel ends up looking
like a mount for this weapon; one might even think of it as a baby
spinal mount.  My reasoning was that for a patrol vessel, having an
extremely powerful main weapon would help end fights quickly, and at
long range -- both highly useful.  Just the deterrant value of a 1.3
GW laser on a vessel this size can\'t be discounted.

The power and reach of the bay laser helps compensate for the 4G maneuver
rating.  Ideally, a patrol cruiser should be fast enough to chase down
any opponent -- but 6G designs left too little room for the other
components I wanted, and also would have involved going beyond "pure"
QSDS.  In the end, I decided that 4G plus the ability to hit targets
at very long range gave the same operational capability -- if your
target tries to run away, you can keep pounding him for quite a while
as he flees at 2G max relative separation acceleration.

I\'ve got an animal encounter coming up in my game Sunday.  When T4 
first came out I noticed, like many did, that you couldn\'t figure out 
how to allow animals attack in their section in Book 1.

I understand that this is going to be fixed (thank God) in 
T4-revised, but I need a stop gap measure until that comes out.

At first, I was goint to use the 8+ system in CT since so much of CT 
and T4 are interchangeable, but low and behold, I\'ve found a better 
stop gap in an unlikely source--TNE.

CT and TNE seem to be diametrically opposed in most areas, but the 
TNE animal system really fits right into the game mechanics in 
T4--better than CT\'s or MT\'s.

I never liked TNE, but I bought all the stuff.  I did appreciate some 
of the thing that they were trying to accomplish in the game, but in 
many instances, the TNE game mechanics are clunky, unweildy, and just 
plain hard to implement in a game.

But, I\'ve always liked the detail they attempted in TNE--it\'s just 
that the extra time you put into rolling that detail was not worth 
the enjoyment you got from having that detail there.

Role playing games are always a ballance between detail and ease of 
play.

But, as a stop gap measure, I suggest the animal system in TNE as a 
good subsititute for T4 until the official rules come out.

There\'s notes for animal initiative, there\'s a way to roll up an 
animal stat, and the bonus from the animal\'s weapon takes the place 
of the skill level.

I really like the notes by the animal weapon types that tell you to 
treat the attack as an armed melee attack, diving blow, strangle, 
etc.   (I converted these melee attack forms to T4 a week or so ago 
and posted them to the TML.  If you want them and didn\'t get them, 
let me know).

I\'m not saying to use TNE as it is.  I\'m saying that there\'s a lot of 
good ideas in it that you can convert over to your game.

I\'m not going to put a lot of effort into it with the new T4 rules 
coming out.  I guess I\'m just going to take Eris\' approach and wing 
it--converting, very unscientifically and non-statistically, over to 
KBv2.0.

If anybody else has an animal encounter they are planning for their 
players, you should look at the TNE rules for inspiration.

i had my group experiance what happens sometimes when the home team
loses.. and riot\'s start involing fan\'s from both teams..... Grav ball
should
be added to T4 as the major sport..... it\'s one of the only games i could
see
in the game... be sides no rules football.... like Blood Bowl...... but we
found
one problem and that was you needed to keep the teams pretty close to each
other so you needed a bunch of high tech worlds close enough to form a
leauge... and then you could have a semi finals...... i haven\'t played much
with the grav ball..games..... i have a list of teams but no names for the
players
yet.... with the PC\'s want info on the current games played i roll a few
dice
to determine the score..... and it\'s purely random.... so even i don\'t know
who\'s
going to win.... the Champion ship!

	This reply really belongs in private e-mail, and I have made a long 
response to Pierre-Louis privately, but I simply can\'t let this vicious 
attack on me go without reply.

	I am not a racist. The Reform Party of Canada, of which I belong to and am 
an active member in, is not racist. This attack on my personal character is 
totally uncalled for, especially as I have never made any kind of personal 
attack on anyone on this list. And I find it hilarious that someone who 
believes in sepratism is calling ME un-Canadian.

	I feel I have said nothing that requires an apology.

	I merely said several times that a discussion of Canadian politics does 
not belong on the TML. I said it before Pierre-Louis had said anything on 
the topic. And when the thread continued, I said it more forcefully. When 
Pierre-Louis tried to \'Travellerize\' the thread, I merely pointed out a 
different view of the Quebec situation - a view that I, and many other 
Canadians, hold. If he wants to continue that particular sub-thread, I\'d be 
more than happy to continue.

	If people feel that I have made inappropriate postings to this list, 
please tell me IN PRIVATE. I invite you to do so. My e-mail address is at 
the top, and bottom, of this message. I wil mention that I did receive a 
few "right on" type comments about my postings, but this is the first 
negative one.

Sylea (Core) - FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

	BMWAG LIC is proud to announce that its new 2-door sports coupe, the 
4502csg will be for sale at dealerships on 120-0030.

	The 4502csg is quite simply the ultimate flying machine. It has the 
fastest acceleration of any grav car for sale to the public in the Third 
Imperium. It has been designed using start-of-the-art grav-racing 
technology adapted for the public skies, but without sacrificing any of the 
luxuries BMWAG cumstomers have come to expect in our grav cars.

	Highlites of the car are the neck-snapping 20.3G acceleration, full 
leather interior, comfortable 12-way adjustable seating for 2, the latest 
version of Sylean Roadgrid technology, and a full 19.5G gravitic 
compensation.
	
	But most importantly, the 4502csg is designed to feel like a sports car. 
Whats the point of 20.3G acceleration if you feel like you are standing 
still. Thats why the 4502csg comes with BMWAG\'s patented Vario-Grav, which 
allows inside pasengers to feel up to 1.0Gs of acceleration within the car 
at full acceleration, and progressively less at lower accelerations.

	BMWAG - The Ultimate Flying Machine.

Yes, that was me -- and not just map and rules, but counters for

    'body' => '  Wasn\'t there an adventure for TNE published in Challenge that was set in
an amusement park?  Or was it in Traveller Chronicle?  Man, I hate having
all but my M0 stuff several thousand miles away.

  Anyway, as I recall the adventure did include robots, including a clear
rip-off of Bugs Bunny(tm) and other cartoon characters, unnamed for
copyright reasons.  Might have some interesting ideas along the lines you 
were considering.

  Amusement parks have an interesting history, actually (my course on
Popular Culture includes a section on them, if you must know where this
info comes from).  They developed in the 19th century as a place for the
new urban middle class to go for recreation.  Most started as just what
the name sounds like - parks.  They were open areas, usually at the
outskirts of the city or by a seashore, and were a green and pleasant
alternative to the crowded, pre-mass transit/automobile inner city.   They
were usually built by mass transit companies, since the traffic to and
from the parks on weekends provided an additional source of revenue on
days when commuters were not going to work.

  Initially, entertainment centered around pastoral activities - you could
walk about and see the trees and flowers, listen to music, participate in
athletic contests, shoot at targets, that sort of thing.  As society as a
whole became more mechanised, amusement parks began to include more of
what we would think of as "rides" - mechanized entertainment.  This was
pushed along by the success of the World\'s Fairs, which often included
mechanized entertainment - the Ferris Wheel debuted at such a fair.

  The modern Theme Park was invented by Walt Disney, who saw a market for
family-oriented entertainment in the post WWII era.  By the 1930s,
amusement parks had largely become meeting grounds for teenagers and young
adults, a place where the new, urban mating rituals that centered on
dating and group activities could be carried out.  By presenting an
operation run by a single company, with activities for younger children,
and carefully designed to remove even the implied threat of disorder or
dirt, Disneyland tapped the growing suburban market.

  The modern theme park is essentially a product of a society that
worships the idea of childhood and the childlike state of being.  It is no
accident that Disneyland Japan is wildly succesful - talk about a
child-centered society that loves the idea of innocence.  Theme parks are
also a largely middle-class phenomena - the prices alone are enough to
keep the riff-raff out.  Theme parks in general, and Disney parks in
particular, strive to create the ideal suburban environment - clean, happy
people, with trash and sewage confined to the tunnels below ground.  There
are no homeless people in Theme Parks, no inter-racial violence (perhaps
because theme park customers are overwhelmingly white), nothing in short
that might be disturbing to the happy middle-class customers.

  Thus, VilaniWorld would say a great deal about Vilani society after a
short visit.  Since my copy of Cogs & Dogs is at home, I\'ll leave the
working out of this question for others.

Ce Acatl Corporation Press Release (20-242.2)

CE ACATL WINS THUDDD SHIP DESIGN COMPETITION

Ce Acatl Corporation is very pleased to have received the first-place
award for its "Tlaxcala" Patrol Cruiser in the third THUDDD design
competition.  Sponsored by the Imperial Ship Builders Association (ISBA),
THUDDD provides a forum for competive ship design among Imperial naval
architecture firms, encouraging design innovation and excellence, and
filling the growing need for advanced, capable ships as our Empire grows. 
As a proud member of ISBA, and strong supporter of continuous improvement
in the shipbuilding industry, Ce Acatl has been an enthusiastic supporter
of the THUDDD competions from their inception.

"We congratulate our competitors for their excellent designs," commented
Arpidol Zilznik, Ce Acatl CEO.  "Any of these ships would be worthy
additions to the Imperial arsenal, or to the security arm of any large
corporation."

*** END OF PRESS RELEASE ***

Back to just me, again.  Now seems like a good time to mention that I\'ll
be handling the THUDDD 4 (May 97) competition, taking over for (and hoping
to do as good a job as) Paul Walker.  Thanks, Paul!  Let\'s have a round of
applause! ...

Anyway, the first step is to decide what ship to do next.  We\'ve just done
two military ships in a row, so it will be a civilian, non-combat-oriented
vessel.  There are two potential classes I\'m considering for May.

The first is a yacht, say 500-1000 dt.  This would be an interesting one,
as I think it would tend to emphasize the descriptive, textual portion of
the design as much as (if not more than) the number-crunching end.  The
downside is that it might prove difficult to compare the resulting pile of
"apples and oranges."  But this does seem to be a strong candidate, and
one that the list expressed a fair amount of interest in last time the
topic of future THUDDDs came up.

The second is an exploratory trader, along the lines of the \'Leviathan\'
from CT.  This veseel would also be in the 500-1000 dt range.  The mission
profile here is long expeditions away from \'civilization\', in search of
new markets and high-value trade items.  This makes the vesel quite
different from the Far Trader we did in February.

I will decide which one of these we\'ll do by Friday evening, 5/2, and
release the RFP over the weekend following that.  Between now and then,
please feel free to comment on the relative merits of the two choices
above, either directly to me or via the ISBA or TML lists (in decreasing
order of preference, in my view).

Things will run a little bit differently for the May THUDDD.  Only brief
notices about the stages in the competion will appear on the TML/ISBA
lists; detailed information will appear on the Web at

  http://www.cinenet.net/users/cberry/thuddd.html

which I think will make things more manageable for everyone.  I\'m working
on an online voting system as well, but that might not be ready before
June.  Stay tuned for more info.  Oh, and if anyone strongly objects to
taking the bulk of THUDDD off the mailing lists, please let me know
ASAP...this way looks better to me, but I\'ve been accused of rampant
web-centrism before. :)

Please put what I say under the "Douglas E. Berry wrote:" bit.  It gets
confusing when you attribute a quote and immediately comment on it, then
print what you\'re responding to.

I was just making the point that since we on the TML often draw upon our
personal training and experience to develop our view of the Traveller
universe, it was interesting to see what people like Joe Walsh, Leonard
Erikson, and Mark Clark do out in the real world.

As for off-topic threads, they tend to die out on their own.  We have never
really needed self-appointed list cops to blow the whistle and announce that
the topic is out of bounds.  The only time in my memory that it got to be a
huge issue was the split between the hard core classic types and the TNEers,
which led to the list split.

Stop taking everything as a personal attack.

 No, it was Harrison; I remember the book - hold on a sec, I
 have a copy, if I can find it... nope, seems to have fallen
 down behind my (cheap IKEA) bookshelves.

 I do remember, though, that it was less a Civil War story than
 a detective story - the Black protagonist was doing an
 investigation of the racist colonel for a secret US Gov\'t
 agency (QCIC - Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?); the colonel had
 been doing some legal but unusual transactions in gold, and the
 facility where the colonel was head of security was a research
 facility where time travel was discovered.  The colonel drops
 back 150 years with the gold and the Sten with the intent of
 changing history; the investigator follows to stop him.  The
 book deals with history badly, but you don\'t notice it, as it
 tends to follow the protagonist at a personal level, rather
 than dealing with the history.

Which is why Regiments in my model are recruited from the same region or
world.  The nine regiments in a Division may be of wildly different stock,
but since they keep seperate housekeeping, they need only interact in the
field, as soldiers.

Well, if the *Imperium* is selecting Army units for deployment from the
planetary armies, one of the main selection criteria is going to be "do they
play well with others?"  The Navy and Marines can afford to be selective..
they have a much smaller real manpower need..  Planetary armies, and the
components that they send into Imperial service, will number in the
*billions.*  If a world is incapable of supplying manpower due to its social
structure (the Virasians of Dlan come to mind.. the can\'t get to heaven if
they die off-world.) then you can bet that that world will help meet it\'s
obligation in some other manner.  Perhaps they would provide funds to raise
an equivilant unit on a world better suited to the purpose, or hire
mercenaries to fulfil their role.

Well, Aslan are something of a moot point since their physical makeup
requires significantly different equipment.

However, there are few human barriers that can\'t be taken care of with
military discipline.  Have a religious objection to mustard?  Fine, but
don\'t bitch about your bunk mate who puts it on his Corn Flakes. (true
story.. this guy was weird in a way I can only aspire too..)  In the Navy
and Marines, intolerance towards another service member due to race or any
so-called "immutable factor" would be met with quick action.  Indeed, there
are racist soldiers who hate blacks, but when it\'s pointed out that the
serve and live with blacks, will say "that\'s different, they\'re *soldiers*"

As for the Army, when units from differing cultures are brought together
there is a chance of friction.  But I look at NATO, and I wonder if the
problem is overstated.  In 1985 I went to Germany as part of Reforger.  We
had a British unit to our north, were being backed unit by a Dutch supply
unit, and were engaing a West German panzer unit to our front.  Four
distinct cultures, three languages, and we were all very patriotic.  What
happened was what always happened.. we got together and traded everything
that wasn\'t nailed down.  Since soldiers never change, I think this will
happen in the far future as well.

Maybe my view is biased by my being an American.. as Bill Murray put it in
"Stripes".. "We\'re Americans! Our ancestors were kicked out of every
civilised country on Earth.. We\'re the United States Army.. we\'re 11-1!"

I\'m used to living in a melenge of cultures.

How consistant is something "pan-Imperial" going to be?  Their are over 1000
different sects of Christianity in the United States, some of which will
come to blows when confronted with one another.  You might be in trouble if
you bunk those two adherents of the Great White Cabbage together, if one is
Corned Beef Synod and the other is Coleslaw, Reformed

   The Imperium controls extra-territorial lands on each world, called
   starports, from which the trade between the worlds is regulated.  In
   my campaign, these starports are granted as fiefs to nobles.  It is
   also possible, of course, for the emperor to own land on a world as a
   private citizen, and to grant such land in fief to one of his nobles.
   In such cases, of course, the noble is bound by the local law. Taxes
   are raised by the regulation of interstellar trade and as tribute
   from a world\'s interstellar armed forces.  Also keep in mind that in
   feudal societies, military service to a lord is usually a mandatory
   condition of any social contract; worlds must contribute to the
   emperor\'s armies.

   You are probably right about it being complex, feudal politics
   usually are. The Imperium does have some rules and regulations:
   slavery is illegal on member worlds, as is use of nuclear and
   biological weapons.  By and large, however, the imperium does not
   maintain much of a presence on most worlds.  There are some notable
   exceptions: the military rule on worlds in the Solomani Rim, Imperial
   reserves, some red-zone worlds, and perhaps some feudal
   technocracies, dictatorships, and oligarchies are under direct
   Imperial rule.

   During the MT years, there was a movement among Trav writers to make
   the Imperium more like a modern European or American regulatory
   bureaucracy.  IMHO, this reflects a lack of imagination and should be
   avoided.  I suggest, as alternatives to contemporary life, that Trav
   use books like "Mote in God\'s Eye" and "Dune" for inspiration when
   making up political structure in the Imperium.

Hmmm... I was lead to believe that nuclear dampers operate by either
weakening or reinforcing the nuclear bonds within the fissile
materials (by increasing or decreasing the number of neutrons released
so that the textbook "chain reaction" necessary to create the
explosion cannot take place).

How would this effect be used to prevent a fusion reaction, which I
believe relies on high pressure/heat?  Are the release of neutrons
essential to a fusion reaction?

The Griswalds in "National Lampoon\'s Vacation".  Just think of all the

It would go a lot deeper than that.  Small theme parks would be
tailored to the history of that world, while larger theme parks would
be built around concepts that perhaps an entire subsector shared.

Just like today\'s Native Americans are still bothered by the concept
of "Cowboys & Indians".  The Pirates of the Caribbean in LA is
currently under review pending statements that the ride is not
"politically correct".

"Amusement" parks aren\'t generally theme-related like "theme" parks,
thereby offering much more flexibility.  IMHO, amusement parks would
be heavier on bone-wrenching rides such as rollercoasters, gravity
rooms, 3D bumper cars, etc. than theme parks, which would concentrate
more on patrons actually interacting with the theme.

Some ideas:

TL12+ materials can allow rides to be constructed with very little
visible structural support, making the ride appear much more dangerous
(ie: compare old wooden rollercoasters with today\'s inverted ones).

Artificial gravity allows many actuators to be done away with and
replaced with gravity plates which move the riders around much more
directly.

Actually, when the term "hole" was first mentioned, the first thing I
thought of was access hatch to the boiler of a steam locomotive.
"I think I can, I think I can, I think I can..."

I /do/ like the idea regarding WHY we haven\'t discovered any other
dimensions yet.  Perhaps Buckaroo Banzai will have to someday travel
out beyond the 100-diameter limit and perform a few experiments :)

That\'s the way I see it-- unless the jump drive generates some sort of
mystical, handwaved form of energy (which I hope it doesn\'t).  AFAIK
Traveller canon claims that the jumpdrive consumes H2 to generate
electrical energy, which is then sent to the jump grid.  How that
energy reacts with the lanthanum that the grid is composed of is a
mystery.  DGP\'s Starship Operator\'s Manual claims that the lanthanum
hull grid allows this energy to interact in some way with the jump
dimension (causing the fabric of space to "unravel").

I don\'t know, but I think so.  I renamed this thread to attract others
so that maybe they can shed some light on the subject.  Once we get a
better idea how people think jumpspace works, we can begin theorizing
on a heat sink dimension.

From the POV of a sentient being with a limited lifespan, I\'d assume
that there would be no perceived difference between solar cells and a
perpetual motion machine.  On the grand scale of the universe,
however, things are different.

Sounds good to me.  The Exploratory Trader would (I think) be pretty
interesting.  However, I think the size it a bit small for the role
envisioned.  I would think the displacement range needs to be dialled up a
bit, perhaps to the 2,000 - 3,000 range.  I don\'t have the Leviathan
adventure here with me, but I seem to recall it being a larger (2000+ ton)
ship, with a significant carried vessel tonnage.  And this was with the
volume-friendly High Guard rules and TL15 technology.

Well, three months ago this would have been a major problem, as I was not
web-enabled.  I don\'t know how much of the TML and ISBA membership are
web-enabled, but I suspect the number is not 100% (in fact, I suspect it is
only about 70%).  I would suggest keeping the THUDD announcements and the
final voting calls/final ship design posts on the TML/ISBA lists.  The
actual design entries don\'t need to go to the TML if the final design
detail list is posted there, of course; who needs to see the same design
twice?  I do like the idea of the web page, and I urge you to "go for it,"
but keep it on the TML/IBSA lists as well.  The more exposure we get, the
better the end result.

I know some folks on TML are less than happy about the large THUDDD posts,
but I would rather read those than have to deal with some of the sillier
off-topic threads the TML has hosted of late.  That being said, please note
that I have not posted a complaint to the TML, as its easy enough to ignore
posts one is not interested in.  And, having been a vocal participant in
some of the big US 2nd Amendment Threads/Flame Wars in the past, I really
can\'t be too judgmental about the topic-habits of others.  ;-)


BTW - regarding the recent THUDDD results:

"Aurelian Industries congratulates Ce Acatl Corporation on their selection

urge the management of Ce Acatl to disregard the dozen bogeys approaching

	Thrust plates work by pushing on the gravitational field of a 
star or similar body (re: Starships, etc.). It may be that the drive 
grabs incoming gravitons, reverses them (so to speak) so they push the 
ship instead of pull it, and hype up their energy (so that each one 
pushes harder than usual). This way, you\'ve got an explanation for:

	1) KE conservation: the ship is being pushes by gravitons, which 
are losing the appropriate energy;

	2) Size increases with thrust: more equipment and power is 
needed to pump the incoming gravitons to higher and higher energy 
levels;

	3) Drive inefficency past the system level: rapid fall-off of 
gravitational strength means less gravitons to work with.

	Well, I have been thinking about taking another look at the
Caligula-class megayacht..:).  However, as you point out, it\'d probably
turn into a creative-writing contest rather than a design contest.

	Unless, of course, we were to come up with requirements for the
Imperial Yacht Match Racing Association Ardunia\'s Cup-class racing yacht.
However, given that we\'d be optimizing for speed and nothing else, I don\'t
think that the design systems provide fine enough resolution for us to
actually compete; we\'d probably all wind up with more or less identical
designs.

[snip]

	I would strongly suggest that we do this one.  They\'d make a better
subject for a _design_ contest, would be fab vehicles for role-playng
purposes, and I\'m planning a campaign based around one for next month
<grin>.  However, there are some details that ought to be thrashed out
first, not the least of which is funding; who\'s gonna pay the bills for
this thing?  Settling this would settle a lot of things, such as the size
questions, right away.

	My take on these "Frontier Traders" (a term which I shamelessly
ripped off from Ross Coburn) is that they\'d be in the 300-500 Td range
(numerous smaller and cheaper vessels will cover more ground than one big
expensive one, or will be easier for little trading ops to afford), pack
some respectable firepower, have wilderness refuelling capability (duh),
reasonable armour, good acceleration, and J2 as an absolute minimum.

	I\'ve come up with some financing ideas:

1) a megacorp owns the ship; PC\'s are employees.  Bad for freedom of play
reasons.

2) a megacorp underwrites expenses, in return for regular trade reports and
the right to inspect logs and flight recorders.  Owners cover purchase
price, maybe financed through the same corp, and get to keep whatever they
make from trade activity.  If they find a good trade route or market niche
they report it to the corp, get a cut, and move on.  Eventually the ship
becomes theirs.  Some impediments to perfect player freedom, but less than
1).

3) normal ship financing rules: however, a hefty down payment would be
required, and interest rates would probably be higher to reflect the
difficulty in repossessing a shp lost in the Wilds.  Speculative trade
would probably be a must here.

4) subsidy from the IISS: as a cost-cutting measure, the IISS will loan
players a ship to go scouting in; they are obliged to scout & report back
periodically, and the sweetener is that they get first crack at new markets.

	Suggestions?

	Oh yes... count me in favour of keeping as much as possible of it
on the list.

	I hear you. I live in Winnipeg, and all that water is bearing down on us 
quick. Already, every town between Winnipeg and the border has been 
evacuated, friends of mine are on 24 hour evacuation alert - not a fun 
scene.

	I did want to ask the list, however, what good 57th century disasters 
might be. We know the Imperium has weather control, so floods, tornados, 
etc. are out of the question.

	But what kind of disaster can threaten a modern, TL-C world? And as a 
bonus, seems really sfi-fiish, yet realistic. I can\'t count how many times 
Star Trek has used ion storms, or gravimetric waves, or whatever. What 
among these would really happen? What can I maliciously threaten my players 
with?

	Whats the 57th century equivalent of the flood of the century? And whats 
the Third Imperium version of a sandbag?

Good questions. The answer lies in what the Imperial Policy is regarding the
use of the \'Army\'.

As Doug Berry notes:

"The Army exists to provide the Imperium with the means to
defend its member worlds, and to conquer hostile worlds during times of war.
The term "Imperial Army" refers to the command and support structure that
allows designated units to operate as a cohesive force, as well as those
combat elements.

Remember that the modern United States Army has over 50% of its combat
assets in either the National Guard or Reserve.  The NG is under state
control, and generally does not answer to the federal government.  They do,
however, accept training and equipment from the Regular Army, and when
called upon to serve, will generally do so.

This is the situation in the Imperium.  The various worlds maintain military
forces for their own defence, and allow a portion of those units to be under
the control of the Imperium in exchange for cutting edge equipment and

Which I have no basic disagreement with. The question I have is what is the
Imperial Policy about recruitment and stationing. Are units stationed on the
worlds where they are raised? If a given world has internal conflicts that
degenerate into armed disputes, does the Imperium expect the troopers in the
army units to fire on their own families? Or does the Imperium have a policy
that, when a given member world degenerates into armed conflict that the
Imperial Army units raised on that world will sit quietly in garrison while
the Marines blast cousin Clem and Uncle Ralph into ash? Or does the Imperium
simply raise troops on one world, ship them off to another and so that local
conflicts do not boil over into the Imperial Army?

I agree that to hold ground, you need the classic grunt, either with spear
and shield or ABD and PGMP. I wonder if the Imperium really considers
holding any given mud ball that important. As long as you can refuel and
jump on; why should any world be occupied? As many on this list ask back
when Independence Day came out, why would anyone by pass the Gas Giants and
the asteriod belt to fight over one planet? Why does the Imperium need to
\'occupy\' any given world if it has access to the rest of that star\'s
planetary system?

	Use optical matter, by TL-13 this should be a mature technology.  Optical
matter is a large number of very small balls, that can be formed into
solids
when two or more wide beam lasers intersect in a volume of space.  I read 
something about this a few years back.  Think of it as being a solid
hologram.
There are of course problems when the user attempts to interact with the
optical matter, when the beam is interrupted.  However TL-13 is really all 
handwaving anyhow.

	Fusion reactions don\'t care about high pressure or heat, per se. That\'s
just the only way we know* of overcoming the strong nuclear force enough to
force two hydrogen nuclei (for example) to "stick" together. From the MT
Referee\'s Manual, nuclear dampers "project a series of nodes and anti-nodes
where the strong nuclear force is enhanced or degraded, rendering nuclear
warheads ineffective."

	Now, nowhere in there does it say that it works only on pre-TL8 warheads.
And advanced warheads will be fusion. Even if fission were better (it
ain\'t, that\'s why we even now use fusion warheads), the existence of a
defense which only affects fission warheads would simply mean everybody
would use fusion warheads. Since nuclear dampers work on all kinds of
nuclear warheads, they can affect fusion as well as fission. Hence, there
should be SOME effect on fusion power plants.

	Like I and others have speculated, TL12+ fusion plants will probably RELY
on damper technology for proper functioning. You can rule that a plant\'s
integral dampers, being much closer, pretty much cancel out the effect of
an enemy\'s attempt to shut down the fusion plant with his own dampers at
long range. I\'d rule that at very close range (i.e. boarding range), a
large warship\'s dampers can probably overpower a small power plant. But who
wants to risk his megaton dreadnaught that close to a cheesy free trader?

(*Neglecting cold fusion, and the jury\'s still out on that.)

continue.

still be alive and well in Third Imperium.

	I can see two types of racing in the year 0. First of all would be the 
grand, Paris-Dakar rally type of race. Take your stock scout/courier, and 
the first one to Vland from Sylea wint the race. Secondly, would be 
smaller, shorter time scale track races, either on the ground, air or in 
space.

	How about the Sylea 500, where specially-built grav-cars/ air rafts are 
raced 500 times around Sylea itself.

	I think this would give the hi-tech flavour people were looking for. And 
don\'t forget stock car racing, where the BMWAG 4502csg kicks ass!

	Speaking as a person who\'s getting his BSc in Environmental Geology next 
month, I\'m guessing that with gravitic technology volcano and earthquake 
prediction and control should be very easy to acheive.

	1500mph hurricanes? In worlds with weather control? And plagues or 
predatory swarms are certainly very vicious and nasty, but at least to me 
seem like different types of natural disasters than whatI was looking for.

	Solar flares - now we might be on to something. But I\'m a geologist, not 
an astronomer. Would anyone out there like to comment on just how dangerous 
a solar flare might be? Or is my impressions about solar flares just built 
on bad sci-fi?

	And what about any kinds of space storms, or what-not? Any truth to that?

Yeah, that part makes sense to me just fine.  I also find it totally

OTOH -- I\'m playing the devil\'s advocate here, Leonard; please don\'t take
this as (pure) quibbling -- I\'ve understood the elites of Zhodani society
to be hereditary aristocrats, only some of whom are psionic.  The
determining factor in whether one is a noble is geneological descent, and
in some rare cases, elevation to the \'peerage\' for merit (also requiring
psionic ability, IIRC?).  This being the case, depending on how Zhodani
inheritance customs work, there might be some pressure to limit the number
of children nobles have, so as to stem the progressive fragmentation of
estates and power.  Whereas proles should breed in quantity, so as to 1)
provide more underlings for their betters, and 2) produce by random
combination of genes/mutation/whatever new psionically-gifted individuals
to enlarge the intendant caste.

Which I have no basic disagreement with. The question I have is what is =
the
Imperial Policy about recruitment and stationing. Are units stationed on =
the
worlds where they are raised? If a given world has internal conflicts =
that

Imperium
simply raise troops on one world, ship them off to another and so that =
local
conflicts do not boil over into the Imperial Army?

I seem to recall that in one incarnation of Traveller (MT or T2), forces =
were divided into planetary, subsector, and sector troops.  I liked =
that, as it reflected the political makeup of the Imperium (i.e. local, =
sector and Imperial Nobles - each with increasing responsibility and =
authority.) The following represents _my_ interpretation of the =
Imperium, hope it works with yours!  :)=20

Planetary troopies are the local grunts, training is consistant with the =
world they are recruited from, perhaps with some briefings and/or =
training exercises on integrating with SubSector troops.  The elite of =
these troops might see interplanetary service, garrisoning the other =
planets, moons, asteroids, weapons platforms and navigation beacons used =
by SysDef. In my campaign, planetary troops also serve as a form of =
replacement pool for the SubSector troops. Each unit has a \'brother\' or =
\'sister\' unit that it\'s training is supposed to shadow.  In the event of =
a major conflict, replacements would be immediately available.  (I never =
said they are _good_ troops)

Subsector troops are used at the discretion of the Imperial Barons and =
Dukes.  These troops would be used as Internal Security troops, Counter =
Insurgency and Strike missions and also used to beef up defenses on =
planets with low or untrustworthy (ie. captive government) populations.  =
I think these form the bulk of Imperial military forces, as the local =
command and control appears to form at the subsector level.  If a =
conflict were to embroil a soldiers home world, I can see provisions for =
removing a trooper from certain positions (more from a security point of =
view than any consideration to the individual soldier), but I also see =
where that soldiers intimate knowledge of the planet and/or situation =
would be invaluble.

Sector troops would actually be the Headquarters Units.  These are the =
officers and NCOs that are expected to drop into place in the event of a =
major mobilization.  Theoretically, this enables troops from two planets =
that may be having, um..., intense relations to fight side by side.  The =
equipment supplied by the Sector command and control elements would =
allow troops with "non-standard" gear to operate together.  While in a =
perfect world, these would be extremely competent and experienced =
troops, I tend to see this as the haven of the Imperial nobility.


I agree that to hold ground, you need the classic grunt, either with =
spear
and shield or ABD and PGMP. I wonder if the Imperium really considers
holding any given mud ball that important. As long as you can refuel and
jump on; why should any world be occupied? As many on this list ask back
when Independence Day came out, why would anyone by pass the Gas Giants =
and
the asteriod belt to fight over one planet? Why does the Imperium need =
to
\'occupy\' any given world if it has access to the rest of that star\'s
planetary system?

I would tend to see it more as a economic and political reason.  For =
example, Uncle Fred and his buddies decide that Baron Morley\'s taxes and =
his insistance on his rights of "droit du siegnor" are no longer =
tolerable.  A sufficient number of acquaintences agree and they go on =
strike.  Baron Morley responds with what he sees as reasonable =
restraint, and after the survivors stop running, they pull out the =
hunting rifles.  [we will draw a curtain over the progression of this =
insurgency until...] the starport, no longer able to guarentee the =
safety of ships and shuttles or crews, and is classified as Amber or =
even Red.

Now, at this point, off-world commerce slows and then stops.  The =
orbital widget factory, not able to get the raw materials, or workers, =
from the planet, fails to provide the widgets required to build the =
framitz regulators in a factory one jump coreward.  A Corporation begins =
to scream for intervention \'to protect it\'s workers\' (ie. it\'s =
stockholders).   Insurence companies will be notified of the change in =
status of the starport and will begin jacking up rates for starships =
flying that route.  Shipping lines will drop the port as unprofitable or =
jack up their cargo rates to reflect the increase in costs, then again =
to reflect the increase in _risk_.  Captains of Shipping will begin to =
contact their representatives to resolve the conflict and restore the =
status quo.

Baron Morely\'s income - dependent on the planetary GNP and specific =
industries - suddenly takes a nose dive.  Conversations with certain =
influential subsector and sector nobles are certain to follow.  In order =
to meet his obligations, both personal and public, he will be looking to =
_his_ superior and asking for help.

Duke Ellington, Baron Morely\'s liege finds he is obliged to make payment =
from the subsector purse to cover expenses that Baron Morely is no =
longer able to sustain...more attention. =20

On the other side, I\'m sure that there are a number of sympathetic =
nobles (possibly with ulterior motives?) and other factions that will =
try and either 1) intervene on the side of the insurgents or 2) supress =
any Imperial reaction while the conflict resolves itself.  In any case, =
at some point the insurgency either resolves itself, or the Imperium =
steps in to get commerce open.

Hmmm... OK.  Since you only quoted rules to state that nuclear dampers
can affect fusion reactions, I\'ll assume that some handwaving is
necessary here.  I was just wondering if a node/anti-node array could
have any affect on a fusion reaction as we know it today.

BTW, warheads that rely on fission explosions to "initiate" a fusion
reaction could be prevented from detonating by specifically foiling
the fission reaction (ie: the fusion reaction would never need to be
*directly* affected).

 I don\'t think QSDS/SSDS has rules for this(Yet another reason why I still

One problem is that energy is almost free in Traveller. I\'d say that
nuclear transformation is feasible in Traveller were it not for the fact
that transport costs are also incredibly low. Why build a large and costly
nuclear transformation facility with dampers to remove the unwanted
isotopes when some trader captain will haul the raw ore for next to
nothing?

What I meant is "What is your justification for assuming that a
difference in skill or attribute will stop making a difference just
because the levels involved are very high ?"

As an example consider the case of 2 Imperially famous experts on Jump
Field Physics who are attempting to develop a Grand Unified Theory of
Jumpspace (we will say that this is an Impossible test of Physics &
Int).  Both scientists have Physics - 7 but the first scientist is Int 9
and the second scientist is Int 15.  Using a Max DM of +10 both these
people will have an equal chance of success & this seems very
unrealistic to me.  If you drop the +10 Max DM the second scientist will
have a +12 DM (skill 7 + (Int 15/3)) and will have a better chance of
success which seems much more realistic.

Your second point that by limiting the maximum DM to +10 you reduce the
chance of success on Impossible tasks to a believeably low chance is a
good one but this problem could be solved without causing a
believability gap by simply introducing Nearly Impossible at 21+ &
Impossible tasks at 24+.

I don\'t mean to sound too harsh as you are just doing what MegaTraveeler
always did but a Max Dm has always seemed unrealistic & thats why I
suggest you remove it.

There should be a difference because (without getting too technical or
gearheadish) a 1d6 weapon does not blow as big a hole in someone as a
3d6 weapon does.  Maybe on a spectacular success you could add +1d6 to
dammage for 1 to 3 D dammage weapons.

You could just as well play VR with fellow players or even huge gruops
where all inhabitants of the VR universe are real humans/aliens but I
agree, it goes against the general Traveller feel to empasize heavily on VR
etc. Maybe when VR will be cheap and easy to do it will be considered cheap
to citizens of the Imperium. VR might be a short fad for TL 8-10 worlds and
then fade away. Or maybe Imperial culture look at it as a kind of
electronic drug and its users are looked upon as dopeheads today. This
could make for interesting plots where nobles hooked on a particular VR
thing sneak away to low TL planets to get a "fix" and then get blackmailed
by the VR arcade owners.

in testing my own thoughts about ship design.  I still think a second

final designs (though this might reduce some of the idiosyncracy inherent

  As for the next design competition, I\'d strongly prefer the exploritory

You don\'t have to produce everything. A pop 3 TL-13 planet might be
producing space-suit-helmet-visor-cleaning kits at TL 13 and importing
everything else. That is the reason for the +1 on TL roll for low pops. But
I\'d say that your definition of TL works out the same as "the highest TL
locally produced" as canon states.

An important consideration for GMs regarding low TL planets is that they
probably do know A LOT about high tech stuff in the general sense. They
just cannot afford to import it or do not need it. It is very easy to fall
into the TL 3 planet where everybody believs in witchcraft and they haven\'t
realised the importance of germs et c.

I have always thought that nuclear dampers affect only fission. This is
because the material I have (MT "basic" books, TNE, FFS) suggests that
dampers are only used as defenses against missiles, and not as weapons
attacking reactors of other ships. Reason how can they operate on missiles
(which obviously use fusion) and not on reactors is this : the fusion
warheads we use today start the fusion by igniting a small fission bomb.
That is the only way today to start fusion reaction without magnetic
chambers and such stuff (I think). On the other hand, fusion power plants
use some other method than dampers to contain the plasma (superconductin
coils, repulsor fields, wave your hands as much as you like) so they are
not affected by dampers. 

All this is written IMHO.

Figure a typical separation between nearest-neighbor 100m rocks of, oh,
say it\'s 1000 km = 1,000,000 m.  Given 1 g = 10 m/s^2, and a trip time
with constant acceleration, flipover at midpoint, and constant
deceleration of \'a\' given by

  t = 2 * sqrt(d/a), we may derive:

t(2g)  =  447 s =~  7.5 minutes
t(1g)  =  632 s =~ 10.5 minutes
t(.1g) = 2000 s =~ 33.3 minutes

...which just goes to show you how close together things get under
constant thrust of any significant magnitude.

Depends on a lot, most notably (for the ice part) on distance from and
type of the star(s) in the system.  In Sol system, about 50% are rocky,
25% mixed rock and metal, and 25% almost pure metal.  There are no icey
objects in the belt proper; you need to go out beyond Jupiter to find
those.  This is all from memory; I\'m sure someone will correct me if I\'m
far off the mark. :)

> chunks.

I\'ve done a lot of thinking on this; baby nukes are just too useful in
asteroid mining to be outlawed entirely, but obviously you\'d want to keep
them under *very* tight control.  Here are the guidelines I came up with:

(1) Mining nukes are purchased directly from a branch of the Imperial
    government; only licensed, chartered mining firms may do so.

(2) Each mining nuke is a laser-triggered fusion bomb; there\'s no
    fissionable material involved.

(3) Each nuke is a completely sealed system; a self-destruct mechanism
    will melt the internals of the bomb to harmless slag if any attempt
    is made to open or tamper with the device.

(4) The device has an internal clock; detonation can only occur within
    N months of sale.  N is usually 3 to 6, though longer periods
    sometimes are permitted.

(5) The bomb has a minimum countdown period to detonation of two hours.
    During this time it will scream radio warnings of its impending
    detonation over a broadband internal transmitter; these will be heard
    by any radio receiver within about 5,000 km, barring shielding.

(6) The bomb will refuse to detonate in a g-field greater than 0.01 gee,
    or in an atmosphere thicker than 0.01 bar.  Experiencing either of
    these at *any point* in the countdown will abort the countdown.

(7) The bomb will listen for either of two coded override signals.
    One is given to the purchaser and will cancel a pending detonation.
    One is retained by Imperial authorities and will cause the device to
    do the safe self-destruct described above.

(8) Just before detonation, the bomb must receive a final \'go\' signal
    by radio to confirm detonation.  This helps foil attempts to shield
    the signals in (5) and (7).

Together, these prevent most uses of mining bombs for terrorist purposes.
Comments, anyone?

 Don\'t forget that radar tapers of at the inverse of range^4. Ten times the

It has to be stolen close to the use time.

Shielding (see 8).

Shielding (see 8).

A small timed radio transmitter placed within the shielding.

I think terrorists could probably use it, but they would have to be
pretty good at what they do.

On other problem with (8), if the legal owner is going to blow an
asteroid with very high metal content that metal might shield the bomb
from the signal.

Could you explain more about optical matter?  is this some kind of
material where the lasers temporarily weld the beads together and then
unweld them in some way to change the image? 

As for TL 13 Holodynamic controls, how about metallic (or plastic) dust
and carefully controlled gravitic fields?  The fields would shape the dust
or beads into a variety of shapes, levers, buttons... 

Comments?

Yes. They have an extraterritoriality fence around it to keep people
wandering in and out without customs checks etc. There\'s a starport
detailed in one of the earlier Journals that describes them. BTW the fences
are called extrality fence for short.

Out of curiosity, where actually did you read about those solid holograms?
I\'ve read about such things in Marvel Comics but never elsewhere.

Actually, Ace of Aces works for multiple plane combat quite well; you just
have to use markers in the book for each aircraft you are combatting. It 
gets very slow and complicated the more planes you have, but for 4-6
players (2 to 3 on a side) it\'s quite playable and fun!

From _The Millenial Project_ by Marshal T. Savage

In our asteroid belt, "there are 10 billion (10,000,000,000) asteroids
larger than 100 m diameter.  99.9% of these are between 100 meters and 25
km in diameter.... Altogether they amount to only 10% the mass of
Ceres."..."The 32 largest asteroids are each more than 200 km in diameter.
"  Also, the total mass of the belt is around 0.3% (ie 1/300th) of the
mass of Earth.

Unknown, but the belt ranges from 300 million km to around 600 million km
from the sun, so we have a hell of a lot of space to play with (I also
believe the belt is around 5-10 million km thick). 

With 10 billion asteroids in the belt we have asteroids an average of
maybe 90,000 km apart (maybe more like 30-40,000 km apart in the densest
sections of the belt.  not too far, but far from close.

I\'d imagine that as long as they were clean (ie non-radioactive, low
radiation fusion warheads) and relatively small they would be legal, if
well regulated.  20-50 kilotons would do a good job on most asteroids.

According to legand there were two kinds of Stens, hot ones and cold ones.
A hot one would fire if you even looked at it and naturally a cold one wouldn\'t
fire no matter what.

However if the Sten did have a problem it was the lack of a positive safety.
Being a simple slam fire weapon (ie the firing pin was fixed to the bolt and
fired when it closed) if you dropped it, it would fire. I\'ve herd more than
one 2nd WW vet state that the best way to clear a room was to cock a Sten,
open the door, throw the Sten in and wait. Just imagine that in your average
PC party (wandering round armed like refugees from Pancho Villas Space
Army).

Check out the "Dream Park" books by Niven, Pournelle, and Barnes. There
are two or three, and the first is titled " Dream Park" (in the US
anyway). 

They deal with a not too distant future amusenent oark doing LARPs.
Though mostly *without* robots, but with holograms. Besides the active
players, the big games are shown on the equivalent of closed circuit TV.

D port that was that way. Since you\'ve looked it up, I can change that
to "D or better starport". Ok?

I agree that they might want to avoid "bigots". But "thermally
challenged" types are a different matter. If you are going to invade an
iceball, you *want* the guys that think it\'s only a "bit chilly", and
to invade/garrison Inferno IX, you want the folks who think 130 in the
shade is a cool day.

After all, everything else being equal, you\'ll have about as many hot
world troops as there are hot worlds encountered, and ditto for cold
world troops.

Sure, high tech lets you get around some of these problems to some
extent. But if you had to take siberia in the winter, which troops
would you prefer? Eskimos? Or Arabs? (assuming that they are both
equally good fighters)

Low Pop worlds aren\'t self sufficiemt or anything else. With the
possible exception of some oddball aliens, I\'d say anything under pop 5
(10k) is not "native", but some sort of base. As such the tech level is
that of the "parent" culture, modified downwards by what the locals
commonly *use*.

a hypothetical drive that pushes on large masses. I\'m going to call it
the "pusher drive" from here on.

The time to get to 100 diameters is not excessive (31 hours for a 100
ton *mass* ship, with a 100 MW powerplant).

Planet killer missiles aren\'t practical. You can\'t get more energy out
than you put in.

It gives a *reason* for g-comp to be developed. Because the
acceleration is continuously varying, g-comp, even small amounts helps
passenger comfort a *lot*.

And an unexpected bonus. The pusher drive is much more efficient if
what is being pushed on is *much* more massive than the vessel using
the drive. (for equal masses, you lose 50% of your acceleration, and it
*rapidly* gets worse). But this also means that *large* ships using
thruster missiles can have them push on the *ship*, which is a lot
closer than any planet. This means large ships get higher acceerations
from their missiles and thus, their missiles are harder to hit.

Another corrolary: If you allow the drive to *pull* as well as push,
that means that missiles are accelerating *exponentially* once they get
to the point where they switch from pushing off the firing ship to
pulling on the target ship. Even for small targets, there\'s a point
where the missile gets a *lot* harder to kill!

And this explains fighters. Being so small, missile fire against them
is pretty worthless. But they can get a good boost against larger
targets. 

This opens some interesting possibilities. We need to define the limits
on the drive a bit more. Do you need 100 times the mass to push on?
1000? 10k? A million? Each choice affects tactics.

Even if this is not canon, it\'d be a fun optional drive type.

Solar flares are only a part of the problem. Any massive increase in solar
wind output creates a "magnetic storm" in the upper atmosphere of a planet
or an "ion storm" in space. To a TL12 society, these would more likely be an
annoyance with a few fatalities (like a thunderstorm).

Earthquake prediction can lower fatalilties, but they\'ll probably still
happen; tectonic plates don\'t go away given enough technology. Given that
earthquakes are SDIC phenomena (you can\'t predict them more than a short
time in advance), there will still be panicked evacuations, warnings and
drills. Of course the best place for quake shelters is - in the air!

Toxic outgassing and lake inversions will probably also still happen, though
seldom more than once in the same place. These make living near them a
rather short-term problem. Around volcanoes there\'s always the danger of hot
gases being vented, rather like a couple of events that caused severe damage
here.

In an alien environment, there are always some more possibilities:

If the world has high oxygen or combustibles, atmosphere explosions are a
possibility - a rare combination of innocuous weather conditions cause a
chunk of atmosphere several cubic kilometers in size (or larger) to explode.
Flashfires on the ground are also a problem, especially where non-native
(non-adapted) species are being grown.

Things break, guvnor. Forcing weather into a stable state requires constant
expenditure of energy; what if the computer breaks down or reverses the
effects (but the weather control was the only thing keeping the level of the
Gurshak sea below the dikes!)? Physical dams still break due to age,
earthquake or other causes, and a wall of water you can predict isn\'t a lot
better than one you can. Shielding on nuclear (fusion) plants has been known
to fail; radioactive clouds are a possibility as are catastrophic
explosions. In the ensuing power failures, a lot of infrastructure (ie
weather control) breaks down, which in turn compounds the danger even for
people not near the actual failure. In the constant battle between
Engineering and Entropy, Entropy will eventually win it all...

What would happen if a ship\'s "jump wake" failed to close after it? It\'d be
a one in a trillion accident, but then there are a lot of ships out there.
Then there\'s big rocks falling from the sky - they come in all sizes from
pretty to catastrophe. Comets might release toxic gases into the air as an
added side benefit ("has that comet cyanogen\'ed you yet?"). 

Then there\'s always the organic side of things - swarms, individual
dangerous animals, red tides (or the equivalent), plagues, unfriendly
bacteria outbreaks ... here in Calgary we recently had an outbreak of a
medicine-resistant bacterium that is normally only found in hospitals (!?!)

In essence, find some aspect of geology, ecology, or astronomy, and let it
go wild. Or have something break down and start a chain reaction (see "The
Trigger Effect", episode 1 of Connections by James Burke). And I haven\'t
even begun to think of what could go wrong with psionics...

	Um... how about a bit of rogue dark matter brushing up against its
Oort cloud several millenia ago, causing a massive infall (say 4000 or so a
year) of comets over the next 5-6 centuries?  Aside from the fear of
impact, they\'d leave dust and crap all over the inner system (but boy would
the night skies be gorgeous).

	In passing, how many TML\'ers actually took the time to go outside
and look at Hale-Bopp at its brightest?  Shame on you if you didn\'t; it was
visible naked-eye from downtown Montreal, tail and all.  We\'ll be lucky if
we get another one as good in our lifetimes.

	Other disasters:

* a plague of postings with WINMAIL.DAT cruft at the end,

* the star suddenly deciding to go variable,

* uncontrollable chaoticity in the weather control spiralling into utter
nightmare (you could throw in a Sterlingesque MegaStorm here),

* infestation of the planet\'s oceans by an algae that thinks local
conditions are crumpets and tea, so that wierd things start happening to
atmosphere balance, oxygen content rises, fires start real fast, and so
forth,

* plague,

* a swarm of rogue Von Neumann machines that do nothing but eat regular
matter and regurgitate little plastic statutes of Cleon,

* the macarena making a comeback,

* terrorists taking over the planetwide roadgrid and holding the entire
travelling population hostage (Speed writ large)

* terrorists introducing a virus into a highly religious world\'s net that
causes it to display or transmit nothing but images calculated to to
blaspheme, sacrilege, etc.  The population goes nuts and runs off to a
revival meeting after smashing their communications infrastructure (if not
everything else above TL-0) into bits.  Things Fall Apart.

* a planet-wide soccer or hockey riot (what I want to know is why we
Montrealers riot when the Habs _win_ the Cup; their performance this year
was certainly riotworthy: we should have burned down the Molson Centre).

* a real _bad_ stock market crash or other financial catastrophe that wipes
out 90% of the wealth (say the financial system\'s electronic infrastructure
suffered a massive catastrophic failure that wiped out all non-cold hard
cash money)

* disgruntled power plant employees causing local fusion plant to go boom
(dunno how possible or big a bang this would get you)

* nearby star goes supernova (get out those lead jammies everyone... right
down to the blue-green algae).

	That\'s it for this AM; have to go study.

Energy transitions are always inefficient, right?  If this is so, then there
has to be a huge influx of energy at the gravity plate to 1) capture the
gravitons, 2) reverse their direction, and 3) increase their energy.  Even
with lasar battaries, where does all this energy come from and why is it
more efficiently used in capturing gravitons than, say, standard combustion?

Gravitons, if we buy that they exist as distinct entities, would have
incredibly small mass requiring that the plates be unbelievably dense if
they are attempting to capture them.  This is inconsistent with the use of
these plates for moving "small" objects (like tanks).

I think that treating gravity as a field theory (like magnetism) would offer
a more plausible explanation for the thrust plates.

This is consistent with a "magnetic" style field theory as well.

Same applies to the field theory as the strength of the field diminishes
with the inverse square (?) of the distance from the source of the field.

Stretching my physics background, I understand gravity to work by
"stretching" the fabric of space and creating "wells" which draw surrounding
material in.  Perhaps a Thuster plate creates a "mountain" behind the
spacecraft which pushes material away.  This mountain would be small to
limit the effect on other objects in the immediate vicinity of the craft,
but would create a space-time ripple which would push the spaceship like the
bow wave on a boat pushes a dolphin.  The mountain could be created by
generating a gravitational field with the opposite polarity of the field
created by the local star.  When the two interact, the force of the star\'s
field pushes the mountain away, and, thus, accelerates the spacecraft.

I would guess that this type of field would need to be generated through
some sort of side effect.  Like the way a magnetic field is generated when
electricity is run through a coil.  Using this technique for magnetism, we
have been able to create very light weight, very strong magnets which start
and stop on command.  Perhaps some 4D interaction of electricity and
magnetism would have the effect of generating directed gravitational fields
and include some side effects like gamma rays which we see from pulsars.

Just a thought.

It comes down to economics. If your world has millions of people,
sure, this stuff is easy to monitor. If, OTOH, you\'re talking about
ten thousand people on an outpost at TL 12, that\'s a different 
matter. It\'s not worth the cash to put in all sorts of fancy
equipment to monitor stuff that\'s not likely to occur.

How about a variable star (much MORE variable than Sol is) producing
the "flare of the century" every ... well, century. The stream of
gases interacts in an evil way with something on the planet (either
an animal, plant or chemical). Sounds far-fetched but you could 
expand on it from there.

the ballot for the next THUDDD would be to have people rate the ships on a
1-10 descending scale, _on each mission requirement_ plus one for general
coolosity and innovativeness and another for role-playing potential;so we\'d
have for, say, the last THUDDD something like so:


Wilderness refuelling ability:
Offensive capability:
Defensive capability:
Fleet integratability:
Medical facilities:
Coolosity & innovativeness:
Role-playing potential:



	I think that this would make for a better mapping of conformity to
specs with actual results.

	With regard to the next one, I\'m beginning to think that if we do
the Frontier Trader thing, we ought to leave it as open as possible in
terms of size, drive, and so forth, and base the results on criteria like:


Economic Efficiency (cost, cargo carried, exploratory bang for buck):
Duration (ability to stay in the field for prolonged periods):
Crew comfort (very important on long hauls):
Defensibility (ability to fight/run):
Coolosity:
Role-playing potential:


	So basically, we\'d be able to see how the big-ship exploratory
traders would do versus the little-ship Frontier Traders (personally, I
think that plunking for multiple small ships rather than one big one makes
more sense; fewer eggs in smaller baskets, cover more ground, lower cost,
etc, but I\'ve already said so).  This would let me do something small, the
big-ship guys do something big, and we look at what the list thinks and
learn something.

  The latter part of this statement is false.  The National Guard is 
funded and organized through the federal Department of Defense.  The
National Guard is at the beck and call of the State\'s Governor until
Federal call up is activated.  Then the unit becomes a unit of the
Federal Government.  There is not a thing the Governor can do about this.
This was made clear a few years ago, when several Governors didn\'t want
their NG units to take part in training exercises in Central America.
The Supreme Court told told the Governors \'too bad\'.  The troops went.
  When the U.S. DoD stood down the the 7th Army, the DoD also stood
down the NG units (mostly in New England) that supported the 7th Army.
The Governors protested, as did Congressional members, but since they
wouldn\'t pony up the money to pay for the units, the units stood down.
The states love the NG, it\'s a federally funded work force for the state.
The states don\'t like the price tag, i.e. Federal call up.

   I see Imperial Army units operating in much the same way.

I\'m fairly sure that some official stuff states that high TL nukes are
fusion only, and don\'t use fission triggers. If so I\'d guess they could use
some sort of gravitic focusing and/or laser technology.

Interesting

I\'ve imagined something like that for the antigrav devices. 
I assume that the potential energy increase with altitude(which is not
stupid :-). There is no flat level of potential energy (ie you cannot fall
at constant speed, ie acceleration is never Zero). The antigrav device
interacte/create a flow of gravitons which create a local flat level of
potential energy (a stable point of energy). So just under (around) the
grav device, the acceleration in 0. Side effect : Just under the Zero G,
there is a double G zone! I assume that this devices cannot provide thrust.
But this is totally _my_ assumption. I use Heplar for that.
You could assume that the flat (no decrease) level of potential enregy
could be turned into an increase of potential energy so the ship "fall out
of the massive body"  

1) quite as you,
2) the ability to create isn\'t related to the Gs of a body
3) quite as you (gravitons cannot be created out of G fields)

I have a lot of confusion right now. The design rules from QSDS, SSDS, and
CSC are inconsistent. Jump drive prices differ by an order of magnitude.
CSC has gravitic stacking, which starships do not, and of course the armor
systems are all totally incompatible.

I really really hope FF&S fixes all this, but I fear it will add yet one
more incompatible design sequence. You know what they say about standards -
you get so many to choose from.

This claim is just so silly I don\'t know if you\'re serious or not. Look,
hexes or squares are just an abstraction to measure distances. There are
not really big hexes painted on the ground that everything has to move
exactly through the center of. It\'s just as easy to use 90 degree corners
on a hex map as on a rectangular map. Just draw any lines at any angles on
a hex map, the hexes you pass through will estimate the length of the line.
This is true whether you follow curves, straight lines, 90 degree bends, or
zig-zag. This is not true of square grids; if you draw two lines at 90
degrees to each other and count the squares they pass through there will be
more squares orthogonally than diagonally.

>In space combat it\'s not such a big problem but no
>real advantages for hexes either.

I disagree. The problem with rectangular grids is that the distance you
measure with them depend on the orientation of the grid. Put a rectangular
grid over an arbitrary line and count the squares it passes through. Then
rotate the grid 90 degrees and count again. You get different numbers. To
compensate you have to do some arithmetic for diagonals. This does not
happen with hex grids.

>One big drawback for hexes is in 3D. Why
>should one view of the playing surface be square grid and the other not?
>When designing a 3D system please refrain from giving preferred dimensions.

In the proposed 3D space map the XY and YZ planes are different; the hex
map is used for 2D movement and the square grid is used only for vertical
movement. You could use a hex map for both, but it is unnecessary because
you\'ll only use the columns in the YZ map. I liked the hex/square
combination because it made the different dimensions visually distinct, and
in the Z dimension you don\'t use diagonals so the square grid\'s inherent
inaccuracy doesn\'t hurt you. No dimension is "preferred", you could rotate
the ships or the maps by any arbitrary angle if you wanted. They are
visually distinct, though, so you don\'t get them mixed up. I thought this
was a benefit; you don\'t want them mixed up because they measure different
things. I\'m afraid I don\'t see the "big drawback" for hexes in 3D.

>I\'d say hexmaps are here because most RPG are carrying old archaic stuff
>from the bad old wargame days (hitpoints etc).

A lot of good and bad ideas have been tried from the bad old wargame days.
Hex maps survived because they were a good idea. There were square wargame
maps too, they fell out of favor because they didn\'t work as well.

>But as you\'re all free to do whatever you like in your universe by all
>means keep the damned hexmaps.

Why thanks for your permission... One thing that has always irritated me
about square grids is the tendency of designers to line everything up in
them exactly, as if the grid was some kind of law of nature which cannot be
broken. Consider at all the precise 1.5 m hallways in ship deck plans,
regardless of what the hallway is used for, and curved ships sliced into
rectangular boxes only so they can line up with that unalterable grid. Then
look at real building blueprints; everthing doesn\'t line up on some
imaginary grid. When I make a map I just draw the terrain or walls where
they make sense. I only used the hexes later to estimate distances and to
regulate movement.

Thanks for the suggestion, but you can always inscribe a hex map (or a
grid, for that matter) on anything. So what if a wall cuts through a hex?
It\'s only an abstraction.

   Well, you asked for \'em, so here they are.

   Regarding point (1) ---- this drive will in fact conserve Kinetic
   Energy, but I see no advantage to this, since in the real world
   kinetic energy is not conserved generally.  Total energy is
   conserved; kinetic energy is not.  I\'m sounding like a broken record
   here, I know.  But this  conservation-of-KE fallacy is like a weed
   that just won\'t die.  KE is not conserved! Don\'t just take my word
   for it; look it up in any freshman physics book.

   KE-quibbles aside, your system should work fine, but is very
   different from the traditional Trav manuever drive  for the following
   /physical/ reasons:

   a) The traditional Trav drive has a constant acceleration and a
   distance-time equation of D=(1/4)AT^2.  Your drive has a constant
   power-to-mass ratio and yields a distance-time equation of
   D=(2/3)sqrt((P/M)* T^3), where P/M is the power-to-mass ratio.  It\'s
   accleration is /not/  constant.

   b) One aspect of these "pushing" type drives is that they must also
   be "pulling" type drives.  What this may mean is that while pushing
   against a grav field, you may in fact be putting energy into it, then
   when you slow down, or "pull" during your deceleration, you can get
   that same energy out of it.  Your M-drive uses energy during
   acceleration, and produces energy during deceleration.  A real-world
   analogy is an electric car that uses generators in its wheels for
   braking ---- braking the car recharges its batteries.

   If you don\'t make extensive use of canon in your campaign, or if you
   don\'t care about real-world physics for a game, then your explanation
   should work fine, though.

	Actually, the rules I quoted *don\'t* specify fusion reactions, they
specific nuclear reactions in general. From the way they\'re assumed to work
vs missiles at any tech level, it follows that they *must* work on fusion
reactions, because higher TL warheads will be pure fusion.

>necessary here.  I was just wondering if a node/anti-node array could
>have any affect on a fusion reaction as we know it today.

	Sure. In fact, I\'m assuming that\'s how they get fusion reactors to work at
lower temperatures/pressures. If you\'re meddling with the nuclear forces,
you can make the hydrogen nuclei a bit more likely to "stick" together, and
won\'t NEED to bang them together as hard using temp/pressure.

	True. But I really don\'t think we\'re always going to need fission to
initiate a fusion reaction. Even really good super high explosives might do
the trick, or a laser trigger, or gravitic compression, or ... So I\'m
forced to assume NDs affect the fusion reaction. YMMV.

	It\'s simply getting the initial compression/temperature high enough. A
powerful enough chemical explosive could do the same. Or laser triggers. Or
grav compression. So the enemy would be sitting there frantically focussing
nuclear dampers on my missiles, trying to inhibit a non-existent fission
detonator, right up to the point they vaporize him...

	Your choice, of course, but to me the fact that they\'re used as defenses
against missiles at all TLs means they MUST work on fusion reactions. The
reason they\'re not good against fusion power plants is the fact that the
performance drops off rapidly with range. Preventing a 50kT missile from
detonating at 3,000km (keeping the reaction from ever starting) is quite
different than shutting down a 1,000MW power plant at 300,000km (shutting
down an ongoing reaction). Plus, I assume that TL12+ fusion plants USE very
short range nuclear dampers to control the reaction. That explains the huge
jump in fusion plant efficiency at TL12. And a nuclear damper at 300,000km
is not going to be able to overpower a damper at 1m from the reaction.

>All this is written IMHO.

	Ditto here. However, as somebody pointed out, there\'s a published
adventure where a starship repair shop has a built-in nuclear damper to
prevent people from starting up their *fusion* power plant and leaving
without paying. So there is canonical support.

(Snip example)

        Well, a maximum DM is an easy & dirty way of telling the PCs that
seeking extremely high skill levels is worthless. Moreover, If Skill-5 is an
expert, then there should be not much difference between Skill-10 and
Skill-11. The most playable way to reflect the fact that the level of
expertness becomes fuzzy at the highest levels is to simply put an upper
bound (IMHO).
        Nevertheless, there is a difference between a potential DM of +11
and a DM of +10. Imagine the referee puts a -1 DM to the task, for whatever
reason (confrontation, special circumstances, etc). Then, the first guy
still has a total +10 DM, but the second has a +9.

>good one but this problem could be solved without causing a

>Impossible tasks at 24+.

        Then the problem will reappear at the 24+ level. With a maximum +10,
24+ is Really Impossible: No PC will ever be able to do it. With no max. DM,
there is no Really Impossible task: for all difficulty level, there could be
a PC capable of doing it.

>I don\'t mean to sound too harsh as you are just doing what MegaTraveeler

        I\'m not sure the max DM is unrealistic: Real Real Real experts on
some field are extremely rare, so the problem does no usually appear, and
discourages the PCs from becoming one. And is very difficult to put an order
between the best experts in a field. It\'s easy to assume that an
undergraduate Maths student has a +2 in Maths and a graduate a +3, but
thinking of, say, Gauss and Leibnitz in their time, I would rather think
they both had a +10...

        I am missing something. There IS a difference between a 1D weapon
and a 3D weapon: they do 1D or 3D damage. The point is, for weapons with 3D
or less damage, there is no difference between success and spectacular
success: you cannot make marvels with limited means.

>Maybe on a spectacular success you could add +1d6 to

        This way, there would be absolutely no difference between 3D and 4D
damage: in both cases you will do max 3D damage with success, max 4D with
spectacular success.

Right.  Why not instead find a high-uranium/plutonium asteroid far from
anything else, and quietly set up a mining and refining plant.  Manufacture
of the actual bomb is easy from that point.  Yes, it _is_ highly illegal,
but what isn\'t in the Belt?

Even easier to make \'em yourself.  And a good adventure seed too: "Track
the possibly-shielded high-radioactive sites in the belt and find out
what\'s there.  And try not to stumble across any valid secret military
installations either." :)

I _think_ you\'re talking about a method for manufacturing prototypes.
Under one method, a laser is traced across a pool of semi-liquid plastic
(very small balls in one case), which solidifies where the laser traced.
This solid layer is then lowered into the pool, and another layer is
traced.  This continues, building up a complex 3D shape out of plastic.  

The things manufactured this way are primarily useful as early prototypes
and sometimes as masters for lost-wax casting.  There are other other
similar methods too using layers of paper glued together, for example.

Still, it\'s isn\'t _too_ big of a leap from here to TL12, where you could
posit X-ray lithography on a macro scale, pushing tens of atoms around to
ultimately create macro-scale 3D objects.

The answer depends on your Mileu of choice, I think.  In the Classic
Traveller, 1100 era, I strongly beleive the Imperial Army (as such) does
not exist, except when mobilized from member worlds.  The actual Imperial
Army in peacetime" consists of Corps and Army level headquarters and
support units, which are then filled out with subordinate units activated
from the member worlds.  These formations are then sent wherever needed;
they might have been activated to put down riots on their home world
(unlikely, unless this rioting somehow threatens Imperial perogatives), or
they might be loaded into naval transports and shipped off to fight the
evil mind-rippers or to garrison a planet hard-hit by Vargr raids.  My
reasoning behind this is simple economics; the Imperium in 1100 is too big
to afford or to adequately manage a largely underemployed full-time army
AND a huge navy/marine force structure.

Mileu 0 is a horse of a different color.  The Empire is not very large, and
is culturally and economically dominated by Sylea.  I suspect that in Mileu
0 there is a full-time standing Imperial Army, which used to be the Sylean
Federation Army.  It is probably almost entirely Sylean, and as such is
very homogenous culturally.  I would imagine the other former members of
the Federation of Sylea contributed some units to this force, but their
numbers are likely small compared to the Sylean contribution to the force
pool.  The new worlds added to the Empire since Year 0 may have also
contributed some forces, but not in huge numbers.  GIven the small size of
the new Third Imperium, it would be a much easier task to shift Army units
around to suit cultural needs and political expediency (unlike Mileu 1100,
when the Imperium is just too damned big for this kind of
micro-management).

As for this, the question is really "Why did the Imperium (or whoever)
attack at all?"  If you just want to inderdict a world, controlling the
rest of the system does not prevent the inhabitants of the target planet
from launching (or even receiving) starships.  Laying seige to the target
planet, due to the volume of space involved, requires a HUGE fleet to give
even a 90% guarantee that the planet will not be sending or receiving
ships.  Its cheaper in terms of time and resources to invade and conquer
the planet, and garrison it with inexpensive ground troops, than it is to
surround the planet with an expensive fleet for an extended period of time.

If you want to conquer the world, you have to land and take it.  If you
want to prevent the world from communicating with other worlds, you need to
lay a wastefully expensive and potentially ineffective siege, or land and
take the world (or bomb it into the stone age).  Economics and harsh
reality mean that the groundpounder is just as needed in Mileu 0 or Mileu
1100.

One thing that you haven\'t looked at: decelleration. In principle,
such a drive could decellerate (relative to a planet) arbitrarily fast. 

(which may be OK...but needs to be thought about.)

You haven\'t defined a range dropoff for the drive yet - whether pushing
off the ship helps depends on how you make it scale with range.

I don\'t see why this is true - acceleration (in your basic drive) scales
as relative velocity, not distance; if you\'re closing on the target ship
rapidly, your acceleration goes down.

Think of the losses involved in the vaporized material, not to mention the
material that is rendered unusable from the radiation.  Instead of nukes
to split asteroids, how about Meson guns?  The stresses caused by the
internal explosions should allow a careful operator to peel asteroids like
onions.

Also, it would prevent what, IMHO, would be the most likely terrorist
scenario involving mining nukes.  Not thier direct use on planets or

Anyways, aside from its actual deficiencies, a few comments

I followed the crew calculations from SSDS as closely as possible...
which is to say, it was somewhat reminiscent of a computer game I used to 
play...

"You are in a twisty maze of passages, all alike".

There has really got to be a better way of calculating crew requirements.
This is unusable.

Also, someone asked why I had 38 gunners (a fair question), which was
more than the entire crew of some other entries... so, someone, tell
me where I went wrong here.

20 light & heavy laser turrets   -   20 gunners

Right??? There\'s no automation bonus for gunners, so it
doesn\'t even matter of I\'m low auto vs. high auto - you always
gotta have a lot of gunners. Now, this would give an advantage
to a ship with a big bay laser as opposed to a battery of 10 turrets,
as the bay laser would have 1 (maybe 2, depending if it needs an MFD)
gunner, whereas a battery of 10 turrets requires 11 gunners! Big
difference!

Note that this isn\'t even that heavily armed - I got comments saying
it had "poor weaponry"! Any decently armed ship (that uses turrets)
would easily have hundreds of gunners!

Also, going over my THUDDD notes (and I never even sent in my ratings...
sigh) I see that crew sizes (not counting my ship) ranged from
11 to 29, though I came up with 56!!! Also, most ships were using
standard automation, just like me! What gives??? I\'m also the only
person who listed \'Maintenance\' crew - are they supposed to be rolled into
Engineering?

So, would some other ship designers or you fabulous GDW-beta folks
please set me straight? This is a bit vexing.

Vexed,
Ethan

Yes, I was very pleased at the good showing by QSDS designs.  That 25%

Having worked in the defense industry for six years prior to my current
civilian job, let me assure you that your views on military procurement
are, ahem, rather naive. :)  If the Type 45212 gets purchased, it will be
because

(a) Your yards are in a powerful congressperson\'s -- er, make that
    "noble\'s" -- home turf.
(b) Generica Shipyards hires better lobbyists than the competition.
(c) GS has really good dirt on several key acquisition committee
    members.

Only rarely does technical merit or closeness to specs decide a contract,
given that all proposals generally have the basic general compliance with
minimal performance requirements which my boss at the time called
"answering the mail."

Rather than an immediate second pass through the process, my plan is to
revisit old designs from time to time, months down the road.  Folks would
be free to enter ships from the previous contest into the new one, "as-is"
or with modifications.  The new competitions would benefit both from
hindsight and from any new design systems (or fixes to old ones) made
available in the interim.  I think that idiosyncracy is the single most
valuable aspect of THUDDD, and don\'t want to do anything that will flatten
it out.

I tend to agree on both counts.  Having misplaced my copy of Leviathan
(d\'oh!), can anyone more organized than I please look up the exact tonnage
of that vessel?

My current plans are:

- - Do exploratory trader in May, yacht in June.
- - Make the yacht contest lean more toward creative description,
  deckplans, internal/external views, and other aspects of ship
  design beyond the mechanics of thwapping subsystems into a hull.
- - At the request of many web-impaired list members, continue the
  current pattern of posting designs, ballots, and results to the
  TML, but also make each available on the web for those (like me)
  who prefer that.

All of these are of course open for discussion, at least through Friday
night.

Exactly.  The first rule of security is that there is *no* perfect
security.  Instead, you make the cost of breaching the security (in
required skill, components, logistics, and so forth) so high that it\'s
impractical for any but the best-equipped and best-organized opponent
groups to do so.  Then you watch them *very* carefully. :)

The analogy is to car security.  A determined, highly skilled thief *can*
get past modern door locks, circuit-keyed ignition systems, "Club"-like
steering lock mechanisms, and "Lojack"-type tracers to steal a car.  But
why bother?  The next car over is probably unlocked with a spare key in
the glove compartment.  Steal that one instead, and save yourself a lot of
work.  Similarly, make a mining nuke hard enough to use for terrorism, and
terrorists will (tend to) bypass it in favor of other ways of blowing
things up.

Yeah, the more I think about it, the more I realize that the last-minute
confirmation signal is both too easily spoofed and too easily
inadvertantly shielded during legitimate operations.  Forget that one.

	Some pretty god ones here. But most of them are in the "human error 
category". Its not mother nature taking revenge, but sheer human stupidity. 
I guess I was looking for more natural natural disasters.

	Not that that isn\'t a real concern, As well, human stupidity can also 
effect natural disasters. Here in Winnipeg (where the flood of the century, 
if not millenia is bearing down on us), we\'ve spent millions of dollars 
over the past 50 years building dikes and diversions to ward of floods. But 
just a week ago, provincial engineers realized that the flood water was 
going to do and end-run around the side of the dikes and enter the city. So 
we have the comical (but very, very frightening) sight of city bulldozers 
frantically trying to create a 40km dike in 3 days, that would normally 
take 3 months to build.

Enormous Plume of Antimatter Alters View of Milky Way

By MALCOLM W. BROWNE


  WILLIAMSBURG, Va. -- Astrophysicists announced on Monday that they had
discovered what appears to be a monster fountain of antimatter erupting
outward from the core of the Milky Way.

  They said the discovery would compel them to alter their image of the
disk-shaped galaxy. In the revised image, it is as if a burst of steam were
spurting upward from the yolk of a fried egg.

  The discovery, reported at a meeting here, was made using the Compton 
Gamma
Ray Observatory, a satellite launched by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration six years ago. The four instruments aboard the observatory
detect, measure and record gamma rays: invisible rays that have higher
energies than all other forms of radiation, including X-rays.

  The antimatter was discovered as a result of a series of observations made
by the satellite since last November.

  Antimatter -- a form of matter in which the electrical charge or other
property of each constituent particle is the reverse of that in the usual
matter of our universe -- cannot be directly detected in space. But when
antimatter comes into contact with ordinary matter, the two kinds of matter
instantly annihilate each other, producing gamma rays, which can be detected
by instruments outside Earth\'s shielding atmosphere.

  The newly discovered plume of antimatter rises some 3,500 light-years 
above
the disk of Earth\'s galaxy, which is about 100,000 light-years across. But
even if this cloud of antimatter were to reach Earth, the scientists
reassured their audience, it would cause no harm, because the concentration
of antimatter particles in the cloud are extremely diffuse.

  Moreover, only positrons, are believed to be present, not antiprotons or
entire antimatter atoms. Although forms of antimatter other than positrons
have been created by laboratories on Earth, they have never been
unequivocally identified elsewhere.

  (A prevailing theory is that the Big Bang of creation produced
approximately equal amounts of matter and antimatter, which promptly
annihilated each other, but that a small excess of ordinary matter was 
enough
to create the universe as we know it, with very little surviving 
antimatter.)


  Astrophysicists representing the Naval Research Laboratory, Northwestern
University and the University of California at Berkeley, who collaborated in
the discovery announced on Monday, said the cause and the nature of the
antimatter fountain were puzzling. It might be a more or less continuous
shaft of antimatter streaking northward from the galactic center, or it 
might
be a cloud, separated from the main part of the galaxy.

  Dr. Charles Dermer of the Naval Research Laboratory surmised that the
fountain might be a mixture of gas, boiling away from violently dying stars
near the center of the galaxy, and a stream of positrons.

  When positrons (also called positive electrons) collide with ordinary,
negatively charged electrons, they mutually destroy each other and spawn
gamma rays that have a very specific energy: 511,000 electron volts. The
Compton satellite is able to identify the specific energies of the gamma 
rays
it sees, and the "fountain" was seen by tuning the instrument to the
characteristic electron-positron annihilation energy.

  It has long been known that Earth\'s galaxy looks something like a fried 
egg
with pinwheel spirals. Earth lies in one of these spirals, and as we look up
at the Milky Way on clear nights, we look inward toward the galactic center.
But dust and gas obstruct any light from the galactic center, and so
astronomers depend on other types of radiation to deduce the galaxy\'s
innermost structure.

  Earlier gamma-ray observations have suggested that there is an enormous
black hole at the center of the galaxy and that as matter is drawn into the
hole, it is so intensely heated that antimatter positrons are formed.

  This would account for some of the bright gamma rays flowing from the
galactic center, but scientists realized that it would not explain the much
larger flow of gamma radiation coming from the Milky Way as a whole. Even
after a relatively small black hole, dubbed the Great Annihilator, was
discovered fairly near the galaxy\'s center several years ago, there still
seemed to be too few gamma rays to account for all the gamma rays seen by
wide-angle detectors in space.

  The latest discovery, by the six-year-old Compton satellite, could account
for the missing gamma rays.

  Dermer, of the Naval Research Laboratory, described the big feature as "a
fountain of annihilating death from exploding stars." Viewed from Earth\'s
position within a Milky Way spiral arm, the fountain, some 25,000 
light-years
distant, is about 4,000 light-years across and rises some 3,500 light-years
above the disk.

  Asked why the fountain should rise from only one side of the galaxy and 
not
the other, Dermer compared the galaxy to a pressure cooker, in which rising
pressure "from a boiling cauldron of exploding stars" blew off the lid.

  The results of the latest Compton satellite measurements were kept secret
until Monday, when the research team disclosed that their findings had been
submitted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal. Few scientists not
involved in the study have had time to evaluate the discovery, reported here
in the course of a symposium of more than 200 astrophysicists specializing 
in
gamma ray research.

  Although none of the scientists here questioned the existence of the
"annihilation fountain" suggested by the satellite\'s measurements, much
debate is expected concerning the origin of the fountain\'s positrons.

  Positrons can be produced by heated gas as it spirals into black holes, 
but
there are other ways that the positrons in the fountain may have originated.
The explosions of supernovas and white dwarf stars produce positrons, which
can be generated as well in the slow decay of a radioactive isotope of
aluminum created in such explosions.

  While the galactic fountain emits continuous gamma rays, much more elusive
is a class of objects known as gamma ray bursters: points in the sky that
suddenly emit intense gamma rays for a few hours or days and then disappear.
Because bursters are so brief, satellite controllers trying to track them
have trouble aiming at the right point in the sky quickly enough.

  But several European teams reported on Monday that they had found a
lingering afterglow of radiation occurring after the gamma bursts fade out.
These scientists, using an Italian-Dutch spacecraft called Beppo-SAX,
reported that they had recorded a slowly fading X-ray image of a burster,
which opens the way to studying these enigmas over somewhat longer time
periods. Many astrophysicists believe that bursters are very distant events
in which the collision of neutron stars releases almost inconceivable 
energy.


  Many participants in this week\'s symposium said the universe -- even
Earth\'s general neighborhood of the Milky Way -- was much more violent than
was believed until a few years ago. Dr. Isabelle Grenier, an astrophysicist
at the Saclay Center of Studies, in France, said nearby stellar explosions
could be common enough that their effects might be detected in the
composition of the polar icecaps.

  In another development, Dr. John Mattox, an astrophysicist at Boston
University, announced the possible discovery of a large planet orbiting a
gamma-ray-emitting neutron star called Geminga. Until recently, Geminga was
known only as a mysterious source of very bright gamma rays. But it is now
known to be a tiny neutron star, the surviving cinder of a supernova
explosion 300,000 years ago.

  Geminga, composed of matter so dense that a piece of it the size of a 
sugar
cube would weigh as much as the whole human race, rotates four times a
second. Mattox measured the arrival times of gamma-ray pulses using data 
from
American and European spacecraft alike, and was able to calculate a slight
anomaly that could be explained by the existence of a planet twice the mass
of Earth orbiting Geminga some 300 million miles from the star.

If you allow missiles to "push off" from the ships which launched them,
and at space-combat ranges (!), then you\'ve just blown the rationale for
the 1000-diameter thruster limit (or whatever it is now).

From my archives, here\'s the math which produced some of the now
"canonical" limits on thruster plates, the rationale for it, and the
implications for how large and how close a mass one needs.  Note that the
"flavor text" I submitted was extensively (and necessarily!) edited, but
the math and arguments still mostly hold.

Okay, for the help of those trying to picture the universe alongside the tech,
I\'ve dug up some figures and run some math.

It sounds like people want thruster-plate driven vessels to be able to reach,
say, the orbit of Pluto, some 38.5 AU out.  IF thruster-plates are a gravity-
drive, which work by actually pulling at the curved fabric of local space-
time (which is loopy enough that I like it!), presumably they\'re limited by
that local curvature in their effect.

The Sun produces a gravitational attraction at Pluto\'s orbit of some 405
nano-Gees (that is, about 405E-9 of the pull at Earth\'s surface).  For what
it\'s worth, I thought about using the graviational _gradient_ (dg/dr) instead,
but the figures get fairly absurd: the drop-off near Pluto is about -35
_yotto_-Gees (E-21) per meter, and isolated planets (which I\'ll talk about
in the next paragraph), can\'t even produce that sort of gradient except
within a few millimeters of the surface.  The Sun is a big thing!  :-)

So assume we say that gravity-drive technology won\'t work below a threshold
space-distortion of 400 nG.  An isolated body the size of the Moon would have
a drive-available space around it some 1.1 billion km across.  For the sake
of reference, Marc Miller\'s description back in JTAS 22 or so of jump-drive
as accurate to "one part in a billion" means you can predict jump break-out
to within 30 million km or so, so Moon-size worldlets make acceptable deep-
space depots with which to rendezvous.  Brown dwarfs of Jupiter\'s size have a 
drive-available space of a whole 1.2 A.U. radius (180 billion km), or quite 
comfortable.  And the fuel is free there too....

On a philosophical basis, I do _not_ care for the suggestion that even the
gravitation field of the galaxy should be sufficient for thruster plates
to "grab on" to.  Gimmicks are most fun when they have limits as well as
advantages: anything else seems to me to slide towards munchkinism, and to
shy away from good role-playing opportunities and universe-building chrome.
If we establish such a "magical" drive, let\'s be willing to leave at least
a few problems for our ardent future explorers to face and/or solve.

Here\'s a quick write-up for thruster plates that could be dropped into the
basic starship rules.  I disclaim copyright, remuneration, laurels and wine
women and song, yadda yadda yadda.  If IG likes it, they can have it:

  "Another effect of the TL12 mastery of gravitics (the science of gravity),
   is the so-called \'gravity drive,\' or \'thruster plates.\'  Earlier contra-
   grav technology only negates the effects of a gravitational field: thruster
   plates actually use the field itself for propulsion, by \'grabbing on\' to
   the curvature of space and running along it much like an ant on the slope
   of a sugar-bowl.  Rather than wasting valuable mass by hurling it out the
   rear of the ship, as lower-tech rockets do, gravity drives use the stellar 
   system itself as their reaction mass (much as a train pushes against its
   track, and the planet below, rather than by expelling exhaust).  A small
   change in a star\'s momentum translates to a huge velocity change for the
   much smaller spacecraft, though current gravity-drive technology limits 
   available accelerations to about 6G.

   Unlike the ant of the earlier example, however, gravitic-drive ships move
   _more_ easily the steeper the slope becomes (they can \'push\' more easily
   deeper in the gravity well), and cannot move at all if local space is flatter 
   than about 400 nanogravities (400 billionths that on the Earth\'s surface).
   Gravitic-drive ships thus cannot maneuver in deep-space (empty) stellar
   hexes on the star map, though they can remain there while, for example,
   computing jump parameters.

   Another disadvantage of thruster plates is their gravitic signature: any
   other vessel equipped with gravity-wave sensors can easily detect the
   peculiar emissions characteristic of the system.  Normal telescopic
   sensors are approximately as useful: the \'thruster plates\' themselves
   require radiative cooling, and the bright blue glow emanating from the
   rear of many a new Imperial vessel is, perhaps, more distinctive than
   the subtle space-warp."

Viz. my earlier post about gravitational slope, the gravitational attraction
of a one-million-ton (mass, not displacement) deep-space station would be
above that of the Sun for Pluto out to only a 130 meter radius, which is far
below the accuracy available for jump break-out.  I\'m not even going to try
to calculate the galaxy\'s effect.

So we\'d need to a) allow for vastly decreased performance in "flat" areas of
space, b) assume standard maneuvering thrusters are sufficient for very rare
and slow deep-space maneuvers, or c) allow that it\'s a problem inherent in the
universe (which isn\'t always kind) and that at least some military vessels
have dual drives.

	I figure that\'s part of the handwaving bit; energy from an 
appropriate source is used to generate a field with these effects,. 
Don\'t ask me how; I don\'t actually have a Physics skill. I\'m wokinh off 
of Jack-of-all-Trades 2 here :-/.

	Like I said, I envisioned it more of a field generating unit

	And a damn fine one, at that. I was thinking along similar 
lines, but always thought of gravity being carried on gravitons. Just a 
conceptual difference. One could conjecture that this field worked in a 
manner similar to the original idea I had: reverse the existing field, 
and amplify it.

 No, the Imperium never claimed this; you\'ve missed a nuance:
 The Imperium does not claim _rulership_over_its_member_worlds_;
 merely over the space between them.  Within the limits of the
 member systems, those systems have sovereignty, save only with
 respect to certain aspects of Imperial Law (such as the slavery
 and piracy constraints).  Just like the United States can
 purchase and dispose of land in any of the several states, so
 can the Imperium on any of its member planets.

 Also, I tend to believe that many of the enfeoffments that the
 Imperium grants (your grants of land above) aren\'t really for
 ownership of the land - merely an empowerment to administer
 those lands to the extent that the Imperium requires (e.g.,
 piracy and slavery prevention) and a delegation of authority to
 collect and forward taxes, with a "cut" for the enfeoffed noble.

 This is a little too far in the other direction.  I think that
 the best model to use as a parallel from present-day Earth
 would be somewhere between the Canadian model of Federalism and
 the British Commonwealth of Nations.

There is also Gryphon, which is not very common, but  you will see it.

I did have to decide out how to spell the name,  for a while I was
leaning towards the Gryphon spelling but for some reason, which escapes
me I went with Griffen.  

Because the standard SDB is the Dragon, and one of the RC\'s variants of
the Dragon was the Manticore, I decided to keep with the theme.  I am
making another SDB up, and I have not figured its name out yet. Maybe 
Gorgon, Gargoyle, Medusa or Chimera.

Since it is a local unit until called upon, it would stay on it\'s homeworld
until called on to embark for training or war.

 If a given world has internal conflicts that

Once again, the units are under the control of the planetary government.  If
however, the Subsector Marshall orders the 38th Hillhaven Rifles to restore
order, and they refuse, that is mutiny, and you will see the Marines show up.

Remember, Imperial intervention has a definate "tripwire."  Conflicts
involving NBC weapons, conflicts that threaten to spread to other worlds,
conflicts instigated by other worlds, or direct rebellion against the
Imperium are the only situation where you would see the Imperial Army
mobilize without a request from the planet\'s Noble or government.

 Or does the Imperium have a policy

It would be harder to have have the troops stuck in garrison, hearing rumors
of civil strife, and not being able to do anything.  Even if they are tasked
with simply keeping food moving into the cities, the can help.  You will get
desertions, and brawls between supporters of different factions, but that is
a matter for organic military justice.

Well, food is nice to have.. Also, we need room to walk around, breathe a
little.  Never underestimate the need for victory.  We could have stopped at
the edge of the Rhine in 1945.  Germany was beaten, Hitler was insane.. A
few more weeks and doenitz might have surrendered on his own initative.  Why
risk thousands of lives by pressing the attack?  Revenge.  We wanted to put
our boot prints all over Germany.

Or, as a Desert Storm veteran put it to me:  "After six months in that damn
desert with no booze, we weren\'t going home until we killed someone."

To prove that they won.  also, the economic center of the system will be the
mainworld, and everything is about econmics.. especially war.

Wealthy nobles would certainly raise private forces.  There has never been a
noble in any society who wasn\'t paranoid about his security.  The 4518th
Lift Infantry was special, since Duke Norris had no qualms about letting the
Imperium use "his" troops, first on Efate, later during the 5FW.

No, the Marines are a relatively small force that is lavishly equipped and
superbly trained.  The Marine mission during wartime is to spearhead
planetary invasions.  They don\'t have the heavy equipment (armor, artillery,
etc.) to effectivly garrison a planet.  The Marine advantage in the classic
era was that they *all* had battle dress and plasma weapons.. they were far
better equipped than their opponents.  They are however, limited by their
BD\'s endurance (~100hrs), and their own light nature.

In my plan, each numbered Imperial Fleet has 3 Marine Regiments (w/3000 men
each) assigned to it.  This gives about 10,000 Marines per subsector.

>Perhaps we can divide them into Fleet, Garrison and Line Marines, and 
>admit that Jerry Pournelle influenced CT quite a lot...

See my previous post on the three year rotation that the Regiments go through.

>Subsector troops are used at the discretion of the Imperial Barons and Dukes.

I see the role of the nobility akin to the civilian leadership of the US
military:  The Baron says "go do something about that revolt." and the
Subsector General Staff put together the "package" of Navy, Marine, and Army
assets needed to acomplish the mission with what we military types call
"maximum economy of force" (biggest bangs for the credit.)

  I think these form the bulk of Imperial military forces, as the local
command and control appears to form at the subsector level. 

Since every subsector faces a completely different strategic picture
(compare Jewell and Lunion sometime.. pop, TL, astrography, opposing
forces..) the subsector is the highest peace-time *operational* command.
The subsector is where the manpower needs are determined, equipment is
procured, and strategic goals are set.  Some central subsectors have Paper
Tiger commands.. they haven\'t had need of a real call up in centuries.

Take Lunion for example.  A total pop of around 20 billion, mostly on
Strouden and Lunion.  If .1% of the population is in the military, that
gives us 20 MILLION troops.  Taking the top 10% for Imperial operations
gives us 2 million, or approx. 800 regiments.  The only problem is going to
shipping these guys where they\'re needed!  Since close the 90% of the
regiments will be raised on two worlds, it makes sense to garrison the
worlds closest to the Sword Worlds border with these units, and allow the
other top regiments to remain at home.

If you take the first course, you might as well discharge him.  You\'ve
destroyed his morale.  Ask me how I felt about the United States
immeadiately after my removal from the Army.  You either trust him, or you
don\'t.  It\'s risky, but it pays off.

>Sector troops would actually be the Headquarters Units.  These are the
officers and NCOs that are expected to drop into place in the event of a
major mobilization.  Theoretically, this enables troops from two planets
that may be having, um..., intense relations to fight side by side.  The
equipment supplied by the Sector command and control elements would allow
troops with "non-standard" gear to operate together.  While in a perfect
world, these would be extremely competent and experienced troops, I tend to
see this as the haven of the Imperial nobility.

The Sector command is concerned with the long view.  They plan for the next
century in terms of what\'s going to be needed, and how to get there.

You *cannot* drop in a new command structure at the drop of a hat.  Command
is a thing built on trust.  That trust is built up during training, and
through the contact (at all levels) of daily military life.  The "Sector
Weenies" would probably be mostly staff.. acting as liasons between
subsector armies, coordinating supply, etc.

I kinda like this idea-- very easy to visualize (which is half the
problem sometimes when explaining technobabble).

After all, doesn\'t the current TML handwaving for gravitic laser
focusing mention something about a gravity pulse travelling down the
beam towards the target to maintain the coherency of the beam?  If so,
we already HAVE extremely precise methods of manipulating gravity
fields at range so it isn\'t as far of a stretch...

I agree with you about the army, however I don\'t think it\'s about not being
able to afford it, so much as the unpopularity that the increased taxation
and in obvious Imperial presence would bring. Incidentaly IMO the Imperial
Navy/Marine force isn\'t very big, given the size and wealth of the Imperium.

Not really, all you need are a large number of sentinal satelites
programmed to blow away any ship that leaves the atmosphere without giving
the right ID string. Besides even garrison troops are expensive, let alone
the cost of suppling then during the actual invasion.

You only need to invade if you need the world\'s resources Right Now. If you
can wait then just blockade. Blockades have the advantage that none of your
guys get killed, which is always good for you polical career.

Brilliant! Both for humour value and for actual damage value. In fact, a
computer virus run amok could be both entertaining and dangerous on a
planetary computer network - just don\'t let it mess up your campaign totally
by going interstellar...

You forgot one safety option:

(n+1): The bomb casing is doped with a particular combination of metal
tracers. This makes it possible to tell from the residue which bomb went off
in the event it is stolen.

A group of terrorist with enough chutzpah will manage to steal and detonate
a nuke. Even a "safe" nuke can provide quite the moment of inertia to a rock
in space or a ship in orbit...

The biggest problem with this is trying to get the vector-based maneuvers
into book form. I sat down with paper, time and a lot of head-banging and
decoded the Ace of Aces books, from pages 1 to 223. Dirty little secret -
the game is designed on HEXES, not squares.

I was actually thinking of this as an option, but I am trying to figure out
how to do the vector stuff so that it makes sense in physical (ie physics)
terms...

I thought gravitic laser focusing would work by bending the beam like a
Black Hole does. A strong point source in the lens system should work,
though I suspect you\'d also need a lot of damping aroud it to stop the
\'lens\' wrecking the ship. Maybe that\'s why high TL lasers in FF&S are no
more efficient than lower TL\'s - they need more damping to counter their
more powerful lenses.

Anders, I thought about multiplying but I couldn\'t get the numbers to scale
out the way I wanted.  If you use integers time asset you get a very coarse
scale:  1*14+14; 2*14=28; etc.  Ranges can go up very quickly too.

What, you didn\'t get your copy?  I got mine months ago.  Oh, right, it\'s 
only available to those of us who have the new and improved Computer by 
the Foot (tm), as it\'s distributed in a format readable only by the CbtF 
proprietary FootWrite Desk Accessory. <grin>

Actually, I dunno what\'s happened on the JTAS front.  Last I heard, which 
was a few weeks ago, they had everything ready to go but the art.  I\'ll 
ask Tim on Wednesday and let everyone know what I find out.

Well done Craig. In fact, if you omit rule #5 (radio warning of impending
detonation), the same rules make nuke-pumped X-ray laser missiles legal and
effective for civilian ships. The override signals in rule #7 are
encrypted, of course, so your enemy can\'t deactivate the missiles you fire
at him unless your enemy is a Imperial ship.

I tell ya, stuff like this is why I subscribe to the TML.

There have been several more stories with the same basic plot.  In fact, I
remember a Dr Who Book-RPG with a similar story line.  ;-> For Americans, a
time-branch change at the civil war has always been very intriguing.

Let\'s take Traveller\'s projected timeline...where are the *big* breaks that
could lead to interesting alternative timelines?  I\'ll start...

The aborted attempt to form the Third Imperium.

There is no Cleon I, he fails in his attempt to take the reigns of power
and Sylea remains a Federation.  A wave of isolation sweeps Sylea and other
pocket empires, confederations, and federations fill the void Sylea would
have filled leading to a future with dozens of competing states.

Anybody want to run with this one? ;->

    'body' => 'One of the comments that I occasionally get with regard to KBv2.0 is 
the question, "Where does the 3 come from when you calculate 
experience for KBv2.0," or the mention that, "I don\'t like the 
arbitrary 3."  

I\'d like to address that by saying that the 3 used to calculate 
experience is not arbitrary at all.



What I\'m talking about:

              KBv2.0 target number = attribute + experience

              Experience = Skill x 3



This design is intended to increase the value of a skill and put it 
on par with attribute levels.

I use these definitions:

The Attribute Score gauges the character\'s natural ability with 
regard to a specific characteristic.

The Skill Level gauges the character\'s ability with regard to a 
specific skill.

Skills cover specific areas of interest where as attributes can be 
applied to many different situations.



In a nutshell, what I\'m saying is that, under KBv2.0, a skill level 
is roughly equivalent to 3 levels of a character\'s natural ability.

So, a Skill-1 reflects about the same amount of expertise as does a 
Dex-3.

We can test this.  The attribute score considered to be human average 
is 7.  The average ability skill level is 2.

Under KBv2.0, the character\'s experience in this skill is 6, and 6 is 
just about equal to 7.

Also, the maximum attribute score a human can have is 15.  Skill-5 is 
a very high skill level--and very hard to obtain.

Under KBv2.0, these two numbers are the same:  Attribute-15;  
Experience-15.

When you get above skill level 5, it is like having an ability higher 
than 15.

I\'ve been looking at Carlos\' MT variant task system lately, and I 
noticed that he came up with the same relationship--except, instead 
of increasing the skill level by 3, he is decreasing the attribute by 
3.  Either way, you end up with a 3:1 ratio.



This has just been a thought that occured to me lately, and I thought 
I would post it for any who are interested.

I think 300-500 is a *little*too small, I think.  I\'m looking (for my game

I believe we have just uncovered the reason for the Zhodani core
expeditions.  Obviously Grandfather forgot to turn off his TL 35 matter
/ antimatter converter 300,000 years ago the last time he was at the
core of the galaxy.  He is too busy doing _important_stuff to go turn it
off himself & it is shielded from alteration by robots.  So he jimmied
up a psionic artifact that would prompt the Zhodani to go to the core of
the galaxy & turn it off. :)

I believe your idea was the original one at one point, but the
gearheads on the list determined that it wouldn\'t be all that more
accurate (or something).  Hence the gravity pulse idea that travels
with the laser pulse, maintaining its coherence.  I could be wrong,
however.

        Pan-Imperia Announces Sale of Older Fleet

(Ase, CORE) With the first of the PICH-1/2 "Guppy Class"
Far Traders having proved their spaceworthiness and 
profitability over the last 6 months, Pan-Imperia Shipyards
has announced plans to begin selling off the older ACCH 
"Long John" Class Cargo Haulers.

"With 4 Guppies currently in use showing their ability to be
run profitably and reliably, we have decided that now is a 
great time to offer up these classic ships at bargain prices!"
stated Darius Sadri, President of Pan-Imperia Shipyards and
Servicing and a board member of ValuJump Lines. "The 
Long John Cargo Hauler was the best ship ever to come
out of the AseCon Shipyards when they were in operation, 
and the ships have served ValuJump very well over the years.
Now, we wish to make these ships available to the up and
coming traders who wish to try their fortunes in these 
exciting times of expansion and speculation! No longer must
they stand on the sidelines as the established companies 
lord it about the spacelanes with all their expensive high-
tech toys. We believe that by offering up these valuble
ships to those who don\'t need the bleeding edge, we are 
continuing the fine tradition of opening the spacelanes to
everyone that was the battle cry that led to the formation of
Pan-Imperia."

When asked if ValuJump was merely dumping old and obsolete
ships from its roster, Sadri angrily snapped "Rediculous! These
ships are as spaceworthy as the day they were first laid down.
The fact that ValuJump is still using nearly a dozen in its fleet 
at this moment should prove our trust and faith in the design. Not
one of these ships is over 40 years old. It\'s simply not cost effective
as a company to retain these ships as our own Guppy traders 
come out of the yards. As each Guppy is put into service, a Long
John will become available, no ulterior motives there. If you 
feel you have to find a story, ask our Emperor and his ISBA why
they felt the need to mandate an Imperium-wide freeze on cargo
prices at  1000 Cr? What was wrong with the 4000 Cr  price that
was common along the Sylean Main? What\'s wrong with 
allowing whatever the market will bear? Yet another example
of the ISBA having a mandate to run roughshod over the free
business owners of this sector under the much touted guise
of \'Economics Over All\'. We are just doing our part to bring 
equality back into the equation. These ships are economical
enough that even if they were bought new today, they would be
able to pull in enough profit to make monthly payments, even under
the accursed 1000 Cr ceiling. At the prices we\'re offering them, 
money should be no problem."

                1 Astrogator

Notes: The Long John is typical of the type of small cargo hauler one
might find doing business along the Sylean Main or another string of
Jump 1 planets. The fact it is only capable of Jump 1 as well as its 
totally unarmed state reflect its role as a traveller among the settled, 
more secure planets where Navy or local defense forces have a strong
presence. It is entirely equipped with TL 11 equipment. The command
crew member has a large stateroom, and small staterooms are standard
for the rest of the crew. No passengers are normally carried if a full
ship\'s complement is onboard, and any passengers that might take an
empty stateroom (allowing for a crew member "doubling up" on jobs)
would find a working ship without the amenities they might expect on
a liner.

The price of the Long John is based on what a new ship would cost, and
takes into account the 25% QSDS discount. I imagine these would still
be in production in many places that haven\'t yet been blessed with the
upgraded technology of the Imperium. If using the scenario of a shipline
selling off its older fleet elements, I would imagine the price would 
range from 33-75% of new, depending on age and condition. YMMV.

In figuring the monthly costs of this ship, I assumed Electronics personel
made 5000 Cr/month, Stewards made 3000 Cr, and Command made
10,000 Cr. If the list has decided upon a different standard for pay, my 
employees would appreciate your reply :)

New, this ship would cost 19.37 MCr down with a monthly payment of
403,591 Cr. Salaries would eat 38,000 Cr a month, and fuel/life support/
monthly maintenance/etc. would give a grand total of 508,742 Cr  per
month in expenses. With 2 full loads a month, this ship will bring in 
510,000 Cr, without speculation. This assumes the crew salaries given
above, and that no crew member is doubling up on any jobs; with multi-
role crew members, profits could be better. I use the assumptions that 
a) outside of the Imperium, prices are not as artificially low, b) prices 
were a good deal higher before the 3I, making these a better bargain
when new, and c) at used ship prices, the monthly payments are sub-
stantially lower. The reason this ship is so "basic" is that I wanted to see
if a lower tech ship could still break even in the 3I, my next design will
be based on assumption b above. I am very interested in these old "386"
and "486" designs <g> that are filling up the spacelanes, and I hope y\'all
are too.

Comments much appreciated.

And dealing with that incoming energy is a *bitch*. Someone once built
some buses that used regenerative braking, but since they weren\'t
electric, they had to dump the generated power into a *huge* resistor
(a cast iron grid mounted under the bus). After having to dig a few
buses out of buildings at the bottom of steep hils, and extract the
molten iron grid from the street, this idea died a deserved death. :-)

For starships, it gets even worse!

Try again. Divide *circumference* of the belt (median orbit) by the
number of bodies. That\'s a "minimum average" ditance. For example, a
belt with a 2 AU radius has a 6+ AU circumference. Or about 940
*million* km. So for your "hundreds of thousands" they are more than
10,000 km apart. 

As a "rule of thumb" I\'d say make a calculation like the above and
multiply by 100, to allow for the spread of orbits. At *least* multiply
by 10.

Asteroid belts are only "crowded" by comparison with the rest of the system!

Deceleration should be "reversed" acceleration. So if you are
approaching at a velocity above the velocity you\'d have gotten by
boosting at full power from the planet\'s surface to your current
location, then you know that you will go "splat"! :-)

Ah. I see what you mean. That *is* a factor to consider. Perhaps have
range related to mass. Say by the same inverse cube law I proposed for
calculating the "100 diameter" limits for bodies. Have it not workable
past the "1000 diameter" limit, and we\'ve got things nicely set up.

It was late when I wrote that. I wasn\'t thinking. Duh!

We do? I certainly don\'t know any such thing. Weather control isn\'t
mentioned anywhere that I\'ve seen, and if it was, it\'d have to be
listed as a *weapon*. And if we can have blackouts, they can have
weather control failures.

Well, you can use future equivalents of sebveral *current* disasters.
For example, if that freigter loses power at the wrong time, it\'ll
make a *much* bigger mess than any airline crash! We are talking about
the equivalent of a small nuke, and no easy way to prevent it. 

Besides the usual problems with weather, don\'t forget that a world
that\'s onlyu been colonized a hundred or two years may have a *lot* of
surprizes waiting. Like hidden fault zones that trigger killer
earthquakes. 

Asteroid impacts are a good scare. Even at TL-15, just *try* moving a
big asteroid. At least the traffic control in busy systems will spot
the body in time to try "nudging" it.

But if it is off the traffic lanes, or comes fro some weird direction,
it could get ugly.

I\'m a fan of the "big solar mirrors" bit. You use something like 1/4
mil aluminized mylar sheeting on a *light* framework to make a mirror a
km or so across with the asteroid at the focal point. You melt it down
and then either scoop up molten rock/metal or you play other tricks.

Frankly, with fusion power, you can make a plasma arc "torch" suitable
for carving the rock into chunks. 

Metal asteroids get smelted in any of the many ways that writers have
come up with over the years. The iron is useful for building, most
belter ships won\'t *bother* with the expensive superdense, not when
iron and nickel are so cheap. After extracting the nickel and iron, you
refine the remainder down for most of the non-siderophilic metals.
Things like uranium won\'t be there as it is too fond of silicates.

Stony asteroids get rendered down for silicon and oxygen. Some of the
oxygen goes for life support. Some silicon goes for electronics. But
most go together as silica (SiO2). Glass is *the* most common building
material in any belt, and pretty damned common on worlds in systems
with an active belter subculture.

Aluminum sheets seperated by a layer of foamed glass is a favored
material for walls as it is light, strong, and insulates both temp and
sound. Again, materials from stoney asteroids.

All the siderophilic elements will get extracted from stony asteroids.
Including things like Uranium. 

Carbonaceous Chondritic bodies (chondrites) Are crazy compounds of
carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, etc. These are the *real* bonanzas
in most belts. Those are life support chemicals. Also needed for things
like plastics. You aren\'t likely to find these in belts that are
*really* close to their stars, but they\'ll be in all the others.

In belts that are far enough out you\'ll get ice asteroids. These will
be mostly water, with ammonia, methane and traces of other stuff. These
are *really* valuable, as they are the main source of hydrogen. Not
only is it the fuel for your fusion reactors, and brobably for your
hydrogen/oxygen manuevering jets, but it\'s also needed for water and
other life support chemicals. And hydrogen is the *easiest* gas to
lose.

So the valuable rocks *aren\'t* the metal ones.

Would there be a difference in "natural" gravity and artificial gravity that
one could detect? Would a grav plate be too regular are operate in waves/
pulses or some other means of detecting that one was in an artificial environ-
ment and not on a planet? This has ramifications to an adventure I\'m 
currently working on, so speak up people!

How about a very thin film of mylar/plastic/computer cloth/etc. that is cut to
the dimensions that is required. Being very thin but sturdy, it can be folded/
crumpled into a very small space (much like magicians\' silk hankies). When 
turned on, a static field/magnetic field/whatever goes through the cloth to 
turn it rigid w/ the shape and colors desired for whatever input device is 
needed, e.g. keyboard, touchpad, writing pad, etc. The same piece of cloth
could have several different settings including standard inputs for other
races. It would be hard to use in a stiff wind, but would be good for the indoor
settings we have been debating. And these could be built into the stationary
computer devices as well, instead of a standard keyboard/touch pad you 
would have a flat area covered in this material, thus allowing f\'instince 
shipboard workstations to change their control setups depending on whether
the engineer or the medic is using it, or when the Aslan tech takes over from
the human one.

Ok, my original conception of this thing was as a big sphere, the inside
surface 
of which is lined w/ these radiators. In the center of the sphere is the
"h-singularity" that sucks in the heat the radiators put out. Can anyone
critique
this as a viable design, physics aside?

[Which brings up another question I have been wanting to ask, what happens
to a black hole that doesn\'t have anything to suck in? I know that there is 
always the random scattered atoms in "empty" space, but I am more familiar
with the concept of the hole sucking down the life force of its nearby com-
panion star(s). Does a hole that gets formed out in a relative void just lie
"dormant" except for what it sweeps out of the space around it? How dangerous
would one of these be to our travellers, i.e. how easy/hard would it be to
detect one from several parsecs away if you thought you were jumping into
an empty hex?]

    'body' => 'Hi,

Since I began designing for IG, I\'ve been unable to give my net.rep job 
the attention I used to give it.  The same can be said of Stu Dollar and 
Guy Garnett, both of whom are also designing products for IG.  As a 
result, we decided to resign as IG\'s net.reps as of May 1.

In speaking with Tim Brown about this, he has decided to set up a special 
email box for Q&A type email. He would then have someone at his office 
answer that email.  Since Tim is the production manager for Traveller, 
he\'s the man who always knows what\'s going on, so it makes sense to have 
someone at his office answering product questions.

At any rate, since this is my last day on the job, I thought I\'d get out 
one more Answer.

Folks have been asking about everything on the schedule, essentially.  
Here\'s what I can tell you:

1)  Generally, take the release dates as listed in the IG catalog, and 
advance the next few by a couple of months.  By GenCon, we expect to be 
caught up.  But until then, things will be a bit behind schedule.  Things 
have been improving on that front (remember the dark days of December, 
when they were 4 months behind schedule), and will continue to improve.  
But, it does take time to catch up to schedule.  

2)  By May 15, JTAS 26 and Pocket Empires will be out (they\'re both at 
the printer right now).

3)  Anomalies will be out in late May or early June.

4)  Psionic Institutes will be out by June 15.

5)  Tim has finally received the go-ahead to do Citizens of the 
Imperium.  He\'s coordinating that project now, but is waiting for a piece 
of equipment necessary to the project.  Once everything\'s in place, it\'ll 
go out.

6)  Deluxe T4 is still scheduled for June, but it\'s still a work in 
process (i.e., it\'s being designed right now), so anything can happen. IG 
wants to get it out as quickly as possible (the sooner there\'s a bug-free 
version of T4 out there, the better for their sales of ALL their 
products), but they don\'t want to rush it to press and thereby make the 
same mistake as was made the first time.


News/Rumors/Wild Stories
========================

...Psionic Institutes will be put to turned in to IG this coming Monday...

...The nice folks working on FF&S tell me its coming along nicely...

...IG is in negotiations with Greg Porter for him to make another 
T4 supplement (sorry, no further details are available)...

...The Long Way Home (part 1) is in IG\'s hands, and part 2 (Gateway) is 
in progress...

...Work on the Aliens Hardback is under way...

...Expect the Traveller line to have 3 hardback products by GenCon, if 
all goes well (sorry, again, no further details)...


Signing off for one last time as IG Net.Rep,

 Luckily enough terrorist are almost always adrenalin junkies with no

already as they are fairly easy to steal/make if determined enough and
backed by some  real money as terrorists often are.

I hope everyone understood that these things exist today - not in labs but
commercially available - but in order to use them as the original poster
described you\'ll have to put a diversuit on the operator and keep him in
the plastic soup used as a rawmaterial for the process. Also I\'m shure no
serious article on the subject would describe them as "frozen holograms".

The reason you need a large diameter dish to focus lasers is quantum
mechanical and fundamental. If you put a black holeish thingy in front of
yor laserdish you\'d basically have the same spreading problem but at a
higher cost. The travelling gravity pulse was handwaved to refocus the beam
along its path. Another (siliier) idea would be to put your blackholeish
thingy out midway between you and the target to refocus the beam, This
would also work but if you can put blackholeish things several thousand
kilometers out why not put them inside the bridge of the target ship and
get rid of the laser altogether?

I agree it doesn\'t happen with hexes IF you only measure distances along
the three axes that hexes are correct on. Squares are correct on two
perpendicular axes. Any arbitrary distance will be wrongly measured by both
systems and the big advantage to squares is that they\'re easier to fit onto
normal deckplans ie arbitration on in what square/hex a feature is supposed
to be are less frequent. Count each diagonal as 1.5 and be done with it.

The advantage of squares is that EVRUBODY have them. They\'re everywhere so

I am a bit curious as to why you got so angry about my preference for

Use logarithmic sensorfactors (lots of advantages there) and set the base
figure so that adding ops asset will give you a nice number. My space
combat system posted here earlier will show you how (I can repost or send

I\'d say that gravplates are far less stable than "real" planetary gravity
but that you need a good sensor to design it. Some people (mostly elderly
Californians with crystal earrings and home dyed clothes) say they can feel
the differance and suffer terrible headaches when in artificial gravity
fields. The first floorfield generators were so poor you couldn\'t even play
pool in them as the amplitude as well as angle varied so much that the
balls wouldn\'t roll the way they should but this is long past now.

Black holes evaporate. The smaller the hole, the shorter its life span.
Steven Hawking has done some remarkable theoretical work on this subject.
According to Hawking, black holes are \'fuzzy\', and lose mass over time.

My goodness, if people run this world, there will be all kinds of

Things that go up do come down, dams break, power fails,
construction can be substandard, computers have bugs, operators can
be negligent.  Not everyone in a TL-C world has a college education
and hazmat handling training.  There\'s always some combination of
technology that noone would ever dream of doing intentionally.  At
that TL, someone could punch a hole in the crust from their basement
workshop and noone would even figure out how it happened:  study
Darwin award finalists for some really stupid things people do
today, and multiply it by population and technology increases of the

It could be, but there\'s no fundamental reason why it has to be. Your acceleration

Well, the manufacturing process I described exists today.  It\'s been in use
in the CAD industry since the late 1980s, and in the medical prosthesis
industry since the early 1990s.  The x-ray lithography thing is several TL
leaps ahead of us yet.  

No diver suits are required for the manufacturing process; it takes place
inside a sealed chamber.  But you\'re right, no one would dream of calling
these "frozen holograms."  I have no idea where _that_ came from.

Imagine what you could do with VR if you had gravitics. Strap the audience
down into a spherical VR "ride-theatre" with holographic displays. Gravitic
modules in the sphere could create all the kinetic effects usually missing
from VR: sustained G forces, free-fall, you name it. This would effectively
eliminate the VR-sickness problem, resulting from mismatched signals from
the viewer\'s eyes and inner ears.

Leaving aside VR, gravitic tech provides vast opportunities for relatively
safe amusement park rides beyond anything we\'ve ever seen. Dogfights
between \'space fighters\'. Zero-gravity aerial bumper cars. Aerobatic
sky-diving with grav-belts (as in Somtow Sucharitkul\'s short story, "The
Thirteenth Utopia", or Neil Ferguson\'s _Double Helix Fall_). Lots of wild
possibilities.

Heh-heh.  Isolated black holes _evaporate_.  It\'s true!  Stephen Hawking
made a big stir several years back with the concept, and his theory is the
source of the term "Hawking radiation."  Basically, because of the highly-
stressed space near the event horizon, "virtual particles" are constantly
popping into existence from the vacuum and annihilating each other.  But
once in a while, one of the virtual particles will get knocked in towards
the black hole, which in turn kicks the other out and away, sometimes to
escape.  The black hole has thus suffered a net loss of mass-energy, and
gets smaller.  A black hole actually has a "temperature"!

For stellar-size black holes this process takes a looooooooong time, and
is easily overcome by gobbling up your red-giant neighbor or what have
you.  But the process accelerates the smaller a black hole is, which is
why we don\'t expect to find any Niven-style atomic-size singularities:
they\'d appear white-hot and explode within microseconds!

So Our Heroes could detect a black hole in isolation, more and more easily
the smaller it gets.  I just hope jump breakout near a black hole is rather
further out than 100 diameters....  (Tidal forces!  Eeeeeew!)

Hawking\'s book explains this very clearly (for those of you unfamiliar with
the concept).  Due to a certain constant (Planck\'s?) there is a limit as to
how accurately a thing can be placed in space.  Thus, a piece of matter and
anti-matter could come into existence simultaneously but be slightly
displaced in space and all of the laws of conservation are maintained.  In a
black hole situation, the two elements appear on either side of the "event
horizon" (the point at which things inescapably fall into the black hole).
If anti-matter forms on the inside of the horizon, it falls into the black
hole and eliminates some of the matter there, while the matter drifts off
into the rest of space.  Thus, the black hole gradually looses matter and
effectively "evaporates" spontaneously.  Clearly, this takes a little while.

	Actually, if you have the design, can you send it to me?  I
actually had the rather wierd idea of beginning the next campaign by
telling the players:

	"OK... you walk out of the lawyers\'s office heady with
entrepreneurial ambition and with the papers of your newly formed
exploratory trading corporation in your briefcases.  As your financing was
confirmed this morning, your next stop is Honest Shuuviliikaa\'s Used
Starships lot, where you find the following vessels..."

	Hit them with the specs for a variety of craft, and let them decide
:).  That ought to be good for several hours of intense hull-kicking and
in-character bickering :).  So everybody start doing designs for the THUDDD
right now, OK :)?

	Gravitational force acting on an object m at any distance R from a mass M
(assumed to be point-pass, for simplicity) is

	F=GmM/R^2

Where G is the universal gravitational constant. G=6.67E-11 N m^2/kg^2

	Since F=ma, you then get

	a=GM/R^2

	Note that a N/kg is 1 m/s^2

I don\'t have the relevant data handy.  Check an encyclopedia (or try the
sources referenced by the sci.space FAQ), get the numbers for the formula
above, and plug and chug.  :-)

> How does this vary on a long non-spherical object like a big asteroid?

Try the formula above for different values of R representing the extremes
of the asteroid shape (recall R is _not_ diameter, but distance from the
surface to the center of mass).  The gravity will smoothly vary between
those values as you traverse the surface.

> What\'s the approximate natural gravity on, say, a 1km x 0.5km x 5km rock?

I seem to recall that rocky asteroids are about 5000 kg/m^3 (though that
may be just an average figure for the Earth).  An encylopedia or online
reference could probably give you the proper value.  So multiply that
density by (1000 x 500 x 5000) (need to get meters for our volume) to get
mass, pick your radiii (500, 250, and 2500 in this case), and plug and chug.

    'body' => 'I am reposting the following, because someone asked me to. Apologies if you got it
already. ( BTW, what do the authors of the "rival" mechanics such as KBv2.0 and 
3 Task think ? )

As requested, here goes -

===================================================================================
"VMTTS" (vee-mitts) - VARIANT MEGATRAVELLER TASK SYSTEM FOR TRAVELLER 4TH EDITION, VERSION 1.0
===================================================================================

This system uses 2D instead of a varying number of dice in all cases. 

Roll the target number or above to succeed. Roll less than the
target number and you have failed. DMs are always applied to the die
roll, not the target number. An unmodified roll of 2 is _always_ a 
failure. It is not always an exceptional failure, however ; see below.
There is no equivalent automatic success result.

Difficulty levels remain as per their T4 descriptions. Target numbers are
Easy/Simple 3+, Average/Routine 7+, Difficult 11+, Formidable 15+, Staggering 19+ 
and Impossible 23+. ( In effect, Staggering is old Impossible, and Impossible is now yet one
task level higher still ). The sequence 3-7-11-15-19-23 should be easy to
remember.

Roll two points or more below the target number for Exceptional / Spectacular
failure. Roll two points or more above the target number for Exceptional /
Spectacular success.

Characteristics - only one may modify a given task roll. Characteristics
in the range 6-8 do not modify tasks - they are assumed to be average human ranges.
Apply DM -1 for characteristic 2-5 ( below average human ). 
Apply DM +1 for characteristic 9-B ( above average human ). 
Apply DM +2 for characteristic C-F ( exceptional human ).
Apply DM +3 for characteristic G+  ( superhuman ).

Tasks may be modified in the following ways -

SAFE          - Exceptional Failure cannot occur. Any failure result is
                a normal failure, even a "natural" 2. Mishaps cannot occur.
(NORMAL)      - "Natural" 2 is a 2D mishap. Exceptional Failure and Normal
                Failure are not mishaps.
HAZARDOUS     - Exceptional Failure is a 2D mishap. A "natural" 2 is a 3D
                mishap. Normal Failure is not a mishap.
FATEFUL       - Normal failure is a 2D mishap. Exceptional Failure and
                "natural" 2 are 3D mishaps.

UNCERTAIN     - Referee rolls 1D, player rolls the other. Player can thus make
                educated guess as to outcome.

UNSKILLED OK  - Quoted skill(s) are not essential. If a task is not Unskilled OK,
                and the character has not got the right skill(s), +2 task difficulty levels.
                If the character has a related skill, +1 task difficulty levels. Jack-Of-All-Trades
                may be applied at half possessed level in the place of any
                missing skill.
CONFRONTATION - Both sides roll task - highest modified roll wins. Equal rolls are
                stalemates.

HASTY         - Increase task difficulty level by one. Time taken = Time taken x 0.5
CAUTIOUS      - Decrease task difficulty level by one. Time taken = Time taken x 2.0

Skill level-0 is assumed to be basic, rudimentary knowledge, enough to incur no
Unskilled Penalty. T4 usually assumes that level-0 in a skill means no knowledge -
I prefer the complete absence of a skill on a character sheet to reflect no
knowledge at all, and level-0 to be "green".

I cap skill levels at level 5. Only rare genius can go higher !

Retry attempts can be made as follows -

If previous attempt resulted in ...           Retry task ...

Mishap                                        Not possible
Exceptional Failure                           At one higher difficulty level
Normal Failure                                At same difficulty level

If the character has Jack-Of-All-Trades, he or she can retry exceptional failures
on a given repeated task at no task difficulty penalty a number of times equal to
his or her Jack-Of-All-Trades level. After that is spent, normal penalties start to
accrue.

As with Cautious tasks, there is no Check Determination task for retries in this
system.

T4 is based on a multiple dice "large number system". Some DMs, such DM +9 for
darkness etc are too large to be applied to this system. My suggestion is to rate each
case on individual merit, and scale DMs to -3 through +3 from their original value.

That\'s all folks. I assume you have MT and access to the Mishap tables etc. Let me know
what you think.

	This is one of the things that bugs me about this gravitic
focussing thing.  It\'s just begging the question of what would be the
number of G\'s created have to be in order to keep the beam focussed.

	If it\'s ludicrously high, it means either that either grav
focussing or all the current limits on what can be done with gravitic tech
at the TLs in question is going to have to be revised...

I think the problem with this is that a *long* ballot sheet turns off
participation.
I wasn\'t able to design or vote in the last THUDDD due to time constraints, and
making the evaluation process that much more involved would just limit my
participation even further. While I greatly admire what Dr. Clark is able to do
with his judging, I\'m afraid many of us may not be able to spend as much time
as we\'d like in evaluating the entries.

In the computer game Frontier Elite II, it describes a planet founded by a 
group of devout worshippers set upon by the infamous "Bored Gazillionaire
Playboy With Nothing Better To Do." Spending a vast sum of credits on
satellites, huge hologram projectors, etc. he staged the second coming of
whatever being they worshipped, who then refused to take them with him
due to their leader\'s "unsightlly shave". This then starts a planet wide schism
and civil war between those who thought he meant they weren\'t hairless 
enough, and those who thought he meant they weren\'t hairy enough.

I\'m not a physicist so bear with me. If matter-antimatter pairs are
constantly forming throughout the universe and if the antimatter
part is on the inside of the event horizon, then I can see how the
black hole would slowly evaporate.

However, the matter part of the pair should form inside the event
horizon just as often as the antimatter. So, the black hole gains
mass from the matter half of the pair and loses mass from the antimatter
half. The net result is that the black hole is in equilibrium.

Have I missed something?

Ah.  So some Vilani starship (probably the Vilani version of a free trader
or belter) misjumped into a system just beyond the edge of Imperial space,
and came out of jump inside the 100-diameter limit?  Or did the poor soul
manage to land and repair his ship, only to have the jumpr dirve or power
plant fail catastrophically shortly after takeoff?

What other past events can we blame on Vilani engineering incompetence?
Ezekiel\'s Wheel (Ezekiel got to watch a Lab Ship reenter the atmosphere and
flame out)?  Atlantis (the dreaded .1c chunk of spacecraft flotsam)?  The
Titanic (wilderness sea refueling gone horribly wrong)?

OK, I thought there must be a reason, but I could see it. It\'s just that
the \'bundled pulse\' seemed to involve even more handwaving than a
gravitational lens.

has led me to consider where thrusters fit in. And I thought about Meson 
guns....

Consider the wonderful discovery that Bob Meson made in the Meson
particle. Here is an entity that goes through anything, and "decays" at
a predetermined time and place with catastropic results. CG is
discovered at TL 9 (IIRC), Meson guns at TL 11, and Thrusters at TL
12. Researchers into CG discovered its wave or field type properties
and exploited them, it took Dr. Meson two TLs further in time to isolate
the various gravitic particles and how to harness them. As usual, it was 
used as a weapon before the requisite TL advance to fine tune and
control it for civilian purposes. 

Upon reaching the target, the packet of Meson particles decays into a 
very small black hole type of effect, a "psuedole". The psuedole causes
a very brief but very powerful gravitic pulse that causes an immediate
implosion in the surounding area. I\'ll bet if we question survivors on board
a ship hit by a Meson gun, they\'d tell you the resulting implosion was a
pale electric blue flash. This has the additional result of giving a nice
special FX for the mythical Traveller movie, as it will be nice to have a
gun that instead of exploding incoming fighters, causes them to crumple 
up like a sheet of tin foil first :)

Now, for the drive, the Meson Effect causes either a small psuedole ahead
of the ship that pulls it forward, or more likely an anti-psuedole that pushes
it ahead, thus explaining the pale blue light at the rear of ships. Or maybe it
reacts with the standard gravitic particles to achieve the gun and thruster
effects. I\'m just throwing this theory out at a hectic time, haven\'t had too
much time to evaluate it. That\'s what this mushhead relies on y\'all gearheads
for :) Using the Meson effect for Thrusters also explains why Meson screens
are projected instead of a generalized field; if it was switched on as a field
you\'d loose your manuevering ability.

Well, back to trying to tie all this together with jump space and heat sinks...
I\'ve run it up the flagpole, y\'all start shooting !

I would imagine that there is a difference between generated and real
gravity, but you\'d need fairly good instruments or a lot of time and
careful experimentation to detect it from inside a ship.  Doing tests
over an extended volume would make the process quite a bit easier.  What
I\'d look for:

* Divergent acceleration direction and strength at different points,
  varying by more than could be accounted for on a world\'s surface.
  I\'d look for this especially near the hull, where you\'d get edge
  effects.

* Moderately high frequency and low amplitude oscillations in field
  strength.  It\'s very difficult to get rid of these in AC electronics,
  and odds are that nobody would bother to do so once the noise was pushed
  a couple of orders of magnitude below perceptability.

Hope this helps!

     As you have installed MFDs for the lasers and missiles (I assume), 
you can get rid of the individual gunners for those weapons., That gives 
you a reduction of 24. Otherwise these figures look OK.

     In Starship Assembly Line, I have maintenance crew separate, but 
from memory it takes a lot of equipment to need maintenance crew. I 
haven\'t got starships with me though, so I can\'t give you a definite 
answer. Try running your design through SAL, and see what sort of crew 
you get.

I can dig out my original math from the gdw-beta list, if you\'re really
interested.  I seem to recall that a 1g "annular confinement pulse" did
the trick very nicely, while if you tried the "black hole on the emitter"
trick you ended up forming and/or lugging around a quantum black hole with
a mass in the millions of metric tons and a hellacious output of Hawking
radiation.

A 1g "gravitational annulus" doesn\'t seem to have much weapons potential,
unless you\'re dead-set on screwing with someone\'s solar sail or passive
sensor array....  Hmm....  That\'s how to fix those pesky nobles\' solar
racing derby....  "Dry-fire port laser turret!"  :-)

No, Brett Fishburne\'s explanation was incorrect.  After all, there is no
"matter" inside the black hole to disintegrate: just mass-energy, which
doesn\'t care what form it\'s in (matter, antimatter, photons) since it\'s
effectively inaccessible anyway.

I\'m only an amateur physicist, but I\'ll try to make a bit more sense of
the whole high weirdness here.  The trick is that the particle-pair
production which starts this whole game results from the mass-energy of
the black hole itself and its stress on space.  Normally, a particle and
anti-particle would spontaneously emerge from the vacuum (energy -> mass),
hang around for a short time (read Feynman if you want to know _how_
long), and then annihilate each other (mass -> energy).  We\'re just
swapping around mass-energy counters and no one really minds. 

However, in some cases, one of the particle pair will fall inwards and,
due to conservation of energy, the other will be flung outwards.  Recall
that _both_ were created from the black hole\'s reservoir of energy.  So
even though it "gets" one, it created two -- for a net loss.

   The surface gravity of any planet-sized object is PG = G * R * D
   where PG is the planetoid\'s gravity, G is the earth\'s gravity
   (10m/s^2), R is the radius (or diameter) of the planetoid in units of
   the radius (or diameter) of the earth (1 earth diameter = 8000 miles)
   and D is the density of the planetoid is units of the earth\'s
   density.

   The mean diameter of your rock is the cube root of 1km*0.5km*5km =
   1.4 km.  The diameter of the earth is 12,700km, so R is 0.0001. Let\'s
   say your rock is twice as dense as the earth (D=2), then the local
   gravity will average around PG = G * (0.0001)*2 = 0.0002 G.

   Obviously, any irregular body will have irregularities in its surface
   gravity.  Calculating exactly how certain irregularities will affect
   the mean gravity in certain spots is a very fun, slightly advanced,
   freshman physics problem that is just over the techie threshold of
   this list, IMHO.

   Yup.

   Antimatter does not have negative mass.  It\'s mass and energy are
   both positive quantities.  So whether the black hole sheds matter or
   antimatter is irrelevent; it\'s losing mass either way.

I can think of a problem that could occur, the artificial field begins to
weaken or malfunction causing serious somatosensory problems(i.e. dizzyness,
upset stomach, lack of balance, etc).   You could make it very severe to the
point of incapacitating the passengers or even violent enough to do serious
physical harm.  Just a thought.

You\'re talking about "A Rebel in Time."
I think it\'s by Fred Saberhagen, though
(I\'d check, but it\'s in a box someplace).

You\'ve made a very common mistake -- assuming that antimatter has negative
mass.  It doesn\'t.  Nothing known to science has negative mass.  No matter
which half of a pair escapes the hole, the hole loses mass.

By the way, a stellar-mass black hole would take hundreds of billions of
years to evaporate via Hawking radiation, even if cut off from infalling
matter.

    'body' => 'FUDGEing Traveller: Part 2 - Probability Analysis
=================================================

These probability analyses of FUDGE assume that modifiers are rolled 
using 4dF (4 Fudge dice, -1,0,+1) Other methods of rolling modifier 
levels are given in the FUDGE documents, section 3.22.

The FUDGE curve is centered on 0 (amazingly enough <grin>). Which makes 
it very easy for GM\'s to judge difficulty. The most likely result from 
just a straight throw of dice is 0. 

In FUDGEd Traveller (my version, at least) an Average skilled character 
is therefore someone with an attribute of 8 or 9 and a skill of 2. 
Typical task rolls fall in the Average to Formidible range.

As can be seen in the following table, FUDGEd Traveller holds up 
remarkably well to two popular Traveller Task Systems. Most probabilities 
are within 10% of the other systems for the samples shown. In the cases 
where they differ greatly, it is usually due to, IMHO, an artifact 
(shortcoming) of the other task systems.

I believe that the FUDGEd probabilities are the best for three main 
reasons: (1) Since only one bell curve is used, probabilities are 
consistant. Players can visualize relatively easily differences in Task 
levels, and ability modifiers. (2) Peak of the curve is always set to be 
at the median value. Each GM can determine median and transform to taste 
according to style of game desired. (3) Transformation of the curve is 
consistant and open-ended. Nothing is impossible!

To save time and space, I haven\'t calculated unskilled character 
probabilities or done analysis of spectacular success or failure.

[1] In KBv2.0, Formidible task probabilities more closely match
    Staggering probabilities in FUDGE.  Staggering probabilities in
    KBv2.0 were correlated with Hopeless (+3) fudge rolls.
[2] Before clamouring "Wow, it\'s easy to do impossible things!" remember
    that in KBv2.0, 6D6 and 7D6 are used for these high difficulty
    tasks. This makes the probability for success fall off *rapidly*.
    Be aware that Impossible isn\'t a literal designation. The beauty of
    FUDGE is that it is open-ended. If something is very very difficult
    have the character roll an "Impossible+2" task.

   INTRO
   
      Many people here on the TML have a problem with the Traveller =
4th Edition task system as written. (I don\'t remember hearing one =
person happy with the unmodified version) 

      Kenneth Bearden\'s system, KBv2.0 is an admirable fix which =
changes as little as possible of the system in order to make it =
workable. Ken has succeeded in his task of making the system work, =
but there are still some disadvantages. Namely, lots of dice (meaning =
lots of addition and slower play), big target numbers, and being a =
"close-ended" system like its predecessor.

      Others have advocated a return to the MT Task system, which =
gives little value to attributes. I don\'t think even a modified =
version can be made elegant. Modifying the roll is a little too =
arbitrary, and there is an unintuitive success "scale".

      Glenn Grant has his own D66 system, but I\'m sorry Glenn, I find =
it quite difficult to think in base-6 math. <grin> I\'ve heard many =
other systems come and go on the TML with varying advantages and =
disadvantages. 

      The other day I happened upon this FUDGE thing on the internet. =
FUDGE stands for "Freeform Universal Do-it-yourself Gaming Engine". =
It is a complete, free of charge, role-playing framework upon which =
to build a game. I was immediately struck by the elegance of the =
system, and its complete customizability. Eris and other heretics =
will *love* this system, and I encourage everyone to look into it. =
I\'m sure many of the learn=E9d members of this list are already =
familiar with it.

      I searched past TML archives to see if anyone else has done =
work with FUDGE and Traveller. All I could find was one post by Bruce =
Johnson, who basically just mentioned it. Converting the Traveller =
Task system to FUDGE turned out to be too easy. Even more =
surprisingly, the results seemed to fit nicely with not only the =
current T4 Deluxe task system, but Ken\'s system as well!

   WHY FUDGE?
   
      This document is a compilation of my take on FUDGEing the =
Traveller Task System. I tried to do it in a way that gives similar =
task roll results, and I expect it to easily replace the current =
system with little effort.

      FUDGE task rolls are *very* quick, requiring no addition, =
subtraction, multiplication, or division. (All you do is count the =
dice) It requires only 4 six-sided dice. It is open ended; difficulty =
can be increased ad infinitum. It uses just one bell curve which is =
adjusted for ability and situation. All-in-all, it\'s the most elegant =
and intuitive task system I\'ve seen.

      I am also thinking of FUDGE-related changes to Traveller =
combat, but I will deal with that in a future post. 

      Firstly, I\'m going to cover the legal part...

   ABOUT FUDGE
   FUDGE is a role-playing game written by Steffan O\'Sullivan, with
   extensive input from the Usenet community of rec.games.design.  The

   at ftp.csua.berkeley.edu, and in book form or on disk from Grey
   Ghost Games, P.O. Box 838, Randolph, MA 02368.  They may be used
   with any gaming genre.  While an individual work derived from FUDGE
   may specify certain attributes and skills, many more are possible
   with FUDGE.  Every Game Master using FUDGE is encouraged to add or
   ignore any character traits.  Anyone who wishes to distribute such
   material for free may do so - merely include this ABOUT FUDGE =

   SYNOPSIS OF FUDGE MECHANICS

      There is more than one way to roll the dice in FUDGE, [see =
FUDGE section 4.2 for details] I will deal with the main (and IMHO) =
most elegant one, denoted as 4dF where F stands for "FUDGE die".

      A FUDGE die is a 6 sided die with two red sides (value -1), two =
white sides (value 0), and two green sides (value 1). TRAVELLER fans =
with too many d3\'s can use them D3-2 to give -1,0,+1 values. <grin> =
One can easily take a standard D6 and use red and green markers to =
create the dice.

      Rolling them is simple. Roll the dice, and remove (-1) and (+1) =
dice in pairs until you can no longer do so. Count the remaining dice =
for your result.

      For Example: I roll and get -1,-1,0,+1. I remove the -1 and +1 =
dice and have a result of -1. If you are able to add integers up to =
4, the removal step is optional <grin>.

      FUDGE attributes and rolls are measured on a scale from -3 to =
+3, each level is given a name for ease of description. (eg. my =
character has Mediocre strength but Great dexterity)

      It is a simple matter to convert Traveller Attributes and =
Skills to FUDGE equivalents. The FUDGE levels can be marked on the =
character sheet for future reference using either the level names or =
numerical equivalent. The way I have converted Traveller values is =
shown in TABLE 1. This is by no means the only way, or even the =
*right* way, but it is the way I feel best fits Traveller assumptions.

Explanation
- ----
FUDGE Level: Descriptive level from the FUDGE system.
Pctile: Rough Percentile conversion of attributes. I used this to =
justify my approximation of 2d6 Traveller attributes. (see FUDGE =
section 6.11)
4dF: 4 Fudge dice (-1,0,+1), giving a value ranging from -4 to +4.
Prob+: Probability of rolling FUDGE level or greater on 4DF
Equivalent T4 Task: Traveller task level approximating 4dF roll. Note =
that there is no reason to use these names in a FUDGE Traveller game, =
(just say "Make a Mediocre task roll" or "Roll Superb+1" instead of =
an Impossible task) they are shown here for conversion of T4 =
adventures, or to keep that Traveller "feel".
Traveller Attrb: Attribute equivalent to FUDGE level.
Traveller Skill: Skill equivalent to FUDGE level.

[1] Actual FUDGE name is "Great". I chose to change it to Excellent so
    that the first letter of each name is unique.
[2] No Traveller equivallent at this FUDGE level. I have chosen =
ROUTINE
    as the new Traveller Task name.
[3] The probability of a Staggering Task Roll in Marc\'s revised
    ("Traveller Deluxe") task system is 12%, which puts it between
    "Great" and "Superb" FUDGE rolls. I think that Hopeless sounds
    "worse" than Staggering, so I chose to insert it as a new Task =
name
    just before Impossible. 
[4] Don\'t get discouraged about Skill levels 3+4, 5+6, and 7+8 being
    equivalent. I adjusted the curve to match more closely the current
    Traveller task system. For combat tasks, skills 4, 6 and 8 will =
have
    a bonus for more "graduation" [a future post will explain further;
    if you can\'t wait, see FUDGE section 4.36] 


THE FUDGE-IFIED TRAVELLER TASK ROLL
- ----

      The main alteration that I have made to FUDGE with respect to =
Traveller is its determination of what "trait" to roll against. In =
FUDGE, the GM determines only *one* trait that the player rolls =
against. To keep in better "step" with T4, I decided that in FUDGEd =
Traveller, the player rolls against an Attribute *and* a Skill.

DEFAULT SKILL

      In Traveller, the FUDGE level for someone who is completely =
untrained (ie. no skill) is Terrible (-3), instead of Poor as it is =
in the official FUDGE documents. Traveller Default Skills (ie. skills =
with a possible level-0) can be used at a Poor Level (-2).

UNOPPOSED ACTIONS
    
      To roll a FUDGE Traveller task, the GM sets a difficulty level. =
(Difficult is most common) Roll 4dF and add your appropriate FUDGE =
Traveller Attribute as well as the appropriate FUDGE Skill Level. =
Compare the result with the task difficulty. If it is equal or =
greater than the difficulty, you succeed.

      EXAMPLE:
      Captain Jamison (UPP 879C9A) wants to hack into the local =
public library. The GM decides that this is a Difficult task against =
his Education and Computer skill. Adding EDU 9 (0) and Computer-1 =
(-1) FUDGE levels gives 0. He adds his roll: -1,+1,0,+1 for a total =
of +1. Comparing that to a Difficult task (0) means that he has =
succeeded.

OPPOSED ROLLS

      Sometimes, another player or NPC\'s skills and attributes are =
relevant to the success of the Task. In that case, each player rolls =
against the relevant Skill and Attribute. The results are compared, =
and the higher level suceeds. If the rolls are equal, status quo is =
maintained.

      EXAMPLE:
      Captain Jamison tries to forge a document needed to secure =
passage to a high-law level world. He gives the document to a clerk. =
The GM rules that the clerks knowledge of Law is relevant to detect =
this kind of forgery. Jamison rolls a -1 on 4dF and compares it to =
his Forgery-2 (0) and Intelligence C (+2) for a total of (+1). The =
clerk\'s Law-1 (-1) and Education A (+1) mean that he must roll +1 =
uncover the scam.
      In most situations, NPC\'s attributes and skills will determine =
the level of success required; the GM need not roll for them.

      Opposed roles are important in hand to hand combat. I will go =
over the rules in a future post, see FUDGE documents for details.

SPECTACULAR SUCCESS/FAILURE

      Any unmodified roll of -4 or +4 is spectacular failure or =
success. Also, if any roll exceeds or fails the difficulty by 4 =
levels or more, it is a spectacular failure or success.

      Option: Instead of automatic spectacular success on natural +4, =
treat it as an additional roll. Player rolls 4dF again. If the result =
is positive, he adds it to his previous roll. A final result 4 levels =
greater than the target is spectacular success. This option also =
allows a character to succeed at tasks that are theoretically =
impossible.

      EXAMPLE:
      Captain Jamison is trying to crash land his ship in a hostile, =
windy atmosphere. It is ruled a Hopeless (+3) task, which even if =
successful will result in damage to the ship. Undaunted, Jamison =
rolls a natural +4. Wow! He rolls again with a result of +3! He adds =
+4+3 to his DEX 7 (-1) and Pilot-3 (+1) for a result of +7. =
Amazingly, Jamison manages to land his Free Trader without a scratch.

JACK-OF-ALL TRADES

      To use JOT skill, make a Difficult roll against the skill only. =
If the roll is successfull, add 1 to the skill roll upon which JOT is =
to be applied. If the JOT roll is spectacular success, add 2.

      On a spectacular failure, the character discovers he knows much =
less than he thought, and subtracts 1 from the skill roll upon which =
he applied JOT.

Pandemic disease, such as Ebola filovirus. The characters are stuck in the
hot zone. Planetary defence troops are keeping the panic-stricken populace
from escaping through the cordon sanitaire. Life (while it lasts) becomes
reminiscent of a Joseph Conrad novel...

Vast avalanche, causing a \'long run-out\': a hotly-debated geological
phenomenon in which a massive amount of rock speeds away from the base of
the collapsed zone at amazing speeds - over 120km/hr in some cases. Perhaps
caused by debris floating on a compressed layer of air, or by accoustic
friction-damping (vibration can cause sand to liquify - might do weird
things to big chunks of rock, too), or by partial liquification of the
ground below the avalanche. Long run-outs from at  the edge of the Olympus
Mons plateau on Mars have covered areas half the size of the United States.
This can be bad for your real estate investments...

Vast avalanche on a volcanic sea-mount, causing unspeakably huge tsunamis
on a global scale. This is quite likely to happen when (not if: *when*) the
unstable expansion zone on the coast of Hawaii collapses into the sea.
Could happen any time. Have a nice day!

Catastrophic planetary surface renewal. Analysis of the Magellan Venus
radar mapping data show that virtually the entire planet\'s surface is of
equal age. The whole surface is about 500,000 years old. Venus probably has
a thick crust, preventing heat from escaping from the interior; it builds
up, and builds up, until eventually the entire surface starts to crack
apart and melts into a planet-wide sea of magma. Pretty cool, eh? Sounds
like what happened to the planet Genesis in Trek 3. Happens to Venus every
half-billion years, according to the theory. But this is another hotly
debated phenomenon - some experts think Venus has a thin crust. We await a
penetrometer/seismology mission to find out for sure.

Ice surge. Ice ages don\'t take centuries to get rolling. They can jump into
high gear in a matter of decades, possibly in just a few years! Ocean
levels drop by over 50 meters, exposing the continental shelves. Species
die off in droves. Vast areas turn into cold deserts. Glaciers roll over
the landscape at incredible rates. Skidoo sales boom.

Ocean level rise. The planet enters a hothouse phase. Again, the rapidity
of such transitions can be a matter of decades or mere years. Polar ice
caps become unstable, collapse, and break up. Ocean levels climb rapidly,
gaining 50 meters or more. Vast areas inundated by epicontinental seas.
Humidity climbs to unendurable levels, and everything from clothing to
paper starts to rot. Rain belts sit permanently over the tropics. The price
of galoshes soars.

Volcanic Chorus. One of my favourites, \'cause we might actually be causing
this to happen, any decade now! If the polar ice sheets collapse, this
relieves a lot of pressure on the previously covered ground. The earth
starts to bounce back (it\'s called \'isostatic rebound\'). Magma starts
flowing through newly-opened passages and... BOOM, BAAMMM, KABLOOM! Whole
mountain ranges start to explode into hyperactive volcanism. This has
happened on Earth - fortunately before we came along. Imagine all the dust
being pumped into the atmosphere. The sunsets would be incredibly
beautiful... something nice to look at as you freeze to death.
 
Galactic gas and dust clouds. The Sol system is currently passing through a
sparse gaseous cloud known as the \'Local Fluff\'. Most of it\'s too thin to
notice, but at intervals over next 200,000 years, we will likely pass
through some dense cloud cores. These will suppress the solar wind, and
dust will accrete to solar surface, altering Terran climate - either colder
(by blocking solar infall) or hotter (by stoking the solar furnace), it\'s
hard to say. Maybe the temperature will fluctuate wildly. Time to buy a
good thermostat.

Neaby supernova. A neighboring star goes boom. Radiation might be a
problem. Gravitic shockwaves might have unpredictable effects on the Oort
Cloud cometaries...

Galactic plasma streams. Not terribly likely, even in the timeframe of the
Imperium, but if you\'re playing in the very far future.... The Galactic
Nucleus becomes active, pumping out huge streamers of plasma, some of which
might swoop down across the galactic disc. Hey, you never know...

Spontaneous natural nuclear reactions. A river is eroding its way through
an old mountain range. It\'s sweeping up uranium particles and slowly
depositing them onto the river\'s delta where it empties into the sea. What
a great spot for a resort community - nice beaches, fishing, waterskiing,
scuba diving... Did the colonists bother to do a complete geological
survey? Did they notice those interesting uranium depositions? Will a small
seismic disturbance cause an undersea landslide and a sudden critical mass
reaction? Tune in next week and find out...

Fun universe we live in, isn\'t it?

The military will probably have better security than normal companies

This is a *way* oberworked theme in SF. The *moon* is a satellite.
Satellites "lose orbit" due to air drag (if they are in very low
orbits) or due to some force *pushing* them out of orbit.

With Traveller tech, the only low orbit satellites are going to be comm
relays for phone systems (like the Motorola Iridium system) and they
won\'t make it to the ground. Just about everything else is either
better suited to "high" orbits, or will work ok from them.

So other than the phone relays, the satellites will be in orbits that
are stable for *centuries. And "dead" satellites will be removed or
repaired anyway.

Half right.

We use the heat and pressure to overcome the *electromagnetic
repulsion* between the nuclei. At high temps and pressures, the nuclei
hit hard enough when they crash "into" each other that *in spite* of
the repulsion, they get close enough for the strong nuclear force to
pull them together.

Make the nuclear force stronger, and you can lower the temp/pressure
required for fusion. Make it weaker and you raise it.

Fission has nucleui coming apart, because they are only marginally
stable. Increasing the nuclear force stabilizes the heavy nuclei, and
thus makes fission less likely. Decreasing it make fission more likely.

Grab a copy of the rules governing "12 meter" sailboats. Then try to
figure out something equivalent for use by spacecraft of some sort...

Only trouble is, the energy from decelerating *has* to be handled some
way. And doing so as waste heat *won\'t* work. Do the calcs. You\'ll find
that the ship goes up in a puff of vapor. :-)

I *did* remember the inverse fourth power law. But since I also didn\'t
bother doing any calcs, let\'s just check it out...

1 km x 1 km is 1e6 m^2. And we know that radars can pick up a 1 m^2
target at 150 km. Maybe even at 1500.

dist (km)	signal	a1	a2	a3

  1.5e6		1	1e16	1e12	1e8
150e3		1e4	1e12	1e8	1e4

  1.5e3		1e12	1e4	1	
150		1e16	1
 15		1e20
  1.5		1e24

Hmmm... 1e12 is a 1000 km body. 1e8 is a 10 km body.

Making a fission *or* fusion power plant go "boom" is in the same
league as making a coal-fired power plant go "boom". It\'s *possible*,
but only by taking the fuel and doing things with it that the power
plant *can\'t* do.

Fusion requires heat & pressure to maintain the reaction (or a nuclear
damper in "enhance" mode).

Fission can go on it\'s own, but requires an outside agency to keep the
fissionable material close enough together for *long* enough to go
"boom" (assuming the fissionables are pure enough, only Navy reactors
use fuel that pure). What happens without rather *enormous* forces to
confine the fissioning material is that it develops just enough energy
to scatter the fissionables enough that the reaction can\'t continue.
This is not nice for the people nearby, but it won\'t bother folks more
than a few tens of yards away.

Coal will burn quietly once you get it started. If you divide it up
into a fine dust and aerate the dust well, then you can get it to go
"boom".

These racers should be exempt from the normal minimum AV. They won\'t be
going all that fast, and if a solar flare is detected, the race is
canceled and ships rush out to pick up the racers before the radiation
gets there (solar flares are a hazard from the *particle* radiation,
mostly protons, which move well under lightspeed. Typical lag is
*hours*). Of course, they\'ll have to jettison the sail (ouch! that
ain\'t cheap) so that the rest of the racer can be taken aboard the
rescue ship.

Also, solar sails are great for bulk cargo movement. Simple automated
sail handling gear attached to a frame that canm hold a few thousand
tons of cargo. Maybe as much as a million.

An old time favorite that barely survives nowdays in the "carnivals"
that travel from town to town is the "fun house". High tech offers some
interesting possibilities. For instance holograms can add to the
"haunted house" stuff, and to the "fun house mirror" stuff. Gravity
control can make the old standby of "crooked rooms" even stranger. 

For those not familiar with that last one, they are rooms where the
floor isn\'t level, the walls aren\'t vertical, and they tend to have
things in them that make you wonder just which way *is* down. The one I
remember from when I was a kid had a trough with water flowing down it.
And right next to it a V shaped trough with big steel balls rolling in
the *opposite* direction. But both appeared to be *level* (or at least
as close as you could tell, given the room). 

I can see people walking into a room only to find themselves inside a
reproduction of M.C. Esher\'s "Relativity", or at least a room where
some other people are walking across the ceiling!.

Hmmm. According the the PDF version of SSDS, this simply isn\'t true.
the only statement about gunnery crew sizes (the only statement AT ALL
ANYWHERE mind you - I just went through it again) is:

 "Meson gun and particle accelerator crews are also affected by
  automation. Divide the crew numbers listed in the tables by the
  weapon automation factor: low=1, standard=1.7, or high=2.8"

I think that the way you\'ve interpreted it makes sense, James, but
unfortuately it\'s not how the rules read. :(

The way I picture it working is that there always has to be a turret
gunner. However, if they\'re just left to their own devices, they\'ll
shoot at whatever they feel like, so they aren\'t very efficient. Thus,
on the bridge, we have a centralized console tracking targets and
assigning a single target to a group of turrets - that\'s the purpose
of the master fire director (MFD). Manpower intensize yes, but I don\'t
see any other way to do it - starships in Traveller are not all that
automated when it comes to gunnery... I guess *shrug*.

What I\'d really like is for Guy or whoever designed SSDS to set me straight.
I think I\'ll Cc: him.

Good idea. I\'ll try that. (BTW, killer program that Starship Assembly Line.

THat\'s right - the field only has to produce tenth-of-arcsecond deflections
over light-seconds of travel, so it can be relatively weak. 

I was one of the orignal proponents of this. Once nice side effect is that
although the pulse is too weak to damage anything (other than, as Jospeh says,
a solar sail) you can handwave that it\'s big enough to slightly rattle a 
small ship - laser near-misses would produce a "whoom" noise as the grav pulse
goes by your hull, which is a nice effect in space combat. HIgh TL non-grav
X-ray lasers wouldn\'t produce such a noise, which makes them more frightening
to innocent players in their TL-12 trader...

    'body' => '	Well, here\'s my T4 K\'kree char gen system. It realls is only a first draft 
now, so I\'d love any feedback for how it might be improved. Are some skills 
apperaing to frequently? Are other skills neglected? Anything else?

==================================================================


K\'kree Character Generation

	Because of the extreme gregariousness of the K\'kree, generating K\'kree 
characters requires a very different generation process. In effect, you 
will not be generating a not a single K\'kree, but an entire family - a 
leader, bodyguards, females, and servants - all at once. As well, the 
highly structured caste system of K\'kree society has a profound effect on 
character generation.

	The family patriarch should be generated first. He will be a noble on a 
roll of 5- (on 2D), otherwise he\'ll be well-born. His characteristics 
should be generated first. On a roll of 9-, he has caste - 1D wives 
(otherwise, there are no females in the family). A noble has servants to 
his caste, and bodyguards equal to his caste. A well-born has servants 
equal to half his caste, and bodyguards equal to half his caste.

	Rolling up characteristics is the same as in T4, although with some 
changes. The stats are the same, except that the caste statistic replaces 
social standing. Caste represents the K\'kree\'s position within their caste. 
Thus, a caste 2 noble outranks a caste 12 well-born. There are various 
modifiers to the different characteristics, depending on social standing 
and position. All characteristics have a lower limit of 15, and an upper 
limit of 15, except for strength and endurance which have upper limits of 
25.

	When aquiring skills and experience, K\'kree do not use enlistment, 
promotion or injury rolls. Because of the caste system, individual K\'kree 
have no choice over what career they will take, so no enlistment rolls are 
necessary. Any military ranks are derived from the character\'s caste, so 
the only way to increase rank is to increase caste.

	K\'kree terms of service are 6 years long. During each term, noble and 
well-born characters receive one skill roll in each year of the term (6 per 
term), servant characters receive one skill roll every two years (3 per 
term), and females receive only one skill roll per term.

	For each K\'kree you pre-roll the numbers of term that will be served. All 
male characters serve their first term in the military. Bodyguards and 
military families serve all of their terms in the military. Any other males 
may serve subsequent terms in the military on a roll of 4- (on 2D), but 
they must serve one term out of the military.

	Within each career path there are two separate career skill tables. When 
first entering the service, the character must decide which service the 
character will enter, and which career skill table they will use. They 
can\'t later choose to switch services and skill tables. The choice of 
service will also affect which mustering out table will be used.

	Aging does not occur for K\'kree until the age of 50, but then standard 
aging rules apply. As a result, K\'kree do not age between 35 and 50, but 
then age at the same rate as their human counterparts.

	Mustering out benefits are accrued as per the T4 rules. Only the patriarch 
receives mustering out rolls, but many of the benefits apply to the entire 
family.


New Skills

Diversion (Int or Caste) (females only) - Diversion covers the various 
activities that are esthetic and pleasing to K\'kree society. It is 
essentially a measure of a female K\'kree\'s value in the family.

Enclosure (Int or End) - Enclosure is a measure of how accustomed the 
K\'kree is to the psychological problems associated with being in small or 
cramped spaces, or other circumstances that would isolate them from other 
K\'kree.
	Enclosure-1 is received automatically the first time the character 
receives Ship\'s Boat, Vacc Suit or any vehicle skill (if the character does 
not already have Enclosure-1). For any K\'kree the level of those three 
skills can not be higher than that K\'kree\'s evel of Enclosure

Tolerance (Int or End) - Tolerance is a measure of the K\'kree\'s tolerance 
for non-K\'kree customs and concepts. The level of tolerance is used as a 
modifier to reaction rolls involving aliens.

Polearms - is a subset of the blades group.


Mustering-Out Benefits

Money: the cash value received is multiplied by the number of individuals 
in the family. That moneybelongs to the family collectively.

Weapons: this benefit grants one weapon of the indicated type to each 
warrior/ bodyguard in the family.

Characteristic Alteration: granted only to the patriarch.

Skill: any one member of the family may make one extra skill roll on the 
tables from the last term of service. All males in the family musthave used 
this benefit before any individual can receive it a second time.

Training: all members of the family receive one skill roll.

Starships: denotes outright ownership of a K\'kree Merchant, Transport or 
Courier. Subsequent roles are ignored.

Tools: grants the technician and each servant worker a tool kit. Available 
tools include: mechanical tool kit, electronics tool kit, carpentry tool 
kit, metalwork tool kit, medical kit, hand computer, metal detector, 
radiation counter, chain saw, or similar items.

Formula for Typical surface gravity

g = Gm/r^2; G=Gravitational Constant, m=mass, r=radius
m = Volume*density = (4/3)*pi*r^3 * p ; substituting into above formula:

g=4*G*pi*r*p/3

> What\'s the approximate gravity on Ceres?

Gravitational constant = 6.673e-11 * 4.1e20
Ceres Diameter = 1023 km; r = 511500 m
       Density = 2.3 g/cm^3 = 2300 kg/m^3

g  = 4/3*6.673e-11*3.1415*511500*2300 = 0.33 m/s^2
     or, about 1/30 that of earth.

> How does this vary on a long non-spherical object like a big asteroid?

Equatorial surface gravity = ge = g(1 + el - 1.5w)
    where w = 4*pi^2*r^3/(d^2(1-el)/Gm
         el = ellipticity

Polar surface gravity = gp = ge(1+(2.5-el))

> What\'s the approximate natural gravity on, say, a 1km x 0.5km x 5km rock?

Yuck. I\'m not sure how the above equations hold for such a potato shaped
object; there\'s no consistant diameter. Gravity would be negligible for
such a small asteroid, methinks. I\'m sure walking speed would be greater
than the escape velocity...

Which is another formula you can use:
    Escape velocity = v = sqrt(2*r*g)

For Ceres, that works out to be 580 m/s or so.
For a 1 km dia. spherical rock it\'s about sqrt(0.32) = .57 m/s^2 = 2
km/h!

What about "natural areas" as relax areas for people
working/living far from hospitable planets? (i.e. Asteroids
Miners, Gas Giant refineries and so on?)

The inevitable _Dream Park_ reference was made by Leonard Erickson:
>They deal with a not too distant future amusenent oark doing LARPs.
>Though mostly *without* robots, but with holograms. Besides the active

This is interesting, and a viable alternative to robots, but I
still prefer my idea for at least two reasons:
* Robots can be touched.
* Holograms (and VR) are probably quite affordable in the
 Imperium. The average household in our century (at least in the
 western emisphere) can afford TV, Stereo and PCs. The same could
 probably hold for VRs and Holograms in the far future.  Robots,
 on the other hand, are expensive. Even pooling resources
 (imagine a game group who wants to enlive its experiences) you
 can\'t afford more than 1 or 2 human-size models, probably with
 limited programming.

So the idea of interacting with *hundreds* of realistic robots could
perhaps be such a novelty idea to actually attract people.

Glenn Grant made interesting comments on Gravitics as a way to get better VR:

But I disagree on the rest of his post:
>Leaving aside VR, gravitic tech provides vast opportunities for relatively

>sky-diving with grav-belts ...
*Relatively* *Safe* is not such a winning idea in family oriented
theme parks, IMHO. I suppose (and hope) that even the most
frightening rollercoasters have plenty of *mechanical* failsafe
mechanisms (brakes, etc.). On the other hand, if one of yours 0G
Bumper Cars starts getting power glitches the park owners would have
to deal with deaths among their customers... not a very good
publicity, I\'d say.

   You make a good point, and it illustrates well why I think damping
   fusion will be much harder than damping fission.  You see, the
   nuclear force is many times stronger than the electromagnetic force,
   and the nuclear (strong) force has a finite range with a relatively
   well defined drop off at 1 femptometer, and it saturates.  All this
   means that, barring a little fuzziness, the nuclear force either
   dominates a reaction or doesn\'t enter at all.  Once you raise a
   temperature high enough to overcome the coulomb barrier, your
   reaction will be dominated by nuclear forces, and the coulomb forces
   will cease to contribute any appreciable fraction of the interaction.

   The only way to get around this would be to weaken the nuclear force
   by several orders of magnitude (or strenghten the electromagnetic
   force by several orders of magnitude).  If damper technology could do
   this, then we\'d have very powerful disintegrators.

   What I say here applies to nucleons, deuterons and alphas.  As you
   make heavier nuclei, the saturation of the nuclear force keeps it
   from getting stronger, while the electromagnetic force continues to
   build as more protons are dumped into the mix.  At some point, the
   two forces become comparable in strength, and small changes in the
   nuclear strength can cause radio-isotopes to decay to stabler nuclei,
   thereby damping nuclear /fission/, but not /fusion/.

This is true if you restrict the problem to making the *fuel itself*
explode, a la an atom bomb.  However, making the *plant as a whole*
explode (and distribute fallout over a fairly wide area) is much easier;
at Chernobyl, they managed it accidentally, and at TMI almost did the
same.

The key to realize is that, in the event of a runaway fission reaction,
the fuel rods will try to spontaneously disassemble (love that
euphemism!), usually by melting/fracturing rather than blowing up per se.
If allowed to do so, the threat to surrounding areas is over...but the
interior of the reaction vessel is an utter loss, unrecoverable for
hundreds to thousands of years thanks to the radioactive material flung
around at random inside.

Because power companies (or government power authorities, in the Soviet
case) are highly reluctant to write off an entire reactor, they generally
try to intervene rather than letting the reactor shut itself down
destructively.  The most usual course taken is to dump vast quantities of
cooling water into the system, to prevent the rods from deforming as they
heat, and also because water is a reasonably good neutron absorber, and
hence helps quench the fission reaction.

The problem is that doing this has proven tricky (sometimes) in practice.
At both TMI and Chernobyl, the fuel rods were hotter and more deformed
than had been predicted.  The cooling water flashed to live steam on
contact with the rods, and at Chernobyl the rods themselves shattered from
thermal shock as well.  The resulting steam explosion trashed the interior
of the reactor at TMI, and cracked the containment vessel wide open at
Chernobyl; in the latter case, chunks of the fuel rods landed over a
kilometer away (!), and significant amounts of radioactive material were
dispersed over millions of square kilometers.

So, while creating a nuclear explosion per se in a nuclear power plant is
indeed well-nigh impossible, creating a radioactive, highly dangerous
explosion is (relatively speaking) child\'s play.

Almost any combustible material reduced to airborne dust will burn with
explosive force.  This used to happen fairly often to wheat siloes, for
example, before modern safeguards were developed -- and even now, a silo
explodes from time to time.

Roger Zelazny adn another author that I fail to recall (someone here will
fill it in - they always do) wrote a pretty good yarn called "Flare!"
which postulates that our sun (yes, that second rate little thing!) will
put out a major flare or two in the next hundred years.

Since the setting is 21st century Earth in a system which did not expect
the Sun to produce much in the way of flares, the book is primarily useful
for TL9 -10 societies around usually passive stars, but the principles can
be applied in higher magnitudes to higher level societies; 

Sudden increases in EM radiation on all frequencies

Heating and expansion of the upper atmosphere of planets which have them
(this has serious implications for stations and satellites in low orbits;
suddenly they are experiencing atmospheric braking!)

Flooding of all communication channels (except maybe laser and maser) with
static.

Outer space installations which are not shielded in excess of normal local
conditions (by a factor of 2-3!) may suffer catastophic failure of all
electronics on board, and its inhabitants may be subjected to harmful 
radiation.

Getting a suntan is much easier.

Global Warming could occur if the flares are a trend rather than an
isolated incident.

You get the idea. A good place for an adventure is a geriatric rest home
in low orbit which suddenly finds itself "falling" slowly into a terminal
orbit.  Rescue crews are either busy, or trying to figure out why none of
their electronics are working (this scenario is right out of the
aforementioned book btw).

I am busily finishing off a Postscript-based hex map generator, and I had a
few questions about base codes.  I have looked through various Traveller\'s
digests and various printed maps, and the following seems canonical.  If
there is a better list, or if anyone has something they definitely want to
see or do not want to see, please let me know.

First off, the symbols:  I have small stars, triangles, boxes, diamonds,
circles, individual letters, elongated diamonds, and probably a few other
symbols.  Note that these are used both on subsector-sized maps and on full
sector maps, so it would be nice, though not necessary, if they were
recognizable on both.

Standard ones:

Scout base: triangle
Scout way station:: empty triangle
Naval base: star
Naval depot: star

Others I have heard used, but that are not canon:
Army base: box ?
Marine base: empty box
Vargr base: elongated diamond
Zhodani base: letter Z
non imperial base: dot like gas giants

The codes I have heard go something like:
 A: Naval base and Scout base
 B: Naval base and Scout way station
 G: Garrison
 M: Marine or mercenary base
 N: Naval base
 D: Naval depot
 S: Scout base
 V: Vargr corsair base
 W: Scout way station
 Z: Zhodani base

Usually shown as a white square.

I have never seen these.. since every world will have an Army, and the

Actually, the map I have shows Zhodani bases as a white diamond.

	Hm.  Not sure how well that would work.  The 12-Meter rules was
pretty primitive, and pretty wierd, so that people who designed boats with
grapefruit-sized bumps at the right points, or used winged keels, or other
wierdnesses gained a certain amount of advantage.  The whole purpose of the
varies rules was to standardize things as much as possible, which naturally
led to people finding loopholes and freakish designs evolving.  The thing
is is that I honestly don\'t think that given the current design systems we
can produce different designs to that sort of spec and see a difference; if
we went all-out to maximize performance, eventually we\'d hit on identical
designs.  The design systems don\'t go into the level of detail that
differentiates match-racing sailboats...

	The only reason we get such interesting divergences in the THUDDD
ships is that people have different ideas about what\'s desirable in each
class.  For the last one, I thought that it was the biggest PA gun you can
buy at TL-12 and lotsa lasers, while other benighted souls thought it was
conformity to the contest specs <wierd>.  If we simply went for highest
performance in a 300td hull with room for pilot, navigator, engineer, and
butler, we\'d likely wind up with pretty much the same thing...

The US Air Force uses large phased array radars for slbm detection and
spacetracking of both satellites and debri.  IIRC the 
data they release to the public says that these radar sites can see 
something the size of a basketball at 3000miles.  That seems pretty
impressive. These radar have 1500 separate elements, and each one
is capable of warming up a cup of coffee.  If you walked in front of 
the array and it was focused on you, you\'d be well done in a matter 
of minutes.  All that power is probably why they can see objects
at such a distance.  

	Hey, did anyone else see the article in Popular Science about
electrochromic skins for aircraft?  I remember reading about this 
stuff in the Sten books when it was still science fiction.  So, 
who wants to add a section to FF&S concerning this?

        Worse than that! Did you know that, just like nuclear reactors, the
fuel for coal plants is the same material that\'s used in making extremely
powerful bombs? Why, the whole coalpile could suddenly detonate one day,
destroying entire cities! Ban Coal Now!

(Removing tongue from cheek with tractor beam)

        Of course, it takes some fancy equipment to get the toluene out of
coal and tri-nitrate it to make TNT, but it\'s still easier than separating
out the U235, and nutheads still worry about reactors "blowing up."

        Well, then we need to get the Official Traveller Handwaving
Gymnastics Team on the job to explain how come 

        a) Nobody uses fusion warheads on missiles, despite their being
smaller and more powerful than fission, or
        b) Why nuclear dampers work on fusion warheads, or
        c) Why, despite all the technology advances (and despite how we can
think of several right now), nobody has been able to create a fusion warhead
that doesn\'t require a fission trigger

        Given the fact that nuclear dampers have always been presented as a
defense against missiles.

Ah, yep! 

Of course, you can get explosives out of a stockyard, and what you can do
with fertilizer and fuel oil...well I guess we *all* know about that.

     Mine\'s been used for reference reading but never in play, and so far
it seems to be holding up fine, but for what it\'s worth mine is
non-autographed and may not be from the actual first printing (rec\'d in

There\'s a book by whoever called "Mission of gravity that uses the above
reasoning to make an extreme G planet with gravity varying from about 1G to
perhaps 900 G at the equator.

I haven\'t done the integrations to prove it but my instinct tells me the
above formula for nonespherical objects is blatantly wrong. Remember that
gravity is simply the sum of pulls from all parts of an object where each
objects pull is prop to its mass and inversely prop to the square of range
and alo note that gravitic pull is a vector. The formula when misused like
the above treats the asteroid like all its mass were to be compacted into a
spehere with radius R.

Not true, hexes approximate distance well along any axis. You don\'t even
need an axis. Don\'t take my word for it, try it; get a piece of hex paper
and graph paper. Now draw a bunch of lines on both, even curves or scrawls.
Now count the number of hexes and squares the lines occupy (that is,
crosses through a significant portion of). Now measure the lines. When I
try the hexes are off by about 1 in 10 and the squares by around 1 in 6.
I\'m not a mathematician so I can\'t give you a proof, but if you look at
hexes they are more nearly circular than square. Drawing an arbitrary line
through hexes will cross into another hex at roughly the same distance no
matter what direction the line takes. This is not true with squares; if
your line happens to go diagonal it will go a longer distance before
crossing into the next square. Counting diagonal lines as 1.5 the distance
of orthogonal lines reduces the error to about 1 in 10 also, but then you
have to deal with fractional squares and count differently depending on how
the line curves; you can get a different length by counting in a different
direction. I just find it easier to use hexes.

>The advantage of squares is that EVRUBODY have them. They\'re everywhere so

True, but I photocopy all my hex paper. All the hex paper I have seen has
much too heavy lines anyway; you can barely see the map through those thick
black hexes. Ideally, they should use a faint blue hairline. You can\'t get
hex paper in different scales also; another reason for using a photocopier
with enlargements. I admit the price and quality of graph paper is far
superior to hex paper.

Angry? Moi? Seriously, I don\'t think my reply was angry in the least; I
certainly didn\'t mean it to be so. Do you think the only reason someone
would disagree with you is because they are selling something? My reply may
have been baffled and a little incredulous; I have been playing with hex

And the few designers who\'ve used them that ARE idiots are not neccessarily
idiots for that reason. I actually still have some planetary maps made with
hexes that I haven\'t bothered to change yet;)

Did you know that if you make a standard flattened dodecahedron (standard
planetary map) with hexes where there are as many hexes per triangle side
as the planetary size digit then each hex is almost exactly 1000 km across
at all planetary sizes.

The original poster thought this system would be neat to use for on the fly
generated tactile feedback for shipoperations. Figure the operator in
divingsuit inside those sealed chambers that constanly produce buttons to
push, joysticks to fiddle with etc. A bit impractical don\'t you think;)

These pseudoles are also shot at near lightspeed along the path of so
called grav focussed lasers to keep the lightpulse from quantum
mechanically spreading. The first tested grav focussed lasers were actually
called Meson lasers but the navy changed that as to not confuse it with
Meson guns.

Wow, a huge array of antennas with enormous amounts of power and they see a
basketball at 15% of a spacecombat hex. If you want 1.5 hexes you\'d need
x10 000 more power or x10 000 more antenna area or a combination. Which
almost proves the point that active senors will be useless for spacecombat.
Also note that they\'ve detected Venus by radar from Earth. They used huge
amounts of power and the Arecibo (diameter ca 300 m) antenna to do it
methinks, the same planet is easily detected by the Mark I passive sensor
known as eyball.

Heck, you should have seen the fun last Feb down here in Portland.
There\'s a "seawall" alongside the river downtown. It\'s got these
well-built "posts" about a foot square holding up the sections of
"guardrail" or fence between them. And there are slots where the
concrete slabs used to fit in. They took those out some years back
(they\'d been made removable to make things easier when ships were
docked) and just put in the railings, so as to make the adjacent park
look nicer. But they are needed in case of a bad flood (it makes a four
foot difference in the height of the wall!). And it seems that nobody
knows what happened to them. So we had folks from the city and lots of
civilian volunteers busily cutting plywood to fit, covering it with
plastic sheeting and bracing it in place. And more folks following
along behind to brace these with sand bags and concrete highway
dividers. 

We go lucky. The water came right up to the top of the wall, say about
an inch below the improvised stuff. And when we had a bad flood *this*
spring, we had these nice new *steel* wall sections to drop in and bolt
down.  The flood didn\'t get even close this time, but now the city has
them stored with big notices on them. So they aren\'t likely to wander
again.

On the other hand, a reasonably simple series of computer/equipment failures

Of course, it doesn\'t have to go "boom" to be a problem. Three Mile Island
was a narrowly averted meltdown. Chernobyl (sp?) was a full-fledged one. A
power plant up here in Canada (one of the "super-safe" CANDU plants) was
stopped a few years ago because they found out a contractor was using
sub-spec steel in the superstructure, which would have rendered the
containment vessel basically useless.

Bingo. So the locals have to choose between chemical and possible
radioactive pollution...

And Chernobyl was....what, a figment of the nutheads imagination?

Most coal fired plants do have the requisite elements to generate a nasty
explosion, typically conveyors moving the coal rather roughly from
wherever they store the coal to the plant, not often very far but close
enough to generate the requisite coal dust in enclosed spaces.

Then again, any energy source can be made dangerous. Several years ago my
wife and I (and all our neighbors) were spooked out of our wits...it
sounded (and felt like) something in our garage blew up. A huge boom, all
our windows rattled, and everybody ran out into the street. Turns out that
some poor fool ( with no sense of smell, apparently) had tried to figure
out why his propane heater wouldn\'t light in his trailerr. With a match.
Said trailer was 3 quarters of a mile away from us when it went boom, so I
really can\'t imagine what the noise was like for nearby residents. 

The guy lived, too, with only minor burns, considerable hearing loss, and
some bruises as he was blown through the rapidly expanding debris field
that used to be his trailer.  There ARE things to be said for low armor
values, after all! (and rolling spectacular failures/successes in a row!)

To drag it into traveller terms...think about what would happen if a
canister of flammable gas started leaking in your hold. Nope, simply
pressing that switch to open the airlock probably isn\'t the first thing
you would want to do...

Mission of Gravity, by Hal Clement. Whether or not the equation is misused
to produce that planet, the planet couldn\'t exist. anything big enough to
have 900 G\'s anywhere on it\'s surface would pull itself into a sphere
rather rapidly.

I haven\'t read the book in ages and ages, though, so I don\'t remember the
handwaving details.

Damn...all this loose talk about handwaving is stirring some inexplicable
appetite for a corn-dog ;-)

That is reasonable for color output.  I had not considered making the
postscript output color compatible, as I do not have access to a color
printer.  That seems like a reasonable idea, and I will look into seeing
how hard it will be. It would also be nice to color water worlds blue.

I have never seen these.. since every world will have an Army, and the
Marines tend to co-locate with the Navy, they might be redundant.

I expected that marine bases were always colocated with Navy bases, else
how would the marines get there, but I have had a trickle of people asking
for them.  When someone used them on me, I assumed they were actually
mercenary bases.

Ah!  I like that better.  Do you have any maps with Vargr bases?  If so, I

Yes, I meant to say the _UWP_ codes, but mistyped.

Certainly so in my world.

In the Regency Sourcebook, Depots are shown as a solid black square on the

INS Bulletin ... 078-0002 ...

Sylea-Sylea : Imperial Spokesperson Kalagushiigii denied the "baseless and malicious" 
allegations of ValuJump chairman Darius Sadri that it was Imperial regulation that had 
resulted in the stabalization of cargo freighting prices to Cr 1000/ton. The fall from 
pre-Imperial levels was due to the massive lessening of the "risk premium" of starship 
travel, due to the increased safety and security brought by the unified Imperium and the 
hard work of the anti-piracy patrols of the Imperial Navy. Whilst there had been some 
Imperial regulation of trade and starship travel, such as mandatory transponder 
installation and use, the Imperium was willing to let the market be free, unless of 
course market failure threatened the economic stability of any of the Imperium\'s member 
worlds, in which case His Magesty reserved the right to use His IN transports to move 
commercial cargo within the Imperium.

How valuable would uranium be in the Imperium ? Given nukes are maximally illegal, and 
that fission power would only be used by a small percentage of worlds, and if you need 
hard currency to buy the uranium, you might as well just buy a TL9 fusion plant.

At a guess, you\'d need Chemistry to analyze these to any point beyond "It\'s a chrondite 
rock", right ? My guess is that this is where the gem compounds  would be, which would 
be a major Belter target.

My guess is that you would actually put your base on a decent-size ice asteroid.

Yup. Although the metal asteroids are probably valuable enough to be worthwhile grabbing

The standard hex-based planetary map is an unfolded *icosahedron* -- a
20-sided regular polyhedron (familiar to any funny-dice gamer as a
20-sided die).  A dodecahedron is a 12-sided regular polyhedron, also
familiar to fans of funny dice.

One cool thing to notice is that if you put a dot in the center of each
face of an icosahedron, and connect adjoining dots with edges, the
resulting figure is a dodecahedron.  The reverse is also true.  Another
such pair is the octrahedron and the cube.  And, coolest of all, a
tetrahedron forms such a "pair" with itself!

Well, *I* think it\'s cool, anyway. :)

I take your point - however, whatever system you use has to be simple (I\'d
define RPSCS as simple in this context). The basic RPG ship combat does not
need the detail that was in TNE...

I mean something with a system like the old starter Traveller range bands,

I tend to run a more narrative style in the ship combat, and as a result
don\'t really want to loose the control over the player\'s fates that
switching to a board game style triggers. This hardens the blurred edges I
like on the rules system.

That would be nice - also IIRC Andy Lilly and co at CORE had a prototype
CCG for ship combat.. could make TCS interesting! ;-)

	Chernobyl was not a nuclear explosion, which is what the nutheads are
always worrying about. It was a purely chemical explosion, caused by the
heat generated by the core meltdown. And it was caused by poor design,
negligent operators, and f*cked up maintenance.

	Incidentally, I remember some anti-nuke commentator in Britain complaining
after TMI that nobody got killed! After all, then people would realize just
how dangerous those things are. Completely ignored the fact that, in my
opinion, TMI showed how safely they\'re designed. Despite a comedy of errors
as large as Chernobyl, the failure was contained. If you were on-site when
it happened, you\'d have gotten about as much radiation exposure as a
resident of Denver gets in a year.

This should let you lose another 5 tons of cargo or so to add

Yup.  This was first published in JTAS years ago.  Too bad GDW kept on using
their original "7-hex" maps with the varying hex scales. :-(

I\'ve always preferred to keep a constant hex scale, so all my maps are drawn
using this system.  What\'s more, it means that players can get a better feel
for how much surface area a world has.  I\'m glad to see I\'m not the only
person still doing this.

And for what it\'s worth, Metator uses this system as well.  <shamelss plug>

Seriously, I\'ve always assumed that passive sensors detect mainly radiated

gut feeling.  Is this an incorrect assumption?

Oh God, don\'t remind me.

We had a gas leak at school last semester.  Most of my colleagues blithely
went back to their offices, turned on the lights so they could find their
handbags, and then turned off the lights (to save energy?) on the way out. 
One even finished her photocopying first!!!

I suspect the Traveller universe will be equally full of people who don\'t
understand technology, and believe that what they don\'t know can\'t hurt them.

Actually, a Polearms skill is probably not a bad idea.  After all, if you\'re

differentiate between a club and a pike!

I prefer the following split:

Unarmed Melee Combat
Melee Combat (bashing)
Melee Combat (stabbing)
Melee Combat (slashing)

This differentiates combat skils by the style of attack, and doesn\'t give
undue preference to swords.

Mind you, if duels are a common element in the "honourable" society of the
Third Imperium, then having special skills just for swords makes sense.  In
this case, I would expect different societies to have their own unique combat
skills.

At this point, I haven\'t given the species an astrographical location -- an

********************************************************************************

                                The Sayat
                        A Minor Race of Humaniti
                           Part I:  Biology

The Sayat are a subspecies of humaniti found on Marhach (Milieu 0 UPP
A665887-A ?), a cold but essentially Earthlike planet located well beyond
the Imperial frontier.

APPEARANCE:
The Sayat are somewhat smaller than the typical Solomani or Vilani --
averaging 1.6 m tall, and massing approximately 55 kg.  They have slender
frames and long limbs; while their fingers are exceptionally long, the
palms and feet are disproportionately small.

Skulls are brachycephalic, with generally round or oval upper faces, high
cheekbones, and a slightly triangular, pointed jaw and chin structure.
Their convex, high-bridged noses are fairly small but well-adapted to
warming air.  Eyes are markedly large, exhibit reflective retinas (like
Terran cats or dogs), have large dark irises and minimal albumen, and are
protected from cold and snow by thick, heavy lashes.

Dentition is slightly different than that found in the Solomani and Vilani
strains of humaniti:   the Sayat lack "wisdom teeth," and their first
semimolars (both uper and lower) are canine in form.  In general, the teeth
are smaller and harder than those of other humans.

Hair is coarse, thick, straight, and jet black in color, slightly
bluish-tinged.  With age, it greys and eventually turns a snowy white.
Despite the cool climate of the world, they have minimal facial and body
hair.

The Sayat have a generous layer of subcutaneous fat, which provides
insulation on their cold homeworld -- and in emergencies, can readily be
converted into energy.  This layer gives them a sleek, rounded appearance,
despite their thin frames.

Their homeworld orbits a cooler star than Sol, but due to its thin
atmosphere (almost lacking an ultraviolet ray-blocking layer) and weak
electromagnetic field, the planet is a relatively high-radiation
environment.  Accordingly, Sayat \'pseudomelanin\' (biochemically distinct
from the melanin found in both Solomani and Vilani subspecies) is an
efficient absorber of UV radiation and producer of necessary vitamin D.
This pseudomelanin imparts a coppery skin complexion with a distinct
reddish tint.  When exposed to sunlight for any length of time, the Sayat
tan to a vivid dark russet color.  Nicknames for the Sayat among their
interstellar neighbors often refer to this feature.

Another physiological change from the original human template is the
so-called "muting" of the vocal apparatus.  Essentially, Sayat vocal cords
do not vibrate except under extreme stress (i.e., shouting, screaming),
preventing the production of normal speech sounds.  Rather, the Sayat
"whisper."  This feature has had significant effect on their language and
communication habits; however, they are not strictly speaking mute.

PHYSIOLOGY:
Due to the lower gravity of their homeworld, Sayat are typically a little
less muscular than the human norm; however, they have slightly faster
reaction times.  They do have measurably greater endurance and stamina than
the Solomani or Vilani, but their strange circadian rhythms may cause
exhaustion at inopportune times, even after adaptation to a local standard.
Tolerance for low temperatures is usually much greater than usual for
Solomani or Vilani.  They may find dense atmospheres, particularly those
with a high oxygen content, difficult to breathe.

There is an extremely high occurance of left-handedness or ambidexterity in
the population -- in fact, only about 30-40% of the population is strongly
right-handed.  A similar feature is found among the Darrian of the Spinward
Marches, in whose case it is hypothesized that a much larger than average
bridge between the two lobes of the brain contributes to their increased
inventiveness, imagination, and mathematical, musical, and artistic
ability.  The same might be supposed of the Sayat, though these qualities
are not the overt cultural fixation that they are for the Darrian.  In any
case, tools and implements are customarily designed to be used with either
hand.

SENSES are roughly equivalent to those of other subspecies of humaniti,
though vision is adapted to lower levels of light (c. 52% of Terra\'s).
Accordingly, glare-cutting prostheses are standard wear in local daytime
(especially in snowy or icy terrain) and even in Terran-normal lighting
conditions; night-vision is superior to Solomani and Vilani.  A form of
color-blindness (or color-vagueness) is quite common in varying degrees.
Sense of smell and taste is slightly less acute than the human norm as
well; hearing tends to be sharper.

BIOCHEMICAL and cellular-level changes due to geneering are quite extensive.

The Sayat have several unusual or unique enzymes which aid in protein
synthesis; they are able to metabolize one extra amino acid, apparently
native to their homeworld.  Related to this biochemistry is a
characteristic body odor, which is cannot be perceived by many humans.
Other species may be able to quite well, however; the Vargr tend to find
the smell pleasant (perhaps contributing to their tendency to regard many
Sayat as having high \'charisma\'); the K\'kree, on the other hand, find the
Sayat odor highly offensive and nauseating ("like wet blood").

Sayat blood types (A, N, O, S, Z) are often compatible or semi-compatible
with a few Solomani, one Vilani, and several Zhodani types.

Their lungs are human-sized, but have a more efficient oxygen-extracting
mechanism, permitting normal activity in their slightly thinner and
oxygen-poor atmosphere.

There is somewhat greater reiteration of genes than in most human species,
providing good "backup" against genetic damage by virus or radiation.
This is an unusual feature in modern geneered species, and serves as the
basis for speculation that the Sayat are one of Grandfather\'s experiments,
and were not created by the Hiver and/or Solomani in more recent times.

REPRODUCTION:
The most obvious change, and in some respects the most drastic change, from
the human norm is in the realm of reproduction.  The Sayat are a
monosexual, homozygotic species.  Two ova from different individuals are
able to merge and form a fertilized embryo; mechanical means must be used
to introduce one ovum into the uterus of the birth parent.  Normally ova of
a single individual are incapable of fertilizing one another, but
exceptions are not unheard of, and as a result, spontaneous pregnancies are
account for perhaps 1 in 100,000 births.  Such parthenogenetic children are
genetically identical copies of their birth parent.   Live offspring are
born after a gestation period of about 258.5  standard days.  Multiple
births are extremely rare -- maybe one in ten million.  They are not
inter-fertile with other human species (either males or females).

Fertility -- or at least successful impregnation -- is relatively low, and
the natural rate of population growth is slow.   While this hampers
expansion on the interstellar scale, it has slowed the pace of development
so that the integration and efficiency of the homeworld and of colonies is
very high.  Perhaps due to the long lack of other human species to which to
compare themselves, they see nothing wrong with their rate of population
growth, and have never particularly sought to increase fertility by medical
or social means.

LIFESPAN:
A biochemical mechanism similar to that present in the Vlazhdumecta give a
lifespan considerably longer than the human norm.  In premodern times,
natural lifespans of 80 years were normal; at the current state of medical
science, this has been pushed up to 100 years as the average.  They have
not (yet) produced anything directly equivalent to the anagathic treatments
known to some other human subspecies, however.  Senescence usually does not
start until about the age of 60 (coinciding with menopause), and is very
limited until the last 2-3 years of life -- during which time the physical
and mental breakdown is quite rapid.  As among the Vlazhdumecta, this is
usually the signal for suicide.

Puberty and mental maturity usually begins around the age of 15, and full
physical maturity is reached in about 5 years.  In this regard, they are
somewhat slower to mature than many other subspecies of humaniti of a
comparable level of socio-technological development

DIET:
The Sayat are omnivorous, tending towards carnivorism -- and traditionally,
blood-drinking.  One of their enzymatic adaptations allows digestion of a
native Marhachian amino acid (otherwise unusable), after it has been
semi-metabolized into the blood of other geneered Terran organisms present
on the planet.  Thus, the ancient Sayat herding economy is based on the
production of blood as much as of milk and meat.  Animal blood is still a
traditional, ceremonial drink in Sayat culture, serving something of the
same function that champagne has in Solomani culture.

Generally speaking, Sayat are able to extract nutrition from a fairly wide
variety of biochemistries; greater than is typical for humaniti, in any
case.  A flexible metabolism permits easy and safe fluctuation between
fasting and feasting; the lipids used for energy storage in the Sayat body
are efficient and rapidly convertible back into energy.  Even without
advance preparation, a Sayat in good health can often go without food for
up to a standard week and suffer negligible ill effects.  Their metabolism
is also able to step up into a faster-burning, high-energy level, which
permits comfortable activity in cold climates with limited technological
assistance, so long as a steady supply of food is available.  Sayat who are
in this "prolonged overdrive" are constantly nibbling on something.

In general, Sayat gain and loose weight rapidly, and it shows up clearly in
their appearance.  Much small talk and polite conversation in Sayat society
revolves around commenting on one another\'s plumpness or bonyness.

REST:
Their home planet has an extremely slow period of axial revolution -- just
over 103 standard hours.  The Sayat have adapted to this environment by
largely doing away with anything recognizable as a circadian rhythm.
Season and lattitude (lighting levels) and temperature affect these
patterns, but it is hard to predict any individual\'s activity.  In any
given period of 103 hours, a Sayat will sleep for 39, engage in
low-activity rest and relaxation for 20, work for 32, and have one or more
shorter bursts of intense work activity totalling 12 hours -- on the
average.  Note that the metabolic flexibility and greater stamina permits
extremely prolonged periods of exercise -- 24 hour work shifts are not
considered particularly onerous by most Sayat (though they\'re not popular,
either).

PSIONICS:
The Sayat seem to have approximately the same frequency and levels of
psionic talents as other branches of humaniti.  As with the Zhodani,
though, early childhood screening and training causes more talented
individuals to be found, creating the impression of there being \'more
psionics\' in the Sayat subspecies.

The vessel to be produced is an exploratory trader.  The design is being
commissioned by the Imperial government (through the Ministry of
Commerce); their intent is that vessels of this class will be purchased
and operated by megacorporations and possibly smaller speculative
enterprises.  Subsidies are under consideration. 

The following requirements must be met:

* Size:         3000 dt or less
* Jump:         J2 or more
* Acceleration: 1G or more

The vessel must be capable of:

* Wilderness refueling (directly or via carried craft)
* Operation for 1+ year away from starport facilities
  (repair, resupply, recreation, etc.)
* Landing/retrieving crew and cargo on planetary surfaces
  (directly or via carried craft)
* Defense against similarly sized TL 11- spacecraft

Defense against relic TL 12+ weaponry should also be considered.

Provision must be made for security of landing parties and the care of
wounded crew members. 

The purpose of this vessel is exploratory trade, well beyond the Imperial
frontier.  As such, normal economic analysis based on intra-Imperial trade
profitability does not apply well to this vessel.  However, as with any
trader, a higher percentage of hull volume devoted to cargo implies higher
profits -- *if* the requirements above are also met.  The same comments
apply to the vessel\'s price.

I\'m sorry but these individuals will have to try a LOT harder to make
this year\'s Darwin Award nominee list.  My favourite is the country
yokel that decided to use an unfired .22 LR cartridge as a fuse in his
pappy\'s pick-up truck.  Yeow!

   I like option (c) above.  Quite frankly, I haven\'t been convinced
   that any of the several alternatives to fission discussed on this
   list are at all feasible.  Most that I\'ve seen proposed come with the
   explanation that Trav tech can certainly provide enough /energy/ for
   a fusion /reaction/,  but that\'s a far cry from being able to
   provide enough /power/ for a fusion /explosion/.  There\'s a crucial
   difference between energy and power, between a reaction and an
   explosion.  That difference has to do with timescale.  A pound of
   coal releases more energy than a pound of TNT, but we all know that
   a burning pound of coal is not as dangerous as a burning pound of
   TNT, because TNT burns many orders of magnitude faster, releasing
   many orders of magnitude more /power/.  It is this power output that
   makes explosives dangerous.

   While a Traveller power plant may be able to release more /energy/
   than an equally sized fission trigger, there\'s no way it can
   release more /power/.  The power output of a fission bomb is
   staggering, and it is this power that is needed to initiate a fusion
   explosion.  Any less power, and you will initiate a mere fusion
   reaction which will emit its energy over a long period (like coal)
   instead of a short one (like TNT).

I think you mean *icosahedron* (20 sides). Dodecahedron is only 12

One interesting possibility is that due to the length of jump, a ship
could jump out before any sysmptoms show, and have everyone *dead* or
in low berths by the time it exits jump. 

The boys in Beltwatch *don\'t* want to have to deal with a ship coming
out of jump with a distress signal going and the code indicating
"plague".

If we accept the idea that the 100 diameter limit is just an
approximation that works for planets with normal density, then you are
safe. Because that makes the limit be *based* on tidal force strength!
So you\'d pop out at the distance where tidal forces are the same as at
100 diameters from an object of more reasonable density.

It\'s *really* ugly figuring such things. Luckily Ceres is big enough
that it will be roughly spherical. So you just need the mass and
radius. A=GM/r^2

For irregular shapes, you have to sum the pull of all the atoms. This
requires either heavy number crunching or messy calculus or both. 

If you feel up to it, establish a 3d array, and stick in figures for
mass at each location. Then take another 3d array, and for each point
figure the strength *and direction* of the attraction from each point
in the other array. Sum the vectors. The result is a crude map of the
gravity field.

No, Clement\'s "Misson of Gravity" gets the gravity variance "honestly".
The planet has a day that is 17.8 minutes long! The gravity is 3 g at
the equator and somewhere between 700 and 900 at the poles (he never
*does* give an exact figure).

The drop in gravity is due to *spin*, and is partly compensated for by
the extreme flattening of the planet. :-)

you are figuring the distances *backwards*. The way you find the
distance between two hexes or squares is to count along an axis that
goes in the right direction until you are as close as that direction
will take you. Then move on the axis that now rruns straight towards
the destination.

With hexes, the distance gotten this way is reasonably close to the
real distance. With squares, you have to do the d=sqrt(x^2+y^2) bit.

*That* is why wargames use hex grids. You get a reasonablke accurate
resukt from only an addition instead of squares and square roots. 

Also, try figuring *movement* on a square grid. You can move distance
X, and you want to go in some arbitrary direction. How do you figure
out which square to stop on *without* a ruler?

Well, I\'m reminded of the time we sat down with one of the Arduin
Grimoire books and tried to figure out which of the diseases were
actually possible. Turned out that a bunch of the nastier ones *were*.

A strain of E. coli developed for recycling cellulose waste into
methane for fuel actually exists and was shelved because it can live in
the human digestive tract. The results would be much like what ranchers
call "bloat". Uncontrollable production of intestinal gas, faster than
it can be "passed". If surgical intervention isn\'t taken, the guts
swell until they rupture.

How about an organism that eats collagen. That makes your skin a prime
source of food. And collagen is what binds cells together into organs
and muscles, even bones. If your immune system can\'t kill it, you\'ll
just start sloughing off layers of cells until you die as a puddle of
cells. The "Flesh-eating" bacteria in the real world works something
like this.

I don\'t recall the others, but you get the idea.

Unless artificial gravity is some force that affects individual
particles but is otherwise totally unlike gravity (not likely) then
it\'s very unlikely to be easily distinguished from "real" gravity.
Heck, you can\'t tell the difference between *acceleration* and gravity!

That\'s the "technical" side of things. On the "practical" side of
things, the way field strength varies is going to be more than a little
different. Unfortunately, since gravity is the *weakest* force we know
of detecting this is damned hard.

In case anyone is surprised by the idea of gravity as a *weak* just
consider that a cheap toy magnet can exert more force on a piece of
iron than all the mass of the earth. The static charge from rubbing a
pirce of fur on a glass rod will attract small objects more strongly
than the earth. 

It\'d take lab grade equipment to detect the fact that the gravity in a
room changes from floor to ceiling. And I bet that artificial gravity
units could be adjusted to have such a change (it\'d be a pain, as it\'d
reuire having the field expand as it goes up, which has some problems
with keeping it confined.

It\'s equivalent to trying to detect the difference between a
geometrically flat floor and one that matches the curve of the planet.

Well, there\'s the problem of how you keep the H-s in the middle.

And going into physics, the amount of heat absorbed by the H-s is
proportional to its surface area. You *don\'t* want a point. You want
the biggest sphere you can get. Better yet, an oblate spheroid as that
has a lot more area for the volume. 

You are still limited by the rate at which your radiators emit energy,
even if the H-s is one way.

Black holes don\'t "need" to suck in matter. They can easily occur in
isolation. They\'ll be easily detectable unless *very* old, as they are
supernova remanents. So that means that until the nebula has had
millions of years to dissipate, it\'ll be obvious to anyone who knows
what to look for that there ought to be a neutron star or black hole in
the area.

Yes. The explanation you quoted isn\'t the one Hawking gives. The way it
works is that Planck\'s constant can also be used to state that you
can\'t determine the *energy* of a system without taking some time to do
so. The shorter the time the less certain the energy. 

So, all over the universe, you have energy appearing from nothing and
returning before the time limit expires. Energy above a certain amount
spontaneously breaks down to a particle of matter and its matching
antiparticle. And when the time limit hits, they disappear.

So, near a black hole, when this hapens, one of the particles (it
doesn\'t mater *which* as they have the same mass) can get sucked in
while the other one heads away from the hole. Since you can\'t get
anything back from inside the hole (it\'s effectively one *big*
particle), when the time limit expires, the *hole* has to lose the
energy, and the particle that was heading out continues to do so. The
"rules" are satified, as the universe doesn\'t care *where* the energy
disappears from justy so it disappears before the time limit!

Say the hole has a mass of X and each particle has a mass of N. 

Start:	hole of mass X
    1:  hole of mass X		energy of 2N
    2:	hole of mass X		particle of mass N	particle of mass N
    3:	hole of mass X+N				particle of mass N
    4:  hole of mass X+N	energy of -2N		particle of mass N
	(X+N)- 2N = X-N
    3:	hole of mass X-N				particle of mass N

Since you can\'t get 2N of energy out of a particle massing N, it all
has to come out of the black hole. So it *appears* that the hole has
emitted a particle, but it actually hasn\'t.

TMI was much *worse* than any accident scenario that had been proposed
by the anti-nuke people. If their claims were remotely close to the
truth, much of the area would be an uninhabitable radioactive
wasteland. Instead they barely exceeded their legal emission levels.
Matter of fact, last I heard, it was thought that TMI actually *did*
melt down, at least partially. 

> Chernobyl (sp?) was a full-fledged one.

Chernobyl had *no* containment. And it wasn\'t a meltdown. It exploded
after the graphite in the core caught fire. For all practical purposes
Chernobyl is worse than what terrorists could do to a properly designed
plant. The crew couldn\'t have done worse if they\'d been *trying* to
make it blow up. But it took that criminally bad design to let them do it.

You can\'t do much about criminal stupidity. Personally, I rather like
the Roman ceremony for opening a bridge or aqueduct. They put the chief
engineer in a boat anchored under the central span. Then they turned on
the water or started heavy traffic across. If it collapsed, guess who
died first?

No, they get both. Coal plants emit levels of radioactive material
(mostly fly ash) that would get a nuclear plant shut down.

Combine with the recent post about the positron stream from the core

won\'t bother planets much, at least not ones with enough of an
atmosphere and mag field to make a decent set of Van Allen type belts.

More likely scenario...

An area with hotsprings and the like finally cuts through into a rich
uranium deposit. The water acts as a moderator, allowing the formation
of a natural reactor, much like the ones we\'ve found the remains of in
the Congo. As the water flow thru the formation varies, the reactor
cycles from on to off. Say the reactor only runs during the rainy
season, the resort was surveyed and built during the "dry" season
(figure a hot star so the planet has a *long* year). So the first time
guests are there over the wet season, people start getting sick for no
reaon. And maybe this has been going on long enough that there are
micro-organisms, plants, even animals adapted to the higher rad levels.
So the ecosystem changes as the rad level rises.

> Fun universe we live in, isn\'t it?

One from one of Julia Ecklar\'s stories (Tide of Stars, Analog, Jan 95).
Planet with no moon, only slight solar tides, and a climate such that
the temp never drops to 4C. So the oceans never "turn over". So the
deeps get depleted in oxygen and have an anaerobic ecology. At some
point this builds up until it reaches the surface and the whole planet
gets gassed by the Hydrogen Sulphide released... This really happens in
some tropical lakes on Earth. It can happen in oceans on a warm enough
planet under the right conditions.

Well, Chernobyl had no containment worthy of the name (still doesn\'t).
TMI didn\'t come all that close. What they *did* almost have to do was
vent the containment. Which would have grossly exceeded the allowable
emissions for the plant but not been all that dangerous downwind.

At our TL that is true. With either nuclear dampers, or fusion torches
and the "isotope sorters" I\'ve described in the past, it\'s not that big
a deal. With the dampers, you just accelerate things until all the
stuff has decayed.

With the fusion refining setup, you just chop the contaminated stuff
up, feed it through and rebuild with the purified elements. You keep
the radio-isotopes, as they have industrial uses.

There *wasn\'t* a containment at Chernobyl. Just a normal building,
reinforced pretty normally. So the blast ripped the entire roof off
over the reactor.

And coal mines tended to go boom too.

In 1970, the radio telescope at Goldstone mapped the near side

They had to do all sorts of tricks to get that resolution.  
Goldstone is a 64 meter antena, operating at 12.5 cm wavelength.
This gives a 7 arc-minute beam width.  Venus is only 1 arc-minute
across at closest approach.  Instead, they made use of the
fact that Venus is a sphere (almost).  The first returns to come
back were from the center, the later returns from the limb.
They also used the Doppler shift from its rotation.  Returns
from the east side were blue shifted, while the west side was
red shifted (remember Venus is retrograde).  These two features
allowed them to build up maps better than those made by the
radar on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter (~20km resolution).  The
PVO, on the other hand, could see both sides of the planet.

Johannes Kepler Lives!

That was his technique for attempting to figure out the orbital radii of the
planets. Eventually he had to give the whole idea and use a bunch of
ellipses, but he apparently didn\'t do too bad with the polygons...

Another philosophical note:

Tetrahedron (4 sides) = Fire
Cube (6 sides) = Earth
Octahedron (8 sides) = Air
Dodecahedron (12 sides) = ?
Icosahedron (20 sides) = Water

Plato spent a lot of time trying to figure out what the Dodecahedron stood
for...

Rather than that, do the math. For a square, it\'s simple. The length of the
diagonal of a square is sqrt(2) times the distance across. That means, for
something at a 45=F8 angle (the maximum deflection), things will be about=
 1.4
times as far away. That\'s why games with diagonal movement often multiply
the diagonal range by 1.5 - to get a good approximation.

In a hexagon, the same ratio is sqrt(3)/2, with the added complication that
when you draw a line from the center of a hex to one corner (a "diagonal" of
sorts) you move along the edge of the adjacent hex. The corner to corner
distance across the center of a hex is twice the length of a side, and
sqrt(3)/2 times the distance from edge to edge (fairly elementary trig -
just divide the hex into 6 equilateral triangles). In any case, if a
distance of 10 hexes across hex faces (normal movement for most games) is
defined as 10 spaces, then the corresponding distance on the diagonal (30=F8
to right or left) is ~8.66 spaces; a lot less deviation.

I have hex paper in a number of different scales - 1" and 5/8" are both
pretty common; other scales can be found for mapping. Actually, I designed a
relatively okay hexagon in powerpoint...

The contacts in switches often spark when the switch is turned on or off.  If
you have a situation where the switch is surrounded by an explosive mixture
(such as propane/air) then you can have a nasty BOOM on your hands.

Mind you, I expect that switches for spaceships will be specified with this
in mind, just as contemporary hazmat installations use sealed switches. 
Unless, of course, someone has been scrimping by using Bob\'s Discount Annual
Maintenance Package, or the engineer made a mistake, or the supplier cheated,
or...  (Sealed switches are a _lot_ more expensive than ordinary ones.)

In this situation, I would make a secret roll against the quality of the
shipyard performing the last annual maintenance to see if they made a mistake
(either deliberately through cost-cutting or accidentally through
negligence), and another for the ship\'s engineer to see if he accidentally
missed the mistake when inspecting the work.  (I assume that the engineer,
who is travelling on the ship, is properly paranoid about things like this. 
A sloppy engineer character who tries to do too much has major negative DMs
on this task!

Being an engineer, I can come up with convincing, technically accurate
descriptions of hazardous situations on-the-fly.  If my players don\'t accept
them, they are good enough gamers to come up with their own alternate
descriptions (rather than just claiming that everything must be safe).

If the player makes a mistake that their character shouldn\'t (eg. an artist
playing an engineer) I have them roll against the character\'s
intelligence/education/skill and, if they succeed, warn them of the
(potential) mistake. A failure here means that the character was
distracted/careless/whatever.  (Which happens in emergencies: I\'ve got some
funny-after-the-fact stories from my Emergency Response Team days.)

	Depends. I measure the *direction* of the force at two different places.
If the direction is parallel, it\'s inertial and hence acceleration. If the

self-natural-selection. In the case of the gentleman above, he and a

would fit right into the fuse holder, and brass conducts electricity, so he

eventually discharged into his ... personal area.

	Except that I believe there are already technologies which come *close* to
providing fusion trigger capability without fission. And the need in a
warhead *isn\'t* power. It\'s providing the compression and/or heat
necessary. Again, some of the options:

	- Laser triggering. Already in development stages to detonate a *small*
pellet of hydrogen or isotopes to initiate a fusion reaction for power
plants or for the Daedalus drive proposed by the British Interplanetary
society.

	- Collapsing grav field. If you can make superdense armor, you should be
able to create a pulse of intensely high-G within the warhead to simulate
stellar cores.

	- Highly Improved chemical explosives.

	- Nuclear damper technology. If you can increase the strong force (as
somebody corrected me), you may be able to overcome more of the electrical
repulsion between protons. Especially if you combine this with one of the
other triggering mechanisms.

	And I\'m not all that imaginative... I\'m sure somebody more knowledgeable
and creative can come up with with other ideas.

I thought that the Imperial army formations had only cadres as permanent features, and 
called up the reserves to fill out the units in time of war.  Thus an Imperial 
army division would have a divisional headquarters unit, fully staffed; a regimental or 
battalion headquarters unit, fully staffed, for each regiment or battalion; company 
officers; a lot of senior NCOs; and a unit dedicated to training the reserves.  The 
reserves would of course meet for regular exercises.

I think your second paragraph largely answers your first.  The Imperium is a social and 
political contract among the Imperial family, the nobility, and the member states.  The 
terms are that the member states can do almost whatever they want internally, except try 
to overturn the contract.  The nobility -- which has existed since long before the 
Imperium -- keeps its traditional powers and properties, advises the Emperor on policy 
matters, and, most important, is the only party with the right to terminate the 
contract.  The Imperial family administers the Imperium to the benefit of the nobility 
and the member states, and receives undreamt wealth and power.  

The tone of your last paragraph suggests that you believe that member states are more 
limited in their self-rule than I believe them to be -- at least by the Classic 
Traveller era.  The Imperium doesn\'t set forth extensive and detailed rules and 
regulations that apply directly to the rule of member states.  It doesn\'t need to.  

The situation appears different in Milieu: Zero (which I don\'t have).  In its early 
stages, the Imperium appears to have been really imperial, dictating local policy much 
more than later.  At some point it reached a critical mass, at which point it could not 
effectively govern the member states, and it no longer needed to do so, because it had 
become largely self-sustaining.  That appears to have been when it covered most of the 
space of the old Ziru Sirka.

Not Traveller (Role Master), but a good one anyways: The group had been
creeping around in a labyrinth for a couple of days taking extraordinary
care not being discovered since somewhere in the labyrinth there was a
powerful sorcerer. Suddenly they came upon a large door, and one of the
players strolled up to it saying "Perhaps it\'s a hemrit!" (delibirate
spelling error since he used the wrong word) and knocked on the door.
Naturally the big bad guy was just beyond that door. They survived, but
not by much.

I think it\'s pretty cool too. The Platonic solids are funny that way. For 
more really interesting geometric discussion of things like that, I 
recommend _A Fuller explanation : the synergetic geometry of R. 
Buckminster Fuller_ by Amy C. Edmondson.

Besides properties of regular solids, how they can be divided into little 
bits that can be put together to form a different regular solid, the 
superiority of tensile strength over compressive is descussed, the basis 
of Bucky\'s invention of the geodesic dome.

It really opens your eyes... the state of civil engineering is in the 
dark ages. I think future societies will see our "boxy" houses as quite 
quaint and wasteful.

Athletics 1 : Local customs expect that any prospective coach or trainer

signifficant crossovers, especially as a First Aid defult. 
Tall Poppies Syndrome: Parts of the culture is obsessed with egalaterian 
ideals, and have gone to lengths to drag some disadvantaged people up to 
the norm. This process has the disadvantage of dragging most guifted 
people down to the norm, it styfles achivement or excelence.
Conversly anyone who breaks this social barrier and achives notariety and 
excelence is also trapped into continuing to be expected to preform at

	Famille Spofulam Yards is pleased to announce its entry for this
month\'s THUDDD competition.  FSY\'s philosophy for this ship class is that
medium is better; several medium-size ships can cover more territory,
visiting more systems, than a single large vessel.  Thus, a megacorporation
equipped with a  fleet of Recollets, rather than a few large vessels, will
be able to better explore the new markets on the fringes of the Imperium or
beyond.  As well, smaller entrepreneurs will be able to afford an extremely
capable frontier trader.  However, too small a vessel will have severe
shortcomings in cargo capacity and defensive punch, not to mention
small-craft and repair facilities.  Thus, we here at FSY feel that a
medium-sized vessel, capable of extended duration, with self-repair and
small-craft facilities, good defenses, and fair cargo capacity, is the best
approach to commercial exploration beyond the Imperial pale.  Hence, the
Recollet-class Exploratory Trader.


	The Recollet is built into a rock solid 500-ton streamlined
wedge-configuration hull, stressed to 10 G\'s for atmospheric operations,
and heavily armoured.  The Recollet is equipped with fuel scoops capable of
ingesting its full fuel load in slightly over 45 minutes, and refining it
in just over three hours.  It is also equipped with a 40-ton hangar capable
of accomodating a standard 20-ton launch (not included in MSRP) or serving
as supplementary cargo or storage space.  Other facilities designed to
extend the Recollet\'s duration in the field include an electronics shop and
a machine shop, and 2 years fuel storage for its 375 Mw Zhunastu Fusion
Systems power plant.  Its hold is capable of accomodating 102 tons of
cargo, accessed via four large cargo hatches.

	The Recollet is capable of accelerations of up to 2Gs, driven by a
Famille Spofulam Gravitics Thruster Plate unit, and boasts the longest
range (3 parsecs) jump drive currently available.

	As it is designed to venture far beyond the protective umbrella of
the Imperial Navy, the Recollet packs two 251 megajoule Ling Standard heavy
lasers linked by MFD, as well as one nuclear damper and a sandcaster.  The
Recollet\'s weapons suite therefore provides significant firepower, and is
capable of dealing with either laser or missile-equipped (typical of
lower-TL cultures) opponents.

	As typical for FSY\'s civilian craft, accomodations are luxurious;
command, sensor, flight deck, senior gunner, and engineering crew sleep in
six large staterooms, while the gunners and steward each have a single
small stateroom to themselves.  Eight small staterooms are provided for
middle passengers.  Given that the Recollet will often be operated with a
lower crew complement of three gunners (with the lasers being fired by the
MFD gunner) and no steward, up to 11 middle passengers may be carried.
Crew quarters may be shifted into smaller staterooms to accomodate High
passengers if necessary.  A sickbay is provided, as are 10 low berths.

	The result is a highly capable vessel with a surprisingly low price
tag of only 226 Mcr (launch not included) which we here at FSY feel will
become extremely popular among those venturing beyond the frontiers of the
Imperium to seek fortune, adventure, and to increase the glory of the
Imperium.

*******************************
Designer\'s comments (in no particular order):

* I wanted to keep the vessel fairly small, for role-playing reasons; I
think that the fewer NPC crew, the better.

* In designing the weapons suite, I assumed that lower-TL opponents would
likely to be relying heavily on nuke missiles for long-range offence; hence
the damper.  IMHO sandcasters also ought to be effective against missiles
too.  And the lasers could also be used as anti-missile defences.

* The 10 low berths were included a) for freezing shot-up crewmembers and
b) in case of misjump.  Low passengers might also be safer in uncivilized
parts of the universe, too.

* Crew and passenger numbers in the USD are for full complement, with
skeleton crew numbers in (parentheses).

* An option which might be popular would be to remove the hangar in favour
of cargo space, which would add 20 tons of cargo and cut 0.162 Mcr from the
ticket price.  The shops could likewise be removed, adding a further 16
tons of cargo and lowering the ticket price a further 0.27 Mcr.  However, I
think that for a vessel with a partly exploratory vocation, they\'re more
useful than the extra cargo capacity.

* Sensors crew numbers came out to 1.4, which I rounded down.  In general,
I\'ve assumed a fairly cross-trained crew.

* I think that I\'ve nailed the design specs this time.  It\'s under 3000
tons, exceeds the M & J drive specs, and is capable of wilderness
refuelling.  It\'s capable of double the 1-year field duration, landing crew
either by itself or via small craft, and (IMHO) is capable of dealing with
equal or lower-TL opponents.  And it still carries a fair amount of cargo.

IIRC the Black Sea also has a very high Hydrogen Sulphide concentration,
because the surface water ihas a very low saline level and just sits on the
saltier deep layers, with very little mixing. I wonder if a climatic chamge
could trigger a release... (global warming say) There\'s a lot of water in

Phoenix Small Arms LIC announce the availablity of the L-2 rifle.

PSA L-2 rifle
The L-2 is an advanced TL12 military rifle. The L-2 fires the standard
Imperial 7mm DS projectile (as used in the standard Imperial 7mm caseless
round) using a metered binary propellant system. The L-2 has a total loaded
weight of 3.8kg (including a 0.2kg disposable propellant cartridge and a
0.5kg 100 round detachable magazine) with an overall length of 46cm (33.9cm
barrel). The L-2 is capable of firing either 3 round burst, single shot or
full automatic (cyclic rate 1000 rpm). The L-2 has three power settings
(high, medium and low) and is a low recoil weapon suitable for zero-G
environments at the low power setting. A disposable propellant cartridge can 
provide 100 full power, 200 medium power or 800 low power charges. The L-2
has a penetration of 5 and range of medium at high power, a penetration of 4
and a range of medium at medium power and a penetration of 3 and range of
short at low power. The L-2 is fully gyrostabilised and is fitted with standard
attachment points for the use of enhanced sighting devices and under barrel
attachments. The L-2 costs Cr 2150 (including one loaded magazine and one
propellant cartridge); a fully charged propellant cartridge costs Cr 70 and
100 7mm DS projectiles cost Cr 105; additional unloaded magazines cost of
Cr 145.

this explination of nuclear damper technology which should quell questions
 The below is copyright whoever owns it, I\'m not suere atm.
- -=-
 Nuclear dampers disable nuclear warheads by preventing their warheads
from undergoing nuclear reactions. In the case of fission warheads, they
do this by transforming their fissile material into nonfissile elements,
and in the case of thermonuclear warheads, they do this by preventing the
hydrogen nuclei from fusing in thermonuclear reactions. On the other hand,
manipulating the electroweak force, which controls the decay of subatomic
particles, allows the nuclear damper to cause uranium or plutonium to
rapidly decay into nonfissile isotopes, preventing the nuclear warhead
from functioning.(Note, however, that improperly identifying a fission
warhead as a fusion warhead and firing a nuclear damper at it to weaken
the strong force will actualley cause the detonation of a fission warhead,
rather then prevent it.) For further discussion of nuclear damper
technology, see _Fire, Fusion & Steel_ pages 56-57.
- -=-

 Seems like this could also be focused on \'normal\' matter to cause it to
decay into a pile of sludge.. Disintigrator beams, anyone? Do a number on
a grav tank\'s electronics, or for long-range targeting of starships since
there is no defense against these.

   If it could alter the pion\'s mass, then sure.  Nuclear forces are
   mediated by nucleons exchanging pions.  The heavier the pions, the
   shorter the range.  A pion is made up of a quark-antiquark pair. 
   Some possible mechanisms for increasing its mass include:

   1)  Decreasing the strength of the QCD (quantum chromo-dynamics)
   coupling constant.  This would decrease the binding energy of the
   pion, increasing its mass.

   2) Alternatively, increasing the strength of the QCD coupling
   constant might work, if it increased confinement and caused the
   quark-antiquark pair to increase its zero-level energy.  Since QCD
   problems are currently incalculable, I don\'t know how to discriminate
   between this option and option (1) above.

   3) Increase the quark mass.

   Note that control of pion mass could have other interesting spin-off
   applications.  Like, say, controling pion lifetimes 8^).

Buy Marathon Infinity and draw the ships with the editor including the

feel.
Really interesting. Someone made an excellent map of a Subsidized

Failure roll where to, basically, fumble, one needs to roll as many or more

have spectacularly failed.  If your skill level is 1, you\'ll spectacularly
fail with one or more sixes.  

We discovered a bit of a problem with this.  It does a good job of making
spectacular failure a bit less likely as one\'s skill increases and it works
with low-mid level skills, but when a character has a high skill level
(say, 4 or more) it becomes impossible to spectactularly fail at simpler (3
dice or less) tasks.  Everybody (so I think) should have a chance to fail.

 Incredible infant mortailty would make a nice background touch, sorta of

That\'s what you do to determine if a floor is "flat" ot "really flat". 

But it is possible to get a *gravity* field that is "flat" (ie parallel
field lines). Just create a very dense flat plate. As long as you
aren\'t near the edges, the lines are parallel. And yes, that means that
the field strength doesn\'t drop as you move away from the plate. Not
until you get far enough away that the edge effects get noticeable.

Use a controlled implosion to create some hyperdense matter and seal it
into a few inches of diamond. Tile enough of these plates and you\'ll
get a gravity field that acts like acceleration.

Nope. But if they use the sort of "fusion smelter" I think should ber
common, it\'d basically bre a big fusion plane with something resembling
the guts of several meson guns attached (the reactor turns the rock
into plasma, the electromagnetic field modules sort the atoms by mass
and charge).

Uranium has one little known use. Most bright yellow glazes require
uranium. You can also get a nice green, and possibly an orange.

Think of a Chondrite as a cross between a lump of charcoal and a lump
of tar...

You get in visual range of a "rock" and zap it with a laser. If the
surface isn\'t uniform, zap each kind of area. A spectrograph can read
the composition of the vaporized material.

If they are available, and if they are close enough to the mainworld or

It\'s sort of like "mining" sand and gravel. There\'s always a demand,
but you won\'t get rich.

D&D. *Large* party. Whhile the front ranks were bashing on something,
the rear ranks got attacked by an ochre jelly. A magic user at that end
of the party franticly yells "what kills these?" And someone starts to
reply "Fire, or..." Mage goes "Right. I throw a fireball at it!" This
was in a 10 foot wide corridor. The fireball engulfed the whole party.
Worse, not only did the mage live thru it, the leader (actually the DM)
wouldn\'t let us off the idiot....

It\'s a cool Macintosh and PC game a la Doom but with a real story and
better graphics. It comes with two editors that lets you create maps,
textures, enemies et c. There\'s already a beautiful Subsidized merchant
that you can run around in (until the baddies shoot you down that is).

They are supposed to detect anything from microwaves to hard UV or even
x-rays and they see whatevers coming, be it reflected or radiated. I
separated IR from light/UV sensors in mys design system a while but figured
it wasn\'t worth the hassle.

That is stupid.  Consider, the less petrol that\'s left, the more room

weaponry.  The text is as follows:

"Most worlds allow non-military shipowners to install
military-specification turret and barbette weapons systems.  Missile
batteries, bay and spinal weapons are usually only available to authorized
purchasers."

  Now, not that I\'m thinking of a ship with a big honking weapon (I was
going to say something about leaving that to Famillee Spofulam, but this
time their design looks very restrained - nice work, no doubt by the new
team of designers who replaced the ones who were sacked after the last
competition), but I was wondering if the purchasers of the Exploratory
Trader were going to be "authorized" in the sense of the above quotation.
If not, the only major impact I see is that it means that MFDs for
missiles are not allowed (along with bay and spinal mounts).

  This also brings up the question of if there are other technologies that
are forbidden to civilian owners, like military grade sensors and the
like.  I\'d be interested to hear other thoughts on the matter.

Actually, death shouldn\'t be required, just a reduction in your
reproductive ability/opportunity.

So if he was disfigured and as a result produced no/fewer children
as a result, it should count.  People who get killed after they\'ve
had all the kids they\'re going to should be disqualified, though :-)

I HAD one player with a fire going on in the engineering room. Well he
thought speed was important (it was during space combat) and decided that
flooding the room with LHyd by shooting a hole in a tank wall would snuff
the fire. As the LHyd was so cold he figured it wouldn\'t ignite from the
fire. He was right about that - it ignited from the plasmabolt(!) he used
to crack the tank and was then simultaneously flashfreezed, cocussion
crushed and burned alive.

I think we have a winner.  Can you knock out a quick screenplay, and we\'ll run it by 
Marc for his approval before we pitch it to Hollywood as the Traveller movie?  I see it 
as sort of a Jaws-in-the-Far-Future, with the main character a scientist who\'s figured 
out the danger but no one believes him (I guess that\'s An Enemy of the People, too).  
Maybe we could get that guy who was in Jurassic Park and Twister.

NOMINEE #1 [San Jose Mercury News]

An unidentified man, using a shotgun like a club to break a former
girlfriend\'s windshield, accidentally shot himself to death when the
gun discharged, blowing a hole in his gut.


NOMINEE #2 [Kalamazoo Gazette, 4-1-95]

James Burns, 34, of Alamo, Mich., was killed in March as he was trying
to repair what police described as a "farm-type truck." Burns got a
friend to drive the truck on a highway while Burns hung underneath so
that he could ascertain the source of a troubling noise. Burns\'
clothes caught on something, however, and the other man found Burns
"wrapped in the drive shaft."


NOMINEE #3 [Reuters, Mississauga, Ontario]

Man slips, falls 23 stories to his death.  A man cleaning a bird
feeder on his balcony of his condominium apartment in this Toronto
suburb slipped and fell 23 stories to his death, police said Monday.
Stefan Macko, 55, was standing on a wheeled chair Sunday when the
accident occurred, said Inspector D\'Arcy Honer of the Peel regional
police. "It appears the chair moved and he went over the balcony,"
Honer said." It\'s one of those freak accidents. No foul play is
suspected."


NOMINEE #4 [Hickory Daily Record 12/21/92]

Ken Charles Barger, 47, accidentally shot himself to death in December
in Newton, N.C., when, awakening to the sound of a ringing telephone
beside his bed, he reached for the phone but grabbed instead a Smith &
Wesson .38 Special, which discharged when he drew it to his ear.


NOMINEE #5 [UPI, Toronto]

Police said a lawyer demonstrating the safety of windows in a downtown
Toronto skyscraper crashed through a pane with his shoulder and
plunged 24 floors to his death. A police spokesman said Garry Hoy, 39,
fell into the courtyard of the Toronto Dominion Bank Tower early
Friday evening as he was explaining the strength of the building\'s
windows to visiting law students. Hoy previously had conducted
demonstrations of window strength according to police reports. Peter
Lauwers, managing partner of the firm Holden Day Wilson, told the
Toronto Sun newspaper that Hoy was"one of the best and brightest"
members of the 200-man association.


NOMINEE #6 [AP, Cairo, Egypt, 31 Aug 1995 CAIRO, Egypt (AP)]

Six people drowned Monday while trying to rescue a chicken that had
fallen into a well in southern Egypt.  An 18-year-old farmer was the
first to descend into the 60-foot well.  He drowned, apparently after
an undercurrent in the water pulled him down, police said.  His sister
and two brothers, none of whom could swim well, went in one by one to
help him, but also drowned. Two elderly farmers then came to help, but
they apparently were pulled by the same undercurrent.The bodies of the
six were later pulled out of the well in the village of Nazlat Imara,
240 miles south of Cairo.  The chicken was also pulled out.  It
survived.


NOMINEE #7 [Bloomburg News Service, 25 March]

A terrible diet and room with no ventilation are being blamed for the
death of a man who was killed by his own gas. There was no mark on his
body but autopsy showed large amounts of methane gas in his system.
His diet had consisted primarily of beans and cabbage (and a couple of
other things).  It was just the right combination of foods.  It
appears that the man died in his sleep from breathing from the
poisonous cloud that was hanging over his bed.  Had he been outside or
had his windows been opened, it wouldn\'t have been fatal. But the man
was shut up in his near airtight bedroom. He was "... a big man with a
huge capacity for creating [this deadly gas]." Three of the rescuers
got sick and one was hospitalized.


NOMINEE #8 [Bloomburg News Service]

SELECTION COMMITTEE "MERIT" CANDIDATE

(because no one died)

"In retrospect, lighting the match was my big mistake.  But I was only
trying to retrieve the gerbil," Eric Tomaszewski told bemused doctors
in the Severe Burns Unit of Salt Lake City Hospital.  Eric, and his
homosexual partner, Andrew "Kiki" Fernum, had been admitted for
emergency treatment after a felching session had gone seriously wrong.
"I pushed a cardboard tube up his rectum and slipped Raggot, our
gerbil, in," he explained. "As usual, Kiki shouted out "Armageddon",
my cue that he had enough. I tried to retrieve Raggot but he wouldn\'t
come out again, so I peered in to the tube and struck a match,
thinking the light might attract him."

At a hushed press conference, a hospital spokesman described what
happened next. "The match ignited a pocket of intestinal gas and a
flame shot up the tube, igniting Mr. Tomaszewski\'s hair and severely
burning his face. It also set fire to the gerbil\'s fur and whiskers,
which in turn ignited a larger pocket of gas further up the
intestines, propelling the rodent out like a cannonball."


NOMINEE #9 [18 May 93, San Jose Mercury News]

A 24-year-old salesman from Hialeah, Fla., was killed near Lantana,
Fla., in March when his car smashed into a pole in the median strip of
Interstate 95 in the middle of the afternoon. Police said that the man
was traveling at 80  MPH and, judging by the sales manual that was
found open and clutched to his chest, had been busy reading.


NOMINEE #10 [1/29/96 The News of the weird.] JOINT NOMINEE

Michael Anderson Godwin made News of the Weird posthumously in 1989.
He had spent several years awaiting South Carolina\'s electric chair on
a murder conviction before having his sentence reduced to life in
prison.

In March 1989, sitting on a metal toilet in his cell and attempting to
fix his small TV set, he bit into a wire and was electrocuted.

On Jan. 1, 1997, Laurence Baker, also a convicted murderer once on
death row, but later serving a life sentence at the state prison in
Pittsburgh, Pa., was electrocuted by his homemade earphones as he
watched his small TV while sitting on his metal toilet.


NOMINEE #11 ["The Indianapolis Star", Wed., Dec. 4, 1996].

A Jay County man using a cigarette lighter to check the barrel of a
muzzleloader was killed Monday night when the weapon discharged in his
face, sheriff\'s investigators said.  Gregory David Pryor, 19, died in
his parents\' rural Dunkirk home about 11:30 p.m.  Investigators said
Pryor was cleaning  a .54-caliber muzzleloader that had not been
firing properly.  He was using the lighter to look into the barrel
when the gunpowder ignited.


NOMINEE #12 [AP, Mammoth Lakes]

A San Anselmo man died yesterday when he hit a lift tower at the
Mammoth Mountain ski area while riding down the slope on a foam pad,
authorities said. Matthew David Hubal, 22, was pronounced dead at
Centinela Mammoth Hospital.  The accident occurred about 3 a.m., the
Mono County Sheriff\'s Department said.  Hubal and his friends
apparently had hiked up a ski run called Stump Alley and undid some
yellow foam protectors from the lift towers, said Lieutenant Mike
Donnelly of the Mammoth Lakes Police Department.  The pads are used to
protect skiers who might hit the towers. The group apparently used the
pads to slide down the ski slope and Hubal crashed into a tower. It
was not clear if the tower he hit was one with its pad removed. "With
the cold temperatures, the snow was probably pretty fast," said
Donnelly.


NOMINEE #13 [Reuters, Warsaw, Poland, 5 May 1995]

A poacher electrocuting fish in a lake in central Poland fell into the
water and suffered the same fate as his quarry, police said Thursday.

The 24-year-old man was one of four who went fishing with a cable, one
end of which they attached to a net and the other to a high-voltage
electricity supply line, the PAP news agency quoted a police official
in Wloclawek as saying. "For a while everything went according to the
poachers\' plan and they had fish in their bags. But at a certain
moment the man holding the net tripped and  fell into the water," the
agency said. The other poachers tried in vain to revive  him, it said.


NOMINEE #14 [AP, St. Louis]

Robert Puelo, 32, was apparently being disorderly in a St. Louis 
market.

When the clerk threatened to call police, Puelo grabbed a hot dog,
shoved it in his mouth, and walked out without paying for it. Police
found him unconscious in front of the store: paramedics removed the
six-inch wiener from his throat, where it had choked him to death.


NOMINEE 15 [Unknown]

To poacher Marino Malerba, who shot a stag standing above him on an
overhanging rock-- and was killed instantly when it fell on him.


NOMINEE 16 [Associated Press, Kincaid, W. VA]

Blasting Cap Explodes in Man\'s Mouth at Party.  A man at a party
popped a blasting cap into his mouth and bit down, triggering an
explosion that blew off his lips, teeth and tongue, state police said
Wednesday.

Jerry Stromyer, 24, of Kincaid, bit the blasting cap as a prank during
a party late Tuesday night, said Cpl. M.D.Payne. "Another man had it
in an aquarium, hooked to a battery, and was trying to explode it,"
Payne said. "It wouldn\'t go off and this guy said, \'I\'ll show you how
to set it off\'. I just can\'t imagine anyone doing something like
that," Payne said.


NOMINEE #17 [Fort Worth Star-Telegram, 1-1-93]

In December near Mineral Wells, Tex., three men who were attempting to
steal copper wire off live electrical lines for resale were
electrocuted.

Copper wiring is a valuable scrap metal in Texas but is usually stolen
from electric cables that are not being used.


========================================


Here are some people that may be future nominees/winners, but still
haven\'t made it to the "Big Leagues":


[UPI, Portland, OR]

Doctors at Portland\'s University Hospital said Wednesday an Oregon man
shot through the skull by a hunting arrow is lucky to be alive, and
will be released soon from the hospital.  Tony Roberts, 25, lost his
right eye last weekend during an initiation into a men\'s rafting club,
Mountain Men Anonymous, in Grants Pass, Ore. A friend tried to shoot a
beer can off his head, but the arrow entered  Roberts\' right eye.

Doctors said had the arrow gone 1 millimeter to the left, a major
blood vessel would have cut and Roberts would have died instantly.

Neurosurgeon Dr. Johnny Delashaw at the University Hospital in
Portland said the arrow went through 8 to 10 inches of brain, with the
tip protruding at the rear of his skill, yet somehow managed to miss
all major blood vessels. Delashaw also said had Robert tried to pull
the arrow out on his own he surely would have killed himself.  Roberts
admitted afterwards he and his friends had been drinking that 
afternoon.

Said Roberts, "I feel so dumb about this."

No charges have been filed but the Josephine County district
attorney\'s office said the initiation stunt is under investigation.


VANCOUVER (CP)

A man arguing over a love triangle accidently shot himself in the
groin, taking off his testicles and part of his penis. Police said the
man was waving a .357 Magnum revolver around during the shouting match
early yesterday. But when he stuffed it back in his pants the gun went
off.

Police were called to the hospital after the man in his 20s was
brought in by friends. Charges are pending against the victim, who is
expected to survive.


Arkansas Democrat Gazette, July 25, 1996:

Two local men were seriously injured when their pick-up truck left the
road and struck a tree near Cotton Patch on State Highway 38 early
Monday morning. Woodruff County deputy Dovey Snyder reported the
accident shortly after midnight Monday. Thurston Poole, 33, of Des Arc
and Billy Ray Wallis, 38, of Little Rock are listed in serious
condition at Baptist Medical Center.  The accident  occurred as the
two men were returning to Des Arc after a frog gigging trip. On an
overcast Sunday night, Poole\'s pick-up truck headlights malfunctioned.
The two men concluded that the headlight fuse on the older model truck
had burned out.  As a replacement fuse was not available, Wallis
noticed that the .22 caliber bullet from his pistol fit perfectly into
the fuse box next to the steering wheel column.  Upon inserting the
bullet, the headlights again began to operate properly and the two men
proceeded on east-bound toward the WhiteRiver bridge.

After traveling approximately twenty miles and just before crossing
the river, the bullet apparently overheated, discharged and struck
Poole in the right testicle. The vehicle swerved sharply to the right
exiting the pavement and striking a tree.

Poole suffered only minor cuts and abrasions from the accident, but
will require surgery to repair the other wound.  Wallis sustained a
broken clavicle  and was treated and released.  "Thank God we weren\'t
on that bridge when Thurston shot his nuts off or we might both be
dead" stated Wallis.

"I\'ve been a trooper for ten years in this part of the world, but this
is a first for me. I can\'t believe that those two would admit how this
accident happened", said Snyder.

Upon being notified of the wreck, Lavinia, Poole\'s wife asked how many
frogs the boys had caught and did anyone get them from the truck.

EA is a Good Thing.  Well written, great art.. it\'s what we\'ve been waiting
for.  

The book is a collection of weapons (duh!) grouped by TL, from 0 to 16,
with essays on everything from ammo costs to nuclear weapons.  The writing
is clear and to the point, given fromt he point of view of the editor of
Carnak\'s Surface Weapons.  The weapons provided cover the range from body
pistols, to plasma weapons, to Battle Dress.. you\'ll find something for
every campaign style here.

The art needs to be mentioned.  Bryon Gibson has captured the essence of
what we were debating a few months back- his art is "Travelleresque."  You
get that "Keith brothers era" feeling from the drawings, along with a good
visual reference for what you are carrying.

Buy it.

    'topic' => 'More VilaniWorld stuff',
    'body' => 'Here are some random notes on the Traveller Theme Park.
I\'m currently toying with the idea to get players involved with one
of these. My current group is quite small, and counts two technicians
and an ex-army characters.

One possibility I\'m considering is to have them contracted as
specialized manpower during the *building* of one of these sites.
This could possibly give a lot of very short and varied scenarios
(and yes, I\'d like some input on this).

The idea behind Vilaniworld (ok, I\'m working on an alternate name) is
that even if PC\'s routinely engage in space flights, fight aliens,
pirates and the police in incredibly hostile and bizzarre
environments, more than 90% of the Imperial population still works
and lives on Earth-like planets and lives pretty normal lives, after
all.
Ok, mommy may have been drafted in the Marines and daddy actually
worked on a Subsidized Merchant when he was young, but they have
settled now, or perhaps they never visited really interesting planets
during their careers ... so Vilaniworld may have something to offer
to them, too.

First of all, when you get your electronic pass at the entrance you
must register as a member of one of the "services". You may decide to
be Scout, Navy, Marine or Merchant. The staff will oblige and give
you a fake id and a cap (like a baseball cap) with a distinctive colour and
the name of the service emblazoned on it.
From this point on, the staff, robots and computer-driven attractions
will react to your assumed service by referring to you by proper
rank/service designation.  Some of the attractions will react in
slightly different ways depending on the service you choosed. Others
will allow you to advance in rank when completed... and you will go
home with fake insignia and certificates.
Another idea is that the credit-card size ticket you got at the
entrance may also act as a map, let you buy stuff, give info on the
park and inform you of the length of queues for the various
attractions.

Here is a small lists of the "Classical Themes". For a couple of them
I\'ve also described one of the attractions.

_StarTown_
The obvious starting point. It simulates a romanticized view of the
typical StarTown, with a lot of buildings hosting bars, restaurant
and shops. From this zone you may reach the other themes through some
aptly themed building (research lab, shuttle station and so on).

_WaterLand_
A section inspired by the Waterworld environment. Obviously it will
not be present in parks built on *actual* waterworlds.
The main feature is a large lake with a smattering of small atolls
on it; you can take rides on various kinds of waterships and engage
in seaside activities. During the cruise you will meet/spot real or
fake marine creatures.

_"DeepCity 9"_ (Waterland Attraction)
On the edge of the lake there is a building which let you experiment
the "undersea life".  A special machine will instantly produce for
you a fully enclosed suit you can wear over your dress. The personnel
helps you with the suit, gives you a transparent helmet, secures a
"breathing/mobile" unit on your back, give you some simple advice on
how to guide the thing and down you go.
Even with the high TL, security risks could be too high, so all the
underwater environment is just a clever a simulation. Actually you
descend in an underground complex which has been built in the ground
facing away from the lake; the elevator which takes you down to the
"pressure chamber" conceals this fact by slowly rotating you away from
the lake during the descent.  The area in which you "float/swim" is a
near-0g zone (thanks to anti-g plates) and you are actually propelled
by air-jets from your back-unit. This way you move in a simulate
environment without the risk of getting drowned. The worst possible
disaster is a failure in the anti-g apparatus in one of the sections.
In this case people would fall down, but the "undersea" environment
is built as a series of caves and corals banks, with plenty of
artificial seaweeds, sandy patches and other passive failsafe systems
which will help reduce the damage down to bruises.  Obviously the
simulation wil be enhanced by high TL gimmicks: holograms will add
air bubbles, plancton-like life forms, distant fish schools and so
on.
The helmet contains a small radio which allows you to talk with your
friends/family and receive audio/video info on the environment you
are in through a simplified HUD display. Internal audio effects will
enhance the idea of actually being underwater.  People with scuba or
related skills will probably notice small telltale details, but the
majority of people will probably fall for it. Especially childs.
Following the various "lanes" you will be able to explore a
shipwreck, chase around small (robot) creatures and finally enter an
"underwater lab" (where g is restored to normal levels) in which you
may take off your helmet, visit interesting exhibition on waterworld
colonization, buy gizmos at the "Lab Shop" and have a drink at the
DeepBlue cafeteria.  Leaving the Lab, you will put your helmet on
again, and follow another (brief) route to the exit, when the suit
will be taken from you (and his plastic fibers will be 100% recycled
for the next visitor). The helmet will be sanitized and re-sent to
the entrance.

_SpaceLand_
Star Travel theme. Lot of Imperial Navy stuff. Careful choice of
BEMs: they must *not* resemble known members of the Imperium
population. Space Pirates.

_Star Raiders_ (Spaceland Attraction)
You must be at least 12 years old to take this ride.  Visitors are
divided in groups of 10-12 people and lead around a replica of a
medium size starship. During the trip inside g-plates and videos will
sustain the simulation that the starship is actually leaving the
planet. During the simulated voyage, an alarm signal will go off, and
the guide will scream "Oh No! The Star Raiders! We are under attack".
S/he will hastily open a locker and distribute (fake) laser weapons
to all the people.  After a brief (simulated) space skirmish with a
lot of explosions, battle reports over the intercom and a lot of
flickering lights, the group will have to defend the ship\'s corridors
from a boarding party. The party is made up of robots wearing an
armor not unlike the one used by Star Wars stormtroopers... all the
scene could remind you of the opening battle of the first Star Wars
movie, in fact. Obviously the enemy will exhibit the classical
stormtrooper incompetence in aiming shots against the visitors, but
their weaponry will have plenty of effect against (selected) parts of
the corridors and other ship fixtures. After 2-3 minutes of general
mayhem, the surviving invaders will flee, and the ship will "return
to base" where people will get their plastic medals.

_HomeLand_
Through the research lab you may enter the "Experimental Time
Machine" which will dazzle you with fantastic scenery and hologram
animations... and then will open its gate to the Local Culture zone.
Here attractions are linked to local cultural influences and try to
depict familiar themes and ideas from the planetary history. People
and robots will have appropriate costumes and lifelike replicas of
famous people from the past will wander around (and sign your
autograph book...) These are mostly robots, and are backed by well
researched historical databanks on the figure they portrait, so you
can actually have some interesting chat with them.

_Ancientland_
History (and some myth) on the Ancients. Includes a couple of
fictional Ancient sites to explore/visit.

**********************************************

DARWIN AWARD WINNER FOR 1997 ANNOUNCED:  You all know about the Darwin
Awards - it\'s an annual honor given to the person who did the gene
pool the biggest service by killing themselves in the most
extraordinarily stupid way.  The 1995 winner was the fellow who was
killed by a coke machine which toppled over on top of him as he was
attempting to tip a free soda out of it.  In 1996, the winner was an
Air Force Sergeant who attached a jet engine (JATO) unit to his car
and crashed into a cliff several hundred feet above the road.  And
now, the 1997 winner:  Larry Waters of Los Angeles - one of the few
Darwin winners to survive his award-winning accomplishment.

Larry\'s boyhood dream was to fly.  When he graduated from high school,
he joined the Air Force in hopes of becoming a pilot.  Unfortunately,
poor eyesight disqualified him.  When he was finally discharged, he
had to satisfy himself with watching Jets fly over his backyard.  One
day, Larry had a bright idea.  He decided to fly.  He went to the
local Army-navy surplus store and purchased 45 weather balloons and
several tanks of helium.  The weather balloons, when fully inflated,
would measure more than four feet across.  Back home, Larry securely
strapped the weather balloons to his sturdy lawn chair.

He anchored the chair to the bumper of his Jeep and inflated the
balloons with the helium.  He climbed on for a test while it was still
only a few feet above the ground.

Satisfied it would work, Larry packed several sandwiches and a
six-pack of Miller Lite, loaded his pellet gun - figuring he could pop
a few balloons when it was time to descend - and went back to the
floating lawn chair.  He tied himself in along with his pellet gun and
provisions.  Larry\'s plan was to lazily float up to a height of about
30 feet above his back yard after severing the anchor and in a few
hours come back down.

Things didn\'t quite work out that way.

When he cut the cord anchoring the lawn chair to his jeep, he didn\'t
float lazily up to 30 or so feet.  Instead he streaked into the L.A.
sky as if shot from a cannon.

He didn\'t level off at 30 feet, nor did he level off at 100 feet.
After climbing and climbing, he levelled off at 11,000 feet.  At that
height he couldn\'t risk shooting any of the balloons, lest he
unbalance the load and really find himself in trouble.  so he stayed
there, drifting, cold and frightened, for more than 14 hours.

Then he really got in trouble.

He found himself drifting into the primary approach corridor of Los
Angeles International Airport.

A United pilot first spotted Larry.  He radioed the tower and
described passing a guy in a lawn chair with a gun.  Radar confirmed
the existence of an object floating 11,000 feet above the airport.

LAX emergency procedures swung into full alert and a helicopter was
dispatched to investigate.

LAX is right on the ocean.  Night was falling and the offshore breeze
began to blow.  It carried Larry out to sea with the helicopter in hot
pursuit.

Several miles out, the helicopter caught up with Larry.  Once the crew
determined that Larry was not dangerous, they attempted to close in
for a rescue but the draft from the blades would push Larry away
whenever they neared.

Finally, the helicopter ascended to a position several hundred feet
above Larry and lowered a rescue line. Larry snagged the line and was
hauled back to shore. The difficult maneuver was flawlessly executed
by the helicopter crew.

As soon as Larry was hauled to earth, he was arrested by waiting
members of the LAPD for violating LAX airspace.

As he was led away in handcuffs, a reporter dispatched to cover the
daring rescue asked why he had done it.  Larry stopped, turned and
replied nonchalantly, "A man can\'t just sit around".

Let\'s hear it for Larry Waters, the 1997 Darwin Award winner.

Bill, have you tried using 3 sixes as SF?  That\'s what I use with 
KBv2.0, and the percentages aren\'t that bad (around 10% for 
Impossible throws--less for the other categories).

There are two good things about doing it this way.  One is that the 
chance of SF goes up the harder task you attempt.  I like that, and 
it seems logical that your chance of royally screwing up should be 
greater if you are trying a really hard feat.

Second, this is exactly what T4-revised is using.  I like to keep the 
rule changes to a minimum.

And, if you think about it, this actually works better with KBv2.0 
than it does with T4-revised because SF can be done with Average and 
higher skill throws.  With T4-revised, you have to attempt a 
Formidable task before you can throw SF.

If you ask me, there should be a chance for SF way before you get to 
Formidable--like Average and Difficult throws.

Aftermath! rather than Traveller.
 Two PCs were clearing out a house, one outside (PC1) covering the exit,
one inside (PC2) sweeping through.
 Much scuffling and gunfire inside.
PC1 "Are you OK in there?"
PC2 "Yeah, I\'m fine. Out of ammo, though!"

PC2 did survive, though (through no fault of his own :)

History: Born in AD 1963 in a mountainous, agricultural region of the
North American continent on Terra (Kentucky), his parents soon moved to
a more industrial region (Ohio) in search of work, which his father
found as machine operator in a factory.  Harold grew up in a middle
class suburban household, learning some of the ways of his ancestors,
but seemed more drawn toward academic pursuits, particularly the
military and political history of Terra.  Only occasionally gaining
academic recognition, he was known as a bright, but somewhat
undisciplined student who was just as likely to study a subject that
caught his fancy as he was his coursework (which may account for his
undistinguished academic career).  Even today, he is known to spend many
hours with his nose in a book or in front of a computer terminal in
search of knowledge about a particular topic or some bit of trivia, a
talent (?) he later made into a career.  Beginning college at age 17, he
also enlisted in the Army Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) with the
idea of one day becoming an officer on active duty.  A better student of
military science than a warrior, he settled for a hitch in the Army
Reserve, where he was trained as a short range air defense artillery
officer, but because of a shortage of slots, actually served in mostly
administrative posts until leaving the service several years later. 
While attending college, he met and eventually wed his wife Elaine, who
was also student.  Twelve years later Harold is still mystified how she
puts up with him.  Also while attending college, he discovered work in
libraries.  Fascinated by the knowledge that surrounded him on a daily
basis (and thankful he would no longer run up astronomical library
fines), he started as a student assistant at one the university\'s
libraries, and has continued to pursue work in the field ever since,
holding a variety of positions at an assortment of institutions,
including running his own library for the branch of a
defense-contracting corporation.  Today, he lives in the same region
that he grew up, and works for another defense-contractor, serving in
the capacity of research coordinator for a staff of six.  He is heard to
refer to his supervisor as being a "micromanaging pseudo-intellectual"
so a another job change may be in order soon (Resume and references
available upon request).    

Science-Fiction History: Grew up watching "Outer Limits" (I\'m told I was
fascinated by it at a very early age, new series doesn\'t measure up to
the old one), and "Twilight Zone", later "Battlestar Galactica", "Star
Wars", and of course "Star Trek" (which I don\'t remember in first run,
but certainly caught in re-runs until I memorized most episodes
including sections of dialogue), other TV shows and films too numerous
to mention.  I wasn\'t into reading science-fiction particularly until
college (my reading time went into history, though I read "Star Wars"
before I saw it on the big screen), where I discovered Arthur C.
Clarke.  I prefer short stories to novels, as I like to finish pieces in
one sitting (this made reading Harry Turtledove\'s "Guns of the South" a
challenge--I cheated and took three days).  Started playing Traveller
about 1981 or 82 (my long time friend John is a bit fuzzy on the date as
well).  Used the "little black books" up until 1987, when MegaTraveller
came out.  Bought MegaTraveller and hated it, not because of the
storyline so much (which I would have prefered something else) as the
rather poor quality of the editing, which spoiled the game for me.  My
gaming group broke up about this time, and I basically stopped playing
and put the books away for a year until 1989 while I was living in
California.  It was then I started thinking about submitting work to
Game Designers\' Workshop (still no gaming group).  Sent some initial
query letters that weren\'t answered.  After moving back to Ohio in 1990,
I finally got serious and completed a large work on designing drone
missiles/robots for MegaTraveller.  Submitted to GDW in 1992, never
published.  It did get me an invitation to the first (and as it turns
out, only) GDW Traveller Writer\'s Conference, held in Bloomington,
Illinois in the summer of 1992.  The basic concepts for Traveller the
New Era were introduced at this conference.  I went on to consult with
Dave, Loren, et al on a continuing basis over the next four years
concerning TNE and its development.  Submitted more work for
publication, including "Playland", and adventure published in Challenge
76, several small arms and two attack speeder designs which were
published in the RC Equipment Guide, among others.  Developed the
"Children of Earth: The Solomani Rim In the New Era" setting which GDW
contemplated publishing before instead decided to go ahead with
development of the Regency (which may have been just as well--COE needed
a lot more at the time).  COE would eventually appear in Traveller
Chronicle as a regular feature after GDW went under (thanks Kevin, sorry
Dave, Loren, Frank, et al).  Starting running a gaming group again in
1993, with two friends and myself playing TNE, now group consists of
seven friends and myself playing TNE and Star Wars RPG.  Joined the
History of the Imperium Working Group in 1992.  Became its Chairman
(title formerly \'Chairsophont\' which I changed by decree as I am a
member of the Solomani Party) in 1995.  Looked to chart a new course for
the organization.

Science-Fiction Present: I\'m working on additional COE stuff as I type,
and the COE Web site is now operational.  I\'m a member of the fan group
trying to bring back "Space: Above and Beyond" (a lost cause, but at
least we got the Sci-Fi Channel to pick up the reruns starting in 1998),
and a member of a fan group trying to keep TNE alive (not a lost
cause).  Bought T4 basic book in August 1996, talked with Marc Miller
concerning the direction he planned to take the game (thanks Marc). 
After reading the basic manual, leafing through several supplements at
game stores, and listening to other people\'s comments on T4 (not just
here but elsewhere), I have concluded that IG\'s T4 is turning out to be
a replay of MegaTraveller.  I have no desire to support it further
monetarily or creatively.  While I hope that Marc\'s "T4.5" is better,
and I am open to doing some writing for it (and willing consult with
anyone working on a major overhaul of the system), my gaming group and I
still prefer a slightly revised TNE (with mods made in light of
experience) over anything Marc or IG (or anyone else) have planned for
"T4.5".

Science-Fiction Future: COE on the big screen?  Bloody unlikely, but an
illustrated novel would be nice (must find an illustrator gullible
enough or insane enough to work for free until idea can be sold). 
Beyond that, maybe some writing outside the boundaries of Traveller. 
We\'ll see as they say....

Regards,

Harold

	Yup.  JMS signed for 3 two-hour movies with the TNT network.  This

	Cool stuff!

	Speaking of cable, anyone see the two LEXX: Darkzone Story movies
on Showtime?  They are *horrible*.  Interesting production designs (in
some rare cases), but bad acting and bad writing.  There are two more

Cool. Or rather: hot.

BTW: Seems I mis-remembered the process behind my \'spontaneous natural
nuclear reactions\'. Here it is from the source, _Timescale: An Atlas of the
Fourth Dimension_ (one of my all-time favourite books - can\'t recommend it
highly enough), by Nigel Calder, page 110:

Circa 2000 million years ago, during Earth\'s \'oxygen revolution\':

"In a bizarre side effect, the oxygen mobilized uranium compounds in the
water, and bacteria stockpiled them in ores. Fissile uranium-235 was much
commoner than it is today, and rich ores became natural nuclear reactors.
In western Africa 2000 million years ago, chain reactions consumed several
tons of uranium-235 in one small district."

In his glossary/reference section, he clarifies (page 283):

"At Oklo in Gabon, Africa, some compact bodies of rich uranium ore engaged
in spontaneous chain reactions which consumed at least six tons of
uranium-235 and released the usual mess of fission products (R. Bodu, et
al. _Comptes Rendus_, Vol.275, p.275; J.R. DeLaeter, et al., _Earth and
Planetary Science Letters_, Vol. 50, 1980, p.238)."

I would assume that Traveller characters are only likely to encounter this
sort of thing on planets with rather higher heavy-metals content than
Terra. Or much younger planets.

8000 credits is almost a full yearly income for an average citizen. That

This message goes out to those people in IRC land (U know who U R!). 
 Especialy those who I game with on a regular basis(Allen, Suz).  This was 
the best way I could reach eveybody in one swell foop! :)

I have recently moved into a new house with the rest of my clan.  While we 
have power and I can use my PC for gaming, we still do not have the phones 
transfered yet.  Also the ISP bill was up and hasn\'t been paid because of 
the move.  As a result, It may be a week, possibly 2 before I can get home 
net access again.  The clan is currently working on the problem, but the 
fact is that the move ravaged our bank account, and I don\'t get paid until 
next Friday! :(

But at least I still have office access! :)

Allen, sorry about the LWH game, but I believe we were going to reschedule 
the time anyway right?

Suz, It may be a while before I can get access to the cmdrx@magicnet.net 
mail for the PBEM.

But as I seem to have nothing else better to do at work, I WILL be working 
on the next THUDDD entry as e-mail is not a problem.  As a matter of fact...


<CHR MODE ON>

125-0020 DSS-X \'Planet X\' (2116 Core/Core AX00613-C)

X-TEK Diversifies into the civilian/commercial market.

In response to the THUDDD ship design contest sanctioned by the ISBA, The 
Commander announced that X-TEK should begin to diversify into the commercial 
sector.  "We have proven ourselves as an excellent source of millitary and 
paramillitary starships and systems.  As we now have created some ways to 
help the Imperium defend its borders, we must now embrace the commercial 
side of Cleon\'s dream.  If X-TEK is to remain competative, it must spread 
itself into the commercial sector as well as millitary."  The Commander then 
displayed a holovid of the next line of merchnat ships:

The Marco Class Trader, 100Td Wedge. Designed for the solitary trader.
The Solo Class Trader, 200Td Disc. Basic Stock Freighter, minimal componets 
but can be upgraded easily.
The Leo Class Heavy Trader 600Td

and for THUDDD

The Elizabeth Class 1000Td Exploritory Trader.

Named after an ancient Solomani Queen, during a time when wooden ships 
needed to be able to carry heavy amounts of gold and treasure from the newly 
found lands, and defend that rich capital from pirates and rival Kingdoms. 
 The Elizabeth Class lives up to those times, as we now find ourselves in a 
similar situation some 3000 in the future.  The Elizabeth will be able to go 
to the far reatches of our Empire, recontact lost worlds and begin trade. 
 It will be able to cary tons of valuable cargo To and from those worlds and 
protect it from would be pirates and rival Pocket Empires who would steal 
from the coffers of the Empire.  It is the hope of X-TEK that this design 
marks the fusion between corporate commercial know how, and X-TEK\'s strong 
military backing, in producing a viable vehicle for commerce.

The Commander also anounced the incorporation of two smaller, lower tech 
corporations.  Kor-El shipyards, based in Zarushagar Sector (subsector D). A 
specialist in low tech (TL 10+) Merchant Ships.  And Pegasus Technologies, 
makers of In-system  craft and primative starships (TL 8-9).  Both companies 
are actualy "Bootstrap" companies funded by X-TEK on low tech worlds in the 
Zarushagar Sector.

Physical Description:
     Aurora is a fairly pleasant world. It has a rather mild weather
pattern, with only occasional tropical storms. Its low axial tilt give
it a fairly mild seasonal pattern.  The temperature only drops around
10 degrees in the winter.  

     The one draw back of the planet is the high carbon dioxide levels
in the atmosphere.  This requires all offworld species to wear oxygen
masks.  Humans can survive without a mask for a few minutes, but after
that most people tend to pass out, and eventually die of oxygen
deprivation.  All native buildings and vehicles are sealed, so that
masks are only required when going outside.  Most vehicles are stored
in sealed garages, connected to the main dwelling, so that most
residents don\'t have to go outside, unless that is their destination. 
The residents don\'t fear the outdoors, many of them do go outside to
take walks and to enjoy nature.  
     
      The increased carbon dioxide has lead to a greenhouse effect
where the sun\'s rays are trapped in the atmosphere and heat it.  This
has raised the average temperature about 10 degrees.  The median
temperature for the planet is 26 C (79 F).

      Travellers landing at the capital\'s starport, will find a planet
that is sunny, with mild winters.  Most days the temperature is in the
upper twenties, and humid.  (This is very close to the weather in
Florida or Southeast US in the summer.)

      The planet is several billion years old, and has had enough time
to develop a fairly sophisticated ecosystem.  There is no sentient
life, but there are many species of mammalian life.  The biosphere is
quite similar to human norms.  Humans are able to eat most native
lifeforms with little worry.  This is very fortunate, because most
Terran stock animals don\'t take well to having to wear oxygen masks.  A
few off-world species have been genetically engineered to survive the
native air.  Most of these species are capable of breathing either
Auroran or Terran air levels.  

      Other than the atmosphere, the planet resembles a Terran standard
planet.  There are tree like plants, the sky is blue and clouds are
white and puffy.  There is no local equivalent of grass, most yards are
covered with a green moss like plant.  It does have the advantage of
not growing very fast and needing little maintenance.  

History:
    Before the Final War Aurora was a colony of Macis, which is now called 
Apollo.  The Collapse severed ties between the two worlds.  Resenting the 
fact that their planet was formerly owned by the Macins, Aurora became a 
democracy, and to this day they resent strong governmental controls.  The 
effects of the Collapse were severe, but the Aurorans banded together
and by making a concerted effort were able to rebuild.  By 1170 Aurora
had regained her old Tech Level, and had begun to advance past it. The
planet reached TL-10 around 1189 and reached its current state at TL-11
only in the last few years.  If the economy sustains itself at current
levels, the planet should be able to reach a global technological level
of 12 sometime around 1210.   It didn\'t have the capacity to build jump
drives, so it was forced to remain isolated.  In 1192, the Hivers made
contact, and Aurora was able to purchase jump drives.  It was a charter
member of the Dawn League, and an early proponent of the Reformation
Coalition.  Aurora has become a staunch supporter of the Federalists,
feeling that a strong extra-planetary government would take away the
freedoms that individual worlds now possess.

Government							
				 
    After the collapse, when Galos was cut off from Macis, the newly
freed people created a government which they hoped was as close to a
pure democracy as is possible. Voting is required in all elections of
all people who have reached a majority. The voting age is 17 standard
years.  The mandatory voting requires that each voter go to the polling
place, but they can enter a vote for no one.  The founders wanted
everyone to think about who should run the government, even if they
decided no one was worthy. Candidates for public office are given free
time on the government owned holovid channel. When there is no
election, this channel legislative sessions, news conferences and other
public affairs.  Candidates also make use of the worldwide computer
network, uploading transcripts of speeches, position papers, and even
digitized video of rallies.  There are no campaign donations.  All the
work of the campaign must be done by volunteers.  The founders figured
if a candidate can\'t get a few hundred
people to help him out, then the candidate probably couldn\'t win an election anyway.

     To get on the ballot, a candidate much have a petition signed. The
number of signatures required, depends on the office being sought.  These
petitions are circulated electronically.  Each signature is authenticated
by a electronic stamp, which each signer attaches to the petition.  The
stamps are a two step process, with the government holding one part, and
the citizen holding the other part.  No one has ever successfully managed
to forge a stamp.  The penalties for attempting to do so are extremely 
harsh, since such an attempt attacks the very foundation of Auroran society.
    Most candidates are members of a political party, these parties help
their candidates organize volunteers and the members of the party are a key
to filling out the petitions.  There are three major parties, the
People\'s Party, the Democratic Front, and the Union of Freedom.  These
make up 70% of the voters, the exact division can fluctuate, but is
usually fairly even.
There are six minor parties which make up 25% of the vote. These are the
Blue & White Party, the Liberty Party, the Saldorian Party, the People\'s
Democratic Party, the Free Democrats and the Worker\'s Union.  All these
parties have Federalist Sympathies, except for the Blue & White party.
It advocates that the Reformation Coalition needs a strong central
government and that all member states of the Coalition should be
required to be run by democratic governments.  The party has organized
several trips to worlds that have much less of a democratic tradition,
in an effort to create a grass roots movement.  They sent a mission to
Ra, which was thrown off planet.  In 1200 they sent a mission to
Oriflamme, which was denied entrance.  Their mission to Phoebus in
1201, was allowed to land, but the natives of Phoebus, are too
concerned with their next meal to worry about politics.  The Blues &
the Whites use these failures to raise money back home on Aurora. 
Secretly they expect them to fail and only initiate them to create
publicity.  They have much more quietly sent mission to Fija and Aubaine.  

     The central Auroran government is set up as a parliamentary system.
It has one legislative chamber made up of the people\'s chosen
representatives.   The chamber is known as the senate. The ruling
coalition chooses a prime minister, who chooses a cabinet and sets
policy.  The ruling coalition also selects a Senate President, who is
charge of running the senate\'s legislative agenda.  

      Currently the ruling coalition is made up of the Union of
Freedom, the Democratic Front, the Saldorian Party and the Free Democrats.  In total
they hold a slim 3% majority.  Assemblyman MacBaen, Aurora\'s representative
in the Assembly of Worlds is a member of the Union of Freedom. Planetary
elections are held every three standard years. The campaigning season
starts approximately six months before the elections. The last election
was held in 1200. There are 210 members of parliament.  The planet is
divided into districts of equal population. Each district elects its
own member of parliament.  The districts are redrawn every nine years,
to take account of any population movements. These are usually fairly
small changes, and they don\'t effect politics to any significant
degree.  The Auroran populace is fairly stable and doesn\'t seem to move
around a great deal. Municipal elections are held at the same time as
planetary elections. The exact details of these depend on the
municipality.  The representative to the Assembly of Worlds is also
chosen at this time, in the only planet-wide election.

Society:
     Popular culture on Aurora is dominated by the extreme technophilia
of its citizens.  As soon as a new technological innovation is developed
or readied for market, it instantly becomes the next hot item.  To fulfill
this craving for technological gizmos, hundreds of small labs and
engineering firms have sprung up to try to create the next hot item.
Many of these labs, merely redevelop items that were common on high
tech worlds in the old Imperium.  Most of the plans for these were
destroyed in the Collapse.  To get working examples of high tech goods,
these firms send buyers to the Auction. The buyers try to find useful
consumer goods that they can purchase, and have their labs copy.  Items
that have proven useful in the past include Triton Technologies\'
portable holophone, where not just voice, not just image, but a full
holographic image of the sender is beamed to the user\'s wrist unit. 
Another is Donner & Associates 80x holographic data crystal system. One
of the more popular recent items to hit the market is Verotech\'s Proton
Motorcycle.  This item is on the very cutting edge of technology, it
uses the next level in fusion+ technology, allowing the motorcycle to
reach speeds in excess of 700kph.  

     The pace of these developments has accelerated since the creation
of the Dawn League, as more and more examples of high tech devices come
to the planet.  This has lead to some to question the wisdom of this
frenzy to acquire newer and better devices.  Most people have not paid
much attention to these nay sayers, but they are a growing voice in
academic discussions.  The constant production of new products has
created a surplus of older slightly used systems.  Several companies
have begun purchasing these, and shipping them to other less developed
worlds.  Popular destinations include Ra, Baldur, Nike Nimbus and
Lancer.  They have started some shipments to worlds out in the wilds
such as Xexor.  
 
     The Auroran people recognize that education is the key to their
success in the technological fields.  The government has set up a
wonderful school system, and attendance is free to all.  These schools
are extremely high quality and Auroran students are gaining an
excellent reputation across the Coalition.  This education starts at
age three, and goes post graduate work.  All fees are paid for by the
state and stipends are paid to students. Some students find the
academic experience so wonderful that they never want to leave. This
has created the so called professional students, people much older than
the average college student, who earn degree after degree without
entering the job market.  In recent years, this government has cracked
down on the professional students, requiring that students over age 25
maintain a high academic standing or lose their stipends, but those who
are able to achieve them are welcome to stay.  Professional students
are often a bit eccentric but are good-naturedly tolerated because of
their recognized abilities.  The many new and interesting
opportunities the economic expansion and tech advancement have created
have drawn many professional students into more "productive" pursuits where they
have proved very able if not always well disciplined. 

     In 1201 the Auroran government set up a scholarship program to
allow high quality off-world students to come and study at an Auroran
university.  The government figured it would bind the worlds of the RC
closer together, if their children studied and worked together.  Also
highly educated students will be very valuable when the go back to
their homes.  500 scholarships are awarded each year, to students from
across the Coalition.  Currently a new program is up for debate in the
Senate, which would expand this program to Allied worlds in the Wilds,
such as Lancer, Xexor and Kal.

     The average citizen is quite well educated and knowledgeable about
modern technology and its uses.  There is universal computer literacy,
and every home that wants one has a computer in the home.  For those in
financial difficulty, the government provides one.  The government
feels that a computer is essential to the education, of both children
and adults.  Also citizens of adult age are expected to use the
computer to explore issues effecting the world and the politicians
seeking their vote.  

      The planet is settled with many small cities of several hundred
thousand people each.  These cities are located on each of the three
major continents.  A high speed maglev train system connects those
cities on the same continent.  The train rides in an underground tunnel
which has had the air evacuated, to lessen the drag on the train. The
train is heavily subsidized by the government, and tickets cost between
100 and 500 credits.   

      The cities are made up of small office buildings intermixed with
small apartment buildings.  Most of these buildings are around ten
stories. The capital does contain a few buildings of twenty stories. 
Almost all Aurorans live in urban apartment buildings.  They like being
connected to their neighbors.  These apartments are very spacious,
ranging from five hundred to a thousand square meters.  Office
buildings and residential buildings are intermixed, this way residents
do not have to commute long distances to their job, and can spend more
time with friends and family.  Many parks are located around these
buildings, there are many different types of parks, including flower
gardens, playing fields, jogging areas and bike trails.  Heavily
automated factories are located on the outskirts of cities.  The area
between the cities is divided into agricultural land and government
owned land.  Most of this government owned land is set up as parks and
recreational facilities.  The rest of the land is kept pure 

     Devil\'s Playground Park is one of the most popular parks on
Aurora. The park covers well over 100,000 square kilometers.   It is
the site of a massive shield volcano.  The volcano hasn\'t erupted in
over five centuries, but it is still active at a very low level.  There
are many geothermal vents, hot springs and geysers.  The only spot
where lava is currently flowing is on the western face.  The lava pours
out rather slowly, and has only covered a few acres this year.  

     McCracken Lake is another popular destination on the park. This lake
is warmed by underground geothermal activity, and is a constant 30 degrees
Celsius (85 degrees Fahrenheit).  This warmth attracts many people. 
The warmth and the nutrient rich waters supports a diverse ecosystem. 
Many tourists use rebreathers to encounter the wildlife in its natural
environment.  To maintain a peaceful setting only rowed and sailed
watercraft are allowed on the lake.  The lake covers about 2000 square kilometers.  

Changing market effects society.

     The creation of the Reformation Coalition and the Dawn League
before it, have greatly effected life on Aurora.  Interstellar trade
has allowed the creation of new devices, and an increased demand for
these devices.  It is only through increased automation, that the
supply has kept up with the demand.  Aurora hasn\'t had many resources
left over to help explore the Wilds.  This has been especially
troubling to Assemblyman MacBaen.  He tried to get the planet to fund
one of the Twelve, but most of the parliament refused.  

     Aurora is one of the few places in the Coalition which is actively
researching robotic technology.  Most of the research consists of
making sure that Virus won\'t be able to infect these devices.  The
average Auroran citizen doesn\'t run in fear at the very mention of the
robots.  They believe that Virus was a tool created by humaniti.  The
same technology which created Virus can be used to destroy or even tame it. 

     This is not to say that Aurorans are selfish people who are
ignoring the Wilds. Several companies have developed ingenious devices
to help the survivors in the Wilds.  These include simple easy to
maintain tractors and farming equipment. These are manufactured on
Aurora, but many of the replacement parts are capable of being machined
on low tech worlds.  The rest are available from Auroran trading firms.
 Also low tech worlds do not need to duplicate every stage of
technological development, they can easily leapfrog over primitive
technologies.  For instance a world without telephones, doesn\'t have to
first build telegraphs, then wire based phones, and then fiber optic
phones. It can buy off world satellites and start with cellular
communications.  Several Auroran firms are selling such equipment.  

      The Auroran economy is in a state of flux, new markets are
opening up, and with it new jobs.  At the same time as these new jobs
are being created changing technology is eliminating some types of
jobs.  Luckily for now, these two forces are about equal, and there has
been no large scale job surplus or shortage.  Many people are having to
find a new career path, but the government is trying to make the
transition as easy as possible. It hasn\'t created any job training
programs as yet, workers are in such high demand that companies are
willing to pay to train them. The government does provide a good
benefit package for those people whose jobs have been eliminated, while
they search for work.  The government recognizes that losing a job that
has been held for decades, is a traumatic experience and some people
need a little time to adjust. In the future, the economy will stop its
expansion, and this will have an impact on the job market.  The
government has created several discussion groups on the compute
     These new off world markets that are opening up are bringing in
many luxury materials such as gold, gems and hand crafts.  These hand
crafts include art, hand crafted rugs, clothing, furniture, jewelry
etc.  Also some low tech worlds export mechanical devices, which high
technology can surpass in function, but not in form.  One of the best
examples of this is clocks from Xexor.  Auroran technology can make an
atomic clock capable of keeping time to the nearest nano-second, and
which never has to be wound or even have the battery changed.  Xexor
clocks are intricate machines with tiny gears, levers and counter
weights.  They keep time well, but not perfectly.  For all their
faults, they are extremely popular on Aurora.  Xexor exports thousands
of these clocks a month.  Many of them are wonderfully decorated and
prized by their Auroran owners.

     Another factor changing the Auroran economy is the new Naval base
being established.  The RCN has decided to set up its headquarters on
the planet.  The Navy is building a large orbital facility, to maintain
the fleets of Clippers that are being built.  The Navy is also planning
on building ships in orbit.  Standard Astronics has recently begun
upgrading Aurora\'s shipyard to help handle some of the overflow
construction.  This is opening up many job opportunities, to keep up
with the demand, the Navy is bringing in some offworld help.  So far
these are Naval personal, but the possibility remains that someday the
planet might need to import workers from lower tech planets to maintain
the naval base.  This has worried some in the community. They worry
that if many outsiders are brought in to perform menial tasks, it will
create an under-class.  The creation of a two tier society, would
undermine the democratic principals on which Auroran society is based.

Wow...I disremember the title, but it was a Cordwainer Smith story. All
the prisoners were politicals of one sort or another. I seem to recall
that it was in the orignal Dangerous Visions anthology.

There\'s someone who I haven\'t read in ages and ages. Another favorite was
about the leader of a revolt by geneered animals, who was burned at the
stake

But, dragging it back to Traveller, there\'s ample canon material regarding
prison planets. I suspect they would really depend on who was running them
how they worked, so you could have a range from high tech prisons (like
that horrible one The Fortress with the guy from Highlander in it) to the
low tech (another move, with Ray Liotta bein dumped on an island with
nothing) to the usual cinematic Roadwarrior type situation, with little
law and order.

To which subject I ask the Aussie members of the list: How extensively WAS
Australia used as a penal colony? I know that to some extent the American
colonies were places for people who were persona non grata in England to
go, and lots of people escaped debtors prison by coming here as indentured
servants, but soon, when the potential wealth of the Colonies was known,
the English stopped wasting it on criminals.

I haven\'t seen the movie yet, but does this by chance have anything to do
with "The Fifth Element"?

Also, why did Plato assign those elements to those particular polyhedra?

    'body' => 'In my game last night, one of the characters attempted a grapple.  As 
a result, an opposed task was needed to see if the grappled 
character could break out as per the rules on pg. 55 of Book 1.

The rules for opposed tasks are on pg. 50 of Book 1.  I noticed 
that the wording for opposed tasks on the T4 Ref screen is 
confusing--it could be construed that each participant to the 
opposed task needs to roll his task as normal then compare results.  
This is definitely different from the description on pg. 50 of Book 
1, where it is written clearer how to handle opposed tasks.

Basically, the rule is (I\'ve written this on both pg. 50 and on my 
ref screen for easy reference):

Roll 1 D6 + target number.  The higher result wins.


As for the wording in the book, it is OK, but I think the rule can be 
written even clearer:

Opposed Tasks:  

When characters are attempting an action in direct opposition, such 
as an arm-wrestling contest, it may not always be appropriate to have 
each character make a task roll until one fails.  A faster way to 
handle such situations is to have each roll 1 D6 and add their target 
numbers to the result.  The higher total wins the opposed task.



Clarification for KBv2.0:

This rule does not have to be changed for KBv2.0.  You can use it as 
is--except use the KBv2.0 target number.  That way each character 
gets the benefit of his skill (like KBv2.0 was designed to do), and 
the throw is more evenly weighted between a character\'s skill and 
natural ablility--not dominated by a character\'s attribute.

after everyone has made their submissions.  This time I decided to share a
few thoughts about the criteria beforehand - both as an aid to discussion
and design, and as a way to work through my own thoughts and make them
clearer to myself.  I have started work on the Generica Starships entry,
but I wanted to run a few things by the rest of you first.

  The exact nature of the rules of armament for a ship purchased by
corporations rather than the Imperial government is the subject of another
of my posts - I tend to think that missile batteries controlled by MFDs,
bay, and spinal weapons are probably not allowed for civilian purchasers
(though QSDS 1.5 is perhaps deliberatly unclear on the matter).

> The following requirements must be met:
> 
> * Size:         3000 dt or less

  This will be the single hardest decision to make in a design.  Smaller
ships are cheaper, and as Famille Spofulam has already pointed out in
their press release, more smaller cheaper ships can cover a wider area in
the same amount of time.  On the other hand, certain fixtures cost the
same and take up the same volume regardless of tonnage.  Plus, a larger
ship can carry a wider variety of equipment and goodies.  Finally, a
bigger ship is more impressive to the natives and offers echoes of the
Leviathan for us CT fans.

  On balance, I would encourage folks to go for larger designs, like 1000T
or larger, at least right now.  This opinion may change once I\'ve seen the
other entries.

> * Jump:         J2 or more

  The choice here is J2 or J3, since we are doing M0 designs.  Tough
choice, in my view - I can see arguements for both (cost and cargo
capacity vs. operational flexibility).  Since the main word is
exploratory, I\'ll be awarding big points for J3 designs, since normal
economics do not apply as much.

> * Acceleration: 1G or more

  High G is not useful, but I think M2 is what one should shoot for,
rather than M1.  Margin of safety in landings on High G planets, for one
thing.  If the main ship is designed to wilderness refuel, the structure
would be profitably rated for higher than the thrusters.

> The vessel must be capable of:
> 
> * Wilderness refueling (directly or via carried craft)

  Given the vehicle size involved, I\'d go for direct fueling, with at
least one carried craft that could slowly refuel the main ship in an
emergency.  Got to have a purification plant as well.

> * Operation for 1+ year away from starport facilities
>   (repair, resupply, recreation, etc.)

  I\'d say this means at minimum an engineering shop and a sickbay, plus a
vehicle shop if small craft are carried.  Some tonnage devoted to an
entertainment area would also be nice.  I\'m not sure what "resupply" in
the above notation means - maybe extra cargo space for enough food and
other consumables?

> * Landing/retrieving crew and cargo on planetary surfaces
>   (directly or via carried craft)

  I think a dual system here would be best - landing craft to venture into
the unknown on a routine basis, but with the main craft landing if things
are deamed safe or if rescue is needed.

> * Defense against similarly sized TL 11- spacecraft

  What exactly this means I am not sure - does it refer to similarly sized
trading ships, similarly sized warships, or similarly sized system
defense boats?  For example, I\'d guess that most of the recent designs
for patrol cruisers would make short work of a 500-600T trading ship that
had any significant free cargo space.

  The key word here is probably "defense" - not that you should be able to
fight back, but that you should be able to survive long enough to get to
jump point.  Got to protect that cargo, after all.  Thus, I would tend to
favor a design with lots of sandcasters, dampers, and other defensive
strategies, but not with lots of lasers or missiles.

> Defense against relic TL 12+ weaponry should also be considered.

  Do I detect a hint of my own influence here?  This clearly refers to
meson screens - the exact level of screening is unclear to me, though note
that under 1000T desgins have an advantage here, since they get a bonus
for the same sized equipment.

  This probably means some sort of ships troops and a sick bay, as well as
low berths for those badly injured.

  This is what makes this an interesting contest - every capability you
add in reduces the cargo you can carry.  Balance is what will carry the
day here, I think - keep it inexpensive, but not too stripped down.

  Thanks for the clarification - this makes good sense to me.

  Boy do I feel primitive - it\'s all paper and pencil here, with a

  I hope these comments were interesting - further discussion is
encouraged.  I\'m sure other issues will emerge once more designs are
posted.

  By the way, could someone post the Leviathan stats?  My copy is back in
Oregon and I\'d be interested to see what that ship was like since it has
been so long since I read the adventure.  Ah, jump torpedos - what a
wonderful source of contention!

Thinking about it today, there is a rule that I\'ve taken from TNE 
that I want to experiment with.  Some of you may want to try it in 
your games as well.

In TNE, whenever you throw Spectacular Success for some of the melee 
attack routines, that action does not count against your total 
actions for the round.

Converting this to T4, I\'m going to experiment with:

Whenever you throw SS in melee combat, that action still counts as an 
action for the round (although the character can use the multiple 
action rule for more actions in the round), but it does not count 
against your character\'s End pool.

I think that this rule might work out well because the SS % is low 
enough so that it won\'t happen that often, but higher skilled 
characters will occassionally get it (if you are using the KBv2.0 SS 
rule because SS is tied to a character\'s skill level) and allow them 
to (in general) fight longer before the End penalties kick in.

This makes sense to me.  The higher skilled you are at brawling, the 
longer you can probably last in the ring.

  Well, on to my comments on the May entry - can\'t keep my big mouth shut. 
Lots to like here.  J3 M2 are spot on what I think are best, price is
right (though the hull may be a bit small), good offensive armament, a
small craft hanger, the maintenance, sickbay, and fuel purification needed
for extened ops. I especially like the hull - stressed to 10G, with 20
armor - very nice touch.  Some things SSDS just does better. 

  My criticisms are minor.  The single sandcaster and nuclear damper seem
a bit light for defensive armament, esp. given the strength of the lasers. 
The sensors also seem a bit light for an exploratory vessal, though I\'d be
open to arguement there.  No meson screen, but since it\'s a cheap ship why
bother?  I also didn\'t see any specific reference to crew security and
health other than the sickbay - may just have missed it. 

  Twenty percent of the hull is devoted to cargo, and the cost of cargo
space is a bit over 2 MCr per ton - this is a stat I\'ll be calculating for
all ships as a rough guide to economics. 

  I have two design questions.  First, why two years of fuel for the main
power plant?  What advantage does that have?

  Second, does SSDS allow for significant power savings?  I did a rough
power calculation using QSDS components, and I got about 500 MW of
consumption (not counting the fuel purification system).  Are you not
powering everything simultaneously, or are SSDS designs just more power
saving?

  Overall, a nice design as far as specs go, but it\'s a bit dull.  It
needs a little something to push it over the top and give it the Familee
Spoofulam touch.  Maybe some security robots with Fusion+ powered chain
saws roaming the corridors...yeah, that\'s the ticket!

I posted on this a few days ago.  The TNE book has some good 
guidlines on developing target numbers for animals.  You can figure 
it out in TNE form and then convert it to T4.


But, if you are using the KBv2.0 task system, I found a much easier 
way.  There are two simple steps.

(1)  Figure out what the animal would need to hit under standard CT 
rules  (8+ throw, add modifiers).

(2)  Then, invert this number so that rolling lower is better.  




Example:  Your CT animal needs 8+ to hit, but he has teeth +2, 
making it 6+ on the standard CT two dice.

You invert this so that you need to roll low instead of roll high for 
success.  Our 6+ becomes 8- for T4 (KBv2.0).

And that\'s it.  That\'s your target number.  

Why?  Because animals 
attack at contact range most of the time (although Book 1, on pg. 
152, indicates that some animal weapons can attack from very short 
range.).

Looking at the Combat Range chart on page 61 of Book 1, we see that 
an attack from contact range carries an Easy difficulty.

In KBv2.0, Easy throws are done with 2 D6--the same as CT animal 
attack throws.  So, converting animal attack target numbers to KBv2.0 
is a simple matter of inverting the target number established by the 
CT rules.

This method would not work with either the T4 or the T4-Revised task 
systems because neither of these uses 2 D6 at contact range.  Using 
the same target number with the lower amount of dice (1.5 D and 1 D 
respectively) would give the animal a bigger percentage chance to hit 
than the original CT rules intended.

This was a surprise benefit to using KBv2.0 that I discovered, and 
I\'m planning some animal encounters for my group next session.

If you are not using KBv2.0, too bad for you.  I\'d still suggest 
using the target number established in CT as a starting point.  Once 
you have that number, it would be easy (because you are only using 
two dice) to figure the % chance of success.  Then I\'d try to 
approximate that % based on the system you are using.

For example, let\'s say you are using T4-Revised, where Easy task 
rolls are done with 1 D6 (or are automatic).  Using the CT animal 
target number we generated above 6+ (8+ to hit, modified by teeth 
+2), it\'s easy to figure out that the animal has a 72.22% chance of 
making it.

Figuring 72% of 1 D6, you can either pick a target number of 4 
(66.67%) or 5 (83.33%) as the animal\'s target number--depending on 
how generous you are feeling that day.

If you are using the standard T4 task system where Easy tasks are 
thrown with 1.5 D, the calculation becomes somewhat harder due to the 
half die.

Using my trusty conversion chart that I made while designing KBv2.0, 
I see that your target number for the standard T4 task system (Easy 
tasks = 1.5 D) should be either 6- (66.67%) or 7- (83.33%).



With regard to animals with weapons that can attack from Very Short 
range (as described on page 152 of Book 1), I make a judgement call 
here.

I base all of my animal attack target numbers on contact range unless 
I feel that the animal can hit a character from more than 3 meters 
(long tentacles, shooting spines, or whatever).

If I do feel that the animal has this long range attack ability, I 
will use the CT target number as a base, figure their % chance to 
hit, and approximate that percentage on 3 D6 (The combat table tells 
us that attacks from Very Short range are an Average proposition, and 
Average tasks in KBv2.0 are done with 3 D6) just like I suggested to 
do with the T4-Standard and the T4-Revised task systems.

This is the exception, though, rather than the rule.  As I said, most 
animals attack from less than 3 meters.

Anyway, this is how I\'ve been handling animal attacks--at least until 
I see in T4-Revised how they are going to change it.

Hope this helps.

Kenneth.

The problem here is that this kind of scheme only works at the highest
levels.. Corps and above.  Below that, you need to be an integrated team,
and know the capabilities of the officers and soldiers.  If Colonel Alfa is
a bit cautious in the attack, you don\'t want his regiment to go into
pursuit, give that assignment to Colonel Bravo.  These are the sorts of
things you learn over a period of years.

Disgusted because there are no rules for determining animal target 
numbers in Book 1?  

Waiting for T4-Revised to come out and fix that problem for you?



Well, wait no further...that is if you are using KBv2.0!



Recently, I wanted to implement animal encounters into my game, so I 
set about to figure out target numbers for them.  My goal was to come 
up with a workable stop gap measure until I saw the rules in 
T4-Revised.

I was surprised at the coincidence that I found and at how easy it is 
to develop target numbers for animals if you are using KBv2.0.

Like all my rules, this is a simple fix to the problem--a game 
mechanic designed to change a minimum amount of "official" rules and 
fit seemlessly into the existing rules set.



Here\'s how it works in two simple steps:

(1)  Create your animals as per the T4/CT rules (which are basically 
the same rules set).  Note the CT target number generated.

(2)  Invert the CT target number for the animal so that lower is 
better.  For example, if the animal needs 8+ to hit in CT, the same 
animal will need 6- for T4. 



That\'s it.  That\'s all there is to it!

Why it works:

The CT system uses two dice.   A roll of 8+ is required for animals 
to hit under those rules.  This target number may be modified due to 
the animals weapons.  For example, teeth +2 give a +2 DM to hit.  In 
other words, the target number is reduced from 8+ to 6+, giving the 
animal a better chance to hit.

Page 152 of Book 1 shows us that animals attack from either contact 
or very short range.  Common sense tells us that most animals will 
attack from less than three meters because they have to be close 
enought to bite/stick/club you (or whatever), so it is clear that 
most animals attack from contact range.

Looking at the combat range table on page 61 of Book 1, we see that 
attacks from contact range require an Easy task throw.

In KBv2.0, Easy task throws are done with 2 D6.  This is exactly the 
same amount of dice required in CT for an animal to make an 
attack--except in T4, lower is better.

Therefore, all you need to do is invert your CT animal target numbers 
so that lower is better.  Use T4 Book 1, CT rules, or even Supplement 
2:  Animal Encounters to develop your animals, then simply invert 
the numbers.

That\'s all you need to do.  The percentage chance to hit is the same 
in T4 as it was in CT, so animals are just as tough or weak as they 
were in CT.

The two systems convert easily.


And that\'s pretty much it, unless your animal can attack from greater 
than 3 meters out.

Note that T4-Standard and T4-Revised do not have 2D Easy throws 
(they use 1.5 D and 1 D respectively), so in order to come up with 
target numbers for animals under those systems, you\'d have to (this 
is only one way) use the transposing percentages system I describe 
below.  Trust me, that\'s not an easy fix to the problem.








================================================================
What about animal attacks from very short range?

Very short range is up to 15 meters in T4, and, to tell you the 
truth, I can\'t see too many animals being able to attack somebody 
from that far out.

On page 152 if Book 1, it definitely indicates that some claw, hoove, 
stinger, and thrasher attacks can attack from that far out.  I use 
common sense with regard to what it says on this page.  I can see an 
animal with very long tentacles or a long tail with a stinger on the 
end of it, or even some sort of flinging spine, but it is harder for 
me to see an animal that can reach 15 meters with its claws or 
hooves.

When I\'m creating animals, and I see a possibility for the animal to 
be able to attack a target 15 meters away, I make a judgement call.

If that judgement call is that the animal can attack that far out, I 
still figure the animals target number for CT (as indicated for step 
1 above).  Then what I do is figure the animal\'s percentage chance to 
hit on two dice (for CT).  Then I transpose this percentage to a 
different target number using 3 D6 (dice code for KBv2.0 Average 
rolls--attacks from very short range require an average difficulty 
task throw) so that the animal\'s chance to hit under KBv2.0 is about 
the same as it was under CT.

Like I said above, this is the exception--most animals attack from 
contact range, and they won\'t require this math step.

Transposition example:

CT:  Animal needs 6+ to hit (8+ to hit modified by thrasher +2).

Math:  6+ on 2 D6 has a 72.22% chance of succeeding.

KBv2.0:  Figuring 72.22% of 3 D6 and converting to the closest whole 
number, the target number for T4 (KBv2.0) would be 12-, which is a 
74.07% proposition on 3 D6.

Unless you have a chart, like I do, this step is a headache.  I 
suggest using the above rules and keeping your animals in contact 
range for their attacks--at least until T4-Revised comes out, and we 
can see how they are handleing these 15 meter animal attacks.

Use common sense.  Most animals do not have the ability to attack 
from that far away anyway.

That problem is:  If mechanical assistance for implantation is
required, how did the race survive the period between the
destruction of Ancient civilization (assuming that they were

mechanical assistance problem, or self-fertilization is
successful at at least a replacement rate.

My suggestion:  Make them not need the mechanical assistance
under any circumstances; from a strictly external physical
viewpoint, make them hermaphrodites; genetically, there are no
gender-selection chromosomes as there are in most human races.
The low fertility and rare self-fertilization is OK; the
physical change I suggest doesn\'t need to affect that.

While the [revised-as-above] Sayat may be physically capable of
performing the "reproductive dance" with other humans, because
of the extreme genetic drift, such unions are not productive of
offspring.  Also, the Sayat tend not to find such liaisons
attractive (because non-Sayat don\'t "smell right").

counters (or a piece of graph paper with dots on it, or whatever) 
laid out so that your players can see the spatial relationships 
within the room.

And then one player says, "I want my character to run as fast as he 
can to get away from this guy", pointing to the big burly NPC that is 
about to clobber the PC in hand to hand combat.

The question posed to you, as a GM would see it, is how far can the 
PC run in 6 seconds?

Well, there\' an easy way to find that out.  You flip to page 52 of 
Book 1 and look at the paragraph on running.  It says there that a 
character can run up to 30 meters in one combat round.

I think that\'s a good general rule to be used for general purposes, 
but in the example above, a few feet may matter.

Everyone knows that all humans don\'t run the same.  I\'m definitely 
not a runner, and many of my friends could catch me or leave me way 
behind in an instant.

What I\'m getting to here is a little house rule I\'ve developed 
that you can use when you really want to see how far a PC can move in 
one combat round.

I\'m not advocating you use it all the time--use the general movement 
rate in the book for most applications, but you may want a more 
individualized movement rate calculation when you plotting movement 
on graph paper or half inch deck plans.

So, here\'s the rule:

A character can run (Str + Dex + End) x 1.5 meters per combat round.

He can trot or jog at 2/3 that value.  

He can walk at 1/2 that value.

He can crawl at 1/3 that value.



The Test.

Running takes into account all three of a character\'s physical 
attributes.  Strength, Dexterity, and Endurance all play a part in 
running.  That\'s why they are included in the calculation.

An average character should be able to move the average distances 
reported in Book 1 on page 52.  Therefore an average character should 
run about 30 meters in one round.

Let\'s do the calculation:
(7+7+7) x 1.5 = 31.5 meters/round

The book says characters can walk about 15 meters in one round.  

Taking the 1/2 value above for the average character, we get 15.75 
meters.
31.5 / 2 = 15.75 meters/round.



As you can see, this formula works out well when compared with the 
average values in the book.  

Implementing this system when you are in the middle of a combat, 
figuring out all the details, may add some more realism to your game.

I know it has for mine.

Trust Mark to ruthlessly disambiguate all my carefully laid ambiguities. :)
Seriously, these are great comments, and reassuring as well...this was my
first go at writing THUDDD specs, and I\'m pleased to find that I seem to
have neither over- nor under-constrained the design.  Now, onward to
specific comments...

This is a deliberate and useful ambiguity, perhaps so in QSDS, and
definitely in this THUDDD.  What armamemts are permitted to what
categories of owners under what circumstances is an essential \'flavor\'
element in a campaign, and one which can easily be modified by each GM
without doing violence to the remainder of the standard background.  As
such, I left this door more or less open. 

As a suggestion (non-binding, unofficial, use at your own risk), it might
well be the case that, for a vessel with this high-risk mission (in the
Imperial interest and possibly with Imperial backing), the Imperium might
be inclined to license \'military\' armaments/equipment to a greater degree
than would be enjoyed by an intra-Imperial freighter.  Thus, I would
suggest that minor military hardware not be disallowed, but perhaps
slightly discouraged.  The meanings of \'minor\' and \'slightly\', and
evaluation of the merits of this argument as a whole, are left to the
esteemed judges.

"Resupply" is another deliberate ambiguity.  Some GMs will presume that
the vessel\'s crew will likely be able to forage for food at almost every
stop en route; others may make human-edible foodstuffs relatively rare.
Similar questions apply to other consummables (other than very easily
found commodities like water and atmospheric gasses).  One interesting
category of \'consummables\' is spare parts.  I\'m not sure how much detail
people want to (or can) go into here, but I wanted the issue at least in
designers\' minds.

Again, deliberate ambiguity here, but your thinking more or less parallels
mine in terms of what this might mean.  Others may intepret this
differently.

I\'m very much looking forward to seeing what people come up with.  I (er,
Ce Acatl Corporation) will be doing a design as well, which I\'ll post to
the list after the entry deadline, just for kicks.

I think there are still a few open issues.  One question I have is whether
multiple sandcasters can be grouped into a battery run from an MFD, rather
than requiring one gunner per caster.

Thanks.  Any strong objections on this?

By the way, I\'m putting rules clarifications like this onto the main
THUDDD page as they come up, so designers might want to take a look there
now and then to see if anything new has been added.

Long before VisiCalc came along, a \'spreadsheet\' was a big flat ruled
sheet of paper, used by accountants wielding pencils.  So, in other words,
don\'t feel left out. :)

Well, this might be taken as strong evidence that they weren\'t seeded by
the Ancients, but are spinoffs of early Solomani colonists.  I\'m trying to
not specify this, but leave it open for people to pick as (and if) they
like.

As far as the \'mechanical assistance\' goes, I\'m not talking about anything
fancy here, no test-tube baby stuff -- just a variation on the infamous
\'turkey baster\' approach.  Low-tech in the extreme; like maybe TL-2 stuff?
If the Vilani could surive on a planet where nothing was edible without
chemical processing, a little thing like this seems like child\'s play.
After all, if you screw up as a Sayat, you just don\'t have a kid that time
around; if you\'re Vilani and screw up, you starve, get sick, or are
poisoned.

The idea was to keep gross anatomical changes to the Sayat minimal -- no
ovipositors.  I wanted them to be clearly genetically engineered but not
necessarily *efficiently* engineered.  Hence stuff like the non-compact
frame in a cold environment, and the inability of their eyes to deal with
strong (local!) daylight.  I\'d like their origins to be a bit of a
*mystery* instead of one more off-the-shelf "300,000 year old ant-farm that
Grandfather left behind" / "Solomani bio-fascist {master race, slave race,
toy race} gone their own way."  Hell, send your PCs out to investigate.
Have some Hiver meddle with \'em for reasons unknown.  Have the SolSec take
an unseemly interest in their conclusions.  Have them wake up some mutant
Droyne from hibernation.  Have the Sayat start shooting at everone.  It\'ll
be fun.

In RPG terms, besides the Traveller background, my guiding vision has been
"Macho Women With Guns" meets "Call of Cthulhu," I suppose.  In Alpha
Complex.

(Do I qualify for a position in the Grand Heresiarchy?)

Not sure I follow you here -- *do* you mean gender here, or sex?  Yeah,
they\'re all 46-XX in terms of their genetic sex; like I say, I\'d rather
keep anatomical changes to a minimum to give that jerry-rigged impression.

How delicately put <G>.  Yeah, that\'s what I had in mind -- something along
the lines that the modifications made to the protein receptors on the Sayat
ova, in order to permit ovum-ovum fertilization, is far enough removed from
other human molecular biology that there\'s no chance of fertilization with
sperm or non-Sayat ova.  The little critters just can\'t connect up.  It\'s a
little harder for Sayat ova to manage, too; but sometimes there\'s a glitch
and two from the same person will spontaneously co-fertilize (if that\'s a
word).  Any biologists care to clean up my doubletalk for me, please?

Heh -- and equally or more likely, the Sayat might smell funny/bad to other
humans.

I\'ve always tended (when it mattered) to assume that the 0 degree line
would run through the starport or the colony. The other likely line would
be through some terrian feature readily identifable from orbit by a scout
ship.

Ken, I\'m doing it just a little differently.

Full out, Sprint is (Strength+Dexterity)*2

The average character can then run 28m/6sec, or 100m in 21.4
seconds. That\'s about average, I\'d say.

A character with outstanding attributes, let\'s say 12 and 12, can run
48m/6sec, or 100m in 12.5 seconds.  That\'s close to world class, and a
15+15 would be...100m in 10 seconds.

How LONG a character can sprint at full speed is his Endurance!

Our average character can run 7 rounds, or 42 seconds, at full speed before
exhastion.  That\'s just less than 200m...and that\'s about right for the
average person.

Our *hunk* at 12, 12, 12, can run 72 seconds at 8 meters per second, or 576
meters!  This is Michael Johnson class.

Running is (Strength+Dexterity)

Mr Average (7,7) can run the 1500m in 10.7 minutes.

Ms Outstanding (12,12) can run the 1500m in 6.25 minutes.  Not world class,
but pretty darn good.

How Long they can run is Endurance*50, but this doesn\'t really scale all
that well now that I look at it. Maybe a power...

Jogging is 3/4 STR+DEX.

Walking is 1/2 STR+DEX.

If you want to push an outstanding character into Olympic class they would
have to develop specific *skills* to add to their raw speed. There *are*
techniques to sprinting, middle distance, and endurance running.

Anyway, I figure this out and put them on the Character Sheet. 

Oh yeah, remember to reduce END for the effort put out sprinting and
running.

As you suggest, latitude is easy to figure out.  A Solomani-derived
cartography scheme would define \'North\' as the pole over which, when
looking back down at the planet, the planet appears to rotate
counterclockwise.

Longitude is much more arbitrary.  Any fixed point on the surface may be
defined as lying on the zero of longitude.  Here are some suggestions on
how the zero-longitude line might be chosen: 

* For tidally locked worlds, the zero will typically be through the
  subprimary point (the mean point, if there\'s significant libation).
  This is the convention used for locked moons in our own solar system.

* For worlds surveyed long before habitation, the zero might run through
  some prominent landmark, like the tallest mountain\'s peak.

* For worlds first mapped during colonization, the zero might run through
  the first colony\'s starport or a beacon near it.

* For worlds with significant amounts of surface water, the zero might be
  chosen so as to be 180 degrees away from a (nearly) pole-to-pole stretch
  of open ocean, thereby reducing dateline hassles.  (Incredibly, Earth
  lucked into this arrangement!)

As for finding the zero longitude line, you\'d use either an ephemeris /
planetary database program coupled with your ship\'s sensors in the
wilderness, or navigational beacons and datafeeds in civilization.

Hope this helps!

Yes, I played with this before I decided to go with the three sixes.  

You\'ve basically got two problems with tieing SF to skill level.  
First, the higher skill level, the lower chance you want SF to be.

This is easy to do (like the way we did it) with SS, but with SF, you 
are talking about an inverse relation ship--higher skill level, lower 
target number.

This is hard to do in a simple, easy game machanic that doesn\'t bog 
down the game.

The second problem you have is that, even if you come up with an 
inverse number, your probabilities are going to get smaller the more 
dice you throw.

For instance, you just can\'t use some target number--say the number 
7, as your SF target number because the chance of rolling a 7 or less 
actually goes down the more dice you throw.

This is not the relationship you want with SF.  The chance for SF 
occurring should go up the harder a task gets--not the other way 
around.

It wouldn\'t make sense to have a 10% chance of rolling SF on an Easy 
task and have a 2% chance of roll it on an Impossible task.  The 
Impossible task should definitely carry a bigger chance of SF.

This is why I decided to use the 3 sixes approach--and not the target 
number 18.  18 can be rolled in many ways--depending on how many 
dice are thrown.  By using the 3 sixes option, this cuts down on the 
amount of times it can be rolled, and it has the added benefit of 
sending the SF % up the harder the task is.

Besides, this is the "official" rule, and it works with KBv2.0.  
For all of these reasons, this is why I decided to use it in KBv2.0 
as well.

Kenneth.

PS  Bill, did you check out the animal target number post for use 
with KBv2.0?  What a find!

Very good system, Eris!  I like your ideas too.

I can see how you figure them out first and put that info on the 
character sheet.  

Your way of doing it is definitely for the the detail oriented.  I 
think my way is more for those who don\'t usually use that type of 
detail, but can figure it out real quick in the middle of a combat 
round, if need be.

Eris is right I think in that running speed is unaffected by END. END tells
you how long time you can run. The reason I don\'t include STR in running
speed is that I\'ve never seen really high STR guys running much faster than
my mother:) The reason for that is muscle friction and mass (it might
actually have to do with the square cube law again). Also after a certain
STR your ability in lifting multiples of your own weight goes down when
adding more muscles, that\'s also why no climbers are very muscled. Maybe
you should cap the advantages of STR to 10 or so is no speed bonus (or even
speed penalties) above STR 10).

QSDS hull are built with 1G contra gravity lifters for just these reasons. 
Keep in mind that a 1G rating for contra grav isn\'t an absolute rating but a
relative rating (i.e., a 1G contra grav on a world with a gravity 1.5Gs
actually produces 1.5Gs of thrust).  However, SSDS ships install contra grav
as a separate system.  1G of contra grav used with 1G thrusters allows a ship
to make planetfall and not worry about what the strength of the local gravity
field is, and increases the safety margin for gas giant refueling
considerably.

    'body' => '  Well, nice to see that I hit the nail on the head as far as ambiguity
goes - I\'ll bet this reflects the fact that the committee in the Imperial
bureau responsible for writing the description didn\'t really know what the
hell they wanted, so they wrote a description that would get them all
sorts of entries. 

  As I was reading the section on weaponry again, it struck me that we
have at least one example of Imperial policy in this matter (though from
CT and the late Third Imperium).  You may recall that one of the Azhanti
High Lightning-class was bought in a jiggered deal by a private company
(Tukera?  I hate having all my Traveller stuff in Oregon!) where they took
delivery outside the borders of the Imperium.  The ship could never
re-enter the Imperium, since it still had all its weaponry, including that
big honking spinal mount.  Since the ship was used for trading with the
Vargr, this was no bad thing - kept the natives respectful, so to speak.

  The question then becomes when this policy came into being.  I\'d argue
it predates the Third Imperium - probably goes back to the First, for that
matter.  Governments like to have a monopoly on extreme methods of
violence, especially when it comes to things that threaten trade.  For the
early Third Imperium, this is probably even more of an issue, due to the
desire to control piracy.

  Thus, I\'d guess that owning military-grade weaponry in the Imperium
would be limited to world governments and the Imperial Navy, with the Navy
keeping a damn close eye on world governments to make sure they are not
fronts for pirates.  Thus, system defense boats will get the latest tech -
but vessals capable of jump would be tightly restricted.

  Now, I\'m sure the average Megacorp could figure ways around this in a
heartbeat.  Operating entirely outside the boundaries of the Imperium is
one method - another might be to get a ship designated as a naval
"reserve" ship that could be called up in time of war.

  Here is a tentative list of military-grade equipment, divided into three
catagories:  Unrestricted (all vessels can legaly mount these), restricted
(special permits or regulations apply), and forbidden (only Imperial
military ships or SDBs can use them).  I\'d be interested in comments as to
how well each item fits in the catagory assigned.

UNRESTRICTED
  Military Control Systems (just radiation hardened versions of civilian
			    technology)
  Communications Systems 
  Civilian Laser Batteries (essentially +0 rated systems)
  Sandcasters
  Meson Screens
  Nuclear Dampers

RESTRICTED
  Military Sensor Systems (this is open to interpretation, but the Basic
			   and Improved packages from QSDS are described
			   as not including LADAR for range-finding and 
			   target designation - I could see that
			   technology being restricted)
  Military Laser Turrets and Barbettes*
  Missile Turrets and Barbettes without MFDs*

  * According to QSDS, most (NOT all) planets allow non-military
shipowners to install these systems

FORBIDDEN
  Missile Batteries (missile systems with MFDs)
  Bay Weapons
  Spinal Weapons


  Most of the above seems reasonable, aside from the fact that MFDs are
allowed for laser instalations but not for missiles.  This may be a law
left over from TL-10 times, when lasers were not dangerous at long range.
For example, a TL-10 laser bay in the QSDS system is 50T, needs 125 MW,
costs 104MCr, and is only rated at (+3)1/2-0-0-0.  At TL-12, you can get
that same rating with a single turret that is 5.3T, uses 29.8MW, and costs
only 27MCr (gravitic focussing is great).  If I were the Imperium, I\'d
forbid MFDs for lasers as well - QSDS has laser batteries that fit in a
50T space that do (+4)1/9-7-5-3, better than a 100T TL-11 PA-Gun!

	Don\'t sweat it...  I planned it for player use in this upcoming
game I\'m working on.  Thus the absence of spinal mounts and 6G T-Plate 3G
Heplar M-drives, and the Captain\'s \'Fresher not being mounted right up in
the nose cone with panoramic windows :).

	A corollary to GMing rule #1 ("Thou shalt not let the players have
characters wierder or more evil than the bad guys") ought to be "Thou shalt
not let the players have bigger spinal mounts than the bad guys"...  I
would never have let my players have a Bludgeon to themselves; the
possibilities are just too nightmarish :).

	If you recall, I did do some normalish designs for the Far Trader;
it hurts but I can keep myself under control sometimes :).

	The ship\'s locker is full of Famille Spofulam Armaments latest
toys?  20mm derringers and so forth?  Giant hyrdaulic pistons under floor
panels that slam them into the ceiling with alarming force?  Smart
doorknobs that discharge 50 Mw for 5 seconds if their sensors don\'t
recognize your handprint?  Cleaning robots designed to sneak into
hijackers\' quarters late at night after they\'re asleep and pour drano into
their ears and nostrils?  Coffeemaker that\'ll only make instant for
anybody\'s who\'s not a cremember?  Entertainment system that\'ll only play
the same episode of "We _all_ love Luucii" (at _FULL_ volume unless you
enter in a PIN?

	The possibilities are endless :).

	Good benchmark.  Something I\'m planning on using when rating the
designs is PC group affordability; can a small group of traders band
together and buy one?  From a game perspective, it makes more sense to have
something your PC\'s could own; something they don\'t cuts down on their
freedom and so forth...

	Misjump into ye olde interstellar boondockes.  Note the 10 LB\'s
(although that might not be enough if you\'re carrying a full load of
gunners (which would be unlikely)).  If you misjump, the safety card in the
back pocket of every seat tells the passengers to don lifejackets and
proceed to jump into the fuel purification plant, while the crew start
programming the \'puter to aim the ship at the nearest GG and floor it up to
frac-cee speeds (& back down again) while they nap.

	Yes.  Apparently QSDS folds a lot of stuff into the hull\'s power
requirements and adds some more just for good luck.  SSDS designs seem to
consistently come out requiring less power.

OK, before we hit the per capita income table, check the implications 
for trade. On the supply side, obsolete starships get cheaper. The 
Long John class of TL11 transports will sell for 85% of it\'s cost 
in Imperial Credits, thus reducing it\'s monthly payments by about 15%. 
On the demand side, the same thing built on a low-tech 
world will cost less in Imperial Credits - possibly enough to pay 1000 
Imperial Credits per parsec per ton in shipping. For example, if you 
are recruiting a Home Guard on a TL10, Starport C world, you might buy 
a heap of TL9 military equipment from a nearby starport C, TL9 world, 
because you can buy more laser rifles etc with the same amount of 
tax revenue (one C-A credit buys 1.32 C-9 credits).

Hmmm, your average citizen on Sylea makes KCr16 per year ... 
not too many of them will sign up for 5 terms in the Navy and 
a pension of one-quarter of that. OTOH someone from Nowheresville
in the boonies is going to go "4000 credits a year ? I\'d like
to see that". At a guess, many of the career Imperial Navy officers 
aregoing to be independantly wealthy landed types, and most of the
long-term NCO types are going to be from dirtball worlds out in
the provinces. Add a bunch of people signing up for a term to see
the galaxy and do their patriotic duty, and you have the IN.

Also, check the steep rise in per capita income from TL5 to TL8 ...
about x40 income. This is one hell of an incentive for megacorporations
to build up low tech, previuosly isolated worlds on favourable terms
for the world - ten percent of a TL8 world\'s revenue is more than 
100% of the revenue from a TL5 world.

It\'s pretty clear that most commodities are not going to be traded 
between the stars, and most people are not going to travel either.

However, luxury goods, some capital goods, some non-locally produced
but essential goods and military goods are going to be traded,
becasue of their high value per ton. If it costs a megacredit per ton
at source and double that at market, you could carry it 200 parsecs and
still make a profit. Likewise, if you make a megacredit a year from your
estates, then Cr80 000 to travel 8 parsecs for a hunting trip isnt 
going to faze you (the 6 weeks or so stuck in space may, however).

Next installment will try to actually quantify the trade from and to a
world, given a UPP and some other data ...

Oberlindes lines was the sneaky company that bought the Azhanti. Sounded a

I would really like someone to put some ships through some combat sequences
to see if these defences actually work... The basic ship combat system in the 
T4 rulebook is pretty deadly - a few hits and *poof* you\'ve probably lost
a drive, power plant or you\'ve plain old exploded. That\'s bad. If your
opponent has more maneuver than you, he\'ll hit eventually and then you\'re
SOL. 

Now, I\'m not saying that "the best defence is a good offence" 100% of the
time, but I think we\'ve got to do a dry run to see how things work out here...

???

I still think that if you don\'t have a meson gun, you don\'t need a meson
screen. I mean, this is like saying \'traders operating near the former
USSR should be equipped with anti-surface missile missles to ensure saftey
from former Soviet warships". I mean, really - a ship has to be really
stinking huge before it can mount a meson gun that does any appreciable amount
of damage. If you\'re protected from it - so what? The ship will be able to
outgun you with it\'s dozen of laser bays, laser batteries and PA bays.
And if it\'s deep meson sites you\'re worried about, I have two points:

a) deep meson sites can draw more power in one shot than the Sylean
navy will use in a year. OK, maybe not that much, but a lot. Your
crappy little meson screen will do little to stop it.

b) Why in the universe are you pissing off a planet so much that they\'re
firing their deep meson guns at you???? Stupid!

As always, if you want good defence, I say mount more armor. It will
absorb hits from any kind of weapon, laser, PA or meson and it requires
no power, gunners or MFDs. Sandcasters, yes, useful. Nuclear dampers, 
yes, useful, perhaps even necessary to transport certain types of 
nasty radioactive cargos which can be quite lucrative. But meson
screen? I\'d mount advanced EMM before I\'d mount a meson screen and
it\'s kinda silly to have a trader with super-advanced EMM (for the
most part).

I would assume that it\'s the same as for lasers, which is that once the
MFD is present, individual gunners are not required, although if your
MFD is taken out, you now have no one to handle the turrets... for a ship
trading on the frontier, having extra gunners would also mean having extra
hands to do cargo loading/unloading groundside, so I\'d say to have a few
extra gunners figured into your crew counts... (besides, it means there\'s
extra "red shirts" to die during adventures. :) )

I think James Dempsey has a partial SSDS eratta to his web page, but
it needs some extra items (like the gunnery crew stuff). It would be
_great_ to have all the SSDS corrections in one place.

Will armour really protect against meson gun hits? Is this T4 canon or am I

There is mainly two ways around this.
One as Rupert suggests it, and the other is more related to predrawn
maps, using the IS form 21. The system I use with this map is as
following: N-yy/xx. N may also be S. That indicates if the certain
location is north or south of the equator. yy indicated in wich hex
row from 1 through 11. And xx indicates how far east you count in
hexes.

Of course this only helps to indentify the cities on the map without
having to write on the map itself. So if this isn\'t what you look for
Use Rupert\'s suggestion.

        What a coincidence. That was my second personal theory about the
black curtain (the first being the return of Yaskoydray, to capture the
definitive slave: Virus).
        After all, Lucan\'s scientists "created" Virus, so they could have
some means of fighting it. And Virus was the result of Imperial Research
Station Omicron, but there could be more than that.... e.g., the scientists
of other station, who have been researching pocket universes, were able to
create a physical barrier protecting Lucan\'s safe area and beyond, let\'s say
the Core sector. The whole sector is now (TNE) a pocket universe where Lucan
is still fighting against the remnants of Virus. This universe is connected
through strange channels to the place in normal universe where Core sector
used to be, but this place, after the "incident", is a bit weird... normal
physical laws do not work anymore. Some Vampire fleets manage to go out from
time to time, capture more ships, and try to go back.

The only problem with this is the relative stability of borders - in 1100,
the Imperium\'s borders are pretty much fixed, with the exception of
a few systems in the Marches. In 0, weeellll... the Imperium is kinda
looking to expand its borders pretty aggressively. Having a ship for
the purpose of "trading outside of Imperial borders" is going to be
a losing proposition around Year 0 - you have less and less territory every
year.

Also, in 1100, the Imperium knew who had the ship and didn\'t really fear
it being used, even against the Imperium itself. (If Oberindes decided
to start doing commerce raiding with their big ship, the Imperium could
and would make Oberindes\' business life difficult). On the other hand,
anybody who goes outside of Sylean/Imperial space in Year 0 is probably
going to sell all their wizz-bang weaponry to one of the new Imperium\'s
enemies, make a tidy bundle and get the heck out of there. Not the
sort of situation the new Imperium wants - selling arms indirectly to
its own enemies.

I think the Imperium would make the weapons itself and just plain
old not sell them. Or at least, they\'re choosy about who they sell
to, kind of like the US and its military technology today. (Imagine
letting me buy a F15 just \'cause I said I\'d keep it in Canada).

Nuclear dampers have legitimate civilian uses - handling of
radioactive cargo, halping prevent radiation damage to people, etc.

Meson screens, on the other hand, have one purpose and one purpose
only - defence against meson guns. Meson guns are very big, very 
nasty top-of-the-line military weapons. No civilian should ever be
in a place where they need to defend themselves against this kind
of weapon. It\'s like selling cars with 3 inch hardened steel armor.
Even if it was legal (selling an armoured car isn\'t illegal, I know)
I doubt that it would really be that economical - why waste 20+MCr
on something that will probably never be used.

(Maybe it\'s a cultural thing - I understand that you can buy
armour-piercing bullets in the US, the only purpose of which 
is to get through armour that is only worn by military and 
police people. You can\'t buy this in Canada and I agree that
it\'s a generally good idea.)

Also, I doubt that the Syleans would want their potential enemies
having all their ships meson screened with brand new Sylean units...
kinda makes meson guns even more useless if it\'s trivially easy
to defend yourself against them.

I think that kind of laser battery consists of something like 10 or 12
individual weapons... getting hit by that many lasers at once would
sure put you in a world of hurt!

The source of my problem with meson screens is a more fundamental one - 
I like spinal mounts. I think they should rule the battlefield. They
should be orders of magnitude more powerful than any other single
weapon that you can stick in a ship. Having even the simplest free traders
even somewhat defended against the meson gun, the hugest, most powerful
direct-fire-explosive weapon in the history of humaniti kinda ruins it.

The problem with them in T4 is one of scale - small PAs and Meson guns
don\'t do much damage. As they get bigger, however, their damage should
go up by some exponential factor, making those big ships that we can\'t
build (yet) really, really deadly.

I agree that that\'s a problem, but is it cost-effective to keep entire Imperial 
divisions and corps at full strength all the time?  Even if you lose some tactical 
ability, it probably makes sense to leave the worlds in charge of raising troops and 
just provide the infrastructure.  

I think that the TML had a discussion about this last year, but I don\'t remember the 
results.

How about a line from pole to pole bisecting the light side when the planet
is at perigee or apogee in it\'s orbit? Would have to precisely time the
orbit to get the proper place.

Or a line from pole to pole, exactly bisecting the largest land mass on the
planet. For Earth, I think that would be somewhere in the Finland Russia,
Turkey,Syria, Israel, Jordan, Egypt, Ethopia, etc.

Or a line from pole to pole, exactly bisecting the largest water body on the
planet. 

The first would take some precise calculations, the second would be some
what simplier by observation.

One of my players used a RAM grenade in the alien complex in Shadows to
take out some of the Alien critters.

And the rest of the party.

And he had plenty of time to consider the error of his ways as I ruled that
he brought the roof down and trapped himself in. Well, actually, he had 8
hours before his suit failed! ;)

Sort of a high tech version of Leonard\'s story....

Yes. Interesting little known fact. The UK\'s nuclear reprocessing facility
at Sellafield has recently built a gas fired CHP plant to fill in the gap
in steam generation between any new nuclear stations (the existing Magnox
reactors are nearly 50!) being built. The original plans were to use local
coal for the plant, but then they realised that the radiation levels
exceeded the site limits! ;-)

Oh yes - apparently one of the first indications that Chernobyl had
happened was the site airborne sensors indicating radiation, which cause a
few worried people until they realised that it was carried in the rain that
was falling, nothing to do with the site. There are still sheep farmers in
the area who can\'t sell their flocks and are being compensated.

Apologies for the non-Traveller rambling.

Yeah, I do almost everything on the fly *except* character stats. ;->

Extending the "how far can a PC run?" theme a little, how are people using
the Atletics skill?

On a slightly different subject, I don\'t actually use Dexterity+Strength
for running speed. I\'ve always broken Dexterity into two parts Manual
Dexterity (for fine motor skills..like repairing components or picking
locks) and Agility (for gross motor skills..like dance or running). I
actually use Agility+Strength.

Is this something that is generally agreed to?  It looks like you are
multiplying the CG lift times the local gravity level: 1G*1.5g=1.5G\'s of
thrust.

This means a 6G lifter in a 3g gravity could produce, 6*3=18G\'s of lift? 
That should boost you out of that gravity well like a "bat out of
Hades"...and leave a dirty spot on your pilot\'s couch if you aren\'t

I\'ll be looking forward to your next installment.  It sounds like just the

Didn\'t Rob Prior start a series of posts on a system for generating trade

I can see that.

What I\'m doing is, after the player rolls all the dice and determines
success or failure, I pick up any sixes and reroll them.  Every six I get
on the second roll is an increasing degree of failure. Example:

John rolls:  1 6 2 6 4, and being a *pro* succeeds at his task.

I re-roll the two sixes:  4 6, and although John succeeded, it was only a
partial success.

John rolls again:  6 4 5 6 6, and even a pro doesn\'t succeed on 27 too
often..he fails.

I re-roll the 3 sixes:  3 3 6, and his failure is even worse..something bad
happens.  If I\'d rolled two or three sixes it would have been awful! ;->

It\'s pretty subjective, but it\'s worked pretty well.  Of course, I\'ve only
used this in my PBEM\'s so far and I roll all the dice there anyway. ;->  I
*do* like having degrees of success and failure.

That has to have been a mis-statement!  The mythical meson cannon skips the
armor and hits the meat.  Maybe having more internal structure to absorb
the meson hits is what he meant.

You know the *only* thing about meson cannon that I like is the deep meson
site.  I absolutely detest them as ship weapons..from a game play/design
point of view. 

Eris

ps.
I think I\'ll invent the singularity cannon!  It fires a pair of transverse
standing gravity waves forming a singularity at their intersection.  The
standing waves travel at the speed of gravity (is that c, or is that
something else? <g>), until they decay at range X.  Yep, that\'s my new
weapon, the singularity cannon..think it\'ll ever be canon? ;-b

Ah, yes!  I know what you mean.  You\'re talking about the "muscle bound"
weight-room jockeys.  I don\'t really picture hight STR that way though.  A
competition class sprinter is *strong*, as strong in their way as a
weightlifter.  If we\'re going to model this accurately we\'d have to have
attributes for the "fast-fire" muscle strength of the sprinter and
"slow-fire" muscle strength of the lifter.

That\'s true too.

For simplicity, you are probably right.  We could say that STR is the
combination of all kinds of strength and you get speed and lifting benefits
up to a certain level, but after that you begin to lose speed while lifting
continues on up.  This might be pretty accurate too, because sprinters have
to be careful not to over do strength training to keep from getting muscle
bound.

I think what he meant is that each G of contra grav counters 1G of world
gravity, were (obviously) 1G varies from world to world. So a 1G contra
grav would work just as effectively, and produce relatively the same amount
of lift on Saturn as it would on Earth. I don\'t think I really agree with
that idea, but then I don\'t know what the generally agreed to definition is.

I\'ve been trying to incorporate CT/MT/TNE armor types into the T4 
game mechanics.  I need Armor Values for things like Flak Jackets, 
Cloth Armor, and Combat Armor.

My first thought was to redesign each piece of armor using FFS, but 
since that is not out yet for T4, I\'m going to have to wait.

In the mean time, I\'ve been comparing MT AV\'s to T4 AV\'s, and these 
look the closest to what T4 is using.  The TNE AV\'s are much too 
small.

For example, in MT, Mesh Armor is AV 2.  Coincidentally, in T4, Mesh 
Armor is also AV 2.

But, I run into some problems with other armor types.  The CSC states 
that Battle Dress-14 would be AV 10.  In the MT Player\'s Manual, 
Battle Dress-14 is AV 18!  That\'s a huge difference--almost twice.

Making other comparisons between flex, cloth, and combat armor, it 
seems that MT AV\'s are pretty close to T4 AV\'s.

The question is:

What is your opinion on using MT AV\'s with the T4 system?

I\'ve got to find a way to incorporate these armor types into T4.  As 
it is, there is not that much armor to choose from for T4.  
Basically, you\'ve got Battle Dress and Flex.  

What do you think?

list.

During our game on Sunday, my players were in a space station 
outsystem from the main planet.  They got the maser communicator 
working, and they tried to contact the starport on the main world.

The question came up of how much of a time lag is there for 
communications.

How I handled this was to figure the linear distance between the 
station and the planet (I had already made a map of the system prior 
to the session, and it was easy to calculate the distance between the 
station and the planet).  Then, we just calculated time based on the 
communication traveling at the speed of light.  It turned out that 
the time lag was around 11 minutes.

How do you guys handle long distance communications like this?

I figured maser communications would travel at the speed of light, 
but what about Radio communications?  How fast do radio waves 
travel in space?

I see all types of applications for this.  For instance, when a 
starship first enters a system and locks on to the homing 
transmission from the starport.  How much of a time lag is there.  
This could also be applied in starship combat if the distances are 
long enough.

So, the question of this post is:  How do you handle long distance 
communications and time lags in your games?

Thanks,

Kenneth.

Right?

So, here goes question number three for the night...

I\'ve been educating my players (and myself) on the workings of their 
starship.  I\'m using the Starship Operator\'s Manual as a guide.

We were discussing the M-Drive (how it works, and such) before our 
game last Sunday, and the question came up...

If you\'ve got a ship with an M-Drive that produces 1 G acceleration, 
how does that ship lift off from a planet with a gravitational field 
rated at 2 Gs?

I spotted the short paragraph in the SOM about overdriving the 
M-Drive.  I take it that their explanation is that the M-Drive of a 
ship can be overdriven by up to 400% for a very short time.  I guess 
that means that our ship, which produces 1 G acceleration, really 
produces 4 Gs of acceleration when it is taking off or landing 
planetside.

Is this the explanation you use in your games, or am I missing 
something?

Kenneth.

True, and calculating the position would be a simple task for the 
astrogation program, probably only requiring a few seconds of sensor 
data on the system\'s motion pattern.  Damn good idea.

I know this is an old post, but I kept it around because it mentions
something that has always bugged me. Unfortunately, the rules are quite
clear on this point. Page 97 of T4 says "Passage is always sold on the
basis of transport to the announced destination, rather than on jump
distance.... A Jump 3 starship charges the same passage price as a Jump 1
starship."

This is a loophole big enough to slip a planet through. The opportunities
for abuse, like buying a ticket for a 200-jump journey and selling the
remaining fare after 1 jump, living cheaper on starships than at fleabag
hostels, starships jumping to empty space and allowing passengers to buy
passage to the next planet or get off here, should be so obvious I will
mention only these few examples. Since the cost in equipment, crew, fuel,
and technology of higher jump numbers will not be compensated by higher
revenues, it would be financially insane for any commercial vessel to have
greater than Jump-1 at any tech level. The only way for ships to avoid this
trap is to only travel back and forth between two planets a single jump
from each other. Not only is this situation absurd, but it is contrary to
the Traveller canon of free traders plying far reaches of space.

I feel the proposal to charge passage for each parsec to the destination is
the simplest fix to the situation, but that it makes interstellar travel
even more expensive that it already is in Traveller. Is there anyone with
an accounting background who would undertake the effort to calculate
reasonable passage prices based on the operating expenses for starships?

direct fire range fix. It also seems painfully obvious (to me, anyway) that
one is needed, so I\'ve decided to work at one. If I get anywhere I\'ll post
my results here (assuming that anyone\'s interested, that is).

Looking at approaches I\'ve identified two main avenues:

1/ Go back to real-world research and work from there. This has the
advantage of automatically passing reality checks, but this may end up with
something that doesn\'t fit well with \'cannon reality\'. Another disadvantage
(for me) is that I probobly can\'t get hold of much in the way of source
material.

2/ Fit the MD design sequence into the existing FF&S sequneces in such a
way that MDs have performance characteristics in a range that fits TNE
cannon. This of course means that there\'s a fair chance that MDs, like
gravitic focusing in lasers could well involve large amounts of handwaving.
This is especially true as it\'s years since I did any physics, and I always
was hopeless at anything involving electromagnetics.

Of these approchese I\'m going to try the later, as this way I can work
backwards from a set of parameters describing a MDs desired performance in
the rules. Some characteristics I\'m looking at:

1/ At TL9 MDs should have less military usefulness than ETC powered CPRs
(so that ETC guns still have some value).

2/ At TL10+ they should be better than ETCs, though they will probably
still be bigger when the power supply is considered.

3/ Once High Energy weapons come into service they\'ll be relegated to
indirect fire support. In this role ETC guns may be better, in which case
the MDs will become obselete.

4/ While tank mounted MDs will be primarily FE weapons HEAP rounds should
have some use, so MD calibres should be in the same range as CPR guns
(besides it sounds dumb having MBT main guns with the same calibre as an
APC\'s autocannon).

5/ The power requirements should be low enough that they are practical for
vehicle mounts at TL9+

For this to happen MD penetration will have to take a nose-dive, other-wise
nobody\'ll ever go with plasma or fusion guns. To make sense in the indirect
role they\'ll at least need to be capable of firing base bleed and rocket
assisted rounds.

Obviously most of these requirements can be met by lowering the MVs and MEs
of Mass Drivers, but other parts of the sequence will have to be changed as
well.

I\'d also like to get ammo weights more in line with the rest of FF&S. In a
similar vein I intend to at least try to mesh the lower end with the gauss
rifle sequence. BTW, I seem to recall someone saying that the Gauss
sequence has flaws, if so what are they?

Comments and discussion is more than welcome.

Light speed.  Radio, maser, laser, radar, infrared all light speed.  I try
to remember that there are approximately 500 light seconds in an AU, so
when distances are measured in AU I just multiply by 500. If the distance
is in millions of kilometers I divide by 300,000. If the distance is in
light seconds, I just use light seconds. ;-> It would be nice if all
distances in-system were measured in light seconds.

Until the SOM further defined M-Drives and the capability of overdriving 
them, I had a JATO strap on (sold at all the better starports) for ships 
needing that extra boost.  At cr100 per 100 tons of ship, it was economical 
enough for most traders and but still allowed me to explain how things were 
\'supposed\' to work with a minimum of handwaving.  Also, if a ship was less 
than 50% loaded (including fuel), I would permit liftoff from any standard 
world.  Some of the PCs ended up being quite good at orbital cargo 
transfer!

Currently, I allow for overdriving the M-drives.  There are 
some...interesting, details that must be allowed for.  IE, how does a 
loaded Fat Trader, sitting horizontal on a Size B world, generate enough 
thrust upward, to get the tail down so that the primary vector can generate 
that 400% thrust?  According to the SOM, a maximum of 25% thrust (that\'s 1G 
at 400% overdrive) can be generated 90 degrees from the attitude of the 
M-drive plates.

It\'s easily designed into a starport (hydraulic lift pads or CG plates 
built into the launch pads) to provide the correct launch attitude, but 
wilderness landings can be a bit touchy!

In TNE/FF&S the conta-grav unit nullifies almost all the gravity, so the
drive doesn\'t have to work against the planet. I\'m not sure how it works in
T4.

I wish I had a copy of that book.  ;-> I know it is supposed to do a good
job of describing DGP\'s idea of how the technology worked, but does it give
really good descriptions of what each of the crew is actually doing?

That\'s the SOM explanation, sure enough, I\'ve heard it rated,
debated, and berated often enough!  ;-> It makes sense to me that you could
"overpower", ie. run your equipment at over 100%, for a short period, but
I\'ve always questioned 400%.

Personally, and you know me <g>, I allow overloading by a few
percent (up to 30% at best) with increased chances of failure and greatly
decreased MTBF..and maintenance cycles.  The *skills* of the operator and
the maintainer are the keys here.  For a maneuver drive the Engineer\'s
Asset (skill+attribute) is the % above 100 at which he can "tweak" up the
drive.  The Pilot\'s Asset is the % at which he could actually fly the
drive.  

When it comes to maintenance, you should rate the drive.  The
standard maneuver drive needs an overhaul every year..that\'s, let\'s say,
every 1000 hours of use at 100% or less.  I say that every hour, or part of
an hour over 100% is the same as 10 hours at 100%. This means every lift or
launch at >100% costs 10 hours in Maint time.  

Do I have a line on the ship\'s Stat Sheet?  Yep!  ;-> One for all the major
components.  Maintenance and repair reduce the numbers, use (and especially
overloading) increases the numbers.  When the number exceeds the Component
rating then I start making failure rolls.  ;-> A major overhaul (yearly
maintenance) drops the number to 0.


Eris,
    if I keep this up you\'ll think I\'m a detail freak! ;->

In the same way.

At light speed, all electromagnetic radiation travels at the same speed in
a vacuum. In other media (air, glass, etc.) the speed is different, though
I don\'t know if it varies by frequency.

It\'s one of the factors in the target solution. In 2300AD it\'s a huge
factor in space warfare (makes for interesting in-system ops :)

Pretty much the same way.

Yeah, what he said!  Well, the charge should be what the market will
bear..or the government will let you charge.

If the market rules, then the prices will be lower on well travelled routes
with lots of competition, and much higher on backwater
routes.  Distance will matter, time will matter, what will really matter is
covering fixed and variable costs.

If the government sets the prices, then...you might well have flat rates. 
The prices would be averaged to allow costs to be covered on *average*
routes, or maybe there would be subsidies to increase travel, or maybe
disincentives to decrease travel.

Yes, please.  How about preparing a Balance Sheet and Income
Statement for a typical Free Trader?

on spinal mounts, let us say, but that\'s just a feeling.  Perhaps a move
from the "unrestricted" to the "restricted" list is most logical.

  As for the feel of ships designed with meson guns, well, I always liked
them (and screens) - they were the closest thing that CT had to magic
weapons, and it was a great way to get the players\' attention.

  As for meson screens, well, if you have meson guns you gotta have them,
otherwise in game terms combat becomes nasty, brutish, and short as huge
spinal mounts blow everything up.  As they are deliniated now, meson
screens rapidly become more expensive in volume, power, and cash as you
get above minimal levels.  Small ships can\'t carry big screens, so the
dominance of the big meson tubes is preserved.

I see your point, Richard.  An enterprising young tramp freighter 
captain with a Jump-2 starship could come in to a situation where 
only Jump-1 starships operate and clean up.  Nobody would want to use 
the Jump-1 ships unless all of their cargos were going only 1 parsec 
away--which it is highly unlikely that they all are going only 1 
parsec.

But, let me play devil\'s advocate here.  Maybe this system evolved 
because of the economics involved.

On Earth, transportation to farther places costs the transportation 
companies more to get their deliveries there--therefore we are used 
to higher costs for longer distances.

This is not so in the Traveller universe.  A starship captain incurrs 
the same expense whether he is jumping one parsec or two.

The time in jump space is the same.  The cost for fuel is the same.  
Since the time is the same, the cost for life support is the same.  
In fact, I can\'t think of one expense that is greater if you take 
your starship 2 parsecs rather than one.  

Starships with greater jump range have an advantage because they can 
deliver to more places.  This gives them a step up over the Jump-1 
guys if a cargo is being sent far.

But, the Jump-2 guys can offer no advantage over the Jump-1 guys when 
a cargo is only going one parsec, and this is probably what keeps the 
Jump-1 guys in business.

That, and the fact that the Jump-1 guys congregate in the lesser 
travelled parts of space where the people needing transportation are 
just glad to see a ship.  Even if you are sending a cargo three 
parsecs away, you have to weigh the costs of waiting a long time for 
that Jump-3 starship to show up and take your cargo vs a Jump-1 that 
can get it one third the way to its destination today--or even take 
the cargo the full 3 parsecs at three times the cost.

Is three times the cost worth it?  It is if you can\'t afford to wait 
three months before that Jump-3 starship shows up when the 
Jump-1ship, here today, can get it there in three weeks.

And, that\'s just my two cents, for whatever its worth (definitely not 
two cents, I\'m sure!)

  I agree - I\'ve solicited feedback on this issue in the past, but got
little response.  Looks like few folks actually do ship combat on a
regular basis, at least with T4 - the folks who responded talked in terms
of High Guard, mostly.

  True, but if the defensive weaponry for sale is essentially useless (as
you seem to suggest), why is it out there?  Aside from the possibility
that it exists to make the crew feel better about their chances of
survival, I\'d tend to say that if the sandcasters and nuclear dampers
don\'t work as they should, fix the combat system so they do.

  I think the metaphor that would be more appropriate is "Cars that drive
around in Mogadishu, Somalia should have guys with Kalashnikovs in the
back and armor on the sides because there are lots of folks with guns
about."  My reading of M0 background material leads me to believe that
interstellar trade outside the Imperium can be dangerous - that\'s why so
many folks welcome the coming of the Imperium and the peace and stability
it brings (not to mention the money).

  True, which is why you don\'t have meson screens alone - you mount all
the other defensive systems as well.  The point of the discussion was not
to stand up and survive indefinitely - it is to survive just long enough
to engage the jump drive and run away.  The only defense against meson
guns is a meson screen - armor does not work, as I go into in more detail
below.

  Finally, it is a fundamental misconception that only BIG meson weapons
are mounted on warships.  QSDS includes a meson bay weapon that does
(+4)2/3-2-0-0; at 125 tons and only 27.8MW it will fit on a rather small
ship.  Meson weapons are a key technology for TL-12 navies who fight TL-11
or less opponents - since the meson guns bypass armor they give a major
advantage.

  True, but the screen reduces the damage, giving you better odds.
Moreover, not all these sites will be working at peak efficiency - they
are relics, after all.

  By the way, I never said that the screens provided complete protection
against such an attack - just an extra margin of protection at a
relatively reasonable price.

> firing their deep meson guns at you???? Stupid!

  It seems you are not familiar with the planet of TL-16+ robots the
Vilani encountered during the expansion of the First Empire.  They just
shot everyone who entered the system with meson weapons - the internal
explosions scared the Vilani to no end.  It was not until the Rule of Man
(I think) when meson screen equiped ships were avalible that contact with
the inhabitants was made (so to speak - those robots were very rude). 

  By the way, that is one reason the Vilani collapsed in the Nth
Interstellar War - the newly developed Meson weapons the Terrans used were
just like those mysterious weapons those nasty robots had been using, and
it scared the Vilani again.

  The name of the planet is S-something - again, I hate not having my
reference material!  Perhaps someone could dig out the name and the place
where the info first appeared (an issue of Challenge, perhaps?)

  Anyway, the point of this is that the inhabitants of the planet (or the
defense system computer someone left on accidently) may not need a
rational reason for opening up with their meson gun.  Of course, it always
helps to be polite. :-)

  It seems you have a fundamental misunderstanding of meson weaponry here.
They bypass armor and cause internal damage directly.  More armor does not
help - only meson screens are armor against meson weapons.  This has been
part of Traveller since CT days, and still is - the T4 combat system
mentions this, if I am not mistaken.

  Armor has other problems - it is heavy, particularly on large ships, so
it inhibits acceleration.  It is also not an option for QSDS designers,
since armor is fixed in the hulls they can use.

  We just have to agree to disagree here, but I think you might want to
reconsider based on armor not being effective against meson weaponry.  I\'d
also argue that a trader in a high-risk area might well have a use for
advanced EMM.

  Remember, this is an "Exploratory Trader," going to places outside the
Imperium that by definition are less safe.  Precautions are essential that
in normal trading practice in the Imperium would be unwarrented.

Not really as that 3G gravity well is well, a well (couldn\'t resist). This
means that gravity goes down at inverse r^2 rate so that 3 G (a gasgiant?)
will not be all that useful to spaceships. The advantage of CG thrust prop
to Gravity is that all grav vehicles with CG thrsut before multiplying bu
gravity > mass will allow the grav vehicle to fly at all gravities and it
is a better handwave for grav drop off than say "drops of to 1% at 10
diameters" or such nonsense.

One proposal was to make CG be proportional to gravity but powerconsumtion
proportional to thrust. This would make low gravity high thrust impractical
due to the huge amount of CG thrusters needed and high gravity high thrust
would also be impractical due to high power consumtion. This however
negates the advantage of making all gravvehicles with CG thrust equal mass
float as the larger the gravity the more power would be needed.

Good question. I haven\'t seen it either.

As far as I could ever tell, it seemed to be by shape or tradition - the
icosahedron looks like a drop of water, the tetrahedron looks (a very little
bit) like a flame; the cube has been a symbol of solid things since before
his time, and there are supposedly 8 winds. However, he\'s the one we get the

understanding of atoms, electrons or molecules...?

I always used a few simple rules of thumb; since the starport is usually the
first thing built on a colony world, it would be right on the prime meridian
(center line). If the world was pre-settled, the sky\'s the limit. A bit of
general knowledge about weather patterns helps place it where the weather is
not too chaotic, and for low-tech cultures nearer the equator is better due
to the "spin boost" factor.

If you\'re talking about a newly discovered world, then the word "arbitrary"
springs to mind. One of the first steps in a mapping survay is to establish
a base meridian from which everything else can be measured. Aliens looking
at Earth from space can\'t spot longitude lines any more than they can spot
national borders...

Hope that helps...

Military Goods, Luxuries and Essentials.

Most worlds import military equipment, particularily hi-tech 
military equipment. A world has a 10% chance of importing 
equipment of one tech level lower, a 40% chance of having a
policy of defense self-reliance (and thus not importing any
military equipment), a 30% chance of importing military
equipment from one TL higher and a 20% chance of importing
military equipment of the highest TL in existance (rolls of
2-3,4-7,8-9 and 10-12 respectivly is close enough).

A world importing military goods will import 2d6*3 percent of
it\'s Army budget and 1d6% of it\'s Navy budget in military goods
per year (military budgets average 3% of GNP. Army budgets are,
on average, 30% of the total defense budget). This includes
spare parts, as well as new equipment. It does not include
complete starships and SDBs, as these will not be bought
on an annual basis.

Military goods cost one Imperial megacredit per ton, and are 
imported from the closest non-non Industrial world of the 
required TL, reachable within the ruling Jump technology,
regardless of range (if there is an Industrial world of the
relevant TL within 120% of that distance, the world will 
import the military goods from there instead).

Luxury goods are of two types - luxury goods of mass consumption 
and luxury goods of elite consumption. Examples of luxury goods
of mass consumption are things like coffee and VCRs - things
bought by the mass of the population with their surplus income.
Luxury goods of elite consumption are bought by the rich, and
are things like Rolls Royce cars, anagathic drugs and Old Masters.

A world will spend 2d6% of it\'s GDP on luxury goods, modidifed by 
the planetary income modifiers for Rich, Poor, Non-Industrial 
worlds and so on ( yes, this involves a "doubling up" of luxury 
expenditure, as luxuries will be a higher percentage of a higher
planetary GDP. The logic is that a wealthier world will have more
disposable income, and thus a higher propensity to consume luxuries).

A world will have a income dispersion (ID) of 2d6, with 0 representing 
total equality of income and 15 representing total income inequality.

A world will spend 6*ID percent of it\'s luxury import expenditure on
elite luxury goods, and the remainder on luxury goods of mass consumption.

Elite luxury goods cost one Imperial megacredit per ton, and are imported
from anywhere and everywhere. On average, 20% come from Capital, 30% from
within the sector, 30% from worlds outside the sector but within the
Imperium and 20% from outside the Imperium.

Mass luxury goods cost 1d6* 5000 credits per ton, and are shipped from 2d6
worlds within the subsector and adjoining subsectors.

If the ship has wings then it could probably take off with 1G thrust on a
2G planet but my design system handles that. It calculates stall speeds (ie
takeoff speed) at various air pressures, gravities etc.
My M-drives can be tricked (by some pretty hairy Engineer rolls) into
producing up to 50% more thrust but that requires more power as well.

Yep, light is light is light. The difference between radio waves and gamma
rays is not their speed, but their energy. Now, does the speed of light vary
by frequency if it\'s not travelling through a vacuum?

Next time it rains, turn your back to the sun. If you see a big arc
of white light in the sky, the speed of light is constant for all
frequencies. If you see a bunch of different coloured bands, it varies. ;)

Good point. I never even looked at the damage.  Don\'t know what I was thinking.

I just have Battle Rider, it doesn\'t mention how many targets a MFD can fire upon.

The extra MFD was left over from the time when I had 6 missile turrets.
Starships, listed turrets as having 3, turrets, but I found out that
this was a typo so I changed it to 3 Missile barbettes.  I just forgot
to delete the extra MFD.  


>	You have 28 crew but only 25 workstations.  Are the other

Well first of all I made a mistake when I added up the crew, there are
only 27 crew members. Two of these are maintence, and they don\'t
require Workstations.

I added a standard 50 Ton missile bay from SSDS, I\'ll save the custom
Missile Bay for my next SDB, the Chimera. A 900 ton SDB, with over 25 
missile MFDs.  It is intended to sit inside of a gas giant, with dozens
of missiles prelaunched and just passvily waiting for an enemy.  When
an enemy is detected, it activates the waiting missiles and launches
them all at the enemy.  The missiles will have to be modified, so that
they will stay at a constant depth in the gas giant. They will need
contra grav and a thruster to keep them up, since contra grav only gets
rid of 99% of the weight. Does this seem like a viable tactic to everyone?
 
Changes from the original:
I switched from four laser turrets to two laser barbettes.
I switched from missile barbettes to a missile bay.
THe extra mass and volume was taken out of the fuel and cargo.
- ----
I never thought that the SDB as presented in the TNE rulebook was any
good, so I decided to make up my own version. I used SSDS, with FFS
additions.  It used Heplar to allow TNE fans to use it, and it also
keeps the cost down.  Thruster plates would have added another 100 MCr
to the price.  The Griffen uses the 15 ton rule of thumb in FFS.  If a
ship weighs less than 15 tons per displacment ton, it can use the
10tons of thrust per displacment ton rule.  I had to sacrifice some
armor and weaponry to keep this legal. The write up will assume a
Reformation Coaltion campaign, but if change the names to Sylea or
something else, you can use the ship in a Milieu 0 campaign.
 

The Griffen has significant more firepower than the TNE SDB.  It is
also over three times the price.  The main cost comes from the improved
sensors. If you assume that SDBs will only be found inside of Gas
Giants or planetary oceans, linked into a huge sensor net, the poor
sensors of the TNE SDB can be justified.  I thought the Griffen should
be capable of performing a wider range of missions.  The other
increased cost is the extra MFDs to control the large number of
missiles.  There are some tradeoffs in the design.  The Griffen has
less armor than the TNE SDB, it also has less fuel available for the Heplar.  

Write up:
The Griffen SDB was developed by Standard Astronics as a replacment for
the Dragon class of SDBs.  It was thought that the Dragons were unable
to fully protect the system against maruders.  The Griffen is upgunned,
it has replaced the Dragon\'s laser turrets with laser barbettes.
Instead of missile barbettes, it has a 50 ton missile bay, which will
allow the Griffen to put out many more missiles than the Dragon.   It
also has an improved sensor suite.  The Dragon was designed for
coordinated operation with a planetary sensor net.  The Griffen was
built for this, but also for independent operation.  It also has room
for 10 marines, without forcing the rest of the crew to hot bunk. 

The Griffen was built as a interceptor.  If hostile forces appeared in
system, but didn\'t assualt the gas giant, then most of the stationary
defenses would be useless.  The Griffen is capable of taking up station
in deep space and waiting for an enemy to appear.  It often does this
near system jump in spots.  Merchants are told to jump into a certain
volume of space. The SDBs can patrol this volume easier than if
merchants come in where ever they want.  Of course Pirates know where
the Merchants will jump into also, but that is what the SDBs are for.  

The inside of the ship is bright and clean.  There is a fair bit of
room for the crew to operate.  There are extra staterooms, either for
ship\'s troops or to give the crew more room.  The Aubani navy places a
premium on the morale of its sailors.  To help with this, the ship has
an excellent mess.  The ship is too small to carry a full time steward,
but the gunners are used as cooking staff.  The other enlisted crew on
the ship are required to peform kp duty several times a week.  This is
the only way a small ship, can still have freshly cooked meals.  The
other option would be to have several tons of frozen diners in the
cargo bay.  Faced with this option the crew cheerfully pitches in.  
There are also several state of the art entertainment centers for the
crew to relax with.  There is an extensive library of holovids for the
crew to watch.  The crew is also offered incentives to take self paced
computer taught courses.  These courses can be any subject which
intrests the sailor.  Many sailors use these courses to get a start on
a college degree, for a life after the service.  To remind the sailors
of home, there is a large (9m^3) terrarium in the main crew lounge. 
This makes the ship a little less sterile, and also helps out the life
support systems by producing some fresh oxygen.

Whoops - did I say that? Ah, hm, er... what I meant was that from the way I
read the T4 basic starship combat rules, when you get hit, you lose
armour. Whether you get hit by missles, lasers, PA guns or meson guns, 
the more armour you have, the longer you\'re likely to last.

I do believe that if a meson gun shot hits (ie. doesn\'t completely 
go in the wrong direction) it takes some armour but also gets an
internal hit roll automatically. I don\'t have my rulebook here right
now though, so I could be wrong. Sandcasters, nuclear dampers and
meson screens can stop you from getting hit in the first place.

Sorry about that,
Ethan

You don\'t use the M-Drive you use the Contra Grav lifters which produce
thrust equal to the gravity field (for 1G Contra Grav, usually installed
on starships).  The 25% thrust (or 100% if tail down) gained by
vectoring the engines can then easily lift the ship away from the
planet. 

Someone else mentioned the Fat Trader,

In T4 the Fat trader is an airframe hull, which allows it to take off
like a normal aeroplane (it may require a longer runway though),
assuming the planet has sufficient atmosphere.  For planets without
atmospheres (which are usually low gravity anyway) it would take off in
the usual manner.  No need to use strap on boosters, or unreasonable
hand waving.

One of my players used his grav belt at full speed in a corridor.
His last words were "punch it". He smoked the far wall and killed 
himself.

Another character was flying an air/raft in the Horde adventure.
The air/raft was full of PC\'s, gear and two of the Chamax. She was 
flying over a "herd" of Chamax. To get rid of the two on the air/raft,
uttered the now famous (in our group) phrase "hang on, we\'re gonna
roll". She rolled the air/raft and blewed the Grav Vehicle skill check
badly. The air/raft rolled upside down, most of the PC\'s fell out
(they weren\'t strapped in because they were fighting the two Chamax).
The few PC\'s that didn\'t, including the pilot, were killed when
the air/raft plunged into the Chamax herd on the ground.

I agree, it would certainly be less restricted than a meson gun, but
you know... meson screens start  at one TL higher than meson guns -
that is, it\'s easier to discover/build a meson gun than it is to
defend against them. Perhaps it\'s the meson screen that is the real
military secret. Imagine, after years of blowing ships to pieces
in a single shot with your meson gun, you come across an enemy
who is completely immune to it... yipes!

Yeah, they get your attentition alright... I always thought they were
pretty well handwaved, they were certainly thought out better than
thrusters and jump drive.

Well, yeah - I like my space combat nasty, brutish and short if it\'s
a meson cannon against someone without a screen. Naval ships that go
into real, big, epic space battles are on a different plane of existance
from the average player\'s ship - you don\'t mix the two. If the players
say "We slam the thrusters to full and rush the Imperial crusier",
they should see a lot of turrets coming to bear on them just before
their ship is vapourized, their sandcasters notwithstanding.

Anyways, if people want to mount meson screens on their ships, they
should probably be able to do it, but I\'d like to see a situation
where a trader\'s meson screen is going to make the slightest difference
in real combat.

PS. To Eris - ok, so what if it\'s a magic gun? You can take your new task
 system and your singularity gun and go run whatever game you want!

In TNE/FF&S the conta-grav unit nullifies almost all the gravity, so the
drive doesn\'t have to work against the planet. I\'m not sure how it works in
T4.

Based on the fact that you need to have 1g worth of thrust according to all

same premise as a \'repulsorlift\' system in that "other Sci-Fi game" :)

If this is so, could it be posible to build a repulsor beam weapon using CG

it just a question of tech levels?

By the time the ships are far enough apart for time lag to have game 
effects, the beams are so spread out that they\'re ineffective as weapons, 
as far as I know.

>communications and time lags in your games?

It depends on the situation, of course.  If the PCs want to communicate 
with NPCs who are light minutes away, they tell me their message, 
continue with whatever they\'re doing, and then I interrupt with the 
response, etc., keeping good track of game time all the while.  Sometimes 
it doesn\'t make any difference, and we just handle it as if it were 
instantaneous communications, but still keep track of game time (e.g., 
the conversation took 2 minutes in real time, but consisted of 6 
exchanges between parties one light-minute apart, so 8 minutes of game 
time have elapsed).

I see you\'ve learned to speak Vargr! ;->

You know, it\'s not the *concept* of the meson cannon I hate..I\'m reasonably
comfortable waving my hands over that..I just don\'t like weapons that
bypass the armor and hit the inside of the ship. That\'s just not
\'estheticly\' pleasing.  I *do* like deep site meson cannon for defending
planets though.

As for the singularity gun, the more I think about it the more seriously
I\'m taking it.  Traveller already has well developed gravity control,
people have been waving their hands over grav focusing since TNE, so with
the proper hand movements I don\'t see why we couldn\'t come up with another
"magic gun."  ;->

I\'m not even going to talk about task systems!

And now for something completely different...

    How many G could an AG gen, if an AG could gen G?

All real space traveller communications take place at light speed.  Radio,
radar, maser, and Meson communicators all take place at light speed.  Light
is slowed when going through a refractive medium such as water, but this is
a small enough effect that it really does not matter.

All jump space communications are carried on a vessel, and take a week.

c, the speed of light in a vacuum.

The homing beacon is always on and always transmitting, so as soon as they
arrive, they get access to the information that was as being sent out
several seconds ago.  There will be a lag before they show up on ground
side scanners, and also a lag before ground side response can be heard by
the vessel.

This is what makes wartime so interesting.  Homing beacons are often off,
and ships leave their transponders off, so "shoot first" responses are far
more likely.

Either it can be overdriven, or CG also nullifies gravity.  I make it be
something that can be overdriven.

see a way in which this would fundamentally alter canon?  It might make the

 It also means there are fewer backwaters as the tech level goes up.

Unlike changing the jump time, it seems to preserve major parts of canon,
unlike altering jump time, or making jump an FTL realspace drive.

This will dramatically alter canon, making the majority of vessels in the
1100 era jump 2 capable, but I am willing to live with that

I was thinking of something like making jump drive fuel drop by 10 percent
per tech level.  I am not sure if I want to fiddle with the size of the
jump drive itself, but I likely will.  (My target is to make more interior
room for passengers for civilian ships, thereby dropping passage prices.  I
also want to make bigger guns and more armor feasible.)

19	3.9	8.6	14.3	21.3	30	39.4

At tech 19, a jump drive plus fuel becomes small enough that a 10 ton craft
can mount a full drive for a 100t ship.  I rule that a flexible jump grid
is hard to make, so that it cannot be plated around a cargo quickly until
tech level 17 or 18.

It is true, to a lesser extent, in Traveller as well.

Not quite true.  A jump 2 capable ship would have a large chunk of its
volume taken up by drives and fuel that make it cost more per passenger or
ton of cargo to operate.  Further, it has to pay off the extra expense
those drives cost.

Even given a jump 2 ship, you pay more for fuel, unless you scoop it.
Admittedly, this is a lesser effect.

>The time in jump space is the same.  The cost for fuel is the same.  
>Since the time is the same, the cost for life support is the same.  
>In fact, I can\'t think of one expense that is greater if you take

If you ship is a J2, you have to compete with J1 vessels, so even though it
does not cost you a lot more beyond amortized costs, you are matching
prices with people running cheaper ships.  You just have to hope that you
will make enough more on your J2 hops that the extra drives were worth
installing, which is why a J2 trip should cost more.  J1 ships need to make
two jumps, and J2 ships need to pay off more expensive drives.

In my world, you pay per parsec, with a J2 ship getting you there faster
than a J1 ship, and thus being able to undercut the "two jump" J1 ships
while still making more money per passenger over a two week period.  I am
working on ways to cram more passengers into a ship, so we can drop the
prices of star travel by a significant factor.

BTW, what does it cost now to ship something via an overseas carrier, and
how long does it take?  If nobody knows, I will call a shipping company,
but I suspect someone on the list knows the answer off the top of their
head.  Assume bulk cargo like that carried in Traveller starships.

hostels, starships jumping to empty space and allowing passengers to buy
passage to the next planet or get off here, should be so obvious I will
mention only these few examples. Since the cost in equipment, crew, fuel,
and technology of higher jump numbers will not be compensated by higher
revenues, it would be financially insane for any commercial vessel to have
greater than Jump-1 at any tech level. The only way for ships to avoid this
trap is to only travel back and forth between two planets a single jump
from each other. Not only is this situation absurd, but it is contrary to
the Traveller canon of free traders plying far reaches of space.

[Douglas replies:]  But who is going to sell you a 200 jump ticket?  (Let 
me rephrase that, as I know of several PC\'s that would take advantage of 
anyone naive enough to try and buy one...)  What starship line will sell 
you a 200 jump ticket at single fare prices?
I don\'t know how it\'s run in other campaigns, but this is the way I\'ve 
always seen it played, and play it myself.

Example: Even tho\' a ship regularly makes the Efate - Regina (1 jump) run, 
the captain only posts passenger destinations of 1 Jump and cargo 
destinations of 2 jumps down the line.  Yes, he makes sure the rumor mill 
is very aware that he is making the entire run, but you can\'t have your 
fare caps slapped down for _rumour_.

The only reason I even consider cargo for 2 jumps is to ensure I get 
maximum profit out of the hold, if there is an empty corner, it\'s a loss. 
 If I can fill the hold on cargo for just the next jump, then I won\'t 
consider taking on any excess.  Remember, a good broker/trader can (and 
should) make back his pay, plus a generous profit!

With few exceptions, there are almost always more passengers available than 
there are staterooms (otherwise, why would anyone travel via tramp starship 
when luxury starliners make the runs), so why should the starcaptains even 
consider selling multi-jump tickets to travellers?

Yeah. That is certainly one way of doing it... it comes down to
whether you think the descriptions should be more "canon" than the
rules. I\'m arguing from the point of view that the combat rules are
the "superior canon", though I don\'t necessarily believe this to be 
true. I think that the point of all of this is not just to come up
with a better ship design, but to see if the combat system jives with
the descriptions we\'ve been given of how things work.

I have a tendancy to use metaphors a bit excessively, so you\'ll have to
excuse me if they start to get stretched. Anyhow, your point is well taken,
but, as you\'ll see a bit further on, I think there is a better analogy...

Did Meson bays appear in HG or MT? Hm. I saw them in SSDS just now,

I wasn\'t trying to imply that. It\'s just that the "extra margin of 
protection" for a small meson screen is still pretty small. If
"reduces the damage" removes all chances of internal explosions,
than it\'s pretty good, but if it just reduces the number of internal
damage rolls from 5 to 1, well, I guess you\'re better off, but you
still might lose your maneuver drive or explode.

Uh, yeah, I\'m unfamiliar with it! Geez, and I consider myself pretty
"up" on Imperial history. I\'ve heard about the TL16 robot-run
self-isolated system, but I didn\'t know that they introduced the
Vilani to the miracle of the Meson Gun...

I had thought that the Terrans had given the Vilani their first
taste of being on the wrong end of meson weaponry... gee, that\'s too
bad, it kinda take some of the punch out of the Terran victory.
The ROM is one of the most intersting period of Imperial history,
IMO.

Hm, well, yes, but it seems kind of odd to spend 20-odd MCr on a defence
for a situation where you\'re in an unknown system which is hostile,
has deep meson weaponry, which it fires on you, but that also has absolutely
no other means of defence. How many times do GMs plan on using this
setup? 

Now, if you _are_ in that situation, if you have a meson screen, you have 
a few minutes to fire a capsule containing your last will and testament
before the meson gun gets lucky and pentrates the screen, whereas if
you don\'t have a meson screen, well, no one gets to read your will. It\'s
a pretty small difference.

I understand how meson weaponry works, I made a mistake in my wording.
In T4 (please, someone correct me if I\'m wrong!), all weapons, if they
hit, do armour damage. Even meson weapons. The bonus with meson guns 
is that they get a free roll (multiple rolls?) on the internal explosion/
damage table.  There isn\'t anything that can be done with a meson gun
that can\'t be done with a lucky 10Mj laser shot though. The more
armour you have, the longer you can stand up in battle, regardless of
what\'s shooting at you and as long as your don\'t get a "ship explodes"
roll.

I think tonight I am going to have to go through my T4 rulebook in detail
to put this to rest (not that I\'m absolutely sure I\'m right - I\'m just getting
a bit tired of making arguments based on my poor memory of the T4 rules.)

Which is why lightly armoured traders shouldn\'t get into fights. The idea
that you can have a trader that can put up even a modest defence against
even the crappiest military ship is silly, IMO. Having a meson screen
on a trader is like wearing a bulletproof vest to the movies - slight
overkill. (It isn\'t to say no one gets shot in movie theaters, but it\'s
fairly rare). Also, some worlds might not like such heavily defended
ships - "He wouldn\'t have a meson screen if he wasn\'t lookin\' for
trouble..."

Again, I realize that armour isn\'t a defence against meson weaponry per se
 - it does help, uh, absorb the blows so to speak. As for EMM, yeah, it
might be useful, depending on who you\'re planning on trading with. And
I never said it was useful - I said I\'d mount it before I\'d mount a meson
screen, making it the second-least-useful thing for a trader.

Well, if it\'s so unsafe that you need to protect your traders against
serious para-military threats, I\'d say to send in more than one ship.
Then you can have one ship fight while the one with all the goodies in the
hold runs and warms up ye ol\' jump drive.

To use a metaphor again, Brinks trucks don\'t have bank tellers in them -
they have security guards in them. In banks, you don\'t give each teller
a gun. You have tellers, you have security guards. If you\'re sending a 
trader into territory that\'s _that_ dangerous, send an armed escort.
(Though it better be worth a _lot_ of money to go to that kind of trouble)

Another option - can anyone but the Syleans do 3G inertial compensation?
If not, stick everyone in G-tanks and you\'re guaranteed to be able to
outrun any other human ship in space. Pulling 1 to 3 Gs away from trouble
is probably as good a defence as sandcasters and dampers are.


Tonight I will consult my rulebook and try to find some answers to my own
questions to resolve this!

Actually, the traditional CT fat trader is a 400t subsidized
merchant-- a ship that is built around an airframe hull.  The wings
are what provides the lift necessary to allow a fully loaded fat
trader to lift off.  Of course, you have to fall back on the
"overdrive" theory for airless worlds.

 Well, in any discussion I\'ve seen, what ends up happening is
 that the line that goes through the center of the most
 prominent and distinctive feature visible from orbit becomes
 the zero meridian for mapping (Olympus Mons, for example, on
 Mars); once the planet is colonized, it sometimes stays the
 same; sometimes it gets shifted to the site of touchdown, or
 the center of First Settlement.

 On tidally-locked worlds (1:1 rotation/revolution lock), the
 job becomes a little easier; zero is either the noon line
 (most often), the sunrise line, or the sunset line.

 Yes, you and I agree on the genetics.  I\'m merely suggesting a
 somewhat different physical arrangement.  Not _significantly_
 different from the main run of humanity, or from your
 gedankendesign for the Sayat, but different enough to get
 people wondering - and _not_ jury-rigged; I don\'t see _any_
 geneering team finding that acceptable.  What if you don\'t have
 a turkey baster or materials to make one?

 And are you referring to these "dangly bits" (or at least the
 most prominent bit) I got here as an ovipostor? (Well, no,
 because it doesn\'t postor ovis, but you know what I mean...)
 Even ova, which are pretty large as cells go, are small enough
 to negotiate the route...

That\'s why I subscribe to this list--to be reminded of something that 
I should already know.

Thanks,

Yes.  The chapters are:

Ch1  Maneuver Drive

Ch2  Flight Controls

Ch3  Jump Drive

Ch4  Power Plant and Fuel

Ch5  Sensors, Communicators, and Transponders

Ch6  Main Computer and Security

Ch7  Hull and Environment

Ch8  Cargo and Passangers

Ch9  Weapons and Screens

Ch10 Crew Duties



And, besides this, there are extended game rules in the back of the 
book for starship operations.  Things like airlock cycling, control 
settings for iris valves, and antihijack tranq gas are covered.

You can also role play all of the tasks involved in take off and 
landing of a ship through to jump point.  The books lists tasks for 
each crew position to make.

And, there\'s procedures for wilderness refueling from gas giants, 
oceans, icy moons, asteroid belts, etc, as well as annual maintenance 
notes, jump mishaps, and basic repair guides for all systems on the 
ship.

To answer your question, chapter 10 deals directly with crew duties, 
but throughout the book, you get an idea of what the appropriate crew 
member has to do.

For example, in the flight controls section, theres a lengthy section 
of all of the variables a navigator has to deal with when plotting a 
course for either normal space or jump space.

I love this book.  I recommend you find it if you don\'t have it.

No, I love details.  The gods lie in the details and make the game 
more enjoyable.  Unfortunately, my players don\'t always agree with 
me.

"Why do we need to know how the J-Drive works?  Isn\'t it enough that 
it just goes?"

Oh, brother.  You see what I mean.
