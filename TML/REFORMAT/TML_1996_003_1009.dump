Gotta agree with you here, although not completely.  I\'m enough of a

I won\'t have a stab at the formal language, because it\'s the tail end 
of a long day at work, and I can\'t get the left brain/right brain 
connection to click.  Some of the points though are

What are the reasons for the Empire\'s founding?  
In my mind, the opening statment will be that the greatest thing 
about the age is travel among the stars, etc, etc.  The argument then 
follows onto discussion of the fragility of space, of how worlds can 
get lost in the vastness of it all, without a common binding force.

That force is, you guessed it, the Empire.

Is there a rational argument proffered for the establishment of a 
feudal style government structure?  Why Empire instead of, for 
instance, a United Federation of Planets (are those rocks I hear?)

The Empire does rule the space between the stars.  I like the sound 
of this.  It is stated somewhere implicitly that worlds are not 
forced or compelled to join (of course, the economic implications of 
not joining are serious)

Statement of cultural sovereignty: all worlds are allowed to maintain 
their own culture and laws, except within a fixed area of a spaceport 
and Imperial embassy.  There would also be the establishment of 
cultural standards for the Empire.  Is there a common language stated 
for Imperial business, etc?

The establishment of free trade, as well as the establishment of a 
navy and marines to protect space to protect free trade.

Let\'s toss around theoretical points for a while (could I stop 
you???) and then make a stab at the flowery language version.

No, it\'s much more than that. The parallels to Nazi Germany are

First, I was struck by the mere number of gaming fanatics.  I read that
30,000 people attended last years convention.  This translated into huge
lines at registration during the middle of the day.  

Bratwurst seemed to be the best that Milwaukee could do for food.  There
were beer vendors in selected areas, but the root beer was better.

Games going on everywhere.  Every table was (at most times) filled with
games and gamers.  In some areas the floor was filled too.  The most
popular I saw were CCGs, especially Magic.  I also ran into a room where
almost every single table (and there were a lot) had a game of Axis and
Allies on it.  There were historical games played with hundreds of lead
figures on detailed \'diarama\' style playing surfaces, games with 12" Tall
Battlemechs doing combat, games with teddy bears on a playing surface
which was a bed, games played on computers over a network, games games
games.

My Favorite Booths; Imperium Games (which shared it\'s booth with another
company) where I met Marc Miller (nice guy!), Ken Whitman,  Greg Porter,
Cherie Whitman (she did my dog tag) and a couple of other IG employees,
Also, Larry Elmore had another booth (his own) and was selling original
artwork (fantasy, not sci-fi).  

I loved Crazy Igors, where I spent over $100 on
such gems as; Starship Troopers board game, JOTAS\'s (about 5, 3 of which
were bests of) a few Megatraveller 15mm deck plans (which were expensive;
like $12.00), A Judges Guild adventure, and a few other choice items.  
I saw Hivers & Ithkur, flipped thru it, put it back, unimpressed.  I saw
Striker 2, flipped through it, added up what I already wanted, put it back
(with a small sob). 


I saw only 1 Megatraveller Journal (the one I have) how many were put out?
I did not find K\'Kree (only many copies of Aslan) of the CT Alien Modules,
There are several copies of Asteroid by GDW, but none of Imperium. Poor
Dave Golden picked up a mint copy of Mayday only to find that it was
missing the rules book.

Other Booths I liked; RAFM which had only a few Traveller minatures left
(and I had no money by then anyway) , Chainmail Fashions (for the
salespersons), Wizards of the Coast (whose CCG Netrunner has possible
Traveller applications), The many Dice vendors (I picked up hit
location, crit, and 3-sided dice.  

I met Kevin Knight (they were selling the Traveller Chronicle at the IG
booth), Harold Hale, I saw Joe Walsh & Family (but didn\'t introduce myself
since he was deep into a game, and of course, Dave Golden (Thanks again for 
the great Starship Combat sessions Dave!).

Did anyone see Loren Wiseman, he is the only one of the Traveller people I
would have liked to meet but didn\'t.

All in all a great time was had by me.

By the way, never smile at a Klingon unless you mean it.

P.S. In another post I would like to recreate the rules of the ship to
ship combat system as played.

    'body' => 'Here is the errata/potential errata I\'ve found so far:

Step 2, the text directs you to "select a hull from the table on the next
page".  The actual chart it is refering to is on page 107, which is 15
pages later.

Step 3, the text says, "on the following table, cross-index the jump level
desired with the size of hull".  There is no such table, not below nor
anywhere else in the book, making it impossible to design jump capable
ships.

Step 6, the text indicates that missile launchers "do not have to be
crewed when operating as part of a missile battery under the control of
a master fire director", but in Step 9 the text indicates that "one gunner is
required for each weapon, sandcaster and nuclear damper battery
installed".  For missile batteries, is this gunner in addition to the one
required for the MFD?  The two statements seem to contradict each
other.

   Also, I now know why people *really* loved the Third Imperium so
much--missiles were free, shoot all you want!!!  No where have I been
able to find any mention of the *cost* or *displacement* of spare missiles,
which presumably you will need after you shoot off the ready missiles
provided in the turret or barbette (which I guess are also free).

Step 7, Small Craft External Grapples are described, Small Craft Hangars
and Launch Ports (table for which is on page 112) are not.  Fuel
Purification Plants are mentioned on page 89, but not in Step 7, which is
presumably the section they belong in (the table for them appears on
page 111).  Ditto Shops and Labs, which rates a chart on page 111, but
no explanatory text beyond what is on the chart and a brief mention of
Sickbays in Step 9.

Step 10, the text indicates you should, "multiply the number of crew
members that need workstations by the workstation characteristic
above".  One big problem: there is no characteristic above.  The chart
you need is actually located on page 112.

Chart section problems 

The Standard Military Controls table on page 105 indicates that the crew 
requirements for such controls is 0.0 at all tech levels.  Given that the
Standard  Civilian Controls table on the same page gives some number
from 1 to 3, it appears that the crew numbers for SMCs are incorrect.

The Thrust Plate Drive Potential table on 108 is rather awkwardly labeled,
giving one the impression that the Gs column starts at 100!  Easy enough
to figure out that 100 refers to displacement and that Gs run from left to
right, but this should have been done better.

Additional Criticisms

   The beginning of the Spacecraft section promises, "with the systems
in this chapter, a player design nearly any type of spacecraft, up to 5000
tons displacement".  Avoiding a criticism of the grammar used, we
discover that while the Standard Hull Configurations chart does go up to
5000 tons, there is very few options in the configurations you have to
choose from (at 3000, 4000, and 5000 tons there is only one type). 
Also, the minimum size hull is 100 tons displacement.  This means you
can forget designing your own small craft, fighters or jump shuttles for
now.  I would have much preferred that this chart be taken out to a full
page, and a wider variety of standard hulls be presented.  Surely some
company in the Third Imperium makes standard small craft components!

   While it appears that the wholesale errata that plagued MegaTraveller
(aka MegaErrata) has been avoided (thank the Divine Being), this section
is probably the most  poorly laid out of any of the four attempts (classic
T, High Guard, MT, TNE) to present a ship design system in Traveller.
For example, the charts for weapons and defensive systems
(something one would assume you could find all in one place) are
scattered over four separate pages in the charts section.  In attempting
to assemble a 1000 ton TL 12 destroyer (an attempt thwarted by the
lack of a proper jump drive chart mentioned above), I found myself
frequently flipping back and forth between pages to find the proper 
chart or instructions.  While the actual work involved in putting the
ship together was much less than with FF&S, the constant page flipping
was very annoying.  Were I to use this system on a regular basis, I
would end up photocopying the entire section and redoing the layout so
that it was in a more logical sequence.  Those responsible for the
actual layout of this section (who now will never admit it in public) should
be ceremonially flogged with a piece of wet spaghetti.

   Well that\'s what I\'ve found on the first run through.  If anybody else
has any errata they have found (particularly in the charts), please post
it here.  If someone at IG would like to respond to what I\'ve found so far,
I\'m sure everyone would like to hear it.

Regards,

Harold

        Relationships (i.e. oaths of fealty or allegiance) between Emperor
and nobles; relationships between political entities and nobility (landed
nobles with real power vs. titular nobles but no formal planetary
governmental position or holdings), rules of primogeniture (can a title be
inherited? Who gets it -- eldest son/offspring? legitimate or illegitimate?
and does the title include the lands? Must emperor or Moot confirm heir?);
Status of non-Imperial nobility (i.e. local titles) with respect to the
Imperium; who grants titles (higher titles from Emperor only; barons, etc.
may create own knights, etc.). Ability of emperor to strip titles for cause.

>2. The Empire rules the spaces between the worlds; worlds retain their own
>sovereignty, but declare allegiance to the Empire.

        Obligations of worlds to Imperium -- taxation? Extrality of
starports? Bodies for Imperial military? Land & support for bases? Ability
of Imperium to interfere in planetary affairs (Imperial Rules of War, for
example)? Limits on planetary military forces (to prevent rebellion --
perhaps no or limited jump capable warships, for example). Integrating
planetary forces into Imperial in time of war or crisis (general guideline
only, not detailed laws! Those left to bureaucrats or legislators).

>3. Free trade.

        Definition of free trade and who regulates. For example, systems
can\'t tax or interfere with shipments passing through to a third system, as
long as they\'re sealed or something. Then the planet New Salt Lake can\'t
hassle a trader who jumps in with a hold full of beer from the system Neu
Bayern, refuels and jumps to the system DryThroat. Even if the trader stops
on Salt Lake, as long as the beer remains in the hold. Different levels of
trade regulation (planets can control only at the interface between starport
and world, multiworld nobles can control trade into/out of their fief,
Imperium sets overall rules, etc.). Directs creation of imperial body
(Imperial Starport Authority or the like) to administrate extraterritorial
portion of starport, ensure consistent regulation, etc.

>4. Adoption of the Imperial calendar.
>
>5. A hereditary emperor.

        Spell out power of Emperor, even if unlimited. Who is Heir Apparent?
Can emperor name own heir (yes). Any provisions for removing Emperor. Does
the Emperor\'s Consort automatically become coruler, or must the emperor
nominate and the Moot confirm her as Empress? (or him as Emperor, as the
case may be).

>6. A legislative body for the purposes of advise and consent to imperial
>actions the Moot. Membership is open to all nobles of the Imperium. A
>relatively weak body.

        Likewise power of moot. Moot approves selection of Heir. Does
emperor have power to disband or suspend moot? Moot regulates & disciplines
itself. Does the Moot pass laws in its own right, or merely submit them to
the emperor for approval?

Section on Imperial Judiciary? Crimes against the Imperium (treason,
espionage, rebellion against noble authority vs rebellion against Imperium)

Services/guarantees the Imperium makes to member worlds (i.e. defend the
borders, suppress insurrection, guarantee free trade, noninterference by
member worlds in each others affairs, adjudicate disputes between member
worlds, postal service [XBoat Service], Imperial standard of currency,
etc.). Note Imperial Charter will not address "human rights" or any
individual rights, except for the Emperor and top nobles. Obligations worlds
undertake towards Imperium and one another. MAYBE a brief statement that any
citizen has the right of petition, to take a grievance up the noble chain
seeking redress for a wrong. No guarantee any noble will agree to listen,
mind you -- just the right to take it up the chain.

Different levels of Imperial membership -- full Imperial worlds are
sovereign, own nobility or government, representation in Moot and lesser
imperial bodies. Various lower levels, used for worlds joining Imperium or
being punished for attempted rebellion. See "Mote in God\'s Eye" for an example.

Executive branch -- military, law enforcement, etc. This should be separate
from the Emperor. Emperor is head resting on three legs, unlike, e.g., US
which has three theoretically separate and coequal branches and no head.

Hey, V was a lot of fun.  A lot of issues were simplified or ignored for the 
average TV viewer, but it was an enjoyable miniseries.  My only beef was 
motivation;  "you idiots flew past the asteroid belt and two gas gaints 
surrounded by icy moons to get WATER?"

As for the SciFi channel, for every hour of something good (V, extended version 
of Dune, The Prisoner) you get two or three hours of poorly-produced garbage 
(SciFi Buzz), infomercials for overpriced SciFi merchandise, or repeats of 
really bad 60s and 70s TV series (Incredible Hulk, Incredible Hulk, Earth 2, 
Incredible Hulk, The New Dark Shadows, Incredible Hulk, Lost in Space, 
Incredible Hulk).  It is nowhere near as cool as I hoped it would be, but its 
better than nothing.

I wish _I_ had T4 already.

I can see uses for that way of looking at it.  I\'m amenable to going with

Okay, and if you do that then you\'re either going to need lots o\' six 
siders for skill rolls, various dice (ie, simple = 2D4, Average=2D6, 
Difficult=2D8, Formidable=2D10, etc. - or 3D each time, or whatever works 
with the Skill Asset values we\'ll be working with), or you could divide 
the Skill Asset by a value for each difficulty level, such as:

Task Level    Divide By

Simple           1
Routine          2
Difficult        3
...etc. (or something like that...this is off the top of my head.)

	I\'m just throwing ideas out here, by the way, trying to get as 
many ideas on the table as possible.

T4\'s sixth attribute is Social Standing.  Charisma is a Skill Cluster,

It was my first one, too.  But not my last. :)  I\'m going to sign up for 
the Early Bird Registration as soon as the organizers get back from 
vacation, next Monday.

Carole (my wife) and I were struck by the number of gaming fanatics, 
too.  I expected a lot, but expecting and seeing are two different 
things. :)  

It was great to talk to so many people, all of whom share our passion 
for games.  That common bond of being passionate about something that 
most people know nothing about (and many have negative opinions of, 
formed in ignoranced based on media portrayals) is great to experience en 
masse like that.

Carole and I went to a greasy spoon one block away the first time we ate 
lunch there, but didn\'t go back as the food was pretty crummy.  Dinner 
Friday and Saturday was eaten at a tavern (whose name escapes me right 
now, d*mn it) that had great food and drinks.  It was just one block up 
and one building over from MECCA.  Definitely worth the walk.

I agree that the food served in MECCA was rather sub-par, and very 
overpriced.  But, that\'s what I expected.

Don\'t forget to mention that the floor was often filled with sleeping 
people. :)  Carole told me that one woman was asleep in the women\'s 
bathroom when she went in there early in the morning, and that woman was 
still sleeping there a couple of hours later. :)  I haven\'t seen 
behavior like that at the dratted business-related conventions I have to 
attend.  It was great to see people so relaxed and comfortable with 
themselves and their surroundings.

Drat.  If you wanted Imperium, you should have gone to the auction.  I 
saw no less than three copies of it there.

[cough]  Uh...okay, I\'ll admit that I bought almost all the Traveller 
miniatures RAFM had for sale on Saturday morning.  On Monday I called 
them and ordered dozens more.  I\'m glad you didn\'t have any money by the 
time you got around to RAFM. :)

I liked the Joe Martin booth. He signed a copy of his comic book for 
Carole, who is a big fan of his.  He was quite friendly, and talked with 
us for quite some time.  Sadly, his booth seemed to be doing little 
business.  I felt a bit sorry for him.

Drat, I wish you would have introduced yourself.  While no one wants a 
steady progression of people interrupting the game, I was saddened that I 
only met a very few TMLers at Gen-Con.  I wish we would have had the 
chance to meet.


> All in all a great time was had by me.

Us, too.

> By the way, never smile at a Klingon unless you mean it.

Heh.  While I was scouting out the number of people camped outside of the 
room where MST3K was to be, Carole saw something interesting.  A woman 
who looked to have just had a baby, walked up to a guy dressed (very 
convincingly, by the way) as a Klingon.  She spoke to him, and handed him 
her almost newborn baby.  She then backed up, took some pictures, then 
talked to him some more, thanking him.  Then she left.

Here\'s a person who put her newborn in a stranger\'s hands.  With the 
stories of modern life, one begins to doubt such things happen.  It seems 
to be just too dangerous to trust a stranger.  Yet, it happened.  Perhaps 
it was that the mother was too dumb to know the risk she may have been 
taking.  Or, perhaps it was that gamers\' bond at work...

I\'ve thought about doing that, but I wondered what IG would think about 
it.  

Essentially, it is the T4 combat system, with the addition of scale 
movement, and the subtraction of every defense and offense other than 
lasers, missiles, sandcasters, and armor.

I wish _I_ had bought 20 or 30 copies of T4 at Gen-Con.  I could be

people to discuss T4 with! :)

Honestly, I\'m waiting for everyone to get T4 almost as anxiously as the 
people who don\'t have it yet.

Rob,

The addresses of all the lists seem to have changed a little.  I\'m mailing
this to both @ns.mpgn.com and @mpgn.com, just to see if it gets through
with both addresses.

It\'s possible that the people reporting that they aren\'t getting mail or

Hmmm.  Every message I\'ve sent to xboat over the last couple of days has 
been bounced back to me from some anonymous remailing service, when it 
was sent only to xboat.  Either someone is forwarding my stuff there and 
disguising it to look like I\'m the one doing it, or something is screwy 
with the xboat list that is causing it.

Has anyone else had the anonymous remailing bounces inexplicably pop up 
lately, or am I the only one?

And if someone is doing it purposely, I wish they\'d stop.

It looks like they took Wildstar\'s text, moved the tables to the end of

This is a serious problem.  I\'m sure Wildstar will be delighted to hear

questions.  Hopefully someone can help me out.

The highest damage weapon does 7 dice, and it is the laser rifle. More 
common in my campaign would be something like the Pistol, cP003, which 
has a damage of 5 dice.

Looking at the armors available, it seems like the most common one is 
Flex, which offers 5 dice of flexible armor protection.

Under the combat rules, the number of dice of armor is subtracted from 
the number of damage dice before the roll is made.  So, if you had a 
weapon that did 3 dice of damage, and you scored a hit on a target with 
armor of 2, you\'d just roll one die.  If the armor is rigid, that is.  If 
it is flexible, you still roll only one die, but you get one point of 
damage per die of damage that the armor affects.  In this case, the 
damage would be 1D+2.

Fine and dandy.

The problem comes in when you take what appears to be a common weapon 
(the aforementioned pistol) and what appears to be a common armor type 
(Flex), and they both have ratings of 5.  Combat between similarly 
equipped characters boils down to whoever scores a hit does an automatic 
5 points of damage (one point per die of damage, all of which were 
affected by the armor, which was flexible).  Not very exciting in my 
opinion. The only variable becomes the to-hit task roll.

Am I thinking of this wrong?  Perhaps pistols and Flex armor aren\'t 
supposed to be very common in the Imperium?

There is a saying in the printing business:

I know what IG is going through -- I lived it for 20 years (that is, I

Yes, I\'ve thought of that too.  The only way that would work would be to
pre-generate as much as possible. 

Another idea I\'ve toyed with is not having 0 Skill levels.  Default skills
are .5 Skill levels:  Attribute of 8 - Skill.5=4, Skill1=8, Skill2=16, etc. 
The problem is how fast the numbers escalate.

What?  It\'s not?  We already have all that Canon stuff floating around,

There\'s that religion again!  <g> 

Folks have mentioned ships looking different several times already. What\'s
so different?  Are the new ships like the pictures on IG\'s webpage? 
Besides, ships look like whoever designs them says they look like.  If you
want ships to look like CT ships, then design ships that look like
that..and draw your own pictures. <g>

I\'ll have to think a bit on the other provisions, but the last one 
struck me right away: 
 
The whole point of the "Third Imperium" is to capitalize 
on the legitimacy of the First and Second. It makes a 
point of _not_ claiming to be new, but of being the  
heir to past glories (and past territories). It\'s proclaiming  
document will be an official-ese way of saying 
"We\'re back." 
 
The Imperial Charter is the "Warrant of Restoration."

I understand the tables and text were severely (and non-optimally)
re-arranged in order to squeeze the ship design system into the book.
Originally, the basic rulebook was _not_ going to have any type of starship
design system at all.  Since it was a late addition, QSDS had to fit into
the available space, and usability suffered a bit as a result.

Maybe it got lost in the shuffle, or else it is hiding in a non-obvious
place.  It should be labelled "Jump Drive Potential Table", and look like
this:

Jump Drive Potential

Jump	1	2	3	4	5	6
Hull
100	2	3	4	5	6	7
200	4	6	8	10	12	14
300	6	9	12	15	18	21
400	8	12	16	20	24	28
500	10	15	20	25	30	35
600	12	18	24	30	36	42
700	14	21	28	35	42	49
800	16	24	32	40	48	56
900	18	27	36	45	54	63
1000	20	30	40	50	60	70
2000	40	60	80	100	120	140
3000	60	90	120	150	180	210
4000	80	120	160	200	240	280
5000	100	150	200	250	300	350
						
"Jump" is the jump number desired; "Hull" is the total hull displacement, in
standard tons.  The number in the body of the table is the size of the drive
required (also in standard tons).

Jump	1	2	3	4	5	6
Fuel	10%	20%	30%	40%	50%	60%

The above table gives the jump fuel requirement, as a percentage of the
total ship volume, by jump number.

Jump Drive Technology
TL	9	11	12	13	14	15
Jump	1	2	3	4	5	6

In case it is also missing, here is the jump drive technology table.  It
gives the maximum jump capacity by tech level.

What it\'s saying is that the _launcher_ (that is, the weapon mount that
actually fires the missiles) doesn\'t need any crewmembers.  BUT, the weapon
_battery_ that the mount is a part of _does_.  That crewperson sits at a
workstation connected to the battery\'s Master Fire Director, and runs the
whole battery (in this case, fires the missiles, and directs them to their
target).

The original crew rule (which, I assume, became a part of Step 9), was:

  "Gunnery Crew:  One gunner is required for each battery installed. One gunner
  is also required for each sandcaster and damper turret installed.  Each
  gunner requires a workstation."

> For missile batteries, is this gunner in addition to the one
> required for the MFD?  The two statements seem to contradict each
> other.

No.  The manning requirements are per _battery_ (MFD), not
per _mount_ (launcher).

So what\'s the distinction between a battery and a mount?  A mount is the
physical weapon installed on the ship.  A battery is a group of one or more
weapons mounts that are controlled from a central location.  The gizmo that
does this controlling is a Master Fire Director.

In the QSDS, you generally buy weapons systems by the _battery_, and not the
mount.  A Military Laser Battery may be several weapons mounts, and the
Master Fire Director that controls them.  No matter how many mounts in the
battery, you only need one crewmember to run it.  A Civilian Laser Battery
doesn\'t have a Master Fire Director, and so it is a one-mount "battery" that
is fired under local control.

An exception to this is missile launchers.  You buy the launchers by the
mount, and then install as many Master Fire Directors as you think you need
to run the missiles, and it\'s those directors that need crew.  The other
exceptions are sandcasters and damper turrets, neither of which are grouped
into batteries at all (and both of which require one crewmember per mount).

One item that the QSDS rules don\'t mention: local control.  All of the
weapons batteries are capable of local control.  If the Master Fire Director
is knocked out, turrets from the damaged battery can fire under local
control, if a workstation was provided and is crewed.  For this reason,
military ships _may_ want to install extra gunner workstations and allocate
spare gunnery crew.

> No where have I been able to find any mention of the *cost* or
> *displacement* of spare missiles, which presumably you will need after you

Missiles displace a half of a displacement ton (seven cubic meters) and are
pretty darn heavy, too.   The cost of the missile depends on what _kind_ it
is (both the guidance system and the warhead will vary the cost of the
missile greatly).  These should be covered somewhere else in the book (like
the equipment section)?

For all intents and purposes, missile turrets aren\'t reloadable in combat (if
you want to keep track of it, it takes about an hour for a team of two to
reload a single missile - and only one team can work on a single turret or
barbette at a time).  There isn\'t an official auto-loader for missile
turrets at this time, but I\'m hoping to get one added during the FF&S II
discussions.

> Step 7, Small Craft External Grapples are described, Small Craft Hangars
> and Launch Ports (table for which is on page 112) are not.

A hangar is a hangar, y\'know.  A place to keep your small craft, kind of
like a garage.  Minimal hangars don\'t provide space for working on the
craft; there\'s no room to work.  Standard hangars are like most people\'s
garages, and there\'s room enough to get around the craft and do
maintainance.

A launch port is the hole in the side of the hull that you use to get in and
out of the hangar.  Sort of like a garage door, come to think of it.

I didn\'t really provide any explanatory text for any of these items.  The
shops, labs, and sickbays were controversial, so there weren\'t (and aren\'t)
any rules for their use.  My own rule of thumb is that the shops, labs, and
sickbays are "units" suitable for a single senior person and their
assistants.  If you have two researchers to support, install two labs; if
you have six fighter maintaiance teams, install six shops.

Fuel purificaion plants turn raw fuel (scooped from gas giants, or water
collected from any number of sources) into pure liquid hydrogen suitable for
the ship\'s power plant and fusion reactor (both of which are very
tempermental when it comes to impurities in their fuel - referees should
feel free to increase the changes of a breakdown or misjump when a ship is
running from raw fuel, either because there is no purifier, or because it\'s
broken).

Not my fault.  IG moved things around to get them to fit (on the other hand,
IG _should_ have fixed up the text to reflect where they moved things TO).

I believe the controls (both civilian and military) do not require any crew.
The tables I submitted to Imperium Games included a crew column on both,
which was a uniformly zero; I suggedted that IG eliminate the column in
editing.

That\'s mainly due to space limitations.  For the same reason, the table
published in the book only concerns itself with TL-10 hulls.  There is a BIG
table of hulls on my Web site, which presents every hull in every size
(100-1000 by 100\'s, and 1000-5000 by 1000\'s) and every configuration for
each of the significant tech level steps from 9 to 14.  You can download and
print it if you\'d like; expect to print 56 pages of hull tables.  The
address is:  http://www.qrc.com/~wildstar/qsds/

This address is also the QSDS support site; assuming that I get permission
from Imperium Games, errata and re-formatted and otherwise-improved versions
of QSDS will appear here, as well as a design archive (all this pending IG
approval, of course).

Yes ... again, was a question of space and time.  Even if space were
available, a small craft system would have challenged some of the
simplifying assumptions that I made when designing QSDS.  As it was, I
barely finished the system in time to be included in the book; attempting to
make it handle small craft as well would quite possibly made it miss.

You _will_ be able to do small craft; I believe Dave Goldens
only-slightly-more-complex Standard Ship Design System (SSDS) will allow you
to do that.  SSDS is slated to appear in the Starships suppliemnt (right,
Dave?).

Remember, T:TNE _didn\'t_ have a ship design system in the main rulebook.  T4
was almost the same; and most of the layout problems can be attributed to
squeezing QSDS into the available space.

Again, pending the permission of IG, you\'ll be able to download a
much-better-organized version of the system from my Web site.

Suggestion 2: According to Survival Margin, Cleon said "Any sentient life
form within the Imperial Borders, regardless of its origin, is a protected
being, and thus a citizen of the Imperium."  There you have a definition of
citizenship and some kind of vague protection for sentients all in one
sentence (and from a canon source to boot).  One of these protections, found
in the High Justice article in JTAS 14, is that the capture, transportation,
and possession of slaves is prohibited.

In terms of flowery preambles, I would suggest that any preamble for 
the initial written act of the Imperium is going to draw heavily on 
the at that time mainly legendary history of the 1st & particularly 2nd Empires... 
 If I recall earlier writings on the subject... Cleon and family even 
drew back a rather tenuous line of succession to 1 of the last 
Emperors of the Rule of Man...so they will want to create this myth 
with the 1st proclamation...  They might spend as much verbage on this 
portion of the document as that which follows it...

> 1. It established the Empire, which is defined as governmental unit ruled by
> an Emperor over subordinate governments such as principalities, baronies,
> kingdoms, etc.

Concept of nobility, loyalty to higher nobles, and loyalty by 
nobility to their subjects...  Nobility Obligates...  

Advancement through service to higher cause and higher authority, 
would be a great central theme...

> 2. The Empire rules the spaces between the worlds; worlds retain their own
> sovereignty, but declare allegiance to the Empire.

A few thoughts.  Would Cleon have touched on the following issues in 
this document:  

Imperial Rules of War (an obvious exception to the 
space between the worlds limits on sovereignty...)

Exceptions to local sovereignty, and establishment of an outline for 
enforcement mechanisms:  Armed Forces, Ministry of Justice, etc...

What defines an Imperial Citizen for purposes of 
protection under Imperial law...

> 3. Free trade.

Establishment of the Ministry of Trade & OCC to ensure compliance 
with these principles???

Creation of the concept of Imperial Charters...

Sales pitch on the benefits of an enlightened free trade policy for all...

> 4. Adoption of the Imperial calendar.
> 
> 5. A hereditary emperor.

I\'m sure that the nomination of Cleon by the Moot will be played up 
to again help generate the creation myth...

> 6. A legislative body for the purposes of advise and consent to imperial
> actions the Moot. Membership is open to all nobles of the Imperium. A
> relatively weak body.

I\'ve always viewed the Moot as kind of an interstellar UN, an 
ineffectual debating society.  The whole was not as powerful as the 
sum of its parts...  The power of smaller groups of high ranking nobles are 
in the final analysis, more important than those of the Moot...  If 
you think about it, the few times when the Moot might have actually 
been able to exercise its authority most, if it were effective, were the times 
when it didn\'t work...  The Civil War & The Rebellion...  

Even in the times of the Barracks Emperors, it wasn\'t really all that effective.  
Over half of the Barracks Emperors crowned themselves Emperor.  For 
those who were approved by the Moot, this approval added little 
or no legitimacy to their claim, and since they got their necks 
chopped anyways, the Moot seal of approval wound up being 
meaningless...  This didn\'t really stop until after Arbellatra 
decided not to crown herself Empress, acted as de facto regent until 
such time as it was obvious to the Moot that anybody with even 
remotely legitimate claim to the throne was DEAD, so they crowned her 
Empress instead... 

Yes, I know, the Moot got rid of Cleon the Mad, but this is really 
Cassius & Brutus ridding the world of Caesar...  It wasn\'t the Moot 
as an organ nearly as much as it was a group of nobles (archdukes?) 
who saw it to be in the best interest of the Imperium to let Cleon fall 
on a knife 40 times...

The Moot\'s biggest power might be withholding approval of an act of 
an Emperor, or the nomination of an Emperor or noble...  If Imperial 
history is any barometer...  Approval of the Moot didn\'t mean 
anything in cases where there was more than 1 claimant to the 
throne...

> Assuming this document is less than 1,000 words, what would it say?

A few sections that might be worthwhile additions to the initial 
document:  

Symbology (Imperial Sun Banner)

Responsibilities by member worlds to the Imperium...

> What other provisions would it have. 

It would definitely not have provisions for succession in cases where 
there was no issue...  Most periods of turmoil in Imperial history 
were the result of situations where there was no direct heir to the 
throne...   

>What would be the loopholes? 

I think the role of the Archdukes should be left very ambiguous...  
They were probably the 1 truly effective check on an overambitious 
Emperor, at least prior to the Civil War, when the offices were 
dissolved...  They clearly have powers over their particular domains that 
would almost rival the Emperor.  Don\'t underestimate their power.  The 
Archdukes removed Cleon II...  They murdered Cleon the Mad (establishing 
the right of assassination as a means of ascending the throne, and they 
started/spread the Civil War, finally, Strephon cut his own throat by 
recreating the Archducal Domains, and 1 of his Archdukes thanked him 
for it by pumping his clone full of bullets...  While the Moot might 
steal a lot of the publicity for being a legislative/advising body to 
the Emperor, the real "Powers behind the Throne" are the archdukes in 
the early days...in fact I suspect that the original archdukes might 
be the partners in Cleon\'s group of  conglomerates...

>What is its name?

I think an ideal document would have a preamble which traces the 
legitimacy of the Zhunastu name, in some way, back to the Rule of 
Man...even if it is pure myth (which it will most likely be...)

Therefore my idea of a name for this document is:

Proclamation of the Restoration of the Grand Imperium of the Stars 
and the Rule of Man

...better known as the Restoration Proclamation, or the Act of Year 
Zero... for short...

Well, judging from the law-types I\'ve seen de-lurk from time to time, I\'d 
almost bet you a dime that you\'ll get something resembling a polished 
document that\'ll look a lot like the Real Thing would.  Nice hook, BTW.

I suspect that it\'ll be precedent, rather than any explicit declaration 
in the constitution, that governs this.  Remember the Right of 
Assassination, and how it worked during one time, but failed miserably 
another?

Sure. Here\'s a quick & dirty QBASIC program I threw together to
generate them (note that I started with 3.5, and commented out loops to
get the lesser results)

DIM roll(25)
\'FOR a = 1 TO 6
  \'FOR b = 1 TO 6
    FOR c = 1 TO 6
      FOR d = 1 TO 3
        roll(a + b + c + d) = roll(a + b + c + d) + 1
      NEXT d
    NEXT c
  \'NEXT b
\'NEXT a

FOR a = 1 TO 25
  sum = sum + roll(a)
NEXT a

OPEN "1.5" FOR OUTPUT AS 1
FOR a = 1 TO 25
  IF roll(a) > 0 THEN PRINT #1, a, roll(a), roll(a) / sum
NEXT a
CLOSE

And now for the results:

Yep. It came out a few years back.

Both! Heinlein\'s contract with the publisher of that and several other
books wouldn\'t *let* a revised version be published while he was alive.
So he wrote up the revisions, and handed them to his wife to be
published once he was dead (at which point all rights in the books
reverted back to his estate).

There\'s also a revised version of "Red Planet". And the current version
of "Podkayne of Mars has *both* the original ending and the one the
publisher made him change it to (in the original Poddy *doesn\'t*
survive!). The readers get to vote as to which ending will be used in
all future editions.

And of course, there\'s the revised edition of Stranger in a Strange
Land. They wanted him to shorten it, and the only way to do it
withoutleaving gaping holes was to trim a sentence here, a word there,
rephrase this, etc. He was *not* cutting "fluff"! I\'d say you should at
least *read* the new edition, preferrably with the old one handy.
You\'ll be reading along and suddenly go "wait a sec". Then you have to
compare the two to find the *tiny* change. :-)

Still, there were a few scenes that were trimmed a bit and the longer,
more detailed version does explain things better (like *why* Ben Caxton
left in such a hurry)

> Tell you what, I\'m sure enjoying the reruns of "V" on the Sci-Fi channel!

Only as long as you ignore the reason *why* they want to take over.

Without going further into the matter (as i am not arguing either side of
the issue here), there is one thing you may not have considered under
either an attribute or skill-based system in your astrogation example.

After 12 years\' experience you are _certainly_ much, much more than 30 per
cent better than when you first stepped onto the bridge of a vessel, as it
is highly unlikely that Astrogation is a default skill.  Thus, you
previously had _no_ chance whatsoever to improve.  [grin]

And then there are physical skills:  I may have been honing my basketball
expertise for 12 years now (I haven\'t), but I am still just 5\'10 with
pretty unimpressive hand-eye co-ordination.  30 per cent would be
meaningful in relation to my overall ability to hit a shot, but would
likely not impress some kid, 6\'6 and jumps like Michael Jordan, who has
only being playing for a year.

I make absolutely no claims as to the relevancy of this last statement...  [g]

Actually, there should be no provision for ousting emperors.  For one,
this document, which is necessarily public, is going to get more
scrutiny than any other document of its era.  Many people would have an
interest in ousting Cleon or any other emperor.  You have to project the
image that the emperor is benign, upstanding, comes from the right
bloodline, and is invincible.  Secondly, Cleon the Mad\'s cabinet
supposedly had to debate long and hard about whether and how to get rid
of him and get away with it.  Porfiria drew the short straw and got to
take the big risk of assasinating him (IIRC, she shot him as he entered
the cabinet chambers).  Because the Moot was as glad to be rid of him as
the cabinet, she was crowned empress for her crime, rather than being
hanged.  This action established the only known precedent for
non-voluntary succession, the Right of Assasination.  Until Cleon the
Mad, the emperor had to die or abdicate for a change in leadership. 
Fortunately for the Third Imperium, that Right remained unexercised for
several centuries thereafter.  Unfortunately, it also directly led (will

Time for a little logrolling.  As I stated before, there should definitely be no 
mention or provision for removal of a HEREDITARY emperor, competent 
or not...  Certainly, Cleon is not going to write a document that 
advocated the assumption of the throne by "right of Assassination" in 
such a document, which is the ONLY way in Imperial history that an 
Emperor/Empress was removed from office other than death by natural 
causes, or the occasional abdication...  He might as well paint a 
target on himself saying "Shoot me!"...

Pete,

I agree with you.  Equipment lists, skill lists, etc. shouldn\'t be on the 
GM screen.  Penetration values and weapon damage is an iffy thing, 
though, because while the PC sheets should have this information already 
given on them, the NPC\'s (esp. on-the-spot ones) oftentimes won\'t.  

I\'d like to see the task system table, the basic combat charts, encounter 
charts (spaceship and patron, not animal), and starship combat charts 
covered.  Hmmm.  Can\'t think of anything else right now.

I\'ll have to make some more characters before I know for sure, but the 
first three characters I\'ve generated have surprised me by not needing 
space for more then the 17 skills the basic T4 chracter sheet allows 
for.  So, I\'m not so sure my previous complaints about there not being

   It is MIA.  Thanks for the info--now I can finish that destroyer.

   As a matter of fact it was also missing, still another piece of errata
I\'m afraid.  Thanks for posting it.

   The problem is that missile launchers and laser weaponry are treated
differently in the book.  While laser weaponry is preorganized into
batteries (sometimes consisting of just one weapon), missile launchers
come in two types: turrets or barbettes.  There is no discussion of
organizing launchers into batteries, only how many missiles can be
controlled by a MFD.

   A clarification statement of some kind should handle the problem.

>No.  The manning requirements are per _battery_ (MFD), not
>per _mount_ (launcher).

   At higher tech levels, it is possible to have multiple missile turrets
organized into seperate batteries under a single MFD (this is generally
not an issue at TL 12 or below, because MFD control factors aren\'t 
usually high enough).  Thus, MFD and missile battery are not necessarily
synonymous, and thus the source of the confusion.

   Also--I\'ve designed several ships using FF&S, so I\'m familar with how
things work under that system.  What I\'m attempting to do here is
approach things as though I know nothing about FF&S, and I\'m picking
up T4 with no prior knowledge (just as a new player would).

   Standard FF&S missiles displace 7 cubic meters and weigh 7 tons--
that fact is not stated in T4 however, though it certainly should be,
as should the time it takes to reload missile launchers.  I\'m afraid we\'re
back to the classic T pre-Special Missile Supplement rules, where
missiles are much less powerful, but you never have to worry about
reloads or running out of them.

>A hangar is a hangar, y\'know.  A place to keep your small craft, kind of

   As I stated above, I\'m familar with the concepts, but someone picking
up the book with no prior knowledge of TNE might not understand the
difference.  The difference may be explained elsewhere, but I couldn\'t
find it on my first run through.

>I didn\'t really provide any explanatory text for any of these items.  The

   How could shops, labs, and sickbays be controversial?  and if you\'ve
gone to all the trouble of putting them in the game, why wouldn\'t you
include a description of them?  I\'m not accusing you personally of
anything, I just don\'t understand IG\'s logic.

>Fuel purificaion plants turn raw fuel <snip>

   This is the explanation that a newbie needs, and it should have been
included, but wasn\'t.

   Absolutely.  If you are going to the trouble of including a *very* basic
ship design sequence, then you owe it to your public to make sure that
everything is spelled out as clearly and concisely as possible, and that
it all works as seamlessly and effortlessly as possible.  Afterall, you\'re
trying to *encourage* non-gearheads to design a ship, not discourage
them.

   Well the columns were definately there.  On the SCC, at TL 9: 3.0 crew
are required, at TL 10: 3.0, at TL 11: 2.0, at TL 12: 2.0, at TL 13: 2.0, at
TL 14: 1.0 and at TL 15: 1.0 are required.

   Interesting, as the chart does not indicate that all the hulls are from
one universal tech level, though that would certainly make sense in
retrospect.

  Time for a *minor* correction on my TL 12 destroyer\'s hull....

>As it was, I barely finished the system in time to be included in the book;

   Then it was probably a good thing that you left it out.  Better a limited
system that can be expanded later than a total diaster unsuitable for
use by sane people (i.e. MegaErrata ship design).

   True enough, we get a slightly simplified TNE system in Brilliant Lances
(not included with the TNE manual), and then the full blown system in
FF&S (which you could purchase seperately or with the TNE manual as
part of the boxed set).  I beg to differ on the space problems though--
there appears to be more than adequate space available in the section
so that the tables could have been layed out in a more logical format.
Also, someone decided that inserting three full pages sketches that
have nothing to do what-so-ever with ship design in the ship design
section was a good idea--for future reference to whom it may concern,
it was not.  Neither was putting six pages of ship design examples
and illustrations between the ship design instructions and the tables
you need to carry out the instructions.  While having the examples
close at hand in the book was OK, they should have been put at the
end or the beginning of the ship design section so that you don\'t have to
flip past them as you go back and forth looking up information for your
designs.

>Again, pending the permission of IG, you\'ll be able to download a
>much-better-organized version of the system from my Web site.

   I look forward to it.

>Remember, I don\'t work (or speak) for IG; I just wrote the system ...

   Nearly as good  (and in some cases better).

   For the record, I\'m not trying to trash IG here or the new ship design
sequence.  I\'m merely trying to point out where the problems are, so
that they can be fixed.  I want everyone to be able to use this system
so that they don\'t feel like they have to fall back on Book 2 or High Guard
or some other such thing, or worse still, not design a ship at all.  One of
the things I appreciated most about TNE was that GDW was very open
and upfront about where mistakes were made, and they were 
generally quick to fix them (and no smart ass remarks about Virus being
a mistake they didn\'t fix, OK?).  Hopefully IG will continue this tradition.

Harold

I\'m not too sure what else would be in there, apart from vague 
handwavings about the rights of sophonts and the supremacy of the 
Imperium over its subjects and dominions. It seems likely to me that 
much of what we see as the laws and ordinances of the Imperium could 
well have evolved over the years. As an example, the Moot could have 
been introduced as a method to give some powers to nobles, which the 
Emperor needed to keep on his side.

In any case, from what does the authority of the Imperium derive, if 
not the strength of Cleon\'s (or the current emperor\'s) fleets? In 
that case, a constitution describing the components of the Imperium 
probably isn\'t necessary.

Having used a similar system for task resolution to T4 for many years (in
my own RPG System, code name RP3)... It is actually VERY simple to do
progressive difficulties, although slow.

Have the player roll a minimum # of dice (I\'d say 2), all d6\'s
then have them add 1 more die, and see if as a d3 it succeeds, then instead
(Without rerolling) as a d6. repeat until failure. number of dice
successfully under asset is level of success.

 Imperium and the member worlds, shall be the Imperial Credit.
 The Imperial Credit shall be valued independently of the value
 of any coin, currency, or value of any member world.  The
 Imperium shall have the responsibility and power to control the
 value of the Imperial Credit.

 The Imperium shall use as its standard of measurement the
 presently accepted standard measures and nomenclature used by
 the Sylean Federation.  These standards shall be designated the
 Standard Imperial Measurement System (SI).

 {Here ends the matters that Marc specifically mentioned in his
 post.  The rest (and some of the above) is all "etc."}

 Article VI

 Chattel slavery shall not exist in the Imperium, nor on its
 member worlds, nor on any world with which a member world shall
 have dealings.

 Article VII

 The governance and operation of starports is reserved to the
 Imperium.  Movement of material and sophonts between the
 starport and the member world shall be controlled by the member
 world, subject to Imperial laws governing such movement.  The
 territory of a starport shall be excluded from the jurisdiction
 of the member world, and no material or sophonts shall enter
 the starport area from the member world without the express
 consent of the starport operating authority.

 [Deleted]

 Herewith my proposed Imperial Charter (my personal notes are in
 {} braces):
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
 Preamble - Proclamation of the Imperium

 We, Cleon Zhunastu, recognizing that the present structure
 governing the Sylean Federation is inadequate for governance of
 a necessarily expanded entity, and with the acquiescence of the
 present Government of the Sylean Federation, declare that the
 Sylean Federation has outlived its usefulness, and is
 dissolved.  We further proclaim that the worlds formerly of the
 Sylean Federation shall be members of a new entity, to be
 referred to henceforth as "the Imperium".  We further proclaim
 that we, Cleon Zhunastu, are assuming Imperial power for the
 period necessary to ensure a stable and enduring Imperium.

 Article I - Imperial Governance, Membership, Citizenship

 The Imperium shall exercise no direct governance over any
 member world.  Instead, the purpose of the Imperium shall be to
 provide for the defense of all of the member worlds as a group,
 and to bring the rule of law to the spaces between worlds.

 A world shall be defined as a body of planetary size that is
 populated.  Included in this definition shall be planetoid
 belts, defined as a region of space around a central star to
 which the component planetoids are gravitationally bound, such
 that not less than two-thirds of the planetoids so bound shall
 have not less than two-thirds of their respective orbits within
 that region.

 Any world may, through a recognized representative, proclaim
 allegiance to the Imperium, and in so doing, such world shall
 become a member of the Imperium, equal in status to all other
 members of the Imperium.  Member worlds shall govern themselves
 as they see proper, provided that such government does not
 violate Imperial laws.

 The exclusive jurisdiction of a member world shall extend to
 100 (one hundred) times the diameter of the member world,
 measured from the center of mass of the world.  The exclusive
 jurisdiction of a member world that is a planetoid belt shall
 extend throughout the region that defines the member world, and
 to all planetary bodies or planetoids that traverse that
 region, and to 100 diameters of such planetary bodies
 or planetoids or 1000 miles, whichever is greater, measured from
 the center of mass of the planetary body or planetoid.

 A member world that is the sole member world in its stellar
 system, and which has the technological capability and
 sufficient personnel to enforce its laws throughout the system,
 may, upon proper notification to and acceptance by the
 Imperium, exercise exclusive jurisdiction throughout the
 stellar system.  If a second world shall apply for membership
 in the Imperium from such system, the first member world shall
 have the right to veto such membership.

 The Imperium reserves to itself the power to create as it sees
 fit governmental entities superior to the member worlds but
 subordinate to the Imperium.

 The Imperium reserves to itself the power to create as it sees
 fit bureaus and agencies to carry out and enforce the Imperial
 will.

 The Imperium considers as citizens any sophont native to or
 naturalized by a member world of the Imperium.

 A world governed by a member world is not itself a member
 world, but is considered to be part of the member world, and
 all inhabitants thereof are considered to have the same rights,
 protections, and obligations under Imperial law as the
 inhabitants of the member world.

 Article II - The Emperor, Hereditary Succession

 The Powers of the Imperium shall be vested in an Emperor, who
 shall maintain that title and those powers until his death or
 voluntary abdication.  Upon such death or abdication, the title
 and powers shall pass to the oldest child of the Emperor,
 provided that the child shall have been publicly acknowledged
 as the Emperor\'s by the Emperor, and providing that there are
 no conditions which would disqualify the child as fit to
 maintain the Powers of the Imperium.

 Article III - The Moot, Nobility

Thanks Shadow, but this *is* what I meant by brute force.  I did the same

without our computers?  <g> 

Actually, *that* was what I meant, how *would* we do it if we didn\'t have
the computer to do it by brute force?

Years ago, when Traveller was new and a calculator was the
closest thing to a computer I had access to, I figured 2d6, 2d8, 3d6, and a
few others by hand using the same basic algorithim.  I said then and say
now, "There *ought* to be a better, a smarter way!" <g>

Let\'s see...you both start off with equal strength and agility, you\'ve been
working hard for 12 years, he\'s just picked up the ball. HEIGHT is
something else!  Traveller has never really taking SIZE into account.  But
let\'s try it anyway...

The kid could probably post you up the inside, but with 12 years of
experience you would know how to block him out so he wouldn\'t get *easy*
shots or rebounds.  From the outside you should be able to cover him pretty
well, and frankly steal him blind if he tries to drive to the basket. 
Offensively, you\'d have to depend on fakes and quickness to get open shots
and layups.  I think you\'d have a good chance...sort of like Muggsy Boggs,
in his prime, going up against Michael Jordan as a high school junior.

To make the analogy more fair, let\'s put MJ up against the high school kid
that was just drafted in the first round.  They are both about the same
size, and probably pretty close to the same *natural* ability.  I\'d even
say MJ has lost a point or two of his *natural* ability from aging, but my
expectation would be that MJ would shut the kid down and score at will. <g>

Would MJ be 36% better than whats-his-name?  More?  Less?  I guess that\'s
just subjective.

>...definitely NOT like Mike!

...but wouldn\'t it be nice. <g>

Eris

ps.  I\'m not knocking the kid, I just don\'t remember his name, and I\'m sure
he\'ll be a very good player...eventually, maybe even as good as MJ, but
just not his first year.

I would suspect the document in question would NOT be any form of laws or 
anything, beyond a simple statement of rights and responsibilities.  I think it 
would be more along the lines of the US Constitution and Bill of Rights; a 
foundation for real laws to be built upon.  In the US Constitution, there is 
really only one law and crime specified; treason.  The rest are enumerated in 
the Bill of Rights and subsequent amendments.   

I would picture a flowery preamble, and a discussion of the intent of the 
Imperium; why is it being created, what is the goal and how it fits into an 
overall historical trend leading to this point.  I would follow that with an 
overview on the organization of the Imperium; the hereditary nobility etc.  I 
think it would outline a structure that is different from the 1200 model; there 
would not be any mention of Archdukes and Domains.  These would be added later 
when the Imperium grows.  At first, the document would only address the 
nobility structure at the subsector/sector level, and how lower-ranking nobles 
would rule/reign/represent smaller entities such as star systems and worlds.

For the end of the document, I would include something called The Twleve 
Precepts.  Like the 10 amendments in the Bill of Rights, these Precepts are not 
truly laws in themselves, but guidelines to be followed in making laws.  Each 
Precept would be a paragraph, and like the Bill of Rights would be open and 
loose enough to be subject to interpretation.  Here\'s a suggested set of 
precepts (some of which are blatantly stolen from other posts)

The Twelve Precepts
1.  Any sentient life form within the Imperial Borders, regardless of its 
origin, is a protected
being, and thus a citizen of the Imperium.
2.  A guarantee of the internal sovereignity of Imperial member worlds, subject 
to the safety, security and well-being of the Imperium.  <BIG loophole here>
3.  A guarantee of the internal sovereignity of the thoughts and beleifs of 
Imperial citizens. 
4.  A guarantee of the right of free passage for Imperial Citizens within 
Imperial space, again subject to the safety, security and well-being of the 
Imperium.
5.  A guarantee of the right of Imperial nobles to Imperial justice, and to 
appeal to higher nobility.
6.  A guarantee of the right of all Imperial Citizens to due process, subject 
to the safety, security and well-being of the Imperium.  <BIG loophole here>
7.  A statement of the responsibility of Imperial member worlds and citizens to 
support the Imperium and its laws, by action and through taxes
8.  An acknowledgement of the power of the Emperor to mete out justice, and to 
overturn any ruling from a lower noble or court. 
9.  A statement of immunity from local laws and justice for the Emperor and the 
Imperial family
10.  A limitation of the laws of Imperial members worlds to apply to those 
worlds alone, and not to extend to Imperial space or territory.
11.  An extension of the Imperial immunity from local justice to include the 
Moot and the Imperial Household.
12.  An acknowledgement that, when a conflict exists between an Imperial law or 
decree and a law or decree from an Imperial member world or lesser noble, the 
Imperial law or decree holds precedence

As you can see, there are several loopholes here:
1.  Fairly straightforward, but define sentient
2.  "Subject to" is another way of saying "unlesss the Emperor decides 
otherwise"
3.  There is no gaurantee about the freedom to express or act on these ideas or 
beleifs.
4.  Again, "Subject to" is another way of saying "unlesss the Emperor decides 
otherwise"
5.  Since Imperial Law does not recognize many "crimes" covered in planetary 
laws, this often means Nobles can get away with many crimes, or get lesser 
punishments.  However, some crimes have greater punishments at the Imperial 
level
6.  Again, "Subject to" is another way of saying "unlesss the Emperor decides 
otherwise"
7.  Time to pay the piper.  There\'s nothing here that says "fair" or "equitable"
8.  Local laws are fine, unless the Emperor is interested.
9.  Local laws are fine, unless the Emperor is involved.
10.  Local laws are fine, unless the Emperor\'s space or property is involved.
11.   Local laws are fine, unless the Emperor\'s friends, cronies or coworkers 
are  involved
12.  Local laws are fine, unless the Imperium has a better one.

Somewhat cynical sounding, but remember that the Emperor (Cleon) is no fool, 
and understands that his power can only e used sparingly; constant interference 
in local events will wear him out, and will make him very unpopular.  Unpopular 
leaders would likely have a short lifespan.

There is that. :)

What concerned me most about the change in the way Traveller ships look 
as that, as far as figures go, I would be stuck with the new look.  
That\'s why I bought many of each figure RAFM offers. :)

Yeah, that\'s a problem with a lot of possible task systems.  Too much 
work involved.  I like the T4 system because it is so simple - esp. if 
you buy a few D3s.

Hmmm.  So we seem to have established that the system we would like to 
see would be simple and robust, while using only D6\'s.  Other than the 
D100-style reading of D6\'s, I haven\'t seen anything proposed that fits 
the bill.  And I can\'t think of anything else either.  I guess we\'ll have 
to keep at it...

mandate to make space safe for commerce.

The document should allude to the history of the First and Second Imperium if
ONLY to allow itself to draw precedent (without actually reiterating it in
the Founding Document) when needed.

Definitely, no mention should be made of methods or processes of removing the
Emperor/Emperoress from office.

My Cr2... more later.

        I thinks this document will say almost nothing about the "rights" of
individuals, concentrating rather on the rights/responsibilities of nobles
and governments. Everybody else is below the notice of the Imperium, and
just a matter for the individual worlds. If you start giving people rights,
you limit what the government can do to them. That\'s bound to cause some
governments to resist joining the Imperium. Now, you can PERHAPS limit what
one government can do to another\'s subjects, and prohibit something like the
slave trade between worlds. But an individual world will still be able to
have slavery.

        Since one of the Emperors Cleon had to enunciate this much later,
it\'s obviously not a part of the original founding document.

        OK.

        This isn\'t a 20th century democracy. Remember, the Imperium even in
1100 contains ALL kinds of governments, many of which are completely
contradictory to this. And why should the Imperium care about Joe Schmoe?

>4.  A guarantee of the right of free passage for Imperial Citizens within

        Don\'t spell this out. Assume it under the "free trade"

        This one single right (the right of any citizen to appeal to a
noble), I might see in this document.

>6.  A guarantee of the right of all Imperial Citizens to due process, subject

        Ditch this.

>7.  A statement of the responsibility of Imperial member worlds and
citizens to

        OK.

>8.  An acknowledgement of the power of the Emperor to mete out justice, and to

        Be careful how much you spell out the power of the Emperor. You
might be implicitly limiting him/her by omitting something (i.e. since it
spells out stuff he can do, and doesn\'t say he can do "X," he can\'t do "X")

>9.  A statement of immunity from local laws and justice for the Emperor and
the

        That shouldn\'t even be considered a possibility by mentioning it.
Rather just say that the Emperor is the supreme authority.

        See 9. Don\'t even admit it\'s conceivable by denying it.

        I don\'t know about anybody else, but I certainly didn\'t mean to have
the IRW themselves written into the charter. In fact, they have NEVER been
formally codified anyway. What I meant was that the Imperium should reserve
to itself the right to violate the very sovereignty of a world that it is
supposedly guaranteed, and then used IRW as an example of WHY the charter
should allow it. I agree, keep this as general as possible (so the Emperor
can stretch it as far as he/she likes).

    'body' => 'Now that I have some experience with the character generation system, I 
have a few comments:

1)  While characters do end up with a lot of skills, the use of the 
Clusters (ie, allowing the player to pick among a group of related skills 
rathan forcing one on him) makes it easier for a player to get higher 
levels of fewer skills, OR get more skills at lower levels.

2)  I can\'t figure out why character types which do not have ranks all 
have Item benefit tables that list 7 items, even though there is no way 
to roll a 7.  (At least, no way that I can find.)

3)  If your character is going to go to college, and if you are using one 
of the optional characteristic generation systems that allows it, put 
your lowest score in EDU, assuming it is 4 or greater.  As noted before, 
you get a +4 increase in EDU upon successful completion of College (+5 if 
you graduate with honors), which is a pretty easy way of getting rid of 
your lowest score.  For example, I just rolled up a character with UPP 
988947.  After going to college, the score was 988987.  Much better...

4)  Although I was skeptical of the usefulness of the Scholar character 
in a typical CT-style campaign, I just rolled one up (the aforementioned 
college graduate) and it was rather easy to work in such useful skills as 
Pistol-1 and Astrogation-3, in addition to a bunch of scholarly skills.  
The character ended up being a nice multi-dimensional character, well 
able to pursue his scholarly goals while Travelling.  He wouldn\'t be a 
drag on the average Traveller character group.  (Of course he wouldn\'t 
fit very well with a mercenary outfit...[G])

5)  The home world generation in the character generation section should 
have been replaced with a reference to the appropriate tables in the 
World Generation section.  As it is, it does not generate a UPW, so 
is of marginal usefulness IMO.  The character should certainly know more 
about his homeworld than that it was "Large," had water, etc.  

6)  I really like the Homeworld Common Skills tables.  This was a really 
good addition.

7)   This character, like the previous ones I generated, didn\'t exceed 
the 17 skills which space is provided for on the character sheet.  This 
was mostly because I wanted skill depth as well as breadth.  If a person 
wanted all skills at level 1, it would be easy to exceed 17 skills, though.

8)  Jack-of-all-Trades is still too powerful of a skill, IMO.  It allows 
characters to use any skill that it is possible to use at level-0, but 
with the J-o-t skill level plus /half/ the relevant attribute as the 
target number.  Using 1/2 attribute scores as the basis is good, but I 
still think it is too powerful a skill.  With level-0 skill usage 
available, I think J-o-t skill should be dropped.

That\'s it for now.

I agree, but how much of that is knowledge of the game (skill level) and how
much is raw talent (attribute) and how much is pure intimidation (somethin
else entirely!)?

Yeah, I\'ve got to say that I\'m coming around to this sort of 
interpretation of it as well.  Its going to be a whole lot less of a 
Code of Hammurabi, and a whole lot more a combination of general 
principles, and why you should buy Imperial, and not Terran Union...  
A rousing speech of general principles, not a focus on minutiae...

	Whats that normal would be : 10%,15%,20%,25% and so on if
	I had interpreted the FF&S rules the last years right.

	FF&S states :

	" The fuel necessary for a jump of one parsec is equal to
	  the total volume of of the jump drive machinery multiplied
	  by 5 and dividet by the drives maximum jump number. "

	While the volume of a jump drive is jump+1 percent of the
	ships displacement, the volume for a full jump would be
	(jump+1)*5 percent of the hulls displacement.

	So who is wrong ?

Actually neither is wrong...  Odd isn\'t it.  TNE with the use of HEPLAR 
has decided that a greater percentage of the ships internal volume will 
be given over to reaction mass, that is manouver fuel.

T4 on the other hand uses Grav-Thrusters, which consume a minimal amount 
of volume, and comperable power levels.  Unfortunately this means that 
without some kind of restraint T4 ships could be armed to the teeth.  The 
restraint is that the fuel necessary to put the ship into J-Space is 
enormous compared to TNE.

You know it\'s too bad a ship consumes all it\'s J-Fuel before it jumps, 
according to official documents that is, I\'ve never been one to beleive 
in the official word.  If the ships consumed it over the course of the 
just what you could do is refine enough fuel for J1, which would get you 
into J-Space, plot your J-3 course, flip the switch and refine the rest 
of the fuel in the hole.  This would greatly decrease a ships turn around 
time when doing frontier refuelings.
 
> PS : I think I\'ll stay with TNE.

I\'m not going to make any rash decisions yet, but I\'m a great fan of TNE 
and I\'m in the process of designing 3 TNE ships, perhaps I\'ll throw them 
throught the SSDS so T$ players can uses them...

The numbers you give (10%,15%,20%,25%,30%35%) are correct for T:TNE and are
the values given in Fire, Fusion, and Steel.  However, in T:TNE/FF&S, HEPlaR
is the only available thrust agency, and HEPlaR requires large quantites of
reaction fuel.  Because of this, the jump fuel required was reduced from
Classic Traveller in order to make the higher jump-number starships
possible.

In T4, Thrust Plates have been re-established as the thruster of choice.
The cost of thrust plates has been reduced, and so only ships that are
too low-tech to use Thrust Plates will wind up with HEPlaR (the lower price
of Thrust Plates makes the additional revenue from the cargo that is
carried in place of HEPlaR fuel greater than the additional cost for Thrust
Plates over HEPlaR).

Thrust Plates do not require fuel, so the Classic Traveller jump fuel usage
was restored, to keep the ship design system roughly similar, in terms of
the percentage of the ship used for drives, fuel, and other items.

> 	So who is wrong ?

Neither one. 
Use the FF&S fuel requirements with T:TNE.
Use the T4 fuel requirements with T4.


For completeness sake, I\'ll note that MegaTraveller also used the lower
jummp fuel requirements.  This was because of the enormous size and fuel
consumption of MegaTraveller power plants.

1.  Short and general, outlining basic principles and a process for
    interpreting them (the US Constitution is a good example of this,
    which is why the law school I attend has, in addition to a general
    "Constitutional Law" course, courses on specific Amendments).

    Constitution simple, interpretation complex.


2.  Lengthy, containing specific provisions for everything the founders
    could think of.  India\'s Constitution, which I am told is *over 400
    pages long*, is an example of this.

    Constitution complex, interpretation simple.


It sounds like what Marc Miller wants is the first kind of document.  If
that\'s the case, *you don\'t have to put everything in*.  Things you don\'t
include are then decided either by reference to the general principles
that are outlined in the document (and the "who decides what and how"
stuff is key here), or by incorporating existing practice.

The document, for example, doesn\'t necessarily have to tell you what
authority Nobles have.  It can say "Nobles owe fealty to the Emperor, and
are entitled to a seat in the Moot," and simply assume that aside from
those changes, Nobles retain whatever authority was granted to them by
existing law.  You can incorporate existing law explicitly ("We affirm the
Sylea Treaty of XXXX"), or implicitly.

Recap:  The critical features are:

a.  Basic Principles
b.  The process for interpretation

All else is unnecessary (though it can provide interesting color; if you
look at what was explicitly stated in our Constitution and what was left
to interpretation, it\'s entertaining).

The PDF Gunners watched their scopes as the Zhodani fleet drew near, falling
into a classic assult orbit.  In defence HQ, General Dien went over his
plans for what promised to be a desperate battle.  Suddenly, a comtech look
up in suprise.

"General, I have the Zhodani in contact, Leader of 10,000 Zhivresiebr for you."

"Put him on the speakers, son"

The sound of the contact wave was broken by the sounds of Galangic spoken

The General was out of his chair so fast he almost hit escaoe velocity;
"Imperial.. Citizens??" he asked in a voice that was so tense it squeked.

Currently, QSDS 1.4 is available only as a Microsoft Word 6.0 document.

T4 Errata that is corrected by QSDS 1.4 include:
1) The missing Jump Drive Potential table is included in QSDS 1.4
2) Rules and supporting tables are more clearly organized.

QSDS errors that are corrected by version 1.4 include:
1) HEPlaR power requirements are now correct; this is a major change (HEPLaR
   should require 140Mw per dton, not 10Mw/dton as in previous versions) and
   will require re-designs of earlier HEPLaR vessels (hopefully, not many
   designs will be affected).
2) Power plant fuel was increased to 1 year (from six months in previosly
   versions) to be compatible with the other T4 ship and vehicle design
   systems.  Ships designed using earlier versions of QSDS do not need to be
   re-designed; simply note that duration is 6 months.

Not really...  As I recall, Cleon made it very clear that he was 
denying citizen ships to robots, etc...  Besides which the Imperium 
in TNE (Regency) doesn\'t even acknowledge that a friendly Virus can 
exist...

He might be 34% better in numerical rating, but because of the normalized
bell curves of the new task system (which, so far, looks just like my games
save for lower dice totals) the difference between a 15 asset and an 18
asset (or any other sample) is dependant upon task difficulty. On 2.5 dice
or less, it\'s no difference, three dice it\'s about 5%, on 4 dice it\'s
closer to 30%, on five dice, as you climb back down the bell,  the
difference becomes marginalized again.

To all the stat whizes: I recall doing the other method (calc probability)
in stats class; the \'brute force\' method is faster and easier...

I whole heartedley DISAGREE. I want  a skill list, and the weapons list.
Why a skill list? it keeps me honest, realistic and fair (Something I get

Yes and no.  I agree that the "formal document" would be focused on things 
Imperial; the common man would have little place in the document.  HOWEVER, the 
3rd Imperium has already been described as expanding relatively peacefully 
initially.  One of the easiest ways of doing that would be to allay the fears 
and worries of the mass of common folks inhabiting the soon to be absorbed 
worlds.  The main document would be pointed at defining the Imperium and its 
benefits for the ruling classes  But there would need to be something there for 
others; thus the Twelve Precepts.  The Precepts are a codicil or addendum to 
the main document, much like the Bill of Rights are to the Constitution.  In 
the case of the Constitution, the codicil has  as much or more weight than the 
original document, but that is the result of time and interpretation.

Remeber, the Imperium is modelled on a feudal structure; it must have some 
measure of support or buy-in from the lower and middle classes, who will be the 
source of the empire\'s funds and power.

It was not clear to me exactly when Cleon said this.  It may be that these 
words need to be "blurred" so that it would be necessary for Cleon to slap 
himself on the forehead and clarify it later with the above statement.  Fromt 
he way the original quote was worded, I think he was attempting to clarify the 
definition of "protected being", so perhaps the first precept would be a 
statement about the beneficial and parental relationship between the Imperium 
and its protected beings.

Aha!  The Imperium (rightly) does not care about the hapless Joe.  This precept 
is one of the loophole ones; all it says is "The _Imperium_ will not interfere 
with your being free to think and beleive whatever you want."  It does not say 
"You are free to act on your beleifs" or "The Imperium respectes and agrees 
with your beleifs," and it most especially does not say "The Imperium will 
prevent your planetary government/ruler from interfering with your thoughts and 
beleifs."   Again, this one is a selling point to the non-rulers.

I think this one is worded badly.  What I was intending here was a statement 
that member worlds could not arbitrarily block space traffic through their 
systems.

>>to the safety, security and well-being of the Imperium.  <BIG loophole here>

Mistype on my part; it was supposed to say Imperial Nobles, not Imperial 
Citizens.  Basically an extension of the Right of Appeal for nobles so that 
nobles beig naughty on member worlds are still tried by the Imperial nobility, 
not the 3rd Circuit Court of the planet Podunk.

>>12.  An acknowledgement that, when a conflict exists between an Imperial

Actually, to be more specific I was thinking "Those powers not specifically 
granted to the several member worlds of the Imperium are reserved to the 
Imperium, and those powers granted to or enacted by the Imperium shall take 
precedence over those of its several member worlds."

Thanks for the insightful response, Dave.  At least _somebody_ read my stuff.

    'body' => '        Well, here\'s my draft, banged out while I was waiting for the
Marathon: Infinity Demo to finish downloading.  It includes both text (I
have not counted the words) and "Official Commentary".  I\'ve taken into
account several of the suggestions made over the list to date, as those of
you who made them may recognize (Stu?  Glenn?  Jeff?).

        Those of you who are legislatively savvy will note that the balance
of power is *de jure* massively in favour of the Emperor; the Moot and the
Nobles as individuals are almost wholly dependent on Imperial good will.
However, I think that the practical realities of governing something the
size of the Imperium would mean that the individual Nobles within their
Fiefs, and to a lesser extent the Moot, have much greater power, *de
facto*, since Cleon and his descendants couldn\'t oversee everything.

        Given the absolute nature of the power being wielded here, I don\'t
think that it\'s neccessary to get into much nitty-gritty; thus, this is a
very open-ended document.  It aims to give the Emperor as much elbow room
to rule as possible.  It does not foresee methods of dealing with given
situations; it just creates the power to deal with them.  Thus, the
Imperial Rules of War are, for the moment, not incorporated.  Neither are
any Imperial agencies, Bills of Sophontic Rights, etc.

        It provides for three distinct types of instrument by which the
Emperor may exercise power.  I visualize proclamations as being akin to
legislation; they would be the instrument via which laws of general
application would be declared.  This is how the Basic Law is put into
force.  Decrees would be used to declare special measures applicable to a
given place or situation (such as declaring sector-wide Martial Law or
whatever), and Edicts would be used for executive purposes more specific to
individuals or small groups, such as enfeoffing Nobles, ordering Imperial
servants to perform certain actions, create Imperially-incorporated
corporations, etc.

        The jurisdiction and trade provisions at Articles 6 and 8 are to be
read as allowing near-perfect freedom of trade in areas under Imperial Law,
but allowing local governments to, say, outlaw the importation of clothes
*into its jurisdiction* if its laws forbid wearing clothes.  However, a
trader could ship a load of petticoats *through* its territory so long as
they are to destined for  another jurisdiction.

        Finally, note the succession provisions at Article 2; I left these
deliberately vague in order to provide for chaos and confusion conducive to
good campaign scenarios :).

        So... comments?


Proclamation of the Restoration of the Grand Imperium of the Stars
and the Rule of Man


1.  Whereas it is in the interest of all sophonts that peace, order, and
good government be established and the freedom of trade maintained, the
Grand Imperium of the Stars, by Proclamation of His Imperial Majesty Cleon
Zhunatsu, Heir to the Imperial Throne, is hereby restored at this first day
of the Year 0 at [fill in place].  The planets of the former Sylean
Federation are hereby declared to be the Worlds of the Imperium.

2.  The August Person of His Imperial Majesty, and those of his hereditary
successors, is the font of Justice and Authority, and Supreme Commander of
all Imperial Armed Forces.  His Imperial Majesty dispenses Justice and
exercises Authority over all the Worlds of the Imperium.

3.  All the various persons resident upon the Worlds of the Imperium, or in
the Spaces Between The Worlds are the subjects of His Imperial Majesty, and
are Citizens of the Imperium.  Any world that petitions to become a World
of the Imperium, or which is attached by conquest or other means to the
Imperium, shall become a World of the Imperium, at the discretion of His
Imperial Majesty, by Special Proclamation of His Imperial Majesty.

4.  His Imperial Majesty may, at his discretion, enfeoff those of his
subjects that he deems worthy of such honour as Nobles, in ranks and
gradations such as he may deem desirable, to enforce Imperial Law and
exercise Imperial Authority by delegation in such regions of Space as His
Imperial Majesty deems fitting, subject to any Edicts, Decrees, or
Proclamations emitted by His Imperial Majesty.

5.  His Imperial Majesty shall retain full jurisdiction over the Spaces
Between The Worlds.

6.  His Imperial Majesty shall permit the various laws and governments of
each World of the Imperium to continue to run to a distance of 100
diameters of the planet, asteroid, or other body upon which their
jurisdiction is situated, subject to any Special Edicts, Decrees, or
Proclamations to the contrary, save upon the territory given over to Port
facilities, which shall be be under the jurisdiction of Imperial Law.

7.  All Worlds of the Imperium shall adopt the Imperial Calendar and the
Imperial Credit as the currency of trade between the Worlds of the
Imperium.

8.  The Freedom of Lawful Trade, being the lifeblood of the Imperium and
the living of His Imperial Majesty\'s subjects, shall only be interfered
with by Special Edict, Decree, or Proclamation emitted by His Imperial
Majesty.

9.  Those subjects which His Imperial Majesty has enfeoffed as Nobles shall
be members of the Moot.  The Moot may advise His Imperial Majesty and
deliberate upon such matters as His Imperial Majesty may delegate to them.
In addition, consent of a bare majority of the Moot is required for any
Special Edict, Decree, or Proclamation to enter into force.  The Moot shall
be empowered to legislate upon any subject upon which His Imperial Majesty
has not already legislated.  His Imperial Majesty may, unless opposed by no
less than nine tenths of the members of the Moot is session at the time, at
any time revoke any or all legislation passed by the Moot, and pass Edicts,
Decrees, or Proclamations in its place.  The Moot shall be convened and
dismissed at the discretion of His Imperial Majesty.


           Official Commentary to the Proclamation of Restoration:



Art. 1  A preamble whereby the Imperium is declared to have been done and
its raison d\'etre outlined.  The "peace, order, and good government"
wording has a long historical lineage that can be traced back to the
Constitution Act, 1867 of a Terran nation named Canada.  It should be noted
that freedom of trade is granted importance equal to these in the
Restoration Proclamation.

Art. 2  This Article clearly establishes that the source of all Imperial
Powers is the Person of His Imperial Majesty: He is the fount of all
Imperial Law, Authority,and Power, whether it is exercised by His Imperial
Majesty or those upon whom he has conferred Nobility.  It also defines the
territorial scope of His Imperial Majesty\'s jurisdiction, i.e. The Worlds
of The Imperium and The Spaces Between The Worlds.  Finally, it also states
that Imperial Succession was hereditary in nature, although as drafted it
only requires that the Heir to the Imperial Throne be a member of the
Imperial Family: it does not provide any rules for the succession.  Thus,
choice of a successor is implicitly left up to His Imperial Majesty.

Art. 3  This Article grants His Imperial Majesty personal jurisdiction over
all persons within the Imperium; the use of the term "persons" brings legal
persons, such as corporations or other legally created bodies with status
similar to that of individuals, under His Imperial majesty\'s jurisdiction.

Art. 4  This Article defines the Imperial Discretion to enfeoff Nobles; it
is deliberately left vague in order to adjust the size of and rankings
within the Nobility, and the various regions over which the may rule by
delegation, in order to suit the changing needs of a growing Imperium.  It
should be noted that the power to supersede Noble jurisdiction was reserved
by His Imperial Majesty.  Unfortunately, the explicit power to disenfeoff
Nobles was not drafted into the Restoration Proclamation; however, it is
generally accepted (save by those so disenfeoffed) that His Imperial
Majesty, by enfeoffing another Noble to rule over the same territory, may
thereby indirectly disenfeoff Nobles.  It should be noted that the exercise
of Imperial Authority also includes the power to enfeoff lesser Nobles.

Art. 5  This article reserves the Spaces Between the Worlds, a term which
includes both normal and Jump space, to Imperial Jurisdiction.

Art. 6  This article provides that local law shall continue to run
following their submission to Imperial Rule, unless His Imperial Majesty,
by Special Edict, Decree, or Proclamation (which requires consent of the
Moot) provides otherwise.  Spaceports, however, are to be enclaves governed
by Imperial Law.  It leaves the question of taxation and duties owed to the
Imperium up to the discretion of His Imperial Majesty, who may, by Special
Edict, Decree, or Proclamation (which would be subject to consent by the
Moot) impose such taxes or other measures as He sees fit.

Art. 7  This Article provides that in the interests of all, the Imperial
Calendar shall be adopted throughout the Imperium, and that the Imperial
Credit shall be the medium of interplanetary trade.

Art. 8  This Article enshrines the Freedom of Lawful Trade as sacred, and
subject only to regulation via Special Edict, Decree, or Proclamation,
which, as noted, requires the consent of the Moot to come into force.
This, when read in combination with Article 6, is to be interpreted as
forbidding any interference with lawful trade, i.e. trade in anything not
illegal under Imperial Law, in areas under Imperial Jurisdiction (i.e. The
Space Between The Worlds and Imperial starports).  The Worlds of The
Imperium may regulate trade in the areas under their own jurisdiction.

Art. 9  This Article creates the Moot, and defines its membership, role,
subsidiary legislative power.  It provides that a bare majority of the Moot
shall be required to consent Special Edicts, Decrees, or Proclamations, and
that a supermajority of no less than 90% of its membership shall be
required to block revocation of Moot legislation by His Imperial Majesty.

 Not really - especially if one level of attribute does _not_
 equal one level-equivalent of skill (if it does, as written,
 tweak as needed). The attribute is representative of
 information or ability that is applicable generally to a wide
 range of specific skills - or, more accurately, to a wide range
 of tasks where any of those specific skills will be helpful.
 In a sense, it\'s a limited Jack-of-all-Trades skill, that can
 be used as a favorable modifier to the probability of
 successfully completing a task.

 Take EDU, for example.  It doesn\'t necessarily refer to
 specific knowledge (that\'s what skills are for), but it can
 legitimately be representative of reasoning and analytical
 skills/abilities that might allow you to apply other knowledge
 to a task at hand.  INT might also represent something similar.

 [Deleted]

 Herewith my proposed Imperial Charter (my personal notes are in
 {} braces):
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
 Preamble - Proclamation of the Imperium

 We, Cleon Zhunastu, recognizing that the present structure
 governing the Sylean Federation is inadequate for governance of
 a necessarily expanded entity, and with the acquiescence of the
 present Government of the Sylean Federation, declare that the
 Sylean Federation has outlived its usefulness, and is
 dissolved.  We further proclaim that the worlds formerly of the
 Sylean Federation shall be members of a new entity, to be
 referred to henceforth as "the Imperium".  We further proclaim
 that we, Cleon Zhunastu, are assuming Imperial power for the
 period necessary to ensure a stable and enduring Imperium.

 Article I - Imperial Governance, Membership, Citizenship

 The Imperium shall exercise no direct governance over any
 member world.  Instead, the purpose of the Imperium shall be to
 provide for the defense of all of the member worlds as a group,
 and to bring the rule of law to the spaces between worlds.

 A world shall be defined as a body of planetary size that is
 populated.  Included in this definition shall be planetoid
 belts, defined as a region of space around a central star to
 which the component planetoids are gravitationally bound, such
 that not less than two-thirds of the planetoids so bound shall
 have not less than two-thirds of their respective orbits within
 that region.

 Any world may, through a recognized representative, proclaim
 allegiance to the Imperium, and in so doing, such world shall
 become a member of the Imperium, equal in status to all other
 members of the Imperium.  Member worlds shall govern themselves
 as they see proper, provided that such government does not
 violate Imperial laws.

 The exclusive jurisdiction of a member world shall extend to
 100 (one hundred) times the diameter of the member world,
 measured from the center of mass of the world.  The exclusive
 jurisdiction of a member world that is a planetoid belt shall
 extend throughout the region that defines the member world, and
 to all planetary bodies or planetoids that traverse that
 region, and to 100 diameters of such planetary bodies
 or planetoids or 1000 miles, whichever is greater, measured from
 the center of mass of the planetary body or planetoid.

 A member world that is the sole member world in its stellar
 system, and which has the technological capability and
 sufficient personnel to enforce its laws throughout the system,
 may, upon proper notification to and acceptance by the
 Imperium, exercise exclusive jurisdiction throughout the
 stellar system.  If a second world shall apply for membership
 in the Imperium from such system, the first member world shall
 have the right to veto such membership.

 The Imperium reserves to itself the power to create as it sees
 fit governmental entities superior to the member worlds but
 subordinate to the Imperium.

 The Imperium reserves to itself the power to create as it sees
 fit bureaus and agencies to carry out and enforce the Imperial
 will.

 The Imperium considers as citizens any sophont native to or
 naturalized by a member world of the Imperium.

 A world governed by a member world is not itself a member
 world, but is considered to be part of the member world, and
 all inhabitants thereof are considered to have the same rights,
 protections, and obligations under Imperial law as the
 inhabitants of the member world.

 Article II - The Emperor, Hereditary Succession

 The Powers of the Imperium shall be vested in an Emperor, who
 shall maintain that title and those powers until his death or
 voluntary abdication.  Upon such death or abdication, the title
 and powers shall pass to the oldest child of the Emperor,
 provided that the child shall have been publicly acknowledged
 as the Emperor\'s by the Emperor, and providing that there are
 no conditions which would disqualify the child as fit to
 maintain the Powers of the Imperium.

 Article III - The Moot, Nobility

  },
  {
    'body' => '(Continued from previous message)

 The recognized nobles of the Imperium shall provide their
 advice and counsel to the Emperor prior to any legislation or
 action by the Emperor.  The recognized nobles, acting in this
 capacity, shall be designated the Imperial Moot.  The Imperial
 Moot shall have two powers over the Emperor:  They shall have
 the power to declare the dissolution of the Imperium, and they
 shall have the power to disqualify an Imperial Heir Apparent
 from ascending to the Imperial Power.  However, the latter
 power shall only be exercised for just and proper cause.  If
 the Emperor dies or abdicates having provided no heirs either
 by blood or by adoption, or if no heir of the Emperor is found
 fit to maintain the Powers of the Imperium, the Moot shall have
 the power to designate the recipient of the Imperial Powers.
 Should the Moot find it necessary to exercise this power, the
 designee shall be a citizen of the Imperium.

 A recognized noble of the Imperium shall be a sophont granted a
 noble title by the Emperor or by one empowered by the Emperor to
 grant noble titles.  Noble titles granted by member worlds may
 be recognized by the Imperium on a case-by-case basis.

 Article IV - Free Trade

 The Imperium shall support free trade between its members.  No
 member may impose import or export tariffs on any goods
 involved in trade between member planets.  No goods may be
 barred from trade by a member because of place of origin or
 destination.  No member shall engage in piracy or smuggling,
 nor allow its territory to be used for piracy or smuggling, nor
 shall issue letters of marque or other permission for ships
 operating in its territory to engage in piracy or smuggling.

 Article V - Standards

 The Imperium shall conduct all of its activities according to
 the Imperial Calendar, which shall consist of a Year made up of
 365 (three hundred sixty five) consecutive Days of 24 (twenty
 four) consecutive hours each.  The Days shall be numbered 1
 (one) to 365 (three hundred sixty five) in order.  The day that
 this Charter shall become effective shall be designated Day 1
 of Year 0 on the Imperial Calendar.  Day 1 of any Year on the
 Imperial Calendar (henceforth Imperial Year) shall be
 designated as an Imperial Holiday, named Holiday.

 The unit of exchange in interstellar commerce, and between the
 Imperium and the member worlds, shall be the Imperial Credit.
 The Imperial Credit shall be valued independently of the value
 of any coin, currency, or value of any member world.  The
 Imperium shall have the responsibility and power to control the
 value of the Imperial Credit.

 The Imperium shall use as its standard of measurement the
 presently accepted standard measures and nomenclature used by
 the Sylean Federation.  These standards shall be designated the
 Standard Imperial Measurement System (SI).

 {Here ends the matters that Marc specifically mentioned in his
 post.  The rest (and some of the above) is all "etc."}

 Article VI

 Chattel slavery shall not exist in the Imperium, nor on its
 member worlds, nor on any world with which a member world shall
 have dealings.

 Article VII

 The governance and operation of starports is reserved to the
 Imperium.  Movement of material and sophonts between the
 starport and the member world shall be controlled by the member
 world, subject to Imperial laws governing such movement.  The
 territory of a starport shall be excluded from the jurisdiction
 of the member world, and no material or sophonts shall enter
 the starport area from the member world without the express
 consent of the starport operating authority.

 I can\'t think of anything else that\'s needed, and I suspect
 that my verbosity can be reduced.  Comments?  Debate?
 Amendments?  I\'ll keep quiet on this topic until August 21,
 unless I am specifically asked to clarify or comment.  If you
 are asking for such clarification or comment, please ensure
 that you ask me _by_name_ - I won\'t respond to "what does
 \'dealings\' mean in Article VI"; you\'ll have to ask "Jeff, what
 did you have in mind when you said \'dealings\'?" (i.e., if the
 question does not have my name in it, I won\'t answer.)

This is the best I\'ve seen so far!  A few comments are included within the
document...

>Proclamation of the Restoration of the Grand Imperium of the Stars and the
>Rule of Man

[Restoration is appropriate.  This isn\'t the creation of *an*
Imperium, but the continuation of THE Imperium.]

>1.  Whereas it is in the interest of all sophonts that peace, order, and
>good government be established and the freedom of trade maintained, the
>Grand Imperium of the Stars, by Proclamation of His Imperial Majesty Cleon
>Zhunatsu, Heir to the Imperial Throne, is hereby restored at this first
>day of the Year 0 at [fill in place].  The planets of the former Sylean
>Federation are hereby declared to be the Worlds of the Imperium.

[The word stability rather than good government might be more
appropriate.]

[Because this is a restoration, *all* the systems once attached to the
Imperium should be considered *still* attached.  They should be *invited*
to reaffirm their fealty to the Emperior and the Imperium. A general goal
of extending the peace, order, and stability of the Imperium throughout all
space should be expressed.]

>2.  The August Person of His Imperial Majesty, and those of his hereditary
>successors, is the font of Justice and Authority, and Supreme Commander of
>all Imperial Armed Forces.  His Imperial Majesty dispenses Justice and
>exercises Authority over all the Worlds of the Imperium.

[..but graciously allows local governments to continue governing their
worlds.]

>3.  All the various persons resident upon the Worlds of the Imperium, or
>in the Spaces Between The Worlds are the subjects of His Imperial Majesty,
>and are Citizens of the Imperium.  Any world that petitions to become a
>World of the Imperium, or which is attached by conquest or other means to
>the Imperium, shall become a World of the Imperium, at the discretion of
>His Imperial Majesty, by Special Proclamation of His Imperial Majesty.

[Residing is a little bit too encompassing.  All persons *born* within
Imperial Systems or in space between Imperial Systems, and all persons who
have registered their intent, pledged *fealty* to His Imperial Majesty, and
been accepted into His graceious protection are Citizens of the Imperium,
with all rights and responsibilities therein.]

[Systems would pledge fealty to His Imperial Majesty and petition for His
gracious recogniztion and protection.  Don\'t directly mention conquest!!! 
Every system that comes in will pleage fealty and petition..even if it\'s
the nobels and/or government put in place by the the Imperial Navy after
they depose the former government. <g>]

>4.  His Imperial Majesty may, at his discretion, enfeoff those of his
>subjects that he deems worthy of such honour as Nobles, in ranks and
>gradations such as he may deem desirable, to enforce Imperial Law and
>exercise Imperial Authority by delegation in such regions of Space as His
>Imperial Majesty deems fitting, subject to any Edicts, Decrees, or
>Proclamations emitted by His Imperial Majesty.

>5.  His Imperial Majesty shall retain full jurisdiction over the Spaces
>Between The Worlds.

>6.  His Imperial Majesty shall permit the various laws and governments of
>each World of the Imperium to continue to run to a distance of 100

>jurisdiction is situated, subject to any Special Edicts, Decrees, or
>Proclamations to the contrary, save upon the territory given over to Port
>facilities, which shall be be under the jurisdiction of Imperial Law.

[Don\'t limit it to Port facilities, because it will apply to Navy, Army and
Scout bases as well.  Simply say...save upon territory given over to
Imperial use, which shall be under the jurisdictioin of Imperial Law.
Imperial use can then be interpreted to mean Port facilities, Military
bases, Research facilities, or *anything* else. A broad interpretation of
this provision would provide for
interdicted systems as well.]

>7.  All Worlds of the Imperium shall adopt the Imperial Calendar and the
>Imperial Credit as the currency of trade between the Worlds of the
>Imperium.

>8.  The Freedom of Lawful Trade, being the lifeblood of the Imperium and
>the living of His Imperial Majesty\'s subjects, shall only be interfered
>with by Special Edict, Decree, or Proclamation emitted by His Imperial
>Majesty.

[Slight change:  ...Majesty\'s subjects, shall not be interfered with,
except by Imperial Edict, Decree or Proclamation.]

>9.  Those subjects which His Imperial Majesty has enfeoffed as Nobles
>shall be members of the Moot.  The Moot may advise His Imperial Majesty
>and deliberate upon such matters as His Imperial Majesty may delegate to
>them. In addition, consent of a bare majority of the Moot is required for
>any Special Edict, Decree, or Proclamation to enter into force.  The Moot
>shall be empowered to legislate upon any subject upon which His Imperial
>Majesty has not already legislated.  His Imperial Majesty may, unless
>opposed by no less than nine tenths of the members of the Moot is session
>at the time, at any time revoke any or all legislation passed by the Moot,
>and pass Edicts, Decrees, or Proclamations in its place.  The Moot shall
>be convened and dismissed at the discretion of His Imperial Majesty.

[This is the only Article with which I have a real problem.  The Moot is
granted too much power.  I never saw the Moot as a
legislator, dealing with laws, edicts or decrees.  I saw it more as a the
public expression of the Fealty between the Citizens of the Imperium and
it\'s Imperial Majesty.]

[It appears to me that the Moot really only had two functions:  (1) They
could disolve the Imperium by publicly renouncing their fealty; (2) They
could confirm the Emperor by declareing their fealty to Him. To my
knowledge, they did *not* have the power to pass edicts or legislation,
whether by majority, super-majority or unanimous consent.  Therefore, I
would limit their role to the following:]

The Moot, by unanimous public acclaimation and in the presence of His
Imperial Majesty by individually renouncing their fealty, may disolve the
Grand Imperium of Stars and revoke all authority exercised thereby.

  [I\'d suggest that they have to do this 3 times on consecutive
   days.  So yes they can disolve the Imperium, but by ghod it had
   not only better be unanimous, but they better have *all* the
   powers lined up with them or they\'ll never live to do it. <g>]

The Moot, by unanimous and public acclaimation, will confirm the authority
of the Imperial Personage, pledging fealty and receiving His gracious
protection.

   [Notice I didn\'t say they elected the Emperor.  I said that they
    will *confirm* his authority and exchange pledges of fealty.
    This leaves it open as to how the Emperor is actually selected,
    as we all know, but does give the Moot a role to play.  A role
    that *could* include background King-making.]
   
A feudal structure is based on mutual rights and responsibilies, and an
exchange of pledges.  I see the Moot as being where the Nobels in person
and the public by proxy exchange these pledges with the Emperor.

I\'ve got a hardback on-order, and I figured to get a softbound from my
local game store.  The hardback is my \'keeper\', the softbound I\'ll wear
out. 

I\'ve called Labyrinth, the game store here in town, every day this week
asking, "Is the new Traveller in?"  Yesterday, while the guy was checking
to see if it had come in I heard in the backgound, "A new Traveller?  I
want a copy of that too!"  <g>

         worlds of the Federation, who supported Cleon\'s assumption of
         imperial power.  I can see this scenario:

         Cleon, holder of some moderately prestigious noble title, and
         powerful because of his wealth and industrial holdings, sees the
         chaos and inefficiency of the Federation.  He starts lobbying the
         major nobles to support him in reviving the Imperiate and his
         assertion of his claim of to the title.  For whatever reason,
         enough nobles support his claim that at a Federation gathering the
         nobles "spontaneously" swear swear an oath of fealty to Cleon:  by
         acclaimation of the gathered nobles back Cleon Zhunastu\'s claim to
         be the sole remaining heir of the 2nd imperium (and by extension,
         the 1st).

         Overwhelmed by the outpouring of support, Cleon accepts the title,
         affirms the nobles\' titles and priveleges, and guarantees their
         sovreign control of their holdings.  In his acceptance he states
         the principles of the empire: free trade, local sovreignty, noble
         priveledge.  The individual nobles in turn pledge that they will
         support Cleon and the Empire.

         After this, one would assume that there would be some minor
         skirmishing between factions supporting Cleon and those who
         favored the Federation (or perhaps a rival claimant).  This could
         either be a major struggle or a minor annoyance, whichever seems
         more interesting from the storytelling point.  In the end, Cleon
         prevails, with the support of the noble familys.  Many nobles are
         dead, and Cleon takes the opportunity to create new ones, beholden
         most strongly to him.  As new planets are assumed into the Empire,
         the local nobility are made Imperial nobles.  When no local
         nobility exists, an Imperial governor is appointed (usually a non-
         inheriting child of an important noble family) and given a title
         comensurate with the status of the planet.

         The problem with the previously suggested documents (IMHO) is that
         they are too specific.  I never saw the Imperium as a
         constitutional monarchy, with an Emporor limited by law, but as a
         construct built out of the tug-of-war between the nobles, as
         represented by the Moot, and the Emporer.  When the Emporer is
         weak, as at the begining of a reign, or during a regency, the Moot
         will assert it\'s powers, when the Emporer is strong, the Moot will
         receede in importance.  Tradition is the basis of the power play,
         and expediency, not law.  The only document per se is the oath of
         fealty taken by Cleon in response to his coronation, outlining
         person rights and responsibilities between the Emporer and the
         nobles. This would be the basis of all Imperial coronations...
         maybe something like this:


                          OATH OF SYLEA

         KNOW ALL that we, CLEON ZHUNASTU, Lord of Sylea, Protector of
         Terra and Vland, Emperor of Man, willingly and fully accept the
         charge put upon me by the acclaimation of the asembled Lords, and
         recalim with a glad heart the Imperial throne, so long vacant.

         WE joyously hear the solemn oaths of fealty of the Lords, and
         accept their pledge of service, loyalty and honor to us and our
         heirs, and confirm to them and their heirs all titles, estates,
         priveledges and responsibilities as recognized by law and
         tradition.

         WE also confirm the right of the assmbled Lords to the swift and
         fair resolution of their grievances in the courts of their Lieges.
         Furthermore, the Dukes of the Realm are charged with the
         responsibility of hearing all appeals, and of appealing to the
         Emporer all cases which, by right and merit, demand Imperial
         justice.

         FURTHERMORE, we remind the Lords that the free passage of persons
         and goods among the stars being the primary wealth of the Realm,
         that they are obliged to secure and defend the starlanes from any
         interference, and in whatever manner their Leige requires.

         IN REMEMBERANCE OF THIS OATH, every 365th day shall be set aside
         for the renewal of oaths and the elevation of the worthy to the
         ranks of the nobility.

         Taken this 1st day of the Holiday year, 0

         ----

         I see all the rest - the right of assasination, the rules of war,
         the naming of nobles to represent worlds that have no local
         nobles, etc, as changes wrought as the Imperium expanded.  This
         provides a reason for the concentration of nobles in the Domain of
         Sylea, and fits with the notion that many of the noble titles and
         houses predate the 3rd Imperium.  The give and take of how
         Imperial law took shape over the next 1000 years is the fun part.

I can\'t decide whether I am proud or ashamed to say that I have already

Perhaps it is the abuse I\'ve put it to, but the cover doesn\'t seem to be

It\'s good to know more than just those of us on-line have a desire to get 
the new Traveller. :)

Humans: the OTHER other white meat. 

Story idea for any budding authors out there:  Aliens have already 
secretly arrived in America, and have been feeding off of us for 
decades.  By the 1950\'s, they had noticed that their mortality rates had 
gotten much worse.  After doing exhaustive research, they discovered that 
the cause was the high fat content of their American diet.  So, 
they began taking over the fitness, fashion, and advertising industries 
in order to get us to eat better and excercise more.  By the mid-70\'s, 
their mortality rates were back in line.

Next time you see an Ab Master or Butt Buster infomercial, or an 
advertisement featuring one of those "waif" models, remember who is really 
responsible for it and why they\'re doing it.

Well, yeah.  What would be the point of coming to Earth, meeting a 
completely different, intelligent species, if not to have sex with them?

The parties forming the Imperium are (1) Cleon; (2) the Nobility, which
already existed and was largely composed of descendants of Terran proconsuls
dispersed to govern the Ziru Sirka after the Interstellar Wars; and (3) the
Worlds that are not directly governed by nobles (i.e, most worlds).  The
rights and place of groups -- what I have elsewhere in these lists called
"collective rights" -- are much more important than those of individuals.

The people themselves -- the Citizens of the Imperium -- aren\'t parties to
this agreement.  Actually, everyone is a citizen of his or her world first,
and of the Imperium second.

Imperial citizens don\'t have Imperial rights of due process or equal
protection, because if they did, the Imperial government would be hopelessly
enmeshed in governing the Worlds.  The United States government, by
contrast, constantly intervenes in state governance where the state is
violating civil rights recognized under the federal constitution.  That\'s
not the situation in the Imperium.

and shall subscribe to this Declaration. >The Worlds have jurisdiction over

Actually, the Worlds don\'t have full sovereignty, because they don\'t have
the right to determine their own foreign policy with regard to
extra-Imperial polities.  Maybe "suzerainty" is a better, vaguer, term.

The Imperium thus expressly ratified the pre-existing political and economic
relationships among the nobles inter se, and between the worlds and nobles.

There is, as discussed by others, no provision for removal of the Emperor.
The Emperor either dies or abdicates.  The "legitimate successors" language
allows an Emperor to select a successor, and allows the Emperor\'s family
members to take their shots at the throne if no successor has been selected.
"Legitimate" means legitimate in light of pre-existing noble practice
(primogeniture or whatever might have been in place; I suppose something
much more flexible than primogeniture).

I\'ll tell you why not a skill list...  Because *most* skills are 
self-explanatory as to what they do, and once the players develop 
familiarity with the system, and the skills their particular 
characters possess, you aren\'t going to need to look at a skill list. 
 Why waste a whole page with a list of skills (which won\'t have 
definitions, so you\'ll still need to look them up), when you could 
put things like encounter tables, the task system, handy combat 
tables, etc... there...

I\'ve had it happen too. My guess is that someone has *subscribed* to
the list from through an anonymous remailer, or faked a subscribe from
one. Possibly to "mail bomb" the anonymous site.

If that\'s the case, what we are seeing is a *stupid* mail program

This is one reason why I started generating bunches of NPCs in advance.
You can fit the basics on a 3x5 card, and then when you need a random
character of a certain "class" and "level", you can just flip thru the
right section of the file. And always remember to update the card after
the encounter (even if they get killed, you can just recycle the card).
Some may develop into true "characters, worthy of a sheet and more
detailed records. Most will stay at the "rent a thug" class.

It *does* help to have a character generator program. But doing it by
hand is easy enough, especially if you do it as a way to fill
commercials or the like.

        Neither. But when Marc Miller declared that T4 would return to
thruster plates as the "standard" maneuver drive instead of an alternate
technology, the fuel balance was thrown way off. The reason TNE changed the
jfuel from the normal (1+Jump)x10% was because the new fuel-based reaction
drives like HEPlaR sucked down mucho fuel. Going back to higher jfuel
requirements was necessary if the mdrive no longer sucked it down. Otherwise
ships that traditionally couldn\'t make more than a single jump without
replacing cargo with fuel could make several with a full load of cargo.

        There are certainly aspects of TNE I like; at the very least I\'ll
buy the T4 setting books, though. Further decisions will have to wait until
I get home and read my book.

        I still don\'t think the Imperium will care one whit about the common
folks. The Imperium has to convince the planetary rulers. The rulers worry
about the hoi-polloi. Obviously, since they\'re rulers, they\'ve got some
method or another of dealing with them.

        Again, the Imperium is worried about the top of the feudal
structure. The top then worries about those below it, etc. ("Big fleas have
little fleas ...")

        First, you\'ve guaranteed the internal sovereignty etc. ... not said
the Imperium won\'t interfere, but guaranteed it as an absolute. If Joe
Stalin decides to brainwash somebody, they can claim he\'s interfering with
their internal sovereignty AS GUARANTEED IN THE IMPERIAL CHARTER.
        And I doubt the Imperium really will guarantee it, even in the
limited form you\'re advocating. Human rights are a 20th century western
concept; they would very definitely limit the emperor\'s power from the outset.
        Not that some emperor won\'t come up with a "Proclamation of the
Rights and Privileges of All Sophonts." But putting it in the charter isn\'t
appropriate,

        Again, put this under "Free Trade." Don\'t spell it out; the Imperium
just sets the precedent the first time somebody tries to block passage, and
cites "Free Trade."

	So what, T4 changed task system, T4 changed ship design,
	T4 also changed a lot of other things (I think) So it\'s
	IMHO imposible to continue a campain using T4.

	But what kind of customer\'s should buy T4 then.

	My local games store told : "TNE was like lead in the
	stock, I did\'nt think that we order T4". They even
	have some german CT scenarios and some MT sourcebooks
	still on stock.

	As T4 is\'nt a continuation of CT-MT-TNE but a complete
	break, I dont think that (here in the backwoods of
	germany) lots of people want to switch. And if they
	dont switch, newbees will buy "RPG featuring the film

WARNING THE FOLLOWING IS SAID ENTIERLY IN JEST.  PLEASE DO NOT BECOME

So you\'re saying Cleon was a racist determined to keep the robot in a 
slave like role.  

In essence he was no better than the Solomani, a two faced lying SOB 
intent upon denying basic human rights to a limited group of individuals 
based on their external appearance.

Actually it\'s worth a though, perhaps the Third Imperium managed to keep 
itself afloat though the universal use of slavery...  Hummm...

You\'re reading way too much into what\'s been discussed.  Character 
Generation is virtually the same...  Yes there is a task system, but 
the presence of a different task system doesn\'t make the MT or CT stuff 
all that unusable with this system  (its a whole lot less of a 
departure from MT/CT than TNE was).  Heck, I\'ve been running CT era 
stuff under the MT system for years.  I converted my CT ship designs, 
tweaked the task rolls for certain things, and voila...

Yes, Starship Combat & Design are different...  If anything, the cleaned 
up versions are better...and a lot more compatible with each other than 
Book 2 & High Guard were...  This game is a lot closer to CT than either 
of the other post-CT systems...

The original CT as it is was a graybeard.  The facelift of a 
task system, as well a newer better ship design system, should make 
it a more state of the art system, without sacrificing much of the playability 
of the old CT system...

etc, etc..

This is almost exactly how I saw it. Cleon was a opportunistic 
politician who had to sell his reborn Imperium to the public. And 
what do politicians give us at times like this? Lots of stuff 
about dreams -- little specifics. The more details there are, the 
more there is for people to disagree about. When Cleon made his 
declaration he didn\'t know if the public would just shrug their 
shoulders, say \'there goes another power-mad politico\', and walk 
away. 

Cleon was also concerned how his declaration would play outside 
the borders of his newly restored Imperium. Worlds thinking of 
perhaps joining would be put off by any aggressive talk. What they 
would want to hear is that Cleon would be leaving all existing 
planetary governments intact.

There was no need to put in an article on rights of assassination. 
The overthrow of the vilani First Imperium by the human Second was 
achieved through war -- as much a precedent as anyone would need 
that shooting people was an acceptable means of political 
advancement. Wes is spot on when he says tradition and expediency 
are what guides the imperial government.

I like the way Wes stresses the way the Emperor is seen to get his 
powers from the assembled nobility of the Moot. Although he was 
the victor in the Wars of the Roses, Henry VII gained much of his 
legitimacy as King in that almost his first act when he staggered 
off the field at Bosworth was to summon Parliament -- and 
Parliament turned up. Since only the King could summon Parliament, 
ergo Henry must be King. Cleon might be acting in a similar way in 
summoning the Moot, a body not assembled since the fall of the 
Second Imperium, to hear his declaration.

/Really?/  Amazing.  Either the distributor is alloting X number per 
store (ie, not allowing them to order as many as they want) so they 
anticipate a shortage, or the store is run by someone totally ignorant of 
how to please customers.

Thanks for the applause. :)  Actually, the scenario was one my wife and I 
came up with a while back.  Hadn\'t found a use for it yet, so I decided 
to post it when the opportunity presented itself.

BTW, I note the last name and domain similarity with Stu Dollar.  Let\'s

Because, in many cases, it helps to have the skill list handy when GM\'ing.
It also puts it in a convinient place (if on back of Screen) for the
players. Alas, not only are most players NOT going to know the skill list,
they are even more unlikely to know the cascades and clusters.

And again, as a  GM, it helps to avoid confusion (especially since the
skill list, once again, has changed!!!!!) if the GM has a copy of the skill
lists, which, as you pointed out so nicely, would be almost self
explanatory, so that he does not confuse his poor players with the wrong
skill names (a major problem I currently have both as player and GM) when
calling for task rolls.

Also, unlike some on liners, I actually have a group that is constantly in
fluxz as to players, around a core group. I almost ALWAYS have NEW PLAYERS.
Many times they are first time RPGers, and Traveller is their first
experience in the hobby. Confusing them is bad. Making the game run
smoother is good. A half page skill list (two collumns, small type, should
work.

With experience, most GM\'s know the skill list pretty well...at least 
well enough to know what 1 means.  In addition, the character sheet 
has the relevant skills the particular character is going to need, so 
there isn\'t much need for them to look 1 up either...

I just think there are probably better things the limited space on a 
GM screen could be put to...

Subject: JG, Materials Tech, Decks, Regulation, GenCon

Dear Folks -

1.	 JUDGES GUILD

Who owns the rights to JG products now? I\'m especially thinking of "50
Starbases", which has a lot of great material for people like Andy Lilly. 

2.	FUTURE MATERIALS

Peter  H. Brenton:
>...was wondering what applications will arise from the presence of large 
amounts of materials which, in our present day, are only available in 
small quantities and are therefore too expensive for everyday use.

In the Watchmen comic, Dr Manhattan created large quantities of lithium. 
This led to the production of batteries in large quantities, allowing 
cars to be battery-powered. In turn, this cleaned up the environment, 
freed petroleum for other uses, and preserved oil reserves.

This type of speculation (make something available, then see what happens 
to a society) is the basis for heaps of science fiction:

	The "slow glass" idea from _Other Days, Other Eyes_, Bob Shaw.
	Grav belts from _Vertigo_, Bob Shaw.
	Transfer booths from various titles by Larry Niven.

...Just to name a few.

BTW, did you know that the *Sarafand* (_Ship of Strangers_, Bob Shaw) is 
written up as a Traveller ship? It was published in "The Sarafand File", 
Paul Vernon and Sean Masterson, _Imagine_, issue #29, August 1985, TSR UK 
Ltd, Cambridge, UK.

The article includes:

- - the Cartographical Service logo;
- - full (vertical!) deck-plans;
- - Traveller HG (and Star Frontiers) stats;
- - Striker (and Star Frontiers) stats, pics, and plans of the Survey Modules;
- - 5 scenarios.

The rest of the mag included and interview, and "Executioner\'s Moon", a 
new *Sarafand* story.

Fans of Bob Shaw might be interested in one of his approaches to writing:

"Quite often my books are set five or ten years in the future and just 
one thing has changed. There is one scientific development. I write that 
novel about how the change affects some people. I try to write it as if 
it\'s not an SF novel, but a novel which would have been regarded as an 
ordinary novel five or ten years in the future when this development has 
occurred."

3.	VERTICAL DECKS

My take on this is that those small ships that land on planetary surfaces 
have horizontal deck plans. Large ships (eg. the *Azhanti High 
Lightning-class*) and ships that do not land (eg. the x-boat, x-boat 
tender) have vertical decks. This seems to match published designs.

I must admit, I created a ship that has *both*, depending on which area 
you are in (it is a "close" structure, ie. many bits bolted together). To 
transfer from one area to another, you use "lifts" - all these do is 
rotate thru 90 degrees. After all, you can do amazing things with grav 
plates. One of my players - APM - designed a Rhylanor mall where people 
on the "roof" walk upside down. A kind of corkscrew ramp connects the 
real floor with the wall-mounted stores and then to the ceiling-mounted 
stores. Not that I\'d want to shop there; even with massively-redundant 
systems, I\'m sure a glitch will occur somewhere (hmm, is this a 
detective-style scenario in the making?).

4.	INTERSTELLAR REGULATION

Back in _Merchant Prince_ or _Merchants and Merchandise_, merchant crews 
had to be pass "exams" in order to be rated suitable for a particular job 
ranking. Maybe just expand this principle?

5.	GENCON FOR THOSE DOWN-UNDER

Think of the biggest Australian con you have ever been to (Cancon \'93, 
1100 people) and multiply by 50 (approx 50,000 at Gencon, are my figures 
still accurate).

Differences (apart from the obvious, already stated):

1. You cannot enter as a team, only as an individual player. Knowing what 
the con organisers go thru over here ito scheduling, that is probably a 
decision made in order to preserve sanity.

2. No freeforms. Freeforms (equivalent to "How to host a Murder", except 
using AD&D, Cthulhu, Traveller, or systemless) are an Oz invention.

3. HEAPS (and heaps and heaps, etc) of stalls. T$R takes up the middle 
bit with their castle (at least, this seems to be the case in all the 
pics I\'ve ever seen).

Now it is up to one of our insider attendees (eg. Joe Walsh) to correct 
my view of the con. ;-)

1.	IMPERIAL CHARTER

Uh, 1000 words only - this says to me that all the "Charter" is going to 
be a fairly general listing of the raison d\'etre of the Imperium, and 
broad brush-stroke statements about how the thing will be organised. 
Specific details would be left to later sub-sections or sub-charters. 
Presumably, a citizen could appeal against a clause in a lower charter if 
it runs contrary to the spirit of the overall Imperial Charter. Actually, 
Steve Charlton said this better, that the thing serves as a foundation 
for "real" laws to be based upon.

Looking at Jeff\'s meister-werk, this is... not bad. Certainly, I can see 
that some of the initial Articles will have changed by 1100*, but these 
work fine as the initial Articles posted by Cleon.

* for eg., extrality. In the 1100 Imperium, there may be more than one 
starport per system. While at least _one_ of these must be 
extraterritorial, the others may or may not be.

As for:

>This one single right (the right of any citizen to appeal to a noble), I 
might see in this document.

In _The Spinward Marches Campaign_, the ref\'s instructions are to allow 
the PC\'s to present their case to the squadron commodore. He could 
"listen to the group and then make a decision". This suggests that an 
Imperial military leader, of sufficient rank, has certain legal powers 
(of course, maybe it only suggests that he is a noble, and therefore has 
legal clout as a member of the ruling classes).

Roderick Darroch Elliott\'s work is fantastic. (The amount of talent on 
this mailing list is awesome!). However, I have a quibble over Article 6 
of the Commentary. Change "Spaceports" to read "Those Ports given over to 
the Imperium, however...". This fits better with the wording of the 
actual Charter, which is vague enough to allow ports to be Imperial 
("given over") or not Imperial. I believe that this re-wording works even 
better than Jeff\'s original starport section.

...And Eris is quite correct in saying that this wording should be more 
general to allow for bases, Research Stations, etc. Good pickup!

I believe that his comments about the Moot are also correct. The Moot is 
only a deliberative body, and has only ever been granted the two powers 
Eris mentioned. Really, it is only *one* power - the power to decide who 
to pledge loyalty to.

Wes\' "Oath of Sylea" is just brilliant! Perfect language for such an 
occasion. Perhaps this *is* the initial proclamation, and the Charter 
came later.

2.	3-SIDED DICE

One way my players cam up with for 1/2 dice is to colour the spots.

(Assuming white dice w/black spots):

Side	Action

6	Paint three dots white (becomes a "3"

5	Paint the edge dots white (becomes a "1"

4	Paint two diagonally-opposed dots white (becomes "2")

I admit that I was initially disappointed that T4 would go back to a d6 mechanism.  I\'ve attempted
to design game systems in that past, and usually prefer some type of even distribution (no bell curve).  
When a modifier is applied, it\'s effect is consistant across all possible rolls.  I was discussing this 
with the guy that introduced me to RPG\'s oh so many years ago, who is currently a GURPS fan.  For the 
reason outlined above, I\'m not (although I do really like it\'s character generation).  Anyway, the 
discussion went that his character needed 12 or less for whatever task, and mine needed 8 or less 
(arbitrary system w/ 3d6, I don\'t remeber GURPS).  If we both recieve a +4 (for whatever reason), that 
will increase my target significantly more than his, percentagewise, and seems to be an unreasonable 
mechanism.  From that point, we decided that any modifier would need to be some percentage of the 
target number (does HERO do this?).  However, a minus modifier would need to be figured differently, 
probably reducing the whole thing to table look-ups (another thing I don\'t care for).  At that point, it
dawned on me, that I haven\'t heard anything modifiers to the task roll in T4.  Can someone confirm or 
deny that?  (How\'s that for a long winded question?).  If there isn\'t any modifier, then I may actually 
take a look at this (I\'ll be a lemming and buy it anyway.....), and, who knows, even play it.  Even though 
I might change my mind about a d6 system, I doubt I\'m going to like the half die thing.

Here\'s something that I\'ve been doing since I first got book 6 and generated star systems by hand.  The 
population digit reflects the exponent of the actual population.  By the rules, no population is the same 
as a population of 1-9.  That always struck me as odd, especially after gov\'t, law, and tech are generated.  
Does \'.-...000-0\' mean nobody is there or that there are 1-9 people with not gov\'t, no law, and primative 
tech?  I\'ve been leaving the last 4 digits blank, which leaves no question about who might be living on 
that world.

I\'ve noticed a couple of comments about linux in the last couple of days.  I recently bought a new PC with 
this WinMac95 thingee on it, and really am not impressed (that\'s the polite version).  I haven\'t found a 
good news reader (the one in Netscape sucks--that\'s also a polite version), and was wondering how well it 
was working for those using it?  

I was going to comment about the Imperial Declaration thingee, but everything that I thought of was just 
disgruntal comments about current American politics........

        Many thanks!  I\'ll incorporate some of the comments since they make
such brilliant sense (I was a little unsure myself about how I treated the

        Naw... the POGG wording allows the Emperor to send the Imperial
Navy in to intervene with a Noble\'s fief on any number of grounds: peace is
disturbed, order is disrupted, or good government not being provided.
Stability would be covered under the order heading, and good government can
be used to justify intervention on a much wider range of grounds >:).

        Right.  I\'ll tweak accordingly.

        Well, the residence test is what the Canadian Income Tax Act uses
to determine whether Revenue Canada can ding someone: of course it\'s broad
:).  However, I\'ll defer to your superior knowledge of things Imperial and
go with a citizenship test (what the IRS uses).

        Gotcha... however, you could argue that by explicitly stating that
absorption by conquest is permissible, it\'s thereby legitimated.  I\'ll
think about this one for a bit.

        Good one.  I\'ll amend accordingly.  Wording it as "territory given
over to Imperial use" is nice and ambiguous and could lead to squabbles
over whether to interpret it as including space lanes or not :).

        You\'re quite right.  Stricter wording, vaguely reminiscent of the

        Jeff... a few comments:


        It sounds really nice but it\'s worded in some places so as to
*limit* Imperial power, and it\'s too detailed.  If anything it reads
vaguely like the Canadian Constitution (which, IMHO, goes a little far into
the details).  The situation here is one where Cleon is trying to set up
something wherein he will have as much personal power as possible to run
things.  Thus, he\'d have wanted to make the Imperial charter as flexible as
possible.  Leaving it vague, and not dealing with the nitty gritties, is a
good way of  doing this.  What it doesn\'t cover would be up for grabs, and
since Cleon is the most powerful party involved, he\'d be in the best
position to grab it.  Thus, I don\'t think he would have gone to the level
of detail that you did, and he would have worded it to permit him doing
whatever he felt like if he needed to.

I don\'t know about xboat, but it\'s been a slow weekend on TML and

T4 does have DMs, just like in previous versions of Traveller.  However, 
they do seem to be less numerous than in CT, since there is no DM matrix 
for weapons vs. armor now that penetration is taken into account (that 
is, it is now possible to score a hit but not do any damage because the 
armor worn by the defender absorbed the attack).  

Just looking at combat, there are still DMs for range, concealment, 
darkness, increased/decreased damage attacks, attacks to disarm, evading, 
aimed fire, and more.

 It seems to Me that any declaration of policy for a expansive and 
aggressive Empire would have to be long on loopholes and short on
details. You would not want to tie the hands of any of Your Millitary or
Diplomats when They work in a fluid enviroment like Empire building.
You would brief You surrogates as they went out and over time the real
Policies would write themselves.
 What will the Document look like ask a Lawyer, Politician or Used Car
salesman.

here is a first draft outline of what I would consider to be such a 
system.  If there is interest, I (or we) can develop it.  Suggestions from 
those interested in such a system would be appreciated.

===========================================================================
The Rediculously Simple Space Combat (RSSC) System

1.  Determine Initiative
        Each side rolls 1D, with a DM of the task force commander\'s 
        leadership skill (if any).  Highest roll wins.

2.  Movement
	A)  The initiative winner may choose to flee unopposed.
	B)  The initiative loser may choose to flee, but the other side
            is entitled to one final attack.

2.  Attack (Initiative winner)
        A)  Laser Fire is resolved
            1)  Sandcasters, etc. taken into account
            2)  Damage, if any, is determined
        B)  Missile attacks resolved
            1)  Defending laser fire taken into account
            2)  Damage, if any, is determined

3.  Attack (Initiative loser)
        A)  Laser Fire is resolved
            1)  Sandcasters, etc. taken into account
            2)  Damage, if any, is determined
        B)  Missile attacks resolved
            1)  Defending laser fire taken into account
            2)  Damage, if any, is determined

Repeat process until one side wins or withdraws, or both sides are unable 
to continue.

========================================================================
General Comments/Questions:

Way back in the old days, my group used a system similar to this for 
resolving most space combats.  Surprise, boarding, etc. were all 
resolved in a storytelling manner, rather than in a wargame manner.  It 
worked for us, anyway.

As I see it, one of the major complications in ship-to-ship combat is 
movement.  Get rid of that, and you get rid a lot of DMs.  Any comments 
on the "movement" system listed here?  Keep in mind that if we add 
movement, we pretty much end up with the system in T4 due to the 
additional actions having a movement system implies.

What sort of defenses should be allowed?  Sandcasters are easy enough, as 
is defensive use of lasers.  What about screens, dampers, and black globe?

What sort of attacks should be allowed?  I like lasers and missiles, but 
should we add others?

What about rules for boarding?  When are participants allowed to board 
opposing ships?

Additional comments and questions are welcome.

Continue a T:TNE (New Era) campaign with T4?  Why would you want to?
Instead, consider T4 when you\'re starting a new campaign.

> 	But what kind of customer\'s should buy T4 then.

Someone who wants:
1) Easier-to-use starship creation and combat (included in the basic
   rulebook, as opposed to being separate products in T:TNE).
2) A new set of scenarios, featuring a more hopeful world than the 
   doom-and-gloom of MT and T:TNE.  IMHO, Traveller was never supposed
   to be a "dark future" game.
3) Rules designed for Science-Fiction role-playing, instead of recycled
   "generic" 20th century rules (T:TNE was based on Twilight:2000 mechanics,
   and showed it - particularly in its bias for late-20th-century
   slugthrowers).
4) A new "vision" of the world of the Far Future.

> 	As T4 is\'nt a continuation of CT-MT-TNE but a complete

I don\'t think that\'s an accurate summary.  I\'ve been playing Traveller from
the CT days and, although there have been a lot of changes, I think it\'s fair
to say that T:TNE was the "break" in the sequence.  T:TNE wasn\'t compatible
with what came before it, and isn\'t compatible with what comes afterward.

Classic Traveller is the original, and in many ways MegaTraveller was a
(mostly) compatible, errata-ridden "upgrade".  MegaTraveller did, however,
have an entirely differnet starship construction system than CT did.
MegaTraveller\'s character generation, skill and task, and combat systems
were all "compatible" with CT, so that you could take your old character
into the new system (or vice-versa) without trouble.

T:TNE was entirely-incompatible with CT/MT.  Character generation was different;
skills and attributes were handled differently, and you had to convert
characters to continue them from a CT/MT game into T:TNE.  T:TNE also had
new and completely different starship creation rules.

T4 is more a return to CT/MT than an entirely new system; however, the
starship design systems are based more on T:TNE.  Except for the differences
I outlined earlier, T4 ships are legal T:TNE designs (remember: in T:TNE,
the T4 ships are optional variants; in T4, T:TNE ships are technologically
backwards).

Still think it\'s best *not* to explicitly state it.  Specifically, talking
about conquest is sure to raise the hackles of every system outside the
Imperium, bad politics, and not *Imperial* thinking anyway...see only *bad*
guys conquer.  Good guys:  "liberate
territory", "normalize relationships", "stabilize the border", "take under
our protection", and "extend our Imperial influence."

Never one for overstatment, are you Joe?  <g> 

This is basically, "You stand over there, and I\'ll stand over here and we
shoot at each other until:  a. somebody runs, b. somebody dies, c. we run
out of bullets."  <g>

I like it!

I see this kind of system being used, not in warship vs warship type
combat, but when the PC\'s lightly armed ship takes on another lightly armed
ship, say pirates, custom\'s boat, or something like that.  Is that how you
see it?

Why not Ship\'s Tactics skill?  The Pilot (or Commander) having that skill
should give their ship advantages in the combat and the only real advantage
you are allowing is first shot/evade.

I get your point, but why would you ever choose (B)?  

Why not make this a contest of skills (maybe Tactics again), where complete
success means (A)+you get the last shot, partial success means (A), partial
failure means (B), and complete failure means you fail to break the
engagement off.

Hopefully, you are going to use skills like Gunnery here?  Skill contests
between the two sides Gunnery skills might work well.  Come to think of it,
contests of Sensor Skills should come into play too.

I\'ve always done pretty much the same, very much roleplaying things out,
using skills (and skills contests) and abstracting everything else.

See above.  <g> 

I don\'t have a problem totally abstracting it to:  (1) stay and fight, or
(2) run.  Range *is* a problem though.  T4\'s basic system uses range bands
doesn\'t it?  That\'s as complicated as *I* want to go, and even then it
could be as simple as:  long range, close range, contact (for boarding).

>Keep in mind that if we add movement, we pretty much end up with

Yeah, I know how complicated it can get, I\'m an old wargamer from the more
detailed the better school.  Isn\'t it strange I don\'t play RPG\'s that way?
<g>

>What sort of defenses should be allowed?  Sandcasters are easy enough, as

As optional add-on\'s, yes.  Just do Sandcasters at first.  Then add
defensive lasers. Then add the others as options.

>What sort of attacks should be allowed?  I like lasers and missiles, but 
>should we add others?

Well, if you have optional rules for screens, dampers,and bg\'s then you
should include optional rules for particle and meson beams. 

Just do Lasers on the first pass..Lasers vs Sandcasters.  Then add Missles
vs defensive Lasers. Then add particle beams, etc.

>What about rules for boarding?  When are participants allowed to board 
>opposing ships?

Without any closing movement, that\'s a good question.  Maybe for movement
you should have three choices:  evade (run away), maintain distance (keep
range constant), close (close in for a boarding action).

System.  I have a suspicion that it\'s somewhere between your\'s and T4\'s
basic system.

===========================================================
                    The RSSC System

Ranges...    

There are 5 abstract ranges:  Out of Contact, Out of Range, Long Range,
Short Range and Contact.

Out of Contact  - beyond sensor range, unsighted
Out of Range    - sighted but out of weapons range
Long Range      - Long range weapons may fire
Short Range     - Long and short range weapons may fire
Contact         - Ships are in contact for boarding, no weapon fire

A ship may attempt to move from any range to any adjacent range during a
combat turn: Short to Contact, Long to Out of Range, etc.


Movement actions...

The three movement actions are:  Evade (move away), Maintain (stay in same
range band), Close (draw closer).

Movement is based on a ship\'s Mdrive rating + appropriate crew skills.


Weapons...

Totally abstract at this point.


Beginning...

This process begins at the range determined by the GM (usually Out of
Range).


Roleplaying...

Roleplaying is be encouraged at each step in this process:  PC\'s may
attempt to communicate with the other ship; roleplay damage control
attempts, undertake Boarding actions (when possible), or anything else they
want to do.


The Process...

1.  Initiative (contest of Leadership+Ship\'s Tactics Skills)
    Each side rolls 1d6+Leadership+Ship\'s Tactics.  Highest number
    has Initiative.
    
2.  Movement
    A. Player WITHOUT Initiative attempts movement action.  Call
        Evade, Maintain, or Close (Contest of Ship\'s Mdrives+Ship\'s
        Tactics).  Highest number wins, but player	WITH Initiative
        may concede contest.
    B. Player WITH Initiative attempts movement action.  Call Evade,
        Maintain, or Close (Contest of Ship\'s Mdrives+Ship\'s
        Tactics). High number wins.

[Comment:  By making the player without initiative move first you give the
player with Initiative the advantage of seeing what her opponent is doing
before moving.  Also, notice that the player with Initiative can *let* her
opponent\'s action succeed.]

3.  Attack
    A. Player WITH Initiative attempts to attack
        1. Laser Attack vs Sandcaster Defense, and damage applied
        2.  Missile Attack vs Defending Laser Defense, and damage
            applied
    B. Player WITHOUT Initiative attempts to attack    
        1. Laser Attack vs Sandcaster Defense, and damage applied
        2.  Missile Attack vs Defending Laser Defense, and damage
            applied

[Comment:  Here we let the player with Initiative go first.  I abstracted
the process of determining the success or failure of the attacks and how
the damage is applied at this point.  I\'d like to see Sensor and Gunnery
skills involved in this as well as some measure of the attacking weapon\'s
effectiveness vs defensive weapon\'s effectiveness.  This should be a skill
contest too, but the weapons have to be taken into account.  Damage could
be handled in several ways, but at this point let\'s just leave it in the
air.]

4. Repeat as needed.

===========================================================

Am I getting too complicated?  What do you think?

Good!  Then you\'re in the exclusive club of RSSC designers. [G]

That\'s exactly it.  When my players had their far/fat/free trader, and a 
lightly armed pirate ship closed with them, we\'d run the simple ship 
combat system we developed.  But this, as you note, isn\'t suitable for 
large battles.

You are exactly right, Ship\'s Tactics skill should be used.  But, I have 
an excellent reason for not using that: it\'s not a part of T4.  :)  It\'s 
now called simply, "Tactics."  :)  Which is a long way of saying you\'re 
right, I goofed.  Replace "leadership" with "tactics."

You\'re right again.  Thank God I labelled this a "first draft overview!" ;)

I\'ll make the change you suggest here, too.

You mean for sandcasters vs. lasers?  A skill contest sounds reasonable 
for that.  

As for sensors...I have no idea how to work them in, unless we go with a 
range band system...which means we\'d end up with something very close to 
the system in T4.

Without range, your sensor ops technician has nothing to do.  With it, we 
have T4 Space Combat.  I dunno.

Makes sense.

Sounds good.  Levels of complexity...

If we decide not to do ranges and movement, that would work for 
boarding.  

I\'m still unsure as to whether we should use ranges, though.  Any more 
comments?

Interesting.  Base the chance for moving on the Mdrive rating.  I like that.

This should be what this system is all about. :)  I\'m glad you mentioned it.

Good, but Leadership+Tactics(T4), though. :)

This makes sense, and is "proper" under T4\'s Ground Combat rules, which 
use the same initiative/movement order.

Sounds good in theory, but we could easily get to the point where each 
side is adding and subtracting many different values.  Not bad if you 
only have to do it once per battle, but if any of those vary during the 
battle (due to damage or changing range, for instance) then it could become 
cumbersome.

T4 Ship Combat is a 10-step process comprised of: Task Force Assembly, 
Initiative, Range, Break Off, Sensor Action, Declare Fire, Weapon Fire, 
Launch/Recover Vessels, Breakthrough, and Pursuit.  If we add the last 
three to the RSSC, we essentially have the T4 system.  Perhaps there is 
no need for a RSSC.

In Glenn\'s gloss, he suggested that the word "sovereignty" was

Oh, I like this "empower such institutions as may from time to time be
necessary."  You can do anything you want with this.

I would change this to "from time to time at the Emperor\'s discression"

Also, what about imperial revenues?  Is that covered under "such
institutions..." or is their a clause needed along the lines of "...may
assess from any planetary government any tribute of any amount or form as
should be deemed neccessary for the govenance of the Empire.."?  Should the
Moot have to agree to something like that?

Finally, I have never heard of a institution such as this with a "disilusion
clause,"  is it a good idea?

	IMHO movement is the most interesting part in space combat.
	Ok being uncertain about sensor tasks is also very nice.

> What about rules for boarding?  When are participants allowed to board 
> opposing ships?

	Boarding is trivial if a ship is drifting and has no
	PP for the lasers.

	IMHO boarding is posible if the ship is only capable of 1g
	as thuster packs perform 2g. The ship has to have a velocity
	where the boarding party can reach the ship.

	Get connected to the ship :

	- e-suit difficult (ships evasion makes this formidable (1g), or
	  imposible (2g))

	Disable thusters, lasers, etc.

	- enabling : e-suit average + technican difficult
	  (disabling thusters can be hasadrus)

	Get on board :

	- Mining laser average

	The most crasy part when boarding are the last two clicks
	before the party can connect to the ship, as the ship can
	fire lasers on the party. But they need a formidable sensor
	lock (a Vac-Suite is sub micro), or if the party is equiped
	with EMM-Vac-Suits the ship needs an imposible sensor lock
	on short range.

I really don\'t know, I don\'t have the *dang* book!  ;-<  

Does T4 use the PC\'s skills for each action?  Does it make the combat
basically a contest of (skills + system quality) between the 2 ships?

I\'d like to keep looking at this though, and if it starts looking just like
T4 (or just as complicated) them we can drop it.

Now, I\'ve already got some modifications for my modification! ;->

1.  The ship\'s MDrive rating is the number of d6\'s you add to your Tactics
skill.

2.  Ties go to the ship with Initiative.

3.  If the number of d6\'s goes negative, that\'s the number of dice you
subtract from you Tactics skill.
                                                             
Here\'s the start of a short battle:

Fast Pirate (MD4, Leadership 8, Tactics 8, Base Init=16, wants to
    close to short range and then board)

    vs 

Slow Trader(MD1, Leadership 6, Tactics 12, Base Init=18,wants to
    avoid the fight, but if it can\'t prefers long range exchanges of
    laser fire)

Trader Joe is surprised by the Pirate coming around the Gas Giant. They
start Out of Range.

Round 1
Initiative: Pirate Ship 16+1d6 (3) = 19
            Trader Ship 18+1d6 (2) = 20 *wins
            
Pirate Moves: Attempt to Close to Long  8+4d6 (13)=21* wins
              Attempt to Block         12+1d6 (6) =18                           


Ships are at Long Range

Trader Moves: Attempt to Evade to Out of Rng 12+1d6 (6) =18
              Attempt to Block                8+4d6 (14)=22* wins 
                
Ships remain at Long Range

Trader Attacks with Long Range Weapons and Pirate defends, there is a hit
on the Pirate\'s engines dropping him to MD3.

Pirate Attacks and Trader defends, minor hull damage.

End of Round 1

Round 2
Initiative: Pirate 16+1d6 (5) = 21
            Trader 18+1d6 (5) = 23* wins

Pirate Moves: Attempt to Close to Short  8+3d6 (9) =17
              Attempt to Block          12+1d6 (5) =17* wins 

Ships remain at Long Range

Trader Moves: Attempt to Evade to Out of Rng 12+1d6  (3) =15
              Attempt to Block                8+3d6 (14) =22* wins
              
Ships remain at Long Range

Trader Attacks and Pirate defends, hit on sensor array reducing firing
accuracy.

....etc, etc.

This part seems to work pretty good.  <g> Of course, I haven\'t even
*looked* at weaponry at all, so it could start getting more
complicated...don\'t know yet.

>For the end of the document, I would include something called The Twleve 
>Precepts.  Like the 10 amendments in the Bill of Rights, these Precepts are
not 

A preface to my comments on the 12 Precepts:  The Imperium is not a
constitutional monarchy.  It is a hands-off autocracy -- i.e., the autocrat
keeps his or her hands off the internal affairs of the member states and
nobles, and does whatever he or she wants elsewhere.

>The Twelve Precepts
>1.  Any sentient life form within the Imperial Borders, regardless of its 
>origin, is a protected
>being, and thus a citizen of the Imperium.

This is canon.  I take "protected" to mean only protected from enemies
external to the Imperium, however, and not to mean protected by civil
rights.  Otherwise, the Imperium gets inextricably enmeshed in local governance.

>2.  A guarantee of the internal sovereignity of Imperial member worlds,
subject 
>to the safety, security and well-being of the Imperium.  <BIG loophole here>

Internal sovereignty (which I\'ve elsewhere called suzerainty, borrowing from
Britain\'s treaty with the Orange Free State) should be guaranteed, but
within the document itself, rather than in a codicil.  It\'s a big carrot to
balance the twin sticks of the Imperial Navy and external enemies.

>3.  A guarantee of the internal sovereignity of the thoughts and beleifs of 
>Imperial citizens. 

Absolutely not!  This is directly contradictory to 2, supra.  

Remember, too, that the Psionics Suppressions don\'t occur for 800 years
after the founding of the Imperium, and that psionics were legal, if not
widely understood or practiced, until then.  So governments that practice
any form of telepathic monitoring will be subject to lawsuits (or even
insurrection) by citizens claiming a right to freedom of thought.  

In addition, absolute theocracies will never join an Imperium that
legitimizes freedom of thought.

Steve\'s comments that Joe Average is necessary to the Imperium, and must
therefore be the subject of proper marketing, are well taken, but the focus
will have to be on protection from external enemies and protection of the
status quo.  If Joe doesn\'t like the status quo, he\'s a discipline problem
anyway.

>4.  A guarantee of the right of free passage for Imperial Citizens within 
>Imperial space, again subject to the safety, security and well-being of the 
>Imperium.

Free passage of goods and money (i.e., free trade) necessarily contemplates
free passage of people.  Such free passage should also be subject to the
safety, etc., needs of Worlds and Nobles.

>5.  A guarantee of the right of Imperial nobles to Imperial justice, and to 
>appeal to higher nobility.

The Imperium ratified all existing vassal/liege relationships; to the extent
that these provided for judicial redress, that right would still exist.  No
special provision is necessary.

>6.  A guarantee of the right of all Imperial Citizens to due process, subject 
>to the safety, security and well-being of the Imperium.  <BIG loophole here>

Again, no way!  See my response to 3, supra.  This will drag the Imperium
into all of the minutiae of local governance, which is the opposite of the
parties\' objective.

>7.  A statement of the responsibility of Imperial member worlds and
citizens to 
>support the Imperium and its laws, by action and through taxes

The member worlds and nobles are the parties to the Imperium, and have the
obligation to pay taxes and provide armed forces.  How they raise the taxes
and armies is between them and their citizens or vassals.  The amount that
they have to raise is between them and the Imperium, and is based on
individual treaties (which are not necessarily public documents).

>8.  An acknowledgement of the power of the Emperor to mete out justice, and to 
>overturn any ruling from a lower noble or court. 

The Emperor should be identified in the document itself as the supreme
judicial officer of the Imperium.

>9.  A statement of immunity from local laws and justice for the Emperor and
the 
>Imperial family

I probably don\'t object.

>10.  A limitation of the laws of Imperial members worlds to apply to those 
>worlds alone, and not to extend to Imperial space or territory.

No objection.

>11.  An extension of the Imperial immunity from local justice to include the 
>Moot and the Imperial Household.

Why not include this in 9?

>12.  An acknowledgement that, when a conflict exists between an Imperial
law or 
>decree and a law or decree from an Imperial member world or lesser noble, the 
>Imperial law or decree holds precedence

Definitely.

interference

Unpopular

I agree with your analysis here, but I think that it would shake out
differently in the  legal and political structure.

I agree with this analysis, but not with its conclusion, that the fealty
oath is the only document founding the Imperium.  Resolution of the
three-way power struggle (Cleon, nobles, and worlds not under direct noble
rule) would be memorialized in a marketing document -- i.e., a document to
be used to market the idea of the Imperium within itself and to potential
new members.

I\'m of the opinion that most political repression in the 
Imperium was done under the rubric of "local culture." 
 
The local authorities get the blame for being cruel, 
greedy, and opressive, while the Imperium rides 
high and noble above it (but doing nothing to  
change it due to the rule of local sovreignty). 
 
Not to imply that every local government was like  
this, far from it. But there were also plenty of places 
where it was true.

One thing that comes to mind right now is the miracle that\'s happening
online.
Nowhere in the gaming industry is the closeness of the Traveller enthusiasts
matched.  I have read notes and letters from most of the \'dream team\' behind
T4.  These haven\'t been just casual speeches from company execs talking to
the lowly customers.... no.... these letters have been intelligent,
thoughtful, and INTERACTIVE between both the creators and their loyal public.
 This is an occurance that is without match in any industry I\'ve ever seen...
 Who would have thought that the mailing list would have been instrumental in
the actual publication of any part of the newest version of Traveller?  I for
one think that all of the individuals involved deserve a round of applause
for their insight and their willingness to work WITH the very people that
they are writing the book(s) for!  The applause should be also for the
individuals of the mailing list that have given their comments and opinions
on a varity of aspects of the Traveller universe and the production of the
newest incarnation of Traveller.  The more I read, the more faith I have that
Traveller is being set up to really make a big splash in the gaming
industry.... T4 (typos and all) will be a big winner... if for no other
reason than that the interaction between the creators and the gamers is so
active and close that errors can be corrected almost as fast as they\'re
found.  Can TSR match that?  Not this year.... <grin>

     IMPERIAL ESTABLISHING DOCUMENT
     
     I think that Wesley Esser\'s Declaration of Restoration is brilliant. 
     The Grand Imperium of the Stars! Seems to have the right balance to 
     me, and gives the Emperor all the power he wants, while leaving most 
     problems to be solved by the nobility and individual planets. 
     
     The Third Imperium would only be called that by political scientists 
     and citizens - the Imperium would \'legally\' be the First Imperium, 
     just as the Rule of Man was still the First Imperium, (it even 
     retained the Vilani nobility!) just with Solomani overlords. 
     
     I also agree with (somebody\'s!) suggestion that this declaration 
     should invite former Imperial worlds to \'reaffirm their loyalty\' to 
     the Emperor; the Pacification Campaigns (Vland, Solomani Rim, Antares 
     and so on) would have happened when these \'Imperial worlds\' declared 
     their independence (and therefore became rebels against the Third 
     Imperium - a bit dubious legally, but if you\'ve got the guns...!). 
     
     My model for the Declaration would be as Wesley has outlined, with 
     minor changes, since what Cleon was doing was trying to establish 
     LEGITIMACY for his (essentially self-declared and illegal) new 
     Imperium. What Cleon\'s declaration needs is: 
     
     1. a call to historical precedent - what better way than declaring 
     your empire to be the legitimate descendant of a previous empire - 
     look at the German Third Reich (descent from Second Reich - German 
     Empire and First Reich - Roman Empire I think), the American Republic 
     (descended from British parliamentary democracy, American colonies, 
     and United States Confederation), Austro-Hungarian Empire (descended 
     from Habsburg & Holy Roman Empire which itself claimed descent from 
     Roman Empire) etc etc etc. 
     
     2. appeal to logic & security - need for peace and good governance, 
     economic development, protection vs. enemies, pirates, and so on. 
     
     3. establishing legitimate channels of power in the Imperium, both 
     physically (nobility) and through time (inheritance of noble title, 
     authority of Emperor to nominate new nobles)
     
     4. base of legitimacy upon the support of the existing Sylean nobility 
     (so of course the declaration would have to give them something!) - 
     therefore the Moot would be affirmed as the seat of the Imperium\'s 
     legitimacy, hence its power to dissolve the Imperium (essentially a 
     vote of no confidence!) and confirm Imperial heirs. Cleon would also 
     declare the Moot to be an advisory body to the Emperor, letting him 
     have the Moot do a lot of legislative donkey work while allowing Cleon 
     essentially a veto anyway! 
       - the Moot\'s later ineffectiveness would have come from the growth 
     of the Imperial bureaucracy and a long tradition of the Moot telling 
     the Emperor what he wants to hear anyway. 
     
     In order to get the nobility to sign on to his declaration (and 
     incidentally support him with their military and economic resources), 
     I think that Cleon would have given the Moot a fairly impressive set 
     of vague powers, knowing that in PRACTICE it could never get its act 
     together to oppose him. And of course reserve a veto power to himself 
     in case the Moot DOES get its act together. 
     
     The Moot itself would be ENORMOUS - literally thousands or tens of 
     thousands of nobles present, with theoretical membership in the 
     millions. Power would reside in various sub-Moots/committees/councils, 
     allowing most nobles to have a proxy vote represented and never having 
     to attend. Of course this setup would be a complete sh*tfight, 
     allowing the Emperor to do whatever he wants. Which is of course what 
     Cleon would have wanted all along.

Thruster ships will need lots of jump fuel to offset the advantage of not

There will still be HEPlaR ships in the game (lower TL).

These ships will be high enough TL to have jump drives (my assumption - 
could be wrong).

This means that HEPlaR ships with jump drives will be almost all fuel.

Is this correct?

Nasty Cleon, Nasty Cleon.  It hurt\'s ussss,  It hurts ussss.

This strikes me as pretty hypocritical, on one hand he\'s giving everyone 
equal rights and on the other hand he\'s saying so long as they\'re organic 
and it doesn\'t interfere with any local customs.

Yes but by merely turning it\'s back on these issues, perhaps turning a 
blind eye towards them you have pointed out one of the essential flaws of 
the Imperium.

"All citizens are created equal in the 3rd Imperium, unless you\'re a 
female Hadabranx from the planet Shrubbaries, in which case all your 
basic human rights are forefit because local custom deams it so, or if 
your a left handed basketball player on Jenovia 5 again local custom says 
one of you should be sacrificed to the sun god every morning at 8:00 
local time, sorry buddy that\'s a local customs issue, has nothing to do 
with me cuz I\'m the Emperor."

By allowing this kind of senseless behavior to be perpetrated on it\'s 
citizens the 3rd Imperium was doomed to failure from it\'s very inception. 
 It was a poor government more concerned with the collection of taxes 
than the basic human rights of its populace.

Of course this is my own take on things.

     IMPERIAL ESTABLISHING DOCUMENT

     Have you had any thoughts on the Imperial Establishing Document? I am 
     back on TML/XBML but I\'m too afraid to post anything in case I\'m 
     bumped off again. SO if you\'d be good enough to post this (plus any 
     comments of your own) I\'d be grateful! Maybe grateful enough to lend 
     you that copy of the Atlas of the Imperium...

     declare the Moot to be an advisory body to the Emperor, letting him 
     have the Moot do a lot of legislative donkey work while allowing Cleon 
     essentially a veto anyway! 
       - the Moot\'s later ineffectiveness would have come from the growth 
     of the Imperial bureaucracy and a long tradition of the Moot telling 
     the Emperor what he wants to hear anyway. 

     In order to get the nobility to sign on to his declaration (and 
     incidentally support him with their military and economic resources), 
     I think that Cleon would have given the Moot a fairly impressive set 
     of vague powers, knowing that in PRACTICE it could never get its act 
     together to oppose him. And of course reserve a veto power to himself 
     in case the Moot DOES get its act together. 

     The Moot itself would be ENORMOUS - literally thousands or tens of 
     thousands of nobles present, with theoretical membership in the 
     millions. Power would reside in various sub-Moots/committees/councils, 
     allowing most nobles to have a proxy vote represented and never having 
     to attend. Of course this setup would be a complete sh*tfight, 
     allowing the Emperor to do whatever he wants. Which is of course what 
     Cleon would have wanted all along.

It shouldn\'t mention the conquest of other worlds in the Constition, it
makes the Imperium seem like a bunch of war mongers.  Change it to just
petitions. Once you have invaded a world, you set up a new government,
it petitions for admission.  In the end its all the same, but it looks
better, to all the other non-aligned worlds.

Imperial Citizenship can\'t be granted to everyone at the start of the Third
Imperium, because a later emperor _extends_ citizenship to everyone as a move
to broaden support.

As this part of Traveller history is based, to a large extent, on the Roman
Empire, I suggest using a similar model, to whit:

Everyone living within the boundaries of the Third Imperium is an Imperial
Subject.  They have the priviledges of paying Imperial taxes (indirectly) and
following Imperial laws, are protected by the Imperium, and may enlist in the
auxiliary forces.

All citizens of the Sylean Federation become Imperial Citizens.  Imperial
Citizens are exempt from some taxes, have the right to have their legal cases
judged by an Imperial official, and may enlist in the Imperial forces.

Citizenship is hereditory.  It may be conferred as a reward for faithful
service or conspicuous heroism.  (Twenty years service in the Scouts or
Auxiliary Forces, for example, would grant Imperial Citizenship.)


Keeping in mind that Cleon must protect and support his power base in Sylea,
the blanket granting of citizenship to all Syleans gives them a priveldged
position.  However, as Citizenship can be granted to and earned by
provincials, the most energetic of the conquered/allied provinces get coopted
into the system.  It worked for Rome!

The best thing about this definition is that it is so vague.  The nobles
would happily believe that this means protection from external enemies only,
while the opressed masses would see the Imperium as a liberator.  Cleon
could then do whatever he wants.  Generally, actual enforcement would be
limited to a prohibition on slavery and mass genocide.  But the Emperor
could intervene on a pretext whenever oil supplies (or whatever the Imperial
equivalent is) are threatened.

This is a fairly unworkable definition of citizenship, as any visiting
foreigner becomes a "citizen," but it may have appeared appropriate when the
Imperium was founded.  At that time, the Imperium, like its Roman and
Chinese predecessors, may have aspired to rule everything -- contemplating
that there would be no foreign powers.  A more realistic definition of
citizen may have evolved when the Imperium reached its practical limits (the
Rhine or the Marches) or suffered a major reverse (like the Persian or
Julian Wars).

All governments are inevitably doomed to failure...they\'re designed

Undoubtedly, a thousand years from now, students in a class will be

No.  
 
(1) That would result in a virtually unarmed (except for the Imperial 
military) interstellar civilization, which is contrary to the 
ever-popular \'canon\'.  The standard ship\'s missile is a nuclear weapon, 
if we\'re still using FF&S technology (which I believe we are...). 
 
(2) Unworkable, unenforceable by the loose hegemony depicted here, 
and illogical.  Any TL8+ world with uranium or thorium deposits 
can build nuclear weapons.  Any factory that can build fusion 
plants can build fusion bombs.  Any TL 9-11 HepLar/Fusion rocket 
*IS* an continually burning fusion bomb.  Too hard to restrict  
without draconian restrictions on trade, production, dissemination 
of information, etc--all things amounting to massive interference 
with individual planetary polities, which the 3rd Imperium is notorious 
for *NOT* doing. 
 
It\'s also illogical; this is not 20th century Western civilization, 
confined to one world, still working out the implications of this 
new weapon invented scarcely 50 years ago--this is the birth of the 
3rd Imperium, TEN THOUSAND YEARS after the Vilani started playing  
with radioactives...  Nucleomiteophobia will probably be a 20th-21st 
century Earth peculiarity.  There are so many other ways to cause 
massive death and destruction when you have high technology, that 
nuclear weapons shouldn\'t stand out as specially more significant. 
Throwing rocks and falling spaceships, bioengineered diseases,  
designer toxins, carpet-bombing with "conventional" weapons,  
induced stellar flares, anti-matter weaponry, offensive use of 
weather control, offensive use of flood "control", just use your 
imagination... 
 
It\'s also counter-productive, because nuclear weapons have their non-combat

uses--few faster & cheaper ways to split a really big rock, dig a huge  
ditch, make a big hole--especially in vacuum or deep space, where 
environmental concerns aren\'t an issue. 
 
(3) Rather than focusing on nuclear weapons, forbid/discourage 
mass destruction and genocide.  If you focus on the enabling technologies, 
you soon realize almost everything can be dangerous if misused, and 
you put a leash on *ALL* technological development.  (Maybe that\'s 
why the Vilani stagnated?)  See Pournelle\'s CoDominium for an  
example of a SciFi milieu that fell into that trap, and eventually 
collapsed because of it. 
 
>2.  Customs and tariffs with regard to trade from outside the Imperium. 
 
Unlikely.  I\'ll leave this for someone else to discuss.

about the proclamation that started the 3rd Imperium.  The first discussion is 
about what declaration Cleon I made.  The second discussion is based on the 
document that laid the foundation for laws (constitution).  I think there were 
two documents.

I would propose that both discussions are correct.  Cleon I did make an initial 
declaration (proclamation) where he stated in very grand terms the need for a 
change and a return to past glories.  In the proclamation he probably stated 
that "he and the nobles" declared the return to the past glory of the Imperiums 
by establishing the Third Imperium.  When he issued the initial proclamation his 
power base was still limited. If it wasn\'t, why have the Moot. I believe that 
Cleon I included the Moot to appease the nobles while he solidified his power 
base.  The proclamation may have been issued in Year 0 or before.

The constitution came after the proclamation.  It laid the foundation for the 
laws.  Since it came later, Cleon had had time to consolidate his power but like 
many kings and emperors throughout history, it still wasn\'t initially absolute. 
However, since he had a stronger power base, the constitution would be more 
directive and authoritarian.  Since his power was still not absolute, the Moot 
is still included but with relatively no powers.  The constitution could have 
been issued in Year 0 or a few years later after Cleon had a chance to increase 
his power.

By seperating the two documents, I think we enrich Imperium history and weave 
political intrigue into the beginnings of the Third Imperium.  My health

As I recall, only four errors (other than typographical/grammatical 
ones) have been found:

1)  Character Generation:  The mustering out rules in the text do not 
match the rank tables given in the character generation table section.
	Fix:  Use the Traveller Ranks from the Mercenary/High Guard/Merchant 
              Prince rank tables, until IG tells us otherwise.


2)  Character Generation:  Skills in the Character Generation Tables 
which are actually referring to Skill Clusters should be in bold-face, 
but are not.  
	Fix:  Using the Skills List from the next chapter, compare each 
              of the skills in each of the character generation tables,
              and highlight, underline, or otherwise signify those that
              are skill clusters.

3)  Skills:  In the Skills List and in the Skills Definitions, skills 
which are usable at level 0 should be signified by being printed in 
italics.  This is not the case.
	Fix:  In the Skills Definitions section, skills usable at level 0 
are still signified by the word "default" appearing in the heading for 
that skill.  You may want to highlight such skills in the Skills List for 
easier reference.

4)  QSDS:  The QSDS system is missing two Jump Drive tables.  
	Fix:  Download the system from the web page of Derek Wildstar 
(the author of the system):  http://www.qrc.com/~wildstar/qsds/


Those are the only errors I know of.

To summarise:

Who drafts the Constitution? The Emperor
Who amends the Constitution? The Emperor
Who passes legislation? The Emperor
Who decides if a law is constitutional? The Emperor

So what can the Emperor do? You would think pretty much whatever 
he likes. There is, after all, no Supreme Court to keep the 
Constitution clean of the grubby pawprints of politicians. 

But the power of the Moot to reject an heir to the Iridium Throne 
should not be taken lightly. For a hereditary monarch there\'s 
nothing so important than leaving your Imperium to your offspring. 
The fact that the Moot can, out of pique, deny your pride and joy, 
and give the throne instead to that third cousin you always hated 
means that you have to worry about keeping the nobles happy.The 
high nobility are powerful men and women. And, continuing in a 
family vein, remember who runs the Navy? The high nobles sit in 
the moot; their younger brothers and sisters sit on the bridges of 
battleships. Remember what Archduke Norris was before his brother 
died..

In my universe, that *is* the biggest reason the Vilani stagnated, the
biggest reason the Terrans were able to defeat them, the biggest reason the
Rule of Man eventually collapsed, and the biggest reason the 3rd Imperium
will *eventually* collapse.  Not the only reason for all these things, but
the comman thread running through the entire Traveller history.  The Vilani
dominate human interstellar culture and they distrust anything new,
technology included.

The Vilani are like the old Chinese.  They can be conquored by the
barbarian outsiders, but within a generation or two, the outsiders have
*become* Chinese.  So in the grand scheme of things, who has conquored
whom?  <g>

Absolutely!

Have you ever thought about why so *few* people are traveling the starways? 
It\'s because the PC\'s are *exceptions* to the norm,
rogues each and every one of them!  That\'s what makes them *fun* to play. 
Most people are mundane, stay at home, old sticks in the mud, even in the
46th century!

No, it doesn\'t.  In all cases, it is system quality vs. system quality, 
with a note that "player skill may be used as well," leaving that aspect 
up to the individual referee.  This is the case with sensors (you have to 
lock on before you can even attempt to score a hit, and the other player 
can attempt to jam), firing weapons, etc. etc.

Sounds good.  I think we can definitely improve on T4, if nothing else.  
What we come up with may not be a truly RSSC system, but it will almost 
certainly be something better than what\'s in T4 (well..at least from OUR 
perspective! [G]).

How would the number of d6\'s go negative?  Sorry, I\'m slow tonight. :)

The initiative part does seem to work pretty good.  

As for weapons fire, we can go with the T4 task system (difficulty based 
on range = # of dice to toss; target number based on some formula 
involving gunnery skill, weapons quality, target\'s G rating, attacker\'s 
fire control rating, target\'s pilot skill...more?), or invent something 
else entirely.

I move we use sensor rules like those in T4 (lock on required before you 
can even attemt to hit, defender can attempt to jam), but modified to 
reflect greater reliance on PC/NPC skill.

We could do that, but at this point I\'m leaning to a T4-ish sensor 
lock/jam action for the sensor ops people.  What do you think?

But we didn\'t consider pilot\'s skill, although we do have tactics covered.

Very true, but it isn\'t unique to the TML.

I am also on the Harn-L list, and we\'ve been witness to one of the oddest
things I have seen in 20 years of gaming.  Columbia Games, the publishers of
the Harn line, proudly unveiled their latest product: HarnMaster2.  This is
the first Harn product in nearly two *years*.

At the same time as the GenCon debut, the primary designer for Harn
announced (via the list) that he was going to self-publish a "better" update
of HarnMaster.

Today we got a message from Columbia Games\' president.  He explained in
detail, in common language, and without pointing fingers at anyone, WHY Harn
has such a slow release record.

So you see, IG isn\'t the only Game Company to treat its dedicated fans
right; all the GOOD ones do.

>together.

Uh? Have we agreed to *anything* yet? <g>  

I don\'t think we have a system yet, but here\'s what I think we\'ve agreed
to:

General Principles...

1.  We want something simple for PC ship (non-warship) vs another
not-heavily armed ship.  The focus will be on 2 ship actions.  (If the
system doesn\'t get too complicated then *maybe* multi-ship could come
later.)

2.  Range and movement aren\'t especially important, but having a simple
abstracted system would be acceptable.

3.  We want to keep the rolls of dice, exceptions, and complicated rules
down to a minimum.

4.  We want skills to play a part in as many of the actions as possible.

*5.  Actions should be contests or skills+systems between the two ships.

* I think we agree with this one.

I\'m not sure how much of this we\'ve agreed on, but here\'s what I *think*
the system is...so far.

1.  Initiative contest (Leadership+dice) vs (Leadership+dice)

We are going to use Tactics in movement, so let\'s just use
Leadership for initiative, OK?  
    
Number of Dice:  1 is more simple, but 2 gives a bell curve which is more
realistic..I think.  What do you think?

2.  Movement (Initiative loser goes first, winner goes second)

Ranges:  

Are we going to use them?  I vote yes..for now.  The ranges should be
*extremely* abstract, if the players want to know that the boogie is
"347212 klicks outbound", then they don\'t want RSSC, they want something
BL-like.  If yes, then what ranges?  How do you feel about the ones I
proposed?  (Out of Sensor Range, Out of Range, Long Range, Short Range,
Contact) How about:  Undetected, Detected, Long, Short, Contact?
         
Movement:   A ship may try to change range by one band per turn.
            A ship may attempt to EVADE, MAINTAIN, or CLOSE
            
The Contest:  Tactics (?or 1/2 Pilot?)  + MD6, Tie goes to
                Initiative holder

My reasoning is that the just using the MDrive rating plus skill devalues
the hardware *too* much.  If we say the MDrive number is the number of D6\'s
you roll then it works out better, IMO.  What do you think?
    
BTW, I don\'t think MAINTAIN needs to be contested, so if both sides are
content to maintain the current range the movement part is simply skipped. 
Only if one side (or both) wants to change the range would you have to do
anything with movement.

In your comments you said the Initiative part looks OK, but you didn\'t
mention the movement.  How about that part?

3.  Combat (Initiative winner goes first, loser goes second)

You suggest...

[I *do* wish I had the book! <g>]

1.  We should certainly use the numbers that are generated for the ship by
the SSDS.

2.  We\'d be better off *not* trying to invent something brand new if what
we already have will work.  How complicated does T4 make it?
    
For simplicity could we come up with just Long and Short range, maybe just
pull numbers from 2 of the columns in T4\'s chart (I\'m assuming there\'s a
chart)?

Attacker\'s would add (Gunnery skill)+(Some Weapon Factor)+(Fire Control).

Defender\'s would add (Range:  some # of dice)+(Some Kind of
Skill..here I\'m not sure which ?Gunnery?)+(Some Defensive Weapon Factor)
    
I don\'t think I\'d include Movement factors or Piloting skills here. The
weapons can be abstracted to be so much faster than any of the ships that
neither movement or piloting will help avoid hits.  I *know* that\'s not
really the case for either missiles or beams, but we are trying to make
this simple. <g>
  
>I move we use sensor rules like those in T4 (lock on required before
>you can even attemt to hit, defender can attempt to jam), but

Hum, so you\'re saying...

Attack with Laser, Defense with Sandcaster

1.  Determine Range

2.  Attempt Weapons Lock vs Jam
(SensorSkill+SensorFactor+?Die?) vs (SensorSkill+JamFactor+?Die?)

If lock unsuccessful attack fails

3.  Attempt To Hit with Laser vs Sandcaster
(GunSkill+WeapnFactor+FireCntl) vs (RangeDice+?Skill?+DefenFactor)

If To Hit unsuccessful attack fails

4.  Determine Damage   ???we haven\'t talked about this yet???
 
Is that about it?

Anyway, this is as far as we\'ve gotten, I think. 

Further discussion?

Precisely right.  Not only that, but /good companies of all sorts/ keep 
in touch with their customers.  It is sad that this is so uncommon in 
every industry.  (Keeping in touch with your customers doesn\'t 
automatically make yours a good company...but its a great start.)

As an aside, Hero Games keeps in contact with its fans as well.  I\'ve 
seen messages from them on rec.games.frp.super-heroes numerous times.

Actually, no.  Imperial _citizenship_ is not automatic (see my earlier post).

Protection to a certain extent, yes.  Keeping in mind that waging wars is OK,
incredibly strict legal codes/punishments are OK, and so forth, I can\'t see
the Imperium being too concerned about what happens on-planet.

Now, I _can_ see the Imperium being _very_ concerned about what happens to
its _citizens_.  This is one of the side benefits of citizenship - locals are
safer deporting you than executing you.  This is also a good way to get loyal
soldiers: Joe Hick can sign up with the Marine recruiter, and after a 20-year
hitch in an auxiliary regiment he can return to Podunk with an Imperial
pension (payable in Imperial credits!) and some immunity to the local tyrant.

Simple is good.  I like your philosophy.  However, I want my space combats to
feel different from a dirtside firefight.  Call it a quirk.


Two missing items:

1) No sensors.  One of my favourite parts of BL/BR are the sensor rules. 
Whether you call it "sensor lock" or "target solution", I like the idea of
being able to run stealthy and quiet.  

To simplify sensors, for a small number of ships you can ignore communicator
rules and assume that what one knows all know.  Also, once a sensor lock has
been achieved you can assume it can be maintained, unless circumstances
drastically change (such as the pirate ducking behind an asteroid).

So, I would add a step for getting the first sensor lock.


2) Facing.  I like having different damage depending on facing.  Adds a lot
to the role-playing, too.

A simple way of handling this is to assume:

a) closing range (or pursuing retreating enemy): bow exposed
b) range same: broadside
c) opening range (or running from pursuit): stern exposed

Heh.  So we\'re back to my original (mis-typed) formula, eh?  Mebbe that 
means I think best when I don\'t think. :P  (I knew you were going 
to use tactics for movement. Yeah, that\'s the ticket! [G])

For initiative?  Well, it would depend on how much we want Leadership to 
affect the outcome.  I favor a single die.  But if you think Leadership 
should affect it less, then two dice is fine.  

I guess this would be as good a place as any to discuss our general 
theory of how important skills are going to be in relation to the random 
factor represented by the dice.  Heck, may as well discuss system quality 
vs. random factors and vs. skills as well.  Which is going to be the most 
important?  Which is going to be least important?

Let\'s use ranges (it makes it more interesting, I think, on 
balance (that is, the additional steps involved don\'t outweigh the play 
value added)).  Your first set of terms sounds better than the second, as 
using "detected" and "undetected" may prove confusing if we are to use 
sensors to locate ships.  

If, however, sensors are to be used merely to lock onto a ship to allow 
an attack to take place, then the second set may prove useful (although, 
technically, "Detected" would apply to the last three ranges as well - it 
is more of a binary concept than a gradation).

Alternatively, we could use T4\'s range system which includes Long, Medium, 
Short, and Very Short.

The system is intellectually appealing to me.  It is more playable than 
realistic, but that\'s what RSSC is all about. :)

Why 1/2 Pilot?  Why not just Pilot?  

I like the idea of skill playing large factor.   A person who is highly 
skilled should not be able to use a 1G ship to outmaneuver a lousy pilot 
with a 6G ship very often.  But it should be possible.

I really want to avoid getting too complicated, but here are two 
suggested formulae:

Pilot+Tactics+MD6

Pilot+MD6

Does either of those appeal?  I like the first best, but I worry that 
putting too many terms in the equation will bog the system down.

Makes sense to me.

Other than quibbles over the formula to be used, I like your idea a lot.

Agreed!

Not very.  T4 uses a target number derived from the target\'s size code.  
DM\'s include the target\'s G rating and attacker\'s fire control 
rating, with an optional DM for attacker\'s gunnery skill.  Difficulty 
(ie, the number of dice rolled) is determined by the range, thusly:

V. Short = Average (2D)
Short = Difficult (2.5D)
Medium = Formidable (3D)
Long = Staggering (3.5D)


If we are going to use opposed tasks as our basis, we will need to 
change this, of course.  Otherwise, I think the T4 system will work just 
fine, if we make gunnery skill a standard DM.


> Attacker\'s would add (Gunnery skill)+(Some Weapon Factor)+(Fire Control).

Hmm.  Difficult to come up with a weapon factor.  The factors listed next 
to weapons in the USP are damages at each range (very short, short, 
medium, long).  So, we really shouldn\'t use those.  They should be used 
for damage, as intended.

[snipped]

Well, if we go with T4\'s method, it would be like this:

1.  Attacker tries to lock onto defender (roll for success, based on a 
table look-up based on sensor rating, sensor ops skill, ship size, and range)

2.  If successful, attacker fires at defender (roll for success, based on 
method explained above).

3.  If successful, defender may attempt to decrease damage by launching 
sandcasters.  Roll for success, based on:

Taget Number: 7+(range factor: 0,-1,-2, or -4, from V.Short to Long)
Once again, the difficulty rating is determined by range, using the same 
table as for attack rolls.

If successful, the damage is reduced by one point per successful 
sandcaster hit.

Now that you have a better idea of the attack, defend, and sensor ops 
rules from T4, what do you think?

I\'ve heard good things about Columbia Games and Harn too.

What I heard was that the author and the publisher weren\'t angry, didn\'t
have a falling out, and weren\'t really at odds.  As I heard it the author
didn\'t like some of the things in Harn2, and would provide his own update
on the net.  The publisher, it was reported to me, had no objections.  They
hoped the Harnites would buy Harn2 and download the alternate version and
then use either or both versions.  Is this a fair recount of what\'s going
on?

I\'m with JD on this.  Marc\'s call was for the establishing document ("1,000
words or less"); that\'s the declaration that says, as Les Howie put it, "I\'m
the Emporer; do whatever you were doing before; but don\'t mess with trade."
More detail would appear in subsequent documents.  

There may not even be a formal constitution in a single document, but rather
a series of agreements among Emperor, nobles, and worlds, along with
proclamations and decrees, that give shape to the relationships among the
various parties.  Such development of a "constitutional canon" would allow
for varying interpretations of what these relationships should be, and would
reflect the give-and-take or tug-of-war aspect of forming an empire.  It
would also put the intrigue in right at the get-go, just where players and
referees like it.

1.  Why?  The forces already exist with different names.
2.  The establishment of specific governmental organizations doesn\'t need to
be in the founding document, which should just be a broad-brush overview.
The Emperor\'s power to establish and disband governmental organizations as
necessary and appropriate should be recognized.

I think that this is a bad idea from two perspectives.  First, it\'ll make
visiting Imperial military personnel appear more like occupying forces, even
when they\'re not (when they are actually an occupying force, they may not be
subject to local law, but that\'s mission-specific).  Second, it cuts many
interesting and playable story lines (although it probably creates others).

I think you\'re right on the background, but the royal we is such an old
Terran custom that the nobility, at least, would be expecting it (and it\'s
surely still in the holovids or whatever they watch).

We\'ve come up with a system based on a skill vs. skill contest, with 
sensor quality and range thrown in.  Take a look at the posts from Monday

Hmm.  Interesting.  If facing affects damage, and if the damage done is 
the value given next to the weapon on the USP (ie, it might be Laser 
2,1,1,0, which would mean that at Very Short range it would do 2 points, 
at Short range 1 point, at Medium range 1 point, and at Long range it 
would do no damage), what method would you suggest be used to 
increase/decrease that damage based on facing?  (ie, bow = normal 
damage, broadside= 2x damage, etc?)

I don\'t think I can compete with all the very elaborate
documents that have been proposed, but a couple comments:

The document is primarily a marketing document, as some people
have mentioned. It outlines what\'s going on, why and it
provides a basis of legitimacy. It should not specify detail,
so things like "a planet and its space out to 100 diameters"
are way to detailed. It should be something like this:

I am the Emperor.

I have plenty of reasons to be Emperor.
One of these is the Moot which I\'ve reconvened.

The Sylean Federation is now the Restored Empire.

All sentient residents of Imerial space are Imperial
Citizens.

(Adding \'residents\' fixes that Zhodani tour group problem :)

Don\'t impede Free Trade.

I have ultimate authority and all Imperial Bodies
act through my decree.

The details will be specified later, in much bigger
documents which won\'t be on the front page of the
news but will be sent to all worlds and nobles in no
uncertain terms. Much of Imperial law probably extends
from Sylean law, so in the short term, it\'s a minor change.

Also, on robots:

I don\'t think sentient AIs existed in Year 0... my copy
of Robots is packed pending a move to Toronto, but when
were the Shudsusham (sp??) concords held... ?

I doubt that the Sylean federation had enough economic
or technological might to have a lot of robots in Year 0...

emporer.  I have gone back and did some quick research on emporers.  I found 
most emporers, kings, dictators, or whatever else you want to call them are 
rarely all powerful.  A couple of examples: King John I of England had to sign 
the Magna Carta; King Edward III of England initially contended with his 
barons;  Hugh Capet, first king of France was elected by the other nobles.  I 
know what you are thinking, they weren\'t emperors.  Well, how about Napoleon?  
He didn\'t have nobility to worry about (French revolution took care of that), 
but it took several years for even him to consolidate power.  Even when he had 
conquered Europe, he had to worry about the politicians in Paris.  Hitler is 
another example, though not an emperor, he ended up being all powerful in the 
Third Reich.  It took years for him to raise to power.  During the period he had 
to play off rivals (or kill them) and foreign governments.

It is great to say the emperor will do this or do that.  In reality, it takes 
years, sometimes generations to solidify a dynasty.  The Pharoahs of Eqypt 
became "all powerful" in Eqypt, but not initially.  I am not an expert in 
eastern history, so I cannot talk about the Emperors of China nor Japan.  
However, I would venture to guess that it was similar to their western 
counterparts.

Why would you think that Cleon would be any different?  In fact, why would you 
want him to be?  Glenn Goffin said it best when he said the rivalry between the 
Emperor and the nobles is just how the players and referees would want it.  
Think about the adventure plot lines that a rivalry brings out.

If two ships are currently at Short Range, can one ship attempt to close   
to Contact range (for the purpose of boarding) while the other still has   
a functional Manuever Drive?

I could possible believe this if we are talking about two very large   
cruisers, who rely more heavily upon firepower than agility.  But if this   
combat taking place between two smaller ships (like a pair of Millenium   
Falcon-type ships), I don\'t really see one being able to board the other   
until they disable their opponent\'s Maneuver Drives.  And at that point,   
I don\'t see how the boardee could prevent the other from boarding.

Someone care to clarify?

Actually it should...  The Moot NEVER denied the succession of a 
legitimate heir to the throne.  Cleon II abdicated, a few years 
after ascending the throne, and a couple of Emperors abdicated in 
later years...  The few times that it stepped in were all in cases 
where there was not a direct descendant, and there was more than 1 
candidate for succession.  Even then, it was often unsuccessful in 
advancing a particular claimant to the throne.  The Moot was pretty 
much a worthless debating society.  Some of its members would be 
powerful in their own right (particularly the Archdukes).  The Moot 
might be more powerful in the early years, but even then, it didn\'t 
exercise its powers a whole lot...

No, they wouldn\'t have.  Not at TL 12 Maximum, anyways...

The Shadusham Accords occurred during the Sylean Federation, so they

Sure it would. It is an Empire, not a representative democracy.  Apples

	to cite just two sentence :

	    " One of my favourite parts of BL/BR are the sensor rules. "

	and " Adds a lot to the role-playing, too. "

	There are two kinds of space dog fight, conflict simulation
	and role playing. And as a game master I need both. Of course
	I need role playing more often.

	My role playing space combat system is as simplified as the
	players want it !

	The main difference between both: As a refree, I\'m in charge
	not the rules are in charge. Its not sense of the rules to
	make the game, but my imagination has to make the game, the
	rules can give me clues.

	So here comes my simplyfied rules :

	- alway leave the players incertain, if the what the sensors
	  show, is whats realy around.
	- look at the clock, remember most wepons fire all 3 minutes,
	  this makes interaction between players straigt, and force
	  the fealing of a dog fight.
	- make a hard time, but dont kill them.

	BL/BR: I need these rules sometimes for roleplaying games :

	Some month ago the players where on board of mother (a Midu-Aga)
	not to solve the Vampire Fleet scenario but to invite a second
	game master, and we played for a bottle of uyskee if he can kill
	them. Of I\'ve told the players that, there is a bottle, and that
	they have to be quite, so he did\'nt know on what ship of the
	fleet the players are.

	The role playing aspect of this amasing hour was, that the players
	feel hopeless, and that they will do all to get from board as
	soon as posible.

First, the list has run on ns.mpgn.com ever since we switched to majordomo a
while back.  The weekend of the 11th of August (I think) we lost ns to a cpu
failure.  This was a DecStation 5000 running Ultrix 4.4.  To get our name
server (which was the key role of this machine) back on line, I grabbed the
one machine I had avaialble, which was a Dec Alpha running OSF 1.3.  I
copied all the majordomo stuff from the drives on the 5000 to the Alpha and
brought the list back up.  Now that history is past us:

The messages coming from ns.mpgn.com instead of mpgn.com are probably some
sendmail configuation difference between the two machines.  I will try to
get this fixed in the near future, but it is a pretty low priority.

The Mime-headers seem to have gone away.  Personally I like this.  I use Elm
from home and it doesn\'t like Mime-messages very well.  Any reason to go
back to them?

I have gotten a lot of returned mail, but they all seem to be ligitamate
bounces, mail boxes full, user unknown, etc.  I just went through most of
TML and removed the bounces I have been getting.  I will try to get to Xboat
later today.

As far as the anonymous remailer bounces you are seeing, can someone forward
me a copy and I will try to track down the source of the bounce. (a
difficult task no doubt)

Any way, I would like to appoligize for the recent problems.  Its not my
fault that that 5000 had to go conk out on me :-)

Tom\'s reply:

Sure it would. It is an Empire, not a representative democracy.  Apples
and oranges.  Imperial liabilities and immunities would be carved
somewhere on some rock.

My response:

If the Empire was an occupation force you\'re right.  I can think of several 
examples; Germany and Japan WWII,  Stalinist Russia, U.S. during 1800\'s Indian 
Wars, and Ghengis Kahn.  If the Empire wants worlds to be active participants in 
the Empire as full member worlds you\'re wrong.  The Empire must allow the worlds 
to exercise their own legal systems.  Napoleon did this during the Napoleonic 
Wars, 1800-1815, when he set up the client states (Kingdom of Italy, 
Confederation of the Rhine, etc.).  The client states had their own laws (yes, I 
know they were very similar to the French laws, just as many worlds will 
mirror Imperium law).  French soldiers breaking laws in Italy *could* face 
Italian law.  It happened twice that I know: an assassin who tried to kill Murat 
(King of Naples) and a French soldier caught stealing Prince Eugene\'s (King of 
Italy) horse.

The only hard exception were the following: The Emperor, the Royal Family, Royal 
Aides de Camp, Marshalls of the Empire.  Did the military take care of most of 
the punishment of soldiers?  Yes!  The military had (has) stricter rules and 
stiffer penalties.

Be careful not to make the Imperium into the evil empire of Star Wars.  In war 
zone and areas under martial law, the military answers to itself.  In other 
areas it is a different matter.

Well, FF&S contradicts some 15 years of prior cannon... Special Supplement
_: Missiles (Either #2 or #3) clearly delineates missile types, and nukes
are NOT the standard... previous cannon seems to have been flechette
warheads or BB warheads, ala the US Sidewinder... get close and pepper him
with shrapnel. Not having designed these for FF&S, I don\'t know how
feasable they really are, but they are cannonical, as Missiles says that
the warheads are not normally direct impact missiles (which did more damage
than normal missiles). I Have designed many missiles using SS_:Missiles.

I still believe firmly that the Imperium\'s military would not answer to
local authorities UNLESS the local military commander decreed it so.  This
means that they are *not* automatically bound by local laws, and probably
(as you point out below) would *rather* face local laws than (often harsh)
military justice.

We will have to agree to disagree on this one.  Neither of use are talking
about absolutes, but I do disagree that there would ever be a case where
local law automatically applied to Imperial military units (on duty that
is).

This is the case for TNE/FFS.  There has been a lot of work on
non-nuke missiles but the problem is that at typical traveller
velocities kinetic energy is nastier than most nukes (and all other
explosives).

Not to drag out rock throwing again (well, only a little :-) but I
think that the Rules of War sghould be written much more broadly
than an anti-nuke prohibition.

Along the lines of "Use of weapons of mass/indescriminate
destruction are prohibited."  Thgis would cover nukes, "rocks",
chemical, an biological weapons used against population centers, and
all but rocks vs. military targets (rocks being Ortilery since KE
far exceeds explosive force for any orbital attacks).

Yeah, but you gotta think that the Imperium is going to deal with its 
own renegades...  

There should be no mention of immunity for anybody but Cleon I in a 
founding proclamation though.  The Imperium, as someone else said, is 
not going to conquer known space by tying both hands behind its 
back...

Yes, it would probably be a case of just changing a few insignias 
of the Sylean Federation military, with the battleship 
\'Federation\' being renamed battleship \'Cleon\'. Though one of the 
first things the Empreror would declare would be that he was  
Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the Imperium -- with 
some nice titles to go with it, like Grand High Admiral of the 
Massed Fleets, or similar.

At least two documents..  I always figured that the laws of the Imperium were
more like English Common Law than American Constitutional Law, in that certain 
things are so "because they have always been that way".  This would go a long
way to explain the hodge-podge of odd government types and seemingly incongruous
institutions that make up the Imperium.

Precisely - the higher ranking lords of the Sylean Federation agreed to support
Cleon in pressing his claim to the Imperial throne, and he in return agreed
to confirm them in their traditional titles and priveleges.

>The proclamation may have been issued in Year 0 or before.

I would say it was issued in what became year 0, but which had a Solomani
style date before.  A year or two later, a new Imperial dating system was
introduced which retroactively (by a year or two) set year 0 as the 
date of Cleon\'s assumption of the Imperial title.

I don\'t really see there ever being a Constitution as such - more a series of
compromises with various factions that established certain precedents for 
interstellar relations.  For example, Noble A brings Noble B appeals to the 
Imperial Court over Noble B\'s imposition of heavy tariffs on goods from 
Noble A\'s planet.  Cleon hears the case and says, essentially, that tradition
and the will of the Emporer state that only the Empire has the right to tax
interstellar trade.  In another example, a planet which has a no native 
aristocracy receives a noble as the Imperial Legate.  While there, the Imperial 
legate, with the help of a group of local pro-aristocrats, (and with Cleon\'s
secret agreement) attempts a coup. The original government appeals to Cleon 
based on their traditional right to self-determination, a right which dates to
the 1st Imperium and has been respected by every intervening Emporer.  Faced
with this weighty tradition, Cleon orders the Imperial Legate and his TL 12 
Battle-Dress equipped personal retinue recalled to Sylea.  Imperial will is 
thwarted by tradition.

>By seperating the two documents, I think we enrich Imperium history and weave

Exactly my point.  The give and take of establishing rights and precedents is
creates an environment rich in gaming opportunities.

And Nicholas Law wrote..

Exactly the problem with the Constitutional approach.

Except that tradition forces him to accept certain limitations - and 
Cleon is VERY cautious with respect to tradition, since tradition
is the very basis of his claim to the title

>But the power of the Moot to reject an heir to the Iridium Throne 
>should not be taken lightly...(stuff clipped). 

That would also be the chance for the Moot to reclaim powers that waned
under the waxing power of he previous Emporer.

The change from a Federal form of government to a Monarchial government is a
pretty drastic change, especially when you consider that the Emporer is closer
to a Louis XIV style monarch than a Queen Victoria.  I always figured that 
the 2nd Imperium used the Roman and Alexandrian Empires as models: Like Caesar,
Estigibarra (sp) was never officially crowned Emporer, but he was the start 
of the dynasty.  Like Alexander, Estigibarra assumed the Imperial role to 
better rule the subject states - there are more likenesses.  The foundation 
of the 3rd Imperium is more along the lines of the Charlemagne\'s assumption of
the Imperial title - it came after a "dark ages", the title had lapsed, etc., so
I modeled Cleon\'s \'aclammatio\' after Charlemagne\'s.  In Cleon\'s case, the 
Moot plays the part of the Pope, and by giving legitimacy to Cleon\'s claim, claim
the right to control the Imperial title.

I don\'t see how a written Imperial constitution would come into being after the 
Long Night.  The Imperial title had lapsed, and the worlds of Core were joined 
in a federation which presumeably had some type of central representative
authority, and in which the central government was more powerful than the 
individual member governments.  To move directly to an Imperial form of 
government, and one that gave the individual worlds a great deal of autonomy, 
means that the existing Federation government was willing to essentially disolve
itself in favor of Cleon - which seems unlikely to me.  The only way I can see 
an Imperial constitution developing would be as the result of conflict between 
two equally powerful foes. Given the decription of Cleon\'s aggressive
consolidation of power, I can\'t see him getting as far as being made Emporer and
then saying, "Ok, now I will limit my powers like mad with a written document".
If the powers will still that equal, I can\'t imagine either side would see the
fight as over.

So here we have Lord Cleon of Sylea, a prominent noble on Sylea, a wealthy 
industrialist in his own right, leading a traditionalist faction in the 
Federation Moot.  This faction presses for a return to the old Imperial 
government (the good old days), and gathers support among the local nobles
who\'s local autonomy is being squeezed by the ever-centralizing Federation.
Cleon is a prominent figure in the Federation government, having led the 
consolidation of Core.  His wealth and patronage are very persuasive, and his
industrial holdings can sway planetary economies.  In short, he can build a 
group of disparate supporters who will back him.  Cleon waits for some sort
of government crisis - perhaps an attempted rebellion by a Federation world, 
or perhaps he even manufactures it.  The factionalized Federation government 
is not able to deal with the crisis.  Cleon steps in, solves the problem, and
returns to Sylea where he is "spontaneously" acclaimed Emporer by his supporters
in the moot.  Promises are exchanged, and Cleon assumes the Iridium Throne.

This puts us at year 0 - in a situation pregnant with possibility.  People will 
be seeing conspiracy around every corner: Federalist on Shudusham are planning
a revolt; Imperial Guards are arresting Federal sympathizers; factions in the 
Moot are planning to depose Cleon - the possibilities are endless.  And what
about the newly conquered worlds of Core.  Do they all REALLY get to keep their
own governments?  What about the worlds that Cleon captured and occupied?
Can he enfeoff his a Marquis or a Count with a whole world?  What about the 
democracy\'s that are part of the new territories?  Will Cleon confirm their
independent rights (like Frederick I with the Italian city-states) or will 
he attempt to place a noble in charge?

It just seems to me that if you want a setting with room to adventure, don\'t 
give it a nice new constitution that spells out everyone\'s roles.  Give them 
a loose framework and plenty of rope to hang themselves.

Let them fight for a constitution to limit Cleon-don\'t just hand it to them.

Four reasons:
1. Its a good place to give their new names.
2. It is a veiled threat against internal and external enemies.
3. Although we like to think the military is not part of the political
process, that is not the case in most governments.  Especially autocracies.
I think Cleon would want to be very particular about who controls the navy.
4. It seems proper to mention the most important instrument of Imperial
power.  There would be no empire without the navy.  Can it really be ignored
in the founding document?  Kings, Tsars, Kaisers and the like were always
prancing around in uniforms because they knew, just as Mao did, where power
comes from.

>2.  The establishment of specific governmental organizations doesn\'t need to

I generally agree about the broad brush, but think we should try to provide
as much useful information as possible for roleplayers and their referees.
A few nuts and bolts (Who is a citizen?  What are Imperial crimes?) along
with some vague guidelines (free trade; autonomy of member worlds), allowing
referees a great deal of discretion but providing some canonical guidance,
would be most helpful for playing the game.

My proposal was a little broad.  Amend it to read:  Imperial Justice shall
have exclusive jurisdiction over all legal actions against Imperial officers.

You obey those who have power over you.  If officers are subject to local
courts and therefore politicos, they may have divided loyalties.  The reason
for giving nobles access to Imperial Justice also applies to military
officers.  It assures their complete loyalty, and that would be everything
to our aspiring autocrat.

        Actually, it\'s canon that it WASN\'T in the original charter, as a

        Well, you can use your fuel either for the jump drives or for the
HEPlaR. In normal operations (i.e. not running away from anybody) you
shouldn\'t use all that much maneuver fuel -- a few g-turns to leisurely
coast out to 100 diameters, jump, then move in from 100 diameters. Use CG
for landings, etc.

I see your point.  I\'d say yes, they ship can close to Contact range. 
OTOH, maybe boarding shouldn\'t be allowed until you disable the other
ship\'s MDrive.  I guess they would pound on each other until one was able
to break off, or one had their drive knocked out.

Now, for a totally different take on this!  <g> None of us know how the
Thrusters really work, right?  So maybe when one Thruster field gets close
enough to another they can be locked together allowing for boarding.  That
kind of effect has been used often enough in SF literature. <g>

PHYSICAL APPEARANCE:

Helios consists of one major continent and four smaller ones.  In addition,
there are a number of major islands and a few archipelagoes.  The Main
community of Helios is located on a small island in the southern hemisphere
in the temperate zone.

Weather:
Because of its location close to its sun, Helios has a wide range of
climates.  Remarkably, though, Helios is nearly void of any types of violent
weather.  Helios weather is relatively calm with a few exceptions, most
notably in the temperate zones during the end of the summer month.  The
rapid change in temperatures throughout the polar and temperate  regions
usually brings about a couple of small storms a year.  Occasionally one of
these storms will brew into a major storm, but rarely does the storm last
more than four or five days.

The band around the equator represents Helios\' only semi-constant
temperature zone.  Most of the land area in this range (2 bands) is either
desert or arid plains.  Any activity in these areas during the daylight
hours is hazardous as the temperature rarely drops below 40deg C (104deg F).
This central range band is termed the "equatorial zone."

During the summer month, this "daylight danger" band extends through most of
the temperate zone and includes 5 more range bands for a total of 7 bands
from the equator.  This zone (these 5 range bands) is termed the "temperate
zone."  During the winter, this zone is considered the main temperate zone
because the temperature ranges from 29deg (85deg F)closest to the equator to
- -10deg C (13deg F)nearest the polar zone.

The area on either pole is covered by a seasonal ice cap.  Due to the
extreme axial tilt, the ice cap extends out from the poles nearly 4 range
bands.  The fringes of these polar caps are very thin, and usually only
occur at night. The shortness of Helios\' rotational period prevents the
formation of any thick ice caps, but during the short winter month, the
polar area can be quite treacherous to navigation.  The temperature in this
band ranges from 31deg C (88deg F)during the summer on the fringe to -31deg
C (-24deg F) at the polar cap during the middle of winter.  This zone is
known as the polar zone.

 Flora and Fauna:
Most of the native wildlife and plant life of Helios is typical of most
habitable worlds with a few exceptions.

Saltad:
Much of the land in the temperate zone is forest land covered by a tree
native to Helios.  The rumors as to the origin of Helios\' original name,
Willow, trace back to early Solomani settlers finding these trees and
mistaking them for Terran Willow tree.  The difference between the two trees
was no doubt soon discovered as the Helios "willow\'s" wood is as hard as
some metals.  Early in Helios history (see, History), the wood of this tree
was coveted by the nobles of the Sarid Subsectors, as well as those of other
nearby Subsectors.  Many artisans made a fortune on Willow wood carvings.
The tree, officially known as the Saltad, is still in plenteous supply on
Helios, and the citizens of Helios are still involved in selling hand carved
trinkets.  More recently, a few of the more extravagantly wealthy citizens
of the Coalition have commissioned hand carved furniture from the artisans
of Helios.  These items are quickly becoming a status symbol of wealth in
the Coalition.

Whiskey Bug:
Perhaps the only known predator to the Saltad is the Gyrnius Celaecun, or
the Whiskey Bug.  The Whiskey Bug is a small flying insect that grows to
approximately 5 centimeters long.  The Whiskey Bug resembles the Terran
Beetle in shape and size, however its color is a reddish brown, not the
characteristic black of the Terran Beetle.  The Whisky Bug uses pollen from
the flowers native to Helios to create a fermented "nectar" that it then
uses to break down the wood of the Saltad tree.  During the early spring,
when sprouts emerge from the strong Saltad tree\'s trunk, adult Whiskey Bugs
will burrow through the soft sprout spots to the very heart of the tree.
There they will extract the soft heartwood that is the very life of the
Saltad tree.  In the harder, outer wood, Whiskey Bugs carve small chambers
called "vats" in which the masticated and moistened heartwood is deposited.
Finally, a dose of bacteria, from a special pouch inside the Whiskey Bug\'s
mouth is added to the mix, and the chamber is sealed up.  Inside, the
bacteria soften and partially metabolize the heartwood, using enzymes and an
organic acid. This mixture is known as the "sour mash," which indicates part
of the origin for the beetle\'s name.  After a few days, the beetles re-open
the vat chamber and consume the now-edible sour mash.  The youngest beetles
feed the pupae by carrying them from vat to vat, as the vats are opened.
The bacteria metabolize the mash anaerobically and produce alchol
by-products which remain in the mash.  Anyone attempting to drink the alchol
run-off of mash produced in the wild would likely go blind or die because it
is mostly methyl alchohol.  Some Heliosans are keepers of these bugs.  Under
carefully controlled conditions, the sour mash will produce almost all
ethanol, with the remaining methanol being removed before bottling.
Heliosan Whisky Bug Juice is known for its sour-sweet taste and powerful
kick.  Before the Collapse it was made by many moonshiners on the main
continent, and carefully inspected brands were popular throughout the
subsector.  In the New Era, not many of Helios\' inhabitants are inclined to
produce hard alchohol, but visitors to the weekly Auction may have the
opportunity to sample it.  Some visitors have been impressed with the drink
and they occasionally export it small quantities, either for personal
consumption or resale.

      Weight:     0.1 kg     Weapon:     Poison/Stinger(As Armed Melee)

      Armor:      1/2        Range:      Short

Felden:
The natural enemy of the Whisky Bug is the Felden.  The Felden is a small
animal that lives in the rotted shells of Saltad trees that Whisky bugs
leave behind.  Similar to the Terran anteater, the Felden has a long snout
that it uses to reach into the hollow center of the Saltad tree and eat the
Whisky Bugs.  Felden are slow stupid creatures that do little more for
Helios than keep the Whisky Bug population in check.  The Felden is nearly
blind and can actually hear the high pitched resonance sounds the Whisky
bugs use to converse with one another.  While the meat of the Felden can be
eaten, there is very little that is easily gotten and it is very tough and
bland.
   Omnivore, Gatherer  (F8-A3-S2/4/8)
      Weight:     3 kg       Weapon:     Claws(As Armed Melee)

      Initiative: 1          Damage/Pen: 1D6/Nil
      Armor:      1          Range:      Short

Grupami:
The Grupami is a fish native to the coastal waters in the temperate zone
during the winter month.  During the summer month, the Grupami migrate to
more temperate waters in the polar zone, but each winter they return to the
temperate zone.  There is little about the Grupami that is spectacular.  It
serves as one of the major sources of food for the inhabitants of Helios.
The only distinguishing feature of the Grupami occurs at the beginning and
ending of both the winter and summer month, when Helios experiences its
equinox.  At this time, the Grupami begin their migration to and from the
polar zone, and when they begin to migrate, they swim faster by jumping out
of the water (similar to Terran flying fish).  What makes this event so
spectacular is that the scales of the Grupami are made of a reflective base
with a crystalline covering.  As the Grupami jump out of the water, the
sunlight is reflected of the base of the scale and refracted through the
crystalline covering creating a "rainbow trail" that arcs with the jumping
pattern of the fish.  This phenomenon is best viewed in the last few hours
before sunset, or the first few hours after sunrise.
   Herbivore, Grazer  (F20-A*-S10/20/40) (A* - Never Attacks)
      Weight:     1 kg       Weapon:     None
      Hits:       1          To Hit:     N/A
      Initiative: 1          Damage/Pen: N/A
      Armor:      0          Range:      N/A


Parinklo:
Another animal native to the waters of Helios is the Parinklo.  Similar to
the Terran Tiger shark, the Parinklo is a saltwater mammal that grows to
nearly 3 meters in length.  The Parinklo is an extremely agile sea creature
and is considered the most dangerous predator on Helios.  Parinklo, like the
Terran sharks they resemble,  travel in groups of four or more called
regalia.  A single Parinklo has been known to sever the leg of an unwary
swimmer with is vice-like jaws and triple rows of teeth.  In addition to the
danger presented by the Parinklo\'s teeth, the creature has two tentacles
located just behind the pectoral fins that stabilize the creature.  Each of
these tentacles is tipped with poisonous barbs.  When hunting, the Parinklo
will bring itself close to its prey and wrap its poisonous barbs around it.
The poison is a quick acting muscle relaxant that serves to render the prey
motionless while the regalia divide the meal between themselves.
   Carnivore, Killer  (F2-A18-S20/40/80)
      Weight:     50 kg      Weapon:     Poison/Tentacle(As Grapple)
      Hits:       16         To Hit:     18
      Initiative: 6          Damage/Pen: 1p*/Nil (* - See Note)
      Armor:      1/2        Range:      Long
      Weapon:     Teeth(As Armed Melee)
      To Hit:     5          Note:  Poison renders victim motionless in 1D6
      Damage/Pen: 5D6/1/2      turns.  If grapple holds till then, Parinklo 
      Range:      Short        will attack with teeth.


Mineral Content:
While there have never been radioactive deposits found on Helios, the world
was once a world rich in fossil fuels.  Before the collapse, many of the
mineral resources of the planet were mined and taken away by the prospector
in for a quick buck.  Helios now has a good supply of fossil fuels as well
as some decent mineral deposits.  While iron ore is readily available, much
of Helios\' imports consist of other minerals necessary for their society.

Extended System:
Helios occupies the first orbit, orbit zero, around Zenith, the systems K6 V
star.  Because of the size of the star, and Helios\' proximity to it, travel
to and from Helios is somewhat difficult.  Ships arriving in the system find
that the 100-diameter limit imposed on them by their jump drive leaves them
somewhere around the number two orbit, days from Helios.  Fortunately, this
second orbit is a planetoid belt filled with icy bodies, and many unprepared
starfarers find themselves filling their fuel tanks with the ice of these
ice planetoids.  Orbit one is occupied by a single small planetoid.  The
outer orbits are also filled with other planets, but Helios has yet to begin
to explore the potential resources of these planets.

    'body' => 'HISTORY

The earliest known references to Helios are in the Imperial archives
discovered on Sarid (Oriflamme 1532) in the subsector capital records
building.  According to the reference, in 532 a group of Solomani Settlers
landed on Willow (as Helios was then known) to attempt repairs to their Jump
drive.  Finding Willow a pleasant planet, they decided to stay.  The Saltad
trees that covered the land masses of the planet reminded the settlers of
willow trees on their Terran home, and they named the planet after the
willow tree.

Willow is not mentioned in the archives again until 736.  By this time,
Willow had become a hiding spot for all sorts of Imperial criminals and riff
raff.  Willow\'s position within the 100-diameter limit of Zenith, her star,
made travel between the planet and the jump point long.  This fact along
with the lack of gas giants in the system made travel to Willow difficult.
Only those with a reason to "get lost" settled on Willow.  Many criminals
had "retired" on Willow when they felt the law brushing close to their
heels.  Tracking a criminal was not only expensive because of the in-system
travel requirements, but it was also hampered by the lack of settlers.  As a
result, only the most sought after criminalswere tracked to Willow.

Criminals were not the only settlers who found their way to Willow.  Many
others found their way to the backwater planet including malcontents,
debtors, jilted lovers, and anti-Imperial extremists.  No solid government
was formed, and very few of the settlers even lived in the small villages
that were formed.

Many of the settlers had taken up carving the wood of the Saltad tree native
to Willow.  The wood of the Saltad tree resembles ivory.  The wood is very
hard even when the tree is alive, but when the wood is dead and cured
properly, it becomes nearly hard as plate steel. Saltad wood carvings became
status symbol among the nobility of the Sarid subsector.  Willow was
occasionally visited by traders who would stop at the planet and trade their
goods for the Saltad wood carvings.

By the mid 700\'s the Saltad wood carvings done by the people of Willow were
claiming prices of 5000 to 10000 Cr in the markets of Sarid.  Willow had
become a regular stop for a few of the Free Traders roaming the Sarid
Subsector, but the real history of Willow begins almost a sector away on a
small world in the Promise sector named Amoy.

In 740, a boy was born, on Amoy, to a construction worker and his wife.  The
child, Garaath, it would be discovered, was a powerful psion.  When he was
40, in 780, Garaath had visions of angry mobs and violence.  During the
course of the next five years, he had more visions, and by 785, Garaath
understood what he had seen coming, the Psionic Supressions of 800.

Garaath had a staunch belief that, if he showed kindness to others, they
would be obligated by their nature to return this kindness.  He referred to
this as the Eternal Circle.  During the 15 years between Garaath\'s
premonition and the Psionic Supressions, Garaath began recording his beliefs
and sharing them with others.  Slowly Garaath gained a religious following,
but when the Psionic Supressions erupted, this small group was not enough to
protect Garaath from the attack of anti-psionic mobs.  The story here is
somewhat fuzzy.  Some records state that Garaath was killed by the attacks,
while others state that he placed himself in a state of suspended animation.
All accounts agree, however, that Garaath was never seen again.  

The Church of Brotherly Kindness                  

        The religion, the Church of Brotherly Kindness, nearly died out, and
without its a core group of believers, it would have.  The small group of
believers slowly recovered from their defeat and quickly developed an active
mission program.  The writings of Garaath were collected and published as
the Words of Kindness.  Many others joined the faith, and by 1100, the
church had more than 1,000,000 members.  A small branch of the church
developed in the Sarid subsector, but the group floundered under heavy
persecution.  In early 1103, citing religious persecution, this small group
petitioned the Duke of Sarid for some land where the group could settle.
The duke granted the petition and gave the church a small island in the
southern hemisphere of Willow.  The church was able to set up a small self
sufficient community, and, excluding a few minor incidents, the rest of the
world tended to leave them alone.

The Final War & Collapse

	When Virus swept through the subsector, it did not ignore Willow.  An
infected passenger liner came to the world seeking refuge from the chaos
that was sweeping the subsector, but it brought that chaos with it.  Most of
the malcontents, and the settlement on the main continent started to fight
over the remaining  food and high tech devices.  The CBK had very few high
tech devices and was left alone.  It is believed that the rest of the
inhabitants died once the automated farm equipment stopped working, but no
one has made a complete survey of the world.  So it is possible a few
families have survived till the present.

The Final War and resulting Collapse devastated the universal CBK, and the
only known surviving group is the group that settled on Willow.  Virus also
hit the island of the CBK; however, the people there were a community, and
when they realized that their high tech devices were no longer functioning
properly, they simply resolved to go without high tech help.  They turned
off and destroyed all their high tech equipment, and started to relearn the
old ways.  It was not easy and was not without casualties, but by pulling
together, and helping each other the CBK was able to survive with minimal
loss of life.

The New Era

After a decade of struggle, the CBK had stabilized at technological level of
four.  Most people were involved in farming, but some parts of the community
manufactured the tools necessary to survive.  The population was too small
to set up massive assembly line factories.  Instead most  manufacturing is
done in small workshops, with most of the work done by hand.  These
workshops still survive today, and one of the exports Helios has, is
hand-crafted steam powered automobiles.  These are especially popular with
Luhtalans.

In 1196, an Oriflammi survey ship came to Willow to assess the planet\'s
capacity for colonization.  At first the survey went very well, the planet
had plenty of untapped potential, and several high tech devices were
discovered on the main continent.  Then the ship found the CBK community.
This distressed the Technarchs, because any native population would have
control over the planet\'s destiny.  The Technarch\'s debated whether they
could destroy the settlement, and claim the planet was uninhabited.  Before
a decision could be made, the news was leaked to the rest of the Dawn
League. The League quickly launched a recontact mission to establish
relations with the new community.  The CBK was delighted to learn that
others had survived the Collapse, and upon learning of Dawn League and its
mission to rebuild civilization, they petitioned for admission.

After a few  months of discussion, on XI-11-1196, Willow was admitted to the
League. The Oriflammi strongly protested this, Willow only had 700
residents, if they were given full voting rights, each resident of Willow
would have the same voting rights as 14,300 citizens of Oriflamme.  But the
Federalist block sensed an ally in Helios, and also wanted to penalize the
Technarchs for even contemplating destroying a new found community.
Following the tradition of several other worlds, the CBK renamed their
planet Helios, after an ancient sun god.  

Since being admitted, Helios has decided to help outfit expeditions into the
Wilds to uplift the devastated worlds out there. They have also been a burr
in the Oriflammen sides.  There are several reasons for this.  Mainly, they
are a bit annoyed that the Technarchs thought about destroying them.  They
also disagree with the basic philosophy of the government of Oriflamme.
Finally, it amuses the fun-loving Heliosians when the Oriflammen get so
flustered when their plans are upset.


CULTURE

Even though Helios has one of the lowest tech levels in the  Coalition, the
Helosians do not have a great desire to acquire better technology.  Sure a
TL-12 toaster oven would be nice and would improve the quality of life, but
the effort required to produce TL-12 toasters could better be spent helping
the people in the Wilds.  The residents can see the benefits of technology;
it\'s just that it\'s not a high priority.  The improvement of people\'s lives
is a worthy goal, not the improvement of material things.

Religion has a deep and broad background on Helios, but the way the
Heliosians live it is very practical.   They follow a principle known as
"Life Style Evangelicalism."  The idea is to live your life in such a  way
that others see how different you are, and want to know more about what
makes you different.  This gives you the opportunity to tell them about your
religion.  About 80% of the population attend church services regularly, but
they feel no ill will towards the other 20%.  All of them have been  raised
in the same town, and they all went to the same school.  They all have
pretty much the same values; some just do not feel a need to attend church
services.

There are only 700 citizens of Helios.  During the first year of their
membership in the RC, they realized that they needed an immigration policy.
If they allowed unlimited immigration, the Oriflamme Technarchs would simply
ship in 10,000 colonists, and Helios would become a de facto Oriflamme
colony. On the other hand, Helios is a nice planet, and it would be a sin to
allow it to go uninhabited.  So the residents decided to allow immigration,
but a  potential immigrant would need to get permission to immigrate from a
two-thirds  majority of the native population.  Once she has this
permission, she is a full citizen of Helios.  A potential immigrant is
supposed to make appointments with various families and arrange to meet.
Usually these meetings take place over dinner.  The potential immigrant and
the family converse about life on Helios, and what the immigrant would bring
to the community.  After the immigrant has talked to most of the people on
the planet, a meeting is held, and the citizens vote on whether or not the
immigrant should be allowed to  become a citizen.  These meetings are
usually held at Festival. (See Below)

Helios holds an Auction each week, on the first day of the week.  The
government does not take a host cut.  This is mainly to siphon off trade
from nearby Oriflamme.  It\'s just another way the Heliosians can annoy their
rival neighbor, the Oriflammen.  Most of the goods sold at Helios\' Auction
are big ticket items; smaller items go on to Oriflamme.  The savings on
smaller items is not usually enough to warrant taking the cargo to Helios.
Helios benefits from this because the big ticket items tend to bring more
people visiting for the Auction, and these visitors spend credits visiting
the Festival.

The Heliosians hold their Festival at the same time as the Auction. Here
they gather to discuss matters affecting the community and to celebrate.
Each family sends one member to the weekly meeting, where any issues
affecting the community are decided.  These include electing the
representative to the Assembly of Worlds, deciding on trade issues, voting
on immigrants, and where to send the next Wild relief mission.  Festival is
also a time for fun; there are many carnival style rides and amusements.
Farmers from the outer reaches of the  island come and sell their goods, and
children show off their art projects from school.  The visiting auction
goers are encouraged to take part and have fun. They often wind up buying
hand-crafted trinkets and furniture.  Heliosian furniture is carved from the
Saltad wood and is quite stylish and rather popular.  


POLITICS

Helios is a representative democracy.  Each adult is granted one vote, but
often, voting is done by one member of the family for the entire family.  A
youth is considered an adult on his 17th birthday, but may attend voting
sessions at Festival when he is 15.

Helios has three elected officials. The Assembly representative, which
currently is Currun Nealgu, an elderly gentleman with a wicked sense of
humor. There is also Wes Guguan, the planet sheriff.  He does not have much
to do.  The most crime he has to fight is the occasional off worlder who
has had too much to drink.  If there was ever any emergency, he has the
power to deputize available citizens.  Finally, Lizi Neaftu is the starport
administrator. The  starport is not much to look at.  It\'s a concrete pad,
with a nearby stream, to supply unrefined fuel for the starships.  There is
a radar beacon, and a warning system to let Lizi know when someone is in
orbit.  The pad only has room for four ships, if a fifth showed up, Lizi
would have to put the extra ship in the field behind the starport.  She
would first have to move out the cows that typically graze there.

All of the residents on Helios favor the Federalist wing of the assembly,
and while they believe in the wing, politics is not a way of life.
Assemblyman Nealgu summed up the Heliosian attitude best when he said,
"There are much more important things in life than arguing about the finer
points of law. People should get out and do stuff; we Helosians try to lead
by example."

on facing?

Both TNE and Brilliant Lances used facing to determine two things: (i) what
weapons can bear on a target, and (ii) what systems can be damaged by a hit.

Thus, if I\'m running away with my stern towards you, I can\'t shoot you with
my spinal mount.  Similarly, if I\'m heading straight towards you, you can\'t
hit my maneuver drive.  (But you\'ll probably nail my bridge.)

Now, facing is a real problem for large actions.  In fact, Battle Rider
ignores facing.  But for small actions it is (I think) fun.  

Problem is, if the existing T4 space combat system doesn\'t use facing (and I
get the impresion they left it out) it doesn\'t make sense to add it to a
simplified version.  Guess I\'ll be sticking to Brilliant Lances.  Time to
write a T4 to BL ship conversion program :-(


Simplified Sensor Suggestion:

Could you combine sensing and shooting into the same roll by using the lowest
range and skill level between the sensor and weapon (and their operators)? 
Saves a step...

    'body' => 'Imperial Citizenship

Like Ethan, I can\'t get to all my stuff right now, but I\'m certain I read
somewhere about an emperor (after Cleon I) granting citizenship to all
sentients within the Imperium.  Which obviously means that 

(a) they didn\'t all have it (or why grant it), and

(b) being a citizen must have been better than just being a resident (or why
make such a big deal about it)


The Moot

Was the Moot in existence before the founding of the Third Imperium?  If it
was, we could model it like the Senate (ie. formerly significant, but reduced
to a debating club and rubber-stamp for the emperor).  

So, suppose that the Moot was the governing body of the Sylean Federation. 
At first a relatively small (and functional) body, over the years it has
grown larger and less effective (like the House of Lords, the Privy Council,
and so forth).  However, individuals within it are powerful, either by
offices that they hold or influence that they have.  After years of
politicing, Cleon and his faction (and he must have had support for this)
manage to get the Imperium restored (their word).  Will the Moot eliminate
itself?  No.  Will its members give up all their power?  No.  Instead, they
compromise.  

The Moot is retained as a body, and even retains powers within the original
borders of the Sylean Federation.  Some powers are voluntarily (and
explicitly) given to the emperor.  Others are let slip by default, even
though officially retained by the Moot.  The power structure shifts over a
few generations, as nobles realize that sitting in the Moot matters less than
holding an Imperial Governorship.

This also leaves room for drifts in signifieds - shifts in meaning for
language and customs.  Two examples (both fairly well-known in sf circles):

1) When Wren built St. Pauls in London, the King described it as "aweful,
pompous, and artificial" - which was actually a compliment, today we would
say "awe-inspiring, full of pomp, and well-built" (source: Poul Anderson)

2) One of the primary rights in the USA is freedom of religion.  But when
that was written one of the \'several liberties\' being infringed upon by the
British was the right to discriminate against Catholics, who were even
allowed their own laws in other British colonies.  The founders would have
been shocked to learn that freedom of religion included non-Protestant
Christianity, let alone other religions entirely. (source: John Barnes)



Another thought: possibly there should be some \'meaningless and trivial\'
stuff included in the founding document.  After all, look at the Magna Carta!
 Mentions things like specific amounts for death duties, bans all fishweirs
from all rivers, and standardizes measures for wine, corn (wheat), and cloth!
 This in addition to things like habius corpus.  So maybe we should include
some stuff we know will sound silly in 1105.

	I\'ve spent a fairly considerable amount of time trying to make BB 
warheads work.  They present a number of problems with both technical and 
gaming aspects.
	Getting a missile close enough to hit a ship with kinetic energy 
weapons is very difficult because if the target has any trainable weapons 
(laser turrets) it becomes a trivial problem to shoot down a missile at 
such a short range that there is essentially no light-lag.  A missile 
trying for an intercept gets fewer and fewer options for how to 
accelerate.  This severely reduces its evading opportunities and makes 
predicting the missile\'s future position much easier.
	The answer, as I see it, is to use a BB warhead which detonates 
some distance out from the target.  The BBs spread out in an even 
pattern so that no matter where the target runs to, it will be struck by 
at least one BB.  Replacing the mass of a nuke warhead with one made up 
of  BBs (and using a realistic formula for missile delta-v) gives a 
pretty good point of comparison.  Assuming that the target ship\'s facing 
is unknown, such a missile must detonate at a few thousand kms, or less, 
(depending on acceleration capabilities of target) to hit a 100Td ship.  
This sounds pretty good, but I have been assured by folks on the Beta 
list more knowledgable than I that any ship laser could eat dozens of 
these missiles at such a close range.
	If we assume that the target\'s facing is known (reasonable given 
what our resident astronomers have been able to deduce about Trav 
sensors) and that the ship has a limited rate of turning, 
(1degree/second/maneuverG) then our detonation range moves out to a more 
comfortable 10,000 or so Kms.
	This is where the gaming problem comes in.  The equation to
determine the detonation range and BB density of a KKM involves several
squared terms so that changing the target\'s acceleration or rate of turn
capabilities creates drastic changes. A warhead which is devastating
against a 1G ship is barely effective against a 4+G ship.  Why?  Because
higher accelerations give the ship a greatly larger future position 
footprint.  Furthermore, since the BBs are spread out in a grid across 
the targets footprint, bigger ships take more hits than smaller ships.  A 
missile capable of hitting a 100Td adventurer\'s ship will do 1,000 hits 
to a 100,000Td battleship.  It won\'t penetrate the big ships armor but it 
would instantly kill almost every surface fixture on the ship.  Taking 
this one step further, why not just fill the warhead with sand and polish 
the target down to a cue ball?
	If you start talking about targets that can\'t maneuver out of the 
way you confront exactly the same issues as the rock-droppers.  Speaking 
of rocks, KKMs have at least as much potential for mass destruction as 
the nuclear det-lasers that some would like to ban for being too dangerous.
	So how does one accomodate KKMs into the game?  Give different
stats for each type of target?  Assume a 4G target, allowing lower accel
targets to escape with less damage than they deserve and higher accel
targets with none?  How do you regulate/defend against the mass
destruction capabilities of KKMs?
	If I knew the answers to these questions I would have posted 
FF&S/BL rules for KKMs a couple of months ago.
	Remember, you asked :-)

	You\'re right.  There\'s no good reason for ships not to use x-ray
lasers.  If you want a justification then tuneables are used so that 
fire into an atmosphere is still possible.

	Folks on the TML noticed that too and created the rule that a

Traded e-mail with Matt Machtan on this subject late last week, the

As of 8/16/96, they still hadn\'t received them from the printers, and 
it sounded like we were looking at end of August at the earliest.

Well, I want skill to count more, so 1 die it is.

I\'d *like* to think skill is the most important, and for roleplaying
purposes that would work well, <g> but system quality should come in a
close second.  Randomness needs to be included to create some
unpredictibility, but it should be less important than skill or system
quality.  Comments?

Ok we agree on that then. We\'ll use ranges.

Actually, we probably should.  The ship\'s weapon and sensor tables are
based on those ranges aren\'t they?  It starts to get more complicated the
more ranges you add though.  I\'m unsure about this.

I thought it fit in well with T4\'s use of several dice for tasks too.  It
*does* raise system qualities influence a good bit, but not *too* much.

>Why 1/2 Pilot?  Why not just Pilot?  

Well, I was using Pilot as a default skill, but I don\'t mind using Pilot +
Tactics even.

This one!

I don\'t think it will bog the system down.  Sum Pilot and Tactics once
before you start the battle, then just add that sum to the dice.  Because
we are aiming this at PC ships, I suspect will have more players with high
pilot skill than players with high tactics skill.

Movement is decided...except for ranges.  We need to decide whether to use
T4\'s or simplify with fewer.

Well, we don\'t *have* to use opposed tasks. Let me think on that.

Agreed! 

The weapon factor we are looking for is the TO HIT factor.  I was thinking
different weapons would have some chance to hit at
different ranges.

I seems a little more complicated than I\'d like, and I can\'t say I like the
defender launching the sandcasters when the attack is successful...that\'s
too darn late! <g>

Let me think about this some more.  Why don\'t we think about how the system
will roleplay itself out?

I think Joe and I are talking *really* small actions, 2 or maybe at most 3
ships, and non-warships at that.  I wouldn\'t count on many ships having
spinal mounts, foex.  <g> I *do* like the idea of facing having an effect
on where damage is done though.

I think Dave and Merrick are already talking about that on gdw-beta. There
are likely to be several ship combat systems ranging from ridiculasly
simple to very complex before we get through. <g> 

>Simplified Sensor Suggestion:

I started to say yeah, then changed my mind to no, then yes.  <g> The thing
is I don\'t really want a simple wargaming solution.  I want a *roleplaying*
solution.  I want the pilot, the sensor
operator, the gunner, the engineer all to *do* something!  Foex, the pilot
maneuvers (in or out), the gunner shoots, the sensOp ??????, and the
engineer fixes damage.  

I\'m thinking maybe...

an Attack has two steps:

Sensor systems battle:
        SensOp goes for lock  VS  SensOp tries to jam
         [Getting a lock should be difficult and depend on range]
         [Maintaining a lock should be easier]
        
Weapon systems battle:
        Gunner with a plus for a lock  VS  Gunner deployed defense
         

I\'m about convinced the progressive die roll would work for the sensor lock
advantage...


...Joe, what do you think?

Dunno. Copyrights and trademarks (in my layman\'s understanding) are
 tangible assets, of a corporation which can be disposed of when the

Right; I\'m in agreement here.  I assume that this "establishing document"
would be at least as much propaganda and politics as it would be a legal
document.

I\'m in favor of the Imperial constitution being a loose collection of
agreements, proclamations, and long-standing tradition, than a formal
constitution that was drawn up at the founding of the empire (in other
words, more like Great Britain than the United States).

In addition to all of that, there probably are some interesting
circumstances surrounding Cleon\'s rise to power.  I seriously doubt that he
was without both detractors and rivals - and (as in Rome prior to Caesar)
there may well have been some predecessors that almost, but not quite,
established an Empire before Cleon did.  It\'s interesting to speculate on
what all of those circumstances might have been.

Definitely a bad idea as stated, but there\'s a good thread in there.  In my
campaigns, every resident of every world was an Imperial Subject.  A Subject
only had those rights that local (planetary) law gave them, and as long as a
Subject didn\'t break any Imperial laws, the Imperium left them alone under
the governance of whatever world they happened to be on.  If a Subject broke
an Imperial law, and wound up in Imperial custody, there would be an
Imperial trial (if they wound up in the custody of some world, so be it; the
Imperium let the world\'s courts try them instead).

Imperial Citizens, which consisted of any active-duty or honorably-discharged
Imperial Navy, Marine, or Scout serviceperson (in my campaign, the Army was
composed of local forces only), plus Knights and Nobility, were entitled to
due process and trial in Imperial courts (in my campaigns, this involved a
personal appeal to the appropriate Imperial representative on the world).

Note that this is significantly different than immunity from local laws
(although the effect was sometimes similar).  Depending on the severity of
the crime and the potential punishment, the Imperial representative could
either deny the request (and leave the Citizen at the mercy of the local
court - this was usually done only for misdemeanor and other truly minor
crimes where the only punishment would be a fine), schedule an Imperial
trial (the case would be heard by an Imperial judge, almost always a noble,
using Imperial rules of evidence, and with sentancing up to the judge), or
could recommend banishment (the no trial is held, but the Citizen is
banished from the world in question; if he or she ever returns there, the
local courts can do with them whatever they like).

The royal "we" usually meant that the royalty was speaking for the entire
country.  I don\'t think that "We, <name> ..." would be used that way,
though.

Since T4 starship weapons have three listed ranges, how about expanding the
range table slightly:

Out of Contact 		- Beyond sensor range, unsighted, escaped
Out of Range		- Sighted, but outside of weapons range.
Extreme Range		- Within range of longest-ranged weapons (band 4)
Long Range		- Within range of long-ranged weapons (band 3)
Effective Range		- Within range of most weapons (band 2)
Short Range		- Within range of all weapons (band 1)
Contact			- Used only for boarding, no weapons fire

I don\'t think so.  Boarding would really require that the oponnent be
disabled (unable to maneuver).  To board a ship, I\'d say that you have to
start at short range, have an oponnent whose unable to maneuver, and then
close the range.

Here\'s a thought for you, borrowed from 20th century Earth history.  Perhaps
the Moot was created with fairly broad powers to approve the sucession, veto
Imperial legislation, and other "supervisory" roles ... but the Emperor
persuaded them to abdicate this power entirely.

How?

Simple.  The Emperor has the power the ennoble anyone; I\'m sure he could
find enough people to support him that he could "water down" the moot with
nobles.  If he can convince the existing nobles of the Moot that he\'s
serious about doing so, then it\'s quite possible that the Moot would
abandon it\'s powers without having to be so watered down (the Nobility would
much rather be a less-powerful debating society than see the Emperor elevate
commoners - oh, the horror - COMMONERS into the Moot).

It worked for King Edward, didn\'t it?

I don\'t mind including facing, but not in the basic RSSC rules.  It can 
be in the advanced section, with black globes and whatnot.

We\'ll be using ranges.  The ranges will be:  

Out of Range (or whatever):  No sensors or weapons are usable at this range.
Long:  Military-class systems are useful at this range and closer.
Medium:  Civilian-class systems are useful at this range and closer.
Short:  
V. Short:  Boarding actions possible at this range if enemy is disabled.

For simplicity and compatability, I move that the T4 task system be used 
for as many tasks as possible.  I like the movement system you came up 
with, so let\'s stick with that.  But when it comes to firing weapons, 
launching active defenses, operating sensors, etc., we should use the 
Opposed Tasks as given in the T4 Tasks section.  Yes, this means using 
1/2 dice.  I think it\'s worthwhile though because that will give it a 
more seamless unity with the T4 rule book.

Here\'s the task table for Military systems:

Range         Difficulty           Dice
V.Close       Easy                 Auto
Close         Average              2D
Medium        Difficult            2.5D
Long          Formidable           3D

Here\'s the task table for Civilian Systems:

Range         Difficulty           Dice
V.Close       Average              2D
Close         Difficult            2.5D
Medium        Formidable           3D
Long          Staggering           3.5D

Comments?


> Well, we don\'t *have* to use opposed tasks. Let me think on that.

I thought about it over night, and I believe you are right that we should 
not go with the T4 ship combat system in this manner.  Let\'s do as I said 
above, and like you\'ve suggested from the beginning, and use the Opposed 
Tasks rules.


Sensor Lock:
	Must have sensor lock before you can fire.  There are three 
states for sensors: active scan, passive scan, jamming.  Sensor ops 
player declares which state the sensors will be in for each entire turn - 
they cannot be jamming when the opponent is scanning, then actively 
searching when the player is trying to attack.  
	If actively scanning, then the other ship can sense him and lock 
on automatically.
	If passively scanning, the other ship must make a task roll based 
on range.  Sensor Ops, DM + Sensor Rating.
	If jamming, the other ship must make an opposed task roll: Sensor Ops, 
with DM +Sensor Rating.

	After you have a sensor lock, you may fire.  Otherwise, you may not.  
Firing is an opposed task, gunner vs. defending pilot(?).  Dice roll is 
based on range, as always.

	That\'s as far as I can get until I get home and have the T4 rule 
book to refer to.  Some of this stuff may be wrong, as I may be 
mis-remembering the opposed task rules.  At any rate, this is along the 
lines of what I want to do, and I belive it agrees with what has been 
said before.

More later, but please comment on what is here.

Rob,

I think you\'re absolutely right.  Facing doesn\'t belong in RSSC, unless 
we do some sort of advanced rules that would bridge the gap between an 
RSSC and a full-up system like they\'re talking about on GDW-Beta.

My theory in all this is that an RSSC shouldn\'t have any more complicated

SMG is simply a matter of making a task roll based on skill and range.  I 
don\'t want it to be quite that simple - I like the idea of opposed tasks, 
esp. given the systems in use on ships and their 3 dimensions of 
maneuverability - but it shouldn\'t require an entirely new set of rules.

What do you think?

That\'s what I figured as well.  The act of declaring an empire is a 
risky one; the declaration will be a glorified press release.  Cleon 
will spend as much time establishing his _right_ to be Emporer and 
the reasons why the empire needs to exist.  

The declaration needs to be something emotionally evocative, 
something for the nobles as well as the rank and file to rally 
around.  Putting too much legalese in will put people to sleep, not 
inspire them.  (They will need to be inspired to a patriotic fervour 
because Cleon\'s declaration will not be popular with quite a few 
people)

Put another way, the declaration must avoid legal statement for the 
exact reason that the declaration will cause unrest.  Look at it this 
way.  Cleon doesn\'t know for sure if his declaration will be 
universally embraced or if it will lead to a huge civil war.  He will 
be aware that painting himself into a corner with too many civil 
liberties in the declaration would be bad.  If the civil war comes 
about, he might need to resort to extreme measures to win it.

Just my .02Cr

I like the idea a lot.  A hot pilot could (I think should) be able to evade a 
pursuing enemy even though the enemy had a faster ship.  This is what 
roleplaying games are all about.  The hero (with Pilot-4 and a ship with 
maneuver-2) is jumped by a pirate ship (Pilot-2 and a ship with maneuver-3).  
The hero is Hans Solo and Maverick all rolled into one.  He does some of that 
pilot sh-t and leaves the pirate wondering "where\'s he gone." I am definitely 
using this in my games.

        Naw:  I figure that if they bore a resemblance to anything current
they\'d owe more to the Civil law tradition than the Common law tradition.
With a few exceptions, namely corporate law, where currently Canada, New
Zealand, and some U.S. jurisdictions (in no particular order) are leading
the way, the Civil law tradition quite simply makes more sense.  For those
of you that haven\'t a clue as to what I\'m talking about, the Civil law is
rooted in Roman law.  In many cases the Romans had things figured out for
millennia before the Common law got around to dealing with things.

        This doesn\'t mean that it\'s *better*; it\'s just that as an
intellectual construct it is more accessible, rational, logical, and
rigourously analytical.  Both systems, given the same set of facts, will
usually come to similar conclusions; it\'s just that the process whereby the
Civilian court will arrive at that process is less convoluted.  Sit Jooe
Aaveraage down with a modern (Civilian) civil code and he\'ll probably be
able to understand most of it.  Very roughly speaking, the common law and
civil law are converging; many civilian  jurisdictions are enacting
civilian takes on trust legislation, and the common law has and is being
influenced by the civil law in many areas.  However, I think that since the
Common law\'s approach is only due to the idiosyncracies of English history,
the Civil law approach will be more frequently encountered.

        And I also think that it\'d be the one most likely to be found in
the Imperium.  The reasons that I say this are that Civil law finds its
source in legislative enactments, often by major codifiers such as the
Emperor Justinian, or Napoleon, and owes nothing to judges.  As well, it\'s
eminently portable (Have Civil Code, will Travel) and adaptable; it\'s been
adopted by all Europe save the U.K., parts of North America, most if not
all of South America, the C.I.S., most of Africa, Mao Dynasty Imperial
China <grin>, Japan, Taiwan, and those parts of Asia that weren\'t colonised
by the Brits.

Hi,

As noted in each of my reviews, the T4 system uses the Merchant Prince 
system of trade rules.  That is, the goods are of indeterminate nature.  
They are merely marked as to tonnage and what sort of world they come 
from (ie, Lo Ni Po - low tech, non industrial, poor).

I hope this gives you the information you need.

	I realy like the idea of a "make him blind" missile, this
	would be a perfect tactic for a pirate: Make him blind and
	get on board.

	Hm lets think of a Jayhawk :

	The Jayhawk\'s extrem EMS range is 8 hexes, a typical missile
	has 8 or 12 G-turns. A pirate shurely can see the Jayhawk
	because of better sensors 12 hexes, he can launch the missiles
	and they can be first seen at 8, at this point the missile
	would be on drift closing the Jayhawk, so the roll would be
	Imposible-3 (Extrem=Imposible, sub-micro -2, coasting -1)
	Even at close range the sensor roll would be Imposible-0,
	as the missile now has the posibility to make evasion.

	So a "SandMan" Missile would make a Jayhawk blind.

	Normaly every missile seen can be destroyed if you have a
	good FireControll, which can ignore Diff-Mod\'s.
	But you need to make a sensor lock on the missile first,
	and even a Gazelle needs a Formidable sensor lock, because
	a missile is sub micro.

	From FFS (114) : "The one area where nuclear warheads are  used
	fairly regularly is on space-based X-Ray laser missiles"

	So IMHO only "mass destruction" is banned, not the kind of
	technologie. Its banned to throw rocks or nukes to a city,
	because both will likely kill more civilians than place
	a direct hit on military point.

	To place I direct hit I would design the following rule :

	The missile MUST have more g-turns left than the number
	of G-Turns spend for evasion by the target. The base
	difficulty is Imposible with the following modifiers :

	Target  : Micro -1, Very Small +0, Small +1, ...
	        : +1 per 2 G-Turns spend in evasion
	Missile : -1 per 2 G-Turns left for the hit, when arived at
	          close range (0 hexes)

	Did you calculated the damage of these KKM\'s and SandMan\'s.

	Hm even ships without CG lifters have tuneable lasers.

	My design limit was that they need to fit in a turret, so
	will be limited by the displacement of the HPG.

	But TL*15 sounds good as a limit, so lets design some X-Ray
	lasers. As the effective range of these lasers is 12 hexes
	for turrets and 15 hexes for barbetts.

	I decided make two versions with different beam pointers.
	The wight and displacement differences are marginal (under
	2m3, 2 tonnes)

Not to drag out interminable gdw-beta discussions into the harsh light of 
the TML...but I should also note that impact-type missiles are a lot
easier to shoot down than detonation lasers. The net result is that you
end up with large swarms of missiles trying to overwhelm point defense
systems, with the missiles so deadly that a single hit kills a player-sized
spacecraft...a very different flavour than canonical combat. There are a 
couple of design sketches for non-nuclear lasers with more moderate damage
and higher survivability - missiles that throw huge clouds of BBs at very
long detonation ranges, so only a few (tiny) BBs hit but the missile is 
somewhat safer from PD, or missiles that have chemical lasers...but overall
the detonation laser stuff actually makes more physical sense than previous
versions, and produces nice results from a roleplaying standpoint (missiles
are dangerous but not utterly devastating, and a small ship can carry enough
to have some chance of getting through another small ship\'s point defense.)

Good question. The laser designs certainly show a lack of variety; I think
they just plain didn\'t do any decent lasers...It is somewhat hard to get 
a 80-hex ER laser at TL-13 with x-rays in a normal turret, but not very hard.
Also, x-ray lasers have poor atmospheric performance...but overall it\'s 
really just an oversite on the parts of the designers.

TML and gdw-beta players have all adopted the "TL*50" rule to deal with this
very issue: maximum discharge energy for laser weapons is equal to their
tech level times 50 Mj. Otherwise, as you note, there\'s no need for any
weapons other than ever-bigger lasers. This has become (implicitly) official
in T4.

I think there\'s a typo or two in the table...the bore sizes, for example.

It does suffer a little from not having much in the way of sensors. Still, if
you think fighters are the ultimate weapon, go ahead and use them - design a
a carrier and take it up against a comparable conventional warship (one 
should note that most of the conventional designs in BL aren\'t that 
good - I\'d call them heavily underarmoured.)

Don\'t really shop the comics places, so can\'t say on that.  Of the 5

I checked here (Pensacola FL) again late yesterday calling a game store and
a comics shop.  (I\'ve called the game store every day since the 15th.  <g>)
Neither had it, both say they *will* have it. The guy at the comics shop
called his distributer to check and called me back, saying that Traveller
hasn\'t been released yet, and won\'t be until the end of the month.  I
didn\'t argue with him, why kick the messenger even if his news is wrong.

Stuart, I\'m glad *somebody* got the book.  Where are you located? Maybe we
can track the distribution pattern. <g>

Just goes to show that, despite its proximity to Lake Geneva, Northestern 
Illinois is pretty much devoid of quality games stores.  

BTW, I went up to Lake Geneva last weekend for their annual faire, and 
was surprised to find that the local phone directory listed abstolutely 
no game stores.  Under "Games, Retail" it had only TSR (which, unless 
they have a company store at their facility, was rather strange).  

Almost like going to Silicon Valley and finding no computer resellers...

I\'m new to the TML, but not to Traveller. I\'ve been playing the game and exploring the 
game universe since \'78 or so. I\'ve skipped around a lot between lots and lots of 
various game systems, but always did I come back to Traveller.

I was heartbroken to see GDW go out of business, since Traveller: The New Era and the 
Reformation Coalition/Star Viking background excited me like no other RPG has in the 
last ten years. I\'m sorry to see the RC laid by the wayside by IG, but I hope they will 
revisit the RC soon.

Enough introductory and whining for one post; on to commentary!

Clint, my local store got a Imperium Games flyer back in mid-July. He knew I was deep 
into TNE and looking foreward to anything with _Traveller_ written on it, so he showed 
it to me. I then badgered, annoyed, vexed and harrassed the poor store owner here in the 
armpit of California\'s Central Valley to order it for prerelease, and I _kept after him_ 
like a pouncer after bleeding game until he got it. After I did, I thanked him and 
promised to buy the forthcoming supplements from him.

That way, he gets a loyal customer, and I get my Traveller goodies <grin>.


First impressions: it is what Marc Miller promised -- return to classic Traveller with 
the benefit of 20 years\' experience. The character creation system is about what I 
expected. Aging every five years instead of every term will take getting used to, 
though. Skills -- the variable dice version of the task system seems to work...but there 
were no task difficulties listed for normal starship operations. The combat system works 
well, even if the weapons list is a little short for my taste (I\'m into 
military/mercenary adventures). Equipment -- They give us AFVs but no _anti-tank_ 
weaponery! Ships -- I wasn\'t surprized that IG tossed out the HEPlaR drive for high-trch 
ships . . . the QSDS is very nice indeed. I wish more time had been spent on explaining 
what a starship crew _does_ during a journey! Rest of the Book: What I expected, more or 
less. The art was STUNNING, the color pieces had me asking "What _is_ this 
thing/ship/whatever supposed to be?" all the time!

I\'m looking forward to the Year Zero background books, but pining away for the return of 
the Reformation Coalition.

second print batch (I believe TNE had one or two of these).

        Per Adventure 1, "Kinunir," it was created by "Imperial Edict 97,"
so it wasn\'t in the establishing document. The library data entry on the
Imperial Warrant implies but doesn\'t state that the edict was issued by
Strephon. MegaTraveller Library Data doesn\'t have the same implication, but
does state that Dukes and Archdukes could also issue them.

	Those two books are the rules from the Traveller STarter Edition 
- - a boxed set that came out about concurrently with the Traveller Book.  
They contain about the same info as the Traveller Book, if I recall 
correctly.  I don\'t think that they are all that rare, my local bookstore 
has 3-4 copies.

Well, I\'m in the San Francisco Bay Area, and my softcover showed up on
Tuesday the 20th... keep the faith!

What was great was *how* the staff at Gamescape told me that T4 was in.  The
had grown used to my daily visits, all of which started with them shout
"NO!" before I could even ask if it was in.  Yesterday, I returned home from
a day with my niece, checked my voice mail, and heard all of them yell "YES!!"

You gotta love good games stores.

If a ship uses active sensors, it should automatically be detected by any

Hmm.  Perhaps we could use one of the range sets from T4?  Perhaps the 
ground combat ranges:  Contact, V.Short, Short, Medium, Long, V.Long

Would that be acceptable?

Please note that, in T4, "Easy" tasks are automatically accomplished 
by anyone with skill level 1 or greater (1.5D for level-0 skill use, if 
allowed for that skill).  Also note that there is a task rating between 
Formidable and Impossible, called Staggering.

See above.

You\'re right, size should definitely come into play.

Active and passive sensors, given the same rating value, will have the 
same chance of detecting another ship.  If you look at the Standard 
Sensor Designs from QSDS, you\'ll see that, at the highest levels, ships 
tend to have very high active sensor ratings vs. passive.  For example, 
Medium Military at TL 12 has a rating of: A16 P5 J16, meaning an Active 
rating of 16, Passive of 5, and Jamming of 16.  

Therefore, I feel that simply using the values as DM\'s will do the trick.
If you have, for example, the above sensors intalled, sure you can easily 
detect somethin by going Active, but you\'ll also reveal yourself to every 
ship within range. Or, you can use passive sensors, take a lower chance 
of success, and hope no one else is successful at scanning you.

If you\'re jamming, then that value should be a negative DM if we are 
going with your system.

Works for me.

But, I would like to change the range names to:

 =============================================================
 RANGE  (from Derek Wildstar)
 
 No Contact      - beyond sensor range, unsighted, escaped.
 Out of Range    - In Sensor range, Out of weapons range.
 Long            - In range of band 4 weapons.
 Medium          - In range of band 3 & 4 weapons.
 Short           - In range of band 2, 3 & 4 weapons.
 V. Short        - In range of band 1 to 4 weapons (all).
 Contact         - Boarding only, no ship weapons may fire.
 =============================================================

This will jibe with Ground Combat better, and also includes the subset 
that is from the T4 space combat (v. short, short, medium, long).

I think there will be less confusion that way.  Any time we can avoid 
making people learn something new, we should take it IMO.

With our daughter receive our regret at having been delayed in our arrival
in assembly.  The battle here has gone well thanks to the starships of new
design you have provided.

Please consider our thoughts on the pending declaration of our combined
intention to reform the Empire of Man. (1)  We hope and expect to be in
assembly with you when the great moment is at hand.

We agree that the declaration should stem from a "spontaneous" movement of
the lords.  The proposal know as the "Oath of Sylea" comes closest to our
intentions. Matters of constitution are best left for another day when we
can deliberate at length.  We must act know in a way that will legitimize
our current actions and perhaps preclude the kind of violent action upon
which we are currently embarked in your name.

Yours in service, loyalty and honor from the depths of our heart and being;

    'body' => 'Eris\' Proposal 4, while offering good Initiative and Movement rules, 
generates target numbers that are too large when it comes to tasks 
relying on the Range table\'s # of dice to roll (Detection right now, and 
undoubtedly Attack Reslution if it follows the same format).

The class of ship this system is meant to be used for will have a size of 
about 8 (100 to 999 tons), Active sensors of 0-10, Passive of 2-4, and 
Jamming of 0-4.

Add in skills, M-drive rating, etc., and you come up with a target number 
it is quite easy to achieve even at the "Formidable" difficulty level.

I think this system we are developing should handle any of the basic 
ships - any ship in the T4 rulebook, and quite a few of those in the 
upcoming Starships book (which will include the Corsair, some more 
fighters, etc.).  

The T4 rule book includes the 200-ton Patrol Cruiser, with scanners of:
A10 P4 J4.  It also includes the 300-ton Mercenary Cruiser, with scanners 
of: A10 P4 J10.  Although most other ships in the T4 book have ratings in 
the 0-3 range for each, I think it is important that we consider such ships 
as the Mercenary Cruiser and Patrol Cruiser when developing the RSSC 
system.

The sticking places (ie, sources of large numbers) are Size and Sensors.  
We can either ignore those factors (yuck!), change them (double yuck!, 
but T4 does this, believe it or not), or deal with them.  I think we 
should deal with them.

The way I envision it, RSSC will heavily rely on skills for success.  
But, we also have to factor in equipment ratings, and a random factor.  

I wanted to go with a "contested tasks" rule, but those same factors keep 
messing it up.  Let me show you what I have, and perhaps someone else 
will come up with a way to handle those factors better than I have:


Contested Tasks (Proposed Rule):

Each individual makes a task roll, using the basic T4 rules.  That is, 
add the skill and relevant characteristic, and add appropriate DMs to 
determine the target number.  The number of dice to roll is based on 
difficulty, which in our case is, in turn, based on range.

Here\'s how it plays out:

One succeeds, one fails:  The one who succeeds gets to do what s/he 
                          wanted to do.

Both Win:  Whichever player\'s roll is furthest from his target number wins.

Both Fail:  Whichever player\'s roll is closest to her target number wins.


This way, there are no re-rolls, and no times when nothing happens 
(unless, of course, that is what the winner wanted).

I think this system is more exciting, because both players participate, 
each character gets to contribute his or her skill, and it keeps the 
action moving.

The problem, of course, comes in the DM\'s, which is the problem Eris is 
running into.  

(Sigh)

A.  Weapon Lock Attempt (Deleted)

	[This phase is unnecessary, as this is achieved by Detecting the 
ship.  If it is detected, or is running Active sensors, then the weapons 
lock has been achieved.  Otherwise, it is impossible to fire on the ship.]

[The below assumes the defending ship is within effective range of the 
weapon to be used, of course.]

[T4 uses the defender\'s Size Rating as the target number.  Unfortunately, 
this number is too big to be a good DM, as it is from 5 to 12 (most often 
at this level of battle, it will be 8, as that covers ship in the size 
100-999 ton range).  So, we can either:

1)  Use Size as the target
2)  Discard Size
3)  Come up with another, different Size Rating (some sort of conversion 
chart, perhaps, or use the number in the hundreds column of the tons 
displacement, since this system is meant for use with ships that are small).

Although it is perhaps unrealistic, I favor discarding the size rating 
altogether for this system.  If that isn\'t a popular decision, then I\'d 
prefer option 1 to option 3.  The last resort, IMO, would be option 3.  
The system laid out below assumes using option 2.]

[Fire Control Ratings are another DM in the T4 system.  They range from 0 
to 6, but are most often 0 for ships such as Traders (almost all T4 basic 
rule book ships have ratings of 0).  The Mercenary Cruiser, for example, 
has a rating of 2.  We can dump this, too, but perhaps it would be wise 
to include it as a DM.]

============================================================================
IV.  Combat for Ship with Initiative

A)  Weapon To Hit Resolution

	Target Number:  Gunnery skill
	                + Fire Control Rating
                        + Target\'s Size Rating
                        - Target\'s G Rating
                        - Target\'s Pilot or Tactics Skill
                           (Whichever is higher)

	# of Dice to Roll based on Range (q.v.)


B.  Damage Resolution and Allocation

	Resolution:  [Is this where defenses are subtracted?]

	Allocation:  Subtract the value from the weapon rating from Armor 
(if any) first, then from Structure.  Once Structure is at 0, the ship is 
destroyed.  Each Armor hit results in a roll on the Surface Explosion 
Table (T4, p. 120).  Each Structure hit results in a roll on the Interior 
Explosion Table (T4, p. 120).  Hits that take away the last of the Armor 
and then do damage to Structure get one roll on each table.  Meson Gun 
hits only roll on the Interior Explosion table.  
        [This is all from T4.]
==========================================================================

I still think the numbers generated in the To Hit section are too big.

Ok, we\'ve got two parts nailed down:

Initiative          -  agreement
Movement            -  agreement
Detection           -  almost agreed to
Sensor vs Jammers   -  we have several competing ideas here

Damage Resolution   -  we haven\'t really started yet

Agreed to Rule:  Any ship using active sensors is automatically
                 detected by all ships within sensor range.

Agreed to Rule:  Use the Other Ship\'s size is a plus DM.

Somebody else suggested that too.  I\'m not tied to range names, but the
ones used in the ship combat in the T4 book would be more appropriate than
the ground combat range names, and we need to be consistent all across the
parts of RSSC.  

Range Name    Weapons bearing       Sensor Task
- ----
Contact     Boarding, no weapons    Easy
Very Short  1 - 4 band weapons      Easy
Short       2 - 4 band weapons      Easy
Medium      3 & 4 band weapons      Average
Long        band 4 weapons only     Difficult
Very Long   out of range            Formidible
No Contact  out of range            really impossible!

[For sensor task I\'m leaning toward the idea William\'s progressive rolls
triggered, or the progressive rolls themselves.  I really like have the
variable quality to the lock it gives.]

I know, I purposely did it that way.  I thought those Easys would draw some
comments.  I want ships to have a pretty good chance of *detecting* another
ship even at Very Long Range.  This is *just* detecting, not weapon locks. 
At No Contact a sensor detect is *really* impossible.

You have to detect the presence of a ship before you can even think about
shooting at it.  I\'d say you can "fire blind", but to have a *prayer* of a
chance you have to at least have detected the other ship\'s presence.  The
next step is trying to improve on simple detection to some kind of
"location solution", or "lock".

Ok, I don\'t know if it\'s that way in the real world, but it\'s that way in
the game so that\'s the way we\'ll go too.

Take a hard look at my post concerning William\'s progressive roll and the
simple alternative I proposed.  It handles the sensor vs jammer situation
and let\'s us finess ranges for sensors.  Range will still have to be used
in the Gunnery Task, but our goal is simplify and this idea does that.

I\'m not sure what balck hole my copy of "Kinunir" fell down, but 
Supplement 8:Library Data (A-M) contains no such implication (about 
Strephon). 
 
In any case, the word "warrant" may apply to more than 
the "Imperial Warrant" as we know it. According to my dictionary, 
the word can mean: "1a) authorization or sanction, as by a  
superior or the law". 
 
My suggestion to MM for the name of the document was the 
"Warrant of Restoration", as Cleon "authorizes" the restoration 
of Imperial (read: his) authority over Vilani and Solomani territories.

Ok, fine with me.  I\'d already agreed, got your message about
Detection before I saw this one.  <g> I just what it to match up with what
T4 is calling things so we don\'t confuse people.

There is a difference creeping in though, do we go with "Very Long" or "Out
of Range"?  They can mean the same thing, but we should be consistent.

	True.  Sometimes I forget that not everyone has participated in 
the massive "Brilliant Lances Done Right" discussions on the beta list.  
Since KKMs must get much closer to the target than even a det-laser, we 
had assumed that with a fairly decent sensor array (SR4) that a KKM 
should be automatically detected.  The example you give is not even the 
worst one.  If you use a heplar-powered missile with EMM and decoy 
dispensors the target becomes Impossible+1 to detect.  Because of this, 
and the fact that a missiles exhaust would be very visible at sub-hex 
ranges, we made the "auto-detect" rule.
	If you\'re interested in this subject, you might want to check out 
David Golden\'s page, I believe he has the latest edition of the beta-list 
rules compiled by Merrick.

<snip>
	This is very close to what the beta-list came up with.  The 
problem though is not the to-hit task.  The problem is dealing with all 
of the aspects of to-hit, range, and damage which vary with the 
situation.  Again, a BB missile that will obliterate a 1G 100Td target or 
a 6G 100,000Td target could be ineffective against a 4G 500Td target.  
Making simple rules for this sort of thing is very tough.  I may still 
try, but I gave up once and I may again.

> 	Did you calculated the damage of these KKM\'s and SandMan\'s.

	I didn\'t do the sand missile but I made a few BB missiles.  See 
above for the problems with them.

Nice to see they jumped on this.  I can understand that an errata 
page is a mixed blessing for a publisher, but I think they will 
benefit from their forthrightness about the game and its very few 
shortcomings...  

I\'m still reading my book...  Soon as I finish it (Probably tomorrow 
sometime), I\'ll post my thoughts on it.

1 thing I will tell you right away:  They\'ve done a superb job of 
putting together a book that is very pleasing to the eye.  Less of 
the annoying sidebars, lots of interior illustrations (with captions 
even), and the artwork by Chris Foss is absolutely breathtaking...  Ken 
or Marc, I\'m not sure whose idea it was to commission Chris for 
artwork, but it was a GREAT decision!

1 more thought on those who would burden this document with rules of 
war/imperial warrants/definition of sophonts and other hair-splits:

Most of us seem to be looking at the Imperium of Cleon I as though it 
were the Empire of Strephon...  NOTHING could be farther from the 
case...  The Empire of Cleon at Year 0 numbered maybe a couple of 
dozen systems, all within about 3-4 weeks travel of each other, while 
that of Strephon, spanned 11,000 systems, all withing about 3-4 years 
travel of each other.  The Empire of Cleon was on the rise.  The 
nobility would have the sense of purpose (manifest destiny) in year 0 
that is lacking in the later years of empire.

Finally, The sheer smallness of the Imperium in the early years is 
going to allow Cleon to have a measure of direct control that 
Strephon could never have dreamed of or imagined.  The Imperium is an 
authoritarian trade federation.  In the early years, I suspect that 
the key word is AUTHORITARIAN.  

In a situation where Cleon could get messages to the far extent of his 
empire in a couple of weeks, he is going to be able to exercise a lot more 
direct control than his successors.  There is therefore no reason he would 
want to tie his hands with minutiae.  In fact, since he is going to be fighting 
wars, subverting/absorbing rival governments, etc, he\'s going to avoid them 
like the plague, so as to avoid tying his hands...

I like it!  The art is unusual, but interesting.  The new ship designs are
odd, and I think I like the old designs earlier. However, it makes much
since, I sincerely hope that ship designs would have changed in the 1104
years between the founding of the Imperium and the CT era. 

A question:

How much to grav vehicles cost?  On pp 83-86 there are 3 specific models
of grav vehicle described:  The Rolen Ploitesse, the Iliant Lion, and the
Mylin Ranger.  They cost 50,000 Cr, 30,000 Cr and 40,000 Cr.  All but the
Lion are high speed (600-900 kph) the Lion is for some reason limited to
120 kph, even with 3 gees of acceleration, but hey, maybe it\'s open
topped. 

OK, great, sensibly priced, interesting, grav vehicles.  Now we turn to
the main text where the air raft is limited to 100 kph and costs 600,000
Cr, and the G carrier costs 100,000 Cr and has no listed top speed. 

Clearly one of these sets of data is a misprint.  I prefer the stats for 
the intersting, detailed grav vehicles, rather than the same old 
air-raft, but someone should clarify this one.

As for rules, I love the char gen system, the new aging rules make much
more sense.  I wish they added a -1 to aging rolls for say TL 11+, but
hey, its easy to add.  I also like the new large numbers of skills, though
they did overpower the Scout a bit.  As a minor change I\'d make Scout 1
skill/year + 1/term and make this true of all non-ranked professions (ie
Entertainer, Rouge and Scholar).  hey, I really *like* playing Scouts, but
they get 3 rand and service skills, extra skills a term and the change of
+2 on INT and EDU on mustering out, this seems like a too bit much. 

I don\'t like the new task system, because like TNE stats are much more
important than skills.  I\'d much have preferred Stat/2 or Stat/3 + Skill. 
I\'ll likely use the MT task system (Stat/5+ Skill vs 3+, 7+ 11+.. on 2D6)
grafted on the the new skills and such. 

My only major disappointment is the Psi system because I hate Psi 
points.  The psi system was the *only* thing I liked about TNE.  The best 
thing about that Psi system is being able to import the system from
the Dark Conspiracy Empathic Sourcebook:

In the Imperium they train Psionics, a few folks whose psionic training 
consists of a high Psi stat and taking lots of Pis drugs become Neuropaths,
and folks on odd, isolated (usually low-tech) worlds know Mysticism (this 
throws folks off really well).  Best to drop Sorcery though, it doesn\'t fit.

Soon I\'ll post the Andre Norton derived Traveller Psi system I\'ve 
been working on.

Other than a few complaints I love it.

You\'re right.  It should be "Very Long," since it /is/ possible to use 
sensors and communicators at that range. (Ergo, they are not truly "out 
of range" of anything but weapons.)

It\'s not a one-horse town, but it\'s not too big either.  Having only been 
there once, and not knowing which other town I could compare it to that 
you\'d be familiar with, I\'m at a loss! :)  Uh...bigger than a bread box? :)

We did drive around quite a bit (okay, we got lost[G]), and it seemed to 
be about the size of the town in CA I came from.  And that town had a 
games store... :)

Don\'t quote me on this, as I may have misinterpreted an email I got from IG
on the subject.  (Actually, I was asking whether the printing delay had
anything to do with fixes; it doesn\'t.)


Everyone; go see Trainspotting.  Off topic perhaps, but worthy of being

the attack phase of RSSC.

 ----

3 Attack Phase

    3.1 Ship with the highest Initiative attempts to attack.
 
  3.1.1 Attempt Sensor/Weapons Lock - Once a sensor lock has been   
achieved, it can be maintained unless circumstances drastically change   
(such as the pirate ducking behind an asteroid).
  
   3.1.1.1 If target is actively scanning, then the attacking ship can   
sense target and lock on automatically.
          

   3.1.1.2 If target is passively scanning, then the attacking ship must   
make a task roll based on range:  Sensor Ops, DM + Sensor Rating.
   
   3.1.1.3 If target is jamming, then the attacking ship must make an   
opposed task roll: (SensorSkill+SensorFactor+?Die?)  vs   
(SensorSkill+JamFactor+?Die?)

 ----

Question:  Suppose shipA suceeds in acquiring sensor lock on shipB during   
turn1.  If shipB decides to begin jamming during turn2, does shipA have   
to attempt to re-establish the sensor lock, or does shipA automatically   
maintain the sensor lock?

I like the idea of opposing tasks for maneuver, but not this far.  At least,
not in clear space.  There is no way a pilot with a 1G ship can stop a pilot
with a 2G ship overhauling him, no matter how good he is.

Now, if the fight takes place in orbit, through a ring, or in similar
circumstances where \'terrain\' can be used for concealment or where superior
skill makes a difference, I\'ll agree with you.

[snip]

I agree with everything you said.

There\'s another reason for using a civil-law tradition: it\'s _not_ what\'s
used in America, therefore it will seem \'different & exotic\' to a large
gaming market.  I don\'t know how much of the T4 market will be teenagers, but
my colleagues south of the border tell me that most schools teach very little
history except American history and no law except American law. I know up
here we do a horrible job of teaching Asian history (nothing except where it
impinges on the West) and so I have impressed the non-Asian kids with my
detailed societies just by \'lifting\' elements from China, Vietnam and Burma.

As well, the tendency in Ct/MT for the Imperium to begin to resemble 20th
century North America in attitude/outlook/law will be held off for a bit. 
(This was a trend that HIWG writers noticed.  We figured it was caused by
many writers individually incorporating \'throwaway\' references, based on a
familiar setting, that were taken by other writers as \'canon\', as well as a
few writers (names withheld) who seemed to be incapable of writing with
characters that weren\'t 20th century American males in their native setting.)

T4 Space combat uses a subset of the Ground Combat ranges - only four of 
them.  Since you wanted more range bands than that, I figured extending 
it to the Ground Combat ranges made sense.  No incompatability, we\'re 
just using the same superset of the Space Combat ranges that the Ground 
Combat section uses.

Ah, so we\'re separating out detection and weapon lock, eh?  Ok.

I did, and I noted my concern - the wide ranges of values we\'ll be 
dealing with.  As long as you\'re comfortable with that, though . . .

GDW began printing CT that way toward the end of the CT era. You got a
Rules booklet and a Charts and Tables booklet. Generally, it came as part
of the "Starter Traveller" set (which also came with two adventures,
printed back-to-back, Shadows and Mission on Mithril), but they also
began printing Deluxe Traveller that way as well (I have both sets). In
fact, that is the only copy of CT that I have: I never got a copy of the three
little black books. I\'ve never seen the books, however, outside of the
boxed sets they were supposed to come with. I doubt they\'re supposed
to be sold that way.

ShipB will have to complete an opposed task of some sort to attempt 
jamming.  In effect, he will be trying his sensor skill and sensor 
jamming rating against ShipA\'s sensor skill and sensor (active/passive) 
rating (plus some random factor).

Harn-L is a discussion list, similar to the TML, devoted to Columbia Games\'

Yeah, it looks good.  Great job, guys.  Now I have to design all the
cool Foss ships in there :-)  Thanks for the straightforward fonts,
too.  The inside is elegant looking for no other reason than a
restrained font and consistant headers.  (I have to say I always
liked the design of the little black books, too)

Actually, there are some American precedents for this as well.  The 
US Supreme Court, which currently consists of 9 members, is not 
constitutionally or legally specified to have any particular number 
of justices.  There have been several instances in which Presidents 
have tried to "stuff" the Supreme Court with a bunch of handpicked 
nominee...  most recently, FDR in the late 30\'s...  Between adding 
your own members, and placing a few grumblers under house arrest (or 
spacing them) it would be easy to arrange...

Hi,
A bunch of us on the TML like the RC and are still creating stuff for
it.  A long article on Helios was just released two days ago. (Email me
for a copy if it was released before you signed onto the TML.) The next
planet we are doing is Phoebus. (Its a Sci-Fi game, and we start off
detaling the TL-4 and TL-3 planet in the  RC, go figure) 

If you have stuff you have created on the RC, we would all love to see
it. Or just offer suggestions on the stuff everyone else puts out.

"RENTON, Wash. (AP) - Think computers, only smaller.

So small you could swallow one or wear one in your long johns. So
smart they\'d fade into the background and you\'d notice only the
information you were getting, not where it was coming from.

That\'s the hope - and the promise - of wearable computers, the next
phase in the personal computing revolution, embodied in the
eye-catching array of devices displayed this week at a conference
sponsored by the Boeing Co.

Already, the Army has a computer the size of a pill that could be
swallowed to track the core body temperatures of soldiers on training
missions. A pager-sized alarm would alert the commanding officer that
a recruit was about to go into hypothermia.

Intelligent long johns

In San Diego, the Navy is building a ``sensate liner\'\' - an
intelligent set of long johns woven from conductive polymers that
would tell medics what was wrong with a wounded soldier and how soon
they should get there.

``It can tell the difference between a high-speed round and a bayonet
and, using reflective microscopy, it can tell if the soldier is
bleeding, and if it\'s a vein or an artery depending on the oxygen
content,\'\' said Eric Lind of the Naval Command Control and Ocean
Surveillance Center.

Although military applications were a major topic at the Boeing
Wearable Computers Workshop, civilian uses were also very much in
evidence.

Thad Starner of the vaunted Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology was one of several wired individuals wandering the hall.
His plastic lab glasses held a Private Eye, a tiny screen that hung in
front of his right eye like a jeweler\'s loupe, allowing him to read
off the laptop computer slung over his shoulder.

He was careful not to glance up at the screen when talking, but every
once in a while during a lull in the conversation, he discreetly
consulted his private information servant, which displays notes,
background information and his latest e-mail via a radio link to the
Internet.

Whenever he heard something interesting, he pulled his oval, hand-held
input device - called a Twidler - off the side of the computer, where
it\'s attached by Velcro, and took notes using a chordal system, in
which each letter of the alphabet is formed by pressing on several
keys.

Already, inspectors at an Air Force F-16 squadron in Ohio now call up
manuals and airplane schematics using a head-mounted computer screen
and voice-activated software, rather than consulting printed manuals.

And Marines are conducting vehicle inspections with the use of
wearable computer systems. Previously, two mechanics had to walk
around with clipboards, checking off more than 600 items. Now it takes
only one person and 40 percent less time using voice-recognition
software that allows the mechanic to check items off merely by saying
them aloud.

At MIT, researchers envision a world where the computer a person is
wearing would interact with its environment, plucking information out
of the air for its master\'s use. Scientists have already set up visual
tags throughout the lab that broadcast information to whomever looks
at them through a wearable lens.

``Water me\'\'

``We have a plant in our lab which doesn\'t get watered
appropriately,\'\' Starner said. ``A sensor on the plant notes when it
is watered and sends a message to the room computer. A month later,
the plant can send the message `I need to be watered\' and it would be
uploaded to the system so that anyone looking at the plant would see a
little note that says, `Water me!\' \'\'

At the University of Washington in Seattle, researchers are building
retinal scanning displays that would get rid of the need for
head-mounted screens entirely. Users would instead wear a little
projector just below the eye.

The projector would use an extremely low-power laser to paint a
picture one pixel at a time on the retina, at the back of the eye, in
much the same way a cathode ray tube paints and repaints the image on
a TV screen.

How to supply power to these wearable computer systems is still being
worked out. Batteries are heavy and need to be frequently replaced or
recharged.

At MIT, scientists are investigating the possibility of computers
powered by the human body. The military calls it ``energy
harvesting.\'\'

For example, a band strapped across the torso could use the movement
of the chest in breathing to produce enough energy to run a low-power
computer. Another possibility is an electrical system that would
enable a person to produce a charge simply by walking. "

Yep, the art is stunning. We\'ve come a long from William Kieth\'s line drawings, eh? I 
like the storylines linking some of the series of B&W drawings found in the book, and 
the Foss color art evoked a real sense of wonder. I kept asking myself: "What *is* this 
thing? Who made it? What does it do?" 

The ship designs are okay; just what I would expect from a product called "Traveller." I 
agree that designs would certainly evolve over the span of 1100+ years.

Didn\'t notice this one . . . but there are similar discrepancies between the text and 
tables. Notice the Magnum Revolver text said it did 10 damage? More than a laser rifle! 
I reported this one to the IG Errata Patrol. Good on IG for posting the errata on their 
page.

I\'d add the age-roll DM at a higher tech level, but I\'m pretty much in agreement with 
you. Yep, the Scouts are a little buffed, but the surviv, er, *injury* roll is 
relatively hard.

I happened to like TNE\'s task system -- a matter of taste, I think. I\'ll settle for the

I didn\'t import the DC stuff for my TNE game, and I didn\'t run any adventures with psi.

Same here in Lodi. I have a very good rapport with my local store, the Comics Grapevine. 
He gave me pretty much the same \'rap\' as the fellows at Gamescape gave you.

Especially these days, when any new RPG faces an uphill struggle. I know that Traveller 
isn\'t exactly new, but to the masses, it _appears_ to be a new product.

of "graphical" error (?omission of table???) but there was no further

     In addition, the softcovers were somewhat delayed as well.  I can\'t see

received the softcovers today 8/22/96 and are shipping it out to their chains
this evening.  So for those in NY, PA, and Boston, you should see it anytime
from Friday to Monday.
     If anyone has Arcane magazine, an excellent British RPG publication,
their September 10 issue features the first review of T4, I haven\'t seen it,
but would be interested in it.  Considering the full color cover, they
probably liked it.
     Speaking of full-color, has anyone seen the newest printing for the Star

impressive.  IG take note, this is the current standard of production.

I\'ve done several versions of my review of the T4 product, as many of you 
know.  However, I never felt free to fully explore the game system (I 
wanted to give TMLers a taste of it, not ruin their experience of 
exploring a new game system).  Nor did I feel free to give anything but 
an objective opinion (or as close to that as I am capable of giving).  
 
Now that the reviews are all done, and more people have T4, I\'d like to 
engage in a little subjective . . . what\'s the word . . . well, almost 
gloating! :)
 
I\'m so happy to see that more people now own the T4 rules set!  It\'s 
great that more and more of us are gaining this common frame of 
reference.  The discussions should become much more lively now that more 
people can be included.  I can\'t wait to see what we (individually, in 
groups, and collectively) come up with, based on this new set of rules!
 
Another good, recent event is the inclusion of the T4 Errata on the IG 
web page.  After going through and making the changes noted therein (and 
one other which was addressed in a brief email exchange with Matt 
Machtan), I\'m now well on my way to a perfect T4 rule set.  :)   I hope 
that, once the errata is complete, IG will arrange it with distributors 
and game shops so that an errata sheet is included with every copy of T4 
sold.  Might as well get purchasers off on the right foot and show them 
that IG cares.
 
I also want to join with the other owners of T4 in saying that this is 
truly a great rule set.  While it isn\'t perfect for everyone, I feel it 
is a solid basis from which to grow a game system that will offer options 
that appeal to each style of gaming.  Truly and honestly, T4 adheres to 
the vision of Marc Miller, as given here and elsewhere.  
 
It is definitely to IG\'s credit that they stayed true to the vision Marc, 
Ken, Don, and others have shared with us.  I cannot ask anything more of 
a company than to do exactly what they told us they would do.  After all, 
how many companies can honestly say the same thing?
 
All of this makes me even more impatient for the upcoming supplements.  
Personally, I\'m waiting most impatiently for the Central Supply Catalog 
and the Starships Supplement.  The Milieu books are important, certainly, 
but CSC and Starships are the two that make my mouth water. <G>
 
Here\'s to Marc Miller and Imperium Games, Inc., for putting out the best 
and most exciting Traveller edition I\'ve ever seen: May it sell more 
copies than any RPG before or since!

The ATV is just plain dumb, though.  Mag wheels?  No clearance in

And the lab ship drawing is goofy too.  It looks streamlined, and
the loop part has no function.

Hmmm.  I\'ll bet the Air-Raft costs 6,000 Cr.  Just a guess, but that\'s 
the only logical cost I can come up with considering the 600,000 MUSt be 
a typo, and considering the costs of other vehicles.

Personally, I\'m going to assume the aging rules are for TL 12, and use 
DM\'s for TL\'s significantly above and below that.

I like both the old and the new B&W artwork.  Of course, I\'ve attached a 
lot more memories and nostalgic feeling to Kieth\'s work, so I still favor 
it.

I\'m glad they chose to keep some B&W stuff in the new book.

The ATV struck me as a strange design as well.  It looks like some sort 
of a sports car, rather than a rugged all terrain vehicle.  But, I guess 
that at TL 11-12 they no longer require the rugged look in order for 
something to /be/ rugged. :)

Uhmmm....maybe the loop part is a way to radiate excess energy? :)

As I said before, I\'ll be using the old ship designs in my game.  So what 
if they haven\'t changed in 1100 years? :)  I now have enough invested in 
TNE ship miniatures that I\'d rather not buy a whole new collection of them.  

Then again, that could change if RAFM comes out with a new line that 
looks good.  Lord knows I\'m prone to buying just about anything with the 
Traveller name on it. :)

talking ridiculously simple here so let\'s not add every little nuance we
can think of.  <g>

We want to sum:

Sensor DM from Lock vs Jam Task (-4 to 16)
Size of Target DM               (8 or 9)
Fire Control DM                 (0 to 4)
Gunnery Asset                   (1 to ??, expect around 10)

  Anything else?

We could get very big numbers on the margin, (16 + 9 + 4 + 10) = 39

However we could also subtract some things:

Defending Ships Movement        (1 to 6)
Defending Pilot\'s Asset         (1 to ??, around 10?)
What else?
  There was a computer program in CT that assisted in Evasion,
  probably by randomly jinking the ship.  That should give you a DM
  of 2 to 6.
  
Anyway, let\'s look at a couple of examples.

Geeze Louise!  I enjoy my entertainment as much as the next guy, but take a
couple of these and an ID4 or two and we could *be* living on the moon and

Maybe, somebody should sell the movie rights for a *real* trip to the moon,

It\'s past that though.  I don\'t care what it looks like, but it

It\'s interesting to compare the two sources.  Adventure 1, The Kinunir, at 40:

"Imperial Warrant:  In some select instances, Strephon has been known to
exercise his power through agents rather than directly through the
bureaucracy of the Imperium.  These instances are rare, although there is
reason to believe that such agents are more numerous than appears.  The
instrument of power for such Imperial agents is the Imperial warrant, a
document on Imperial stationery containing statements similar to the example
shown to the right.

"Known uses for such warrants have included the establishment of colonies in
areas requiring development, the assumption of military power in the midst
of crisis, and the unilateral establishment of new noble lines to administer
provinces which have suffered from war or economic collapse."

Supplement 8, Library Data (A-M), at 32-33:

"Imperial Warrant:  Instrument of power issued at the highest levels of
government.  A warrant is a written or electronic document provided to
trusted agents of the Imperium as a method of bypassing the bureaucracy.
Typically, a warrant is provided by the Emperor to an individual who
utilizes the power it provides to accomplish some mission. Missions may
include establishment of colonies in areas requiring development, the
assumption of military command in the midst of a crisis, and the unilateral
establishment of new noble lines to administer provinces which have suffered
from war or economic collapse.  See also Imperial Edict 97."

I don\'t think it\'s off topic at all.  The characters in Trainspotting have
adventures and lives similar in many ways to the sordid, squalid, and often
short ones of PCs in my campaigns.  In fact, my current campaign involves
the sudden widespread distribution of an addictive, dangerous, psionic drug
in Jewell, Regina, and Aramis subsectors just before (and now during) the
Fifth Frontier War.  Will the main PC, an ex-Imperial Navy MCPO medic, and
his side-kicks, two Kforuzeng hoods on the run from Vargr justice, save the
Imperium from the Zhodani menace (if that\'s what it is)?  Or will he and his
gang just keep getting by?  Stay tuned.

Was this program for the Apple or the Mac? I\'ve recently come into

that was released for the Apple.

If that\'s what I think it is, a local store has several (used) copies
for sale, cheap. I doubt that they\'ll do mail order, but I might be
persuaded to buy a copy and ship it to you. (Sorry, but after getting
burned on some modules, it\'s either COD or *money order* in advance)

It also opens other fun possibilities. For example, consider the
warrant Cardinal Richilieu wrote in "The Three Musketeers". Not wanting
to advertise just *what* sort of skuldugerry his agent was likely to be
up to, he had to make it general, and all-inclusive: "By my hand, and
for the good of the State, what the bearer has done has been done."

This came back to haunt him when D\'Artangan presented said warrant when
asked just how he planned to deal with all the laws he\'d broken. "One
must be careful what one writes... and who one gives it to. <sigh>" 

Many Imperial Warrants will be subject to the same sort of "creative
abuse", especially given that they too aren\'t always going to *name*
the bearer, or just what he is supposed to be up to. :-)

True, but I was thinking more along the lines of having the front 
automatically raise and lower as needed, giving it more clearance.  Not 
probable, since they didn\'t mention that, though . . . :)

No kidding!  They need to get into the local phone book\'s yellow pages

there were no games stores in the local phone book . . .

Thanks for the info.  I\'ll look up their web page, and if it gives the

I\'d like to propose that for the simple version of RSSC (is that
redundant?), firing blind is NOT an option.

I\'d like there to be a range at which you can "see" your opponent, but have
virtually no chance at striking him.  Can we leave this range as "Out of
Range" and degrade the chance of hitting your opponent (with a Range Band 4
weapons only) to "staggering?"

I don\'t have a copy of T4 rules yet.  Are weapons categorized by range
bands?  If not, is someone planning to organize all weapons into range bands
1 through 4?  What criteria will you use (ie missiles are always range 4 and
pulse lasers are always range 3)?

So you\'re suggesting that detecting a target ship is the same as acquiring
sensor/weapon\'s lock on that ship?  Do we have consensus on this?  It\'s
different than what Eris was proposing?  How does T4 handle it?

Older versions of Traveller had an agility rating for ship\'s.  Perhaps it
would make more sense to use the agility rating of the ship as a negative
DM.  Or perhaps the difference in agility of the two ships could be used as
a postive/negative DM.

Takers??

Once upon a time, combat attacks were divided into two categories:

        4.1.2 Laser Attack vs Sandcaster Defense  
        4.1.3 Missile Attack vs Defending Laser Defense

Does your "target number" above (based on a range) include both of these
types of attacks?  If there is no difference, then we should no longer
distinguish them.

What is "Target\'s G Rating?"  Is this the same as Maneuver Drive rating?

Counter proposal:  gunnery skill + fire control rating - target\'s G rating -
target\'s pilot skill +/- sum of both ship\'s agility rating

I would like to remove "Sensor DM from Lock vs Jam Task."  Let\'s leave
sensor /weapons lock out of this.  Either you have lock and can fire or you
do not have lock and cannot fire.  Simple, remember?

Last I saw, these were the ranges selected for RSSC:

No Contact      - beyond sensor range, unsighted, escaped.
Out of Range    - In Sensor range, Out of weapons range.
Extreme Range   - In range of band 4 weapons.
Long Range      - In range of band 3 & 4 weapons.
Effective Range - In range of band 2, 3 & 4 weapons.
Short Range     - In range of band 1 to 4 weapons (all).
Contact         - Boarding only, no ship weapons may fire.

Care to expand your range to hit chart to include these?  (You do need more
things to do, don\'t you? :-)

So are you saying combat goes like this?

1. Attack attempts TO HIT
2. If (1) was successful, defender attempts TO BLOCK
3. If (2) was not successful, location of hit and damage
   is determined.

Why not combine (1) and (2) into an opposing roll?

Mark, there is an extension of the UPP (see _Spinward Marches Campaign_, 
_Regency Sourcebook_) that contains 3 digits for "The number, times 10, 
raised to the Pop digit from the UPP", number of planetoids, and number 
of gas giants in the system. If this population digit is 0, then there 
really is no population.

For example, Tavonni (Vilis/Spinward Marches 1520) is stated to have a 
UPP of:

E-567000-7	Lo Ba Ni	434	DD	G6 II	<---- 1120 data

The "434" is pop/belts/GG\'s. Tavonni has a population of 4 x 10^0 (ie. 4 
people - I have these down as a permanent Scout team). It has 3 planetoid 
belts: The Peanuts, Chips, and The Ice-Cubes. It also has 4 gas giants: 
Ryzel (around which Tavonni orbits), Martini, Vermouth, and Scotch.

[The remainder: "DD" = "Domain of Deneb" (allegiance); "G6 II" is the 
star type]

In T4, weapons are listed with damage values for each range band, like this:

L Laser Battery 4,2,1,0

this would mean that this particular battery does 4 points of damage at 
range 1, 2 points of damage at range 2, 1 point of damage at range 3, and 
no damage at range 4.

Hope this helps.

So you\'re suggesting that detecting a target ship is the same as acquiring
sensor/weapon\'s lock on that ship?  Do we have consensus on this?  It\'s
different than what Eris was proposing?  How does T4 handle it?

Older versions of Traveller had an agility rating for ship\'s.  Perhaps it
would make more sense to use the agility rating of the ship as a negative
DM.  Or perhaps the difference in agility of the two ships could be used as
a postive/negative DM.

Takers??

I would like to remove "Sensor DM from Lock vs Jam Task."  Let\'s leave
sensor /weapons lock out of this.  Either you have lock and can fire or you
do not have lock and cannot fire.  Simple, remember?

What is "Target\'s G Rating?"  Is this the same as Maneuver Drive rating?

Counter proposal:  gunnery skill + fire control rating - target\'s G rating -
target\'s pilot skill +/- sum of both ship\'s agility rating

Once upon a time, combat attacks were divided into two categories:

        4.1.2 Laser Attack vs Sandcaster Defense  
        4.1.3 Missile Attack vs Defending Laser Defense

Does your "target number" above (based on a range) include both of these
types of attacks?  If there is no difference, then we should no longer
distinguish them.

That was my idea, while Eris wants to add that step.  T4 does it the way 
I suggest.

I guess we\'re going to have to decide whether we want RSSC to be lesser 
than, greater than, or equal to T4 in complexity.  As it stands now, it 
is becoming far more complex than the T4 space combat system, IMO.

Now that that\'s necessarily bad.  We probably shouldn\'t call it RSSC in 
that case, though.

Last I saw, these were the ranges selected for RSSC:

No Contact      - beyond sensor range, unsighted, escaped.
Out of Range    - In Sensor range, Out of weapons range.
Extreme Range   - In range of band 4 weapons.
Long Range      - In range of band 3 & 4 weapons.
Effective Range - In range of band 2, 3 & 4 weapons.
Short Range     - In range of band 1 to 4 weapons (all).
Contact         - Boarding only, no ship weapons may fire.

Care to expand your range to hit chart to include these?  (You do need more
things to do, don\'t you? :-)

In the earlist stages of this project, Eris proposed (and I agreed) that 
we deal only with lasers at first, then add on the rest of the weapons 
later.  So, this first draft attack table that I proposed is concerned 
only with lasers.

So are you saying combat goes like this?

1. Attack attempts TO HIT
2. If (1) was successful, defender attempts TO BLOCK
3. If (2) was not successful, location of hit and damage
   is determined.

Why not combine (1) and (2) into an opposing roll?

You mean add a range beyond Very Long and No Contact called "Out of Range?" 
Where you aren\'t *really* out of range, you can still detect ships, but so
far out as to make it virtually impossible to hit them?

>...and degrade the chance of hitting your opponent (with a Range
>Band 4 weapons only) to "staggering?"

Not with staggering.  Unless we find some more DM\'s to cut down on Sensor
DM\'s and/or size\'s affect on the TO HIT numbers you\'ll have to go to 6d6 to
really make you chances of hitting at that range.

There are two things I\'m pondering now:  1) How to get the Sensor DM down
some (not a lot, but some); 2) more DM\'s to make it harder to hit a ship.


In the meantime, this is not an Offical RSSC proposal, but it might be a
good House Rule if you want *really* long range duels...

Long Range Combat
- -- 
Range           dice    Description
- ----
Contact*         --     No Weapons, boarding only
Very Short      2.5d6   Any weapons    
Short           3d6     band 2-4 weapons
Medium          3.5d6   band 3 & 4 weapons
Long            4d6     band 4 weapons
Very Long       5d6     band 4 weapons, smaller chances to hit
Out of Range    6d6     band 4 weapons, very small chances to hit
No Contact      ----     unsightable, no chance to hit

The Tasks are all harder and you have a small chance of hitting at
the extreme ranges with long range weapons.


*An Idea!  If this is for boarding, then maybe we should call it the
Boarding range instead of Contact.  Oh, and I think we need to
explictly state that in the basic RSSC you can\'t board a ship with
at working MDrive.

All the above is true.  <g> I *know* what I\'m proposing isn\'t
realistic in open space where one ship wants to \'run like hell\' and the
other want to close.  In that case the ship with the faster MDrive ought to
*always* succeed.  I don\'t oppose making that a rule.

However, all rules are subject to the GM\'s discression!  <g> So, if you
want to be a little less realistic or the ships were in orbit, ring, belt
(I *know* what a belt\'s like, but for game purposes it\'s just as cluttered
as the GM decides <g>) or whatever you could go one way, and if you wanted
to be more realistic and the ships were in open space you could go another.  
How does that sound?

  (DShip\'s_Size + AShip\'s_Sensor_Rating + AShip\'s_Sensor_Skill)
- - (DShip\'s_Sensor_Skill + Range_Mod + [DShip\'s_Jam_Rate] )
  ----  
            Sensor DM added to TO HIT
            
            
=============================================================

*Range SHOULD be included!  I don\'t know if the Range_Mod should
be included as number of dice to roll or not.  <G> My first thoughts
were a simple number based on the range like:

            Simple
Range       PropA   PropB   PropC   PropD
- ----
Contact       0       0       0       0
Very Short    1       1       1       2
Short         2       2       3       4
Medium        3       4       5       8
Long          4       8       7      16

Then I thought, "we don\'t have any randomness in the sensing task
yet, so I\'ll through some in", that\'s were the Range_Mod being based
on a number of dice came from.  If the defending ship\'s Size is used
in both the Sensor DM Task and the TO HIT task, the numbers work out
pretty well.  On average it should LOWER the chances to hit at the
longer ranges without raising them much at the shorter ranges.  We
*might* need to push the difficulty up one level too, but I haven\'t
had a chance to run many tests yet, so I\'m not sure.  

BTW, I think having the Defending Ship\'s size be on the Attacking
Players side of the equation (so to speak) is confusing, but that\'s
the way it has to work.

Here is a draft article about extrality. Upon reading this, you\'ll 
understand why I am opposed to forcing *all* \'ports to be 
extraterritorial. I firmly believe that only one port - and in some case 
only one *part* of a \'port, such as the orbital component - need be 
handed over to the Imperium. This is similar to the concept of "domestic" 
and "international" airports today.

I intend submitting this to IG, after some refinement. Please let me know 
what you think!

BTW, I now have a web page at http://pcug.org.au/~davidjw. This links to 
my "Links Page" - and then to (drum-roll!) my _Traveller Library Data_ 
pages. Very rudimentary now, but I hope to have more soon.

EXTRATERRITORIALITY

Introduction

The major basis of Cleon\'s Imperium is that it is a trade protectorate; 
that is, joining the Imperium brings a world\'s merchants and merchandise 
under the protective umbrella of the Imperial Navy. One of the chief ways 
of ensuring that travel and trade are protected has been to standardise 
many of the factors involved. These standards attempt to level the 
playing field, providing certain basic advice and protection for traders. 
Some examples are:

- - classification of planetary systems with a standard UPP;
- - creation of standard hazard warning labels;
- - use of standard regulations governing shipping, such as the requirement 
for annual maintenance.

Another way that Cleon has standardised trade is to introduce the concept 
of starport extraterritoriality. That is, a system\'s main starport is 
considered to be Imperial territory and not part of their homeworld. This 
allows standardisation of procedures, and allows the Starport Authority 
(SPA) to function Imperium-wide.

Creating an Extraterritorial Starport

When contacted by the expanding Imperium, a system may or may not have a 
number of \'ports. These may be actual starports (usually still-functional 
leftovers from the Second Imperium), or spaceports constructed by the 
home planet for its own in-system operations.

A pre-requisite for Imperial membership is to cede at least one \'port to 
the Imperium, which becomes the chief starport. The signing of the 
allegiance document transfers ownership of the \'port (and such adjacent 
land as has been agreed upon) from the home system to the Imperium. The 
latter now controls the starport\'s operations, personnel, regulations, 
finances, and so forth. The starport grounds are considered to be 
surrounded by an extrality line, and Imperial law prevails within this 
area. The SPA rates the starport facilities and publishes them as part of 
the system\'s UPP. Field facilities are maintained by SPA personnel - 
generally recruited from the local population.

Note that this does not prevent a system from having other starports. 
High population systems often have more than one starport, and these 
extra \'ports may or may not be extraterritorial. Planets may even have 
private starports, but only billionaires are able to afford such things. 
If other \'ports exist, they are usually only spaceports, and are almost 
certainly locally-owned.

Starport Laws

Imperial Law applies within starports. The law level is generally set at 
1, to ban the most destructive and insidious weaponry. Naturally, such 
devices may be stored aboard ship, internal ship security still being the 
prerogative of the ship\'s captain. All ships\' weapons are allowed, 
although there seems to be a move to regulate the usage of nuclear 
weapons. Nothing has been codified, but traders who carry nukes notice 
that the Navy and SPA are decidedly jumpy when they are discovered.

Imperial law is in its infancy. Of necessity it is generalised, as it 
covers many cultures. The law retains some basics to prevent anarchy, 
such as its classification of murder as a crime, as well as many forms of 
violence upon a person. Piracy and barratry are expressly outlawed as 
they directly affect trade. Other laws are expressed as regulations, and 
while still Imperial, may be more to do with local conditions. Dangerous 
activities are often outlawed, such as dangerous driving or flying, 
shooting off weapons in public, and so on. Often the local culture has an 
effect, and common sense should be used in framing such local regulations.

Wholesale disruption of trade is known to bring retribution from the 
Imperium, although no definite laws exist to codify the meaning of this 
term. In the few demonstrable instances of this type, the new Imperium 
has responded in different ways. When the ??? company stifled trade in 
the ??? system, the Imperium forced the company into liquidation by 
subsidising other merchants and providing patrol cruisers as escort 
vessels (ostensibly on "training missions"). However, it appears to have 
turned a blind eye to the activities of the sector-wide Tukera merchant 
line, currently involved in buy-outs of a number of smaller lines in the 
??? area. Whether this mixed response continues to be a feature of the 
new Imperium remains to be seen.

Legal assistance is available at starports of Type-C and above, at least 
for local matters. Interplanetary lawyers - those versed in Imperial Law 
- - are rarer, but there is at least one per Type-A or -B starport. Lower 
class starports must send away for legal aid, often taking weeks before a 
hearing is possible. Due to this time lag, the Starport Director has 
authority to rule on most crimes and all regulations. The Director, at 
their own discretion, can also hold people in custody, withhold exit 
visas, and impound starships. Appeals to higher authority are possible, 
but incur lengthy delays.

Starport Finances

Businesses with their head office located within the extrality line do 
not pay tax to the local system. Instead, they pay tax to the Imperium, 
which sets its rate 5% higher than the local rate. This prevents 
companies from using starports as tax havens. In any case, the buildings 
and land in the starport area are owned by the Imperium. Firms using 
starport facilities must pay rent, rates, power bills and so forth to the 
Starport Authority.

In turn, the Imperium considers its acquisition of the starport as an 
indefinite lease, and returns half of the starport\'s revenue to the 
planet. The SPA keeps the other half to pay for personnel, maintenance, 
and starport upgrades. Revenue consists of land and building leases, 
landing fees, cost of fuel, ship maintenance fees, possible exit taxes, 
and so on.

Extra monies, when present, are paid into the Imperial Starport Fund. 
This is administered by the SPA, in consultation with the Contact and 
Liaison Branch of the IISS. Starport Directors or the SPA Executive may 
submit funding requests for special projects. If approved, ISF money is 
directed towards the project. Additionally, the ISF is drawn upon to 
build new starports, repair damaged ones, acquire extra land, and so on.

Later Milieux

All the previous discussion has assumed Milieu 0. By Milieu 1100, the 
Imperial bureaucracy has made some minor changes to extrality.

Firstly, rare cases exist where a system\'s main trading starport is not 
extraterritorial. Generally, these systems are also Amber or Red Zones, 
and the starport rating is C or less. Sometimes one element - usually 
orbital - is extraterritorial, but the other is owned by the local system 
(often the case with balkanised worlds and multiple downports). Note that 
locally-owned starports can be commandeered by the local Naval commander 
in the event of an emergency.

The chance that a planetary starport is not Imperial is determined by the 
following table:

Starport Type			A	B	C	D	E
% chance of local ownership	5	5	5	10	20
Modifiers: Amber Zone and not Captive Government, +15%.
           Red Zone and not Captive Government, +25%.

The law level within a starport is determined by 1D-2, treating results 
less than 0 as 0. Even at low law levels, the open display of personal 
weaponry is discouraged.

Privately-owned buildings may exist within the extrality line. The land 
on which they stand is generally leased from the Imperium, with a 99-year 
term. Under a special agreement, TAS Hostels are exempt from paying a 
lease, but they must still pay rates, power, and so on.

The ISF is run on a sector-wide basis, with monies from the sector 
channelled back into the same sector. The Imperial Ministry of 
Colonisation may also submit funding requests on behalf of new or 
struggling colonies.

Could somebody with T4 tell me if there *is* an agility rating anymore?  I
can see using the Defending ship\'s agility to lower the TO HIT number.  I
don\'t think the Attacking ship\'s agility would have enough effect to
include it.

Maybe so, but our system might *play* pretty simple after we get finished. 
But even if it does get a little more complex then, how about "Reasonable
Skill-based Space Combat?"

I don\'t either, and not for lack of trying either!  <G> I\'m basing all this
on the designs that have been posted over the last couple of months, here
and on the other lists.  All the weapons seem to be listed with 4 range
bands, so I\'m assumming....<g>

>If not, is someone planning to organize all weapons into range

I think that varies with the weapon.  There are lasers that go out to range
4, but do progressively less damage.  Missiles, I\'m not sure about (Joe and
I are concentrating on Lasers first), but I think they are listed with
similar range band descriptions.

No consensus yet, I don\'t think.  I\'m still pushing the 2 step approach:  

Detection - you know it\'s there, so you *can* shoot at it, but you don\'t
yet know enough to hit it.  Simple Detection should be fairly easy, but
locating a ship with the precision to hit should be much harder.

Locking DM - determining the *quality* of your sighting on the other ship,
so you can add a DM to your TO HIT task.  The quality can range from a
negative number (poor chance), through zero
(better chance), into positive numbers (best chances).

No, no, no.  I don\'t want to add a new range.  I want the name of the range
just beyond detection to be called "out of range."  See below....

            Range Name      Weapons bearing         Sensor Task
            ----
            Contact         Boarding, no weapons    Easy
            Short           1 - 4 band weapons      Easy
            Effective       2 - 4 band weapons      Easy
            Long            3 & 4 band weapons      Average

            Out of Contact  out of range            Impossible!

When this chart was suggested, someone noted that if the sensor task for
"Out of Range" is formidable, then it really shouldn\'t be called Out of
Range, but perhaps Very Long.  My suggestion is to leave the name as Out of
Range, but make the Sensor Task Staggering instead of Formidible.  The idea
is that you are outside of the effective range of band 4 weapons, but you
can take a really wild shot if you want to.

I *really* like the idea of having a range at which you can detect but not
attack your opponent.  I think this will foster rp\'ing.  But I want it to be
very rare, desparate measures when someone attempts to attack his opponents
at the "out of range" range.  Do one of two things:

1) Don\'t allow attacks at "Out of Range."
2) Allow attacks, but make them Staggeringly Difficult.

>In the meantime, this is not an Offical RSSC proposal, but it might be a

No, I don\'t want really long range duels.  That\'s not my point at all.

As a matter of fact, I\'d be happy with only two combat ranges - short and
long (simple, remember?).  Do the types of weapons on the market lend
themselves to four combat ranges, as we have now?  Are there certain
military types of weapons that can be used on range bands 3 and 4 that
ordinary people can\'t get?

The name is purely semantics.  Change it if you want.  And I have stated in
the rules.

Note that I have been collecting all the info on RSSC and condensing it into
one file.  I\'ve been keeping all the info that we\'ve come to consensus on
and organizing it.  Later today I\'ll post it.

Ah!  Well then, if all weapons are like this, then let\'s keep 4 combat
ranges.  I also move to not allow combat at the "Out of Range" range.  And I
suppose my "Hey You!!" posting was a bit pre-mature.  I didn\'t realize that
you had a book, Joe.  Sorry all.

I\'m in favor of this.  See my posting of the why I don\'t think jamming
renders passive scanners ineffective.  BTW, does T4 still use the concept of
a passive and an active EMS suite, Joe?

I think it would be simpler to not have a quality.  Let\'s leave this as a
binary result:  it\'s either on or it\'s off.

General suggestion:  the less DMs that we have to keep track of, the faster
(and simpler) that RSSC will be.

multi-ship combat, but it can easily be condensed for ship-to-ship combat.

- ----

The RSSC System
- ----

Ranges
- ----

There are 7 abstract ranges:

No Contact      - beyond sensor range, unsighted, escaped.
Out of Range    - In Sensor range, out of weapons range.
Extreme Range   - In range of band 4 weapons.
Long Range      - In range of band 3 & 4 weapons.
Effective Range - In range of band 2, 3 & 4 weapons.
Short Range     - In range of band 1 to 4 weapons (all).
Contact         - Boarding only, no ship weapons may fire.

The initial range is determined by the GM (usually Out of Range).
Boarding is possible only if one ship\'s manuever drive is disabled.


Roleplaying
- ----

Roleplaying is be encouraged at each step in this process:  PC\'s may
attempt to communicate with the other ship; roleplay damage control
attempts, undertake Boarding actions (when possible), or anything
else they want to do.


The Process
- ----

1 Pre-Contact Detection Phase - The ship is routinely scanning and
may detect another ship.  A ship may not enter the next phase until
it detects another ship.

    1.1 Any ship using active sensors is automatically detected by
    all ships within sensor range.

    1.2 To detect another ship, complete detection task based on
    range as noted in Figure One.
        
        1.2.1 The active or passive rating of the detecting ship is a
        positive DM.
        
        1.2.2 The sensor ops skill of the crew member on the
        detecting ship is a positive DM.
        
        1.2.3 The size of the detectee ship is a positive DM.
        
        1.2.3 The jamming rating of the detectee ship is a negative
        DM.

                                Figure One

            Range Name      Weapons bearing         Sensor Task
            ----
            Contact         Boarding, no weapons    Easy
            Short           1 - 4 band weapons      Easy
            Effective       2 - 4 band weapons      Easy
            Long            3 & 4 band weapons      Average

            Out of Contact  out of range            mpossible!

2 Initiative Phase - Each ship rolls 2d6 + Leadership.  Highest
number has the highest Initiative.
    
3 Movement Phase - The three movement actions are:  Evade (move
away), Maintain (stay in same range band), Close (draw closer).
    
    3.1 Player with lowest Initiative states Movement Action for this
    round.
    
    3.2 Remaining ships state Movement Task in order of increasing
    Initiative.

    3.3 Determine movement results.
    
        3.3.1 If both choose the same task it automatically succeeds.
    
            3.3.1.1 Both choose Evade - ships move one range apart
        
            3.3.1.2 Both choose Maintain - ships maintain current
            range
        
            3.3.1.3 Both choose Close - ships move one range closer
    
        3.3.2 If tasks don\'t match then there is a contest to see
        which succeeds. (Pilot+Tactics+Md6)  vs  (Pilot+Tactics+Md6)
        Highest number wins, but ships with higher Initiative may
        concede contest.  Ties go to the ship with higher Initiative.

[Comment:  Making the ships with lower initiatives move first gives
the ship with a higher Initiative the advantage of seeing what their
opponents are doing before moving.  Also, notice that the ships with
a higher Initiative can *let* their opponent\'s action succeed.]

4 Attack Phase

    4.1 Ship with the highest Initiative attempts to attack.
    
        4.1.1 Attempt Sensor/Weapons Lock - Once a sensor lock has
        been achieved, it can be maintained unless circumstances
        drastically change (such as the pirate ducking behind an
        asteroid).  
        
            4.1.1.1 If target is actively scanning, then the
            attacking ship can sense target and lock on
            automatically.
        
            4.1.1.2 If target is passively scanning, then the
            attacking ship must make a task roll based on range:
            Sensor Ops, DM + Sensor Rating. 
            
            4.1.1.3 If target is jamming, then the attacking ship
            must make an opposed task roll:
            (SensorSkill+SensorFactor+?Die?)  vs
            (SensorSkill+JamFactor+?Die?)
        
        4.1.2 Laser Attack vs Sandcaster Defense  
        
            4.1.2.1 Weapon To Hit Resolution - Attacker\'s would add
            (Gunnery skill)+(Some Weapon Factor)+(Fire Control

            Surface Explosion Table (T4, p. 120).  Each Structure hit
            results in a roll on the Interior Explosion Table (T4, p.
            120).  Hits that take away the last of the Armor and then
            do damage to Structure get one roll on each table.  Meson

Yes.  The range bands correspond to Short Range breakdowns from
FFS/BL/BR.  The basis is SR10, so the ranges are 10, 20, 40, 80
hexes (10hexes=1light second).  Try to make your to-hit rolls so
that hitting a player sized ship past range band 3 is bloody
unlikely.

Missiles should close range over time (giving PCs time to plan ways
to shoot it down or spoof it (makes for neat role playing, IMHO).

No, no, no.  I don\'t want to add a new range.  I want the name of the range
just beyond detection to be called "out of range."  See below....

            Range Name      Weapons bearing         Sensor Task
            ----
            Contact         Boarding, no weapons    Easy
            Short           1 - 4 band weapons      Easy
            Effective       2 - 4 band weapons      Easy
            Long            3 & 4 band weapons      Average

            Out of Contact  out of range            Impossible!

When this chart was suggested, someone noted that if the sensor task for
"Out of Range" is formidable, then it really shouldn\'t be called Out of
Range, but perhaps Very Long.  My suggestion is to leave the name as Out of
Range, but make the Sensor Task Staggering instead of Formidible.  The idea
is that you are outside of the effective range of band 4 weapons, but you
can take a really wild shot if you want to.

I *really* like the idea of having a range at which you can detect but not
attack your opponent.  I think this will foster rp\'ing.  But I want it to be
very rare, desparate measures when someone attempts to attack his opponents
at the "out of range" range.  Do one of two things:

1) Don\'t allow attacks at "Out of Range."
2) Allow attacks, but make them Staggeringly Difficult.

>In the meantime, this is not an Offical RSSC proposal, but it might be a
>good House Rule if you want *really* long range duels...

No, I don\'t want really long range duels.  That\'s not my point at all.

As a matter of fact, I\'d be happy with only two combat ranges - short and
long (simple, remember?).  Do the types of weapons on the market lend
themselves to four combat ranges, as we have now?  Are there certain
military types of weapons that can be used on range bands 3 and 4 that
ordinary people can\'t get?

The name is purely semantics.  Change it if you want.  And I have stated in
the rules.

Note that I have been collecting all the info on RSSC and condensing it into
one file.  I\'ve been keeping all the info that we\'ve come to consensus on
and organizing it.  Later today I\'ll post it.

two more weeks for the hardcover.
   I shall read it through pretty quickly to give some thoughts about it,
though I must state that the presentation, layout, and artwork look mighty
good and the typos & errors noted to date really pale by comparison.
   I do note something interesting that people should ponder....
         In the ground combat section (pg57) where the discussion about
damage occurs, there is a statement new from any early Traveller edition:

     "Regardless of a weapon\'s damage rating, however, a character normally
takes no more than three dice of damage from any single attack. (Some things
such as shotguns break this rule.)"

I would like to know the philosophy behind this, realizing that the book
further explains that higher damage attacks tend to blow through the target,
thus wasting energy.  
    Exceptions should be made to this, as this seems to be a perfectly
logical rule only in the case of weapons that depend on kinetic energy for
the majority of its damage power (i.e. slug weapons and lasers).  But blunt
damage (i.e fall from a 100 ft height) as well as weapons that do not depend
on kinetic energy per se (i.e. the high energy weapon types like plasma and
fusion guns which fire bolts of superheated plasma that not only deliver
kinetic, but also thermal energy that "splatters" a target when hit, thus
distributing its energy as damage more efficiently... as well as
<<theoretically>> disintegrators which cause on effect on the specific target
that disrupts the molecular cohesion of the target to cause its damage {thus,
not a high kinetic energy effect} etc. etc.   There may be more examples, but
I think people should be aware that there will be significant exceptions
aside from shotguns, they just may not be addressed until these weapons
become available down the timeline of the Third Imperium (and beyond).
Combat should be deadly, and on the practical side, it promotes roleplaying
not recreating Rambo In the 46th Century.
    Anyway, more thoughts later.

Great!  I\'ve been hoping someone would step forward and take over the

    'body' => '  This past Monday, I went to my FNGS (Friendly Neighborhood
  Game Store) [Compleat Strategist, E.33d St. off 5h Av., NYC -
  plug plug] and looked around.  Now, this place bears a strong
  resemblance to someone\'s attic - very cluttered, but neatly
  stacked - just no indication of where anything is or how
  important it is.  But I like it.

  So, I go to where the Traveller material traditionally is, and
  I find Cyberpunk instead.  I then start walking up to the
  front counter, and as I pass the traditional location for
  GURPS, I find Traveller.  But no T4.  So, I get to the
  counter, and I look at the guy (who\'s on the phone).  He
  finished the call, and I say one word: "Traveller?"

  He says "Not yet".  I say "Gee, it was supposed to be in the
  stores by now, and they had the softcovers at GenCon." (The
  latter part of that based on what I\'ve seen posted here - I
  can\'t afford to take time off to go to both Pennsic and
  GenCon.)  He looks upset; it seems that they "should" have
  gotten it before IG was selling it at GenCon.  He mutters
  something about phone calls, and I leave.

  Fast-forward about 27 hours.  I\'m at home, and I\'m pressing
  buttons on my phone.  A very pleasant young woman (at least by
  her voice) answers, and I explain that my FNGS seems to be a
  little upset, and I\'m a little disappointed, because I don\'t
  have T4 yet, and neither do they.  I provide all sorts of
  pertinent information; she says that they _should_ have gotten
  it by now, and she\'ll get right on it, and oh by the way,
  there was a slight delay at the printers; you should have your
  signed hardcover within about a week.

  Fast-forward to Thursday, about 15:30.  I\'m in my FNGS,
  walking up to the front counter.  Same person behind the
  counter as on Monday, but this time with a puzzled look on his
  face.  I put down a copy of T4 on the counter, and hand him my
  VISA card.  He rings up the sale, and I casually mention that
  if IG keeps responding the way they did when I called on
  Tuesday, they will make a _lot_ of friends.  I also told him
  that I had mentioned our conversation of Monday to them, and
  she said she\'d get right on it.  He brightened, and said
  "that must be why she had all the information right there when
  I called."

  Conclusion:  IG has its act together.  Milky Ways (I like them
  better than Kudos) to them, and a strong hope that they\'ll
  keep it up.

  I was favorably impressed by T4; there are some minor
  production issues I wasn\'t ecstatic about - there were a
  couple of typography errors (as opposed to typos - I wasn\'t
  looking for them) and I think they would have done better to
  set the text in Optima instead of Helvetica.  I _do_ like the
  otherwise clean presentation (as contrasted with the
  gingerbread on much of the TNE material) of the material, the
  drawings aren\'t overly cluttered, and the color plates are
  _fantastic_ even if they _aren\'t_ the ships that we know and
  love from 1100.

  <snicker>  I\'m looking at the pictures opp. p. 84 - that
  Air-raft _has_ to be a Cadillac...

A heavy-damage weapon will either punch through the body or hit a bone on the way, 
breaking it. I think IG went with the simpler damage model to keep game complexity in 
line with the "classic Traveller" concept behind T4

I can see exceptions for  flamethrowers, frag grenades, flechettes and heavy 
weapons.  What about a soldier hit by a tank\'s main-gun APDSFSDU round? Major and 
significant exceptions are needed.

I know the conveyances looked a little strange. WHK and Brad McDevitt drew most of the 
best-known Traveller images of these things, and they have been given into the care of 
another artist. Still, I\'m not going to banish T4 to my shelf for minor artistic 
probs<g>.

Good military-action flick potential, all right . . . but Hollywood is going to murder 
the philosophical groundwork that made the novel an enduring classic. Release date: 2 
July 1997.

I can hear Sergeant Jelly now (chapter 1, for those of you who haven\'t read the book 
yet): "Do you know how much you cost the guvment, after training . . . not to mention 
how much you overeat, better than a quarter million dollars. Toss in the two cents 
you\'re actually worth . . . "

I just got a peek at a copy of SW: I\'m impressed with the artwork. Interior color is now 
_de regeur_ for game products. We\'ve come a long way from three booklets in a 
black-red-white box, from b/w line art and boring typography. 

As a grognard (gaming since 1969), I _can\'t_ laugh at how pretty products have become. 
Hey, if a product sells well, _it will remain available and supported_! Look at all the 
less-than-pretty late 70s/early 80s RPGs that are no longer supported.

In T4, at the beginning of the QSDS system tables section, the first 
table given is for "Additional Software."  Predict-1 through 5 are there, 
as are Evade 1-4, Gunner, Return Fire, Anti-Hijack, and Library.  [All 
other programs, presumably Jump-x, Maneuver-x, etc. are included with the 
ship when purchased - thus, no tables show their cost.]

So, yes, we do have Evade!

Good catch, Eris!

Uhhmmm.....I dunno.  Nothing in T4 indicates that any such skill is 
necessary.  [at least, not that I can find.]

There is no agility rating in T4.  Just an M-Drive rating.

You\'re welcome.  You and Eris have been doing most of the rules generating,
but I\'ve been asking questions hoping to get some clarifications.  I posted
a boatload of questions on Fri and got precious few answers.  I hope you and
Eris attempt to answer each one and come to a consensus.

Did the summary I put out state things well?

A few comments on the grav vehicles.  10gs at TL12, "and compensate
for it so that passengers feel only a slight acceleration, or even
none at all."  Grav comp is 3gs at TL12.  1g is about like taking
off in an F-16 (plus real gravity, of course).  I don\'t like using
gs to describe atmosperic vehicles performance, it gets way too
confusing, IMO.

I\'d rather see max speed (per atmosphere type) and some notes about
pulling gs in maneuver.  A fighter now can pull 9-ish gs, but can\'t
accelerate linearly at 9 gs.  Do they mean 10 gs _pulled_ before it
disintegrates, or 10gs linear acceleration?  See what I mean.

I have a related idea on antigrav for your perusal:  AG works to
provide propulsion now, right (air rafts, speeders, grav tanks,
etc.)?  With some hand waving we could allow the lateral propulsion
value (perpendicular to the gravity gradient) drop of rapidly with
distance from the surface.  The idea is that you\'d need nearby mass
in quantity around (in front of, behind, etc.) the craft to use it
for lateral movement.  This would mean that grav vehicles could
still get to orbit, but the lateral maneuver would be maximized as
altitude is reduced.  Grav tanks would be maneuverable at NOE, but
slow pigs at high altitude.  Seems like a neat way to make sense of
the way grav vehicles are vs. space craft, etc..

Shotgun, SMG.  Quoting from T4 page 37:

"When a cascade skill is obtained, one of its subskills must be chosen as a
specialty."

So if I get a Gun Combat skill, I could choose Rifle (1) as my specialty.

"...that expertise in this specialty can be used in place of any other
subskill in the cascade skill, at one lower level of expertise."

So when I get Rifle (1), I also get Pistol (0), Shotgun (0), and SMG (0).
And if get another Gun Combat and choose Rifle again, it goes to (2) and the
other three go to (1).

So one would naturally think that when a PC chooses a specialty (ie Rifle),
he would always continue to select that specialty, knowing that all the
other specialties are only one level behind.  Agree?

But get this:

"Should a character picks [sic] up another subskill within the same cascade
skill, his first point in that new skill is level-1, his second point
level-2, and so on, as normal."

Hey, isn\'t this really, REALLY stupid?  If after I pick Rifle to be my
specialty the first time I get Gun Combat, why in the world would I pick
anything else as a specialty the next time around?!?  If I pick Pistol the
second time I get Gun Combat, it would go to level (1), but the other three
would remain the same.  But if I pick Rifle again, then Pistol (and the
other two) go to level (1).  Anybody else get what I\'m driving at?  Am I
understanding these rules right?  Anybody from IG want to clarify this logic
(or lack thereof)?

you to use energy weapons (ie FGMP, PGMP)?

In the weapons section there are precious few military weapons (ACR and
Stable Gun Pistol).  So do characters in non-military careers who choose
Rifle learn to fire miliary rifles as well as non-military rifles?  I really
don\'t like that!  One of the defining characteristics, IMHO, about being in
the military is learning to use advanced weaponry that the rest of the world
rarely even sees (ie Gauss Rifle, FGMP) except in news clips.

Given that artillery and heavy weapons are skills, why aren\'t there any
weapons listed for these skills?  

This book really skimps on weapons.  Does anyone know if a more
comprehensive list of weapons will appear in the Central Supply Catalog?  If
not, let\'s all petition IG loudly for more weapons.  I\'m missing my gauss
rifle with RAM grenade launcher already.  :-)

If I get this right your basic problem is not that a character with a 
rifle of 4 has a pistol and shotgun of 2, something I would refer to as 
basic firearms familiarization.  Once you start to learn about one type 
of firearm you can\'t help but become passingly familiar with other types, 
not saying that you\'ve ever used one but rather that you\'ve developed a 
basic understanding of firearm mechanics and could probably figure out 
how to shot it and where to point the gun to get the effect you desire 
fairly rapidly.

Your problem is that upper line which seems to indicate that a character 
with a rifle of 4 and pistol shotgun of 2 who decides to throw specialty 
points into his pistol, he\'s become a cop or something, suddenly has to 
spend his first pistol point to get a pistol of 1 when he already had a 
pistol of 2.  

This is what your basic problem is with the system as presented right?

Gut instict tells me that\'s a typo, common sence would dictate that the 
character in the above example would spend that first point and get a 
pistol of 3 not 1.  Personally I\'d ignore IG\'s text as it seems to be a 
boo-boo on their behalf and substitue you\'re own ruling.  That is pistol 
become a 3 not 1.

Derek Wildstar made the same obersvation in a private email, and Eris and 
I are currently considering whether it is worthwhile to move the 
discussions yet again since it appears that everything is done with the 
pre-playtesting phase...or so it seems to me.

The problem came about when, several months ago, I asked someone what the 
"GDW-Beta" list was all about (via private email - this was before I 
had subscribed to it).  He replied that it was for "gearhead" 
discussions.  I asked what that meant, and whether I, as someone who 
enjoys designing rules, should subscribe.  He replied that, unless I 
enjoyed designing starships down to the last bolt it probably wasn\'t the 
list for me.  So, I didn\'t subscribe until the Starships for T4 firestorm 
was moved there.

>From that private e-mail discussion, I have carried with me a feeling that 
GDW-Beta wasn\'t for something like RSSC, which is decidedly non-technial 
and non-"gearhead."  

However, Derek just yesterday told me tha the true purpose of GDW-beta is 
the hashing out of rules, and that it was created in order to move those 
discussions off of the more general TML.  Since it is Derek\'s list, I 
assume he knows whereof he speaks. :)

So, in the future, I\'ll definitely start such discussions in GDW-Beta.  The 
only question is whether it is worthwhile to move RSSC there at this 
point, since there may not be too many additional posts made on the topic.

That doesn\'t sound real good in light of what I was pointing out earlier:   a DM
not being the same to different target die rolls.  For instance, a +4 to a target
of 7 (yeah, I\'m sure these aren\'t the right terms) on 2d6 is a lot more significant 
then on 3d6.  It would seem that if the _task_ system was defined well enough, 
that these would change the difficulty and be an unfair adjustment to the die roll.

Don\'t get me wrong, I will pick T4 up, and put more than this ideal thinking towards 
it.

That would seem to be the case here.

Battle Dress, as long as the firing character is in battle dress and the weapon (say a 
FGMP-12) _requires_ the firer to be in Battle Dress. The skill definition for Battle 
Dress skill, pp 39, says "The ability to operate specially armored vacuum suits designed 
especially for combat, including all the sensors and weaponry built into such a suit."

I\'d argue that since operating a PGMP-12 requires the strength augmentation found in 
(T4\'s augmented) battle dress armor, it is effectively part of the armor. Therefore,  
the battle dress skill, as taught to TL-12 troops, would include the ability to fire the 
PGMP-12.

Of course, this doesn\'t address the question of using HE weapons outside of battle 
dress, such as the compensated TL-14/15 weapons.

There may some merit to splitting off the "Rifle" part of Gun Combat skill into Combat 
Rifleman (remember _Mercenary_?) for selective fire combat rifles (CPR and gauss ACRs, 
"assault rifles," and SAW/GPMGs); Rifle, for semiauto and other "civilian" rifles; Laser 
for all small arms and SAW-type lasers; and High Energy Weapons for PGMP/FGMP weapons.

Not to mention SAW/GPMG, heavy machine gun, mortar, guided missile . . .<g

THAT was disappointing . . . listing the stats on a tracked AFV and not giving stats on 
the main gun, leaving it an impossibly vague "laser or missile launcher." What do I do 
when I want to run a military scenario that calls for an armed G-Carrier? Arm it with a 
laser rifle?

My RC players will scream if I take away their battledress and  laser-guided tac 
missiles, claymore mines, orbital-bomb, er, _strike_ (this _is_ the RC, after 
all!) missiles, etc. ;) My players really like military/mercenary adventures so I\'m a 
little stuck converting to T4 until I see some. I\'m going to send IG a letter asking 
them to include LOTS and LOTS of weapons in CSC!

On the surface, I agree with your bit of hand waving, Merrick. It makes scientific 
sense, given that gravitational forces between two bodies is inversely proportional to 
their distance from one another.

However, there is a problem: _spaceships_ also use a gravitic-based technology now for 
normal-space propulsion, and this idea has problems if it is extended to spaceships. 

It would also have some interesting tactical implications for lift armor deployment from 
orbit. The lower maneuverability of a lift vehicle deploying from orbit would make it an 
easier target for aerospace defense troops. Granted, tanks would be hard to hurt if hit, 
but eventually anything that can be hit can be killed. Dropping a tank unit against 
significant aerospace opposition would demand credible decoys to get them past the 
defenses, just as a meteoric assault does now, because now drop capsules and grav tanks 
are going to be (in relative terms) easy ballistic targets at high altitides.

While I\'m not known for my military campaigns, I do like to have a good 
range of weapons available.  You just never know when you\'ll need a TL 7 
Light Howitzer. :)  I guess I\'m just spoiled because I\'m used to having 
the huge variety available if one owns a great deal of CT products.  

Looking at T4 objectively, it is a complete RPG system.  One could 
certanly get by with what is there.  It is no less complete than, say 
first edition Shadowrun.  But if I don\'t keep that perspective, and 
realize what it /should/ be compared to, I end up comparing it to the 
whole CT system, and I feel like there are many huge chunks missing.

I expect the CSC to have everything in it.  The blurb about it does say 
that it will collect all of the already-published Traveller equipment 
into one place, and add new stuff as well.  

But if that\'s not the case, I\'ll be mighty disappointed.

Your comments, like last time, are absolutely true.  Nonetheless, I have 
run a few T4 combats now, and the system seems to work well enough.   The 
range of weapons and armor seems to be the biggest sticking point.  With 
the new way of figuring armor effects, and the paucity of weapons, it is 
difficult to come up with very many combinations that will make for 
exciting combat.

I tried using two people (777777 each), each with 1 level of Pistol 
skill, each with Flexible armor (armor rating: 5), and each with 
cP003\'s (damage rating: 5).  It was a boring combat.  The only way to 
spice it up was to try for double damage, but that made it almost 
impossible to hit.

I prefer combat with armor value:weapon damage ratio of 1:2 or so.  At 
this point, that just leaves Cloth (armor value of 1) and Body Pistols, 
Staple Guns, or Submachineguns.  [Yeah, I could use "Diplo," but that 
didn\'t seem like a type of armor that would be very popular in my 
campaigns.]

We need more armor and more weapons!

  Well, "all receipients" would probably have your message going to both the
list and a second copy to yourself as a Blind Carbon Copy (BCC) recipient. A
"reply to sender" will get it to everyone once from most mail programs. The
digests are automagically generated for the digest receipients from anything
sent to traveller@mpgn.com (and traveller@ns.mpgn.com too it seems), so they
won\'t miss out.

  Can\'t answer your second question about reprints, but I can guess. I doubt
that IG would announce it now even if it is planned, as it would cause
people to wait for the next printing, so leaving their current one on
shelves and not selling. We will probably first hear about it when it hits 
the streets.

Feel lucky your local game store plans on carrying it.  I went o my local
one, and asked about Traveller, only to be told that the company that
produces Traveller has gone out of business.  So, I told him all about
Imperium, and how Traveller debuted at Gen Con.  Well, then I received the
reply that \'I went to Gen Con and didn\'t see anything about it...if it comes
out we\'ll get it...\'.  Needless to say I may try and find it elsewhere
(anyone know of a store in the GTA with Traveller in stock?)

	The Mosquito Scout Cruiser was designed by ARW, as a study before

	studys as he realiesed that the TL17 AI was build with a similar
	aproach as the Cimberlayne chips. So ARW limiteded the AI for
	the Kinunir\'s what made a lot of well know problems, and later
	stoped military vessels at all.
<P>
	The mosquito is flying with reduced crew and is designed to
	work without a crew at all.
	Only 4 of them where build, one got mad at 1074 and destroyed
	several ships and a starport, before it was killed, the remaing
	3 served in Stephanons house fleet.

	When virus arived two of them changed their motivations by

	to fly for quite a while rethinking life and death,
	its origin and aims. It has reprogrammed it self
	and is now known as one of the brains behind some vampire
	activity. His nicname is general "M|cke" as he often join
	fleet with much larger ships.

<li>	1073 - The group get hired by Ling Standart to rogue ship design
<li>	1074 - The group get hired by a solomani (or zhodani if you prefer)
	intelligence agency to deliver a chip containing Akiri-Kurosavas
	famous films to a starport, where a new warship should arive. They
	should place this film inside the starships computer.
<li>	1075 - The group should visit ARW to give a decrete 97 that ARW
	has to stop Mosquito studys. They should deliver the remaining 3
	ships to a hidden naval base, and ensure that non of them get
	mad.
<li>	1132 - The group is serving in Stephanons fleet as virus arived.
<li>	1170 - M|cke visits the regency, he claims that he has a a grandchild
	of Stephanon on board. He is without a fleet and avoid fight.
<li>	1203 - M|cke visits Upsala, Montezuma, Kide and Bika with a trade
	fleet :
<p>
	2 Bastien + 1 Fiery (Empire), 3 brand new Jayhawks (Puppetier),
	1 Lab Ship + 2 brand new Eakau (Parents), 1 Chysanthemum (Peacemaker),
	1 Zhdits (Human crewed).
<p>	All ships have meat on board, so as long as nobody visits one (and
	sees the robots working) they look like a normal free trader fleet.
	The fleet will offer to join on a tour to Massila - a big profit.
	He is also interested in RC, and would travell there if RC offers

I guess I should feel lucky, but most of them won\'t be.  Games+ (the 
store I won\'t go to anymore because of their rediculous stance on the 
parodyish RPG "HoL," mentioned on this list a while back) will indeed be 
carrying it.  Gamers Paradise will not be carrying it, but will order it 
for me.  The comics shops, however, won\'t carry it and didn\'t offer to 
order it.  I think that\'s pretty bad news for IG.

Then again, we\'ll be going to The Game Guild up in Lake Geneva next 
weekend.  Considering who owns the store, they should have a rather large 
display of T4. :)

[sigh]  If he really went to Gen Con, he probably hung out at the TSR and 
Games Workshop areas.  :P  It\'s not like IG had a huge booth or anything, 
but they certainly were there and they did have their table filled with 
T4 books (and a mint copy of The Traveller Book (hardbound)).  

Sounds like this person has his head buried in the sand (or somewhere 
else). 

I wish these idiotic games store owners and clerks would get with it and 
realize that they depend on /customers/, which means offering those 
customers what they want, not what the owner wants to sell them.  It\'s 
great to hear the good stories about games stores from the TML members, 
otherwise I\'d dispair for our hobby.

I am very anxious for everyone here to get T4 and read it!

I don\'t think it\'s the *strength* the you need. Way back in the 3
little books days, the image that sprang into my mind was that trying
to use a PGMP/FGMP *without* battledress was a good way to kill
yourself. While it\';s mostly dangerous "downrange", being *near* one of
those when it is fired ought to be good for some damage if you aren\'t
armored. 

In support of this viewpoint, I note that I\'v\'e never seen an example
of something like a "pintle mount" for a FGMP! It\'s too dangerous. Sort
of like a recoiless rifle, the backblast is kinda unhealthy. Only in
this case, it\'s more along the lines of the "muzzle blast". :-)

Well, the energy weapons should require a different skill or skills.
But regular rifles shouldn\'t require any real skill difference. I
leraned to shoot on a 22. And shooting everything from a muzzle-loading
flintlock to an SKS or MAK-90 is the same skill. *Loading* a muzzle
loader, or maintaining *any* weapon breaks down into different skills,
but just shooting them is the same (except for the kick).

Full auto fire may be different, I have yet to get a chance to fire one
of those. But single shot is single shot.

> Given that artillery and heavy weapons are skills, why aren\'t there any
> weapons listed for these skills?  

The biggest difference shooting a laser weapon will be that it doesn\'t
"drop", but you\'ll still need to make sight adjustments for range
(unless you are willing to always have the shot hit low, by setting the
sight and "bore" parallel).

So as long as the laser rifle/gauss rifle/whatever has been sighted in
ok, you should be able to shoot it ok. Fusion and plasma weapons are a
different matter, but they are "heavy weapons". 

So short of having a seperate skill for every single weapon in the
book, I\'d say that just "rifle" and "pistol" are a reasonable
compromise. It\'ll sure help playability.

Oooh...that makes for a nice image.  Perhaps when/if Marc is able to make 
a Traveller movie, one of the characters can die a glorious death while 
holding off the enemies as the rest of the good guys escape, by operating a 
FGMP without battledress. :)

Hoo, boy is there an errata sheet! :)

Check the web-site at:  http://www.spirit.com.au/~jamesd/

That\'s where the TML FAQ is located, as well as lots of useful stuff such 
as errata listings, product listings, reviews, etc.  It\'s a web-site that 
should be in all Traveller enthusiast\'s bookmark listings.

Good question.  I\'ve only just got back into Traveller after a really 
long hiatus.  And I mean really long.  I like the sound of the Company 
name.  Mind you German names for things always have a cool ring.

BTW.  Is the Emperor\'s granddaughter in cold sleep or is she actually 
alive and awake.  She\'d be in her 70\'s by the time the new era came 
about.  How did Strephon get a granddaughter anyway.  I know people will 
ask.

Not sure, I think she would be in cold sleep but I dont have any canonical
material to back that.

Probably the usual way ;) Of course she and her parents could have been
invitro I s\'pose, but where would the fun have been in that?

Well ya, most likely, I mean, the guy I admit is not that bright.  However,
it\'s pretty annoying.  If I had gone to GenCon (I\'m hoping I will next year)
I wouldn\'t stand around only the games I play, I\'d try new things, and new
games.

Right.  Actually, this game store would not really get my business if the
only other one wasn\'t a comic store (it sells only Star Wars, AD&D and White
Wolf) and the only real game stores are 30 minutes away at least...and, this
problem is compunded cause I can\'t drive :(

I think these are the MrFusion units that Greg Porter has talked about on
the gdw-beta list.  It was my understanding that the units used in the
vehicles/small craft are going to have "problems" that won\'t let them be
used (commonly) to power starship systems.  Foex, I *think* they are going
to be listed as having much lower power/cc than normal Fusion+ units.  In
other words, they will scale down extremely well, but scaling up won\'t work
nearly as well.

It\'s kinda like that drug-resistant tuberculosis:  If you slack off on 
the extermination effort, they start having the spare time to negotiate 
"love moments" and then, once again, the population gets out of control.

As a new species of Traveller alien, these characters could be downright 
formidable...

I think that in once of the first three book, or perhaps Mercenary (book 
4?  I forget -- it\'s still in storage) it mentions that the uncompensated 
plasma/fusion weapons cannot be fired by \'unpowered\' troops.  In fact, 
the \'stock\' for those weapons is merely a big shock-absorber with a 
universal data jack at the end which plugs into the firer\'s battle dress 
at the shoulder.  Ever wonder what those wierd rectangular depressions 
near the shoulders that showed up in the illustrations of MT battle dress 
were?

Another point:  In CT/MT, if you bricked your firing roll really bad (or 
was it a roll against your Battle Dress skill?) will using an 
uncompensated plasma/fusion weapon, you could severely injure yourself by 
bending your shoulder in a way not originally intended.

While there is some thermal effect on the firer attributed to these 
weapons, it is typically sufficient for the firer to be wearing 
flame-retardant clothing if using a compensated weapon.  I\'d point out 
the page number in the TNE rulebook (or was it FF&S), but my whole life 
is in storage (I\'m moving this month).  Now, if you should happen to hit 
a target at point-blank range while just wearing your camo coveralls, I 
should suspect that you\'ll end up wearing some of the plasma splatter...

Are you talking about T4, or Fire Fusion and Steel (TNE)?  If you\'re 
talking about something in the T4 rulebook, I can\'t help you -- I\'m 
pinching the pennies so tight this month that I can\'t even afford to buy 
the softcover book \'til next month.

If, however, you\'re talking about FF&S, then I feel compelled to remind 
you that it\'s one of them \'alternate\' technologies that they included in 
the book but which isn\'t part of the \'official\' Traveller universe.  If 
you decide to use them, then it\'ll delight you to know that there is no 
minimum size for cold fusion power plants.  At TL-12, they put out 0.8 MW 
per cubic meter, so you just make them as big as (or as small as) you 
need.  They mass one ton per cubic meter, and each cubic meter costs 
Cr5000.  Cold fusion power plants consume two liters of ordinary water 
per hour per megawatt of output.  Hope this helps...

        Thruster plates are a different gravitic-based technology, working
more or less undiminished out to a certain threshold (for Sol system, around
3000AU IIRC -- chosen to deny the Kuiper belt as a refueling stop). Standard
contragravity diminishes much more quickly as the local G-field goes down,
so they aren\'t really useful for anything more than getting to low orbit.
100 diameters would take forever.

        This is what Greg Porter, Don Perrin, myself, & the rest of the SSDS
design folks hashed out back in May/June.

        Given the varying character sets on computers, we have to change it
to "Mueke" as the umlauts don\'t come through. To me it looks like "M|cke."

        Check out the fuel usage for the cold fusion and see how long you
can run a starship with a reasonable amount of fuel. That was supposed to be
the distinguishing characteristic and the reason why starships don\'t use
cold fusion.

        This dichotomy was forced on us by the "fusion+" thing that forced
us to multiply minimum powerplant size by 10 below TL 12. Greg Porter still
wanted 15G family speeders available, hence cold fusion.

        If you\'re still tracking, I went to two stores in CSprings today.
Heroes & Dragons informed me that there was no more Traveller, that GDW went
under. After I corrected them, they explained their distributor hadn\'t told
them anything. When their distributor tells them about it, they\'ll think
about carrying it.

        The Compleat Gamer knew about it, ordered a dozen, received four,
and sold them already.

Oooh, that would be a bad thing.  The original manufacturer\'s 
specifications must not be exceeded, or the warranty will be invalid!  As 
for a pleasant afterlife, you can just forget it if you void the warranty!

So, for example, your average UseNETter would be safe, then?

[stunned look]  "When their distributor...."  Huh?  Geez.  They may has 
well have said, "Well, we\'re pretty sure you\'re lying through your

That\'s a go example of how NOT to win customers and become profitable.

I\'ve gotta start a games store.  I\'ll make a mint!  All I have to do is 
treat my customers like intelligent human beings, and I\'ll be rolling in 
it!  Anyone know a good demographics researcher? :)

Good news, good news, bad news, good news.  It\'s good that they knew 
about it and ordered them, and good that they\'ve sold out.  But they 
ordered a dozen and recived four, eh?  I hope that\'s because their 
distributor underestimated demand...and not because IG underestimated 
demand.

It was _Mercenary_ where the issue of an unpowered trooper firing a high-energy weapon 
was raised. The data jacks for HE weaponry are made explicit in TNE for FGMP-12 and 
other uncompensated high-energy weapons.

Yeah...the G-carrier -- a craft that is is usually armed with a HE weapon carries 
something more along the lines of a enclosed cupola/ small turret than a pintle-mount 
MG. Not only is the muzzle blast dangerous, there\'s also going to be a significant 
hazard from ionizing radiation due to excited hydrogen plasma (or _fusing_ plasma, in 
the case of a FGMP).

A good ref should be able to get by without specific rules for "God weapons" by 
extending the basic rules to situations not covered yet. Example: RAM greandes. If you 
have Book 4 or MT, use the range stats therein, else use TNE . . . then consider the 
weapon\'s basic concept. An antiarmor RAM grenade, it should be able to penetrate the 
armor of a light AFV and totally Ruin The Day(tm) of anyone in TL-10 to 12 battle dress; 
a frag RAM grenade would be virtually the twin of the hand grenade already defined, 
except it is fired from a launcher with a different skill . . . .  

There\'s always the "avoid God weapon" option, too . . . .:)

Still, Joe, I\'m not going to _like_ all the improvising I\'m going to need to do while 
running.

That feeling -- the one you identify so well --  among us fans is why IG is going to 
release the major supplements on a monthly schedule into \'97.

I have _very_ high hopes for CSC. My hopes are so high that I\'ll not be disappointed too 
much if the book is released late _as long as IG publishes *all* the gear_. If they fail 
to be complete and rush the book into release, I\'ll be unhappy. I\'m expecting a preview 
in JTAS 26.

The problem IG seems to be facing is that comics stores (with a few heroic exceptions, 
like the one in my town) have been burned so hard on games (esp CCGs), and that the 
comics biz has been so terrible these last few years that store owners are being 
especially cautious about any new game.

Very true.  One of my friends is a comics fan who is pretty knowledgeable 
about the industry.  He\'s told me that some pretty weird stuff has been 
happening to the distribution channels (Marvel now distributes its own 
stuff, apparently, and won\'t let others distribute it) which, when 
coupled with the well-known CCG fiasco, does (as you said) explain comic 
store owner\'s being reticent about carrying anything that isn\'t known to 
be a big seller.

That\'s frustrating, but understandable.

I\'m trying to convince one local store to carry it.  I asked the owner to 
special-order a copy of T4 for me.  When I pick it up next week, I\'m 
going to try to whip up some interest in the game among whoever will 
listen to me.  :)   "Yes!  I\'ve been waiting for this game!  Look at 
these beautiful full-color pictures!  Did you hear game stores across the 
nation are selling out of this thing?"  Well, maybe not that extreme, but 
. . . :)

Heck, it\'s in my best interest to get stores around here to carry it.  I 
have to have /somewhere/ to buy the loads and loads of T4 merchandise 
that is soon to be pouring out of the numerous companies who are (or soon 
will be) liscensed to make official Traveller items. :)

Too true.  I hope IG sticks to the schedule outlined in Marc Miller\'s

[sigh]  Thanks for reminding me of the other things I\'m dying to get, 
Rich. :)  JTAS, the Citizens of the Imperium club materials, . . .

The good thing is that IG has two products planned for December.  That 
means two lucky relatives will have the opportunity to buy Traveller 
stuff for me as Christmas presents. ;)

I\'ve recently acquired several dozen TNE-era Traveller starship 
miniatures by RAFM.  While I\'ve painted a few hundred fantasy miniatures 
in my time (long ago), I\'m new to starships.  I need some assistance from 
those who are more experienced with this sort of thing.

Since it has been so long, I had to purchase all new paints (went with 
Armory brand - bought 24 w/ a case at Gen-Con, then bought 20 more via 
mail order), brushes, primer, matte finishing spray, etc.  But I\'m still 
rather unsure how to proceed.

My main problem is in color choice.  Now, obviously I could just go with 
whatever I like.  I\'m torn between "Iron" (a nice, dark, metallic color) 
and "Insignia White."  I\'ve done a figure with each, and both look 
equally nice.

Any advice for what looks best as the base coat?

The biggest problem I\'m having is in painting the details.  /Should/ they 
be painted?  Or are the ships simply monochromatic?  If they should be 
painted a different color than the rest of the ship, should I stick with 
black, or is it the normal procedure to go with other colors?   Primary 
colors?  Subdued or bright?  Sheesh!

Fantasy was easy.  Keeping the ships from looking boring while not 
looking garish is proving difficult, though. :(

Any advice or assistance would be greatly appreciated.


- -Joe

P.S.  I only have CT and T4.  CT has B&W pictures which are no help at 
all.  T4 has B&W drawings of the ships included, and Foss color art of 
ships I\'ve never seen before...not much help there, either.

My suspicion is that the economical $25 pricetag was achieved by a
huge initial print run. I wouldn\'t count on a new printing for a
while, unless everyone follows the practice of buying 4 or more
copies.

It seems to be doing much better in the west than anywhere
else..distribution wise, but that could be a mis-preception based on who\'d
reported that they\'ll gotten it.  Paul reported T4 in southern Mississippi
yesterday, but I haven\'t seen it and I\'m about 100 miles east of him.  I\'ve
got 2 stores that say they\'ve got it on order, but they are still talking
"end of month."  That\'s getting pretty close now. <g>

Joe,

That\'s where we have the problem. The problem is that *most* of their
customers want T$R, White Wolf, and card games (e.g. Magic), not new games
or games that require extensive thinking. Why even try something new, when
you can get supplement after supplement of predigested pap. (BTW, to quell
protests, I own quite a bit of AD&D and WW stuff, I just steal the concepts
and the rules for "better purposes".) We have several games stores here in
Minneapolis and St. Paul, some better than others. The last time I made the
rounds, the majority of the players were well under 20 and either going
over the latest from T$R and the newest magic set. Checking out the
tabletop gamers, most where arrayed with the latest from GW, painted just
like the figures do in White Dwarf ("Sounds of lamentations for the old
days of White Dwarf, you know, when it was a gaming mag, not a slick ad").

It actually is reminiscant of the computer industry in the early-mid
eighties. There were a bunch of operating system, a number of producers of
hardware and software. Now, there seems to be Microsoft and Apple for the
mainstream, UNIX for the "elites". Hopefully, more gamers will migrate to
games are more diverse or that require more imagination (e.g. Traveller,
Torg, Call of Cthulhu). I\'ve played great AD&D games, but they have been
those where only the framework has been taken and the latest/greatest arms
race has been ignored and something has been built from the tools.

Well, this has been rather disjointed, sorry for being fuzzy, but I\'ve not
managed to put it it to words properly. Maybe what we need to do is find a
good way to expose good players to new games, help the munchkins grow up,
and renew interest in the good games, not the predigested pap.

Oh Joe, it\'s not like most retailers *ever* believe their customers.

Unfortunately, most retail employees don\'t really care about
profitablity, they just want their paycheck.  As far as customers go,
they\'re just more work.  Haven\'t you ever been studiously ignored by
clerks?  Now, *owners* are a different story. <g>

Actually, I hope IG underestimated demand too!  I hope they sell their
production run out and have to order another run right away. I also hope
they have plenty of ready capital to cover a very fast runup of production
costs.  They\'ve got ?6? more products to get into the channel by the end of
the year! <G>

Distribution seems pretty spotty with lots of stores still not getting
their copeis, and it appears lots of stores are getting fewer copies than
they ordered too.  I suspect IG has enough product to fill the channels, so
it\'s probably the distributers holding back on orders.

Book 4, Mercenary, at 37-38, describes High Energy Weapons.  Regarding
recoil for the PGMG-12 (which we always call the PGIP here in Berkeley
(Plasma Gun, Individual-Portable), so as not to be specist nor sexist), it
says, "Because of the considerable recoil, the PGMP-12 may only be fired
every other combat round."  The PGMP-13, however, "may only be fired by an
individual wearing battle dress and only when the firer is stationery and
firmly braced in one of several standard firing positions.  This allows the
suit\'s normal strength enhancements to function as a recoil carriage.
Instead of a conventional stock, the PGMP-13 has a recoil cylinder
terminating in a computer link to the battle dress.  The computer link
engages when placed in the PGMP socket integral []to the battle dress...."

The PGMP-14 "incorporates a gravitic field generator which enables personnel
not in powered armor both to carry the weapon and to fire it, since the
weapon\'s computer system automatically biases the field to provide near
total recoil compensation."   

The FGMP-14 does not have a gravitic field generator, and can only be fired
by personnel in battle dress, much like the PGMP-13; the FGMP-15 is similar
to the PGMP-14.  

So there\'s no mention of thermal backblast, just recoil.

High energy weapons may not be fired at targets at Close or Short range
(Book 4, at 50), for exactly that reason (likewise HE weapons).

Heh.  On the one hand, they are /games/, so I can sorta understand the

when you use more of your intelligence, why would you want to go to the

On the other hand, it\'s just yet another example of how darned

Yes!  I started buying White Dwarf just at the tail end of the magazine

for Warhammer.

That\'s a good analogy.  I certainly hope the gaming industry doesn\'t end 
up like the computer industry!  We\'d have T$R as Microsoft, White Wolf as 
Apple, and Magic as the Fisher Price/Mattel "let\'s pretend" laptop 
computers.

Hmmm.  I guess we could run through T4 at gaming stores that offer space 
for such.  Demonstrate it, I guess.

Any other ideas?

I know, it\'s sad isn\'t it?  I guess my experience with Games Unlimited in 
Walnut Creek, CA has given me a warped image of the gaming retail 
industry.  They were /so/ good.

An example:  My best friend and I spent our paper route money ($80 or so) 
in that store every month.  The owner knew us because of that.  One month 
we came in there and bought our usual load of games, then started looking 
at the dice.  The previous month, we\'d gotten Champions, so we needed a 
whole lotta D6\'s.  (At the time, we each had only the dice that came with 
the games we\'d bought, so "a whole lot" of D6\'s was less than a 
dozen.[G])  The dice were on a shelf on the wall behind the counter, so 
we told the owner which we wanted.  He pulled them out of the jar, and 
let us know they were free!

Well, that was pretty impressive to us, let me tell you! :)  They were 
friendly and helpful to 13-year-olds for one thing, but being given 
something free was icing on the cake.  That definitely solidified our 
relationship with that store.

I never bought a single gaming item from any other store, until I moved 
out of state.

I\'m not saying all store owners should give away merchandise.  I just 
wish they\'d follow the spirit of that example, and make the effort to 
build a relationship with customers.

What you say is true, but when we\'re talking about a gaming store with 
what, maybe 3 employees, it isn\'t unreasonable to expect the owner to 
make sure all of his employees treat customers right.  That is part of 
the responsibility of being the owner of a business.  Fail in that, and 
you\'re giving profits away.

    'body' => 'I bought my copy of T4 last saturday morning and after glancing through it
breifly was fairly unhappy with it.  My first impression was that the color
artwork was horribly unoriginal and where there was original art is was fine
EXCEPT for the ships and especially the weapons art.  I\'d hoped they would
have been on a par with the technical drawings in 2300AD, or at least been
less cartoonish.  It was very obvious that the artist (who was perfectly
fine on most of the illustrations) had no experience with real weapons.  I
know I\'m being nit picky here, but I did pay $22.50 for a book that I
suspect will start falling apart in no time flat.  (The shotgun appears to
be a left handed bolt action _with_ a pump action on top of the barrel, the
auto pistol appears to have a recoil spring guide rod above the barrel, the
laser pistol looks like a hollywood prop made in the 50\'s from an old
Craftsman drill, the revolver is so funky looking that you have to wonder if
it\'s supposed to be a lighter.  The body pistol looks like one of those
little collapseable hand held hair dryers...Of course, the foil is the most
unweildy looking sword I\'ve seen drawn yet - is that supposed to be a basket
hilt?)

The skill lists under careers seems to be missing the italics, bolds, and
asterixes mentioned later in the skills chapter...

It took me a couple of tries before I realized how the skill assets worked,
which was an improvement over the CT, in my opinion.  I haven\'t had a chance
to read the whole book through and through, but I can already see how this
system is going to be extremely light on the mechanics and that it will be
fine for the GM\'s who are want to focus on story and pace over detail...

Just wanted to rant and rave a bit and be obnoxiously picky about the art.
As far as the game itself, I can see that the original CT fans will love
it....I bet you can\'t tell I\'m a diehard 2300AD and TNE fanatic...  :)

Anyone have an errata yet???

I remember Enterprise 1701 from back when I  was stationed at NTC Orlando in 1977-78! 
What a great store it was even then. I used to _walk_ there from the base (several 
miles!), and it was there that I bought my first copies of D&D and Classic Traveller 
there, as well as Ogre/GEV and lots and lots of other stuff.

I guess you always remember your First Really Good Game Store ;)

If you like mutant math tests . . . :) hey, my players _liked_ designing custom 15mm

I\'d like a systematic conversion system, too. Maybe there will be one in CSC or JTAS 
(grrr...), but one is not provided in T4.

I know all about this from my FLGSO. He\'s a frustrating situation for him. Since comics 
stores _are_, in small towns like the one I live in (~50K population, with 100K+ 
population centers 20 minutes away), the de-facto game stores, the distribution wars are 
going to hurt the stores. I wonder if this is a plot like the one Games Workshop has 
been rumored to be hatching?  GW now distributes its own line, just like Marvel (DC 
Comics go through an exclusive distributor now, too). In a few years, GW, according to 
speculative rumor, analyzes the sales data and picks, based on the data, locations in 
which to open its own stores! GW _is_ a store chain in the UK and parts of the US now, 
so the reasoning goes, why not complete the vertical integration of the industry? 

The implications for Small Local Game Stores are frightening.

I managed to do that for TNE by _running a game in the store_. My FLGS has gaming space, 
and I put it to use for TNE. Time to do the same with T4.

You can always add "If _you_ won\'t get T4 merchandise for me, I\'ll take my custom 
elsewhere!" There\'s no better way to get a businessman\'s attention. Unless you don\'t 
really have an elsewhere. ;)


What\'s this about liscensed products coming out soon? I hope IG and Marc adopt GDW\'s 
late-70s CT licensing strategy (liscense small startups to make goodies that grap store 
shelf-space and increase exposure . . . ) to T4.

Funny, I keep hearing a kind of Jimminy Cricket in my head that tells me "It\'s _my_ 
fault" when PCs think "dressing formal" means wearing their combat-armor tuxedo instead 
of casual battle dress to tea . . . but when I try to get them to think "subtle," 
the players revolt (it happened once . . . .) So I give them combat-heavy adventures, 
and ol\' JC keeps yakking in that voice only I can hear;)

Yes, I\'m hoping that IG sticks to the schedule and maintains the quality they have shown 
so far with T4. The monthly release schedule has advantages: (1) It makes business sense 
for a small game company trying to expand, pay the bills, and maybe make a profit in the 
meantime; (2) The fans aren\'t disappointed by long waits; (3) Frequent releases mean 
frequent reviews means more name exposure to the gaming public means more goodies for us 
to snap up;)

Sorry about making you so wistful, Joe ;) I\'m going to order my _Citizens_ stuff and 
register my character, LtCol. Wu Li, Aubaini Marines, (rtd), callsign "Kung Fu," newly 
converted over from TNE (not too difficult). I\'ll type up Li\'s character sheet and post 
it sometime.  As for JTAS, I\'m having my FLGSO (Friendly Local Neighborhood Game Store 
Owner) get it on comics-saver/standing order for me, just like he does for _Shadis_ and 
comic books.

Lucky you. My relatives think gaming is some kind of wierd  mind-control cult, and that 
by buying non-gaming stuff for me, that I\'ll be "saved" from gaming\'s pernicious 
influence.

  Thus has been demonstrated, not once, but THREE times locally. There\'s a
well-known gamer indivivual who\'s made a career of selling gamer material
and has for many years worked for minimal compensation (fwiw, he now owns
his own store) in other peoples\' businesses. Each time he was hired on,
the owners of said businesses became the beneficiaries of a large consumer
base who knew him and appreciated his gamer expertise and business acumen.

   Time and again, the same thing happened: business would go well, until
a blip in the economy happened and they ignored his advice or otherwise
laid him off, etc. This forced him to consider other options for
employment and yet another business owner becane the beneficiary of his
expertise while the previous shop\'s game business takes a dive. Finally,
one owner got wise and helped him finance another shop in another
town close by while still retaining him as a buyer.

  Funny thing was, the other shops NEVER clued in. Taking the loss in
business as "proof" that he was wrong and they were right.

Heck, some of the folks I hang out with want to buy the current
"equivalent" of a crunch gun and rag it along to our "plinking" trips.
Given that we already have everything from .177 pellet rifles up to SKS
"assualt rifles",  plus various shotguns and pistols it won\'t really be
noticed much. :-)

Seriously, some of the bolt action .50 cal rifles being sold right now
would seriously inconvenience high tech troops. 

Consider the "fun" of trying to invade a planet with a scattered
population (say something like Alaska, the Yukon or the Northwest
Territories) and some native "nuisance" animals along the lines of a
grizzly crossed with a wolverine. 

*Everyone* will have rifles capable of punching holes in battledress
given the right ammo.

If those are their plans I hope they get to the point where they have
enough "slack" built into the schedule to allow for "holding back" a
product for more testing or editing if needed. No rushing things to
market just to meet a schedule.

        Unfortunately, they did go back to fixed range bands for everything.

        Well, the original intent was that NOBODY have decent small craft
prior to TL12. That was to provide the "hook" that gave the nascent Imperium
a boost. Unfortunately, they didn\'t think things out well enough -- if you
can have a 15G speeder, you can certainly have a 15G fighter.

Not necessarily.  If the speeder requires a planetary mass nearby...
Hmm, what about saying gs as stated are for sea-level use on a 1 g
world.  Use it on the moon, and the accel. drops to 1/6, on mars,
1/3, etc..  The 15g fighter would do
15*acceleration_of_gravity_at_this_altitude.  By the time it gets to
orbit, it\'ll be doing "normal" g loads.  The real problem is
g-compensation.  That can\'t be broken regardless.

Then factor in aerodynamics.  Regardless of thrust, it can\'t go too
fast or it\'ll come apart due to pressure/temp. loading.  Add to that
that it\'ll leave the atmosphere after a few seconds at that accel.
and be on its way to whatever max limit grav tech works (100
diameters, right?) and things look better.  At worst you get *nasty*
interface fighters... but is that a bad thing?

        But if you have a deep-space thrust agency that requires power, it
won\'t care too much whether it gets that power from "hot fusion" or "cold
fusion" unless it\'s something like HEPlaR. At TL11, you get thruster plates.
So if you can build big ships with hot fusion, you can build little ships
with cold fusion. The little guys will suck down fuel much faster, and hence
have a more limited endurance. But who wants to be stuck in a fighter for a
whole year (standard endurance for "hot fusion").

        So the TL11 guys _can_ build fighters and other small craft. Which
was the whole idea fusion+ was supposed to prevent -- prior to TL12 nobody
was supposed to be able to build anything smaller than about 100Td and still
have room in it for anything but the powerplant.

Very true.  If TSR follows suit, then all the big names will have their 
own distribution channels...and possibly their own stores at some point.  
Imagine going to three different game stores so you can buy what you want!

That was just speculation on my part.  I don\'t know of anyone who 
actually has products for T4 in the works (except for the Silent Death T4 
Space Battles that was mentioned here by Dave Golden).

I agree, they should test things more.  Hopefully, they\'ll have their 
labor distributed properly, and therefore they\'ll be spending months on 
each release, but each release will have a different group working on 
it.  (This is what Intel does - several years ago, group "A" was working 
on the 486 while group "B" worked on the Pentium.  Once the design of the 
486 was complted, group "A" started working on the Pentium Pro.)

Since they have each product assigned to a specific individual (Don 
Perrin on Starships, Greg Porter on CSC, etc.), this should be the case.

    'body' => 'Howdy,

Tonight I found a Friendly Local Game Store...finally!

As mentioned several times previously, I\'ve been trying to find a good 
games store here in NE Illinois, but to no avail. 

Today I wanted to stop at a hobby shop and pick up a 000 brush and some 
other miniatures painting supplies.  So, I picked up the phone book and 
looked up the number for the local hobby store.  I called....it rang and 
rang and rang.  Apparently, they\'re closed on Mondays. 

So, I decided to check for other hobby shops in my area.  I scanned down 
the "Hobby Retailers" listings, and found "Friends\' Hobbies" in Waukegan, 
IL (which is only a few minutes from where I live).  The little 
yellow-pages ad stated they sold dollhouses, models, painting supplies, 
miniatures, wargames...and role-playing games!

I\'d always looked for games stores under "Game Retailers," so I\'d missed 
this one.  I decided to give it a try.  It probably wouldn\'t have a 
greater selection of RPGs than the comic shop, but it should have the 
painting supplies I needed.

Carole and I made the trip right after work (well, not /right/ after - 
there was the little matter of my muffler falling off on the way home. 
:(  Luckily, I live close to a Midas muffler shop, so I was able to have 
it taken care of by 7:00, early enough to get to the hobby store, which 
closes at 10:00).  

When we got there, we saw a small building that didn\'t look too 
promising.  I figured we would be disappointed.  Boy, was I wrong!

The first good sign came when I saw a cat just inside the door.  Anyone 
who likes cats can\'t be all bad. :)  When we got inside, we found it was one 
of those stores that are so /packed/ with goods that there is hardly room 
to walk.  They have /everything/!  Huge displays of paints; thousands of 
miniatures; hundreds of RPG games and supplements; tons of wargames.  
What a find!

I asked the owner (Robert Bigelow - some of you may recall his byline 
from the numerous reviews he did for Dragon Magazine several years ago) 
whether he had T4 - and he did!  Several copies!  He also had many of the 
RAFM TNE miniatures, and I was able to buy the few blister packs that RAFM 
doesn\'t stock any more. :) :)

I also picked up a minatures case, a nice 000 brush, and Carole got a 
very nice B-17 miniature.  Everything was discounted by about 10%, too!  

I was impressed, to say the least.  As an acid-test, I asked whether he 
carried HoL.  He does!  I got no lectures from him about the 
unwholesomeness of that game, either (unlike my experience at Games 
Plus).  ;)

Carole and I talked to the owner for about 1/2 an hour, then he had one 
of the guys who were hanging out there show us the club room.  It is 
an 1100 square foot room, with an extensive library (with board games, 
RPGs, wargames, miniatures, and scenery), a kitchen, 6 large tabletops 
and 2 HUGE tabletops.  Very nice!

As I said, we were impressed.  This is definitely the place I\'ll be 
spending my gaming dollars from now on. :)

Didn\'t we just have this discussion a few months ago?  I think it was right
after feudal technocracy and just before rock dropping.  Don\'t get me wrong;
I enjoyed the painting discussion, and am happy to start again.

I think that we came to the following (admittedly pedestrian) conclusions:
Ships engaging in space combat would ordinarily be matte black, possibly
with a few white specks.  Ships involved in military or covert operations on
or near planetary surfaces would be camouflaged appropriately to the planet.
Merchant and civilian ships could be painted in any color scheme, depending
primarily on the owner\'s whim or corporate policy, as applicable.  That does
leave it wide open.

>My main problem is in color choice.  Now, obviously I could just go with

Joe, you appear to have some aesthetic problems.  I recommend that you try
several different approaches, then scan them into your web site so that we
can vote on the best ones.

One approach that I\'ve taken for camouflage has been to go out into nature
and try to duplicate the colors present there.  For example, I painted a
metal toy fighter plane in various shades of gray to match the rocks on the
beach at Point Reyes; it looks great today, and was nearly invisible at the
beach.  The bark of the London Plane Tree is also inspiring, as are the
colors of the desert (sage grey, dark red-brown, yellows, etc.) (I\'ve lived
in Idaho and Utah).  

You don\'t need to limit the use of natural colors to camouflage situations,
but can also apply them to civilian ships.

As far as painting details, by which I assume you mean hatches, weapons
systems, etc., I usually pick some of them out in some way, depending on the
ship.  For example, the RAFM Type S Scout is too small to do much detailing;
I just painted it flat black, put white dots on the maneuver drives, and
added an Imperial sunburst (red for Scouts).  On larger models, I\'ve used
metallic colors for some outside details (which looks good on matte black)
like guns, but also earth tones and grays for bits of hardware.  I usually
paint bridge viewports yellow-green (like on the SDB).  

I try to avoid using too clashing colors to pick out details on ships (even
Vargr ships), but sometimes use them on aircraft or small craft models.

Dry-brushing is another technique worth mastering.  You can improve the
depth and texture of a model by lightly brushing a very dry brush with just
a little paint in a slightly lighter shade of the base color across textured
areas.  This helps even matte black ship avoid looking dull.

You can get a color wheel at an art supply store, which will guide you in
mixing colors.

I found a neat thing.  It\'s called "Color Tag."  It is an iron on
material (comes with a tiny, low temp iron) available in many
pantone colors.  Print your detail on the laser printer, and iron on
the color tag, wherever you have black it colors.  Make, say a
sunburst (i did :-)) but _negative_.  The colortag will color the
paper and leave a colored area where there was white on the mylar
sheet it comes on.

The result is a sheet of little decals minus the adhesive.  Then dull
coat it on.  Looks really, really good.  Works for all kinds of
stuff.  I scanned the insignia from the MT Rebellion book and
reduced them to put on all my 1:5000 traveller minis (my own, BTW).

I was at the range once... maybe 30 people sighting in hunting
rifles... bang.  bang, bang.  bang, bang, bang, BOOOOOM!  everyone
looks right.  The last guy on the right had a bolt action .50 cal.
Wow.  He shoots it in competition at absurdly long ranges (1000+
yards).  Those rounds went *deep* into the berm.

Oop.  I didn\'t mean to wander into a flame topic.  :(

Huh.  So, Star Trek, Star Wars, etc. have been right in making 
what I consider to be boring-looking ships, but wrong in using white 
instead of black.

Heh.  Well, I like the look of the dark metallic iron color from Armory, 
with details painted in dark versions of other colors.  It may not be 
realistic, but it does look pleasing.

But, if black is the way to go...

I just despair that there will then be no fun involved in paiting them.  
Get a can of black spraypaint and mass-paint \'em. [sigh]

Camouflage sounds fun.  Kind of strange to think of something in space 
being camouflaged.  I thought ships typically detected eachother at 
ranges too far for the naked eye to be of use.  Or is that a misconception?

I\'ve used dry-brushing with fantasy figures (cloaks, faces, etc.), but 
hadn\'t thought highlighting would be useful for ships.  Thanks for 
letting me know!

I think I still have my (home-made) color wheel around somewhere...

Thanks for all the tips on how these things are generally done.  And, 
again, I apologize for staring a topic that is prone to flames.  I didn\'t 
want that...

I\'m reminded of the situation 20 years ago. The comic stores had to get
comics from whoever had the "lock" on magazine distribution for the
area. And those distributors were geared for supplying things to
grocery stores, variety stores, etc. Which meant that you told them
which titles you wanted and "about" how many you wanted. They\'d make
thier order based *loosely* on what their customers numbers were, and
then they\'d divvy up the shipment they got *proportionally*. So a comic
shop would order 100 copies and might get 50 or 200. This is not
terribly workable for subscriptions. :-)

And, since they were afraid that the comic shops would sell comics,
then take them back "in trade", then return them as "unsold" for the
refund, they wouldn\'t let comic stores return unsold stock! Which,
combined with the inability to get the exact number they\'d ordered made
finances a *real* problem. (Can you tell that I used to help out at a
comic shop back then? :-)

Eventually, this led to the comic stores ordering from out of state
outfits, in spite of the higher charges, and the rise of new
distributors geared to the comic market.

If such did occur. GW would find themselves facing an anti-trust suit
rather quickly. You aren\'t allowed to "lock" the market that way. 

> The implications for Small Local Game Stores are frightening.

We could wind up with "chain" game stores, but the small local store
would still have to be able to exist. Because restricting the
availability of games to them can only be done in limited ways without
running into legal problems. And trust me, *somebody* being squeezed
out would find a lawyer willing to take the case on contingency...

That\'s why Bay News thought they could get away with screwing the comic
stores. Between being a small part of their customer base, and Bay
being "the only game in town", they figured they didn\'t have to care.
They found out differently when someone got the money to start a local
distribution company for comics and related stuff.

Point.  But if your view of the world is taken from the D&D manual?  I\'ve had
kids tell me that the ancient Greek myths were wrong, citing their D&D monter
manuals as \'proof\'.  I had one kid tell me that Wizards of teh Coast was
responsible for \'certifying\' new games, and that nothing could be an official
role playing game (like Magic) until WotC approved it!

In Toronto, Mike Cheney at Sci-Fi World gives away single figures at the
painting workshops he runs.  Always struck me as being an excellent idea:
give a customer a figure, teach him/her how to paint it so it looks nice, and
they\'ll be back for more figures (and paints and brushes).

Uh, yeah.  You know, given that IG has had my money since June, it would be

flamewar topic, just a "done to death" topic (James Dempsey, are you
listening? :-).  So don\'t worry about it.  The major points of view are as
follows:

1.  Military ships would be matt black to be camouflaged against space.
Civilian ships can be painted pretty much any color.

2.  All ships have cameleon skins according to the SOM, so paint them any
way you want.  Colorful military ships can be assumed to be in "parade
mode".  They turn black while on missions. 

I tend to favor the second approach, since it allows more artistic
freedom.

Point.  But if your view of the world is taken from the D&D manual?  I\'ve had
kids tell me that the ancient Greek myths were wrong, citing their D&D monter
manuals as \'proof\'.  I had one kid tell me that Wizards of teh Coast was
responsible for \'certifying\' new games, and that nothing could be an official
role playing game (like Magic) until WotC approved it!

This is scary!  It means that we need to teach more people to play Traveller 
before the masses pass into stupidity.

	Well, Joe, since I haven\'t painted a miniature in a dogs age, I 
can\'t much help, but some of the TNE books have color schemes in 
them, and, well, garish is the way to go from their examples. Since 
my books are three miles away, I disremember which ones have the 
color illos; \'Personalities of the Reform Coalition\' perhaps.  (I only 
paid $2.50 for it used, and so don\'t feel too ripped off, but it\'s 
certainly not a book I\'d pay full cover for.)

  Ted\'s a great guy. He started out in business selling Comics and CCGs.
Steve introduced him to gaming(tm) and opened his eyes to the potential
profit in rpg\'s and wargaming. I think Ted\'s heard a few things about
previous employers from customers as well. ;)

Now before I give you the URL there\'s a few things I\'d like to point out. 
 Aw screw it here\'s the URL and then all babble on:

1)  A couple of these links go nowhere, it\'s that under construction

2)  I haven\'t included any UPP data or maps yet and I\'m wondering if 
they\'re really going to be missed.  Mind you that is pretty simple nuts

3)  I didn\'t make the art work, that\'s all Chris Cox\'s work.  You can 
find his site and more of his magnificent art work here:

And, it is important to keep in mind that camoflage is more than just being 
invisible to the eye.  The comment was made on this subjest that other 
scanners would just negate the effects of any camo painting anyway, but in 
thinking about the "stealth technology" (actually a host of technologies 
used togather to make the ship hard to spot by any type of sensor) I think 
camo is important to traveller.  Maybe traveller doesn\'t use cloaking per 
se, but interesting camoflage patterns would be really neat.  First of all, 
it wouldn\'t have to just be plain black.  Nebulae are huge, colorful objects 
in space that cover entire clusters of stars within their boundaries.  Any 
ship that frequents a nebula could be quite colorful.  Any ship that often 
visits planetoid belts or gas giants could be camo-ed 
appropriately as well.  Any ship that wants to loudly proclaim its 
neutrality and/or allegance should be clearly marked.
	
To me it is most important to paint it in a way that you like.  Just because 
the list agrees that a scheme that you think is boring is the most likely 
doesn\'t mean you should use that scheme.  With a little imagination, you can 
justify any colors you want.  That\'s always been one of the nicer things 
about traveller-  they give you a game system and let you use your 
imagination to create the universe to game in (besides giving some very 
broad ideas about the empire, rebellion etc.)

It\'s funny how different people have such different perceptions. Most of my 
gaming group laugh at third Imperium Trav ship pictures - all the grace of shoe 
boxes :) Star Wars, ah now that gets them all going...

Having said that they feel the same way about Trav\'s high tech bolt action

What can you do?

I agree.  Look at it this way... if you are close enough to a florescent
pink battleship to actually SEE it, you\'re probably too close  :-)  Colour
schemes would probably be designed more for the benefit of the crew\'s
morale than that of the enemy (kinda like writing "Hello Hussein!" on a
missile and launching it towards Bagdad... who\'s gonna see?).

You just can\'t get the visually pleasing detail you want when using flat
("iron ball") black paint on a small miniature (who wants to squint?).
Sure, the F117A looks aggressive... but only in the daytime.  Look at it at
night and the novelty of its visual stealth technology quickly becomes
boring to the eye.

I can see it now... two fleets converging with angry slogans and nasty
artwork adorning the outsides of their vessels... faxing each other photos
of their ships in an attempt to intimidate the other side  :-)

Why?  At the ranges they\'re fighting at, visual detection doesn\'t count. 
Better to worry about your infra-red signature, neutrino emissions, and radar

No, not a misconception.  If the ship is purely a space fighter, such as the
Gazelle, use whatever colours you like.  If it might get involved in
atmospheric combat (eg. SDB) or be sitting on the ground (eg. Merc Cruiser)
then use appropriate cammo.  (I plan on doing my merc cruiser in desert
cammo, as soon as I build a stronger mount - that sucker\'s too heavy for the
plastic mount it came with!)

How \'bout the stubborn, hairless-apelike, two-legged kind who are (1) armed with the 
local brand of Real Big Game Rifle; (2) Know the ground like the back of their gnarled 
hands; and (3) Objects strongly to the presence of _Thems im-PER-eel boys_ coming to

redheads<g>, rare animal pelts) and how the indig inbreeds stand in the way of Progress,

Except perhaps for WotC and other companies that make the leap to the legendary \'mass

multiplicity of channels to the various segments of the mass market.

        Any chance of sharing some photos with us? I remember you talking
way back when about creating your own minis. Sounds interesting.

        Not boring at all. Invisible. There\'ve been reports of people
winding up with head and face injuries from walking into it because they
just couldn\'t see it clearly or judge distance.

        A big thing for camouflage is actually a very "busy" pattern. I.e.
instead of a few large blocks change the color frequently -- look a Marine
Recon tiger stripe. It doesn\'t alway even have to be "subdued" colors. I
remember an article by G. Harry Stine, talking about a guy who painted a
homebuilt airplane with a hodgepodge of garish colors, and kept getting
"nearmissed" in the pattern. Other pilots\' eyes just missed him. I\'ve done
the same thing with a model rocket. Never have found it.

        Something Anne McAffrey used in one of her novels was a pattern of
highly reflective (silver) and highly absorbtive (black) patches. Not only
does it confuse the eye, it could also cause confusion for sensors -- it\'s
harder (especially for dumb computers) to pick out details and understand
what they\'re seeing.

Perfect example.  The investment is probably 50 cents plus some of the 
owner\'s time.  And the return on that investment could be anywhere from 
20 bucks a month to . . . as much as I\'m embarrassed to say I spend on my 
hobbies. :)

He said he will try Traveller at his location, and if it sells well

Paradise locations about the game.

Here\'s hoping . . .

        FWIW, it was available in Montreal at Valet d\'Coeur as of Monday at
3:00 PM.  TML regular Ross Coburn did me a major favour and picked up a
copy for me, dropping it off at my place within two hours of it having hit
the shelf (many thanks, dude).  As a complete Traveller Newbie (previous
exposure was the TML and the MT SOM) whose previous RPG experience consists
of getting thoroughly disgusted with AD&D in High School and playing a lot
of Vampire the Masquerade, my impressions are as follows:

Art: Some of the Foss stuff is amazing.  The B&W stuff was so-so to blah.
I didn\'t like the starship & equipment drawings and would have greatly
preferred pseudo-technical side-front-top elevation blueprint-type
illustrations.  A lot of the illustrations just didn\'t look terribly "Far
Future", especially the ones involving that Crocodile Dundee lookalike.

Format: Typesetting was pretty blah.  Using sans serif fonts for text is
against my religion.  OTOH, the various topic headings are easy to spot and
separate just by skimming...

Content: Did a goodish job of covering what I understand to be the basics.
As for systems, I lack the experience to comment.

        All in all I\'m not disappointed after having skimmed through it
twice.  I thought that the MT SOM looked prettier, at least in terms of B&W
art and layout, and I think that the skill list is military-heavy, but
other than that I don\'t regret buying it and can\'t wait until I can use it.
Second session of our campaign is Monday next, so I\'ll be better able to
judge then

Yes, in RCEG you have options for Vacuum capable Battledress.  It even 
includes it\'s duration.

I don\'t think there\'s anything specific.  Look in FF&S.

HEV can be used in a vacuum, combat armor, depends greatly upon the type. 
 I wouldn\'t want to wear chain mail in a vaccum, a Combat 
Environmental Suit I would.

I\'d never noticed the Vac belt.  Don\'t know...

Ya, and they never will be either...  I guess that means we can look at 
old Trav stuff and make up our own rules.

If anyone from IG is reading this list, I\'d love to know exactly what
niche T4 is aimed for: West End\'s *Star Wars* (in second edition now,
yet!) would seem to have the Space Opera genre sewn up, though with
Shatterzone in fairly hot pursuit.  *Warhammer 40K*, *Renegade Legion*,
*Mekton Z*, etc. have the spiky-bits killer-mech hand-waving it\'s-cool
angle well-covered.  Holistic Design\'s new *Fading Suns* might even lure
a few of the *Vampire* crowd into SFRPG\'s.  But did *2300AD* spook
everyone away from the hard-science genre?  (I note that even SJG, of
the GURPS sourcebook for everyone, have largely neglected Space settings,
aside from the low-high-tech *Terradyne* and the even-more-niche
*Lensman*).  What sort of person is IG gambling on as a first-time buyer
of their product over any other company\'s?  We have too little advertising

I hate to write in my books, so I came up with an alternate plan for 
making the errata corections to T4.   I think perhaps others might 
find my method to be of use.

I grabbed the errata from IG\'s web site, then imported the stuff into 
my word processor.  I then pulled up one of the Avery label formats (in 
this case, all I had at hand were the Diskette labels, but any large 
labels will do) and put the Jump Drive Potential Table on one label, the 
Rank/Rolls table on another, and the corrected ranges for the Sandcasters 
Table on a third.  I formatted them to be as close to the T4 type font as 
possible, then printed them out.  

It took a little cutting, but I got them to fit into the T4 book pretty 
well. I put the Benefits Rolls table next to the Draft Table on page 26.  
The Jump Drive Potential Table fits well on the bottom of page 104, which 
is the page just before the QSDS tables start.  Of course, the revised 
Sandcasters Table went right over the one on page 120.

This gives me a copy of T4 that is without serious error.  More 
importantly, it is a copy of T4 I can refer to without having the errata 
sheet nearby.

I hope you\'re able to find this of use.

Just want to add my two cents to this thread. This may be off topic, but it
could be standard practice for ships to be painted some colour in
Traveller. In space, thousands of micro-meteorites pound into the ships
hull every miniute creating some damage to the hull. The paint maybe a way
of maintaining the "good looks" of the ship by absorbing some of the
impact, something like ablative armour? Sure, this would soon become
patchy, but when it comes to the annual refit, the hull can be repaired,
and paint scheme redone, or a new one put on. I realise I\'ve gone from
minitures to the real this but if you can justify it in a "real" world
scale, then its easy to apply to the smaller scale.

Just some thoughts...

2. Fill in some dots, viz:

    On the 4, two dots opposite each other, making a 2.

    On the 5, two dots opposite each other, making a 3.

    On the 6, all of \'em. Then make a small dint in the middle of that face, and
dot some "dot colour" paint into the dint.

That\'s it. Yeah, I know, the dots don\'t follow the strict rules of sides adding
up. But I\'ve been using two of these for That Other Game for about ten years now
and they work fine, fine, fine.

        I did something similar with the FF&S errata and upgrade ... printed
them out, cut each correction out separately, and then taped one side on the
appropriate place. That way, I can still flip up the correction to see
what\'s under it (especially if the correction is bigger than the original text).

>A few questions reguarding TNE Vacc Suits, Combat Armour and Battle Dress
>Can battle dress with life support be used in a vacume (space)?

        Combat Armor and battle dress are sealed, so yes, they can be used
in space. LS is built into battle dress (short-duration).

>How do you design Vacc suits in TNE?

        You can\'t, really. There\'s not much variation, so you just pick them
out of the equipment list. The only thing that would be worth even thinking
about, IMO, would be the life support packs.

>To what minimum pressures are Hostile Env Suits and combat armour useable?

        Hostile Environment Suits _are_ vacc suits, built to withstand more
hostile environments (corrosive atmospheres, etc.), so they can be used down
to zero pressure.

        Combat _armor_ is fully sealed, so it is good down to zero pressure.
A combat _environment suit_ is not.

>Can a Vacume belt (TNEp337) be used to augmet these?

        Not needed. A vacuum belt is intended to provide additional support
for your body when wearing a body pressure suit below 0.43 atm (Thin). The
suit itself is sealed, which a combat environment suit isn\'t. Battle dress,
hostile environment suits and combat armor have this support built in.

>The various rules RCES, FFS, and TNE are not clear on these points.

        Some of it was apparently assumed from previous versions of Traveller.

Boring to the EYE, but not the BRAIN  :-)

True, the non-reflective nature of the skin of the F117A is remarkable and
mind boggling, but it doesn\'t "catch the eye".  If you want realism, go for
black... if you want a miniature that draws attention to it and looks
attractive to the eye, there are better colours to choose from.  This is
the main selling feature of anything from Games Workshop... brightly
coloured miniatures with rediculous banners for those slogans I mentioned.

When you spend a few hours finishing & painting your miniatures, you want
something that actually looks like you spent "a few hours finishing &
painting them"... and these means lots of detail.  It is just hard getting
a black miniature to look detailed due to the fact that they are so small
to begin with.  Extra colours (used tastefully, of course) add to that
detail.

When I play table-top, I try to insist on painted miniatures (that is,
after all, what miniature gaming is all about... at least as much detail as
a coloured cardboard counter would be if those were used instead).  An
unpainted miniature can be just as difficult to identify (as to its type)
as a flat black miniature from across the table and this can lead to all
sorts of wasted time moving around the gaming table to see exactly *what*
your opponent is fielding.

Here\'s my advice.  When painting a miniature that is supposed to be black,
use dark grey instead and save the black for detailing.  That way, at least
the black detailing will stand out (for those few areas that absolutely
*must* be painted black).

Or take a Toblerone, mark all three long sides, and pitch it across the

Visual sensors will only be useful under *powerful* zoom, and this means a
*very* narrow field of vision.  To acquire a visual lock on a ship at these
distances would either be pure luck or require the use of other sensors to
acquire the target first (meaning that the ship already has a better way of
tracking the target than "visually").

Personally, I like the idea of painting "This Optical Sensor Out of Order"
in big letters on the side of a ship.  Maybe the enemy will think it\'s a
sensor glitch and fire at somebody else.  Or maybe really cool (or naughty)
artwork so that the enemy becomes mesmurized and pauses....  :-)

> What color should you paint the 0.1c rock?

I believe it should be painted slightly blue due to the blue-shift of an
object moving towards you (red if moving away)  :-)

HUGE SELF PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN FOLLOWS
************************************

"The Long Way Home" is a 96 page campaign adventure containing 8 superb
scenarios with full colour cover, deck plans for a new design of Scout Ship,
details of over 50 worlds (adventure worlds include system maps, world maps,
etc.), maps for all the major adventure settings, and a few pictures
squeezed in...

It\'s due to be published by BITS (British Isles Traveller Support) in about
2 days time for release at Euro GEN CON. It will also be published by Sword
of the Knight in the US in the very near future.

Hang on to your hats - the first licensed Milieu 0 adventure...

==============
...IS HERE!!!!
==============

Distribution should be through normal channels in the US, and through mail
order and at BITS events in the UK, i.e. we hope to be selling copies at
Euro GEN CON in a few days time.

I will send more details (e.g. ordering info) to the list as they become
available.

This is just the first in a line of products brought to you by the CORE(tm)
Traveller products team.

We\'ve discussed the problems of trying to hunt with one of them
("Honest officer, it\'s a hunting rifle!" :-). With normal "ball" ammo,
they\'ll punch a hole clear through just about any land animal, doing
minimal damage. But the thought of a .50 cal hollowpoint round is a bit
scary. (especially when someone get\'s this thoughtful look and starts
muttering things like "fill with C4, add a recessed primer as a
detonator, yeah!") 

They do tend to get noticed. But I\'m told that a friend of a friend
gets *really* noticed when he digs out his 4 pounder cannon!

Actually, most ships that don\'t have a *good* reason to be painted some
other way will be a "light" color overall, with the radiator panels
being black. This is due to heat loading considerations. Sunlight at 1
AU is several kW/m^2 of heat. Since ships already have problems getting
rid of heat, you paint them a color that tends not to absorb it. 

Likewise, you paint the radiators as black as you can, as that helps
radiate heat. 

You want all the radiators placed so that the ship is *easily* oriented
with them facing *away* from the sun. If you ever need to absorb heat,
just orient the ship with them towards the sun.

And of course, if you get close, you\'ll see details like emergency
access hatches picked out in distinctive colors, and various labels and
warnings ("Not a Step", "Warning: cryogenic temps likely", etc). On
miniatures, I\'d try to suggest such by placing *very* fine broken lines
in appropriate areas (the idea is that the "pieces" of the line are
individual words).

Remember that manuevering in space tends to require many *hours* of
fuel. "Car" type vehicles only require a few at most. Add in the
requirements for life support, acceleration compensation, and weapons,
and you may discover that either you have a "fighter" with only a
couple turns of endurance, or that you can\'t get the acceleration you
want because of all the fuel required.

Hate to tell you this, but those brightly colored nebula you see in the
books are in the same league as the "neon color" pictures of Jupiter.
That is, the color has been *very* enhanced. The sort of nebula you see
in Star Trek just plain doesn\'t exist. 

Real nebulas are a harder vacuum than you\'ll find in a light bulb. The
colors are the result of *long* exposures, and the results are the
summing of all the light generated by the gases over a path *light
years* long.

Sitting in the middle of a "dense" and "bright" nebula, you\'d notice
that you had trouble seeing things more than a few *thousand* AU off,
due to the slight fuzziness caused by the gases. It\'d take special
instruments to detect the glow. 

Asteroid and planetoid belts aren\'t like on TV or in the movies either.
Remember, we\'ve sent at least 5 or six probes thru the asteriod belt,
and we had to aim them carefully to get them close enough to take a
picture of an asteroid. An asteriod may be miles across, but it\'s a
*lot* of thousands of niles from the next one.

Except *nobody* should have a "15G speeder". 

Folks are confusing areodynamic *manuevering* acceleration with
straight-line acceleration. 

In a fluid medium like air, a craft capable of less than *2* gees
sustained acceleration can use the reaction between airfoils and the
fluid to make turns that impose 15 gees on passengers. But that\'s a
quite different situation than being able to accelerate at 15 gees.
Even in bursts.

You rate an atmospheric craft by thrust, and figure its thrust to
weight ratio, and figure the drag coefficient. And the situation is
much the same for a land or water vehicle. 

Drag sets a very definite speed limit, and acceleration drops off
*rapidly* as velocity increases. 

To look at it another way, I don\'t care *how* much power you have,
exceeding mach one in the city limits *is* going to get your license
pulled. Especially near the ground.

Most folks don\'t realize it, but close up the shock cones that
constitute "sonic booms" are *incredibly* damaging. The US Air Force
Academy in Colorado had to delay opening some buildings when they
started up because *one* pilot in a T-34 trainer had done a low level
supersonic pass over the campus. It didn\'t just break windows. It did
several million dollars worth of *structural damage* to the buildings
(we are talking about things like warping steel girders!)

So Junior is not going to be going supersonic except out in the sticks.
And even there, he\'s liable to get ticketed if he does it to close to
anything that can be damaged. 

Thus, the market for supersonic personal vehicles will be limited to
the folks who operate them out of "airport" type facilities. 

BTW, for an interesting take on the way a cultural much like America
might go if very high speed vehicles *were* common, try to track down
the stories Rick Raphael wrote about the Transcontinental Thruway
Police back in the 60\'s. They appeared in Analog (even got the cover a
couple of times) and were collected in a book titled "Code Three" (I\'ve
seen exactly *two* copies. One belonged to a friend who bought it new.
The other took a book hunter a couple of years to track down for me.

Anyway, we have "cars" shift to ground effect at high speeds and cruise
at 500 mph... If nothing else, it\'ll give you some ideas on how to
handle a society that is a logical outgrowth of a trend, but quite
different from what the players might expect.

Very good. Get rid of grav thrust drops of to 10% after a few dims and use
gravthrust equals design gravthrust times local gravity. With this a 100
ton mass vehicle will always need 100 ton gravthrust or more to
float/levitate, no matter the local grav. I\'ve used this in my campaign for
close to 5 years and it makes for interesting spacefights when gravthrusted
lowtech fighters zip close to planet surfaces to get extra thrust. Also,
hitech gravthruster missiles are really dangerous because they\'re pretty
hard to see without thrustflames et c.

Oh?  I\'m certain the people in competition with Microsoft will be happy to
hear this.

It may be technically illegal, but if you can drive your competition out of
business (eg. NCR) or if the increased profits are more than the fine (eg.
Microsoft) then it makes "sound business sense" to do it.

Though I\'m still not keen on the return to Grav-plates I\'ve got a few 
questions reguarding their use.

1)  In order to funtion corretly they need a gravity well of some kind to 
"push off" of, Right?

2)  The weaker the gravity well, ie the further out in a system you are, 
the less effective these thrusters are, correct?

3)  What\'s the theoretical cut off point for Grav-Plates?  ie.  Where do 
they crap out?  100 diameters?  1000 diameters?  And I\'m assuming we\'re 
talking planetary diameters here not stellar diameteres.

4)  If a ship some how wound up in an asteroid field, very small bodies 
of rock, eg. the Kininur, how would a rescue team get in?  You\'d think 
all these very small gravity feilds would play hell upon the Grav-plates 
mechanisms.

5)  Does the momentum you\'ve accumulated using grav thrusters stick with 
you when the thrusters crap out?  ie. If you\'re travelling at 100 kps (I 
always do math with round numbers) heading away from a planet, you pass 
point "y" at which the Grav-Plates ceace to function correctly, do you 
maintatain your current vector you do you just sort of slow down and 
stop?

6)  If a ship miss-jumps into deep space, you\'re stuck right?  Assuming 
you don\'t have the fuel to get back into J-Space, you\'re doomed to spend 
an eternity floating about the void without any propulsion to at least 
point you in the right direction.

1.	FIRST REALLY GOOD GAME STORE

2.	PAINTING

Joe, I use the chrome from the _Starship Operator\'s Manual_, that the 
ship has a "chameleon circuit". Then it\'s easy to justify bright colour 
schemes, because you say, "When you get into combat, you simply switch to 
black". Paint one miniature black and the other in your colur scheme of 
choice (didn\'t you buy up all of RAFM\'s stock?? No wonder I can\'t get 
any!?! ;-).

Think of it as the difference between the brightly-painted "sales model" 
F-16 (White, red, etc) vs the dull grey version with low-res national 
markings, and you\'ll get the drift.

Camo is to disguise ships _on the ground_ (although black, in space, _is_ 
camo). Again, another use for the chameleon circuit. No wonder hulls cost 
so much!

Why is this topic "prone to flames"? It should just be about "here\'s a 
good technique to use", not "you must paint ALL Imp Marine units in maroon".

My experience with miniature painting suggests that those small details are

Also, you might get some good effects by mixing flat black with gloss details.

   I was struck by how much it resembled a Klingon warrior with a

To be certain, though, it is a different rendering than the previous

        ContraGravity used by grav vehicles is something entirely different
than thrust plates used by spacecraft. ContraGravity depends on the local
gravity, and goes down very quickly. The way we orginally discussed it,
thrust is directly proportional to the local gravity field, with an upper
limit so once you get to about 1.5 or so gravities, the thrust doesn\'t go up
regardless.

        Thruster plates work out to several thousand AU basically
unaffected, at which point some quantum tetrionic mumble mumble mumble
effect sets in, and thrust drops by a factor of a hundred or so.

A college buddy of mine(and fellow Traveller player) made a 2-pounder cannon out of a 
piece of steel stock that he bored out on a lathe. He fired lead balls the size 
(roughly, it\'s been almost 20 years since then) of a baseball out of a 24\'\' barrel 
mounted to a naval-style carriage (small wheels as opposed to the classic "Napoleonic" 
style carriage) with trunnions. 

When charged with 2-3 shot glasses full of black powder, it would could drive that lead 
ball hard enough to wreck the engine of a (junk) car or punch a very big hole in 
someone/thing.

We took this cannon to a range one day, and it _really_ got the instant respect of all 
the camou-cald AR-15/AK totin\' crowd (this was before the Ban on "assault weapons"). 
These guys stopped shooting as a pair of college students laid this gun on the junked 
car we were all shooting at and perforated the target like it was a tin can.

We even fired grapeshot out of it at a wooden silhouette target and blew it to 
splinters.

In other words, We had FUN! Good, clean FUN!

Well, I suppose as the TL gets up there, one could create weird

You\'re partly right.

That is, you\'re right about the physics, but it\'s a part of physics that
Traveller ignores.  If you look at the actual power consumed on a starship,
which will end up as heat, you find many starships should be glowing a nice
cherry-red colour!  And then there\'s the robots emitting several kilowatts of
heat.

Passenger: "Steward, warm my coffee please."
Robot Steward: "My pleasure, sir." - sticks finger in coffee.

Anyway, for the sake of the game (and because I\'m too lazy to rewrite FF&S,
or MT) I\'ll ignore the laws of thermodynamics in ship design.  And I\'ll paint
my ships to be eye-catching.

Having said that, most of my ships _are_ light-coloured, so that they stand
out against the black playing surface.  If I\'m going to spend hours painting
a ship, I want it to be seen!

I spoke to Ken Whitman of Imperium Games today, and he said that they 
expect the hardcovers to arrive in time to get them in the mail to us 
by the end of next week (allowing time for Marc to sign them).  After 
that, it\'ll be up to the postal service as to how much longer we have to 
wait.

When I talked to a guy at Games Unique at a north Dallas shopping mall last 
month, he emphatically denied the existance of T4 (said GDW was going under).  
I placed my name on a waiting list anyway, and when I picked my copy up on the 
22nd, he acted as though he was on top of all the latest news about T4 
(quoting all the things I said previously back to me).  

Anyway, they only got two copies, allegedly shipped without cellophane or 
plastic covers.  The copies were covered with greasy fingerprints as were the 
interior art.  Is this consistant with everyone your experience?  Or was he 
lying about the cellophane cover?  I personally like for my fingerprints to be 
the first ones on stuff I purchase (I otherwise rag-out my gaming materials).

BTW: I got both copies...(nyaah, nyaah)   <grin>

I\'ve been gone/busy for a while (thesis deadlines, a conference in
Seattle, blah, blah, ...) so have only been reading, and that
occasionally.  600+ messages after a week away!  

I got a paperback T4 yesterday; got tired of waiting for the hardbound
and besides (as I told my wife), it\'ll be handy to have a spare.  I told
the owner of the local hobby shop/game store/wedding decorations
showroom (it\'s a mother-and-son venture) about it a couple of weeks ago,
and he ordered exactly 1 copy.  The first thing I noticed was a page
which had been folded when cut at the printer and so had about 1/4 inch
of \'flash\' hanging out of the cover.  Hopefully this isn\'t indicative of
the printers QA efforts.  However, since I wanted the book (he offered
to re-order with a 2-week wait), I wanted to encourage him carrying it,
and he offers a 20% discount on all \'adventure\' games, I got it.  That
plus 4 D3\'s (numbers instead of pips, but only one was red on black)
cost about $24 :)  Next step is hypeing it to my game gang.

First impressions (more or less in order):

+  The cover looks sharp, and the type is easy to read.

- -  The binding doesn\'t lie open easily; hopefully it\'ll break in
without     breaking down.

- -  I made a point of looking for the weapons pictures and, yeah,
they      suck rocks.  My wife, who\'s something of an artist, wasn\'t so
kind ;)

+  The color pictures are really cool!

?  The B&W pictures are ok.

?  The pictures in general are scattered through the book with
little      relation to anything else.  Maybe if the bw\'s were related
to the       adventures and the colors were at chapter breaks?  Oh well,
too late    now.

- -  The editing leaves more than a little to be desired.  How a
\'junp       drive\' got through a spell checker is beyond me.  I hereby
volunteer    to assist with proofreading of future work (seriously, IG,
e-mail       me!).  I\'m afraid this is a bit of a pet peeve for me;
in-line typos    and grammer errors tend to derail my train of thought.

+- QSDS is in there (+), but they butchered the organization (-)

?  The task system, IMHO, weighs characteristics too heavily compared
to    skills.  I\'m considering dividing characteristics in half
and           subtracting 1D from each task difficulty level.  Comments?

?  I don\'t know MT or TNE, but I thought AHL/Striker was a
big             improvement over CT in terms of weapon pen vs armor. 
I\'m not           terribly impressed by the combat system on first
glance.  Guess I\'ll    have to play test that a little.

The overall quality seems to be quite good.  I _do_ wish they had
another week or two to do the job as well as they appear to be able to.
Hopefully next time.

Gotta go.

It sounds right.  Mine looked a bit the worse for wear, and had just
come in that morning (yesterday)!  Moderately abused corners and misc.
smudges on front, plus a mis-cut page.  I guess they went for a lower
bid on the printing to keep the price down.  I figure that it\'ll make
little difference after a year or two of wear.  Hopefully, the hardbacks
will get a little more TLC.

Yep, I got the only one, and the same day it came in.  Hopefully he\'ll
take the hint.  Gotta get back and start bugging him about JTAS.  Does
anyone know if IG\'s distributing that through retailers?

Hmm.  I really don\'t know.  

email imperiumgames@imperiumgames.com and ask \'em. :)

And please post the response here, in case anyone else might want to buy a 
hardcover. :)

Hmmm.  I don\'t know how T4 is being shipped, but I do know that every 
copy I\'ve purchased (four softcover copies so far!) has been in prime 
condition.  No fingerprints, smudges, etc.  (In fact, my FLGS keeps one 
bagged copy of each game where people can see it, and the rest of the 
stock is kept in drawers so that they stay in perfect condition.  When 
you ask for a copy of a game, they deliver it to you by holding it on 
their fingertips, like a waiter carries a tray!)

> BTW: I got both copies...(nyaah, nyaah)   <grin>

Ut oh. Another one is on the road to owning too many copies of T4, like 
me. :)  (Once I get my two hardbacks, I\'ll have six copies...if I don\'t 
come up with an excuse to buy more in the meantime[G].  Yes, it\'s an 
illness.)

     Amazing - I picked up my softcover from Logical Choice, Canberra, 
     _Australia_ yesterday. A very rare occurrence. We must have got it 
     from the first shipping or something like that.
     
     First impressions are that it is really visually appealing. What I 
     would love to see though is a story behind the Foss colour plates. I 
     liked the storylines that went with the black and white prints too.

	As known Stephanon had a lot of women (he even prefered to

	If forced to make shure that she realy is an Alea Alk, she will
	tell that most was lost by the last 100 years of war. I fact
	the only "truth" she has are some handscribles and voicedictates
	from stephanon in Mueckes synaptical memories. And a false holo

The editing bugs me as well.  

As for proofreading for IG, I do know that they are soliciting 
corrections.  If you want to go through the book and note every 
correction, then send your corrections to IG, I\'m sure they\'d appreciate 
it every much.  Someday, there will be a second printing, and they will 
need to know where the errors are. 

If you decide to do this, you might format your message like this:

Page 137, Line 1:  "Through them, PCs with NPCs, events, animals . . ."
Should Read: "Through them, PCs will have experiences with NPCs, events, 
animals . . ."

Or,

Page 137, Line 1: "Through them, PCs [will have experiences] with NPCs, 
events, animals . . ."


Send comments to imperiumgames@imperiumgames.com.  They are actively 
soliciting errata.  Check out their web page 
(http://www.imperiumgames.com) to see the latest errata sheet.

I\'m having some difficulty adjusting to it, too.  But, I figure 
the T4 core rules are supposed to be simple enough to attract new 
gamers, so that explains why it\'s not like AHL or Striker.  Marc Miller 
has said he wants to have supplements of increasing complexity produced 
for each major subject.  Maybe there\'s an advanced combat system planned 
for release next year?

I\'m personally looking forward to an advanced trade system.  Maybe in 
\'97?  [please, IG, please!:)]

So THANK YOU all!

Now to answer a few questions...

1) Hardbacks are due here Tuesday the 3rd.  If all goes right some of you
will be gitting yours as early as Saterday.

2) Chessex Distributors sales .5 D6 ask you store owner, he may already
have some.

3) We ship from the WEST COAST.  Our distributors are ordering
conservatively, which causes the retailers to only get a few at at time.
However, when a retailer tells you its out of stock, or his distributor
cant get it, all he is doing is trying to save face, Its hard for people to
say, "I dident think that this game would sale, but heck, what do I know!"

Keep up the good work on pestering the stores.  Every little bit helps.
Oh, and dont forget to play Traveller at your local shops, that really
helps to get new players, and if a store orners sees people playing, they
keep everthing in stock!

Your Friends at IG.

Or order some of the blank D6\'s that are available form one of the 
companies (i recall Zocchi or Flying Buffaloe, I\'ll check into it 
tomorrow) and stencil in 2-1\'s, 2-2\'s, 2-3\'s.  Then put on some clear

    'body' => 'Howdy,

I\'m a long time Trav player and fan from the early days...  I had been into
Traveller for about 6-8 months when I bought JTAS #1 from GDW at their
offices in Bloomington-Normal on Father\'s Day Weekend in 1979.  I\'ve been
on the list before but due to a job change (and loss of a free high-speed
net connection) I discontinued my sub for a couple of years.  With the
arrival of T4 I have resubscribed and have been lurking for the past week
or two.  I\'ve enjoyed all of your posts, especally the one that Joe Walsh
posted about the Game Shop in Waukegan.  I\'m planning a road trip from the
far west Chicago Suburbs to check that store out!  I hope that they have a
couple of things I\'m looking for (see bottom of message)...

Anyway,  I\'ve watched with increasing interest the posts on color schemes
for starship minatures.  I actually have not gotten around to painting my
Trav Mini\'s yet, but I\'ve painted a vast number of Star Fleet Battle (SFB)
minatures so I have some experience with the subject.

On the subject of the ships themselves remember the type of ship that it is
and what it is intended for.  In other words, Scout Ships will primarily be
in a scheme of the Scout Service, a patrol craft the scheme of it\'s service
(planetary or otherwise), a subsidized merchant or "liner" would be in the
scheme of the owning firm or subsidy provider, a yacht would reflect the
personality of it\'s owner, whereas with a Free or Far Trader it\'s a case of
"anything goes" etc...

Most of these ships are going to be subjected to adverse conditions.  From
ground to atmosphere to orbit to deep space to jump space to atmospheric
reentry, to gas giant refueling these ships lead a rough life.  I wouldn\'t
expect a shiny new ship to remain in mint shape for very long.  To borrow a
line from Star Wars: "You came on that thing?  You\'re braver than I
thought!"...  Many ships will have the signs of hasty repairs from
mishaps... combat and otherwise.  Not to say that every ship is going to
look like a flying junkyard, but, for every professional starship painting
facility there will be 5 "Earl Schiebs".

For inspiration as to paint jobs simply look to your nearest commerical
airport.  I\'m not saying that you should copy anyone\'s scheme but you can
pick similar styles for some of your ships.  Also take a close look at the
planes, they lead a tough life these days too.  Look for weathering details
that you can emulate with your mini\'s.

One can use the Chris Foss, Bill Keith, or other Traveller artists for
examples if you choose.  While I really like Chris Foss\'s work on T4, they
are great pictures, I have to admit that the type of ships CF has
illustrated is a marked departure from what I had considered Traveller
Ships to look like.  But then again I have 6 signed Bill Keith original oil
paintings on my bedroom wall too.  I realize that if times were reversed
and Foss did the early artwork and Keith was the newcomer we would probably
be having the same discussion too just with different names.  In a game
that is geared to the use of the imagination it\'s all a matter of
perspective.

Some thoughts on Camoflauge schemes...  As an experienced PaintBaller I can
tell you that the benefits from effective Camo come from proper
colorization (about 50%) and it\'s pattern (about 50%).  Half of the
objective of any Camo Scheme is to blend the object\'s colorization with
it\'s background and the other half is to disrupt object\'s shape to complete
the blending.  Consider the background the ship (or other object) wishes to
get lost in: Atmosphere, Desert, Forest, Urban, Ocean, Gas Giant or Deep
Space, etc...  A deep space pattern would have black but some deep grays
and some white specks as well.  A Desert pattern would look similar to the
US Desert Day camo, which would also blend well with similarly colored
terrain, planets, sea floors, etc.  An effective pattern will cause the eye
to skip over it.  Whereas a mono-tone Khaki wearing person on a sand dune
will look to the eye like a Khaki object in the shape of a man.
Interesting note...  The British call their camo uniforms DPM\'s for
"Disruptive Pattern Military"...   If you have ever seen a "Gillie Suit"
you know the heavy emphasis the British put on disguising the shape they
are trying to hide.

Another painting technique that I use quite frequently are "washes" with
water based colors.  What you do is paint your mini the main color you wish
all of the various parts to be: On a starship, the hull the color you want,
radiators a black the viewports a medium brown or green, the rocket
exhausts black or ashen gray, etc.  On a mini of a person all of the
features and clothing the colors you want, etc.  Then take a dab of black
(or other color such as tan or gray, etc) and dilute it to about 2 or 3
parts water and 1 part paint.  Then quickly spread this dilute mixture all
over the mini in broad strokes (you can use a larger brush for this), then
blow off any excess water.  What you end up with is a weathered effect
where the wash color settles in the details and gives the object a
realistic and detailed effect.  A black wash settles in crevaces and
emulates shadows, while a tan or gray emulates dust or sand.  You get the
idea...

Experiement with your ships.  You will get a better feel for what you like
as you go along.  Don\'t be afraid of painting over earlier work, after all
many ships will be repainted in the course of their lives.  Use as thin of
coats as possible in order to preserve as much detail as possible.

I have also found that if you do a good job painting your mini\'s and prime
them properly that they really don\'t need a gloss or flat clearcoat for
protection.  I have had a lot of SFB ships go through a lot of battles
without any discernable damage as long as they are not thrown around or
dropped onto hard surfaces.  If you take reasonable care of them they don\'t
need the extra coat.

Anyway, Sorry to ramble on so long about painting mini\'s, but I hope I have
posted something of use to someone.

BTW, I am in the market for the following items to complete my collection:

Challenge 63, 65 and 78 and up (Does anyone know when GDW ceased production
of Challenge?).  Traveller Chronnicles 1-4.  If anyone knows where I could
obtain these I would be most appreciative.

Cheers!

I like the style and I\'m not going to knock the artist.  I think as far

Hummmm... Just looked at that puppie again.  Let me do something of a 
step backwards from my original sumation.  I love the clothes and body, 
tiger stripes are a definate two thumbs up, makes him look cool...  Nice 
agressive if arogant stance, don\'t take any shit from the fleshy bald 
creatures.  These just one thing I don\'t like.

The face.  Ya, well...  Mister Worf, take us into jump space...  Ya, just 
too klingon, like the eyes though.  Always had a thing for eyes though.  
That girl on the cover of National Geographic, wooooooo...  Shudder down 
my spine man those were haunting eyes.

One thing to remember this is listed as a concept drawing and let me tell 
you if you\'d seen half the concept drawings I\'ve seen and seen what came 
out of it you wouldn\'t be worried.  Best source for concept drawings to 
see what I mean.  Ralph McQuires (?) art of StarWars...  Must be his 
drawings, you could base a hundred great adventures just on those 
pictures alone.

An admirable aim, Joe. Bear in mind, howver, that in attempting to

difficult to produce a completely error-free product.

Re: Painting Traveller Starship Miniatures

When the RAFM ships first came out (a few days before Origins, some
years ago) we were air-freighted a bunch of them. Frank handed a
couple of each to me and said "Paint these in time for the con...we\'re
running Brilliant Lances demos, y\'know." I had about 8 hours to do
it, counting drying time.

I used a Gull Grey base coat from a spray can, with a wash of sepia
oil paint to pop the details. I then drybrushed small details in a variety of colors, trying for
"visually interesting." Stir in some micro-decals from assorted
sources (1/144 scale aircraft, fantasy and historical shield decals,
etc) and the results were good enough to draw compliments from many of
the players in the Brilliant Lances demos at that summer\'s con
circuit.

Yes to both.  Thrusters work out to 2000-3000 AU (they get you to Uranus,
but not to Neptune.  Thrusters are expensive and are not available until
TL 11. 

Grav-plates (ie what is used on grav vehicles) are cheap, they don\'t take
much power, but they are reduced to 1% of their normal thrust at 10
Diameters (I\'m assuming stellar, planetary, or even asteroid diameters
here).  I\'m getting all these figures off of the QDS. design page (or is
it the SSDS design page, I\'ve forgotten).  Anyway, my take on this is
simply that the thrust of grav plates decreases by a factor of (distance
from the planet in diameters) squared (ie 1/25 thrust at 5 diameters...

See above, they\'re pretty poor past 5 diameters.  As I said above, it 
makes most sense if both stellar and planetary diameters work, though I\'d
not want to be in a ship 5 diameters from the sun.

Oh, I tried some quick back of the envelope calculations and found that
you could use a Grav vehicle capable of a 2 G thrust to go from Earth to
the Moon.  You accelaerate out from Earth to 8-10 diameters (ie when the
thrust is pretty minimal) you are no going *roughly* 16 kps, which is
above escape velocity and is fast enough to get to the Moon in 5 hours or
so (the journey to 10 diameters has taken a similar time). 

At this point you had better be aimed at the Moon or you are truly lost in
space.  If you are, then when you get to 10 diameters from the Moon you
turn your thrust back on and decelerate for all you\'re worth.  Total Earth
to Moon time will be around 10-15 hours (all very rough).  This will only
work for short journeys, since the travel time to Mars at absolute closest
approach is almost 2 months (ie much more time than I\'d want to spend in a
car). 

All in all, I *really* like these grav plates.  They allow executives to
take their 47th century BMW to the moon for a meeting, but they don\'t work
to well for actual starships.

That would be very tricky and thrusters would be a much better bet.

I assume velocity is velocity and so once you leave the gravity well and
the grav-plates are useless you keep cruising along.  Any other answer

If you misjump further than 3000 AU unless you drift within 10 diameters
of a comet or a moon you are definitely SOL unless you have a HEPLAR drive
too.

This posting, while no doubt well intentioned, is in error.  While I may

You are quite correct.  I reread the rules on using sensors in Combat
(p117).  Good catch and thanks,

So, even though I\'ve done as you said and bought 4 or more copies, the 
next print run could be just as bad?!?  Now you tell me!  Arrghh! :)

At work there are standards for just about everything, and the standard 
font is Ariel (which is pretty close to the fonts used for T4 and CT).  
Sooo....we\'re 30 years behind the times in our standards, eh?  Doesn\'t

What this comes from is that there has been research done (and I don\'t
remember by who--this info comes from a class I took called Publications
Layout & Design in college) that suggests that serif fonts are better to
use for text, while sans serif fonts should be used for titles, headings,
bulleted lists, etc. The theory is that the serifs (those tiny lines at the
bottom of letters on serif fonts--check out Times New Roman for an
example) help the reader to guide his / her eyes across the line of text.
They form sort of a "border" between one line and the next, and thus
should be used when there is a large block of text on the page. That\'s
why you\'ll see novels (and most other books), newspapers, and
magazines printed in some kind of serif font. 

I, for one, find it easier to read serif fonts, and was hoping IG would\'ve
taken some of the latest design research into account when typesetting
T4. Oh well. I\'m sure that most people don\'t notice it.

Remember, "lidar" is one of the sensors you are talking about. So the
lower the reflectance of the hull, the less chance of anyone getting a
usable return from your ship. It also reduces the reflected (and
emitted) light, making the ship harder to detect.

The big problem is IR. Reducing radiated IR is going to be a real
problem. Thankfully, IR is not suitable for a reflected beam sensor the
way microwaves and light are. 

Thus my suggested "stealth bubble" for ships. A large, opaque bubble of
a diameter such that the IR it re-radiates will be at too low a temp to
be effectively detected. This could easily require a bubble kilometers
across. So making it black is good insurance.

Actually, you can produce some *very* eye-catching ships by using real
physics. I forget who did it, but I recall a *lovely* design using
liquid drop radiators. You basicly "spray" out a stream of drops of
molten metal near the nose of the ship. The stream of drops spreads a
bit on the way to the collectors nears the stern. In this design, the
streams are running parallel to some "vanes", that help reflect the
heat into space. 

So you have this ship that looks rather like like a *very* stretched
out hunting broadhead, and with these streams drops that start out
blinding white and cool to a dull orange be the time they reach the
tail. 

Now *that* would be a nice looking ship. Of course, it\'d be about as
inconspicuous as a nuclear flare, but it\'d still be pretty.

> And then there\'s the robots emitting several kilowatts of

Only if designed badly. It shouldn\'t take *that* much power. Of course,
there are these problems with folks who don\'t realize that metals are a
lot weaker than multi-phase composite naterials... like bone... :-)

As John W. Campbell pointed out long ago, if you are confronted by a
human sized robot, with human proportions, and the standard metal alloy
limbs, you can just walk up and tie its arms into knots.

How do you tell? Set them down with the 1 facing you, and the 2 on top.
Now check and see which side the three is on, right or left.

Here\'s an adventure starting point for you. 

Have the players land on a planet that has the Transcon Thruways, and
all that goes with them. Get them into a car with someone and out in
the highspeed lane of the thruway, cruising at 500-600 mph. If you are
nice you\'ll let them get over being boggled. If not, you\'ll just start
the action (an accident, an attack, a heart attack by the driver,
whatever) before they can adjust.

Okay, I\'d guess that grav thrusters would work out there,  I beleive from 
watching "Bill Nye the Science guy"  Where they build a scale model of 
the Solar System, where the sun was a 1 meter beach ball, that 1000 
diameters is somewhere around Jupiter and 2000 is around Saturn.

This is a problem I\'ve had because I vaguely remember a discussion about

This has always been my greatest mis-giving about the inclusion of 
Grav-Thursters, if for some reason you wind up in the middle of the big 
black you\'re screwed, boned and f*cked in the biggest sence of the word. 
 You\'d never come back and no one would ever know what happened.  The 
rifts would be utterly impassable to ships without HEPLAR because you 
could never manouver into your deep space calibration point they\'d just 
watch you float by 100 yards off the starboard bow and there\'s nothing 
they could do to stop you.

Well, there\'s really not a mailing list specifically and exclusively for 
TNE...

traveller@mpgn.com is for discussions of all forms of Traveller, while
xboat@mpgn.com is for discussions of CT and MT.

Whether the TNE afficianados will want to split off and make their own 
list is unknown at this time. 

Thanks for posting.  I hope to hear more from you in the future!

FWIW, I painted Scouts mid-grey, Navy in blue, SDBs in black, and

FreeT in bright pink(!)...). Engines & guns in black. Dry-brushed in 
something lighter.

All right, all right, enough Hulk bashing. He could be the reason some of
those worlds are interdicted, you know. Imagine a race of Hulks running
around on some barren world  :)

Gee, that would be a truly evil thing to do to a group of players!

Ken that the softcovers have sold out.  I am sure this will encourage my

exist so that an improved second printing will occur soon.
2]   In regards to some desires for IG to produce an Advanced Combat system,
I would approve, but only with the following caveat:  Be true to T4.
I believe one of the early signs of decay of Classic Traveller was the
proliferation of rules and supplements, especially for ground combat.  There
was SNAPSHOT, which was similar to CT (but with a structured action system,
like a wargame but truest to CT\'s combat system and definitely playable);
there was AZHANTI HIGH LIGHTNING (nice on its own merits, but a system with
the concepts of penetration and a fixed damage results table modified by net
penetration... making it signifcantly different from CT), and STRIKER (more
similar to AHL, but able to handle massed battles and possessing a pre FF&S
design system).
    THREE distinct supplements... there was no unification with the core
rules except in SNAPSHOT, the earliest of the three.  NO WONDER MegaTraveller
was justified in its pre-release advertisments as a design intended to
"unify" the vast information and rules produced over the last 10 years.
     To IG: IF you should feel it necessary to produce advanced rules for
ground combat, or anything else for that matter (and this is controversial as
I think many players would prefer adventures, Mileau books for the different
backgrounds including beyond the time of TNE, as well as equipment and
starship lists [and design procedures beyond QSDS or SSDS... do I hear FF&S
2?]), IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO BUILD UPON THOSE SYSTEMS ALREADY IN PLACE IN
THE T4 CORE RULES.  People may quibble and whine about throwing tons of dice,
or its unsuitability for this and that, but as the system developers, you
must make it work. You have built a foundation in T4, use it to build upon
it, not away from it.
      Otherwise, we are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past
(MegaTraveller 2 aka T5).
      T4 is a good system, everything should stem from it.

        MARC MILLER, KEN WHITMAN AND ALL AT IMPERIUM GAMES: Excellent job.
Could have been a little better in the editing/proofreading department, but
with the deadlines you were working under, I\'m actually surprised things
weren\'t more screwy. I\'d also bet that some of these things were PRINTING
problems beyond your control. But the GAME itself is excellent! I also
appreciated how some of the things I liked best about TNE were retained, but
in the framework of a much smoother system.
        GUY "DEREK WILDSTAR" GARNETT: I missed all or most of the discussion
regarding QSDS, and as I\'m not on GDW-Beta (or is it IG-Beta now?) anymore,
I couldn\'t be on on it\'s design. You did an EXCELLENT job here. Maybe my
friend Dave Nelson will quit whining about the loss of FF&S now...
        LOREN WISEMAN: Delighted to see you here! I\'m no longer on AOL, but
now that I\'m back on here, maybe I\'ll drop you a line one of these days.
        ALL ON THIS LIST: T4 should bring the Traveller community together,
not push it farther apart. As more parts of the system are released, I\'m
sure it will be as good or better than TNE ever was (it\'s already far better
in some ways, such as being MUCH more compatible with what went before). I
enjoyed TNE and defended it vigorously, but I have to say I\'m pleased as
punch with T4.
        Now, howzabout we work up a good method of converting TNE characters

However, there were a few things that I wanted to say, and a few
comments I hope will spawn discussion.

First, let me say that I think IG did a great job.  A few typos, but I\'m
not complaining.  I really liked the Foss art.  I think it does an
excellent job of reminding me that this is Year 0 not 1115.  Oh, the
only Foss art I loathed was the weapon art.  8(  The interior is clean
and crisp.  I would have preferred inline art that had something to do
with the text it\'s near.  I think that it helps draw more attention to
the product as opposed to full page images.  But the heading are easy to
find and everything is laid out nicely.

I do agree with an idea voiced earlier; tell us what\'s going on in the
Foss art.  Hey, this is definitely the making of a JTAS article!

Okay, enough posturing.  Time for some discussion.  8)

I don\'t know if I\'m going to like the task system.  I\'ve always been a
fan of task systems that place more emphaisis on the skill as opposed to
the controlling attribute.  Good examples of tasks systems that do this
(and also just happen to be my favorites) are:  the task systems for
MegaTraveller, CORPS, and Heavy Gear.  In all of these, the controlling
attribute is used at a fraction of it\'s level (MT and CORPS), or as a
die modifier (HG).

I\'m pretty sure that Mr. Hostman will agree with me on this one.
Speaking of which, William, have you figured out the breakdown of
exceptional success, etc with the new system yet?

Also, what do people think of the experience system?  Some players I was
talking to aren\'t sure if they\'re too thrilled with the idea of gambling
experience away to some dice rolls.

The new combat system is definitely much more streamlined than TNE.  A
big plus.  I think this will definitely help in not scaring people off.
There\'s something to be said with presenting just the basics and adding
advanced stuff later (or at least in a different chapter).

Anyway, enough rambling, mostly I just wanted to see what other people
thought of these topics.

Good question. What would sf and general culture look like in the Far Future[tm]? Styles 
would come and go, but humaniti would take cultural baggage with him, good and bad, into 
the interstellar diaspora. 

How will prestellar Vilani and Zhodani "culture" adapt to the reality of starflight? The 
Zhos would be _very different_ from the rest of humaniti due to the impact psionics have 
had on their culture.

This is an area not often explored by us intrepid travellers. I\'d like to see other 
minds chew on the idea of defining a current culture for the various milleus. The work 
thought put into the culture and social outlook of RC society was one of the good (nay, 
GREAT) points of TNE.

Kinda like the way so many grognards despised TSR back in the early 80s (and I still do) 
after the SPI fiasco. Substitute "companies" for "shops," "TSR" for "GW," and delete the 
word "British," and you have an idea of my opinion of TSR.

Good on IG. I remember something from an old (The) Space Gamer about game ads terms and 
what they _really_ mean, and under "Preorders Accepted" it said something to the effect 
of "You get your game two weeks early, we get your monry two months early." Wonderfully 
cynical, but at least IG didn\'t charge your credcard _immediately_.

Back in the 80s, I thought SJG did this with all of those capsule reviews in TSG (ghods, 
how I miss it!!).

Maybe they are not hulks all the time and the world is not interdicted...like, say, 
during periods of intense solar flare activity (like the bad-but-not-the-worst one that 
forced their ship down on an Uncharted World[tm] . . .) and the PCs crash-land on a 
world that is host to a people normally as gentle as the "servants of Vol\' in that 
ST:TOS episode "The Apple."

Meanwhile, as the PCs race to repair their ship, the flares get worse. The energetic 
particles from the flares interact with strange chemicals in the atmosphere to cause a 
mutagenic reaction among the natives (not the PCs): from Peter Graves in a sheet to HULK 
SMASH!!!

No such thing as Traveller nonsense or drivel. But then again, this is the first time

Likewise. I\'m now running a small campaign to test out the rules, and so far, I\'m 
delighted with the results.

Hmmm...at least attributes won\'t really change too much in value, but skills will change 
radically. 

My Quick & Dirty conversion scheme: Attributes retain the same values, but AGL=DEX and 
CON=END. Skills convert at TNE Level 1-3 = T4 level 1, TNE 4-6 = T4 Level 2, and Levels 
7-10 in TNE = levels 4-6 in T4. I\'m assuming that since a skill cannot be improved above 
6 in T4, then 6 is the ceiling on skills. 

I invite commentary, flames, and random gunfire on this, and maybe _we_ can create a 
system for IG to publish in JTAS ;)

My personal preference is adventures in what IG is calling the \'Virus Era." but I\'ll 
take what I can get when it comes to Traveller\'s "13th Century." I\'m a die-hard Star

I am currently working on an advanced combat system for T4.  In fact I had
to stop work while I waited for my copy of the rules!  My system, _At close
Quarters_, focuses on the short range encounters most common in my long
Traveller experience.

It seems to me that most Traveller combat takes place in confined spaces..
ships, Ancient sites, Megacorp offices, etc...  I have focused on the
intensity of fire combat at contact range.

My system uses initiative points, similar to Snapshot\'s Action Points, to
control PC actions.  Players can lose IP by being wounded or having near
miss, failing morale checks, or by committing to long term actions.

The play stresses reaction time.. players are encouraged to conserve IPs and
move carefully, lest they blunder into a pirate ambush.  PCs can either
charge recklessly, or use good tactical movement.. It\'s their lives, their
choice.

I have worked hard to insure that play is fast and doesn\'t require
additional paperwork for the players.  I suggest that players use glass
pebbles (most people have them for Magic or something similar) to keep track
of their IPs.

The system is 100% compatable with Traveller, and is intended to serve when
a more detailed combat resolution is called for.

I don\'t cover more military issues such as heavy weapons, large scale
battles, and the like.  This is a system for adventurers.

Hopefully, I can sell this to IG, and Earn Big Bucks as a Professional Game
Designer!  Be a Man among men.  Stride the world in seven-league boots!

Hey, I could use the money, okay?

Any comments or suggestions are welcome.. a Very Rough draft will be up on
my web page by next weekend (7-8 September).

Now that I have so many copies of T4, I should probably use a highlighter 
to indicate the typos and such, then send it to IG. :)

Good advice.  I believe it will be possible to create quite detailed 
rules for various types of combat without invalidating the T4 rules.  IG 
has left the door open on a lot of things, and much of what they have 
defined allows room for expanding those rules.

As for me, I\'d be happy if someone came up with a set of tables to roll 
on to find out just what that Lo Ni Po cargo really is . . .

        Interesting research ... I find just the opposite is true for
myself. I dislike serif text fonts. I use "Souvienne" (serif) for all my
headings and either Arial or Eurostile for my text because it\'s much easier
to read and more visually appealing to me.

        But then I\'ve always been different ...

        James Dempsey\'s page has a FAQ; I\'ve got a section on painting
miniatures. Since I don\'t have his URL handy right now, just go to my
Traveller section, and look in the part labelled "Elsewhere." Painting is
under "Artwork."

        Sure. Mount an auxiliary HEPlaR or fusion drive if you want to move

accelerate real slow.

        Strange... the one that I got from Valet D\'Coeur up here in
Montreal was in mint condition and wrapped in virgin, intact plastic.
While I wouldn\'t put it past Valet to wrap their copies (they are a
brutally cool store), I\'d finger the guys at your local gaming stores...

        I would think that any gravitational field would do; gravity wells
are gravity wells...  which brings me to a problem: if you\'re using
grav-based plates dependent on the strength of the local grav well for
their acceleration, assume you take off from say Earth heading for Pluto.
Since Earth\'s gravity well is deeper than Pluto\'s you\'re in a situation
where you get much more acceleration leaving than you do arriving.  This
would have a serious effect on your flight plan: turnaround would have to
be much closer to Earth than Pluto, as you\'d build up a lot of speed
relative to Pluto while thrusting off of Earth that you couldn\'t counter in
Pluto\'s weaker gravity well.

        I kinda like non-grav T-plates better.

        When I come to one of these difficult spiritu..., er, physical
questions and I don\'t know where to turn, I always calm myself and find
guidance by asking myself: "What would Isaac Newton say?"

        I bet that Isaac would a) whack us all upside the head for being
cretins, b) immediately point out the flaws in the T-plate idea, c) lock
himself up in his study for a month and come out with a working T-plate
drive, and d) tell us that the momentum in your example would be conserved;
unless the ship met something to rob it of its momentum, it\'d just keep on
going..:)

        I think that "stuck" is a profound understatement, although it does
rhyme with a better way of describing the situation :).

A little more specifically than the other answers you\'ve 
gotten: 
 
the Traveller list (traveller@mpgn.com) is for Traveller 
in all forms, eras, rulesets, etc. 
 
the Xboat list (xboat@mpgn.com) is the list that branched 
off after TNE came out, since a not-insubstantial portion 
of the Traveller audience just couldn\'t abide TNE,  
so X-boat was reserved for CT/MT only discussion. 
 
Since the coming of T4, most of the reasons for the 
split have fallen by the wayside, and, in fact,  
message volume on Xboat is almost nothing.

hehehe.  Hey, I\'d like nothing more than a completely unified Traveller

Let\'s make Traveller the RPG of "inclusion." :P 

[For those not familiar with current American politics (lucky you!), both 
of our major political parties are claiming to be the "party of 
inclusion," while being /very/ selective in what their members are 
allowed to say on certain topics the party leaders have very strong

I say, let\'s throw out democracy and get ourselves an Emperor.  :)  Let\'s 
found a world-wide political party dedicated to bringing about a world 
government based on the Imperium.  Let\'s see now..what should we call 
ourselves?  "Millerites" sounds too much like a bunch of people who

Howdy,

You don\'t like the idea of each group making up its own planetary/system

I can definitely see where you\'re coming from here.  When I first found 
out about the task system, I thought..."Wow!  That is so cool!  Get rid 
of the 3+/8+/11+/15+ progression, use the stat as a basis, and vary the 
dice!  How elegant!"

But once I started playing around with it, I got a bit discouraged.  
"Geez, my guy with Survey-6 and Edu of 8 has the same chance of success 
as this other PC with Survey-2 and Edu of 12!  Arrghh!  Doesn\'t all 
that experience count for anything??"

Then I realized the implications of this system.  What IG has surmised is 
that someone who has a relatively high characteristic that is relevant to 
the task will benefit /more/ from the same amount of training and 
experience than someone who has a lower characteristic score.  Further, they 
decided that the characteristic was more important than the training /if 
the person had at least some training/.  

Example:  Stephanie and Vanna grew up together, attended the 
same high school, and enjoyed the same things.  After graduating, 
Stephanie went on to earn a Ph.D. in Physics (high Edu, high skill in 
Physics), while Vanna passed up higher education in favor of earning a 
decent paycheck right away (moderate Edu). 
Now, if you teach each of these folks the equivalent of Survey-1 (which 
uses as its basis Edu), who is more likely to excel at actually doing a 
survey?  Presumably, Stephanie has a broader base of knowledge because of 
her extra years in the educational system.  This should confer quite an 
advantage when determining "the precise characteristics of an unknown or 
unclassified world." [T4, p 47]

At least, that is how I have come to rationalize it. :)

Comments?

Hmmm.  I can see some players not liking it.  On the other hand, my CT 
players (back in CA, years ago) liked not having to worry about skill 
increases and experience at all.  After D&D\'s heavy emphasis on 
experience points for killing things, it was quite refreshing, and freed 
us up to explore other pursuits besides bashing monsters.

Personally, I prefer the T4 system.  But then, I posted a system here 
that was quite similar to it several months ago, so I\'m biased. :)

Both true.  While _real_ robots won\'t emit that kind of heat, Traveller
robots (ie. robots designed using the Traveller rules) do require that much
power.

In Book 8: Robots, for example, there\'s a pseudo-biological robot that uses
60kW - this robot could heat my house in a Canadian winter!

Good idea!  Then you have an excuse to buy another copy!  Or two!  Or THREE,

Seriously, I\'m so glad you are picking up the slack on multiple purchases of
the new game.  I *tried* to explain to my wife why I needed so many copies,
but she just pointed out the several hundred pounds of Traveller material,
some of it dating back to 1977, currently residing in our apartment.

I got her to agree to one hardcover and one softcover.  Now I just have to
explain the small temple I\'m building for my original black books and the
hardcover T4....

It depends on your industry, I guess.  I use Helvetica in my letterhead and
the text, which is too cutting-edge to be trendy yet among lawyers (many of
whom have never stopped using Times New Roman for letterhead and courier for
text -- to make letters look as typewritten as possible).

"Oh, you can tell that memo is from Makhidkarun.  They\'re still using that
ancient Helvetica font from the Interstellar Wars, when they use Galanglic
at all."

Radii yes, but not diameters.

The Sun is ~1.4Mk in diameter.  Jupiter is 778Mk out so it\'s about 555
diameters from the Sun. Saturn is 1426Mk out, so it\'s just over 1000
diameters out from the sun.  Uranus is about 2000 diameters out and Neptune
is about 3000.

Are you guys refering to Solar diameters as AU\'s?  An Astronomical Unit
(AU) is the distance from the Sun to the Earth, 149Mk. If the cut off point
for thrusters is 3000 AU\'s then they are good *way* beyond Pluto..way,
*way* out into the Ooot belt.

Actually, the SciFi channel is discouraged in the Third Imperium (not
censored, because the Third Imperium makes no pretense of being able to

Personal opinion...  I probably won\'t be running a T4 campaign until 
the release of Milieu 0 in December...  although looking at the way 
the hardcovers are coming, should I say January... ;-)

Because before TNE cocked around with "reality", a meson gun was much more
powerful than a scuzzy laser. And most of the ships were retained into TNE, even
though this and other things made it apparent that the rules describe a

But the greater your skill level, the more knowledge you suppossedly
have in a subject.  Assume that Steph has EDU 12 and Vanna 9.  Under MT,
Steph has +2 to the skill roll and Vanna only a +1.  So, the advantage
of a greater education while having the same level of training is
present.

However, let\'s say that Steph has EDU 12 and Survey 1 while Vanna has
EDU 9 and Survey 3.  Under MT, Steph has +3 DM (+2 EDU +1 skill), while
Vanna has +4 (+1 EDU +3 skill).  Vanna wins out because she has more
training in the task at hand (even a rocket scientist can\'t know
everything about anything).  However, under T3 (and TNE), Steph as a
target roll of 13, while Vanna has only 12.  So, in this case there is
no benefit to knowing more about the job at hand.

So, even though Steph may have a broader base of knowledge, she is still
better than Vanna who has specialized in a particular field and
understands that field\'s nuances.

Maybe I should just get to bed and realize that this is only a game.
Worse comes to worse, I can always just get around to that CORPS

Um, before I ask my question, first a quickie intro.  I\'m a computer
systems geek who works for a UK oil exploration company.  Last game of
Trav was about 15 plus years ago (dont even *know* what Mega Trav and
TNE are :-).  Read about T4 in last month\'s Arcane mag and said to
myself "Yum yum yum" (I\'m strange like that :-) - So I\'ve ordered a hard
back copy from IG and got myself on this list.  Intro over.

Here\'s a set of reasonably Trav oriented questions for you educated
types out there.  I am trying to get my head back into astrological
units et.al. for when I start to referee again.

1. What is the precise speed of light?

2. Can anyone give me rough dimensions of the Solar system (i.e.:
distance from earth to moon, and size of each of the orbits around the
sun).

3. What is an AU (distance wise) in Trav? - Is it a standard astro unit
in real life?

4.  Is a parsec (if I remember correctly) about 3.26 light years?  If so
why is this so significant?  Isn\'t this the standard size of a subsector
hex?  If so, why?

Many thanks,

A big problem with this is that an \'official\' published adventure can
contradict what your group has created.  This leaves you either branching off
from the common universe, having a sudden reality shift, or otherwise coping.
 Bit more work, whatever you do.

If this is accurate, then that is a *change* from CT/MT.  In the earlier
versions, it was explicitly stated that prospective Marine officers attend
the Naval Academy.  (This is also how it\'s done in the US, which provides
the model for how the Imperial military services are organized in general
- -- yes, I know there are some departures, but it\'s overall closer to the
US model than to anyplace else.)

> Can battle dress with life support be used in a vacume (space)?

Yes, it can.  According to Fire, Fusion and Steel, battle dress is sealed 
against vacuum by default -- it includes environmental control 
automatically, and even has filter/respirator fittings for thin/tainted 
atmospheres.  Unfortunately, in an oxygen-poor environment (such as 
space), the wearer turns blue pretty quick.  You\'ll need a Portable Life 
Support System (PLSS) from the back section of the TNE rulebook to be 
spaceworthy in battle dress.  Previous (MT) canon stipulated that battle 
dress came with standard fittings for PLSSs, and my TNE powered armor 
designs have included them within their storage volume, so that the 
wearer\'s precious oxygen is also protected.

> How do you design Vacc suits in TNE?

If the selection in the TNE rulebook is insufficient, I suppose that you 
would use the FF&S armor rules to design a flexible or semi-rigid suit, 
add environmental control to seal it, and then either design a visored 
(sealed) helmet to go with it or borrow one of the vacc suit helmets from 
the TNE rulebook, along with some other handy items, such as the self- 
sealing option.

> To what minimum pressures are Hostile Env Suits and combat armour useable?

Hostile Environment suits?  If you mean Hostile Environment VACC suits, 
then the minimum usable pressure would be, umm... vacuum?  As for combat 
armor, "it depends," mostly on whether there\'s environment control, a 
sealed helmet, and a PLSS available.  Combat Armor, per se, is similar to 
battle dress, except that it lacks the strength enhancements and other 
electronic goodies -- you have to carry it instead of the other way around.

> Can a Vacume belt (TNEp337) be used to augmet these?

I dunno.  What is a vacuum belt?

> The various rules RCES, FFS, and TNE are not clear on these points.

Sometimes, in order to get a usable answer, you need to ask a sensible 
question.

  Here are the mean distances, of course the orbits are not circular, so the
distances vary a fair bit, particularly Pluto.

  Earth to moon: 3.82 x 10^8 m

  Sun to Mercury:   57.9 x 10^6 Km
  Sun to Venus:    108 x 10^6 Km
  Sun to Earth:    150 x 10^6 Km
  Sun to Mars:     228 x 10^6 Km
  Sun to Jupiter:  778 x 10^6 Km
  Sun to Saturn:  1430 x 10^6 Km

  An AU is the distance from Earth to the Sun. It is used in real life, but
I am not sure how much. I guess it is a lot more meaningful for comparisons
than looking at figures in the millions.

  Well, you asked - It is "the distance at which 1AU would subtend an angle
of 1 second of arc." or "The distance at which a star would show a parallax
of 1 second of arc". I think it is mostly a pretty convenient measure of a 
very large distance. As well as being the standard size of a stellar hex, it,
apparently, is more often used than Light Years by astronomers too.

There it is, in the bottom line of the Body Pressure Suit table at the 
bottom, right corner of page 337 of the TNE rulebook.  "Vacuum Belt."  
The devil\'s in the details, ennit?

Since somebody\'s already explained what a Vacuum Belt is and answered Mr.

Very true.  The reason that doesn\'t conern me is that I only very rarely 
run published adventures. :)  But you\'re right, for those who do, they\'ll 
have to do some changing.

Then again, perhaps the new published adventures will not give all the 
details of the world it takes place on.  For instance, they might give 
the name of the world, the UPP, and of course details about the world - 
but not the location of the world.  Then the individual referee could 
place the adventure on whichever undetailed world he wishes.  That way 
there would be less chance for conflict between published and individual 
universes.

I think that\'s supposed to read Diameters not AU.  At that kind of AU

Hmmm.  I can see some players not liking it.  On the other hand, my CT 
players (back in CA, years ago) liked not having to worry about skill 
increases and experience at all.  After D&D\'s heavy emphasis on 
experience points for killing things, it was quite refreshing, and freed 
us up to explore other pursuits besides bashing monsters.

Personally, I prefer the T4 system.  But then, I posted a system here 
that was quite similar to it several months ago, so I\'m biased. :)
 

*************** MSG Start **********************

Perhaps for an experience system we could use something along the lines of 
Chaosiums where you check a skill that you used during a game and roll to see 
if you\'ve improved at the end of the adventure.  It\'s also setup so the more 
skill you have the harder the roll is (ie if you have an 85% Sneak, you have 
to roll OVER 85%, etc.) I don\'t know what kind of increment you could use 
since after 5 adventures you could - potentially - go up 5.  Maybe a tenth of 
a point for slow progression or a quarter point if you want faster 
advancement.  

I welcome comments - constructive please :) - on this.  Anyone?

Not me...  I know what an AU is and I\'d never confuse the two.   Well

I agree, but for central or well known locations, pregenerated sectors
would, to me, make sense, just for commonality - as part of the whole idea
of playing in the same mileau (sp?), so if I, say, move to Rome NY and fall
in with the group there, Deneb is still Deneb...  There are lots of
sectors/subsectors/systems not on the beaten path whose details should

I always figured that the odds of a missle fired from x distance way at a

I envision this as a civilian ship that got hijacked and transformed into a
pirate ship at some secret facility operated by a ring of pirates infesting
the outer fringe of the Imperium in Year 0 (which is, of course, much
smaller than it will later become.) I\'m sure I made some errors here and
there. I will say that the lack of rules for figuring out how much INTERNAL
space a vehicle takes up is a bit annoying. ALSO, I found no clear rules or
explanation regarding ship\'s computers as to size, capacity, what have you.

assuming until I hear differently.)

It\'s further evidence of a secret support facility, I suppose.) The ship
carries a stolen G-Carrier for use as an assault vehicle.

        I have an adventure that goes along with this, designed to kick off

   Trying to be succint as possible, I shall hit the highlights:
1]  The system is based largely on Classic Traveller, with range bands
representing 1.5m indoors and 15m outdoors, time scale of 6 seconds per
combat round.
2]   Actions allowable usually include a move and a fire, inless aimed fire
or going prone is performed.
3]   Armor works by subtracting its value from the damage (in dice) of the
weapon, for example, a laser rifle doing 7D of damage hits someone wearing a
rigid armor suit with a value of 3, a total of 4 dice of damage would be
done, EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT....
4]    MAXIMUM damage that can be inflicted in a single attack is 3D (!).
 This was justified in the rules by stating that higher dice attacks tend to
simply blow through and out of the target (presumably without imparting an
optimal amount of energy as damage).

that exceptions to this MUST exist (i.e. in T4, the only listed exception is
shotguns.. 4D).
Other exceptions which should be addressed in the future include shaped
charges, flamethrowers, high energy weapons (plasma and fusion guns), and
disintegrators.  There are probably more, but the above weapons should
probably have no restriction due to the efficiency of their transfer of
energy to damage a target and/or their reliance on thermal rather than
kinetic energy (also remember for what little canon existed for
disintegrators, they cause an effect at a target and thus aren\'t dependent on
the velocity of a "projectile or bolt" and they IGNORE armor if you recall
the MT space combat tables).
5]  The weapons list only goes up to the basics (lasers)
6]  Distribution of damage and damage effects are per CT (i.e. the three
physical characteristics... if all three are reduced to zero, the target is
dead.)
7]  You can now fire for specific effects including doubling and tripling
damage (after armor reduction), note, this may exceed the 3D damage rule.
8]   Tactics pools as DMs that can be drawn on a nonreusable basis per
encounter.  Optional STR, DEX, and END pools as well for HTH (armed and
unarmed) combat.

In short, a refined CT with some twists that need one to bear in mind to
allow for exceptions, and some chrome.  Definitely playable, and can be built
upon (or, <<sigh>> tinkered with).

This is what the T4 system is.  Well, you\'re given an experience point
or two or three (depends on the adventure) and then those points can be
used to grant a roll to see if you\'ve improved the skill (that was used
during the adventure).  So, if you use three skills and you get one xp,
you choose which skill to get a die roll for.  Equal or over the skill
and you increase it, under it and you don\'t.  It would seem a little
fairer if you got to roll for all the skills you used.

Here\'s the system I posted a while back (keep in mind this was created 
with CT in mind, as T4 wasn\'t even announced at the time):

==================

                Dynamic Characters for Traveller

     The basic Traveller system provides very limited rules by
which characters may change over time.  Book 2 outlines some 
rules for character improvement, but it requires eight years of 
a character\'s life in order to permanently gain one skill level.  
That may be a realistic system, but it is not one which increases 
enjoyment of the game.
     The following is an additional system by which a character\'s 
skill set may evolve during the course of his adventures.  It
has been found to increase the excitement in adventures by
encouraging daring and risky acts on the part of player
characters.  This system provides rules for gaining, improving, and
degrading skills..  It is meant as an addition to the Book 2 rules, 
not as a replacement.


Gaining New Skills

     In order to gain a new skill, a character must successfully
resolve a situation that would require that skill during the
course of an adventure.  If this occurs, at the end of the
adventure the referee should allow the player to roll 11+ for a
skill gain, with a positive DM of 1/2 the value of a related skill
(round fractions down).  When more than one skill is related to
the skill to be gained, only the one at the highest level is
used.
     In the case of weapons skill, a successful roll will yield a
skill of 1.  In all other instances, a skill level of 0 will be
received.  In either case, subsequent skill increases can be
attained using the rules outlined below, or through the course of
study given in Book 2.
     It is suggested that Jack-of-all-Trades skill not be used as
a "related" skill, as the knowledge granted by J-o-T is not great
enough to aid in the gaining of a new skill.
     Example:  Jyond, an ex-marine who has no survival skill, has
just completed an adventure wherein he had to live off of the land
while stranded on an uncivilized world for an extended period.
While his skill of Hunting-3 helped to some degree by giving him
meat, he also had to find sources of water and edible vegetation.
Through good judgment and some luck, Jyond survived this
ordeal.
     After the adventure is over and Jyond has been rescued, the
referee allows Jyond\'s player to roll 11+ with a DM of +1 for his
Hunting skill (3/2 = 1.5, rounded down to 1).  The player rolls 4
and 6, plus the DM of 1, yielding 11.  Jyond now has Survival-0.


Improving Current Skills

     In order to increase the level of skill a character has, the
skill must be successfully used during the adventure in such a way
that it would cause the skill to be increased.  High-risk uses of
the skill as well as using it in original ways are both examples
of this.  For instance, repairing an ATV while under fire as the
enemy advances steadily closer (Mechanical skill); piloting an
air/raft through twisting ravines to avoid radar detection
(Air/Raft skill); using a revolver to fire at a cable, severing it
and dropping 10 tons of cargo on the enemy group are all valid
specific instances wherein skill may be increased.
     Typically, two conditions must be met: first, the task must
be relatively difficult; second, success must have a great impact
on the adventure.  In the example above, the referee might have
imposed a DM of -4 to the roll for hitting the cable by firing the
revolver.  Assuming the character has a skill of Revolver-2, this
would require a roll of 10 or more on two dice for success.  This
is hardly a roll on which to pin the hopes of a band of
adventurers!  But, if all goes well, the adventurers will have
gained a significant advantage.
     The roll for increasing a skill is 7+, with a negative DM of
the current skill level.  In our example above, the player would
have to roll 9 or more on two dice to increase his Revolver skill
level to 3.  As you can see, this system does not allow for skill
increases beyond level 6.  If a character wishes to gain higher
skill levels, he or she must follow the rules outlined in Book 2.


Skill Degradation

     Unless a character is one of those rare individuals with a 
near-eidetic memory, skills which are not used will degrade.  
If a skill is not used at all within 180 game days, the character 
will lose one level of that skill (although the skill level will 
never fall below 0).  
     A single routine use of the skill during an adventure 
each 180 game days will keep the character from losing any skill 
levels.  If such usage is impossible for the character, then skill
degradation may still be avoided by engaging in one hour of non-
adventure use of the skill per skill level.  For example, a character
with Electronics-3 must engage in three hours of non-adventure 
skill  use each 180-day period or lose one skill level.   If the 
character has the time and materials necessary for exercise 
of the skill, then the player has only to inform the referee that 
his character will, from time to time, be undertaking skill 
maintenance activities.  But if, for whatever reason, the character 
is unable to complete the requisite number of hours of skill 
maintenance activities for a given 180-day period, then the 
skill level will be lost.
     If the process for a skill increase (as outlined in the 
previous section) is completed within a year of the date on 
which the skill level was lost, the result will be that the skill 
level will return to its earlier, pre-degrade level.  In addition, 
the player may roll an unmodified 7+ in order to gain an 
additional level.
     If such exceptional skill usage is not made within a 
year (including a successful die roll as outlined in the previous
section), the skill level is permanently lost, and can only be 
increased using the procedure outlined in the "Improving 
Current Skills" section, above.


Using the Dynamic Character System

     Referees and players should keep in mind that a character may
never have more skill levels than the sum of his intelligence and
education characteristics.  This puts a restraint on which skills
players attempt to improve or add.  Because of this, players
may of course choose not to attempt skill improvement or gain in
some instances.  The referee will determine whether the character
may gain a skill as a result of his actions, but the player
decides whether to use that opportunity.  Additionally, a player may
decide to let one or more of his character\'s skills degrade, which will
also make room for more skills or skill levels.
       Use of the above system, in conjunction with the system given
in Book 2 of the Traveller rules, will create a more dynamic and
exciting universe for the players and the referee.

No, that\'d merely be *evil*. To qualify as *incredibly* evil, they need
to find out that an interdicted world more or less corresponds to the
Earth found in the Marvel Universe. So it ain\'t just the Hulk. It\'s
also the FF, Avengers, X-Men, and all their enemies!

planetoid belt formed when the single habitable world was destroyed.
The world was of gas giant mass, but in the star\'s habitable zone (like
some of the newly discovered planets we\'ve found). Apparently it was
massive enough that it was on the edge of having most of the core go
degenerate, and something managed to trigger the change, which released
enough energy to blast the planet into pieces.

The other system is a six parsecs away, but even so, it\'s the nearest
star to the one with the destroyed world. This system has a rather
normal type G star. And the mainworld is fairly Earth-like. It\'s been
settled by the survivors of the ruined planet. They have *very* high
tech, but due to the great distances involved, they\'d not gone to the
stars until it became obvious that their planet was going to be
destroyed. They managed to build a couple of large ships with a highly
experimental jump-6 drive and get enough people and materials to the
new system to preserve their culture.

The G system is interdicted not only because of their high tech, but
because while humanoid, their native planet resulted in a race that has
some highly unusual abilities in a "normal" environment.

The M system is interdicted for several reasons. First of all, there
may be artifacts that survived the breakup of the planet. Next, there
is some worry that the survivors might take it amiss if they ever
caught folks poking about the remains of their old home (though oddly,
they don\'t seem to have visited it themselves other than a couple of
expeditions that returned to their new home rather hurriedly). And
finally, the remains seem to emit some odd radiations. They seem to be
harmless to humans, but no one is taking chances.

Oh yes, the natives called the destroyed planet "Krypton"...

It\'s rather more complicated. These things violate conservation laws
just by *operating* unless you have them work in ways that don\'t much
resemble the way folks expect them to work.

If you have them pushing on the nearest object, then the only way they
work is if the energy input is equal to the kinetic energy change
*relative to the object*. Thus, if it takes X amount of energy to
accelerate to 1 km/s, it takes *three times* as much to get to 2 km/s.
	Ke = m V^2/2
The mass of the vessel is constant. So at 1 km/s we have:
	X = m (1)^2/2
	X = m 1 /2
	X = .5m

At 2 km/s we have:
	X = m (2)^2/2
        X = m 4/2
        x = 2 m

So the difference is 1.5m, which is indeed 3 times the energy required
for 1 km/s.

So we get this (assuming a mass of 1):
	E = .5 m V^2

V	total E	delta E	adjusted
- ----	----	----	----
0	0	0	0
1	.5	.5	1
2	2	1.5	3
3	4.5	2.5	5
4	8	3.5	7
5	12.5	4.5	9
6	18	5.5	11
7	24.5	6.5	13
8	32	7.5	15
9	40.5	8.5	17
10	50	9.5	19

Obviously high speeds are *very* impractical.

If we instead assume that you can somehow convert energy directly into
Kinetic energy things get equally interesting. You use the "energy
equals force times distance" rule. Which means that to accelerate at 1
gee for a distance of one meter will always take the same amount of
power! Trouble is, the distance goes up as the *square* of the time,
meaning that your power requirements go up likewise:

	V = A T
	D = .5 A T^2
	E = V D

T	V	D	E	delta E	adjusted
- ----	----	----	----	----	----
0	0	 0.0	0.0	0	0
1	1	 0.5	0.5	.5	1
2	2	 2	4	3.5	7
3	3	 4.5	13.5	9	18
4	4	 8	32	18.5	37
5	5	12.5	62.5	30.5	61
6	6	18	108	45.5	91
7	7	24.5	171.5	63.5	127
8	8	32	256	84.5	169
9	9	40.5	364.5	108.5	217
10	10	50	500	135.5	271

Sheesh! This is even *more* of a power hog!

Reaction drives don\'t have this problem, because what counts with them
is the *exhaust* velocity, which is always measured relative to the
*ship*. 

I\'d really like to see some "thruster plates" that worked this way. It
would require the typical "handwaving" physics, but it wouldn\'t do
gross violence to the basics. And it\'d make for some interesting
playing.

True, but in most civilized games, you only get two or three points, and
they\'re used as standard awards for all the players.  Thus, everyone
gains the same experience.  Usually, my group will give out an extra
point to the people that roleplayed the best, but that\'s just us.

Lots of games are going this route now.

I\'m glad somebody else pointed this out...  In a perfectly just 
world, where everybody could hire the same quality legal team, this 
would probably be the case...  Unfortunately, as Microsloth, IBM, the 
NFL vs. USFL case, and others in recent years have shown, antitrust 
cases usually come down to who can hire the best battery of 
lawyers...  Usually, its the private company, not the 
government...and who do you think is going to have better lawyers:  
Games Workshop or Ma and Pa Kettle\'s local game store, that was 
barely in the black before GW moved into town...

On the other hand, the nature of a GW store that sold ONLY GW 
products wouldn\'t be all that successful IMHO...  More likely a GW 
store is only going to carry fast movers...  T$R, GW, White Wolf, 
Star Wars & Star Trek because of the license recognition, Magic: The Gathering 
of $$$$...  Little to no wargames, little to no other CCG\'s or RPG\'s...  Little 
companies just would find such a development to be 1 more barrier to entry...

Personal opinion:  Such a development is inevitable to a certain 
extent...  

Any lawyers on the list choose to kibbitz on this one???

Finally got home to see this last night...

Not happy.  Too human like.  Definitely a human in a furry suit (and 
not to furry at that).  I don\'t mind a variation on the previous 
Keith Bros. themes, but this is way too space operatic for my taste.  
Much prefer the previous CT & MT drawings...

On the other hand this is a rough sketch, so let\'s hope somebody 
takes a few of the comments from here, and the finished product is a 
little different...

> 1.	FIRST REALLY GOOD GAME STORE
> 

Flying Buffalo Games operated a game store for years in Scottsdale, 
and later Tempe, before Rick Loomis decided to get out of the game 
retail business, and focus on the PBM games his company is more 
famous for...

Not only did I buy most of the wargames, and about 80% of my CT stuff 
from there, but you\'d frequently run into members of FBG\'s staff 
there...  Liz Danforth (did a lot of the CT artwork), Mike Stackpole, 
and others...

The game store I frequent most here is Waterloo Adventure Games, in 
Gilbert, AZ...   The store is about the size of a small drug store, 
and stacked floor to ceiling with games, miniatures, RPG books, 
CCG\'s, including a TON of out of print and rare items.  The owner is 
knowledgable, and 1 of the few people in Phoenix who had as much 
information about the upcoming T4 release as I did...

It\'s about 20 miles away from where I live, but well worth the 
drive...

Certainly this gives a convenient excuse to actually paint stuff in 
primary colors...  Wonder at what TL the "chameleon option" is 
available at...

OTOH, I have an aversion to painting SF & Fantasy miniatures in matte 
black anyways...

BTW, has anybody considered that by the time you have a ship in 
"visual range" in deep space, he\'s probably been close enough to fire 
several salvoes of missiles at you...  Remember, we\'re not talking 
about dogfighting aircraft here.  Typical space combat ranges are 
going to measure in the 100K\'s of miles range...

Not trying to provoke a flame, just thought I\'d get a few comments...

Sorry, what you asked for was astrology (we astro types are a tad
sensitive on the subject (a GF of mine was a dance major, man, I got
lots of "astrology" questions at theater parties, yeesh! :-))

I can look them all up for you, but it would be more useful for you
to check out a basic astronmy book.  A long time ago I was given a
book called the "Atlas of the solar system" by RAnd McNally.  It has
proved useful for giving people ideas about what different types of
worlds look like, as well as scale.

The moon\'s about 400,000km away (ballpark) as I recall.  I\'m sure
there\'s a web page with all this in a table.

Yes.

It\'s a parallax measurment of distance.  Look at a star now, look at
it in 6 months, compare the difference in position.  You know the
size of our orbit, so you can triangulate the distance. The half
angle is actually used.  Something that has a half angle of 1 second
of arc of parallax is 3.26 ly away from us, so that\'s a parsec.

(correct me if I\'m wrong, this is off the top of my head)

Yes, and no... I think that there must be a ballance between skill and
attribute. I think that TNE was too much attribute, cause of the d20.
Pistol 6 on average guy in T4 is one helluva shot; he can make double
damage called  snapshots to short range, and screw up one in 36 times...

not the numbers yet... have been too busy at work to crunch them. Give me

I like it... it is a blend of sheer genius and realism. You see, since T4
experience must be spent IMMEDIATELY, and rolls are the ONLY thing it can
be spent upon, it works. The checking of skills when used tells what is
available. On my homegrown (25 skill lines) Character sheet, I\'ve added a
check-box for experience purposes. The only hitch I see with the experience
system is that levels 0 and 1 both automatically raise when exp is thrown
at them. So, in my game, a one on an exp check will always fail.

Wrong... the upper limit is 12, since there is a procedure for doing level
7+ skills. So, I\'d simply convert by going straight across. No changes.
Then total skill levels up, and, if below (age-12), allow rolls on the T4
tables to catch up. Same with Mega or CT.

Ooo!  Don\'t call \'em astrological units..not unless you\'re going to ask the

astroNOMical units.

Ok, definitions time! <g>

AU (Astronomical Unit) ~150million kilometers, is the distance from
    the Sun to the Earth.  AU is a convenient unit that is often
    used in astronomy when referring to distances within the solar
    system.  No *direct* game purpose.
    
ParSec (Parallax Second) ~3.26 (I use 3.25 <g>) light years.  I
    won\'t go into *why* a parsec is the distance it is, but just say
    it is a convenient measure of distance.  For game purposes, a
    parsec is the distance from the center of one subsector hex to
    the center of another, and the ~distance by which jumps are
    measured..in one interpretation of the rules anyway.
    
SD (Solar Diameter) The diameter of the Sun ~1.5million kilometers.
    This is a measure that *I* use in the game for several purposes.
    In Traveller, a ship should be 100 diameters (for safe
    operation) and 10 diameters (for moderately safe) from *any*
    large masses before engaging it\'s Jump Drive.  It just so
    happens that 100 Solar Diameters is about 1 AU.  <g>
    
Distances from Sun (Really Loose Approximations)

Mercury      .4AU
Venus        .7AU
Earth       1.0AU
Mars        1.5AU
Asteroids   2.5AU
Jupiter     5.0AU
Saturn     10.0AU
Uranus     20.0AU
Neptune    30.0AU
Pluto      40.0AU

And the Moon is 400,000km (240,000miles) from Earth.

Yes agreed. The trend however definitely is headed toward attribute based skills 
with notable exceptions from older systems still used such as the Chaosium % 
system

I\'m on a couple of groups at the moment, and you are the second person to rave 
about the Heavy Gear system. Somebody outlined it tom me and it sounded 
excellent. Would there be a seamless way of intigrating that task system with T4 
as a variant? I imagine characteristics would be a problem.

Er is that heresy? :-}

The real problem is the time lag.  Gravitational effects propigate
at the speed of light and if you push off of a planet that is
a light hour away, then you are going to have a an hour lag
on your drive.

I kind of prefer generic reactionless thrusters.  I would have
them push in the direction they exhaust just because I find
thruster plated too sterile.

I agree. I\'ve still got a bunch of the old Citadel Miniatures. Maybe
somebody could buy the molds from Games Workshop. They were gorgious. I
hated having to play Striker with 25mms. And just THINK of all those old
15mm starship grids we had... (sigh)

I\'m new to this list and I have been lurking about, the thread about task 
systems prompted me to ad my .02CR.

General Def\'s to ensure we\'re speaking the same language:

Attribute: General, natural aptitude and ability; difficult to improve upon.
Skill: Specific experience; gained through training, trail and error, etc.

In The Real World(tm) an ideal task system would mean that each person has far 
more than 6 measly attributes, and each task could depend upon several 
different attributes and skills. Traveller, being a game, needs a necessary 
abstraction and generalizes our many attributes into six, and keeps track of 
only those skills relevent to adventures in Far Future. (no Flower Arranging-6 
until we meet a race which navigates through space with a specialized Flower 
Arranging computer interface)

Now I don\'t have my T4 yet (aargh, the waiting is killing me) but from what I 
gather, the target roll is the addition of attribute and skill, and the number 
of dice you get to roll determines the difficulty. So, the question has been, 
does T4 give adequate relative weight to Attributes and Skills when determining 
the success of a task at hand?

Well, I would argue that weight given to attributes would depend upon the task 
which the character is trying to accomplish.

While I agree that Vanna may have more experience in the field of Survey, would 
that mean that she would have a better chance of *succeeding* in the task at 
hand? Not necessarily. Perhaps, she would do the job more efficiently, taking 
less time, resources, etc. Steph may indeed have a better chance at succeeding 
given her natural ability conferred to her through her education.

Some people would argue that there are certain tasks that *do* require a 
certain amount of the relevant experience to accomplish.

Well, I don\'t know if this will break any laws of statistics, but what you 
could do is the following:

a) choose a minimum skill level required. 
b) if the character has that skill level or higher, do task normally
c) otherwise first *subtract* the minimum skill level from the attribute, then 
add the character\'s actual skill.

Using Stef and Vanna\'s example, lets say the ref decides that this survey 
mission is so different and alien that only those with extensive survey 
experience (Survey-3) have a decent chance of succeeding. So, if Steph has EDU 
12 and Survey 1 while Vanna has EDU 9 and Survey 3, Stef needs 12-3+1=10 and 
Vanna needs 9+3=12, giving Vanna\'s survey experience and expertise the nod in 
this situation.

ON the other hand, in another game system, Stef is piloting her m\'gh*spth\'!tr 
science vessel through unknown space and has to avoid collision with a rogue 
comet. She doesn\'t have time to put together a really GREAT flower arrangement 
through her computer interface, so the ref decides that her Aesthetics 
controlling attribute of 12 isn\'t as important, and the computer will accept no 
less than Flower Arraging-5 in order to avoid the comet. Well, her skill level 
is 4, so she needs a roll of 11 to avoid collision...

Just a thought.

I\'ve retitled this from your original post -- "astrology" is a divinatory 
technique making use of the positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets of 
the Solar System, while "astronomy" is the scientific study of these 
objects and other bodies in space.  I think you mean the latter. :)

This info is all over encyclopediae, the Web, et al, but two basic 
distances will get you started:

Earth-Luna:      400,000 km        1.25 light-seconds
Earth-Sun:   150,000,000 km        8    light-minutes

150 million km, 93 million miles, the mean Earth-Sun distance.  And yes, 
it\'s the standard unit for discussing solar system distances in real 
life.  It stands for "Astronomical Unit".

Yes, it is.  This is the distance at which an object will display a 
parallax of one second of arc when viewed from opposite sides of Earth\'s 
orbit around the Sun (a 2 AU baseline).  "PARallax SECond" leads to the 
contraction "parsec".  It\'s a unit of convenience...you can convert a 
stars parallax in arcseconds into a distance in parsecs by just taking 
the reciprocal.  It\'s a useful unit because most stars in our part of the 
galaxy are separated by one or two parsecs from their neighbors.  Thus 
Trav quite reasonably picked it as the hex size.  A map with light-year 
hexes would be *much* sparser.

One figure that I liked using in TNE was the megameter (Mm), a thousand
times bigger than the kilometer.  It\'s a lot cleaner to speak of sensors
with ranges of 300 Mm instead of 300000 km, and then I didn\'t have to 
worry about how big a hex was -- MT\'s 25 Mm or TNE\'s more logical 30 Mm.
One AU is 149.6 thousand Mm (or 149.6 million km, pick your poison).

This is because one of the better ways to calculate distance to a stellar
object is by using parallax.  Converting from parallax shown to parsecs in
range basically involves dividing one by the parallax observed.  And in case 
anyone is curious, a parsec is about 206265 AU.  (Or as they say in the 
Imperial Marines, 
  "It\'s a long way to alpha Centauri, / It\'s a long way to go....")

This is sort of true but not completely. The heat you absorb from sunlight
comes in mostly at visible light wavelengths, the heat you radiate comes
out at 10-20 microns, so what you want (ideally) is a material that\'s 
relatively light/shiny in the visible and black in the IR. There are many
materials that satisfy this (clear anodized aluminum, for example.) Since most
Traveller players don\'t have access to 10-20 micron cameras, you probably only
need to worry about the visual appearance while painting...so paint it 
whatever color you like, preferably fairly light colored.

Also, the heat loads for Traveller spaceships are (probably) dominated by
waste heat from the power plant (see the recent long, inconclusive radiator
thread on gdw-beta), so sunlight reflection/thermal emission isn\'t very
important. 

re: camoflage and colors for military ships: visual spotting is somewhat
important, in fact; TNE (and presumably T4) passive sensors integrate
information over a variety of wavelengths, and there are situations where 
reflected visible light is an important part of a ship\'s signature. Not the
most important part, usually - thermal IR is probably where ships are most
easily detected - but fairly important. I\'d say any EMM-equipped ship 
probably implicitly has a black/dark grey hull, non-EMM ships are dominated
by their thermal emission and can be any color you like.

Yep.  That\'s one reason why we decided on the distance limit over on the
Beta list.  (I wrote the basic description of thruster plates that wound
up on the Golden Web Pages, and did some example math for the list of what
might constitute a good cut-off value).  We wanted to provide an advantage
to old-fashioned HEPlaR under some circumstances, rather than making
thrusters an all-around improvement.  Particularly if they\'re gravitically
based, lack of a gravity field seems a good idea, and also explains why,
in CT/MT, so much was made of deep-space refuelling bases being built
around brown dwarfs or rogue comets instead of a manufactured facility/
fuel dump: the very mass of the rendezvous allows efficient thruster use. 
However, rather than banning thruster use entirely (which I at first
supporter), I think the "new canon" has an efficiency drop of 99% or so. 
You can move: you\'re just awful pokey.  :-)

Its the standard unit for measurement of interstellar distances (here on
good old Earth) because, as Merrick pointed out, it is the quantity we can
measure directly  -- that is, its 1 over the paralax, the angular movement
of a star attributable to Earth\'s revolution around the Sun.

If you convert a measured paralax (which has an error) to, say, light years,
you depend upon the accuracy of the AU (a measured quantity with an error)
and the speed of light (measured: yet more error).  Instead of letting all
those errors have a party in your data, you just talk about what you have
measured directly.

One presumes, given the accuracy of jump systems, that along with jump drive
some rather more accurate methods of measuring interstellar distances have
been developed by year 0.

Instead of subtracting the minimum skill level for a situation in which a 
ref wanted a minimum skill level of competence, perhaps it would be more 
intuitive to say that for any skill level under the minimum, the 
character would be treated as unskilled, ie. use *half* the controlling 
attribute then add skill.

For the example above, Stef would need a (12/2)+1=7 and and Vanna 9+3=12. 
This would *really* make the skill level more important than the 
controlling attribute.

Does this make sense?

 How about(for a milleu 0 less so but more TNE oriented) the "God of
Thunder" would be a very wealthy person in command of a meson site(and
assorted nasties) whose brain got damaged during coldsleep and some of the

[cough]  Well, uh, I\'m guilty of that, too.  Fortunately, my wife is a much

I suggest starting with white marble shelves.  They set off the black CT

Until someone produces a Marine equivalent of the Military Academy, I\'m 
going to allow graduates of that Academy to choose enlistment in Army or 
Marines at O1 upon graduation.  Why leave the Marines out of the

Although I don\'t own any of the CT 15mm miniatures, I\'m a traditionalist, 
so I agree with you.  I\'d like to see T4 use 15mm miniatures.

However, I seem to recall something being said at Gen Con about using 25mm 
miniatures.  But, I can\'t remember for sure...

So you feel IG should have provided stats on a whole sector or more, 
rather than the few planets in T4?  You\'re right, that would be helpful, 
but it would be hard to justify.  The Imperium is just beginning in 
Milieu 0, after the Long Night.  I think it makes more sense to have only 
a few core planets defined, given that.

Alternatively, IG could have provided /referees/ with the UPPs of more 
planets while leaving the information off of maps to be shared with players.
But, I think that would be a non-optimal solution.  Not only would it be 
possible for players to spoil things by buying the book(s) containing 
this information, it would also make all campaigns run in Milieu 0 after the 
first have few "unknowns" for players. 

I like the idea of customizing the setting each time I start a new 
campaign in the same milieu. :)

It does to me.  And it\'s way better than what that Glenn Hopper guy who 
you were responding to came up with. :)

Seriously, I like it.  Let\'s say the ref decides that it takes Medical-4+ 
to do brain surgery.  If Stephanie has Medical-3 and Dex 12, while Vanna 
has Medical-4 and Dex-8, the targets would be (12/2)+3=9 and 8+4=12, 
respectively.

It works for me, and I can see a lot of situations where it could be 
applied to good effect.  Plus, it leaves the decision for which tasks 
require a minimum skill level (and what that minimum skill level is) in 
the referee\'s hands - a good thing in my estimation.

Good Job, Glenn!

        I\'ve been thinking about this one a little bit since Ross Coburn
raised the specter of himself playing one-on-one basketball with Michael
Jordan.  Ross rightly pointed out that despite the fact that he\'s generally
a pretty coordinated guy, and likes basketball, Michael Jordan\'s base
characteristics are such that no amount of training on Ross\'s part would
enable him to win.

        For those of us who have a good idea of Ross\'s characteristics,
this is instantly comprehensible :).

        On the other hand, let\'s take me & my old fencing coach, Herr Obst.
Despite the fact that I am several inches taller than Herr Obst, am
somewhat skinnier (both of which really help in epee), and have the usual
youth-related physical advantages, even at the peak of my form (four-five
years ago, when I was fencing for McGill), I wouldn\'t have had a snowball\'s
hope in hell of beating the guy.  Despite my superior characteristics, his
superior skill is such that I will have to wait until he\'s 95 or so before
having a hope of beating him.

        It\'s an interesting question, actually... in some areas training is
all-important, in other\'s it\'s native talent.  Maybe a system that left the
weighting of each up to the ref might better reflect reality.

Hmm.  I don\'t know enough about fencing (heck, I don\'t know /anything/ 
about fencing!) to be able to discuss it with you. :(

However, perhaps this can springboard us into a discussion of . . .

Is there some simple rule-of-thumb we could use to define when skill is 
of primary importance vs. when characteristics are of primary importance?
An example might be physical skills vs. mental skills (I know, that 
doesn\'t hold up - it\'s just an example).

The review itself is only about 1/6 of a page (after you take out the

The review is generally favorable, noting that the book is "quite

"the skill system is sharp," etc.

However, they note that the book could use more examples.  Specifically, 
lengthy examples for the complex subjects like ground combat.  Also, the

It\'s not a glowing review, but perhaps it will get a few people to check

This gives a nice feel for the Marines... You can\'t lead until you have
followed.  Puts the Noble fops in their place.  (I imagine some Marine Drill
thusly:  "M\'Lord Philip? Duke of Nova Cartago? GET DOWN AND DO PUSH-UPS

listed in the skill listing as being the primary characteristic related

I only counted the number of times each characteristic is listed /first/ 
in the Skills List.  The results are surprising.  Dex, Int, and Edu each 
have more than 20 skills that list them as primary characteristics.  
Strength has 1, End has 4, and Soc has 2.

Usefulness outside of the skills range:  Strength has usefulness in 
hand-to-hand attacks (the Strength pool), as one of the "hit point" 
characteristics, and in carrying things; Endurance is used 
for the Endurance pool (to determine the number of fully effective attacks 
one can make), and as one of the "hit point" characteristics; and Social 
Standing can be useful if one has a very high score - good contacts, etc.

This helps to balance the usefulness of the characteristics.  However:

1)  In addition to being a much-used characteristic in tasks, Dexterity is 
useful in avoiding being hit by hand-to-hand attacks, and as one of the 
physical characteristics that acts as "hit points.".  This is a pretty 
useful characteristic to have a high score in.

2)  Social standing is the least useful characteristic, except at very 
high levels. (Or am I forgetting something?)

The rest of the characteristics (Strength, Endurance, Intelligence, and 
Education) seem pretty balanced in terms of their importance.

Soooo..if one is using one of the alternate character generation methods, 
AND if one is the type of player that wants to max out his character\'s 
potential in terms of raw statistics, it might be wise to put the best 
roll on Dex, and the worst roll on Soc.

Still, the T4 system is one of the most balanced games in terms of 
the usefulness of characteristics that I\'ve seen.

Sorry...it\'s late, and I\'m rambling.  I\'m going to bed . . .

Not to mention the fact that the Keith Brothers had a whole lot to do 
with defining not only what the aliens looked like, but also what 
they acted like in many cases...  Take a look through old JTAS\'s...  
Just about all the major races got their first writeups from the 
Keith Brothers...

Correct me if I\'m wrong...but wouldn\'t it more appropriate for

Well I didn\'t get much of a responce the first time I put forth my 
request for creative critisim, so being an undetured Canuckle Head, I 
shall once again put forth my request.

http://www.usa.net/~goldendj/Traveller/Resources/Wilds.html

I\'ve sent a number of articles to Dave Golden\'s page and they have been 
posted to his Resources Page.  My pages are all linked to the "Wilds" 
section of his page, now I realize that this is largely TNE specific and 
before you start reaching for your crosses and wooden stakes remember I\'m 
not asking you to agree with the system, I\'m asking for critisim on the 
construction layout and general content of the pages.

I\'m also asking for critisim on my writing style and the manner in which 
the information is presented, now I know from reading most of the posts 
that have been floating about on T4 that you\'re all capable of presenting 
your own opinion.  So give it a try, check out the Wild\'s page and the 
links contained there in.  I realize several of the links go no where 
that\'s an oversight that I\'m working on.

So here\'s that address again.  Check it out and let me know what you 
think.  It\'s a long weekend so don\'t tell me you haven\'t got time.

http://www.usa.net/~goldendj/Traveller/Resources/Wilds.html

Thanks in advance.

Count me in.  I have resolved that if a certain politician is elected come

    'body' => '        Here\'s the procedure I\'ve been using to convert characters to the
new game.

1.) Attributes as for TNE, with 1 added to each one. (Traveller uses 2d6;
TNE used 2d6-1.) Charisma is of course dropped. (ALTERNATIVE: Divide the
Charisma stat by 3 and let the character take that many levels in skills
from the Charisma Cluster)

2.) I assume that T4 skill equals TNE skill/2. Thus a Slug Weapon(Slug
Pistol)-10 becomes Pistol-5. Skills that are at level 1 or level 0 are dropped.

3.) I assume an average of 5 levels per term for a character with 4 terms or
less, 4 levels a term for characters with 5+ terms. I total up the skill
levels assigned above; if they do not add up to the proper total, I begin
reinstating level 1 and level 0 skills dropped above at 1 level per skill
until the proper total is reached.
IF you have a complete record of the character\'s service career (my players
are sloppy about record keeping sometimes), you could calculate EXACTLY how
many levels the character is supposed to have.

4.) Equipment is handled by giving the character the closest equivilents, or
by fudging stats for the stuff T4 doesn\'t cover yet. (Anyone have a T4
version of the Crunch Gun?)

        I know this isn\'t the most accurate formula in the world, but it
handles the characters well, and allows people to play characters that are
on a par with T4-generated ones. Suggestions for improvements that preserve
the general simplicity of the system (or add only minor complexities) would
be highly welcome.

I think Marc and friends means AUs so gravthrusters have a range of several
thousand AU thus making them useful everywhere in a solar system and
probably between far binaries as well (Scouts have  far binaries at 1D6 x
1000 AU apart).

Somebody asked what real world use Parsec has for astronomers. Well if you
take a picture from earth at some stars and then again 6 months later when
earth is on the other size of its orbit a star that has apparantly moved on
arcsecond is at one parsec range. This is the best way to measure the
distance to nearby stars.

I think you\'ll also find the phrase "and Loren K Wiseman" on the
majority of those writeups.

Loren "If thou tootest not thine own horn, none will tootle it for
thee" Wiseman

P.S. The basic point, however, is well taken. Bill and Andy defined
the look of Traveller, and I for one liked it _very_ much. My decision
to hire Bill to do artwork for JTAS is arguably the best thing I ever
did for Traveller. BTW, the K in Loren K Wiseman stands for

A reasonable compromise would be to provide a starmap (location/size/spectrum
 only) because that can be done by observation from Sylea.  Define one axis
of exploration/conquest as \'official\', the other as \'open\', and keep the
official adventures to the official area.  Referees setting a campaign in the
open area wouldn\'t have to worry about being overwritten; referees lacing the
time/inclination to do their own thing could rely on a continuing series of
adventures in the official area.

IMHO, the problem with specifying just a planet and letting the referee site
it is that few planets are isolated.  It\'s rather like specifying Canada
without the USA: they are different countries (despite what many Americans
think) but very significant to each other (each is the other\'s largest
trading partner).

Now, if your game tends to ignore politics and economics, this isn\'t
important.  But if your players are diplomats, merchants, spies, etc then the
relationship between systems becomes significant (proximity, politics,
economy, culture...) - which makes it hard to relocate an adventure with
these elements to "a world with a feudal technocracy and insidious
atmosphere".

You probably aren\'t, assuming that T4 is like CT/MT/TNE.  On the other hand,
America is a fairly classless society, and one in which class is determined
mainly by money.

If you had grown up in Britain, you would realize that class can make a great
difference.  Having the right accent, the right parents, going to the right
school... all affect your life far more than they do in North America.

In my game, I use social  level as the characteristic for many tasks:
everything from getting a good table at a restaurant to clearing customs
quickly.

I\'ve got nothing against the sword, the makeup, or the style of dress.
My only beefs were the anatomically incorrect hands.

Just some food for thought (it goes with my first sentence):  why aren\'t
the Aslan of 1000 years ago allowed to be different from the Aslan of
CT/MT?  Hasn\'t our society changed drastically in that time?  Why can\'t
they also have a past?

Hey, look at the Scots.  How about the kilt?  The kilt of today is
definitely not the kilt of 1200, 1500, 1700, nor 1800.  Neither are the
weapons that the Scots carried.  The point is that as time, technology,
and society changes people (and Aslan, and Klingons) change as well.

: In my universe, at least, the Aslan will look like they did in CT/MT.

        Sorry, I\'d disagree. I prefer 25mm figures for roleplaying games
because very few of my roleplaying games turn into tactical (read:
wargaming) games with vehicles, etc. The 25mm figures are more detailed,
there are more available, easier to paint with significant detail (these are
_player_ characters -- much loving care).

        Oh, yeah, and I have exclusively 25mm figures already.

        Speed of light depends on wavelength and the material through which
it is travelling (no pun intended). Speed of visible light through concrete
is 0 <G>. However, in a vacuum the speed of light is 2.99793x10^8 m/s

        Mean lunar orbital distance is 384,400km.

        For other planets, perihelion (closest) and aphelion (furthest)
distance in AU

        Mercury          0.307/ 0.467

        One Astronomical Unit is defined as the semi-major axis, or mean
distance, of Earth\'s orbit around the Sun, and is equal to 1.496x10^8 km.

>4.  Is a parsec (if I remember correctly) about 3.26 light years?  If so

        A parsec is the distance at which one Astronomical Unit will subtend
one arc second (1 degree = 60 arcminutes = 3600 arcseconds). Simple trig
works out a distance of 3.26 lightyears.

        As for why it was chosen as the size of a subsector hex -- sounded
scientific, I guess.

        Nope. We meant solar radii. The whole reason the limitation on
thrust plates (WHICH ARE NOT CONTRAGRAVITY, D&*^*&IT! DON\'T CONFUSE THEM)
was another one of those "canon" arguments. Canon says invaders first tried
to capture the system\'s gas giant for refueling. Defenders protected it.

        But the Kuiper Belt, around and beyond Pluto\'s orbit, is a large
repository of comets. Comets=ice=fuel. And a huge belt is impossible to
defend. So if there wasn\'t a reason NOT to refuel there, that\'s where
invaders would refuel. Which isn\'t canon, so there had to be a reason. To
avoid the canon police, we agreed on the "shelf" in Tplate performance,
inside Neptune\'s orbit (IIRC). The canonical research station on Pluto
(which Don changed to Sylea for some reason) had to be supplied via
old-fashioned reaction drives.

Mine apologies...  It would be unfair to minimize your own 
contributions to the look and feel of the Traveller universe.  As we 
have discussed in the past...  Your work on the game is very 
appreciated...  I just felt somebody should leap to the defense of 
the Keith\'s a little bit...

I would have to agree...  They wrote quite a few mean adventures and 
other things as well...  I remember reading an interview with the 
Keith Bros. in Megatraveller Journal 3, in which they used a few 
pseudonyms to write other articles so that it wouldn\'t like JTAS had 
been written by the Keith Brothers, yourself, MM, and Frank 
Chadwick...  How prevalent was that???  Did anybody else (yourself, 
or the other GDW staffers) do much of that???

Actually, judging by the skill list in T4 this is a whole lot less 
true with T4 than others.  A large number of skills default off of 
Social Standing, including some that I might not have expected...

Your points on usefulness of the attribute in personal situations is 
good, but remember the reverse would be true as well.  A guy with an 
upper crust accent, clothes, manner, etc, is going to have an awful 
time finding somebody to sell him that black market PGMP-15 from the 
local mob...

Technically, Foss is the more professional artist. But some of his work is
cold. And some of his ideas (the weapons and vehicles in T4) are just
awful. I *don\'t* want my Traveller to have a 1950s feel to it.

What the Keith brothers brought were stunning ideas with art that was
mostly more than adequate, and often quite good. After the AWFUL art in the
latter TNE releases, I was beginning to wonder if any of the editors at GDW
had any idea how to judge an illustration.

The two artists I\'d LOVE to see back in the fold are Blair Reynolds (what
great work he did with DGP!) and Ken Frank, the best illustrator in the
original TNE book. I find that few of the illustrations in T4 elicit any
excitement or atmosphere. The starships are obviously the best, but some of
the color pieces at least are just recycled (I\'ve seen some on book
covers), and simply don\'t feel like Traveller to me (oooooooh yeah - giant
claws on a ship. What a GREAT idea. Next they\'ll give us Ork Mekboys).

On the other hand, having new ship designs is better than I first thought
(given the fact that we\'re several thousand years into Traveller\'s past),
and I think the black and white starship illustrations have a lot going for
them.

    'body' => 'First of all, I have one BIG gripe.  Whose idea was it to have the potential
for multiple attributes applying to a single skill.  I thought the idea was
to make it easy on new ref\'s.  I understand the reasoning as far as making
the game realistic, but I don\'t think it makes the skill system any more
playable.  I vote for a single attribute for each skill. (I know the voting
is over, but I can still say it.)

Now, I had an idea for the skill problem that folks have mentioned.  I don\'t
like the idea of the soooo powerful attribute either, so I\'ve thought about
it a bit, and we need a method that\'s gonna give us the same base number
when you add skill and attribute.  In the book they say an average character
will have an attribute of 7 and a skill of 2 or 3, yeilding an average
targer number of 9 or 10.

So, the goal is to come up with a target number of 9 or 10 but by making the
skill the "power" behind the number rather than the attribute.  Now, I don\'t
claim to be a whiz at role playing, nor am I a whiz at statistics, but I
have a potential fix.  At least its the potential fix that I\'m gonna use
till I find either a problem with it or I find a better method.

Here\'s the method.  First half the attribute(round up) and double the skill.
Now, for the average person we get an attribute of 4 and a skill of 4 or 6
for a target number of 8 or 10, really close to our 9 or 10 in the book.

The examples from the list, Stef(12/1) and Vanna(9/3) would give target
numbers of 7(Stef) and 11(Vanna) which is more realistic, IMO.  This will,
I\'m sure, upset some of the Traveller canon die-hards, but it does have the
advantage of working. :)

An interesting side-note, is that this could be backwards integrated into
character generation.  Rather than rolling 2D6 for attribute generation,
roll 2D3 (Hey don\'t want those D3 to go to waste!) and whenever the book
allows for a single skill to be gained, allow the character to choose two
skills.  I\'m sure this thought will really perterb some Traveller canon
die-hards as well, but I kinda like it.  :)

Frankly for those of us who are dexterity 3-4 on the ole\' Traveller 
1-15 scale, painting even a 25 mm miniature is a chore...  Besides 
which, just about the whole industry is now geared towards 25mm at 
this point, and I think we do want to be compatible with standards... 
 Gonna be a lot easier to convert players from other systems if they 
don\'t have to toss ALL their miniatures...

It was my understanding that that was precisely what they were going to do. 
Systems near Sylea would be better defined, and as you moved away from the
Syleaian core there would be less and less detail.

That would be fine with me.  Actually, it doesn\'t matter because I\'ll
either use all, some or none of their details anyway.  <g> It\'ll depend on
how their details fit into my campaigns.

>It\'s rather like specifying Canada without the USA:  they are

<Sigh!> Now *why* did you have to make a crack like that?  We were getting
along so well! <g>

Now while it\'s true that many Americans would have trouble pointing to
Canada on a map, most of us *do* know Canada is a different country...just
like Hawaii.  But, you know, it\'s *obvious* that Canada is different, you
know, it\'s COLD up there!  It\'s a big frozen wasteland, sort of like
Alaska, right?  <g>

We know Canadians are different from us, Americans, too.  They speak
*french*, even when they don\'t have to!  And when they *do* speak english
they don\'t say, "you know", like we do, you know?  Instead they say "a"...a
lot.  They\'ve got their own national anthem too, something like "Old
Can-a-da, mumble, mumble, mumble...", at least that\'s what it sounds like
when they sing it.  We know they have these cops in Red jackets and funny
hats called mounties that we suspect talk to their horses, but maybe that\'s
just a joke.  We also *suspect* that there are some women up there, but
don\'t hold us to it.  We know that there are a lot of real smart
Canadians...we know they\'re smart because they move down here to get out of
the cold.  I guess that explains why the ones that stay can\'t get a
football field marked right, eh?  <g>

And finally we know Canadians are different because they *choose* to live
up there! <g>

My requirement for figures (beings) is that they are proportioned.
Except for some of the Mithril Middle Earth figs, I\'m not sure I\'ve
ever seen a fantasy/SF mini that was even close to looking human.

We ended up bashing figures from plastic models in 1:72 and 1:48
scale since they have human proportions (you can sculpt on/over the
original then make a quick mold).

BTW, to any IG types out there, what are the licencing requirements
for T4?  Is there some nasty up-front money, or can it just be a
royalty?  I cast resin for a living, and was thinking of doing some
traveller stuff if the start up costs won\'t kill me.

So my fleet will have a 1g HEPlaR drive and mine the Kuiper belt
anyway.  As you say, it is not possible to defend, so I bypass the
GG.  True I then need to jump in-system, but it\'ll only be a J1, and
I\'ll have at least enough fuel to jump back to the belt.

Eh, the skills are the same (unless that is an errata item), so I figured 
the generically named "military academy" fit better than "naval academy" 
for marines.

But, it probably doesn\'t make much difference, given that the skills are 
the same.

About 10 years ago, there were 4 games shops here in Leeds. One was part 
of a small chain of games shops, one sold mostly wargames and 2nd hand 
stuff, the others sold games in addition to their main business. 

Then GW arrived.

At first, everything was fine: GW sold pretty much the same things as 
the others, at roughly the same prices. 

Then they declared war.

They dropped their prices, sometimes selling at a loss in order to 
undercut the opposition. The wargames shop went mail-order only. One of 
the non-dedicated shops stopped selling games, the other cut the size of 
their games department. The last shop staggered on, then went out of 
business (possibly because of behind-the-scenes dirty tricks). Soon 
after, GW dropped all other products and sold only their own games and 
figures.

There is a slightly happy ending: a few years later, a new games shop 
opened to fill the vacuum (Travelling Man - excellent shop, BTW), and 
seems to Be doing pretty well. Also, the GW shop never seems to have any 
customers in it these days.

That\'s a nice idea.  IG could take a big chunk for their own official 
adventures, and they could set aside other pieces for licensees.  
Everything else would be open for individual referee (ie, unpublished) 
development.

Hey, at the scale of most ship miniatures, you just paint the vanes to

You\'ve been watching the Batman cartton series on TV, haven\'t you? (For
those who haven\'t they have a millionaire who go just a bit *too*
fascinated with Zeus, and had a "lightning cannon" constructed to let
him throw thunderbolts)

This is what I would rather suspect would happen to any vertically 
integrated game company with its own stores...at least if they were 
myopic enough to only carry their own products...even GW\'s stuff 
isn\'t going to be popular forever...even TSR has cranked out its 
share of lemons over the years...

OTOH, I could very easily see a game company buying/operating its own 
shops as a means of getting wider distribution.  First, they\'d need 
to buy distributors though...

	Your wish is my command!

	Actually, it is possible to design a thruster plate which does
not fire mass out of its exhaust like a rocket, and which does operate
the way folks expect it to, and which does not violate the basic
conservation laws of physics ---- but it takes A LOT of energy.

	"Handwaving" physics: The drive emits some kind of field (ie,
massless particles) which carries a momentum, causing the ship to move
in an equal and opposite manner.

	Hard physics: Conservation of energy and momentum requires that
for a ship of mass "M" (measured in kilograms) and acceleration "a"
(measured in meters per second) the power "P" requirement of the drive
(in watts, assuming 100% efficiency) be

	P = c * (Ma)

where "c" is the speed of light (300,000,000 meters per second).

	This means that a scout courier with mass M = ~1,000,000 kg,
and acceleration a = 20 m/s, would require a power plant outputting
6,000,000,000 megawatts. Yow.

	Obviously, this figure can be lowered by cheating ---- let the
power plant drive a small rocket motor which spews mass out the back at
a rate "R" (in kilograms per second). Now the optimal power requirement
becomes:

	P = c * sqrt( (Ma)^2 + (Rc)^2 ) - R * c^2

If you don\'t have a calculator that computes to 20 decimal places, you
can approximate the above equation (in the low-power region) as:

	P = (M * a)^2 / (2 * R)

You can actually get the power requirement down to 500 MW (the CT value)
if you set R = 400,000 kg/s. The only problem is, where do you get the
400 metric tons of ejectile every second that you need to fire out the
back of the rocket? NOW is when handwaving comes in handy!

And that\'s fine, and anticipated by the canon-maintaining "fix" we came up
with on beta -- but it means you\'re wasting space on board your warships
by including limited special-use HEPlaR drives.  And at least HEPlaR is
more visible than thrusters (viz. extended discussions of plasma plumes),
so the defenders have an idea that you\'re coming.

In the US today, marine officers are trained in NROTC programs at

I always used the rules for NROTC and the Naval Academy found in High

I think I\'m going to cancel your vote.  ;-> I like the added
flexiblity, and don\'t think it makes the skill system any *less* playable. 
Maybe I\'m wrong, but I thought you\'d have to choose which attribute to use
during chargen (or when a new skill is learned), right?  So once you
choose, then you\'re back to one attribute per skill.

Of course, the GM is ghod, so if you don\'t like multiple attributes just
outlaw them for your game.  ;->

If we keep the same number of dice for the various difficulties, I agree.

Yes, the expected value of 2d6 is 7, and 2/3\'s of the time the number will
be in the range of 5 to 9.  Historically most skills are in the range of 1
to 4.  So, I\'d say the asset will almost always be in the range of 6 to 13
and cluster around 9 and 10. <g>

This is an interesting idea well worth pursuing. 

It will be better to "bite the bullet" and pull this all the way back into
Chargen.  The attribute adds during Chargen will have to be halved, the
skills earned need to be doubled.  There is going to be an affect on
unskilled rolls..do you half the already halved attribute?  There might be
have to be changes in the number of dice for difficulty levels too.

Changes to consider
Base Attributes: Roll 2d3
Attributes earned during CharGen: cut numbers in half
Skills:  double number of skills earned
Unskilled tasks:  Think about this one!  Do you use full attribute or 1/2
of the already halved attribute?

You can improve both skills and stats.  For skills, if you are awarded an 
experience point (or more) by the referee after an adventure, you can 
roll 1D against your skill level /if you used that skill during the 
just-concluded adventure/.  Roll equal to or greater than your skill 
level, and the skill increases.
If your skill level is higher than 6, you must roll a 6, then roll 
again. (If you don\'t roll a six the first time, then you don\'t advance a 
level in that skill).  If your two rolls are equal to or greater than 
your skill level, it is increased by one.
For improving characteristics, see the section in The Traveller Book.  
It\'s the same in T4. (That is to say, it is a difficult and lengthy process 
for the character.)

Society has changed. Clothing has changed.  Hairstyle has changed.  Thus,
I\'ll grant you the katana and strange armour.  Even the shorter fur (could
have been cut, after all).

Basic physical features haven\'t.  Different body types have been in and out
of fashion, but humans just haven\'t changed that much.  Thus, the muscular
structure and facial features are still off.

Under T4, the attribute to be used with the skill depends on the 
situation.  For example, diagnosing a patient as having a known disease 
would take Medical skill and Education.  Diagnosing a patient as having a 
never-before-discovered disease would take Medical skill and 
Intelligence.  Performing surgery would take Medical skill and Dexterity.

It makes sense to me.  And, it doesn\'t seem that difficult.  So the 
referee has to think about the task being performed before announcing the 
target number; doesn\'t seem like that much of a bother.  And, considering 
the added realism it brings to the game, I think it is a positive change, 
on the whole.

Maybe.  But so would a scuzzy stranger.  In a case like this _local_
connections would be the key factor.  And having the goods on a high-class
toff might be useful to the mob.  

I tend to use social standing a fair amount - but I _do_ use common sense.

Sounds good, Douglas.  Now, who\'s gonna bankroll it?  Oh, I know!  We\'ll 
just add this tagline:

(This message paid for by the Citizens for an Imperial Future.)

That way, we can get around campaign finance reform.  The Imperial Scouts 
("Imperialists" for short) will be the party, and Citizens for an 
Imperial Future will be one of our many contact groups raking in the soft 
dollars (soon to be Imperial Credits) for us. :)

In defense of IG, I\'ll point out that Traveller has regularly changed
elements of the "canon" out from under us (ship design from CT to MT to
TNE to, now, T4; some discrepancies in the chronology, etc.).  Usually
this has appeared to be for the sake of making the game "better", not just
out of sloppiness. 

I\'d certainly not object to "different"-looking Aslan (after all, you need
to give your artists _some_ free rein and not force cardboard cut-outs). 
If the Aslan are "re-designed", it just means some new excitement and
discovery for Milieu 0 (and 200). 

What I _DO_ object to is the blatant "space opera" character of the new
illustrative style -- as I wrote previously, I\'m starting to wonder if
GDW is deliberately playing to a different demographic.

It\'s a real unit. As you can see, it\'s the average distance between the
Earth and the Sun. For various reasons, it\'s *much* easier to determine
distances in the solar system in terms ofAUs than in any sort of
absolute units.

> If so why is this so significant?

"Parsec" comes from the way the figure is determined. Distances to the
nearer stars are measured by using parallax. You measure the position
of the star against the *distant* starts and galaxies. Them you wait
until earth is on the opposite side of its orbit and measure the
position agaim. It\'ll have shifted, due to the slightly different angle
you are looking at it from. The closer the star, the bigger the shift.

For an example of how this works, hold up a finger at arm\'s length,
withg one eye closed. Note where it appears to be against the
background. Now close that eye and open the other. The position will
have shifted.

A parsec is the distance an object would have to be at to show a
parallax of one second of arc. And the value is actually something like
the cotangent of 1 arc-second times one AU.

> Isn\'t this the standard size of a subsector hex?

Yes.

>  If so, why?

They probably figured it was a "good" value. In this part of the
galaxy, the average distance between star systems runs around 5-6 light
years, or about 2 parsecs. Note that this is a good match to the 50%
chance of a star in any given hex. :-)

I just spotted the exact figure in the sci.space FAQ when I was looking
up the "astrological[sic] units".

	1370 W / m^2	 (1400)  -- Solar Constant (intensity at 1 AU)

So that\'s 1.37 kW/m^2. So you get a megawatt for every 730 m^2. That\'s
a circle a bit over 30 meters in diameter. 

I\'d say that\'s important, if only to the extent that if it is ignored,
it\'ll render the living quarters unihabitable rather quickly. :-)

After all, the machinery spaces can run a lot hotter, the equipment
would be designed for it.

Yep. And any ship that is "stealthed" that way is going to have
*severe* problems with heat loading. 

I think that if you have the time, the best way to "sneak" into a
system is to find a likely "dirty snowball" far enough out that your
jump signatature isn\'t likely to be detected, nudge it into a parabolic
(or even hperbolic) orbit that passes somewhere near the target and
then just dig in. You\'ll be just another long period comet.

Actually, the speed of light has been *defined* for 15 or 20 years.

I made a post about it a while back. For "crude" measurements (e.g.
preliminary survey of all stars within a few hundred light years) you
just use a decent sky cam and shoot a full sphere set of plates. Then
you make a one parsec jump and repeat. Better yet, have several ships
jump out a parsec each along all six axes. 

The parallax measuresments over a 1 to 2 parsec *baseline* get kinda easy.

For more accuracy, you set up a system of observatories, and link them
with a laser or maser baseline (you have to wait 6.5 years, but you get
the length of the baseline *very* accurately). Then you compare plates
as before, using time hacks in the link beams to symchronize stuff.

This should give you accuracies far higher than the accuracy to which a
jump can be calculated.

I guess you aren\'t old enough to recall the story in Playboy (back in
the 60s) where someone came up with cheap nukes, and before you knew
it, *everybody* had them. At one point Congress is debating a law to
ban them, and get persuaded not to by the large number of privately

It looks like this idea would work, but you certainly would have to
increase the skills a character earned.

        Well, at the risk of getting flamed, what Traveller calls Skills,
Vampire subdivides into talents, skills, and knowledges.  To give you the
really short version, talents are things that you\'re just naturally good
at, skill requires practice, and knowledges require study.  Talents
includes Brawl, for example, whereas Skills includes firearms, and
knowledges includes Law.

        Maybe Talentish skills in T4 could be weighted more towards
Characteristic, whereas Skillish skills would go more towards Skill?

Oooo, that\'s different from what I thought.

Well, it does to me too, but...

...Paul was right.  It *is* more complicated than a single
attribute.  I must rethink how I was going to organize the character sheet.

I\'ll have to rethink how I was going to handle task generation too. You\'re
right though, it does sound like a positive change.

I just hope it gets here before Christmas! <g>

>Sorry, couldn\'t be helped. :)

Sure it could!  You with, how many copies now..., four, five!  Just have to
rub it in don\'t you? <g>

It\'s not fair, I tell you!  You rich Imperialist Party plutocrates with
your multiple copies, while all of us little people are scratching to find
even one copy and making do with used little black books.  Beware the wrath
of the Fellow Travellers!  Our time *shall come!

I say, Travellers of the world unite!  All we have to gain is our Hardback
T4\'s!  <g>

I am interested in the IRC chat, but could you please use either GMT time or 
give the Local time plus difference from GMT (eg Sydney is +10 hours 
GMT)? Time management allways make my mind explode.

I can help you with campaign finance reform...  We won\'t let them 
know its for a campaign...

I\'ll handle the finances.  Just send the checks to 

Stuart L. Dollar

123 Afulandis money

Make the checks out to "CASH."

That could work.  Too bad the Default Skills don\'t neatly devide this.  
They should...

    'month' => '08',
    'index' => 'au417',
    'body' => 'This is an alternate psi system for Traveller.  It is based on the psychic
powers described in Andre Norton\'s various SF novels, and is an attempt to
systematize this type of psi and to make it a playable as possible.  This
system is in no way compatible with the existing psi rules.  In addition,
no rules for learning psychic powers are included, because when I run
Traveller I let the PCs each have one or two points of Merits.  Merits are
special powers, or advantages.  Mind Touch, 200,000 Cr, having an eidetic
memory or having a computer implant are all examples of 1 point Merits.
PCs can have up to 2 points of Merits (two point Merits are things like
Illusion, extensive cyborg implants, or being very wealthy). Merits work
well to make characters very individual and to make sure one character is
not a psychic prodigy while none of the others have anything to make up
for their lack of psychic powers. 

This system does not use psi points (a mechanic I personally hate)
Instead, all normal abilities are useable at will.  As I see it, any
uncontested use of an psychic ability should be as easy as walking.  This
fits with the books and reduces die rolling. Contested abilities (ie where
the target has a chance to resist) obviously require die rolls.  Some of
the abilities listed below are called strenuous abilities.  These
abilities require a special effort to perform.  These activities can be
performed whenever desired, but: 

1) The psychic must not be otherwise involved in strenuous activity
(including combat) wen attempting to perform them. 

2) When a strenuous psychic power is used the character is very tired. The
character is at half endurance and -1 to all task rolls until the
character has rested for at least 30 minutes.  In addition, no additional
strenuous psychic abilities may be used until after the character has
rested. 

Contested Rolls:  The psychic rolls an opposed task using the average of
Intelligence and Endurance (round up) + the value of the Merit (+1 or or
+2) vs the subjects average of Intelligence and Endurance (round up).  The
subject also add the Merit value of any psychic powers possessed.  Like
all other default rolls, if the subject is not a psychic the average of
their Int and End is halved.  So a psychic with an Int of 8 and End of 5
with the +1 Merit Mindtouch would roll 7+1 = 8 + 1D6.  If the subject of
their psychic endeavor was a non-psychic with the same Int and End (8 and
5) the subject would roll (7/2) = 4 + 1d6.  Clearly the subject is likely
to loose. 

Mindtouch (+1 Merit):

The most basic psychic power is Mindtouch.  Mindtouch consists of the
ability to send and receive thoughts, images and emotions.  Every psychic
possesses Mindtouch.  Two psychics can communicate much more rapidly and
in greater detail using Mindtouch than they could with speech.  If two
psychics know each other well they can also use Mindtouch to communicate
over long distances (up to Continental Range [5000 km]. Mindtouch works
regardless of linguistic or even species barriers. 

However, it is only possible to use Mindtouch to communicate with another
psychic.  Non-psychics simply can\'t receive thoughts. Psychics can use
Mindtouch to scan non-psychics.  Scanning allows the psychic to determine
the approximate distance, direction, and level of sentience of any mind
within Very Long range [5 km].  Each mind must be scanned one at a time.
Sentients and animals larger than insects will all be detected, though the
psychic can choose to only look for sentient (or non-sentient) minds.
Mindtouch will also allow a psychic to determine if any of these minds are
psychic. 

If the psychic desires a single, individual mind can then be scanned.
Scanning an individual allows the psychic to determine the individuals
basic emotional state and to catch vague glimpses (the GM can be as vague
and enigmatic as desired as long as some truthful inf. is given) of the
thoughts at the from of the individuals mind.  For non- sentients scanning
will reveal only such basic information as <Hungry> or <cold, tired,
afraid>.  Ordinary Mindtouch cannot be used to pull a person\'s computer
password from their mind, but it can be very useful in determining
motivation and in getting useful hints. All forms of scanning require some
concentration and cannot be done while performing any strenuous activity
or when concentrating on other tasks. However, communication between two
psychics is as easy as talking. Neither communication nor scanning are
strenuous activities. 

Strenuous uses of Mindtouch:

Suggestion:

Mindtouch can be used to implant a suggestion in a non-psychic\'s mind. The
idea will be believed unless it is obviously nonsensical or ridiculous,
but it does not have coercive force.  A guard might believe a suggestion
that their leader already knows the psychic and it is OK to let them
through the check-point, but the guard would ignore a suggestion to commit
suicide or to attack their leader.  Suggestions appear as thoughts,
memories and ideas in the head of the subject and are treated as if they
were normal thoughts, ideas, or memories.  Suggestions must be made to a
single perceptible target, so a psychic may only give a suggestion to one
subject at a time.  This is a contested roll. 

Probe:

The psychic can probe for a single piece of information which is well-
known to the subject and which lies close to the surface of the subject\'s
thoughts.  The probe must be phrased by the player as a specific question,
like "What is their computer password" and the answer will contain only
the desired information.  If the subject to not know the answer to the
question the probe will reveal this information too.  Probing is a
contested roll if used against another psychic. 

Illusion (+2 Merit)

Illusion includes all of the abilities listed under Mindtouch.  In
addition, the psychic can create realistic sensory illusions.  These
illusions are mental and physical in nature so they cover all five sense,
including touch.  However, they are in no way real or solid.  If, for some
reason a subject tries to press on or try to reach through an illusion,
the illusion will vanish. Someone shaking the hand of a human disguised as
a Vargr would feel fur, but an illusionary knife would do no damage, and
an illusionary wall would not impede movement (if someone actually tried
to walk through the wall). 

Creating an illusionary disguise for a single willing individual or for an
object no larger than a motorcycle is a non-strenuous task.  The disguise
must conform to the rough contours of the subject of the illusion.  A
human could be disguised as an Aslan, but not as a Hiver or a K\'Kree. 
Illusions work on all non-psychics who view them, an will also fool
cameras and other sensors which do not actually physically contract the
subject of the illusion.  When a psychic perceives and illusion make a
difficult perception roll. if the roll succeeds the psychic is aware of
the illusion and can see through it at will.  Illusions last as long as
the psychic is thinking about them (this does not mean concentrating on
them).  Illusions vanish during sleep, or if the psychic becomes involved
in highly demanding or strenuous activity like combat. 

Strenuous Illusions:

Making a single target invisible for  5 minutes.

Disguising a group of up to 7 individuals or objects (once again this
illusion will last until the psychic stops thinking about it). 

Creating a large illusion like a wall in a corridor, or a different
registry number and color scheme on a ship. 

Place an illusion on a unwilling or unsuspecting living target (making
someone suddenly look and feel old and withered can be a very effective
distraction).  This is a contested roll. 

No psychic can maintain more than one illusion at a time. 

Physical Psychic (+2 Merit)

Physical Psychic includes all of the abilities listed under Mindtouch. In
addition, physical psychics can probe for psychic residues in objects.
This ability is called psychometry.  Suing psychometry on an object will
replay images of the object in use, and the emotions of those holding it. 
Scenes with significant emotional content will be the most vivid.  Highly
detailed information is not usually available, but a psychic could run
their hand over the surface of a box, and if they were looking for a
secret compartment they might well receive the impression of hands
pressing two designs in sequence to open the concealed latch. 

Also, while it would be obvious that a knife had been used as a murder
weapon, and likely that the murder had happened outdoors at night, the
identity of the murderer or the victim might not be revealed and the
psychic might be left with clues like the murderer was very angry at the
victim and held the knife in his large, scared left hand.  psychometry is
a non-strenuous activity. 

Strenuous uses of Physical Psychic powers:

Erase or change the psychic impressions of an object

Move a single small (under 2 kg) object.  The psychic must either be able
to clearly perceive the object, or must have used psychometry on it before
and know exactly where it is. A visible object can be no further than 5
meters away, and a known object must be within 50 meters. 

The object can moved slowly, as if dragged by an unseen hand. It can move
through space, but once again, slowly, at a speed no faster than 5 km/hour
(human walking speed).  The psychic can aim and fire a weapon like a gun
once using this ability, but cannot use a weapon like a knife to do
anything more damaging than slowly cutting bonds.  Moving the object
demands intense concentration and the psychic can perform no other tasks,
including talking, while doing so.

There\'s more space wasted in the freshers for magazine storage.  The

I just wanted to clearify a few things...


***** Task System *****

The task system was set up so that someone with a natural apptitude could
perform a SINGLE action almost as well (or sometimes better) than a
professional.

Example: Bob has a Dex of 9 and Pistol-2.  Dirk has a Dex-7 and a pistol-4.
Taking a singel shot Bob (with natural ability) can shoot as good as Dirk
(the pro).

Now if we all read the rules we will find that when a character performs
multapul actions in a round attributes are devided by the number of actions
(round down). This is where we determin the pros from the naturaly gifted.

Example: Taking three shots, Bob has to make three rolls at 4 or less
(11=F73=3D3, rounded down, +1 for his skill).  Dirk may take three shots at =
7
or less (7=F73=3D2, rounded down, +5 for his skill).

This rule can be applied to all skills.  Professional, however, can do
multaple things at once!

***** 1/2 D6 *****

If you cannot buy a half D6, use the folloing meathod.  Get a differant
color D6 and roll.

1-2 =3D 1
3-4 =3D 2
5-6 =3D 3

***** Critical Hits/Failures  *****

To make a critical Hit one must roll 1\'s on all dice rolled, however, to
roll a critical Failure all you have to roll is two 6\'s.  Therefore, as
difficult goes up your chance of Critically hits goes down while chance of
Critical Failure goes up.

***** Aslian Sketch  *****
=46rom time to time we will be posting things just to get a reaction.  A tes=
t
one might say.  just because you see something, its not cannon until it is
in print, and then again we might change that later if Marc so wishes.

No, no, I\'d much prefer 25mm, but them my eyes are aging.  I\'m already
looking for a stereo-microscope (about 40x; you\'ll remember them from high
school biology class) to help me see what I\'m painting, and regularly use a
fixed-mount magnifying glass (only about 10x) for that purpose.

My personal life aside, however, 25mm makes more sense for the games I tend
to run.  If there\'s combat requiring miniatures, it\'s usually among fewer
than ten figures, in a diarama setting.  I usually make the vehicles out of
cardstock.  Sometimes I use HO scale plastic figures and vehicles, but 25mm
lead figures are still easier to identify (and I haven\'t found any plastic
figures in battle dress -- the only ones in vacc suits are Airfix\'s Apollo
mission set).  Larger battles tend to get played with Azhanti High Lightning
or even Striker, using counters instead of miniatures, and a map instead of
a big diarama.

(I hope they do), it would probably be a large boxed affair somewhere in the $35 price 
range.  For that kind of money, I\'d prefer 25mm.  

One last thing, I agree completely with Merrick Burkhardt\'s statement about well 
proportioned figures.  No one makes figures better than Mithril.  Hmmm, maybe they could 
produce a Traveller line?

Ah, okay.  So, my sensor ops guy can detect two, three, four, or even 
more ships if he has enough skill and gets lucky - while a person with 
high attribute and low skill hasn\'t nearly as much of a chance.
Makes sense.  Thanks for clearing that up!

It\'s just such a different way of looking at things than what I am used 
to that I probably won\'t understand all the implications until I\'ve 
played the game extensively.  I was thinking of multiple actions as if 
they only related to making attacks.

BTW, it would be helpful if this were noted in the Tasks section next 
printing, rather than (or in additon to) in the Ground Combat section.
Although the Multiple Tasks rule in Ground Combat /does/ say that a 
character can perform any task (not just firing a gun, in other words) 
during a single combat round, this is not mentioned again in Space 
Combat.  Some of us (Me!  I do!) need to have such key rules shoved in our 
faces before we take notice of them. :)

[Side Note:  Good Lord, I\'m just not used to learning a new RPG system 
after all of these years.  Even though T4 is pretty close to being CT, 
the differences keep tripping me up.  Every time I assume something is 
so, it turns out not to be.  I\'ve got to get it through my head that this 
is a NEW game, not CT.]
[It would be interesting to hear from those who are completely new to 
Traveller - are they picking this stuff up right away?  Is it just all 
the Traveller "baggage" I\'m carrying with me that is impeding my full 
understanding of the new system?]

I like thinking about what the "common Traveller" is going to experience 
in year 0.  The idea of honor being so important...it is one I like, and 
one I wish were prevalent right now all over the world.  

Let\'s see...there are still dishonorable people, there always will be 
(Rogues, Pirates, etc.).  But, if honor is still something to be relied 
upon, it must be pretty common.  There must not be much risk of running 
into a dishonorable person - else no one would trust anyone they didn\'t 
know very well, and the whole flavor of the game becomes like it is in 
Year 1100.  

So, Rogues and such are uncommon.  And, they might be easily recognizable 
in some way - some sort of "dishonorable persons" list distributed by 
TNS?  Hmmm.

One way to keep the number of dishonorable persons to a minimum is, of 
course, the use of ritual combat.  I\'m glad T4 uses this method.  If you 
lie and get caught, the one you lied to can challenge you to a duel.  
Rogues will have to be careful of who they cross - it better be someone 
who is less skilled than they are! :)

So, the Rogues that survive will tend to be strong, cunning, fast, highly 
skilled - Darwinian natural selection applied to the scum of the universe!

But, back to how the average Traveller lives.  He lives in a polite 
society, if he is of middle class or above (do the lower classes consider 
honor to be of importance?  Perhaps...perhaps as much as, or more than, 
the upper classes do!  Sticking together, helping eachother over rough 
spots...).  Brashness is probably greeted with freezing contempt.  

Is it an egalitarian society?  Or are there severe differences between what 
is expected of (and allowed to) each gender?  

What about aliens?  Are they treated well as equals by this 
human-dominated society?  The existance of the Staple Gun might be a clue 
in this...

Can a Traveller use his word as his I.O.U.?  Can a Traveller arrive at a 
starport creditless, and still get a place to stay for the night on the 
strength of his word that he will repay the favor at a later date?  What 
about meals?

Hmmm.  This bears more thought.  I can\'t wait to see what others think 
of, though!

    'body' => 'Greetings;

I have been following the Traveller Digest for a few weeks and have decided
to join the full mailing list.

My travelling goes back to the orginal three book set in \'79, though I got
them second hand. I did not get into MT; but I did pick up the TNE. I have a
fascination for designing things, so FF&S, like the Trillion Credit
Squadron, the orginal Striker equipment design book, and High Guard, has
been getting the most wear. 

I am not inclined to rapid responses, so I may be a little late on some of
the recent topics. I am still cogitating on the Fighters discussion, but I
have formulated my take on the Imperial establishing document. The
perception that I have long held was that the Sylean Federation was in many
ways more like the current UN than anything else. It functioned great with a
small, monolithic group of countries. Expansion has brought too many
divisive cultural and politcial conflicts. The military is actually
comprised of \'loaned\' units form the various member worlds, resulting in a
wide variation in troop quality and quantity, incompatable equipment and
contradictory lines of command. Each world is biasing trade rules to help
their freinds and disrupt their enemies. For all the great press the
Federation gives itself, most of the actions the Federation takes are mostly
after the fact confirmations of local military actions (re: Bosnia). It is
in this light that Cleon issues the following statement:


Civilization is sliding back towards The Long Night.  Our Federation has
seen many new members, hungry for peace and prosperity, but such goals seem
now further away. We have seen piracy grow; we have watched trade slow. We
have seen the Council bog down in endless dispute and debate while
conditions worsen. I have worked hard for the Federation, committing  my
industires, businesses and wealth to the future, only to be faced, in the
final analysis, that the Federation is following the Ramshackle Empire
instead of the Grand Imperium of Stars. As descendant of Emperors and heir
to the Iridium Throne, I must, my ancestors demand it of me, take
responsibility and action, to reclaim the Iridium throne. 

I call upon the Nobles to live up to their ancestral duties. I call them to
be Representatives of the Iridum Throne to their worlds, and to be Advocates
of their worlds before the Iridium Thone.  I call upon the Nobles  to
assemble with me to plan and implement a medium of exchange that will
simplify and expand interstellar commerce. I call upon the Nobles to
assemble with me to plan and implement a military organization to secure our
borders, to suppress  piracy, and to ensure domestic peace, that each world
may be safe, secure and prosperous.  I call upon the Nobles to meet with me
in the future at intervals, that the needs of Civilization may be made known
and action take to satisfy those needs.

We must act, or we must endure the curses of our descendants from the
blackness of a new Long Night. 


The view of the Noblitiy that Cleon has is different from how the Nobles
1100 years later view themselves. Here the nobles are placed into a unique
position, being both the representatives of the Emperor to the world
containing their fief and the advocates of that same world before the
Emperor. By doing this, Cleon implicitly makes the nobles the head of the
local Imperial political machinery. Cleon also establishes a consistent long
term long presences that can be neutral in local disputes. Local governement
can change every third tuesday if it wants to; the interface to the
Imperium, the local noble, is fixed and stable. I have never taken the
social standing of a PC to mean their personal standing, but that of their
family. A social standing of Baron may mean that Great Uncle Matt is a
baron, not the PC. Cleon\'s action can also create some interesting local
politics. Example: after several years of effort, Adolf, a charismatic
dictator has managed to take contol of Deutschine. He can do as he wants.
Whoops; no, there is Baron Bonhoffer, watching out for the Imperium\'s
interests (taxes, stable trade, general peace). Adolf can not <openly> touch
the Baron, who holds the title by will of the Emperor. Adolf can not
<openly> interfere with the Imperial machinery, the Baron heads that. Lots
of ways to go from here. 

Cleon, a good business person, next plans to establish a standardized
currency to help trade. I do not think the Federation had an independent
currency, resulting in very unstable pricing of goods and services as more
and more worlds, of differing tech levels joined. A stable government needs
a stable currency (re: Russia).

Cleon\'s statement leaves the military last and defines it in terms of the
security of all the worlds. As I said before, I picture the Sylean
Federation to be much like the UN. Sylean Security Forces, like UN
peacekeepers, are assembled as needed from member worlds, with diverse
training, equipment and often conflicting orders from home governments and
Federation leaders. Using the same indirection that many member worlds had
used, pointing one way while moving troops another, by summoning the NOBLES
to develop the military, he is trying to sidestep transient local politics. 

The last call he makes is to have the Nobles continue to meet "at intervals"
to discuss the state of Civilisation, which he has equated to the Empire. He
does not provide an exact interval, but leaves that open. He has setup the
Moot, and provides the nobles a sense of participating the overall running
of the Imperium. 

The Emperors and the Nobility changed, across 1100 years, leading to the
final collapse of the Civil War.

Cleon would not have succeeded just on nostalgia alone. 

Hitler became German Prime Minister because of the economic and social
collapse that followed World War I. He was able to manuver multiple
fragmented special interest groups around due to the economic, social and
political fears of the time. Musolini did the same in Italy. Mao succeeded
in China because he had a consistent steady approach for government instead
of fragmented warlords.

To really define the Imperial Establishing Document, we need to really get
into the social, political and economic structures of the Sylean Federation
and how they failed. 

Now, how does this fit with your image of the early days of the Imperium?

The problem is that multiple actions are usually only performed during

you get into the realm where being more skilled doesn\'t help you as much

That\'s how CT started out. But by the time they came up with the
"freebie" map of the known galaxy, they\'d managed to wind up with the
Imperium completely surrounded by either their own products, or
"licensed" ones.

I\'d say that the IG sectors should form a sort of sprawling web. The
licenced sectors could attach to this, but with "free" sectors
in-between. That way there would *always* be "free" sectors adjacent to
official ones. 

Manipulate stellar placement a bit so the the "backbone" has lots of
shorter jump routes along it, that gives an excuse for the main thrust
of exploration to go that way. The "free sectors may have nice chains
of jump routes, but there may be a single longer jump seperating them
from the "mainstream" areas. But that\'s all it takes. Lok at any town
that gets bypassed by the Interstate. :-)

The heck with using it that way. If you can interconvert energy and
momentum that way, do it like this:

Rig up a scaled down mass driver that gives a metal slug a momentum of
1 kg m/s towards the stern. This gives the ship a momentum of 1 kg m/s
in the opposite direction. Now convert the momentum of the slug into
energy according to the stress energy tensor, E = p*c. So

	E = 1 * 3e8

So we get 300 megajoules of energy from destroying that momentum. Who
needs fusion? 

It gets even worse when you look at the stress energy tensor term for
angular momentum. One unit of atomic spin is equivalent to either 6.5
kg m/s of momentum, 22 micrograms of mass or 2 gigajoules.

I don\'t recall seeing them before. I got my figures above from one of
Dr. Forward\'s articles. I\'d just as soon *not* see energy/momentum/spin
conversions available in Traveller, as it makes the amount of energy
available something that is simply mind-boggling.

Does anyone know where else I can upload Traveller files?  I have:

- - several deckplans in 25mm scale

Not so!  The Oort Cloud, I\'d guess, is no more than a light-day out, if
that.  If you\'re refuelling there for a jump to the inner system, and
emitting drive plumes, I ought to have six day\'s notice at least.  :-)

        Howdy Ken! I\'ll be happy to discuss Year 0 (Getting ideas to use in
the Year 0 Mileau Book? :) ) as I\'ve been doing a lot of thinking about that
lately. I\'ve been re-reading Clayton Bush\'s excellent article "A Concise
History of the Third Imperium" from TRAVELLER\'S DIGEST # 18. I get the
impression that the switch from the Sylean Federation to the Third Imperium
wasn\'t an overnight thing; people didn\'t go to bed on the last day of year
651 SF and wake up Imperial citizens on 001-0. Cleon must have had this in
mind from the very beginning. I seriously doubt that Cleon was just this
humanitarian guy who wanted to restore interstellar culture and all that.
Personal Power could have been a motive, maybe greed. Maybe Cleon was one of
those who lived in the past, so to speak, and wanted to restore the glory of
his ancestors.
>From all accounts, he was certainly ruthless in many respects in the way he
went about consolidating his power. I\'m sure there were a few enemies who
were silenced in one way or another.
        The thing that intrigues me is what did the average citizen think of
all this? There were undoubtably those who opposed Imperialization (is that
a word?), and many probably felt "Things are going fine as is-why mess with
it"? What happened to those with opposing viewpoints? (This may come up in
my campaign, as my wife, who has a Master\'s degree in History, doesn\'t like
the Imperium because it\'s so "imperialistic". I\'m sure her character will
follow a similar path.)
        Still, this is going to be an exciting time to adventure in. The
Imperium is, what, about 30 star systems at this point? A LONG way to go to
get to where it will be. My characters are going to be explorers helping to
expand that frontier. I\'m really looking forward to this.

Cold, very cold. Freezing cold. Near absolute zero cold. It would rapidly
vaporize of course. I would imaging the sound (for the few seconds one
would be alive) would be that of rapidly escaping gas but much much
louder, a roaring/rushing sound.

Well, at the least it would seriously shorten the 1 year duration of
fusion reactors. (see below for worse cases)

Only the fact that hydrogen is very, very volatile and the most likely
outcoume of such a massive internal leak would be a *massive* expolsion,
potentially destroying the ship.

    'body' => 'So, about this whole 15mm vs 25mm thing:

Is it overly greedy on my part to want BOTH?  I use 25mm for roleplay; its 
easier to identify with and relate to a 25mm figure as a representation of your 
character; more detail, easier to see (and lets face it; I\'m too damned old to 
paint tiny details on 15mm figures).  On the other hand, I am proud and pleased 
to admit that I do a lot of combat in my games, and sometimes this gets large 
and complex enough to be a Striker/wargame situation.  That\'s when I want the 
15mm stuff.  Fortunately, I have some of the old Martian Metals minis, and a 
lot of "standard" 15mm wargaming minis (mostly W.W.I Germans, Brits and French, 
with some civil war, Roman Empire, Vikings and American indians thrown in for 
fun.  

What I want are a good line of 25mm _characters_, with a few sets of standard 
NPCs and a squad or two of marines.  Basically, look to the careers in the T4 
book as your figure archetypes; I\'d like two male and two female examples of 
each career as a starter.  For NPCs, a few 3 or 4 figure packs focused on 
specific roles would be good; a pack of Navy crew, a pack of Navy officers, a 
pack of Merchant crew, a pack of Mercenaries, a pack of Government Officials, a 
pack of Marines in Battledress, a pack of Marines in fatigues, a pack of 
Starport Tavern Thugs (come on, everybody uses these!), a pack of Typical TL12 
Civilians, and a pack of Belters (of course).  With the 6 4-packs of character 
figures, and the 10 packs of NPC figures, you would have most all of your 
normal needs met.  Add to that four different sets of Aliens, and you have a 
basic 20-pack assortment of Traveller figures to please one and all.  Add to 
that a nice resin-cast Air Raft and G-Carrier, and life would be good indeed.

What I _do not_ want is a pile of oversculpted, overarmed, overarmored, 
OVERPRICED Games Workshop crap.  I have asked people at several mini companies 
about SciFi miniatures, but they all seem to think that the Games Workshop 
archetype is what everyone wants.  I\'m sure there is a good market for it, but 
there are plenty of people that don\'t want Space Orkz or similarly concepted 
pre-teen fantasies.

As for 15mm, I would like a pack of characters (smaller versions of the 24 
character figures above), a pack of Marines in fatigues, a pack of Marines in 
Battledress, a pack of Mercenaries, and a pack of Aslan Mercs.  That\'s five 
different sets; more could easily be dreamed up later.  Some 15mm vehciles 
would be good also; again, resin is cheaper and easier to cart around.

Unfortunately, I realize this probably won\'t happen.  But I would like to dream 
about it.

Thanks for the clarification, Ken.  I now see somewhat the importance of
this, but for the example we have been using, the Survey skill, I don\'t know
how important multiple actions are.  I understand the useage (and honestly,
I had forgotten when I posted my fix) for the combat setting, and I would
agree, but the problem IMO is really with the non-combat skills.

First I must say it is nice to see a firm that produced a game so closely

The main point of this email/message is that i was wondering on the net 
is there anywhere to find Traveller adventures - for any version, T4 
would be nice, but at the moment I seem to be able to find all sorts of 
links, ship designs, gear, whatever, but the actual sites with full 
adventures are far and few between.

I am hoping that someone may be able to point out the errors of my ways 
and lead me to some good sites.  The best I have found so far are :
The Imperium Games Site (Obviously)
Travellers Aid Society
Traveller Chronicle.

Steve,

You\'ve covered a lot there, but since we\'re dreaming anyway, I\'d add:

- - a complete set of bar room figures (bar, tables, bartender, 2 servers)
- - a TAS set! Go whole hog!  Do the typical TAS office (a few desks, a 
  reception desk, some clerks, some bedroom acouterments for those freebie 
  overnight stays, some terminals, etc.) - this could be used for LOTS
  of other situations - not just TAS offices - but calling it that would
  be nice for sales, and unity of the Traveller line.
- - An Imperial Court Set!  Nobles, throne, the whole bit.  Again, this would
  be useful for other settings as well - any time you need a majestic court
  scene.

I could go on and on.  The gist is, I want diorama type stuff.  I got a 
lot of use out of the Fantasy setting bars, kegs, beds, etc.  Why not have 
similar sets for our favorite Sci Fi game?

When it comes down to it, it probably won\'t happen.  But, if Marc\'s 
dreams for Traveller come true, it could.  If it gets to be on the level 
of Star Wars and Star Trek, there would be enough money in the market for 
companies to do such things.

Here\'s hoping.

Insufficient data!  <g> What are you using for fuel?  Are you using
hydrogen to power a hot fusion plant?  Are you using water to fuel a cold
fusion plant?  Is the fuel under pressure and how much?

If it\'s hydrogen then it might be cryogenic, or it might be
preheated.  Either way if you vent a lot H2 into an O2 rich
atmosphere you\'ll get fire and explosion.  A small, slow leak would be
detected, if your equipment was working correctly, and could be dealt with,
of course if you didn\'t detect the leak you\'d soon have an explosive
situation.  The effects of a smaller leak under a lot of pressure would
*start* as a jet of almost invisible flame across the room, but soon the
ship goes boom.

On my ships the fuel of choice is water, but your engineers won\'t be
drowning.  <g> The water is also used as coolant and reaction mass.  Water
is already very hot when it enters the engine room.  It runs through
several cycles around the engine room becoming:  steam, live steam, and
eventually plasma.  The effects of a fuel leak depend on where in the
process it takes place.  It could be a stream of scalding water, but that\'s
not as dangerous as if the leak occurs later in the process.  A small leak
could result in a jet of almost invisible steam (or plasma) lancing across
the room.  A large rupture would cause an explosion and basically parboil
anybody in the engine room.  Not much different from hydrogen in the end,
but a little more forgiving...perhaps. <g>

>2. What effect might the sudden loss of fuel flow be on the power plant?

Insufficient data!  <g> It depends on what kind of power plant you are
using and how it was designed.  The lose of fuel flow *should* cause the
plant to shutdown gracefully.  It\'s the lose of coolant that will really
get you!  If the component parts run hot (and they probably do) then losing
coolant will do anything from cracking to slagging them down.  OTOH, a
starship\'s power plant should have been built with redundant automatic and
manual safety systems, designed to survive most accidents.

>3. Anything spectacular or important I should consider in this "accident?"

Think Challenger.  A big engine room explosion *could* blow a ship apart. 
Even a smaller explosion would be devastating and felt though out the ship. 
Minor leaks or explosions could still be deadly *in* Engineering and are
likely to be *felt* throughout the entire ship.

>Senario:  

The ship suddenly shudders and lurches throwing everyone to the deck. The
lights on the Bridge flicker and come back dimly as the backup systems kick
in.  The boards around the control room are covered with flashing red
lights.  Bleeding from a gash on his head Byner turns to you and says...

Another nice thing about 15mm, it\'s near 1:72 scale.  With 1:72
minis, you have *tons* of models to bash into vehicles, etc. if you
so desire.  A guy we game with used a SW Star Destroyer model to
make a Type S in 1:72.  Neat-o.  The top lifts off to see the halls
inside :-)

Those Micro Machines SW figures are pretty well proportioned, too.

I don\'t suppose you did them with a cross-platform tool?  Something that
creates source generic enough to port over to the more common
DOS/Win/OS2/*nix systems?

Pretty soon Mac, OS/2, Windows and *nix systems will all be able to run the
same Java programs from the desktop and over the net.  I think it\'s likely
to become the BASIC of the 90\'s.  

Personally, I *like* Pascal better (I use Sybil and Delphi much more than
C++ <g>) than the C like Java, but I really think Java is the wave of the
future.

Multiple actions per turn!  

I\'m sort of slow, can we go through a couple of examples?

Bob\'s                       Single
Skills      Attrib  Skill   Asset
==================================
Pistol (DEX)   9      2      11
Survey (EDU)   9      1      10

Dirk\'s                      Single
Skills      Attrib  Skill   Asset
==================================
Pistol (DEX)   7      4      11
Survey (EDU)   6      4      10


If Bob and Dirk perform ONE action using either skill they have an
equal chance of success or failure.  11=11 and 10=10

If Bob and Dirk perform TWO actions using Pistol in one turn...

Bob     9/2,dn = 4 + 2 = 6
Dirk    7/2,dn = 3 + 4 = 7    Dirk has a 1 point advantage, right?

...or TWO actions using Survey in one turn...

Bob     9/2,dn = 4 + 1 = 5
Dirk    6/2,dn = 3 + 4 = 7   Dirk has a 2 point advantage, right?

With THREE actions...

for Pistol...
Bob     9/3,dn = 3 + 2 = 5
Dirk    7/3,dn = 2 + 4 = 6 

for Survey...
Bob     9/3,dn = 3 + 1 = 4
Dirk    6/3,dn = 2 + 4 = 6

Am I understanding this correctly?  The characteristic is divided by
the number of actions attempted (rounded down) and the result is
added to the skill.  Therefore you *always* roll against your full
skill plus some fraction of the controlling attribute.

Next question. If Bob wants to perform ONE pistol and ONE something
else during one turn then you divide his controlling characteristic
for Pistol by 2 and add his skill; and you divide his controlling
characteristic for something-else by 2 and add his skill for that,
right?

I want to hear what Ken and crew have to say about these objections, but I
think Joe is on the right track.  I suspect we are, I know *I* am, guilty
of using pretty broad tasks.  With a *broad* task there isn\'t a reason for
multiple tasks..."Fixing the Radio" is the whole task.

What if we break the task down into smaller chunks?  We are
attempting to "Fix the Radio", and let\'s say that is really 4
sub-tasks:  dianosising the problem, tearing the device down,
applying the fix, putting the device back together.  If we take 4 turns
then we get to use *all* of our Asset on each part, but if we are in a
hurry and try to do it all in one turn then we have to complete each part
with our Skill + (.25*Attribute).

Is this a fair representation of the rule\'s intent?

   The aformentioned BOOM might have a more immediate effect, but the
power plant should taper off rather than suddenly stop. Safeties would
probably take over and shut down the reactor quietly whle batteries/aux
power take over.

My LORD you\'ve just described the perfect world! IS ANYBODY AT IG LISTENING?

The Future Warriors line\'s been pretty good tp me for generic 25mm
Travellers. But surely some 15mm producer could license Traveller, which
could be used for generic 15mm for other systems.

I want very much to hear the Official Response from Ken, but here\'s my 
take on it:

In combat, no matter what tasks are involved, those with high skill are 
going to be able to do more than those with low skill....thus potentially 
saving the day by pushing themselves.  Outside of combat, those with 
lower skill but higher characteristics are going to do just as well with 
tasks...they can take the time they need, so they have a good chance of 
success.

So, when it really matters, you want a highly skilled person.  Otherwise, 
it doesn\'t matter too much - all that matters is the sum of char+skill, 
not the individual values.

This should also be useful in other, non-combat situations: using 
Diplomacy or Fast talk on a group of people, for instance.  

In the Survey example, if one follows Eris\' suggestion and breaks the 
task down into sub-tasks - perhaps one for each of the UPP values - and 
there is a time constraint of some sort, then the person with high Survey 
skill will carry the day.

To me, this seems reasonable.  It may not be perfectly realistic, but it 
is as close as I care for it to be.

As Eris said, it is a different way of doing things for many (most?) of 
us, but it /is/ more realistic.  In the Survey example, the character 
could, for instance, get everything right except for the Hydrographics by 
succeeding in all rolls but that one (of course, this would also be a 
good place to use the Uncertain Tasks rule, IMO).  This seems more 
realistic than treating it as one big task.

That\'s right.  The constraint is that you can never do so many tasks that 
the controlling characteristic, when divided by the number of tasks, 
becomes less than 1.  So, a Str. 7 person could do up to 7 brawling 
attacks in a combat round.

The book doesn\'t say either way.  The example uses only one type of skill 
(Brawling).  I don\'t see any reason why not, though.  The skill with the 
lesser controlling characteristic would determine the limit to the number 
of tasks possible at once.  And, of course, it would be up to the 
referee\'s common sense whether the simultaneous tasks would be possible.  
Other than that, I can\'t see any reason for what you say to be false.

Bad idea.

Not only has the precedent been set for 25mm figures with the classic
Grenadier figs (I have a few hundred!) and the TNE figs, but there are
dozens of other companies producing fantastic 25mm figures for other
sci-fi games that are completely compatible with Traveller. 

One that specifically comes to mind is Geohex\'s Star Grunts. They have a
wonderful line of troops and futuristic military vehicles that work
great with Trav. It\'d be a shame to cut out all the compatibles.

IG cannot possibly produce enough molds to meet all the variation
required. Stick with compatibility, not the obscure 15mm figs.

Real, honest-to-goodness feedback from the company!  You gotta _love_

Thanks, Ken!
 
> ***** Task System *****

[snippage]
That part was fairly clear.  The problem is, this only seems to work
when there is a time constraint.  IMHO there are some things that the
less skilled person will never do as well as the more skilled, no matter
how high the natural aptitude or how much time is available.  Of course,
this would be quite complex to include in the game system.

I\'m playing around with a potential easy fix.  Basically, divide the
attribute by 2 and round up while dropping 1D from the dice code for
each difficulty level.

I figure the average stat is 2D, while the average \'professional\' level
skill is about 3-4, or 1D.  This gives a 2-to-1 weighting of attribute
vs skill.  By dividing the atribute by 2, it gets a value of 1D, about
equal in weighting to skill.  The 1D lost by halving the attribute is
simply removed from the number of dice rolled for the task.

I need to work out actual numbers for this, and I\'ll post when I get
something.

Feedback is, of course, welcome.

A jet of liquid hydrogen, suddenly released from pressure?  You probably
wouldn\'t see the hydrogen itself, as there would be a lot of condensation
(water, gasses) around it.  L-Hyd is cold, plus you have expansion cooling as
well.  When the jet hits things you will get thermal damage.  Lots of
crackling and hissing.  Then the l_Hyd evaporates.  Now you have hydrogen and
oxygen (admittedly cold).  A spark or hot surface and they combine into
water, plus lots of light, sound, and heat. 

>2. What effect might the sudden loss of fuel flow be on the power plant?

Assuming that the L-Hyd was being used for cooling (mentioned in SOM, I
think), you could have interesting thermal problems.  Erratic/no flow could
also really screw with some valving.

>3. Anything spectacular or important I should consider in this "accident?"

Well, I don\'t know about you, but _I\'d_ want to be a long way away when it
happened, and even farther when the players found out that I caused it :-)

I wish I had your task.  Even in an emergency I\'m usually trying to do more
than on thing at once. 

This could make for some great role-playing!  Picture your
high-attribute/low-skilled engineer trying to do maintenance.  The referee
rules that interruptions could like multiple tasks (because you have to deal
with them).  Pretty soon this character has a reputation for being _really_
grumpy:

"How much longer to fix the jump drive?  Ten minutes if you leave me alone. 
FIVE BLOODY HOURS IF YOU KEEP ASKING ME HOW LONGER!!!"

This could also be a use for Jack-of-Trades.  Every level lets you have a
\'free\' interruption.

Given what my paramedic relatives have told be about working an emergency
scene, I would count group tasks as being automatically interrupted
(questions, instructions, and so on) unless the team has practiced.  This
also gives you rules to cope with a shakedown cruise.

NO!  (or if it is, color me greedy :) )

When I saw this thread, I was thinking the exact same thing.  25mm for
roleplaying and 15mm for large scale or starship combat (got all those
deckplans, don\'t you know?).  

I had more to say, but Steve\'s done a great job of covering it.  Just

I like the honor thing, although I may be a bit cynical on this. 
(Nothing to do with 20th (or 18th or 19th) century US politics, I\'m
sure.)  I do see it playing an important part, with letters of
introduction playing a _very_ significant part, since news travels only
as fast as transportation.  Maybe membership in certain
guilds/organizations (some secret) with verifiable
passwords/IDs/whatever to act as introduction also.  This also gives
some capability to \'start over\' with an acquired ID which could be
parleyed into a reputation/social standing over a few years with
subsequent intro to \'polite\' society.  Relatively little way to check
background tens of parsecs away, so must trust references.  Local
nobility plays _large_ part in references as representative of
imperium.  Is \'honor\' an introduction of the Imperium, and does it
extend equally to all, or only in the Imperial sphere of influence?

Never argue with the guy who\'s going to be standing over your sleeping

Seriously, good point.  As someone else pointed out, there is wide
variance in the extent to which attributes should contribute to success
across different tasks.  I just happen to feel that, on the average, a
2-to-1 weighting of attributes vs skills is too heavy.  Maybe it\'s just
my CT prejudices showing.

That\'s one of the reasons I like Traveller so much; adaptation is so
widely accepted.

This is _good_ stuff!  You don\'t happen to have a couple of quick lines

I COMPLETLY agree!  Although CT etc. tended to follow US mil structure,
which did give this old swabbie a nice comfy feeling, the feel of
something _different_ would be nice.  Take that young noble, stick him
in the dirt for four years, then IF he survives, maybe some kind of
officer program.  I think it ties in nicely with the \'even the cook
jumps\' mentality from Starship Troopers.

Hydrogen is a colorless, odorless gas. Liquid hydrogen (LH2) is a clear
liquid, with a temperature *below* 20K (-253.17C or -423.7 F).

There\'s actually little fire hazard in this case, because there will be
too *much* hydrogen (as a percentage of the air) to burn. And the low
temperature will help make ignition unlikely.

There will be lots of splashing and bubbling (remember, the
ridiculously low temp I gave above is the temp LH2 *boils* at!)

> 2. What effect might the sudden loss of fuel flow be on the power plant?

Depends on how fast it is using fuel. If it is using liters per hour,
then it\'ll be a gradual shutdown. If it\'s using "displacement tons" per
minute, it\'ll shutdown right now, and the emergency power systems had
better kick in.

> 3. Anything spectacular or important I should consider in this "accident?"

Well, anybody in or near the path of the LH2 is gonna get flashfrozen.
People farther back will get *severe* frostbite. 

And while it may not be strictly correct, it\'s always a nice touch to
have one of the flash frozen corpses fall over and shatter when it hits
the deck. :-)

Actually, an explosion requires that the hydrogen be *well* mixed with
oxygen, and that the mixture being in a fairly narrow range of relative
percentages. 

In fact, if you dump *lots* of hydrogen into the atmosphere, it *can\'t*
explode (too much hydrogen is as bad as too little). 

Several odd effects are possible with a high hydrogen concentration. 

1. It\'s like helium only worse. Your voice gets *very* "Donald duck"
   like.  
2. Any vacuum tubes in the area (including CRTS) develop leaks rather
   quickly and fail (hydrogen molecules will slip thru cracks that air
   can\'t)
3. anything leaking *oxygen* (or air) into the mostly hydrogen
   atmosphere is a potential fire hazard. So rather than a fire
   starting at the broken fuel lines, it could start at the exhuast
   port of your emergency breathing mask!

That later one is sometimes used in an interesting lab demo. You have a
clear "tank" full of flammable gas, with a bunsen burner inside, and
one sitting on top. The one inside is hooked to an *air* hose. The one
outside is hooked to the same gas outlet that is keeping the tank full.

You light the outside burner, which shows what everyone expects,
namely, gas burning in air.

Then using a glovebox port, or the like, you strike a spark inside the
tank at the top of the burner, while opening the valve on the air
supply leading to. And the class sits there with their mouths hanging
open as you burn *air* in a gas atmosphere.

> could result in a jet of almost invisible steam (or plasma) lancing across

A steam jet will be invisible. A *plasma* jet will be *dangerously*
visible. Plasmas *glow*, due to the constant recombination of the
electrons and ions that make them up. A lot of the glow from your
plasma is going to be in the UV range.

I was just looking at this again.  Basically I like it.  The on thing I
don\'t like is that you can\'t carry over points.  It makes sense in terms
of making sure that exp is applied to skills used in the adventure, but
it doesn\'t allow accumulation of experience across artifically short
adventures to improve chances of skill improvement.  I think it might be
better to let points accumulate to a given amount of time (i.e. a given
point is only good for (say) 6 months after earned, this one is my
preference) or a max number of points. If the points earned during a
given adventure were not used immediately at the end of the adventure,
they would have to be assigned to specific skills used during the
adventure.  This would ensure that experience can only be used for
skills actually exercised.  More flexibility would be allowed if used
immediately since the points dont have to be assigned to a skill until
used.

        OK, I never said this was well thought out, given the time
constraints. But when you jump into the Kuiper belt we\'ll pick up the
gravitational disturbance, and pick up your HEPlaR exhaust on our mondo
massive PEMS, so at least we\'ll know you\'re coming. Then we can send our own

I have just finished reading #10 of Traveller Chronicle.  While I am
impressed by the overall quality of the information on the Solomani Rim,
 I can\'t help but wonder the treatment of Vegans.  For those of you who
haven\'t read the magazine, the author treats the Vegans like humans,
in that they haven\'t recuperated from Virus.

The problem that I have with this question is that, even though I never
saw their stats (I never found the article concerning them), I was told
by a friend of mine (who is on the list and who has an unnatural attraction
to Vegans) that they can live to be 250 years old.

While humans can forget knowledge in a few generations, the length of time
that the \'night\' lasted means that some of the Vegans (if not a lot!) who are
alive today would have been alive during the Collapse.  Assuming they kept 
the knowledge they learned in schools (there is no reason to doubt it), they 
should have been able to recuperate faster than humans.  Furthermore, they 
used to live in a politically stable and united society.  Since a lot of the 
Vegans alive in 1200+ were alive at the time of the collapse, they should still
have the memory of having only one government for them all, achieving unity 
shouldn\'t be a problem.

What do people think.

NOTE: I still haven\'t received my hardcopy of T4.  Anyone knows what is going on
or should I get in touch with them?

I know some people don\'t give a hoot, and that\'s OK.  And maybe there\'s 
not an official answer.

But let me also chime and again insist the Marines are based on the Few 
and the Proud (and maybe not just our Marines).  So yes they should be 
able to attend the Academy, and yes, it should be the Naval Academy.  You 
can have them hang out with the dogfaces if you want, but that\'s not in 
keeping with (to my mind) the proud traditions that are so integral to 
the Corps mentality.  They are *not* soldiers, they are *marines*.  To 
suggest otherwise is an insult, as my dad would insist... ;^)

(Although I heard graduates in the top 25% of their class at West Point 
are eligible to become Marine officers, though many probably do not take 
them up on the offer.)

T:TNE, but I would like to have one from Classic Traveller period. Maybe 
IG could a early example to their web page (hint hint).


2. Re-release The Traveller Adventure: One of the only old Traveller 
books I have is a copy of The Traveller Adventure (The Big Red Book). It 
is a great multi-session adventure. I think it would big a good adventure 
for IG to release.

3. Character sheets in an electronic format: I would love a character, 
sector, ship form I could fill out and print of of my computer. I think 
it is the new trend in gaming, and I think it is long over due.


Any other ideas,

It would take two sets of sculpts.  The problem I have with
compatability with extant 25mm figs is that they all suck.  I guess
guys in vacc suits or power armor might be OK since the head/body
proportions are hidden.  I\'ve always been at a loss since I won\'t buy
poorly proportioned figures, I\'d rather have nothing at all if the
alternative is cartoonish ones.

But that said, if you have a good scupt it\'s easy enough to do.  I
have a white metal setup, but I prefer resin to metal anyway.  Metal
is easier to do in quantity, but the quality is lower (IMHO).  The
Mithral fuigures are sand-blasted, that\'s a nice touch, and it gets
rid of the flash.

Hmmm.  I\'d wanna check and make sure that you don\'t end up earning

The big problem is that it seems as though the task system ends up being

Sorry, but for the majority of us on this list, as Americans, bashing nobles is 
about as old as the country itself...  :-)

All started with that George III guy, whoever he was...

OTOH, it is going to be important to remember that the nobility of 0 
IE is not the nobility of 1116 IE (Rebellion).

The overwhelming majority of the nobility, and indeed the common folk 
WITHIN the Imperium are going to buy into the Imperial dream, and are 
going to find that their interests and Imperial interests are often 
coincidental.  

When playing GDW\'s late era Imperium, the nobles were just as likely 
to be scummy as good in some cases.  In year Zero, this should not be 
the case...

Ask your ISP, there should be an IRC Server that you can use locally 
(they change regularly, so if you have a defult setting in a IRC client , 
chech to see if it works.) If you use OS/2, Windows (95 or 3.1) or 
linux, there is an IRC client you can use (IRCII,or the one I use, 
Internet Adventure OS/2). 

When you log on to an Chat session, issue this command /join #TRAVELLER  


There is IRC 101

Sorry, Mac-only here.  

I suppose some of the source code is generic, in that Pascal is generic. 
However, most of the source code is U/I code, which won\'t translate.

Actually, 20mm figures are 1/72 - that\'s why a lot of WWII and Vietnam lines

The previous government had proven effective at ruling a small centralized
state.  It was participatory in nature, ruled by an aristocratic senate, and
had been in existence for several hundred years.  As the frontier rapidly
expanded, the old government proved incapable of ruling such a large and
diverse area.  It destabilized and various factions fought for control.
Civil wars ensued, usually led by various charismatic generals, bringing
chaos and economic ruin.  Things eventually got bad enough that virtually
everyone was ready to sacrifice their political participation for the sake
of security.

Dictators rise when participatory governments cannot maintain order.  The
first Emperor was not the greatest soldier of his age, nor the most
respected intellect or talented orator.  He was a supremely ruthless and
gifted politician.  He respected the old institutions and aristocrats,
created a great legal code, reduced corruption, quietly stifled dissent,
and, above all, reestablished order.  The vast majority of the people
supported him, recognizing that they could no longer rule themselves.  The
foundation that the first Emperor established would last for over a thousand
years.

Other than the fact that Cleon renamed the senate, the above could apply to
either Augustus, who I think should be our model, or Cleon.  Cleon was
supported by the lower classes because they were tired of the chaos under
the federation.  The nobles were satisfied by the affirmation of their
titles and their inclusion in the new moot.  The business community above
all things wanted order, protection, and a frontier to exploit.  Look at the
non-Viliani megacorps existing at that time: GSbAG (starships), LSP
(mining), and Tukera (shipping).  They would have all have been interested
in a rapidly expanding frontier and the construction or protection of the
Imperial navy.  Judging from the fact that LSP colonized Mora in 60, the
corporations probably led Imperial expansion with the Imperium itself
struggling to keep up.

There would be plenty of dissent.  Some more established noble families
would see Cleon as an interloper.  Other resistance groups would form to
fight the Imperial institutions that we all know and love: feudalism,
autocracy, the noble class, megacorporations, and tolerance of tyrannical
world governments.  The Ine Givar and the Star Vikings have deep roots.

How do the Initial Nobles in the Third Imperium gain their positions? Are
they given out solely to people in positions of political and economic

predating the Third Imperium?

I think this is something that needs to be addressed. There\'s a great
difference between Duke BlahBlah of the Slyean Nobility becoming \'of
the Third Imperium\' compared to Mr. LodsaMoney of Grabbit Industries
becoming a Duke of the Empire - especially as the nobility would be
conferred on thousands (milions?) of individuals virtually at once.

What do think?

The Hindenburg also was not in deep space at the time of its immolation.

Just an observation, but I think the scenario would be *much* more
dangerous in space on a starship.

You\'re right, of course.  OTOH, the book gives _very_ vague guidelines
for assigning experience points anyway, so this was pretty much an issue
already.  I\'m not looking to increase the number of skill levels gained
(it\'ll burn points quickly to optimize your chances), just improve the
flexibility of the system a little.

Perhaps this is something we should all consider doing.  As it appears that
IG is monitoring, perhaps they will listen and respond...

What type or scale of map are you looking for?  As I remember the Referee\'s
manual of MT contained one page maps of: The First Imperium, Rule of Man,
Cultural Regions of the Imperium, and Domains of the Imperium.  Were you
looking for more or less detail?

On a related note, does anyone know how copyright law applies to works
published by defunct companies?  I assume that copyright would still be in
effect and be retained by the copyright holders (ie. IG).  And hence it
would not be possible to make a copy of such a map...  But I do not know.

mb> 2. Re-release The Traveller Adventure: One of the only old
mb> Traveller books I have is a copy of The Traveller Adventure (The
mb> Big Red Book). It is a great multi-session adventure. I think it
mb> would big a good adventure for IG to release.

The problem with doing this is that it is strongly tied to Spinward
Marches, and the Vargr areas of the Third Imperium.  As it appears that IG
will not be visiting those areas for a while.  However, I agree that in
addition to published  single and multiple session adventures, that
frameworks for larger scale champaigns be published as well.

mb> 3. Character sheets in an electronic format: I would love a
mb> character, sector, ship form I could fill out and print of of my
mb> computer. I think it is the new trend in gaming, and I think it is

I\'m glad you asked this...  As I was wondering what to do with my "creation"...
When, I first saw the form posted on IG\'s site, I decided that I wanted to
create a form for myself...  I was just about to fire up a Graphics program
when I realized that I would want to have the form in a format where I
could fill out and print characters that I had created and have it look
great when laser or ink-jet printed.  So instead I created a FileMaker Pro
(3.0, for the Mac) form based on but not identical to IG\'s.

I used 3.0 because, I figured that in the future I might wish to expand
upon the databases and need to have it be capable of Relationships.
However...  I do own a PC Card for my Mac and own FileMaker Pro 2.0 for
both the Mac and PC.  I could be convinced to convert it over to FMP 2.0
for both Mac and PC.  In fact I had already planned to do so.  The question
I have is where should I post what I have done already?

        Well, I\'ll be running TRAVELLER this Friday night and probably for a
number of weeks to come-my players are so hyped they won\'t let me NOT run
it. And since I\'m running two groups in two different time periods (Year 0
and the Virus Era), I suspect I\'ll be playing a lot of T4!

By the way, Ken, while we\'ve got you on the line, I\'m going to air my one
big gripe (my only big gripe) about the new game. The character sheet is too
small!
When you can\'t fit your skills in the skill section and your character has
only served four terms in the Navy, there\'s a problem. I realize this is
niggling, and that the sheet is probably the way it is for space
considerations, but how about having someone design a two sided sheet with
more room for skills and maybe the equipment stuff on the back, and then put
it up on the web site (two GIFS, one for the front, one for the back.) Maybe
later it can be part of a pack of useful forms you could include with the GM
screen.
                         Thanks for listening,

1	3		4
2	6		8
3	9		12
4	12		16
...

in other words, the max modifier is x4 the skill level.

I see this as being justified in that having the inherent
attribute is a big help, but only if you know how to use
it properly...

Does this give too much advantage to those with high skills?
I guess not, because they can only use the asset that they
would have had anyway. 

Or does it screw the skill system up too much? I guess at
low levels it might make the asset too small.

The multiplier could be changed, or there could be some
non-linear settings to skew in favour of lower skill
levels.

Just a thought...

Uh, I\'ll admit to being new to the RPG industry, but isn\'t this kinda weird.
I mean here the RPG company is telling us to make our own variants of the
rules and that their stuff isn\'t necessarily canon and that we each make
upour own canon.  Sheesh, you\'d think these people were trying to make us
happy or womething.  :)  Really, though, good work IG, and thanks Ken.

However, I must say that you should probably just make it available as

Good point.  Just about any adult Vegan would be a remnant...
Heck in 1200, many of them would remember the Solomani Rim War...

Yup, especially seeing as the only oxygen supply for hundreds of

The Sylean Federation did have nobility prior to the Third Imperium.  They 
maintained their noble titles after Cleon came to power.  Remember Cleon was one 
of them.  As other worlds joined the Imperium the nobility of the new planet 
maintained their worldly title and were given Imperium ones.  That was one 
reason why many leaders decided to join the Imperium instead of fight.  It was a 
very effective tool for Cleon to use.  Join me and I will knight you or fight me 
I will destroy you.

Wow.  Blink.  25mm is no where *near* 1:72 to my eye.  Shows how
crappy 25mm minis are (they look bigger).  15mm looks about right I
bet because they are also all crappy proportion wise (almost all
minis are over sculpted is the lesson here).

I haven\'t read anything about the Sylean Federation except what\'s in the MT
Imperial Encylopedia.

What I figure is that the Federation had a democratic form of government,
which was viable because of the small nature of this interstellar gov\'t.
Once Cleon proclaimed the Imperium, (he was probably president of the Sylean
Federation) he took his top elected members (senators, etc.) and made them
nobles, which gave him a core group of important and respected people who
shared his opinions.  THis would allow Cleon to have most nobles on his side
on each issue.

Also, I wouldn\'t be surprised if he fostered some underhanded dealings as
well.  For instance, blackmail, etc. to keep some nobles on his side.

Again, the above is my own personal conjecture :)

Well, I have MT\'s map, but still, a map of the 3rd Imperium circa year 0
would be nice, especially in poster map format.  One hint for IG, I know
this\'ll cost more, but is it possible to print the map on a cloth material.
It can be folded any way you want and doesn\'t tear or rip as easy as paper.
I\'d be willing to pay the extra cost.

How about, release an adventure?  I\'d like any adventure from IG to be
either published formally or on the Web.  At the ery least how about
HTMLizing some of the old \'double adventures\' and such I\'ve heard of, they
have always looked good, and I\'m sure they could be converted to Year O.

a fill out form (perhaps in RTF format?) that I can print out filled in from

Exactly what I had in mind.  If a character is fixing the airraft while
participating in a discussion (or answering questions from a pesky
passenger/reporter), then I would count the discussion as a task with
automatic success.  But the character\'s attribute would still be halved. 
Highly skilled characters can kibitz, those who are deriving things from
first principles must concentrate.

I have always had the impression that the nobility predated the 3rd
Imperium; altho I\'m no longer entirely sure where I got that impression.

I think that they are the remnants of the old Terran naval officers who
filled the shoes of the older Vilani bureaucrats after the Terran
conquest. These then evolved into the warlords who fought it out amongst
themselves during the Long Night. They then became harbingers of
civilisation when they rallied round the flag to form the Sylean
Federation and, later, the Imperium.

I\'ve always figured that their power came from control of the inter-
stellar navies (see the character generation rules in CT: social stand-
ing is very important in the navy) rather than landholdings (they seem
to have little power in most world governments).

This means war.

Battle of Yorktown:  Continental ARMY is backed up by the Navy and Marines..
French Marines.

Washington, War of 1812:  Capital burned after Marine retreat.

China, 1930s:  4th Marine Regiment fails to notice incresing strength of
Japanese Army in China.. evacuated to the Philipines, they surrender en masse.

Normandy, June 6th, 1944:  Overlord, the largest amphibious invasion in
history happens.  There are no USMC units involved.

Inchon, Korean War:  MacArthur splits the North Korean lines with a daring
amphibious invasion, led by the 7th Infantry Division (US Army)

Chosin Resivoir, Korean War:  After marching into a trap, USMC turns around
in full retreat.

Korea, post war: South Korean goverment requests US troops remain, but asks
that the Marines be withdrawn.

There is a vast difference between what happens at the Infantry School at
Ft. Benning, GA, and what happens at a college ROTC course.  Basic Training
is 16 weeks of solid, intensive work to make you an infantryman.  It is
brutal, hard work.  ROTC is a class that you take for maybe 6 or 7 hours a
week, along with your other classes and social life at school.  For two
weeks in the summer, you go to a real unit, where you are basically ignored
by everyone.

After graduation, you are suddenly an Officer of the United States Army.
You attend the Infantry Officers Basic Course (or Armor.. I\'m sticking with
what I know) and are declared to be ready to lead men into combat.

There is a reason that 2nd Lieutenants are considered to be worthless.. they
are for the most part.  They have little or no kmowledge of how the Army
works, are in a position where they are responsible for the lives of 40+
men, and may have signed for millions in equipment.

The best officers don\'t come from West Point or the Citidal.. they are the
ones who rose through the ranks, went to OCS, and bring their real world
knowledge of military matters into their careers as officers.

Most Marines will probably make Corporal in T4 before being selected.  These
guys have proved themselves.  There is an element of nepotism (the SOC bonus
for commission/promotion) but if every Colonel in command of a Regiment
remembers his days as PFC Nobody, the system will, IMHO, run better.

Interesting.  I think you\'re right about the asset being too low at low
skill levels.  I\'m *not* going to do another analysis of it though, but I\'d
like to see it if somebody else does. <g>

I also thought about using the skill level as a multiplier on
attribute. You get some *big* numbers that way. <g>  Too big!

A similar mechanism could apply in Traveller. Use the attributes for

As good a supplement as it is, and there\'s some great stuff in there.  
I\'ve chosen to ignore both pocket empires presented in TC10.  The Vegan\'s 
should have their own pocket empire as should the Solomani (Terran 
region) I don\'t have a problem with a Dingir PE too.  The only problem is 
these things are huge, 20+ stars each.  This throws the whole ballance of 
power in TNE out the window.  The two big players are supposed to be the 
RC and the Regency, suddenly there\'s 4 big players two of whom are more 
interested in duking it out with each other than they are with returning 
the light of civilization to the galaxy.

Don\'t get me wrong I like the ideas behind both pocket empires, they\'re 
just too big.

to control the spacelanes would be critical, and the warlord/

worlds percentage wise would be under complete noble rule near year 0 than
in year 1100.  Later expansion would outstrip the ability of the nobility
to control each world directly.

Hi, Ken. You said on the TML that you were collecting questions
for Marc Miller. Well, here\'s mine:

As you are probably already aware, Traveller enthusiasts on the
Internet have been creating and distributing various works which
are compatible with (and in some cases might arguably be
derivative of) professionally published Traveller material. These
fan-authored works typically consist of computer programs, world
write-ups, character write-ups, adventures, stories, and a wide
assortment of other articles which are reminiscent of what one
might find in an old JTAS. Nearly all the professional games
publishers recognize that their fans are doing this, and except
for the condition that this fan-authored material be made
available free of charge, almost all of these publishers condone
(and sometimes even assist) this activity on the part of their
fans. I say "almost", because one roleplaying games publisher
sticks out like a sore-thumb for its unwillingness to condone
fan-authored works which are compatible with its game system (and
this publisher has even threatened its own fans with legal
action, although it has never been willing to openly discuss the
legal specifics behinds its rationale). I am, of course, speaking
of TSR, the great-granddaddy of RPG publishers. Now my question
to you is, what is your/Imperium Games\' policy toward
fan-authored Traveller-compatible works which are distributed
free of charge over the Internet?

Nick,

It\'s pretty obvious to me that I\'ve been missing out on a lot by being 
very straight-forward in my handling of failure and success.  What you 
point out here is a very good example of how such things should be done.  
It takes more work to consider such factors in determining the effects of 
failure, but it certainly will be worthwhile to do so, I think.  I 
believe players will think so, too!

	I\'d actually rather not see Imperial history just be a rehash of 
Roman history.  Similar forces may be at work, but the hi-tech and 
sophisticated Sylean Federation should be more than the Roman Republic in 
space.

	I agree with this and think that this should play a large part in 
the early empire.  Rather than the Roman model, perhaps we should look 
more to the colonial expansions of the Dutch, British, and Americans 
during the 19th and early 20th centuries.  Here we see commercial 
interests leading political and military interests.  
	The problems confronting the Sylean Federation may have had to do
with the rapid expansion of the megacorps into non-Federation space where
they were unregulated and engaged in all kinds of less than honorable
activities.  The megacorps supported Cleon initially because they 
believed he was a good businessman like themselves, but he used the power 
of the Imperium to expand Sylea\'s sphere of control and curb the 
megacorps\' worst abuses.  This would have given an impetus for the \'corps 
to move even further out, with the Navy not far behind.  Thus, a mechinism 
for the rapid expansion of the empire is in place.

I haven\'t seen this article, but what you\'re saying sounds pretty 
feasible...

Yup...  A strong pair of pocket empires in Solomani Rim would 
probably be able to squash the RC like a bug...

Of course, I was never too crazy about the RC anyways...

Actually, I think it is applicable to something like survey.  Assuming that this 
is applied at an orbital level (I still don\'t have T4, drat this real world), your 
well educated character (sorry, forgot the numbers.....) would have a better chance 
at doing _one_ type of survey (say something equivelant to a releaf map).  But, if 
whoever asked for that survey also wanted population densities, and power distribution
centers, and .......  If time is a luxury (from my position, it never is), your low-
skill, high-edu person could do a better job, but the high-skill, low-edu person could
do it faster.

This sounds like an aspect that I do like (if I could only get a hold of a copy and 
read it).  I\'ll still have problems with the quassian distribution and .5d6 though.....

What Steve said!  Why do we see figures with weapons that are obviously too
big to carry?  Ok, we have gravitic assistance (FGIP-15, e.g.), but not for
_every_ weapon.  I usually cut the weapons down to size with an Exacto knife
and metal files, but I\'d prefer just to buy them usable off the shelf.

I look for human proportions on miniature human figures; for that reason,
that I often use HO scale plastic figures (Airfix, Esci, Ertl, Matchbox).
The Grenadier 25mm Traveller figures were right on, too.

Like those Atlantic sets "Mao and the Chinese Revolution" and "Lenin and the
Russian Revolution"?  Cool -- or maybe more like the Atlantic Coliseum set?
After all, the Imperial Court will be big.  I visualize it looking somewhat
like the imperial court in the Jodorwsky/Moebius three-part graphic novel
"The Incal."  Now certainly, it would grow with time, but even by the Year
0, Cleon would\'ve been in power in the Sylean federation for some time and
would have a really big meeting place.

Stu, it looks like the 0 IE nobles\' marketing people have completely
brainwashed you.  The nobles of 0 IE became nobles by holding on to whatever
their ancestors had managed to grab during and after the collapse of the
Rule of Man -- and those ancestors had been carpetbaggers in the collapsed
Ziru Sirka.  Nobles have a predisposition -- possibly genetic -- to violence
and theft.  They had in 1116 IE, they had it in 0 IE, they even had it 1500
AD -- and at all other times in human history.  

That\'s not to say that nobles are stupid -- to the contrary.  If their
interests and the Imperium\'s coincide, they\'ll certainly support the
Imperium.  It\'s in their interests to appear to have the people\'s good in
mind, so they appear to act appropriately.  It\'s in their best interests to
hide or deny evidence of past violence and theft, so they do.  

"Daddy, how did we come to be the dukes of this subsector?" -or-
"Your Grace, how did your family come to be the dukes of this this subsector?"

"Well, after our glorious Solomani ancestors pushed over the already rotten
and decadent Vilani empire, they sent administrators to teach the Vilani how
to improve themselves.  Our many-times great-grandfather, Lucius O\'Trigger,
the commander of a small but brave fleet, was sent to pacify and adminster
this region.  Lucius conquered the rebels and wons the hearts of the local
people.  He then set about rebuilding the subsector, setting a good example
by personally purchasing several industrial and agricultural concerns that
needed to be turned around.  He succeeded so well that the Terran government
did not see fit to send a replacement when he retired, and asked that he
select his own successor.  He chose his first-born daughter, Lucia, who
assumed the title of Admiral and control of the business interests.  Over
time, the Terran government evolved into the Rule of Man, in a story you
well know, and the best of the Terran military governors were created
nobles.  Lucia\'s son Lucash was the First Duke of the subsector...."

Do I need to deconstruct this typical family myth, or can I leave it as an
exercise for the reader?

This has been addressed in numerous works that I\'m too lazy to cite.  The
history goes like this (caveat lector:  I haven\'t purported to be objective;
this reflects my view of history.  If you want "just the facts" you\'ll have
to look at the canon):

A long time ago, the Terrans crushed the 10,000 year-old Vilani Empire (the
Ziru Sirka), and sent military governors to rule it.  This overextended the
Terran government\'s resources.  Seizing on this instability, an ambitious
admiral named Estagarribia declared himself emperor, and formed the second
empire, formally called the Rule of Man. 

The Rule of Man (also called the Ramshackle Empire) barely held itself
together long enough for the Terrans (now known as Solomani, because many
were no longer born on or anywhere near Terra) to grab virtually all of
power and wealth in what had been the Ziru Sirka.  The descendants of the
military governors sent by the Terran government to consolidate gains and
kill any Vilani still interested in fighting the N+1 Interstellar War became
the nobility of the Rule of Man.

When the RoM collapsed, the nobles held on to what they had (as nobles do --
as anyone does), and formed "pocket empires" out of what they controlled.
By the time Cleon was running the Sylean empire, there were many nobles with
sizeable holdings who wanted a free hand to keep on extracting wealth for
generations to come.  Cleon needed the nobles\' support to form the Third
Imperium, so guaranteed to confirm their titles and powers.

        Even if you don\'t make a cloth map, please sell unfolded maps,
rolled in tubes, for those of us who\'d like something without all the

Bingo, the Imperium is and was a trade federation.  Hence the 
laissez-faire attitude about internal politics of member worlds, and 
hence the obsession with protecting trade, even at the possible cost 
of personal freedom...

Well stated...  But I\'d be just as disappointed if the 3rd Imperium 
is Pax Brittanica in space, as well...

Obviously, there are going to be corrupt nobles.  Human beings, by 
their very nature are going to be vain, greedy, arrogant, 
megalomaniacal, etc...  On the other hand, not all actions by the 
nobility are going to be openly cynical...or cynical in any way...  

Many of the ruling class in Europe thought they were doing a service 
when they subjugated the primitive peoples of Asia, Africa, and the 
Americas...  To some, indeed most people, it was about money...  To others, 
it was about a higher purpose...  And to somebody who\'d lived through 
1800 years of the middle ages...in a world without the resources and 
advantages of Terran prime world, life under the most corrupt of 
nobles would be better, if trade is restored, if your family has hope 
of someday getting off of that backwater world, etc.  

This is the gist of what I\'m getting at...  In the early years of the
Imperium, when the boundaries are going to be expanding at a rapid
rate, there is no reason for a noble to focus inward...when he can
build his power base by grabbing the system 2 parsecs over that\'s just
getting out of the long night.

If all in your game is dirt, grit, and corruption, its going to be a depressing 
game...  It shouldn\'t all be dirt, grit and corruption in 0 I.E.  Some of it will be, 
most certainly not all of it...  There are do gooders in this world.  
There are even do gooders who gain political and economic power...  
There just aren\'t tons of them...

But when they can sate their desires on building power in new 
territory, why go after the throne itself...

Now later, when the borders have stabilized, and there are no more 
worlds to conquer...then it becomes a lot dicier proposition...can 
you say civil war, and right of assassination?  I knew you could...

Huh? Where did you get *that* idea? 25mm figures are 25mm:6 feet. Or
roughly 1 inch:6 feet. That\'s 1:72.

20mm is about 1:90 scale. 

And 15 is 1:120 scale.

Nah. The hatches close and the automatic system vents the compartment
to vacuum. 

And as I pointed out, the flammability range of hydrogen, while large,
isn\'t *that* large. Too much or too little and I don\'t care *how* many
sparks there are, it won\'t ignite. 

And hydrogen is second only to helium for heat conductivity. It
conducts heat like mad. One of the problems in deep sea habitats, which
use heliox, and in the deeper ones, use hydrogen/oxygen as the
breathing mixture, is that you have to crack the temperature *way* up
to keep folks from getting hypothermia. The gases just *suck* the heat
out of you. 

So, give anything approaching intelligent design, the fire hazard is
not as bad as folks are making it out to be. One hazard that *hasn\'t*
been mentioned is the danger of many cryogenic gases (LH2, LN2, LHe)
causing the accumulation of liquid *oxygen* if they are exposed to air.
Being so cold, they tend to liquify the air even faster than they
evaporate. And both liquid air and LOX are fire hazards because they
are such strong oxidizers.

Come to think of it, am LH2 leak would trigger the hull breach alarms,
simply because it\'d cause such a *drop* in air pressure as the air in
contact with it liquefied. The hydrogen evaporated in the process
wouldn\'t keep up. Especially if the LH2 was "sprayed" into the
compartment. 

So you\'d have the alarms trigger, and regardless of whether they
thought it was a hull breach, a hydrogen leak, or a fire they\'d do the
same thing. Seal off the hatches and air intakes/outlets, then since
anyone in the compartment who hadn\'t gotten to emergency gear is "dead"
already, activate the "vent to space" system.

Then, if sensors indicated a fuel leak, they\'d shut off the fuel feed.

Anyone not flash frozen is in danger of passing out from the pressure
drop. If they can get to the nearest emergency locker, they can grab an
oxygen supply for the emergency vacuum suit" that is part of standard
gear for working in engineering spaces (basicly, you wear a "skin suit"
under the coverall, and it has a "hood" that unrolls into a *flimsy*
helmet, and you have gloves on the belt).

If they aren\'t wearing the suit, or don\'t react in time, too bad.

Cloth is a bitch to handle. On the other hand, while it *does* take
some special handling at the printing plant, Tyvek might work rather
nicely. It\'s chemical resistant, *very* hard to tear, and I don\'t think
it\'ll crease well either. The chemical resistance (and general
"slickness") is why it\'s hard to print on. But if you get an ink
that\'ll stick, you don\'t need to worry about players spilling stuff on
it. Just make them take it outside and hose it off!

It\'d also be a nice touch having the map printed on something that\'s
close to what the Imperium is likely to print things on. :-)

For a *real* nice touch, try and format the map (labels, styling, etc)
like a USGS or the like map, only have it be printed by the Imperial
Interstellar Scout Service...

Check USGS maps, both land ones and naval charts to get the styling
and "flavor" right. For one thing, the background may well *not* be
black. It takes a lot of ink to do that. And gloss is right out!

Yikes, you\'re right.  I always forget the stupid Xmm scales.  In
that case 25mm is well and truely crap.  I have plenty of 1:72
models, and the figures are the same height as most 15mm figs I\'ve
seen.  25mm figs are much closer to 1:48.  If they *claim* to be
25mm, but most human figures are taller than 6ft to scale, they
aren\'t 25mm.

That\'s a lot of the problem (aside from people that can\'t sculpt)
right there.  If I made a 1:72 warplane model that was 25%+ off
scale wise modelers would notice.

So, I am for 1:72 scale figures.  If the lead ones don\'t look like
the ones in model kits, they ain\'t 1:72 :-P

Ho!  Ho!  I realize BASIC has a bad reputation, but you *can* write well
structured and "correct" code with it...if you try really hard. I picked
BASIC for the comparison because it is also usually interpreted rather than
compiled.  <g> Personally, I prefer Pascal but that\'s another story.

Here\'s what I hope Java will give us.  A single source code (or pcoded
object) file that can run on a large number of platforms: Mac, Windows,
*nix, OS2, AS400, etc.  It would be *nice* if it was also a good language
with plenty of RAD tools. <g>

Interesting concept, but it is a bit drastic.  Maybe if the max
applicable attribute was (7 + skill ) or some such...

 skill   max attribute   total max
 level   usable          asset
 1       8                 9
 2       9                11

 4       11 (B)           15
 ...
 8+	 15 (F)		  23+

Who knows?

But what about attribute division for multiple actions?

As another USN vet, I\'d like to point out that the Marines also have
this charming habit of going ashore, living in foxholes, eating cold
ratiions, and battling with various lower life forms while we eat hot
food, sleep in clean bunks, and lob high explosives over (hopefully)
their heads.

Believe me, we do appreciate not having to do the things those lads do!

Plus such things as automatic isolation and evacuation of the
compartment if necessary to save the ship.  Yeah, it\'s rough on the
engineers, but \'you knew the job was dangerous...\'. Recall those WWII
sub movies where the guys are locked in the flooding engine room as the
boat settles to the bottom.  Always gives me the willies. :-[

Yes, but most of that info is year 1000+, right?  I like the idea of the
Imp. Marines having a tradition of officers from the ranks (or nobles
_through_ the ranks).  Nothing says we have to mirror US military
structure.

Nice analysis!

One thing I thought of was a \'panic locker\', a small booth you can dive
into and seal behind you when the compartment evac/isolation alarms go
off.

PS:  I agree, with the Vegans lifespan *very* little (if any) knowledge
would be lost in the the 75-80 years of the collapse.  Think of it like a
25 year hiatus for human culture, every middle aged person would have been
fully adult at the time of the collapse, and would have had the benefit of
high tech education...  I doubt recovery would take very long once the
virus itself died down, and the vampire fleets stopped attacking.

As a Traveller returnee (if there\'s such a word), I am well and truely

When I last played Traveller (CT), as a young lad our group had no
concept of history or the cannonical traveller galaxy (back then Star
Wars was fresh on the scene and as an 11 year old boy I loved it).  Our
galaxy was full of storm troopers and tie fighters.  Plus this tall evil
dude all in black kept cropping up in the camapign, if I remember right
he had a bit of a bad breathing problem too....  I digress...

Is there anywhere I can go to get a timeline and some background on all
this history I keep hearing about?  The Sylean Federation, the
Rebellion, the Virus, Cleon, Norris (two people I\'ve heard mentioned who
I guess are important)?

I believe it was the Miniatures Faq that your page points to which said 
that Pine Sol is the best for this.  Put some pine-sol in a container - 
fill it full enough to cover the figure - then put the figure in it.  
Leave it there for 24 hours.  Then, use a toothbrush to remove the paint, 
and put it back in there for another 24.  Use a toothbrush again.
It may be darker in color after this process.  If so, just scrub it real 
good with a toothbrush and some dish- or hand-soap.

I haven\'t tried it, but IIRC that is what the miniatures FAQ said was the 
process.

Have we considered doing something really simple?  Allow the GM to make an
arbitrary decision on accomplishing certain tasks.  No matter how naturally
talented you might be:

* you MUST have Medical 4 before you can do brain surgery.
* you MUST have Computer 3 before you can break this security code.
* you MUST have Forgery 5 before you can re-create this document.

etc.  No messy charts or division.  Just a simple requirement.

2. All About The Traveller Mailing Lists

   There are two Traveller Mailing lists, these are TML and XTML. Both of
   these lists exist as a means for the Traveller Player/GM to exchange
   ideas and discuss the various aspects of the Traveller System, and its
   universe.

   The Traveller Mailing List (TML) is open to discussions on all aspects
   of Traveller. This includes Marc Miller\'s Traveller, Traveller: The
   New Era, Mega Traveller and Classic Traveller. This also includes the
   background.

   The Xboat Traveller Mailing List (XTML) is for discussions relating to
   Classic Traveller, MegaTraveller and the Traveller universe dating
   prior to the Rebellion.

  2.2. How Do I Unsubscribe?

   To leave the TML, send a message to majordomo@MPGN.COM and in the body
   put the lines:

   unsubscribe traveller
   unsubscribe traveller-digest

   This will ensure that you are no longer subscribed to either real time
   or digest mode.
   To leave the XTML, the body of the message should be

   unsubscribe xboat
   unsubscribe xboat-digest
     _________________________________________________________________

3. What are the etiquette rules for the lists?

   Here are a few guidelines for posting your thoughts to the TML. Please
   note that they are only guidelines. They are intended to make
   everybody\'s life easier by keeping the noise level down and keeping
   the content high.
     * All messages should have a meaningful title. Please don\'t use "Re:
       Traveller-digest V1996 #2" or anything similar.
     * Any message which is over about 150 lines should be labelled as
       LONG in the title. This gives a warning to those running terminal
       sessions over slow links.
     * If you have a very long message that is not relevant to everybody,
       please consider making it available on an FTP or WWW site instead.
       Then announce it\'s existance on the list. A good example of
       material suitable for this is program listings and scripts.
     * Flame wars should be quickly extinguished or moved to personal
       email addresses.
     * When quoting, please follow these guidelines:
          + Please quote the minimum amount possible to show what you are
            responding to. Remember, everybody has already read the
            original message, they just need to remember it! :-)
          + Please don\'t paste in 5 generations of replies on a
            particular topic, or an entire 150 line message. Excerpts
            work best.
          + Don\'t quote signatures.
          + Don\'t quote a message just to say "me too"
     * Signatures should be limited to around 4 lines please.

   Thanks.  It is assumed that they used Imperial computer standards just
like
everyone else (with certain interface adaptations).  This would also be true
of other
alien races in the Imperium.  The Vegans\' main problem is that they had very
high
tech levels across the board--this only increased the effects of the
Collapse.  If you
have collapsed a subsector in New Era, you soon realize that being TL 14-15
only
means that you get more D6 thrown against you, and the more likely you are to
end
up back in the Stone Age.

   The actual number is more like 200.  A lengthy article on the Vegans will
appear
in TTC#11, along with a simple character generation sequence for your friend.

   Your assumption is that enough of the technically-oriented individuals
from the
various tuhuir survived, and that they have enough equipment to work with.
 Also,
you\'re assuming that they were able to come up with a solution to the Virus
problem
beyond blowing up the machine or disallowing certain forms of input which
would
prevent further infections.  Big assumptions.

   There are reasons why cultures are stable.  One is that they are naturally
harmonious.  The other is that some internal or external force keeps the
society
harmonious.  Removing that force would cause the society to fall apart.

   Gee, so creatures that live for 200 years don\'t breed?  That might explain
certain
things if you take an Augustine view of things....

   Of course there would be Vegans alive who would remember the First
Solomani
Rim War.  The question is, are they in a position in 1202 of doing anything
with that
knowledge?

   Too bad, because you\'re going to miss out on some good essays about them,
and
the detailed rationale (storyline-wise) as to why they end up existing.  In
my not-so-
humble-opinion, the storyline I have created is less bleak, less of many of
the things
non-TNE fans hated most about the TNE storyline than anything published by
GDW.

   There are two reason the Vegans don\'t have a pocket empire in 1202: the
story
reason and the creative one.  The story reason I\'d rather not dicuss at the
moment,
but the creative reason has to do with discussions I had with Dave Nilsen a
couple
of years or so ago.  Originally, I had several development plans in mind for
the
Solomani Rim.  One involved the possibility of four pocket empires in the
Rim: the
Easter Concord, the Vegan Polity, the Dingir League, and the Terran Republic.
Another involved three: the Vegans, the Dingirans, and the Terrans.  The
final one
involved two pocket empires, the Dingirans and the Terrans.  After my
discussions
with Dave, I decided to proceed with development of the final option, with
the Vegans
of Muan Gwi still having starflight technology, but no pocket empire.

>This throws the whole balance of  power in TNE out the window.

   Wrong.  While the Dingir League and the Terran Republic are both more
powerful
than the RC, they do not have powerful friends (the Hivers) that they can
call upon.
They also have another *big* problem:  Cymbeline is in the same sector, and
the
Vampire Highway seperates the Dingirans and the Terrans from the RC.  It
should
also be apparent that the Dingir League and the Terran Republic don\'t like
each other
very much.  Both powers therefore have enough to worry about (each other)
without
concerning themselves with some Hiver client states that have popped up in
the Old
Expanses.

>The two big players are supposed to be the  RC and the Regency, suddenly
there\'s
>4 big players two of whom are more  interested in duking it out with each

>they are with returning  the light of civilization to the galaxy.

   I would not call the RC a "big player", unless you count their big money
backers
(the Hivers) into the equation.  As for the Terrans and the Dingirans, they
really aren\'t
big players either.  They may be big players in the Solomani Rim, but they do
not
have the resources or the logistical capabilities to create anything
resembling the
vast empire that the Regency is capable of creating.  Even if they combined
their
resources and tried, the result would be a false dawn over a region of about
four
sectors or so that would collapse in on itself in short order.  Just because
you can
project power doesn\'t mean that you can sustain it, or that it is wise to do
so.
Time and again people within the RC question the wisdom of trying to operate
over
the entirety of the Diaspora Sector, and every so often the RC gets burned
(Vampire
ship raids on virtually defenseless RC worlds, the threat of a war with the
Empire of
Solee they may not win, and of course conflict with the Guild) to prove their
point.

>Don\'t get me wrong I like the ideas behind both pocket empires, they\'re
 just too big.

   Check the population stats of the worlds in the Terran Republic.  You\'ll
find that
many of the worlds they claim are uninhabited.  Same goes for the Dingir
League.
Of the worlds that are inhabited, most all of them have rather low tech
levels (below
that capable of constructing starships).  While they may seem vast in
comparison
to other "pocket empires", both the Terran Republic and the Dingir League
really
aren\'t as big or as powerful as they would first appear.

*sigh*... I think this is a good idea too, _but_...

I teach Java, C++ etc and as much as Java is pretty
good, there\'s still a lot missing from it. I could come up with
a program that\'s a million time slicker and that runs faster using
using C++ and MFC, but will only run under Win95. You win some, you 
lose some.

Also, Java is in a state of rapid change... my subsector viewer
workes under Netscape 2, but not under Netscape 3 or IE 3. I haven\'t
had time to fix it yet.

Anyways, when I find the time (ha!) I will continue improving
my Java subsector viewer. Maybe I will stick a database behind it
or something.

Oh, and as for nasty engineer deaths,

have the fuel line spring a leak. In response, to remove the explosion
hazard, the ship\'s saftey system does an automatic vacuum purge.
One set of freeze-dried engineers. :)

forideas about Cleon, did say:
- --BEGIN QUOTE--
Dictators rise when participatory governments cannot maintain order.  The
first Emperor was not the greatest soldier of his age, nor the most
respected intellect or talented orator.  He was a supremely ruthless and
gifted politician.  He respected the old institutions and aristocrats,
created a great legal code, reduced corruption, quietly stifled dissent,
and, above all, reestablished order.  The vast majority of the people
supported him, recognizing that they could no longer rule themselves.  The
foundation that the first Emperor established would last for over a thousand
years.

Other than the fact that Cleon renamed the senate, the above could apply to
either Augustus, who I think should be our model, or Cleon.  Cleon was
supported by the lower classes because they were tired of the chaos under
the federation.  The nobles were satisfied by the affirmation of their
titles and their inclusion in the new moot.  The business community above
all things wanted order, protection, and a frontier to exploit.  Look at the
non-Viliani megacorps existing at that time: GSbAG (starships), LSP
(mining), and Tukera (shipping).  They would have all have been interested
in a rapidly expanding frontier and the construction or protection of the
Imperial navy.  Judging from the fact that LSP colonized Mora in 60, the
corporations probably led Imperial expansion with the Imperium itself
struggling to keep up.
- --END QUOTE----

I\'ve been planning on using Augustus as my model for Cleon, but this 
presupposes some events.  Specifically
1.  The Sylean Federation has been expanding, but has enemies that are a 
significant threat; enough so that the Federation sometimes has to play its 
foreign enemies off of each other.  There are also lots of "little players" who 
individually are not a threat, but collectively exert a major impact on 
Federation foreign and military policy.
2.  The Federation is in the midst of a period of massive economic growth; so 
much so that it has created a chaotic economic situation of runaway inflation.
3.  As an outgrowth of 1 and 2, there has been an increasing "centralization" 
of authority in the Federation which has kept the situation under control.  
However, it has also proved to be a system vulnerable to manipulation or 
outright takeover by certain powerful and ambitious individuals.  These efforts 
have thus far been foiled through incompetence, competition from other 
powerfull and ambitious individuals, or by the efforts of more "populist" 
leaders (who are themselves powerful and ambitious).

This is not an attempt to directly map the Roman Empire/Republic onto the Third 
Imperium.  What I am aiming for is creating a similar set of circumstances..  
What this boils down to is Cleon is NOT the first Emperor-like ruler of the 
Third Imperium; he is the one who first acknowledged the situation and 
attempted to codify it.

So what this means is to get a good picture of Cleon\'s motives and methods you 
need a good backhistory of the Federation.  My backhistory will look like the 
Late Republic (with some very important differences; no Servile Revolts for 
example).  Work is busy, but I may try to write this up this week.

This makes perfect sense, I think. There are *some* activities that
require a certain level of expertise no matter how naturally-skilled
you are.

I admit my first reaction to the greater weight put on controlling
attributes was quite negative. I\'ve interviewed candidates that were
fresh out of school with doctorates, and they are usually lacking in
comparison to people with a bachelor\'s or master\'s degree and some
experience. Then I realized that the difference in the EDU attribute
would only be 1 or 2.

Of course, this only works if you don\'t get more than 1 level or so
in a skill for your whole college experience (so as not to double the
impact of the increased EDU). If you wan\'t to be more realistic, you
should give the "fresh out" a higher level in a very specialized form
of the skill (e.g., to represent a thesis).

As a former USN sailor myself, I well remember the friendly rivalry between the various 
branches of the naval service -- _even those aboard the same ship_. Airdales ragged on 
the deck apes. The deck apes give the snipes hell. The snipes snigger at the "p*ck*r 
checkers." 

Of course, everyone in a Navy uniform dissed the Gyrenes. Uncle Sam\'s Misguided 
Children, we called them . . . the jokes were legendary and not suited for a family 
mailing list.

While we Navy guys bagged something fierce on the good men of the Corps, we all 
understood that this was all in good fun. Only very new Marines took the ritual dissing 
as anything but good fun -- the one time, back when I was Young And Stupid[tm], that I 
gave some new Marines hell, I had a brawl on my hands (the bruises were interesting). 
With more senior Marines, there was never a case of violence (they could, with their 
experience, take me apart!).

Still, the respect was still there. Navy does stuff the Corps can\'t; the Corps carries 
out missions the Navy can\'t.

Read EO a couple of weeks ago. Yep, it\'s a Jack Ryan book. OP-CENTER MUST DIE!! Yep, 
it\'s LONG, like _Debt of Honor_. Is it good? IMHO, Yes, but TC\'s done better. Both _The 
Sum of All Fears_ and _DoH_ were better, by the standards Clancy set by his longer Jack

Tyvek isn\'t all that expensive to print on (family member in the business
as source material----) for a run of about 20000 the price of those
Tyvek jackets you see around is about $40 a pop.  It\'s gotta be a lot less
for a map (it\'s flat).

Okay, here\'s a quasi-off-topic question.  Suppose the LH2 flooded
compartment in vented into space, taking (for the purposes of discussion)
say 4 cubic meters of various and asundry liquified gases and spewing them
out of the ship.  What\'s the plume gonna look like?  Anyone feel like
calculating the rate of expansion?  Will the gas diffuse rapidly enough to
knock the ship off kilter at all?

Also remember the old medical maxim: "You\'re not dead until you\'re warm
and dead."  Might it be possible to recover a flash frozen individual?
The only problem would be that the water in one\'s cells tends to explode
the cell membrane when it freezes, but also consider that most spacers
(accustomed to working in zero-g that is) contain LESS water in their
bodies.   I recall reading that a major problem that the astronauts that
return from the shuttle missions encounter is severe dehydration when they
come back.

1.	THE WORLDWIDE SPREAD OF T4

The softcover arrived at _The Games Cupboard_, Canberra, Australia on Monday
26th August. Tim sais this meant it was at the distributors (Jedko Games,
Melbourne??) on the previous Friday.

Is anyone doing a study of this?? (Even offhand?)

2.	CHRIS FOSS

BTW, I thought Chris\' art looked familiar. I have a number of E. E. "Doc"
Smith books, comprising snippets of the "Skylark" and "Lensman" series, plus
the *entire* decalogue of the "Family D\'Alembert" series (which bears a
striking resembance to Traveller). Chris\' artwork is plastered all over the
front covers of these books!! Some of the T4 artwork is similar to these
covers, especially:
	_Children of the Lens_ - Patrol Cruiser?
	_Getaway World_ - similar hoop to the Lab Ship?
	_The Bloodstar Conspiracy_ - it looks like a CT-scout joined up with some
other unfinished-looking triangular hull.

Why do you think the Lab Ship\'s two looping prongs are unnecessary? You
could still spin the ship to get "gravity" from centrifugal force. This was
always the concept, even with the full CT hoop - the handwaving is that some
experiments require gravity, but grav plates do not foot the bill. Maybe
they would introduce too many variables into the experiment, rendering the
results "tainted"? Maybe the constant fluctuation of the inertial dampers
makes unstable compounds dangerous? Bruce Johnson, can you give us your
opinion on this?

3.	DEEP SPACE CALIBRATION POINTS

Dave Golden said:
>	Otherwise, just accelerate real slow.

This would make the "Battle for Calibration Point Charlie" (_Regency
Sourcebook_ p10, just above the execrable poem) really something to see!!
All these huge warships trying to maneuver around at 10 kph (or whatever).
They would all be sitting ducks - no wonder the battle was slated as memorable.

4.	THE IMPERIUM = ROME

The more I find out, the closer this seems to be... Imperial Rome, when it
conquered new lands, left the local laws and law structures in place
whereever it could. Naturally, there was always the Roman governor at the
top (eg. Pontius Pilate), but the original local rulers were allowed a
limited jurisdiction (eg. Herod, in Galilee). For the most part, local law
prevailed. Certain Roman laws were imposed (eg. If so ordered, you had to
carry a Roman legionnaire\'s kit). Appeals could be made to the governor, and
offences requiring execution (in local law) had to be brought to the
governor (eg. if crucifixion was considered necessary).

The Trav hook? Local law levels, rules, etc. Remain in place when a planet
joins the Imperium. In fact, the imperium is even more laissez-faire about
this than Rome was.

I\'m afraid I don\'t agree with Joe (yes I know it was tongue-in cheek!): if
the Imperium allows places like Endup (Gulf/Deneb 0436) to exist, it is not
the nicest government to have (SEE _Regency Sourcebook_ p64 for Endup details).

Bill Rutherford said:
>...Stone Mountain) can be done on a dining room table in 15mm; it requires the

You have a BASEMENT?!?

Seriously, I would have preferred to go to 25mm, but no-one stocked the RAFM
miniatures. I found some others that "made do" but never enough. I didn\'t
want my guys to shoot at *stormtroopers* in Traveller - just lost the
flavour, somehow.

My main reasons for 25mm are:
1.	I\'m an old AD&Der (sorry), and I\'m used to that scale.
2.	They are (generally) not as crude as the 15mm models.
3.	They are easier to paint details on.
4.	I agree with Douglas Berry: " ...most Traveller combat takes place in
confined spaces..." (looking forward to the adv cbt rules, BTW).

6.	IRON FIST

Argh! You stole my name! (Only kidding, mine is the *Eisern Faust*, an
ex-Ine Givar stealth intruder scout, designed under MT).

And now a general question: how do you make a TNE/QSDS stealth ship? Under
MT, you made the thing Faint and then added EMM Masking to reduce emissions
to Nil. What now?

You won\'t get very much thrust that way. There\'ll be a *little*, but
since the gases can expand freely, 90% of the vectors cancel. It takes
carefully constructed expansion nozzle to get much thrust out of
expanding gases.

Notice much thrust from that pop-top can? Nope. Expand the same amount
of gas through a properly designed nozzle and you\'ll be able to *feel*
the push.

As for what it\'ll look like, there\'ll be a lot of "ice" crystals as
some of the liquid components get cooled below freezing by the
evaporation/expansion. Most of these won\'t last long, but between that
and condensation/expansion effects, I\'d guess that you\'d have a plume
that starts out white with "sparkles" and rapidly becomes transparent. 

Think of the plume from a tea kettle, or from a CO2 extinuisher.

Actually, a ship in space is pretty much fireproof. Turn off the
gravity and you\'ve just killed the convection currents. Turn off the
ventilators, and there\'s no way for the combustion products to move
away from the fire, or for oxygen to move towards it. Well, there *is*
diffusion, but that\'s fairly slow. Then vent the compartment to space,
and the fire is out.

One interesting thing most non-spacers don\'t realize about "stopping" a
fire by killing the grav plates and ventilators is that you have a
dangerous situation until you *carefully* replace the air, or *rapidly*
vent it to vacuum. All you\'ve done is "suspend" the fire. So unless you
wait a *long* time for the various chemical radicals created by the
partial combustion to diffuse and react, they\'ll picj right back up
where the left off if you supply gravity or air circulation!

Opening a "burned" compartment and disturbing the air is likely to
result in a brief but intense "flame burst" due to mixing the gases.
Sort of a spacegoing version of a backdraft.

Old hands demonstrate this to newbies by shutting off the ventilators
in a compartment while a candle is burning. Then they kill the grav
plates. The flame goes spherical, then you have a little globe of smoke
sitting there. Wave your hand to create a breeze and it\'ll start up
again for a moment (wait too long and it\'ll disperse). Turn on the grav
plates and it\'ll start burning again. 

(The above is actual, *real* science!) 

It\'s been suggested that we could produce certain compounds simply by
starting a flame then killing gravity, extracting the radicals from the
"smoke" zone, and then restarting. There are probably easier ways to do
it, but it is a possibility.

Ships on the ground *worry* their captains because of the elevated fire
danger (much like seagoing vessels are at risk in drydock) the regular
fire-fighting gear doesn\'t work. This may explain why many ships prefer
to dock at a "high port" rather than land. It lets the ship be safe
with much cheaper fire fighting gear.

I\'ll have to remember to put lots of fire fighting gear in the "berths"
on the ground.

In any case, the above leads to some interesting possibilities. Besides
the dangers of ignorant passengers rushing into compartments that have
"sleeper" fires in them, think of the fun of boarding a derelict. Even
if it is old, it\'s still possible that there\'s a fire that\'s been just
barely holding on and just *waiting* for something to stir up the
atmosphere. Especially if the ship is derelict due to battle damage.

Don\'t worry. Unless they were operating in *very* shallow water the
pressure will crush the hull (and them) long before they can drown.

Possible, but you\'d need several, as you never know *which* section of
wall is going to be in the middle of the "problem". And even then,
given Murphy, the only one in reach will require you to run *through*
the LH2 spray!

In any caser, always remember that the answer to "How long do I have to
get to shelter?" is "How long can you hold your breath?" and if there\'s
a pressure drop, it\'s much less than that as you don\'t *dare* hold your
breath (ask any scuba diver what happens to an idiot how holds his
breath during as little as a 20 foot ascent)(1 atm = 30 feet of water)

One accidental purchase I made many years ago has been very useful ever
since I got into gaming. I bought an aluminum ruler 2 feet long at an
office supply store, and didn\'t look at it carefully. I *thought* the
extra scales were metric. They weren\'t. I\'d purchased a "printer\'s
ruler" normally used for layout work.

What\'s nice is that one of the scales is "Picas". That is, markings
every sixth of an inch, numbered sequentialy by sixes. So I can lay it
down and read off 1/72 scale feet *directly*. Clear out to 144 feet.
The other scale on that side is 6 & 12 point pica, which is numbered
the same, but has marks twice as often. So that let\'s ne measure 1/72
in *half* foot increments. 

The other side is just inches (by 1/16ths) and "agate" which is 1/7
inch markings. Never found a use for that one. :-)

But the two pica scales are wonderful. I\'ve had folks want to steal the
ruler when they realized that I could read off scale feet *directly*
with 1 foot or 6 inch resolution. :-)

Sure, you can use one of thos silly architects triangular rulers, but
they are harder to read, fragile (or expensive!), the marks wear off,
and they are less than a foot long. This is two feet long. A nice size.

Actually, Alaska (or at least good chunks of it) is UTC-9. 
There\'s also an Atlantic time zone (Eastern Canada) that is UTC-4, and
Newfoundland (or parts of it) is UTC-3.5.

Here\'s a table:

Standard Time		Daylight Time
(Nov thru Mar)	UTC	(Apr thru Oct)
- ----	----	----
		-2.5	Newfoundland
                -3	Atlantic
Newfoundland	-3.5

Traveller spacers generally spend little time in zero-g. But on the
other hand, the quicker you get frozen the less damage the ice crystals
do (as they tend to be tinier). So it\'s a *chance*, but not a big one.

    'body' => '  Looking over the UWPs for Core that are given in Traveller*, I
  note that none of the worlds listed as inhabited (assumed to
  be the Sylean Federation) are incapable of sustaining life
  with no off planet resources (it may not be pleasant, but it\'s
  possible - assuming the extended percentages for hydro as used
  in World Builder\'s Handbook (DGP for MT), i.e., hydro of 0
  means 5% of surface or less may be water.  That means that
  while trade is the lifeblood and defining characteristic of
  the Sylean Federation, I don\'t see it as requiring the
  traditional image of million-ton (disp.) freighters plying the
  space lanes - at least, not at this point in time.  Certainly,
  a 600-Td freighter won\'t be big enough for the majority of
  shipping, but I figure they should be a significant fraction,
  with the majority being perhaps corporate 10,000-to-50,000 Td
  freighters in the most well-developed lanes, and the smaller
  ships, down to free traders, handling the less well-developed
  areas, and the frontiers.  The farther away from the mains you
  go, the more ships you will find lower on the displacement
  scale. Thus, the clusters that are just off the mains will see
  mostly 1,000 to 10,000 Td cargo carriers of mixed ownership
  (government, corporate, and local), with 600s and smaller
  (primarily local ownership; some corporate) filling in the
  gaps locally. The frontiers will see primarily the 600s, with
  the Free Traders filling in the gaps. Most areas in the Deeps
  (parsecs outside the borders of the Federation, but still
  within reasonable commercial distance) will see the rare 600
  going to a developing market or trade hub, but will see almost
  universally the "tramp" Free Trader.

  (1) Question for discussion:  Are these reasonable assumptions?
  How long has the Sylean Federation been in existence, and is
  this long enough to have developed economical million-ton
  (disp) per shipment trade?

  Now, there are logically three broadly general classes of
  commerce - commodity trade, where large quantities of low-cost
  and/or consumable/disposable goods are shipped because it\'s
  cheaper than producing locally (example: machine parts on a
  world that doesn\'t have accessible ores); goods trade (can\'t
  think of a better name), where moderate quantities are shipped
  as an alternative to local production, because of perceived
  "cachet" or better quality (example: ground cars to a planet
  with a slightly lower TL); and luxury trade, where small
  quantities commanding high prices are shipped, because limited
  quantities of the good are available, or there is limited
  source, or anything else that might make something command a
  high price (example: garments made of the fur of an animal
  that only lives in one system in the subsector - or the fur
  itself, to be made into garments at destination).

  (2) Question for discussion:  Am I talking through my hat here,
  or is this reasonable?  What kinds of goods would you put in
  each category?

  Broadly speaking, I view the basic trade values in Traveller
  as referring to the goods trade; commodity trade will command
  lower prices at both ends; luxury trade will command higher
  prices at both ends.

  (3) Question for discussion:  Is this reasonable?  What should
  the base values be?  Should there be a price modifier on goods
  that require special handling (toxic, radioactive, fragile,
  etc.) or special environments (live animals, etc.)?

  (4) Question for discussion:  What else should affect the
  price of goods, at either end?

  I\'m posting this to both the TML and the GDW-beta lists
  because I want as many people as possible to think about this;
  I think that discussion is better carried out on the GDW-beta
  list.  If Rob wants to allow it on the TML, I\'m willing - I
  monitor both lists (and the XTML as well).

  *Note for those who haven\'t figured it out already from my
  past posts: In spite of the fact that it\'s different from the
  "standard" on these lists, I use the following long forms and
  abbreviations: Traveller (T) refers to the Imperium Games
  release.  Classic Traveller (CT) refers to the original GDW
  release - the little black books all the way through Deluxe
  Traveller (boxed set) and The Traveller Book.  MegaTraveller
  (MT) refers to the second GDW release, under that name.
  Traveller: The New Era (T:TNE) is the final GDW release, under
  that name.

Remember, the "size" of a minature is supposed to be the height of an
average person *in scale*.

1:120 |	13mm	13mm	14mm	14mm	14mm	15mm	15mm

Glance over the chart and see what the possible heights of a given size
figure are then look at the corresponding scale. I think you\'ll find
that most figures are *intended* to be 5\'8" to 6\'. 54mm fits, and I
know that was a popular "show" scale for Napoleonics. I think 48mm
miniatures exist, though I wouldn\'t swear to it. And 25 and 115 mm fit
ok. 20 mm kinda fits, and 30 mm (if such exist) also kinda fits.

The real problem is that for the most part the manufacturers *don\'t*
use a uniform scale. If they did, then you could complain about the
scale of the figures being off.

So, should someone happen to have sensors aimed in the general direction
of the ship, as this happens, will the decompression affect signature?

     An eplosion is unlikely if proper saftey measures are taken as there
will be no spark to start the fire. Most computers in traveller a fiberoptic
and don\'t have the capacity to create a spark. (however a person running
their fingers through their har will generate enough static that should they
groung them selves BOOM!!!) The person working in engineering on the other
hand is now a popscicle in the extreme. As I understand it most of the
drives are run on hydrogen, and liquid h2 is bad news for a ship crew not
just due to the fact that it is highly volitole but it is also very cold an
dwill cause problems with other systems. If you are rumming a fiberoptic
computer you have just flash frozen all of the controll links to the reactor
(this will most liklely cause an emegency shut down of the drives) causing a
massive power spike (enough to blow out the light bulbs).

      The drive is indeed going to taper off but not before it spikes if you
aren\'t sure of this shut off an out of tune deisel engine and give it a
listen. If the safty interlocks are working their will be a nice gentle
taper. However if they should happen to fail (due to being frozen because of
the liquid hydrogen) their will be a spike first.

      Only that there will be a large amount of toxic coolant and harmfull

this should make any clean-up operation loads of fun by requiring them to

   P.S. Ifo you have a big boom thats it the whole ship is gone the
Atmosphere will combine with the hydrogen and the ship will be no more. Look

While it is possible to imagine that a catastrophe would have a major impact
(imagine thermonuclear war on North America for example), I always thought that
T:TNE accepted that some planets would be less hit than others (hence pocket 
empires).  I can also accept that a large portion of the population would 
suffer greatly (remember the telephone sanitizers...), people like engineers
would keep their knowledge and be able to reproduce it.  Computer technicians 
might dissapear, but miners would still continue to mine and people would 
find way to reproduce their technology.  Remember, they can take all their 
time, they live to be 200+ years old after all!

My greatest problem comes from their lack of political unity.  We must remember
that this is a race that is used to living together in one political system.  
They wouldn\'t just go their separate ways.

Yup.  Oven cleaner, according to Mike Cheney the modelling master at Sci-Fi

whole miniature.  He said that it won\'t destroy detail.

25m is the distance from the feet to the eyes, not the top of the head. 
(Measured this way so you don\'t have to worry about headgear.)  Now, while
that holds true for my Rafm and Ral Partha historicals, their fantasy and
role-playing lines are closer to 30mm from feet to eyes.  

Now, when I look at the figures that came with my 1/72 model tanks and
airplanes, they look really wimpy beside my 25mm historicals, let alone my
fantasy figures.

To be honest, I usually _draw_ my deckplans at 25mm = 2m (or 1"=6\' for space
1889), because it\'s easier.

Rafm sells by mail order, too.  In fact, judging by the postal dates, I think
they have same-day service for shipping.  (I post my order on Wednsday, I
have it next Tuesday!)

They are also willing to mix-and-match figures, if your order is large
enough.  (I wanted some specific figures for a class project.)  Their
historical miniatures (eg. British infantry) run at less than 75 cents each. 
And their Traveller ships have recently come down in price!

OK, I admit I like their sculptors\' style, but they are also _very_
reasonable in price, and very accomodating people.  (And looking for a
sculptor, if you want some work...)

Thanks for the reply.  I must first tell you that I really was impressed
by the work you did.  I know I wouldn\'t have done it and I have been playing
with Traveller since it was only three booklets... (This is starting to sound
like: I\'d like to go out with you but... ;-#))

I am surprised however by your comment concerning the number of D6.  I know what
the rules say... I am asking (indirectly I guess) question about the rules 
themselves.  Remember that the designers themselves admitted \'fudging\' the
rolls when they generated the Solomani Rim in the first place.  They just
wanted a place that had a more realistic feel to it (I am quoting from memory - I
might be wrong).  Remember the difference between the Core sector and the 
Solomani Rim sector?  Someone remarked some time ago in a Challenge magazine 
that they felt differently.  The designers admitted then that one sector was random 
while the other one wasn\'t.  The use of generic rules mean that they might not adapt
to specific circumstances.  As I mentioned in another reply \'While it is possible 
to imagine that a catastrophe would have a major impact (imagine thermonuclear war 
on North America for example), I always thought that T:TNE accepted that some planets 
would be less hit than others (hence pocket empires).  I can also accept that a large

time, they live to be 200+ years old after all!\'

I understand that we cannot reproduce in a game the full effects of a catastrophe of that
proportion.  Even your work, while listing how many billions of people died, fails to 
carry this information (the mind just cannot comprehend numbers like these).  However, in
order to remain playable, the game must make some transgressions with realism.  I understand
your position and respect it, it does not diminish the quality of the work you produced, 
I just dispute some of the facts behind your decisions.

I think this is a fair assumption considering the state of the universe in 
T:TNE.  The game assumes that the universe continued, at least in some locations.  
It would take only one Vegan planet (or community) to continue and spread.  If they
were to appear on a diminished (collapsed) world, they could build upon the local 
knowledge, some type of intellectual domino effect.  This is an advantage if you live to
be 200+.  On the other hand, a human ship arriving on a collapse world with a 
population would have to build from the ground up.  The knowledge having
all disappeared.  I must add that my assumption is not that wrong since some planets 
in the T:TNE universe still have billions of inhabitants.  You can only achieve these
numbers with some technology.  Once more, it would be easier to build from the ground
up with people who have retained the knowledge.

Even if they couldn\'t do anything with that knowledge, the hatred would still
be there and would reflect in any dealings with humans associated with solomanis.  
How long did it take the U.S. South to stop hating the yankees (if
ever).  Some veterans wrote of doing their service in the South (before WWII) 
and their units were booed.  Only with the advent of Pearl Harbor did it change.
And we are a short lived race (in comparison to the Vegans of course, not the common
house fly :-#)).  The situation in the Balkans is another example.  In a slow changing
society (I am assuming that a long lived society would be slow in changing, at least
socially), the feelings would be even more present.  It would be as strong in the first 
(or second) generation.

To clarify, I did not invent that ship, nor it\'s name. I built a QSDS
version of a ship that had appeared in the old FAR TRAVELLER magazine from
FASA. (I had a photocopy of the ship and it\'s deck plans).

        Well, you can\'t. However, in the archive on Joe Heck\'s web page,
there is an Adobe Acrobat file called SSDS (Standard Ship Design System),
the "big brother" of the QSDS. It doesn include such rules, as well as being
somewhat more detailed. With this and a little interpolation, you could
build virtually any ship. It is very likely (although this is only my
opinion) that this could be the system we\'ll see in STARSHIPS as the
"intermediate" system between QSDS and FF&S. I know I intend to use it until
STARSHIPS comes out.

Have you thought about Napoleon also?  His coming to power in the wake (is this the 
right word?  I am french canadian) of the troubles in revolutionnary France could give
us a good idea not only of one man taking absolute power but also the beginning of 
nobility.

For a long time, Napoleon referred to himself as the Emperor of the Republic of France??!!
The National Assembly remained and even kept some powers.  I think it would be interesting 
to hear from someone who is better than me in french history and to draw some comparisons...

They\'d most likely be installed in obscure sections of the engineering
area, where theres a lot of machinery, etc between you and a normal
exit.  Probably a small open booth which closes automatically.  The idea
is that in some cases there may be a few seconds of time between the
alarm and evacuation.  Also, if the LHyd lines let go and you know
you\'ll soon be sucking vacuum, it might seem like a nice idea,
particualarly if the leak\'s between you and normal exit.  This makes
more sense than some adventures I\'ve read (or was it CT?) which implied
that on decompression you could get in a vacc suit if you\'re quick and
lucky.

Of course, this falls into the same catagory of \'give the crew a secure
feeling\' that escape trunks on submarines are in.  Nice in theory, but
useful only if the conditions are just right.

Yeah, I remember sub escape training.  I also remember the guy who
thought saying \'ho, ho, ho\' on the way up was a joke and said something
else.  Let\'s just say the divers doing the training didn\'t see the humor
and made sure he didn\'t forget it. ;-)

Is there any _real_ info on decompression survivability?

travel time between comets if one of them is not enough to refuel your
fleet. (assume Haley\'s comet is average - further assume it is 3/4 ice -
Does anybody know where or how to find out it\'s mass ??) 
   For a small fleet one comet should suffice, but then why not bring along
a tanker?

   If your going to take a J1 jump to the inner system, and you are setting
up your stagging base more than 3/4 a light year out to avoid detection,
send in your survey teams 15 to 20 months in advance to either find that
comet/fuel supply, or set up a fuel depot where you can ship fuel in and
store it.

   These strategy notes aside, you don\'t need HEPlaR drives.   A one gee
drive operating at 1 percent efficiency will still generate a respectable
velocity vector over time. (or even 0.01 percent.)  So, it takes you a day
and a half to complete a maneuver that at full rating would only take 1/2 a
hour.  It is not like your power plant, (which is fueled for a year), is
going to run dry.

OK, money where my mouth is. <g>  I\'ll work chapter 3 first.  Who wants

        I agree ... in fact I\'ve felt that officers should rise from the
ranks since I first read "Starship Troopers!" \'Course, that\'s a bit
hypocritical of me, considering I chose not to rise from the ranks, but ...

        Anyway, I just wanted to point out there\'s justification for people
who are used to Traveller being more closely aligned with the culture that
created the game.

        Ahhh, but would ships moving in to attack a calibration point not
have HEPlaR? In fact, the more I think about it off the top of my pointy
head, the more I think MOST warships will have HEPlaR auxiliary drives. The
main tplates are fine and dandy because they don\'t take fuel. But if you
want to add an extra OOMPH, HEPlaR drives themselves are very small. So you
burn some of your jumpfuel. I can see most warships with 3-5G Tplates, and a
multi-G HEPlaR booster for when they really want to cook with gas ...

        Have you talked to this family member in the business about getting
a few things printed up? I\'d personally be interested in:

        A set of LARGE starfield hexmaps (about 3/4" hexes) that can be
butted up next to each other to create a truly humongous playing field (I
think BL misses half the flavor, starting out at such close ranges)

        Likewise a set of large white hexmaps, useful for drawing
landscapes, etc. on.

        Ditto a set of large gridmaps (about 1/2" grid).

        Ditto likewise a map of the Imperium.

        Anybody else got any suggestions?

He he he he. One of the more memorable moments in my last campaign came
when, during a mis-jump, one of the crew of a Free Trader had to crawl out
to conduct an emergency repair. The grid was glowing\', and the one-meter
"shell" was holdin\'... until the PC noticed that the field was warping
towards her as she crawled over the hull. (She was blocking the grid).

Nothing came of it...except she completed her EVA a LOT faster than she
would have otherwise. It made for some nice, tense moments.

I used to game with a guy who had completed his nuclear power tech training
in the navy before being medically discharged.  He had some wonderful
horror stories about what a steam leak can do to a person - it\'s coming out
under very high pressure.  According to him, if they suspect a steam leak,
they proceed carefully through the engineering spaces, waving a broom up
and down in front of them.  When the invisible steam jet cuts the broom
handle in half, you\'ve found your leak

_Executive Orders_, and it is in the Jack Ryan timeline.

Recently I saw someone post that they had created their own traveller
minis.  I thought I saved the message, but...

Anyway, would the miniature creator please send me email?

community has a better idea - simply refer to things by their scale.  Our
use of mm height to denote scale is traditional but highly inaccurate -
witness another previous post where somebody (sorry - I forget who)
commented that 25mm figs went well with 1/48th scale models.  My initial
reaction was "baloney" until I checked the sizes of some of my "25s" and
realized they were BIG - between 30 and 35mm and within a few percent of
1/48th scale (about 1/53rd, actually)!  

Of course, if manufacturers referred to things by scale, they\'d be setting
themselves up for all sorts of critical examination because everybody could
measure the scale the same way...  Merrick earlier mentioned that he
dislikes (GW) oversculpted big 25s - I agree.  Aside from the oversculpting,
they\'re not 25s.  If figures were scaled instead of millimetered, GWs "25s",
instead of being nominally 1/72nd scale or 1/64th scale, or whatever scale
one comes up with based on how one measures figures, would, using a notional
six-foot rule, simply be to an entirely different scale.

The thing is that they are refering to it by a scale.  Any 2 25mm
figures should, within individual human variation, be in the same
scale.  They aren\'t.  The people who make \'em are sloppy.  Man, I
*hate* slop.

[rant off]

I haven\'t even bought a figure in years (aside from spacecraft minis
for TNE).  Bashing military figures from models works better, IMO.
While I see why they don\'t wanna get into scale arguements, it is
possible to sculpt good figures.  It is also possible to make good
resin castings that aren\'t full of bubbles----it\'s just that they
don\'t bother, and no one cares :-/

Next time you see a resin cast of less than 50 pieces that has *any*
bubbles in it *and* costs more than $50 (less if it has fewer
pieces) you are being treated like a sucker.

I\'d say retail resin (<25g) stuff should go for ~$2 per piece, no bubbles.
Unless it\'s insanely complicated, then ~$3 a piece. ***Resin casting 
rant off now, as well***

Sorry, I went to the SF/comics/games store and saw some crappy ST resin 
models today for ~$50 that had 5-6 pieces, none of which would have made 
it past the trash can in my shop.  Again, I hate slop.

Got "Helium" and "Ammonia" wrong.  Among these --

- - Helium is chemically neutral, and not likely to be found in quantity 
aboard a starship.

- - Hydrogen, though it can act as an oxidant, more commonly acts as a
reducing agent (electron donor) in reactions.  I agree with most
discussion so far on the effects of a big internal LHyd leak, though there
wouldn\'t be enough of it to flash-freeze more than the immediate environs
of the tanks and engine room.  Explosion is really the main danger. 

- - Nitrogen (in its common diatomic form, N2) is very nearly chemically 
inert.  There would be lots of it on board -- 4/5 of the breathing air 
mix, if they use Earth-equivalent cabin atmosphere -- but it would have 
no special harmful effects in an accident.

- - Ammonia is a weak base (proton acceptor), and a very mild reducing
agent.  It\'s also moderately toxic to humans.  I can\'t imagine why there\'d
be much of it on a ship, nor would it be outlandishly harmful if it were
there.

- - Lithium is a waxy solid.  It\'s a very strong reducing agent -- so 
strong it actually explodes on contact with water!  (I had hours of fun 
doing this in I-chem lab).  Being a solid, though, its potential for 
disaster is relatively reduced (pardon the pun), and also I can\'t think 
why much of it would be on a ship.

Not an oxidizing agent in the bunch. :)

My view of an LHyd internal leak is that the supreme Bad Effect,
outweighing all others, would be the explosion as H2 and O2 met, fell in
love, and decided to have lots of cute little H2O\'s together.  Note,
however, that while this would be an *extreme* fire hazard (setting lots
of little fires in hard-to-reach places, and perhaps spewing toxic smoke
from burning insulation et al), it would *not* in all likelihood breach
the hull.  H2-O2 explosions don\'t make much of a pressure wave, as the
reaction products take up much less volume than the reagents. 
Compartments into which LHyd directly leaked would also get the Big Chill
effect.

Note that the fragile external skeleton of the H. is visibly *still 
intact* through most of the first minute of burning.  Not much of a 
pressure wave, as I said.  Just a whole lotta flame.

When you read the rhetoric of those eras (say 1540 AD to 1116 IE), you\'re
not supposed to believe it.  Compare what was done with what was said.
"Saving their souls"; "protecting them from [pick one:]  A. warlike

I\'m not saying that life under a corrupt noble might not be a better choice

I think we\'re in agreement:  Nobles\' violent and thieving tendencies are
best focussed outward as much as possible

Again, we\'re in agreement.  It\'s no fun to play, and it\'s not realistic, if
everything is corrupt (it might be realistic in certain settings, like the
USSR under Stalin, but definitely not fun to play).

I think that you and Stu and I agree that there is human variation in
values, attitudes, and ethics.  Nobles are not like other citizens in terms
of range of behavior, however.  Nobles have much more power than anyone
else, and are therefore not as constrained by fear in when they act.  So
while anyone might have violent, thieving tendencies, nobles can put a gloss
of legitimacy on their violence and theft.

For example, Joe Citizen, UPP 777777, runs a big risk by robbing a bank, or
running a protection racket in his neighborhood, or even joining the
military, where violence is strictly constrained by discipline, and theft
usually discouraged (depending on the circumstances; sometimes soldiers have
been paid entirely in booty).  He\'s looking at time or worse.

Joseph von Hochplatz, UPP 77777C, however, can get government approval,
funding, and military support to destroy the ecosystem and local culture of
an entire world while extracting raw materials and pocketing the profit.  He
can even defraud the government, his investors, and his insurers, and, with
good lawyers and accountants (which he can afford), make the trail so
convoluted that it\'s so hard to prove that he did anything wrong that his
offer of settlement will be accepted.  He\'ll never see the inside of a cell;
rather, he\'ll be feted, admired, and solicited to apply his expertise to the
destruction of the next world.

you point out yourself that the nobles\' energies will be directed outward
during times of expansion, and that makes perfect sense:  why destroy and
steal from your own home when you can destroy and steal from someone else\'s,
and take the plunder home to enjoy?

As someone without any military experience (hell, I went to a Quaker
college), I don\'t want actually join this entertaining and enlightening
discussion.  As a former history major and graduate student, however, I
would point out that, as far as I know, there was neither a USMC nor USN nor
any precursor to them in 1696, nor until about 80 years thereafter.
Accordingly, it appears that the Marines\' gate-guarding record only extends
for just over 200 years.

A professional diver who was a neighbor of mine once said that drowning
wasn\'t that bad an experience if there\'s no hope of surviving.  The drowning
person accepts the process and swallows water, which triggers a relaxation
response and the panic goes away.  People resist drowning if they think they
have a chance, and that\'s quite a horrible way to go.

As far as revival possibilities, the faster the drowning and the colder the
water the better.  

He said that the drowning scene in The Abyss was quite realistic.  We didn\'t
talk about WWII submarine movies.

He had never drowned, but had studied it and had talked with other divers
who had drowned.

Warfare is about siezing objectives from the enemy. The way this has been 
done has changed a lot since the days of the massed cavelry charge. Why?

Technolagy.

In the Napolionic era, muskets and cannons where not that accurate, so to 
achieve the best effect, you grouped them togetther and fire them at once.
Thus you have large ranks of men and large batteries. Cavelry was seen a 
shock troops, but in reality where little morr than fart scirmishers.

In WWI, artillery and personal weapons increased in both accuracy and 
lethality. 1 squad of machinegunners could wipe out a napolionic line in 
minutes, while artillery could kill more for less shot (napolionic shot 
tended to roll on the ground after a while, and their angle of launch was 
preatty low compared to howitzers and other altillery peaces of WW1). 
Massed lines of troups where still used in attack, mainly because of 
conserative leadership and the fact that the best way to overcome strong 
defence was to overwealm it. The tank was introduced in this piriod, and 
while not as stunning as it will be in WWII, it still had conciderable 
impact in terms of "getting there first with the mostest"

WWII saw a more fluid war that WWI, due to better transport technolagy 
and better equipment technolagy. The ammount of people you needed in 
attacks was less than before, as the persoanl and support weapons had 
improved, but more importantly, the tactical and stradagic thinking had 
caught up with the technolagy.

In Traveller, a marince SQUAD would bedressed in a battle dress with more 
punch and defence than a Platoon of M1A2 tanks. Faster too, with 
augumented exoframes and jump packs. Plasma , laser and battlefield level 
nukes (grenade size or equivelent).The line between tank and attack 
aircraft (and battleship for that matter) is blurred out to wazoo. 
Comuter and navigaional aids would be at a persoanl level, not squad or 
platoon level as it is today. 

Where in Napolionic wars, the field of battle would be able to be seen 
with the naked eye, in Traveller , whole contenants would be contested at 
a tactical level. 

Why am I Saying this : In Year 0 , there is only one kid on the block 
with Tl12 toys, Sylea. A platoon of marines can and would chew up whole 
armies at TL4, whole brigades in Tl5-8, and whol regiments at Tl10. 

This has BEVER been addressed in traveller (a friend of mine keeps saying 
that in Traveller, you are always refighting WW2). What do you guys think?

talking about, and for exactly the reasons that Darryl mentions.  Simple
application of the weapons and capabilities of high tech troops
immediately leads to very different tactics than those employed by 20th
century Earth troops.

        I\'ll take a stab at this:

1) if you were wearing a vac suit capable of maintaining life support for
the week or so passed in jump space, immediately polarized your face plate
to complete opacity, and spent the entire week sticking to the hull like a
roach on a wall, you might a) not asphyxiate, b) remain inside the ship\'s
jump bubble and not go insane from the deleterious effects of jump space on
the brain.  Since under the MT rules a TL-14 vac suit has a max endurance
of 48 hrs or so IIRC, you probably would run out of air before reemergence.

        With regard to B), on the other hand, there\'s Grandfather only
knows how many gigavolts/gigaamps/insane amounts of electricity getting
pumped into the hull grid.  I get the impression that you\'d go zot like a
fly on a bug-zapper, only much worse.  This might cause the ship to misjump
in interesting ways (which could make a useful plot hook...).  OTOH, you
could also handwave that that power is all going into creating the rip into
jump space rather than merely discharging normally, thereby letting you
survive.

2) What you saw: under our house rules, all ports are covered over before
jump and remain so until after reemergence, because looking into jump space
is bad for your sanity.  Therefore nothing, unless you like playing
severely mentally ill characters :).

What you felt (unless you were wearing a *very* advanced vac suit): extreme
discomfort as you were living in a vac suit for a week or so: waste
collection systems being pushed to their limits (bigtime yuck), chafing on
pressure points, your own stale sweat and fear stink overloading the air
scrubber (let alone the smells from the overloaded waste system), muscle
pains from spending all that time lying spreadeagled on the hull so as to
keep your anatomy within the jump bubble, that sort of thing.

        It\'s not something I\'d want to try :).
