        My take on sandcasters vs lasers is as follows: given that this is
space combat, taking place over huge distances, with combatants travelling
at fairly high speeds, all a sandcaster gunner does is periodically fire a
canister of sand placed such that it will remain between the combatants on
their projected trajectory for as long as possible.  Split-second
close-range dogfighting =E0 la Star Wars or Star Trek just isn\'t going to be
happening, and changing course will be difficult (I\'d highly recommend
sitting down with Microsoft Space Simulator to get a visceral sense for
this) and long-term once the combatants have been accellerating for a
while.  Therefore, each ship will be able to plot its adversaries probable
motions into the short-term future, and placing a canister such that it\'ll
catch incoming laser fire shouldn\'t be difficult.

        With regards to missiles, this is a no-brainer; use the sandcaster
like a shotgun, using the missile\'s own kinetic energy to kill it with
multiple small impacts.

        Something that has occurred to me is that sandcasters would be very
effective at discouraging longterm pursuit; you don\'t want to be constantly
accellerating after something while flying through clouds of grit... it\'d
be kinda suicidal.  Same goes for rapidly closing attackers; a can of sand
could at the least trash all unarmoured equipment on the outside of the
hull.

        It also occurs to me that this might explain why fighters are
supposed to be the Third Imperium\'s main advantage; they can overwhelm the
target ship\'s sandcaster batteries by presenting lasers firing from
multiple points.  They can get around the walls the sandcasters throw up,
and unless the target has a _lot_ of sandcasters, tracking a bunch of say
20 fighters, placing clouds of sand between the target and each fighter\'s
trajectory within the fighter\'s lethal radius is going to be difficult,
especially as the fighters have 6G\'s or so of delta V; start firing
sandcasters too early and the fighters will simply change their
trajectories so that they travel past the cloud and fire unobscured.  OTOH,
too late and they get some shots off... but yet again OTOH, they\'d make
good anti-fighter defenses; a fast pass through a cloud of sand would
probably cramp a fighter\'s style some.

        Actually, the more I think about it the more I think that
Sandcasters are interesting weapons systems.  Lots of implications, not the
least of which would be that firing them off in traffic lanes is probably
illegal :).  Spent sand would be a helluva space junk hazard...

(or whatever the correct stats as given in CT are)  It doesn\'t seem
like there is much room for creativity there.  

What I would suggest is that we make up TL-12 ships that accomplish the
same task, ie in the case of the Merc Cruiser carrying a small group of
mercenaries to their destination and landing them.  

As for suggestions for which ships to make. I thought that IG was
redoing many of the ships in Starships, so that they actually follow
the rules.   But I guess we can do the same.  I would suggest redoing
the small craft first. They are most obviously broken.  Its a real
challenge making small craft below TL-12, because Fusion plants are so
big.  You really have to use Fission, or fuel cells.  You certainly can
not make the Tl-9 4G ships that are in Starships.  

I\'d vote for redoing the Heavy Fighter from Starships.

I wouldn\'t be suprised that it doesn\'t actually add up.  It was one of
the few ships that isn\'t obviously broken.  The 10 ton fighter, with 10
tons of fuel, is the most obvious example.  :( Don seemed to just put
stats out of the air for the ships. :(

Description: The Proton motorcycle is powered by a 1.0MW fusion+
power plant. This immense power plant gives the Proton a top speed
surpassed only by gravitic vehicles.  The Proton carries no cargo
and is intended purely for pleasure driving.
     A transparent canopy encloses the rider. Without this, wind drag
would make the Proton impossible to control.  The Proton is equipped with
a multi-channel radio capable of communicating with up to 11 other vehicles.
This allows several Protons riders to talk while whizzing down the road.
The Proton features a 10km sensor suite capable of full night vision.
This system is essential to the Proton, at speeds of 700kph, you have
to know what\'s coming otherwise, you\'ll find out by crashing into it.
In case of a catastrophic accident, an optional ejection seat is 
available.   
      All Protons are available with Verotech\'s patented Smart Paint
system. This allows the owner to specify any sort of decorative pattern
or actual picture.  Many owners have several designs programed and actually
switch between designs while driving, as a means of communicating with other
vehicles.

I vaguely recall reading in the hardback edition of the C.T. rules, that
the particles in a sandcaster canister are composed of a substance
similiar to the active ingredient in ablative body armor ("ablat").
Perhaps this is a stupid idea, but why not just put a laser-resistant
ablative layer right on the ship\'s hull, rather than flinging it out into
space?

"Judging" from the b&w of the Patrol Cruiser in MMT4, which is captioned as
400 tons, and the preceding UPP which is labeled and described as 200
tons...  I think it might bear some looking over; I have not run the
numbers, yet... though I recall it *always* being 400 tons...  But, I vote

From the rest of your message, it appears that you\'re asking about the
personal-scale and vehicle-scale weapon design sequences.  The Naval
Architects\' Handbook (at least as envisioned by Dave and the Beta list) will
no longer contain design sequences for these items.

Greg Porter created the T4 personal weapons, personal armor, and vehicle
design systems, and is the author of the _Emperor\'s Arsenal_ book (scheduled
to be published later this month by IG).  The Emperor\'s Arsenal should be a
112-page book.  Here\'s a "sneak preview" of some of the weapons:

Name                Penetration   TL  Range    Shots  Mass    Reload   Cost

Laser ACR-14         6            14  Long     50     4.5kg   1.7kg    Cr5200

Greg\'s own game company, BTRC (Blacksburg Tactical Research Center) publishes
a design system called _Guns, Guns, Guns_ (3G3) that (in it\'s latest edition)
can be used to design weapons for T4 (appropriate rules are included with 3G3);
more information is available from BTRC\'s web page, which is located at
    http://members.aol.com/btrc/ 

The NAH will include design sequences for spacecraft weapons, and will
probably incorporate some changes to those design sequences.

_Starships_ is unfortunately not a good source of examples for either ship
design system.  It\'s likely that the ship you are looking at (particularly
if it has no design credit) was designed using the TLAR ("That Looks About
Right") system, rather than SSDS and QSDS.

If you have any particular questions about starship design, I\'ll be happy to
answer them.

I\'ll go with the Merc Cruiser ... but it\'s worth noting that the classic
version of this ship is 800dt.  Here\'s a shot at some specifications:

o Transport and deliver to an on-world combat area some number (I forget
  exactly, I don\'t have my references here at work, and besides we can ha=

  this be one of the parameters that varies with each design) of light
  troops and their equipment (cargo space should be provided for equipmen=

  The troops may not be Marines, so drop capsules cannot be used to deliv=

  them to the world\'s surface.  If small craft are to be used, the cost o=

  the craft should be included in the cost of the design.
o Provide command-and-control facilities for the embarked unit.
o Provide ortillery (orbital artillery) fire support to the embarked unit.
o Provide basic support functions for the embarked unit.
o Provide adequate self-defense against enemy starships of approximately
  the same size class.

I concur with the Mercenary Cruiser suggestion.  However, I don\'t think w=
e
should specify to the degree of "800 ton" (or 600, depending on your
reading of the rules and history) ship: part of the charm of the recent
TML contest was the range of sizes and capabilities that came up.  It
would be interesting to see, say, a dirt-cheap bunk-equipped transport fo=
r
a battalion of infantry, compared to a highly-tuned fighter- and tank-
carrying spinal-mount-equipped menace carrying only a small cadre force.=20
Some ships might be designed to be deployed in groups (sold to larger mer=
c
companies desiring high configurability, or to colonial forces), while
others would be an all-in-one high-value egg-basket.

While I\'m at it, will there be a February TML Challenge?  We\'ve done
artwork for the main rulebook, starship design inspired by the second
publication...  looks to me like it\'s time either for a VDS design contes=
t
(now that CSC is out) or, in a much "fuzzier" vein, though giving a much
different feel and probably attracting a much different audience, an alie=
n
design competition to describe a new minor race in the style of AA.

What d\'ya say, Joe?

Sandcasters fire a "can" of highly refractive particles, coloquially call=
ed
"sand" by spacers.  When the enemy laser beam hits these particles, some
of the energy is dispersed via refraction.  The particles can\'t handle th=
e
intensity of a weapon-grade laser beam for long, and eventually vaporise
(using up more the energy of the enemy\'s shot) until finally the enemy
laser "burns through" the sand cloud.

> How do they detect the incoming laserbeam?

Nothing quite so complicated as your suggestions.  Space combat turns are
long (in the T4 basic starship combat, they\'re 10 minutes; in the highly
recommended Role-Playing Space Combat system, they\'re 30 minutes).

Laser weapons are assumed to be firing continously during that time; spac=
e
combat ranges are so great (and the uncertainty of the target\'s position =
and
motion are large enough) that most of these shots miss.  Even in space, a
near miss can be detected several ways by the target ship.  This will all=
ow
the target to get a \'can\' of sand in the way of the next shot.  The (slig=
ht)
possibility that the laser will hit with the first pulse is ignored by th=
e
sandcaster rules, in the interest of simplicity.

> 1) They are in fact a passive defence.

It should be possible to use sand this way, but there
are currently no rules for doing so.

> 2) Laser weapons require the target to be illuminated by a lower power

Any weapon that\'s controlled by a Master Fire Director (MFD; in QSDS, all
"military" weapon systems use MFDs) does indeed have a targetting (laser =
or
radar) beam.  Detecting this beam would certainly alert a ship that it wa=
s
under attack, and give an indication of the right direction to launch the
sand.

> 3) Sandcasters have some form of FTL detection apperatus

Definitely not.

You are exacly right. There is no way that ablative sand could ever be
more effective than ablative armor, and there are lots of problems that
will make ablative sand FAR inferior to ablative armor.

The one advantage I can think of that sand may have is of refraction and
light scattering. If the sand is far enough away from the ship, the
scattering of the laser beam at small angles will tend to diffuse the
beam, rendering it harmless. This is something that armor cannot do.
This may, in fact, be a substantial advantage; in my campaign, I use
this explanation for how sand works against lasers.

Against missiles, I say it works like our modern day CIWS phalanxes,
merokas, etc.

Not a bad thought to use against fighters at close quarters, but I\'m not =
sure
that the particles would be strong enough to cause damage compared to the
strength of a starship hull.  MT gave sandcasters a penetration of 20 aga=

ground targets as compared to the standard armor value of an unarmored
starship, which I believe to be 40.  This wouldn\'t be enough to make any

damage over several battles to warrant hull repairs.

Within the control system of the sandcaster, there is a predictive
targeting system that feeds from the sensor array. This tries to "reverse
engineer" the target solution that the enemy vessel will be generating,
using the knowledge of where vessel is going, and running a modified lase=
r

backwards?!

I think that the distances, speeds etc. mess up the target beam idea. (I

you already have FTL-comm in your campaign).

Any weapon is directed by the sensors of the battery firing it; with
stellar-tech targeting computers, it ought to be easy to detect and
anticipate the arrival of the weapon by detecting the signature of the
beam pointer. In the case of active sensors, you have the signature of
the sensors themselves, in which case it should come as no surprise that
YOU ARE ABOUT TO GET SHOT AT. In the case of passive sensors, you can
pick up the arrival of the missiles optically from the IR sig, and
lasers simply get intercepted just AFTER they arrive and are buried
under tons of refractive debris before they can do anything more than
leave scorch marks on the paint.

If that still doesn\'t satisfy your sense of realism, just say that ALL
weapons systems \'sample\' the target just a few milliseconds prior to
impact. Lasers would scan the target with a very quick lo-intensity beam
prior to cranking up the power enough to do damage, while even
passive-guidance missiles would be assumed to carry some sort of
terminal guidance sensor that would do the same thing.

This is a game. It is a game involving bullshittium technologies that
are extrapolations of extrapolations of educated-to-wild guesses. I can
whip up three or four realistic-sounding entries for the Unified Theory
Of Bullshittium Point Defenses just off the top of my head, and so can
anybody else. As long as we maintain a reasonable degree of internal
consistency, WE CAN DO WHATEVER WE WANT TO. My ultimate advice is to
simply make something up that sounds OK to you, and don\'t let anybody
indignantly insist that it\'s not \'realistic\' enough.

	This points out another VERY large advantage...this lets you SEE
the lasers that are being fired at you. Remember...lasers in a vaccuum ar=

reflective/refractive particles out there would serve the same function a=

fog machines at a concert...it really enhances the visibility of the
lasers in the light show.

	This leads to another conclusion, namely, that there are probably
at least two kinds of sandcaster charges available, tracking and
protective. tracking will spread out to a large cloud which will alow
rapid tracking as the beams pass through, followed by the protective
canisters, which would be deployed in a denser cloud closer to the ship.

(Luwas, Tsefe, and Drummond, Naval Architects) was called upon to attempt
to untangle the existing plans and specifications, remaining as close as
possible to what remained of the original design.  Below is our corrected
design prospectus for the Battle-class Imperial Destroyer.

LTD CFO Joseph Lockett notes that, for local production at least, he woul=

"is for swatting flies or swingeing gnats, not for bringing true Imperial
power to bear on pirates or foreign aggressors."  A fast courier has been
dispatched to Imperial Navy Headquarters on Sylea with LTD\'s findings.

Ship\'s Boat in Minimal Hangar                   10 Armor   18 Structure


    Battle-class Imperial Destroyers are named, reasonably enough, for
famous conflicts fought in Sylean, Solomani, and Vilani history: ships in
service include Agincourt, Abannol, Bunker Hill, Kamiiga, and Velpare.=20
The ship\'s jump range surpasses all Sylea\'s near neighbors\' capabilities,
and its 3G of continuous thruster-plate acceleration allow pursuit of mos=
t
targets.  Large fuel scoops allow full refuelling from wilderness sources
in one hour, and the onboard purification plant can process a full load i=
n
a mere six, allowing fast turnaround for patrols or pickets.  The ship\'s
panoply of weapons allows a wide range of response to provocations, and
several Imperial Marines are aboard, to serve as boarding parties or
elements of a prize crew.  The boat hangar may be reconfigured to carry
one or two of Sylea\'s prized space fighters, though the marine contingent
would then be forced to make ship-to-ship transfers in vacuum.=20

     On-board accomodations are well-suited to long patrols.  All Naval
crew department heads receive private large staterooms (including office
space).  The remainder of the crew receive individual small staterooms,
except for the sixteen most junior members (usually members of the Gunner=
y
and Engineering departments), who must double up.  Some commentators have
remarked on the high-passage-quality space alloted to the onboard marine
detachment, but the bulk of it is alloted to training spaces to keep the
troops in fighting trim.  The marine accomodations also provide separate
mess and leisure facilities, since conflicts between the socially more
lofty Naval personnel and their more plebeian Marine crewmembers have
proved problematic on previous designs of vessel.=20

Could this be one of those cases where the "defense in depth" works better than
a thick wall?  Just throwing out an idea.

        Right; however, if you don\'t maneuver, the cloud will just travel

        Something else that ought to be looked into is the effect of sand

        Coolness...  Methinks that if we go with the Merc Cruiser I\'ll
simply repost these as the specs.  It\'ll save us some time.

        Well, basically, there are a few options; either spend a week
hashing out a statement of mission requirements before we get into the
design phase...  Or we can simply use the brief description in the T4
manual...  Or, if we go for the Merc Cruiser, Guy Garnett was kind enough
to send me a mission requirement that makes sense.

        And no; if you want to build a 1000td J3 G6 airframe needle for
lugging mercs about, go right ahead.  You will of course be judged by your
peers on the result :).

        Absolutely...  I\'d forgotten about specifying TL.  I\'ll do so when
I announce the design phase.  I think that as we\'re using T4, TL-12 should
be de rigeur...

No, only officers get to go to the cool, year-long course.  I tend to let my
players defienwhat happened during their carrers, guided by what skills they
ended up with.

If you want your Army First Sergeant to be a retired Commando, and he has
the skills to back it up, let him!

I won\'t comment on this other than to say that the Sylean (later, 
Imperial) military probably shouldn\'t be constrained to contemporary 
military methodologies.  Maybe it\'s wrong to have all Commandoes as 
graduates of Military Academies anyway, but I thought I\'d throw that 
thought out.

Both are probably examples of the editing problems in T4.  At any rate, 
I\'ve been told that the price of the cP003 is correct on p 80.  As for 
ammo costs, I\'ll put a system designed by Greg Porter for figuring ammo 
costs at the end of this message.


> 2/ When is the Milieu zero sourcebook coming out?

I have been told that it will begin shipping next week.


> More importantly, when is the Emperor`s Arsenal coming out?

As far as I know, it will begin shipping at the end of this month.


And now, the ammo cost system (which I understand will be in Emperor\'s 
Arsenal, although this is a beta test version which Greg came up with a 
few weeks ago, so it may be changed in the final volume).


Ammunition costs
================

None of the weapons in Traveller, Central Supply Catalog or Emporer\'s
Arsenal have ammunition mass and cost explicitly listed. Unless
characters are constructing an ammo dump or are so poor that reloads are
a major part of the budget, it shouldn\'t be a major concern. If you want
general guidelines on how much various reloads mass and cost, see below.

Mass - Ammunition is usually listed and sold in 50 round quantities. The
mass for one round is generally:
     
     ((Penetration + 1)/(13 - Penetration)-8))4 kilograms 

with a base minimum of:

     (Penetration/200)kg per round.


Because we don\'t actually expect you to figure this out every time, see
the following table:

(Figures are rounded to the nearest 2 digits or .1kg)

Pen.    Mass(50 Rds)   Pen.    Mass(10 Rds)   Pen.    Mass (1 Rd)
 1         .3kg         9          4.8kg       17        26kg
 2         .5kg        10           10kg       18        32kg
 3         .8kg        11           21kg       19        39kg
 4        1.0kg        12           44kg       20        47kg
 5        1.3kg        13           94kg       21        57kg
 6        2.4kg        14          124kg       22        68kg
 7        5.3kg        15          160kg       23        81kg
 8         11kg        16          200kg       24        95kg

Modifiers
APDS ammunition               x.5 mass
TL9+ ammunition (caseless)    x.5 mass
Rockets                       x1 mass (do not use caseless modifier on
                                 rockets)
HE ammunition                 x.5 mass
HEAP or HEDP ammunition       x.25 mass (use only one of HEAP or HE)
Multiple proj. (shotgun)      x2 mass
Guided weapon                 x2 mass

Example - Lets say you want 50 rounds of TL12 APDS ammunition with a
Penetration of 5. The base mass is 1.3kg, times .5 for APDS, and times
.5 again for TL9+ ammunition, for a total of .325kg, rounding to .3kg.

Example - You need to know how much each HEAP reload for a Penetration
27 TL8 cannon is. This is off the table so you have to figure it out.
The base mass is 150kg, times .25 for HEAP ammunition is 37.5kg,
rounding to 38kg.

Now, these don\'t exactly match the figures given for reloads for each
weapon in Emporer\'s Arsenal, but are close enough for most purposes. For
most applications, just use the mass of a listed weapon reload, since
when you are on the move, what you can transport is the important part.
On the other hand, if you are buying in bulk and want to ship or store
the stuff in a limited amount of volume, use the figures from this
table. Bulk ammunition has a mass of 3 metric tons per cubic meter for
shipping purposes.

Cost - Now this is more near and dear to most character\'s credit
accounts. The basic cost per round for most ammunition is ((Penetration
+ 2)/10)3 Cr per round. As for mass, you don\'t have to figure this out:

Pen.   Cost (50 Rds)      Pen.    Cost(10 Rds)      Pen.   Cost (1 Rd)
 1         Cr1.4           9         Cr13            17      Cr6.9
 2         Cr3.2           10        Cr17            18      Cr8.0
 3         Cr6.3           11        Cr22            19      Cr9.3 
 4         Cr11            12        Cr27            20      Cr11
 5         Cr17            13        Cr34            21      Cr12
 6         Cr26            14        Cr41            22      Cr14
 7         Cr36            15        Cr49            23      Cr16
 8         Cr50            16        Cr58            24      Cr18

Modifiers
Previous TL surplus ammo      x.25 cost (but makes weapon automatically
                                   unreliable)
APDS ammunition, TL8-         x6 cost
APDS ammunition, TL9+         x3 cost
TL9+ ammunition (caseless)    x2 cost
Rockets                       x4 cost (do not use caseless modifier on
                                 rockets)
HE ammunition                 x3 cost 
HEAP or HEDP ammunition       x5 cost (use only one of HE or HEAP)
Multiple proj. (shotgun)      x2 cost
Guided weapon                 x4 cost per DM+1, minimum base cost of Cr5
Proximity fuzed only          x2 cost or +Cr5, whichever is more
Buying in lots of 1000+       x.8 cost
Buying in lots of 10000+      x.6 cost
Availability/legality         x what the market will bear

Example - You need some APDS reloads for a TL8 Penetration 21 cannon.
The base cost is Cr21, times 6 for APDS ammunition is Cr126 each.

Example - You need reloads for a TL7 Penetration 19 shoulder fired HEAP
rocket launcher. The base cost is Cr9.3, times 4 for a rocket, times 5
for HEAP is Cr186 each.

Example - You have a TL13 cannon firing caseless guided HEAP rounds with
a DM+3 and a Penetration of 28. The base cost is Cr27, times 2 for
caseless ammunition, times 5 for HEAP, times 4 three times for the
guided bonus is Cr17,280 per shot. Make them count...

As with most goods, manufacturing and sale cost will vary with the local
political climate. If APDS is the normal type of ammunition used,
competition will drive the price down. If it is brand new and there are
limited manufacturing facilities, the price will be higher. Availability
of ammunition depends on three levels: Tech Level, Law Level and
Population Level. The base 2D roll for easy availability at a major
population center is the planetary Population Level+2, levels A and
above needing a roll of 12-. Each Tech Level difference between the
ammunition and the planetary Tech Level is a DM-3 to this roll. If there
is a source, but the Law Level is past the legal to own on planetary
surface  level for the weapon firing this ammunition, it requires a
Difficult (2.5D) Streewise task to find said source, with a DM-2 for
each Law Level the weapon is illegal by. A critical failure means you
get in trouble of some kind. This could be immediate, like being present
during a police raid or having the supplier think you are an informant
or spy, or delayed, like buying from a sting operation, where the
character will be busted at some later date for the recorded and
witnessed illegal transaction.

Example - Characters touch down on a TL10 world with a Population Level
of 9 and a Law Level of 4. Wisely, they leave their heavy weapons on the
ship, but someone decides they need extra ammunition for a TL11 vehicle
autocannon. The 2D availability roll is 8- because of the DM-3 for Tech
Level difference. If there is some to be found here, it is a Difficult
Streetwise roll with a DM-2 for the illegal nature of the ammunition to
get an appointment with someone who can provide it. The haggling over
the price is left to the GM and player to work out.

Doesn\'t matter to me.  I only subscribe to two mailing lists (TML and 
GDW-Beta), so keeping them straight isn\'t a problem (if I understand the 
subject matter of the post, it\'s probably TML; if I don\'t understand what 
the heck they\'re talking about, it\'s probably GDW-Beta[grin!]).  

But having "TML" inserted into the subject line won\'t bother me at all.

The Spinward Marches, including the Aramis subsector, is a hotbed for 
Ancients sites.

I don\'t have my Trav stuff available for looking just at the moment, 
but I can tell you that there is one in the Rhylanor subsector just 
below Aramis on Rhylanor.  And, in the Yres system, in neighboring 
Regina subsector, there is space wreckage left over from the Ancient 
War.

If you have some CT stuff to referr to, look at the maps, sometimes 
they will note Ancient sites on different planets as they do Scout 
and Naval bases.

Wish I could give you some more specific information.

I sure wish they would release these in the US.  Good news is that I 
read on the BAB5 Lukers Guide on the web that TNT has ordered two 
made for TV movies of B5 and a new series focusing on the Rangers.  
All of these will take place before the end of the current B5 series 
although we\'ll be watching them after we\'ve seen the end of the show.

I do love Trek, and I agree that Voyager lags behind.  But, so did 
Deep Space 9, and now, in the last two years, DS9 is holding its own 
against TNG.  I think that Voyager will get there.  I\'ve already seen 
some pretty good shows this season, although that\'s the 
exception--not the norm.  

It took DS9  a couple  of years to get its act together, and I\'m 
hoping that Voyager will soon follow suit.

As far as B5, well, it is just incredible.  I rarely get that excited 
about a show.  It is by far the best SF show that I\'ve ever seen on 
TV.

This isn\'t a Traveller Answer, because I already answered
that question this week.  ;-)  I recently posted (as a Traveller
Answer] a table that allows you to look up a ship\'s armor 
rating (from the ship description), and gives you the equivalent
non-Starship armor rating (no math required).

In addition, along with the "sneak preview" weapons, Greg Porter
sent a draft of a conversion table for _Emperor\'s Arsenal_ that
converts between starship weapon ratings and non-Starship (personal
or vehicle) weapon ratings.  I didn\'t include that table in my
post, because Greg cautioned "the numbers may change" before the
book is finished.

 Pen    USP
 0-16   0-0-0-0
 17-20  1-0-0-0
 21-25  2-0-0-0
 26-29  3-0-0-0

Believe me, we know.  Everyone who has input on the starship design
or weapon and armor design systems is aware of the problem, and we\'re
working on fixes of one kind or another.

> We need a rule of thumb -- preferably in the form of a nice simple 10/1

Sorry, but no.  The problem is that the systems use two different
exponential scales.  Greg\'s system has the armor value proportional to the
cube root of the thickness; the starship system uses a (mostly arbitrary)
progression of numbers in a table.  Converting between the two and winding
up with numbers at least of the correct order of magnitude accross the
entire scale requires some math that I can\'t do on my fingers (but I can do
it on a calculator that is available at the local drugstore, and costs less
than the list price for _Starships_).

I always felt that sandcasters were very well defined and explained.  I play
TNE and there were several paragraphs about them in the space combat, ship
weaponry, and skill descriptions section.  

Here is how I understand a sandcaster:

It is a device that shoots canisters of magnetic (or electrically charged)
reflective ablative particles into the vacuum of space.  They aren\'t really
sand, nor are they employed passively.  These particles are controlled by
the gunner, and positioned into the path of the enemy\'s laser beam. It said
in TNE that lasers use a targeting LIDAR or RADAR and this is what allowed
the use of sandcasters as a defensive measure.  The particles are controlled
magnetically into a shape (presumably thickness and diameter) that will
interfere most with the incoming laser in terms of energy and wavelength.
Their magnetism allows them to follow along with the ship during vector
changes, they aren\'t lost, nor are they long term.  They are shot one
canister at a time, at one inbound laser which makes them different than a
field defense.  

The idea about polarizing them was fascinating (to allow better diffusing of
the enemy beam.)

If shot on the ground, since they are electrically charged, the B-field
lines could be aligned to propel the \'sand\' particles.  Range would be
limited by power generation, which would have to over come the planets
B-field, the atmospheric resistance, and probably the unaerodynamic particles.

I admit that I would like to see somebody\'s idea on how these damage ground
targets and atmospheric targets (picture a J-Hawk in a dogfight with a TL
5-7 fighter!?!)  Some suggestions in terms of \'Muzzle\' Energy, penetration,
and damage would all be super cool.

This was my take on them, according to TNE.

Saying rip-off was a bad choice of words.  I was referring to a genre 
rip off, but you are right, DR WHO is very original.

You like it, and I respect that.  I just think that it is crap.  I\'ve 
tried to watch it a few times, and I find it very uninteresting and 
bordering on the edge of stupid--well, it is stupid.

But, you like it, and I do recognize that it is very popular with 
some.

Well, heck, not everybody likes Traveller either.

AD&D is NOT a problem within TSR. TSR\'s problems are outside of AD&D. The
fact is TSR doesn\'t have anything outside of AD&D. For the record, there
is talk of reviving Greyhawk due to extreme loyalty to the gameworld of
fans. While Tim Brown was one of the original creators of Dark Sun, Troy
Denning is a MUCH larger influence. After Troy left (I think he moved to
the Planescape team), Bill Slaviscek stepped in and produced the Revised
Edition. However, by that time, sales have already dwindled. And as far as
Dragonlance goes, its back as the Fifth age, which uses the SAGA system.
That is, Fifth Age is NOT an AD&D product. SAGA, though, debuted with much
praise, and as I understand, DL stuff is selling pretty well.

Well, WoTC was stupid enough to try to building their own office building.
Guess where that money came from? M:tG made HUGE amount of money for WoTC
for a few years. It was their own stupid decisions that killed themselves.

While it is good to see the old stuff coming back, it also says something
about the industry. Are we so unimaginative that we have to rehash the old
as new? The fact is, ever since Star Wars, a movie that first showed 20
years ago, there had been nothing. Rather sad isn\'t it. Adn we are STILL
relying on ol\' George to make SF films that capture our imagination.

I\'m on other lists where the listadmin is really anal about list posts
having a category abbreviation in the subject header. One of the TML\'s
charms is the lack of such anality. 

I say "no, leave the subject header alone."

I think it wastes valuable space in the subject line.  Most decent filters
(I use procmail) can be set to examine the (unambiguous) "From:" line
rather than just the "Subject:" line.  Most folks I know of who read
multiple mailing lists use decent filters: they either already did or they
learned.  Procmail isn\'t even that hard.

Subject prefixes cause all sorts of gunk when you get replies and
forwards: what are we going to do when we get mail with headings like:
"TRV:Re: TRV:Re: How do sandcasters work?"  That\'s ugly.  And it\'s harder
to set up a mailer to treat the subject line properly than it is to
configure a decent filter in the first place.

So my vote is a definite "No way!"  :-)

I get about 100 mails a day and it\'s still no bother. Just autosort your
mail by sender and you\'ll get your mailing lists straight. Eudora Pro and
probably others have this facility.

Maybe they really do use the ships waste system and make tiny particles

          I would tend to vote for this - but even more would I prefer *digests*
           to come with *sort* of subject line (eg. TML 987 or whatever), the
          current completely blank line is not very helpful.

Way back in Book 2, Sand canisters were said to cost Cr400 each.
From what\'s been said, sand particles seem to be specialised
crystals, so I don\'t think ships waste would work.

	The different personal combat/starship damage and armor values
	is the main reason why I can not accept the T4 combat system.
	TNE had a working system where the same damage and armor values
	were used everywhere, but T4 uses a "simplified" system and
	discarded the whole idea.

	Example: TNE (or FFS)
	auto pistol: DV 2, pen 1-Nil; 	laser turret: DV 30, pen 1/10;
	combat armor: AV 4			system defense boat: AV 120

	Example: T4
	auto pistol: Damage 2 		laser turret: 1-1-1-1
	combat armor: AV ~4			system defense boat: Armor 40

	In FFS the damage value was based on the (square root of) delivered
	energy, and armor value was based on the "toughness" and thickness
	of armor plate.

	In T4 the damage values are probably based on G3 DV, and armor
	values are loosely based on FFS AV, but they use different scalings
	and are not directly compatible.

	This kind of things just seems to happen all the time in my
	campaign, and self-inflicted explosive decompression was one
	most common reasons for PC deaths until they learned it in the
	hard way. (RAM HEAP grenades should _not_ be used inside a
	starship, everyone should know where their vacc suit is, and
	using a landmate armor with portable mass-driver in boarding
	party is definitely overkill.)

This would be automated.  Majordomo would insert [TML] at the beginning of
each subject line.

There is no being anal about it.  You don\'t have to do anything, and while
I have a lot of filters set up on my work machine with Eudora, when I read
mail at night from home or on the weekends with Elm, I frequently cant tell
what from what.  If it were something that each poster would have to do I
would be against it, other than say:  Use good subjects.  But since we
strictly talking having majordomo insert a [TML] for you, then I am open
for discussion.

I am using Netscape Mail and view the list in individual mails.
My problem is that this mailer views the mail as coming from 
the individual sending it, not from the list, so I would really 
like to see a [TML] hung on the begining of each subject.

Well, there have been some great SF movies/TV since the release of Star
Wars.  Think of films like Terminator, CE3K, even-numbered Star Trek films,
and ET.  Television has given us ST:TNG and DS9 (I hate Voyager), Babylon 5,
the X-Files..

Star Wars is a timeless story about heroism, which is why it\'s great to see
it on the big screen again, but i have to disagree that we haven\'t had
anything good since then.

Stop and think about it. The more control society imposes the more
common bribery becomes. Because it is *necessary* to keep things
running smoothly.

If you are *caught*, you are in more trouble at a high law level. But
take a look at real-world history. Bribery *is* more common (and thus
more "accepted" by the *people, not the *law*) at higher law levels.

This is why laws against things that people don\'t really feel are wrong
never work out.

It *is* counter-intuitive. But it\'s the way the real world seems to
work.

On the other hand, at 4 km the flux of *x-rays* from the blast is only
1/16,000,000 of that one meter from the bomb. Given that most materials
are rather opaque to X-rays, that means that a (nominal) 100 kT blast
at 4 km will deposit the energy of a 6.25 kg blast at one meter. 

And for ships that aren\'t well shielded, you\'ll get the xrays going
into the ship and killing everyone.

I\'ve seen it done by refs.

The other two *workable* solutions to rules lawyers that I\'ve
encountered are:

1. knowing the rules better than they do (my solution in the old days).
Very few players will rules lawyer more than once with someone who can
reach into a stack of all the rules and supplements, pick out the right
book, open it to the right page with only a few flipped pages, and then
point to the details that they forgot to mention. :-)

2. not *having* rules. An old friend used to play this way. It wound up
being a sort of "directed story-telling" much like the Vampire games.

Except that it isn\'t a constant. The rules even say that the duration
varies. It just *averages* a week.

BTW, this is a problem for navigation. A planet orbiting at 30 km/sec
will move over 100,000 km in an hour. 

In fact, given this, I\'d say that it\'s possible to calculate your exit
point "exactly". The uncertainty in position comes from the *time*
uncertainty for the jump exit (ie you came out where you aimed, but the
planet has moved!)

There *isn\'t* one. A brown dwarf is simply a *big* gas giant that isn\'t
big enough to start fusion reactions at the core and thus become a star.
So any lower limit is arbitrary.

Consider the Terra/Luna pair. Or, worse yet, the Pluto/Charon pair. 

At some (arbitrary) point, you quit having a satellite and wind up with
a "double planet".

You have one simple, but rather basic misconception. You are thinking
of the categories into which we lump various sized bodies as if they
have some "real" meaning rather than merely being a convenience.

The only differences are size and composition. They *all* form out of
the initial cloud of dust and gas. Their composition starts out the
same. But once a "nearby" body gets massive enough to "light up", you
get the heat changing the composition.

The years of the different planets are different. And for various
reasons having to due with gravitational interaction, their periods
*cannot* be simple multiples of each other (if they were, they\'d pull
each other out of orbit). So that means that a given set of *relative*
planetary positions isn\'t going to repeat very often. The absolute ones
are even less likely to repeat. 

So if you get a wrong answer, it\'ll be wrong by *centuries*.

Yes, although I don\'t have a lot of use for it now, I\'d hate to discourage
someone from coming up with such useful material... I think the Genoee are
a fairly important race in the history on the Imperia... they were originally
thought to be a major race, but were later demoted to \'minor\' status,
they were one of the first races contacted by the Vilani, they form a
signifigant population in their section of space, making them important
in any political dealings in the subsector, etc. Now all we need is
some more art (more than that one drawing in S&A!).

Well, my vote is already in for the Merc Cruiser, but why not just

Merc Crusier this cycle, maybe a Trader the next time, then a Corsair,

BTW, as a separate question, I was looking for an official T4 answer
to a common question(s):

1) If you have a (say) J4 drive and do a J1, in T4 is all the jump
fuel consumed, or only part of it?

2) If you have a J1 drive and enough fuel for 2 jumps,  can you stop
in an \'empty\' map hex enroute?

Now, I realize that I\'m allowed to come up with whatever answer I want
to these questions, but I\'d like to know what the official T4 party
line is. Why? Because it can make a signifigant impact on ship designs
of course. If #2 is disallowed, the J1/double-fuel \'Far Trader\' would
be disallowed. if #1 is allowed, a military ship could mount a J2 drive
and be able to J1 out and back without having to refuel, or do a J2
if necessary, in 1 week instead of 2 (assuming #2 is allowed).

Anyways, if anyone saw this in the T4 rulebook where I missed
it, please let me know and provide a page reference, please.

Thanks,
Ethan

Yep. It\'d make a good adventure. Heck, IG could do a lot worse than
trying to license all of Piper\'s stuff. 

Here are some other Piper stories that\'d make good source material:

Space Viking (raiding "fallen" colonies, recivilizing same)
Uller Uprising (the natives decide to revolt... using nukes!)
The Fuzzy books (especially the fuzzy burglars)
Naudsonce (short story about first contact)
Oopmhel in the Sky (another native problem)
The Cosmic Computer (aka Junkyard Planet) 

That last one could be used for a *pre*-Millieu 0 history about how a
pocket empire *starts* and the fall of the second Imperium.

The others will all work in Millieu zero.

And they are all great sources for aliens and cultures.

Right. First it checks the spectrum of the nearby star to see if it
matches that of the target. At the same time you are checking for the
nav beacons that should be there. If they are there, they\'ll act like
the current GPS (global positioning system) satellites and enable you
to locate yourself precisely in both space *and* in time.

If the star doesn\'t match, and there aren\'t any nav beacons, you next
start scanning for radio signals sent from ISS observatories. These can
be picked up with a large antenna over quite a few parsecs.  But they
travel at light speed, so there has to have been time for them to
spread since the observatory was put online.

If you can\'t find those, you are well and truly lost. There was a
thread in rec.arts.sf.science about how to locate yourself in both
space and time (assuming a "jump drive" that has a *huge* range, and a
first flight where you don\'t know *how* to calibrate it :-). Borrowing
from what I recall of it...

First you scan for the magellanic clouds and other galaxies in the
"local group". Those will tell you which way is galactic north. It\'ll
also confirm which way is coreward. Together, these give you spinward.
And they give you a rough idea of where you are in the galaxy. 

Next you scan for globular clusters and pulsars. Those will narrow down
your position some more. And the pulsars give you a time (they slow
down over time, so the pulse rate tells you when the signal left the
pulsar). This ought to be enough to locate you.

Given the limited range of misjumps, it\'d be easier to just use a small
telescope (a meter or so) to get the spectra of the brighter stars. The
computer can check those against files and probably get matches pretty
fast.

Pulsars will give this. But you need to get a position first. And since
stars move relative to each other, that gives you another time check if
you get a spectral match.

I\'d say that you need special "sand". That\'s because you want something
that has some rather specific properties:

1. takes a *lot* of energy to melt
2. takes a lot of energy to convert the liquid into vapor
3. takes a lot of energy to turn gas into plasma
4. has a crystal structure and particle shape that acts as a
   "retroreflector" (like the particle in highway signs). This causes
   incoming energy to be reflected back towards the source. Not well
   enough to damage anything, but it\'ll help blind the sensors.
5. when converted to liquid drops, it should be "transparent" to the
   energy (this means that the spherical drops will *still*
   retro-reflect the energy)
6. gas & plasma forms should be *highly* opaque.

All of this combines to deflect large amounts of energy, defocus
transmitted energy and maximize absorbed energy.

This also means that laser beams passing thru sand will look like an sf
special effect. Which, incidentally, makes tracking the source of the
beam easier.

Where does it say this? In CT, and in (I thought) MT you had to have
the sand *in place* to stop a laser.

The beams won\'t do it. It takes fairly specific wavelengths to ionize
hydrogen, and most of them are *lousy* wavelengths for weapons grade
lasers. Also, detecting the ionization would be real difficult, as
there wouldn\'t be that much.

Ok, I have given this some thought.  As a test, so people can see

Monday and Tuesday, I will turn it back off, and let a discussion

I will post the results, and change/not change the list accordingly.

   If I may add my two cents here the RPG industry needs to start any type of
advertising. The only reason I ever played Trav was a curiousity as to who
are these guys in the back of the comic shop(soon to take over the hole thing
and press the CCGers into that little area back were we started      back
back and take your dam mana with you!!) and why are they blocking the

for a 3 speed turbo backshaver. But the only adds for Gaming Doodads is in
the back of a GAMING BOOK now there is a why to get new custmers! But you
cant blame them it is kind of a hard thing to advertise.

The desire to have such a *tool*, I think, is what the anality comment was
aimed at...  ;-)  I think trying to "ease the pain" of being subbed to a
high traffic mailing list is pointless... and it leads to ongoing
discussions about things that should have long ago died (rocks et al)
because some [fill in the blank] sleeps too much to be able to keep up with
the list on a daily basis...  *sigh*  If you can\'t post with the big
dogs... unsubscribe until you can, and read the archive!!!  That\'s what
it\'s for...  When I couldn\'t handle the volume last summer prior to GenCon
and the release of T4 (when everyone and their dog was trying to subborn
Marc into using their ship design ideas for FF&S), I took myself off the
beta list and all the others: take it from me, it\'s good advice; it\'s mine.

I think that we all should be in the habit of changing our subjects to be
more descriptive of content, as well as good quoting practices (i.e. not
quoting the whole @#$&ing post to add ONE line!), but adding TML so that
someone who\'s not going to read the posts anyway can filter them better
just annoys me...  I\'m on two other lists that do that, I really dislike
it.  If I can\'t tell from the subject that it\'s from TML rather than ME or
CGIHTML, then the poster is a goober, it\'s off topic, and I might as well
just delete the message unread.  I\'m just as guilty as everyone else about
subject headers, but...  Please don\'t diddle with the subject line.

Judging from its name, no. Crystaline particles of sand will refract and
diffuse light in the IR, visible, UV, and X-ray range. But particles
much smaller in diameter than the typical wavelength of radar (cm to
meter range) will have no effect on it.

Just to clarify this.  Settlers of Catan was invented in Germany.  Maybe
Mayfair Games had the license for this game, but they didn\'t create it.
Any yes, it\'s a wonderful game.

I hadn\'t realized that TNE said this. It is just one more case of previous
canon being overthrown by useless detail, I guess.

The problem with this interpretation is that it just won\'t work. If sand
is supposed to ablate or reflect laser beams, it will be far more
effective to coat your ship with it as ARMOR, than to waste most of it
by shooting it into space.

Ablat/reflec sandcasters make as much sense in SciFi as hurling a shield
as a frisbee to intercept incoming arrows makes in fantasy. If the sand
ablates and reflects in space, it will ablate and reflect just as well
when coated on the surface of your ship. So keep it on the surface of your
ship, where it will be sure to do some good.

There are rules for this, you can find them in the ship design tables
under ARMOR. Sandcasters must be something different.

To reiterate a previous post, the only interpretation of sand I know of
that may make sense is that it REFRACTS laser light, which then diffuses
(de-focuses) into a less intense beam before it strikes your ship. If
you can think of another workable explanation, let me know.

Exqueeze me? Bearing in mind DW started in 1963, what exactly is it 
supposed to be a rip off *of*? (And I won\'t mention that it lasted for 
longer than every version of ST put together, on a budget that wouldn\'t 
pay for Shatner\'s toupee). And as for SC, since this was one of the few 
series that was SCIENCE Fiction, rather than Science FICTION, the same 
question applies.

What would it accomplish?  You can already distinguish messages to the TML
using their From: or Reply-to: fields, for any required manual or
automated filtering.  Adding a Subject: tag would just waste space that
could be used for meaningful content.

Not correct.  Simple (non-integer, but simple) multiple periods aren\'t
merely possible, there\'s a lovely example right in our own backyard.
Neptune and Pluto are in a 3:2 orbital resonance with one another...so
every three orbits of Neptune and two of Pluto, they arrive at (almost)
precisely the same *absolute* configuration!

So, if all you had to go on was Neptune and Pluto, you could only
determine your current time modulo (2 * Ppluto).  However, add *any*
non-resonant body to the system (any of the other planets, or even Triton
and Nereid around Neptune) and you can determine a unique time solution
with high confidence.

> 1) If you have a (say) J4 drive and do a J1, in T4 is all the jump

In T4, only part of the jump fuel is consumed.  If you have 40% of your ship
as jump fuel tankage, you have enough fuel for 4 parsecs, no matter how you
slice it (4 1-parsec jumps, 2 2-parsec jumps, or any other combination).
The only variable is how long you take to get there.

In Classic Traveller (Book 2), starships consumed all of their jump fuel, no
matter how far the jump actually took the ship.  In the first edition of
High Guard, a device (the jump governor) was introduced which limited jump
fuel consumption (just as I described above).  The second edition of High
Guard made the jump governor standard equipment on all jump drives, and it\'s
been that way ever since (through the rest of CT, MT, and T:TNE).

> 2) If you have a J1 drive and enough fuel for 2 jumps,  can you stop
> in an \'empty\' map hex enroute?

Yes.  A ship would normally spend about a day in deep space, so that the
engineers can perfom checks and maintainance on the jump drive before the
ship jumps again.  It is possible to jump again almost immediately (less
than an hour after emergence from jumpspace) if these safety procedures are
skipped.  The consequences of skipping the checks and maintainance are up to
the referee.

Since jump drives can navigate with relatively high precision, it\'s quite
possible to use tanker starships (or large cargo ships with fuel tanks
installed in the holds) to refuel ships in deep space.

> If #2 is disallowed, the J1/double-fuel \'Far Trader\' would be disallowed.

It\'s valid, and cheaper (but slower) than the true J2 Far Trader.

> If #1 is allowed, a military ship could mount a J2 drive
> and be able to J1 out and back without having to refuel

This is a particularly valid tactic.  A battle fleet emerging from jumpspace
with enough remaining jump fuel to perform at least a J-1 has the option of
retreating by jumping, which can save lives and ships.

This tactic is at the core of the battleship versus battlerider debate.
Battleships can jump to safety if they find themselves in a loosing fight.
Riders MUST win, because both the riders and their carrier are vulnerable
during a the docking operation, and carriers that are attacked by enemy
warships may have to jump out or be destroyed, either case stranding their
riders in a hostile system.

On the other hand, ton for ton and credit for credit, a battle rider is
a more powerful combat warship than a battleship, since the battleship has
to haul jump drives and jump fuel tankage into battle.

Ugggh. See, *this* is what I have trouble keep straight in my head.
I only own one copy of High Guard, so I can\'t do deltas to see what changed
when... this \'multiple canon\' thing is more painful than being hit by
\'multiple cannons\'.

Double Ugggh. Why not just print the email addresses for Wildstar,
TML and GDW-Beta in the front of the rulebook and be done with it?


Hey Joe, if the T4 Deluxe Edition ever comes out, tell IG to replace
the art with useful information, like this. Letting the whole world know
this is going to save a lot of refs a lot of hassle when they discover
they left their (referee) Fiat parked in the wrong spot.

Player: Hey! How did they get here! We have jump-2, they only have
        jump-1, they can\'t get here from there!
Ref: Um, they have extra fuel tankage and did j-1s.
Player: We wanted to do that last week and you said we couldn\'t!
Ref: Uh, well, um... see, I bought this new adventure and it says you
     can, so, um, they can now. Oops.
<sounds of limbs being ripped off of ref, etc>

Thanks for the answer though.

Personally (note that word), I would like them.  I run about 12 mailing
lists now and I have to receive them to make sure they are going out.  All
of the TSR based lists use the [name] tag and when I am scanning my Elm
mail looking for non-list mail, it is easy to tell what needs to be
ignored.  When I was on the majordomo list, I couldn\'t tell if messages
were problems people were posting to the majordomo list, or intended for me
to deal with without reading the message.

Also filtering doesn\'t mean not reading.  It kinda means threading in a
very limited scope.  When I want to read TML mail, I don\'t want photography
mail interspersed in between.  I filter TML to a folder, Photography to a
folder, then read things a topic at a time.

There is a thread going on on the list right now "TSR\'s collapse".  While
the subject is descriptive enough, I can\'t tell if it is coming from
Traveller, Dark Conspiracy, or Forgotten Realms.

But, I prefer to run this list not in a dictorial manner, but rather a
somewhat democratic manner.  Its your list, I just deal with the bad
addresses.  That is why I want to have the list try a couple of days with
the tag, and then discuss the various methods and then put it to a vote.
It is the most fair thing.

Yeah, Star Wars (the whole trilogy) is really more an illustration of
Joseph Campbell\'s _The Hero with a Thousand Faces_ than SF; you could very
easily recast the entire thing in terms of medieval fantasy and not drop a
single plot point.  This is *not* a criticism, by the way!  Whole I prefer
my SF rather hard-edged and science rich, Star Wars operates in an
entirely different category, and within that category it\'s brilliant.

I actually saw the reissued version last night.  Am I alone in thinking
that the new footage sucked bigtime?  The scene with Jabba had Han Solo
reiterating what he\'d just told the bounty hunter in the bar *word for
word* -- it was *so* clearly a case of dialog being moved from unused
scene A to substituted scene B in the original.  Also, Jabba looked
utterly unrealistic; his movements made no sense.  Mos Eisely was crowded
with new creatures and droids...many of which had inconsistent shadows,
and all of which you could *plainly* tell were not being reacted to by the
original actors in the scenes.  It ended up reminding me of Toon Town in
"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?".  

I could go on.  *Sigh*.  I hate it when people mess with perfection.  I
wish Lucas had just added "Episode IV: A New Hope" to the opening spiel,
cleaned up the matte lines, and left it at that.  Ah, well. :(

Im heading out to Boston from Scotland for 3 weeks holiday but plan on
stocking up on T4 stuff as it is kind of hard to get in th UK ( and
bloody expensive).  Can any Americans give me the address of a good
games shop in central Boston or thereby. 

BTW, how can Imperium get away with charging 22.95 dollars for CSC, i
seen it my own game shop and it was bloody 17.00 pounds sterling and
although it looks not bad im not paying that.

I have always ruled that a ship may do a jump _less_ than its jump
number (but greater than zero parsecs; leave the microjump can-o-worms
CLOSED) and consume a volume of fuel = (.1dT)(Parsecs Jumped). IOW, if a
far trader makes a jump-1 with a full fuel load, it uses half of its
j-fuel, and need not refuel for a second J-1.

In my games, I allow this practice. While there are a lot of technoid
matters that the astrogator must consider involving the relative motion
of the destination system, and the "age" of EM data from navigational
marker stars/phenomena, the realm of those considerations, for game
purporses lie within the definition of the character\'s skills.

I believe these to be the official party line, but I can\'t quote chapter
and verse.

Consider this concept from TNE (I know it isn\'t T4, and I hear some
teeth gnashing at the mention of this three-letter word, but it _is_
Trav): the _Nemesis_-class cruisers mentioned in the _Regency
Sourcebook_ (which originally appeared in a TD). The _Nemesis_ ships
were given huge meson guns, black globe generators, J-3 drives and
tankage for J-5. Mission: jump to a system 2 parsecs away where the
Zhodani invaders were, turn the globe all the way up, drift in along a
vector toward the enemy, drop globe and open fire from ambush once in
range, then get the hell out.

It would REALLY depend on the platoon, now wouldn\'t it ;-) A platoon of
your average mudfoots, no way, a platoon of Dorsai, now....that\'s an
enTIREly different story.

BTW I cast a vote for the Happy Fun Ball design competition....ever since
that was mentioned, I haven\'t been able to get the phrase out of my head!

Also, someone, I think Leonard, posted a list of H. Beam Piper books, the
ships in _Space Viking_ probably are the inspiration for the original
Mercenary Cruiser.  I\'m gonna reread my (well thumbed) copy this
weekend...there are some detailed descriptions of the ships in there.
Also, IIRC, the plot wasn\'t really all that much about re-civilizing lost
worlds as raiding them for their goodies; it was the space vikings, IMO,
who were re-civilized.

I\'ve always played it that part of the success at the astrogators skill
allowed the time to be closer to the average (168 hrs?).  That would prevent

This gave me a really interesting idea.  Yeah, I know it is a rip off from
ST-DS9, and I know it is probably way out of hard sci-fi, but I thought it
would be neat...

Say the above happened to that planet they found in DS9 where the planet
phased into an energy form for part of it\'s orbit.  I worked nights for so
long and I didn\'t get to watch DS9 much, but I recall a planet that Dax (I
think) met a guy on and fell in love with only to find that in a few days he
would be phased into energy.  Well, what if our dear scout vessel was headed
out to survey a new system that had a GG and a single planet.  The
astrogator sets the coordinates and executes a perfect jump.  One week later
the ship arrives and the planet is gone.  The system only contains a GG, not
even any debris.  Instant paranoid scout ship. :)

1.  Please send me a list of what 10 ships, or ship concepts you want to do.
This should eliminate the need for voting on what ship we want to do since
all the votes will already be in.  Please send it to me and don\'t clutter

2.  There has been some discussion of problems with the USP format.  Send me
a blank USP model of what you think would be a good complete problem free
USP.  I will weed through these and come up with the most complete
reasonable structure for the USP.  Please put "THUDD USP" in the subject line.

3.  I have a few ideas about how to put these on the web for use later.  If
you are interested in posting some of these on your web site as part of the
official THUDDD page, send me a note with "THUDDD" somewhere in the subject
line. (Unofficial posting to web pages needs to be approved by the designer
of the ship.)


I\'m sure I\'ll think up some other ideas for how to make this a \'mo betta\'

think this is enough.  I know Roderick and I have talked about a few things

Something I heartily reccommend to every referee: keep a campaign notebook
where you note not only what happened in the campaign, but what rulings
and interpretations you had to make, details you\'ve filled in, and so on.
Periodically, you can review it, and you\'ll find that you can "mine" the
campaign\'s own history for adventure seeds.

It\'s neat when the PCs (finally) realize that the person who is giving them
so much trouble now is the very same Etaoin Shrdlu that they swindled as
part of a scam they did more than a year ago.

You can also use this to keep your rulings and "house rules" straight.  At
one point, I even typed up a neat copy of some of my notes and gave them as
a handout to the players.  Kind of a "FAQ" on the campaign.

Later in my post I said that it does refract it.  I apologize for the error
in the beginning, but the sand burning away will dissipate energy as fill it
reflecting or absorbing it.  The advantage that \'sand\' has over being
painted on your hull is that of redundancy.  If you paint it on your hull,
it gets burned off after a blast--just like armor.  But if you throw it out
into space, you can constantly renew it after every laser blast.  That is
why higher TL sandcasters have a higher canister capacity, and a better beam
reduction.  

Sandcasters are viable, thought the reference to a frisbee is poor.  A
better analogy is trying to shoot a arrow through a bamboo thicket.  It is
easier to get behind the thicket, than to wear it (like armor.)  

When you get down to it, the only important parts of a sandcaster are that
it disrupts the beam, it is renewable, it is controlled by a field (B or
gravitic) and is an active defense.

The actual writing from TNE is as follows (I paraphrased the stuff above):

  "A sandcaster is a turret-mounted anti-laser defensive system.  THe turret
projects an electromagnetic field and uses the field to hold in place a
cloud of highly reflective crystals of silicon, called sand (although it is
artifically manufactured, not the kind you find on beaches.)"

It\'s a little brief, and does leave out the part someone else mentioned that
at higher levels gravitic control comes into play with the crystals.

	Leonard recently posted the important details of some stuff that 
came off rec.arts.sf.science sometime last year and which he was kind 
enough to repost here for us at that time.
	In this interpretation, "sand" is made up of little transparent
beads that work like the beads in road roadway reflectors that reflect 
light straight back to its source.  Since no reflector is perfect, these 
little beads will melt instantaneously due to the power of the laser.  
Since they are in space, though, the transparent liquid will maintain its 
shape and continue reflecting until it is vaporised.  In the gaseous 
state, the sand is opaque and absorbs energy until it becomes a plasma.  
Plasmas are even more opaque and capable of absorbing large amounts of 
energy.
	I can think of a few reasons why this material might be more 
effective as "sand" than as armor.
	(1)  Having reflective stuff all over your ship makes you more 
		visible to certain sensors.
	(2)  Large amounts of surface area have to be used for other things 
		(like antennae) and can\'t be coated.
	(3)  If the beads are in contact with your ship, then when they 
		turn to plasma they are going to transmit their energy to 
		your hull.  Because they turn to plasma essentially 
		instantaneously, they are going to basically explode. This is 
		likely to be less damaging than the laser, but having 
		parts of your hull turn to plasma is likely to be something 
		you\'d rather avoid.
	
	This is not to say that this is the one true way, but it\'s at 
least a plausible explanation.

section on fashion design.  Wildstar, will this glaring lack be rectified
in NAH?

        If it comes down to the Far Trader, I will keep the specification
really simple, such as "A commercially viable TL-12 200 Td merchant vessel
with a jump range greater than 1"; this ought to produce an interesting
variety of useful vessels for us as it leaves considerable latitude in
M-drive, J-Drive, armament, etc, with the limiting factor of commercial
viability keeping people from loading them up with PA guns and 6G M-drives

        Pretty much: I have to carpetbomb the entire province with CV\'s,
write a midterm, go to job interviews, work on a term essay, work on an
extra-credit paper, study on my other courses, thrash out details for
breaking my lease and moving at the end of March, work, run a T4 campaign,
and keep my girlfriend from leaving me :).

        Basically, I\'ll administer this one with Paul doing the backup

really afford the time to continuously run them...

        Something that I\'d thought you might want to try is this dodge
called cumulative voting that you see in some corporate constitutions;
Essentially, you vote for each seat on the board one at a time rather than
all at once.  All the votes for the losing candidates get carried over onto
the next seat and are counted in the voting for that next seat, so that
even small minorities will eventually get a director or two on the board...

        It strikes me that this would work well here.  Right now the voting
is shaping up as a tight race between the Far Trader and the Merc Cruiser.
Doing cumulative voting would almost guarantee that the losing popular
candidate would be done next...

        But hey.  The next THUDDDs are your baby; do\'em any way you want :).

        Something that I want to reiterate to everyone is that putting the
hull shape and configuration  (i.e. shape and configuration, such as
airframe wedge) in the USP is good and highly biscuit-worthy.  I agree with
Paul that a standardized USP with everything laid out neatly is a very good
thing: it makes everybody\'s life a little easier.

I had been hoping to be able to present to the list the new T4 stats for the AHL, amidst a 
fanfare of hurrahs. The sad news is the AHL is impossible under Starships due in almost 
whole part to the surface area requirement of power plants. Work it out, a 60000 ton cruiser 
requires a 60000 MW thruster plate, which in turn requires a 60000 MW power plant. The 
requirement just for this is 66000 m2. A 60000 ton ship only has 63000 m2 of hull space. 
Even a lousy 1G thruster requires a total of 33000 m2 for necessary power plant and 
thrusters. Even before I gave up, I had to reduce the weapons, generally halving the 
number, and dropping the partacc bays, I reduced the number of fighters by one-third. That 
is when I added up the area remaining, and proclaimed unto the world "aaah, shit, it ain\'t 
gonna work!"
BTW, surface area is area remaining on this form

This really pissed me off!!!!  You mistakenly assume that the point made by
FFS is useless detail because you are so stuck on either following the
letter of the rule or bashing TNE for all your worth that you can\'t even
begin to use a hint of creativity about this.  I have no idea about previous
canon, and I really don\'t care.  ***NEWS FLASH***  Marc Miller IS Traveller
and he said T4 will use a modified form of FFS.  Guess what that means.
Canon is now what TNE\'s FFS said.  Like it or lump it, but when the owner of
the rights to a product decide to change it, that makes it officially
changed.  You can deny it all you want to, but the fact remains that useful
information that you call "useless detail" is not a overthrowing canon, it
IS canon.  The man with the authority to say so has said so!

You are probably so blinded by your hatred of TNE that you are unable to
accept the fact that what FFS said about sandcasters might just possibly be
useful so I won\'t even begin to try to explain.  However...

You are free to use this variant, but as I understand it the Ablat/reflec
coating will be seriously degraded by micrometeor impacts.  I am not an
engineer, so I can\'t talk to the reality of viability of sandcasters, but if
you want reality, don\'t play a game!

>There are rules for this, you can find them in the ship design tables
>under ARMOR. Sandcasters must be something different.

To my knowledge (and I very well could be wrong) the current rules for T4 as
explained in SSDS and QSDS and the posts by Dave and Wildstar about the FFS
changes and FFS itself do not have any such allowances for starships.

I believe that FFS states the the beam burns its way through the cloud of
"sand" (not sand) and that is how it works.

Again, I apologize for the tone of this post, but I am seriously SICK of
people knocking TNE because they don\'t like it when in reality, they just
aren\'t creative enough to use it.

A shame, isn\'t it, that you\'ve thus been forced to cover up all your
antenna elements?  Too bad that lasers keep boiling your turret housings
off the hull when the beam catches the worn portion at the seam of the
rotator cuff.  Our naval architects are still working on how to mount
baffles of the stuff in front of the thruster plate exhaust.

The flexibility and cheapness of fired sand canisters makes a LOT of
sense, if you stop and think about it in practical terms.

I thought we were allowed to ignore power plant area, to avoid precisely

I\'ve been making up an animal chart and ran into a problem.  It\'s not too
important, but is kind of a good visual detail to have correct.

On page 142, under the heading of Animal Characteristics, the entry for \'A\',
that is, attack says that it will read \'0\', meaning it will attack if a
special criteria is met (does this mean, like the puncer one says surprised?).

Also, on page 152, under the Encounter table for Regina, the characteristics
are written, for the first four animal in the formt A/F/S  Then, it switches
to F/A/S.  Is this important, or just an editing problem?  

I\'d appreciate answers to these questions, as I\'m want to make my adventure
entry int he IG contest be correctly formated.

Also, a question regarding task.  What is the proper format for their
inclusion in the text in T4.  Should they be seperated from the text, or
embedded?

Thanks,

The A/F/S format is for carnivores and the F/A/S format is for
herbivores. Carnivores role for attack then flee, whereas
herbivores role for flee then attack.

I\'m not sure if there\'s an "official" format for this. I\'ve always
imbedded them in paranethis e.g.
"...unless the lock is picked (difficult, dex)...."

Hope these help.

    'body' => 'Hi,

Maybe it\'s just me, but I\'m having trouble doing character
generation with T4.  The process isn\'t all that hard, but the
current layout in the book is a pain.  In addition to the charts being
jumbled up, you have to flip back and forth over several pages (those 2
*darn* color plates are in the way <g>).

So, I\'m creating some aids to help me and, hopefully, others with this.

1.  THE TRAVELLER CHARACTER GENERATION WORKSHEET (no, not a
    Spreadsheet, a paper form)

        I\'ve printed out a ton of these so I can work up characters.
        I do all my erasing and rewriting on the worksheet.  After
        I\'ve got the character generated I transfer the information
        to a CHARACTER RECORD SHEET (right now I\'m using the one in
        the T4 book).  The Worksheet fits on, tightly, on a single
        page, if you want to use it you should save it to disk and
        chop the header off.
        
2.  A STEP BY STEP CHARACTER GENERATION PROCEDURE

        I took the process and the charts and arranged them together
        so you can step right through the process without having to
        jump back and forth.  This Aid takes character generation
        through Characteristics, Homeworld generation, Common and
        Background Skills...so far.  I\'m sending this as pure ASCII,
        not even any tabs to make it as easy for people to copy as
        possible.  I did place some "suggested page breaks" in the
        document, but of course YMMV. ;->
        
I plan to take this through Advanced Education and through each of the
career paths in the T4 book.  I haven\'t gotten this finished yet, but I
wanted to put out what I have so far, and get some opinions from the lists. 
We\'re talking several pages here, and if the list isn\'t interested I won\'t
waste the bandwidth.
        
Admission:  I\'m not too thrilled with some of the skills tables in T4. I\'m
looking for something a little closer to the advanced systems from
Mercenary, Scouts, and High Guard.

Well anyway, once I get the current procedure written out in a step-by-step
format I plan on beginning to make changes.  I\'ll also be including my
revisions to the skill system...eventually.  ;->

    ImpBu has decided there is a need for a military auxiliary vessel that
has the capability to insert a small number of troops into varied
environments.
Minimum requirements include the capability to carry at least three squads,
plus their support personnel into varied situations, including hostile
landings
(however drop tubes as a fixed feature are not allowed as not all troops will
be trained to use them). Provide Command and Control capabilities for them.
Be
able to provide fire support to the troops. Be capable of at least two
month\'s
sustained engagement and provide medical care for the troops. Capable of
providing some sort of mechanized transport for the troops.
    Additional points will be given for flexibility of mission design.
Ability to provide close support for the vessel and the troops. Designs
that qualify for these additional points will be granted a 10%-20% discount
when compared against other submitted vessels.
    As usual a low maintenance cost is desired.


(The original Broadsword Mercenary cruiser was created and subsidized by the
Imperial bureaucracy to provide additional protection and order by mercenary
troops in instances where regular troops aren\'t available. It is also used as
an auxiliary military vessel in the Imperial Navy.
     It was created somewhere after year 988 (modular cutters weren\'t
in production till 988).
     It could carry two modular cutters and 4 modules, plus one air/raft.
It had the capability to carry 4 fighters (6-ton), an ATV, a weapons pod, a
passenger module, fuel skimming module, an assualt boat module, a pressurized
shelter and a cargo module.
     It had a sickbay.
     There were many varied designs, some armed, some not. Some with more
armor.

     Some suggestions that come to mind for the new version include CBM
missiles if the ship is equipped with missile turrets. Anti-personnel/
Anti-vehicle weapons on auxiliary vessels if used to ferry troops or
provide support to troops. If main vessel is to be landed, it should
probably also have similar weapons.
     Melieu Zero vessels are most probably corporate (through various
parties)
or military owned. I wouldn\'t expect too many unaffiliated mercenary
companies around.

Weighing in with a few book recommendations...

David Weber (of the Honor Harrington series) has also co-written two 
books based on Task Force Games\' Starfire game: these are Crusade and 
Insurrection (Baen Books). I\'ve seen Insurrection a lot, but I\'m not sure 
if Crusade is still in print.

I\'m currently finishing Gregory Benford\'s Galactic Center series (In the 
Ocean of Night, Across the Sea of Stars, Tides of LIght, Great Sky River, 
Furious Gulf, Sailing Bright Eternity). While vastly different from the 
Traveller Universe (no FTL travel, for one thing), Benford tosses 
concepts around like...well...stars and black holes and they are a 
potential wellspring of great concepts to toss at jaded Traveller 
players. For example, cosmic strings, The Eater of All Things (a huge 
black hole at the center of the galaxy) and a war being mechanical beings 
and organic lifeforms....

I\'ll also throw in a vote for the Trowbridge/Smith books that Chris Weuve 
nominated. However, be warned, I\'ve yet to find Volumes I and III...

I happened to pick up the latest issue of Cinefantastique to look at the 
articles about the SFX of The Empire Strikes Back. While looking in the 
bookstore, I saw some Foss art...and the words Sweetpea 
Entertainment...and a proposal called The Traveller.

The article interviewed Courtney and he (yes he) outlined the various 
plans that Sweetpea has including the D&D movie, a horror 
movie/television series and...kind of vague...a movie/show called "The 
Traveller" based on a game by a guy named "Mark" (not Marc) Miller.

Has some illumination from the other end of the business for us...I\'ll 
try to bring some $$$ next week and pick up the magazine and transcribe 
what was said.

Still catching up!

Saw the note about somebody seeing the ads in the back of COAAC. The 
"Flashback" got me curious, so I pulled out my copy to look. BTW, there 
is an ad there for "Aslan" and "Robots" as well. Aslan sounds like the 
classic edition (hell, GDW was still selling copies a few years ago!). 
Robots definately said "MT" in the description, maybe they were working 
on a new edition?

The Flashback adventure sounds definately good, I wonder how far they 
got? Some adventurers from de early days (Mileux Zero anyone) are forced 
into hibernation. Every now and again they decant themselves and take a 
look around to see if they can cure what ails them. Then they go back 
into hibernation...in this way they visit every major era, Classic, 
Rebellion and--I guess--Hard Times eras (since TNE was only a gleam in 
the eye\'s of the creator then).

Once we get enough information published by IG (Mileux 0 to ?), maybe 
this could be revived and brought to life?

        In fact, if it weren\'t for the lack of navigation devices, I\'m sure

        Asi it happens, what we\'re planning on doing is having people, when

produce multiple biscuit recipients, one for each category, as well as an

anybody else have any ideas on this?

I actually have the three MT books online. When I make a rules change, I
edit those versions and reprint the appropriate pages. The rule books I
use are printed copies of the online versions, and my original MT books
are
in a box somewhere. That way I always have the most current rules right
in
front of me.

When fired against a *ground* target, the impact velocity is whayever
velocity the sand exits the weapon with.

In space, the impact velocity is the sum of the velocity of the weapon
and the *closing velocity* of the incoming ship/missile. That makes a
*big* difference. 

Remember, at *less than* 15 km/s a *paint chip* blasted a crater the
size of a thumbnail in one of the Shuttle\'s main windows.

"Sand" probably has a similar mass. And it\'s moving a *lot* faster. And
there\'s lots and lots of it.

I figure that even superdense is going to lose at least half a cm or
more when passing thru a cloud of sand. More likely several cm.

I\'ve read lots about this pogo-stick, if you have a spare minute, and the
stats for it on your computer, could you e-mail it to me.  I\'d really like
to see this helarious design.

Actually, I went the tedious route. Over a two year period, doing a
little
bit almost every day, I typed them in. Scanning wasn\'t that reliable,
and
by typing them in I could correct for errata and change rules at the
same
time.

When I eventually buy T4 I\'ll just slowly merge those rules into my
current
ones so the transition will be smoother.

In the future the water usage would be the same but the ship recycling
system will be able to reclaim a good percentage of the water 80%, which
makes water consumption about 1 gallon.

Using the replicator and advance technology you can probably reduce food
consumption down to 2-4 lbs depending on what quality of food you want to
serve.  The navy has a long tradition of serving the best food of any of
the services.  I would tend to use the 4 lbs figure, which includes things
like cigarettes, and personal hygene articles.

vessel, equipped for battle situations, marine contingent, Jump-1, a ywa to
get marines to surface, and hull < 1500"

THanks,

Right.  "A0" or "F0" means "check the rules for the special rule for this
animal".  The pouncer entry says (under "To Attack"), "Surprised" - this
means that a pouncer will attack if the prey is surprised.  If the prey
(usually your player characters) isn\'t surprised, the pouncer will do something
else (like flee, if the PCs surprise the pouncer).  A speed of zero, "S0",
indicates that the animal can\'t move (for example, The Great Sarlac from
_Return of the Jedi_ is an example of an immobile trapper).

Yes, this is important.  Here\'s the explanation:

"The three final columns are unlabeled, but each always bears a prefix; they
 indicate the probable reactions by the animals.  The first column indicates
 the most probable reaction on encounter; the second column indicates the
 next most probable reaction if the first does not occur.  The referee, in
 resolving the encounter, must consult the first column, throwing two dice:
 [if the roll succeeds], the animal attacks (if the prefix letter is A), or
 flees (if the prefix letter is F).  If the first throw is not achieved, the
 second column is consulted.  A listed throw of 0 indicates that some
 special consideration is called for, such as attack only if bigger than
 the prey, or flight only if surprised [...].  In such cases, see [the T4
 rules].  The last column, prefixed S, indicates the speed of which the
 animal is capable."
 
I found the above paragraph in Traveller Suppliment 2: _Animal Encounters_
(GDW: 1979 and LONG out of print).  The explanation in T4 is a little
shorter:

"Most animals will attack before they flee, so the order of the codes should
 be A F S; herbivores will probably flee first, so they should be
 coded F A S."

The reference is located at the top of T4 pp.145, under the heading
"Herbivores".

Also note that there is a minor disagreement between pp.144-145, which
indicate that the animal reaction numbers are "target or better" throws (so
that "A9" means "Attack on a 2D6 throw of 9+"), and pp.142 which says the
opposite (so that "A9" means "Attack on a 2D6 throw of 9-").  Finally, note
that the example table (for Regina) contains values that can\'t be generated
using the rules as presented in T4.  The errata available on the IG website
doesn\'t resolve these problems conclusively.

IN MY OPINION: Use the rules as presented to generate "target or better"
throws for animal encounters.  The example table seems to use "target or
less" throws.  Personally, I\'ll pull out my copy of Supplement 2 when I
need some animal encounter tables.

Personally, I prefer them separated from the text, but I don\'t know if IG
has a standard.  I\'ve seen material published by IG formatted both ways.

 Jump takes 168 hours plus or minus 10%, and that\'s regardless of the jump
distance (ie,  jump-1, jump-6, etc). The original incarnations of Traveller
(back in 1977) said one week, and the details evolved as the nee4d arose to
be more specific.

I have enjoyed reading the Geonee posts, and I\'d hate to see you stop them.

Meanwhile, I am of a mind to include a sidebar (or more than one) on Geonee
and Suerrat in upcoming books, just for some background and other details. In
fact, because the adventure structure calls for a push and a pull, I was
thinking that Suerrat would become an omni-present push... a rival to the
Imperium working to establish their own power base.

Jeff,

You have asked for it, I will repost it.

he following is a list of armor materials from TNE converted to CSC/VDS
armor values.

To convert your own the formula is:
ROUND(POWER((XX/TNE_Hard_Steel_Toughness),0.33)*CSC_Hard_Steel_Toughness,0.5)
XX is the TNE armor value that you wish to convert.

The formula is similar to the one that Greg used to convert from TNE to
CSC/VDS, he sent me a message on how he arrived at the armor values in CSC.

Some of these materials were aquired via web pages, and FTP sites.
Unfortunatley I do not remember them all, but Dave Golden is one of the web
pages.

Notes:
Electropolymorphic Synthetics is dual armor value due the greater armor
value is only when a 1Mw per m3 is applied.
Monodium is a crude attempt to approx the gray metal of the Ancients.
Obscenieum is armor for when your PC\'s need a lesson, I use it as benchmark
for obscene values.

I know how you feel, sometimes what seems to me to be an erroneous
position will be stated and restated until I can\'t stand to hear it
anymore. When that happens, the next person to mention the subject (the
next person to lay a straw on the camel\'s back) gets bitten by me.
Sand has been discussed for a long time on this list. Now that the
discussion has really taken off, I felt compelled to mention the (IMHO,
overiding) importance of refraction, as opposed to reflection or
ablation.

My comment on needless detail overiding canon was not directed at TNE.
This problem has plagued all incarnations of Traveller; MT being the
worst offender, as far as I know. (And I don\'t know very far. I haven\'t
really studied these problems; they\'re often easier to dismiss than
study.)

[snip: my advocacy of refraction]

Two issues here:

1) Micrometeorites: These will in fact degrade reflective surfaces
significantly. (Degradation of ablative surfaces will not be significant
compared to what lasers do.) Reflective sand will in fact get arround
this problem. But so will a spray-on version of it that periodically
re-coats your hull. This spray on version will have one BIG advantage
over sand; all of it will provide protection to your ship, not just the
miniscule part of it that happens to intersect a thin strand of laser
light. And that protection will stick around, and not be blown off into
space. You can also get around this problem (and the problem of making
your spaceship too "shiny") by putting your ablative armor over your
reflective armor.

2) Realism: No one can seriously accuse any incarnation of Traveller of
realism. As far as I am concerned, this is not a problem for any /game/
based on /fiction/ (science or otherwise). This is the main reason I
advocate a simple HG-like design system; the added complexity of more
elaborate systems does not get you any more realism. The issue, as I see
it, is not realism but consistency. Traveller already has rules for
ablation and reflection of starship attacks; these rules are covered by
the armor design systems. If sand works the same way as armor, then the
rules for it should both: (a) work the same way as armor, and (b) take
into account that sand is more diffuse than ordinary armor.

Pardon me for being unnecessarily cryptic. ALL armor (both in real life
and in games) works by one or more of these three methods: [A]
reflecting an attack (like a sword bouncing off a helmet, or a laser
reflecting off a mirror), [B] ablating an attack (like a shell exploding in
a rampart, or a laser stopped by a brick wall), or [C] redistributing an
attack (like a sword which cannot cut through chainmail). For most (but
not all) modern warfare, [A] and [B] matter more than [C]. Therefore, I
assume that in starship-to-starship combat, armor works by reflecting
and ablating the incoming fire.

This is ablation. As I said, I think it is not cost effective to blow
your ablative armor out into space, as opposed to keeping it near your
hull. Dense ablative armor works better against a focused attack than
diffuse ablative armor. The stopping power of ablative armor will always
be proportional to the its mass-per-unit-surface-area. By blowing your
armor ("sand") into space, you are increasing its surface area more than
you need to.

I may or may not be creative enough to use TNE. This issue is irrelevent
since I never will. But the more complex you make any system (whether CT,
MT, TNE, or T4), whether by adding unnecessary detail or confusing design
sequences, the more likely it is that you will introduce
inconsistencies. And intelligent players will exploit inconsistencies,
sometimes to the detriment of the game. It is therefore desirable to
minimize confusion and detail, except where they add directly to the
enjoyability of the game.

The volume factors table shows a 4.0 Displacement having a USP of 7, but on
page 74 under paragraph "Agility" there is a small table that shows that a
Displacement of 4 having a USP of 6....Which table is the more correct if
there is one?

Item 2:page 68 errata
On under the Vehicle Communicator Table a Far Orbit has cost of 90KCr and a
volume of .01 at T-14. But on the same page under paragraph Communicators
it states "communicators ...., and a cost of .5MCr per 1m3,...." Lets see
table says 90KCr, but the math says cost is .01m3 X .5MCr =.005MCr or 5KCr.
That is a little price difference maybe 90KCr versus 5KCr.

Item 3:page??? errata?
Where is the mass per 1m3 for sensors? I have not found it on in the
sensors section or on the worksheet. I have used the same mass as
communicators.

Item 4:page 68 clarification
Under communicators it states that vehicle comms "These numbers are for
full capability starship-equivalent units,... Does this mean that vehicle
comms are or are not equal to military grade? To me it does seem to be very
clear?

Item 5:page 69 clarification
Laser Comms do not get the options of Directional Antenna and Direction

Item 6:clarification
I take a Disp 100t, radically slope all surfaces except top and bottom, its
remaining volume puts it in the Disp of 20t. Its cross sectional area is
closer to Disp 20 rather than 100. This was also an issue in Striker I.
Would not sloping increase the surface area available?

Item 7:page 67 errata/clarification

There seems to be a difference 8 versus 27 times volume.

Unfortunately this is no longer true, thanks to the changes in the ship
design system. Well, a jump ship is still much weaker than a battlerider
ton for ton because of the extra fuel tankage, but that\'s not very important
because fuel tankage hardly costs anything (just the hull itself). The 
important thing is how much punch you can get for your money. And for some 
reason the cost of jump drives have been reduced by NINETY PERCENT!! (Count 
them, 90!!) in the QSDS system. (I assume that the price reduction was
already introduced in FF&S, but I never designed a ship with that, so I 
didn\'t notice it then). That means that suddenly jump ships are only a few
percent inferior, credit for credit, than a battlerider.

I don\'t know if I\'ve mentioned this before, but I really, really dislike
changes in the design systems that has a profound impact on the background.
Like this price change. Or like the bridge with a minimum size of 20 T that 
is suddenly no longer necessary in starships, which means that Jump-5 and
Jump-6 X-boats become practical the moment the proper TL is reached.

Does anyone know the reasons for these changes? Did they fix some other,
major problem in the background? Because if they merely made a bit more
sense to the designers when taken on their own, then IMO the extra _loss_
of consistency when taken in conjunction with the Traveller background
ought to have ensured that they weren\'t changed.

Don\'t get me wrong, I\'m not opposed to all change. Not even to some pretty
radical changes. But the more radical the change, the greater the benefit
must be to justify it. And if the changes can help make other parts of the
background more plausible then that is good (For example, I\'d advocate
changing the per ton price of jump drives to 1 MCr times the square of the
jump number. That is, MCr1/T for jump-1 engines, MCr4/T for jump-2 engines,
MCr9/T for jump-3 engines, etc. This would make jump-1 ships cheaper, which 
would cause some problems, but it would also make most military ships more
expensive, which would help reconcile TCS budgets with the size of the
Imperial Navy as it is described in _Rebellion_.

find out what they say about sandcasters:

CT Book 2 (Starships) Ed2 - Sandcasters "dispense small particles which
counteract the strength of lasers and protect the ship".

CT Book 5 (High Guard) Ed2 - sandcasters "project a granular agent which
obstructs light; when fired it interferes with incoming laser and energy
weapon fire."

MT Referee\'s Manual - identical to High Guard.

SOP - More flowery (!) version of High Guard description.

TNE - "sandcasters fire canisters of magnetic ablative crystals. Each
sandcaster contains a generator which creates an EM field which manipulates
the location and shape of the cloud of crystals. These clouds are placed in
the path of incoming beam weapons, and cause the beam weapon to expend its
energy burning through the cloud. The sandcaster operator uses laser
warning sensors to detect fire control locks and anticipate incoming beam
fire."

FFS - basically adds to the TNE description that the EM field generator may
be replaced with a gravitic one at high TLs, "allowing the use of more
effective, non-magnetic crystals".

T4: Does not describe how they work.

T4-starships: Nothing again.

So what can we conclude? I think that the actual operation of the system is
meant to be similar to the 2300AD StarCruiser Force Fields (Magnetically
suspended particles). The trigger appears to (officially) be the targeting
laser beam. personally, I feel that this is unlikely, as the travel times,
even for lasers, are going to significantly mess up target solutions
(target beam there, target beam back, laser fire there, and all the time
the enemy could be manouevering, especially now that thruster plates are
back!). I still think that the predictive system is more realistic.

See p. 90 of T4 for a description of how sandcasters do their job.  It\'s

I\'d like to propose a new format for the USP, if I may.  This is an
expansion and extension of the current USP, to get a lot of the missing
details back into the ship description.

Please read over this, and let me know what you think.

                                      ## Armor, ## Structure

Crew Detail: ## Command, ## Sensors, ## Gunners, ## Engineer, ## Steward
             ## Troops, etc as needed ...

Notes: Explanations and details of the above as needed.

Additional comments and description of the ship may follow in additional
paragraphs.   USPs and comments for carried craft follow.


Thoughts on USPs in general:
I think the description and notes are much better at the end, rather than at
the top (above the name or class).  This allows the start of an entry to be
visually distinctive - much easier for the referee to locate when he or she
needs the information in a hurry.

Generally, a USP will be for either a single ship (in which case the ship
name should appear in the title), or for an entire class (in which the class
name should appear instead of the ship name).  For example, "Empress Marava
Free Trader" (a single ship), or "Beowulf-class Free Trader" (a class).

Particularly for designs that will be shared with others, the design system
used (QSDS, SSDS, or something else) should be noted.  It\'s convenient to
put it up in the title.

This is just a personal thing, but I prefer the units to appear after the
number (just like they taught me in Engineering school), instead of before
it.  I\'ll concede that the other way is easier for spreadsheets, though.
It\'s no big deal to me either way.

You can consider "Std" to stand for "Standard Tons Displacement".  ;-)

IF the ship has a bridge, you should note "(Bridge)" after the controls.
Advanced designs with things like CIC (Combat Information Center), Fighter
Control Bridge, Fire Control Bridge, or Flag Bridge should mention them on
the controls, or (if there isn\'t room), in the notes.

I\'m undecided on the way of formatting the second half of the entry.  The
original (T4) USP had them as "## Rating", but many people seem to prefer
"Rating: ##".  I don\'t particularly care, but think that the first MIGHT be
easier to read quickly.

The Jump drive should be rated in parsecs, and include the number of dTons
of fuel per parsec jumped (this is easy to figure, but is nice to add, since
for some designs the ship may have fuel for more than one jump).

Maneuver drive should also specify what type of drive (Fusion Rocket,
HEPlaR, T-Plate) it is.  If the ship does NOT have Contra-Grav, this should
also be noted in the maneuver drive line (as "No CG").  The default
assumption is that most or all ships in Traveller have contra-grav, since it
makes landings and takeoffs much easier and safer.

Knowing the output of the power plant in Mw is a nice thing to have; for
QSDS designs, it\'s helpful to put something like "2x100Mw" or "100Mw+50Mw".

Fuel should be listed in DISPLACEMENT TONS!  If scoops or refining
capability is present, list the capacity (in dtons scooped per hour, or
dtons refined per hour), like "Scoop 150, Refine 10" or "S 150, R 10".

Sandcaster rating should include the total number of cans available.

Sensor ratings should include a note about stealth or masking (if
installed).  For future expandability, this entry should be "-1 Stealth" or
"-3 Masking" (currently the only available types are stealth for -1DM or
masking for -3DM, but others may be possible in the future).

I strongly recommend adding the crew detail, no matter what format you 
use for your USPs.  Knowing the crew detail helps a LOT when trying to
decide if the ship is suitable for a given party.


Battery listings.  Yes, well.  I\'m advocating a new format of the battery
listing, that also does away with the fire-control rating.  It\'s a bit
different than the current one, so bear with me while I explain:

This is the format for a laser, particle acellerator, or meson gun battery:
##x BatteryName (##) #/##-##-##-## 
Example:
 1x Laser Carronade (+4) 1/4-1-1-0

The first number ("1x") is the number of such batteries installed; on a
large ship, you could easily fill the page by listing all 30 or so laser
batteries individually.  The text ("Laser Carronade") describes the weapon
system.  The number in parentheses is the total bonus (for fire-control,
rate of fire, or other factors) for this battery.  For current design
systems, just put the appropriate Fire Control Rating here, since that\'s the
only bonus that applies.  This will let you mix "civilian" fire-control
rating 0 weapons with "military" weapons on the same ship.  The last 5
numbers are the hits and penetration of the weapon; the first number (in
front of the slash) is the number of hits.  This is the number of rolls on
the damage tables if the weapon hits.  For all current lasers, the damage
is 1, and for all current particle acellerators and meson guns, it\'s 2.  The
last 4 numbers are the penetration at each range.  Please use dashes to
separate these numbers, not slashes, even with the old USP format!

This is the format for a missile battery:
##x BatteryName (##) ##/##       
w/ ##/##x MissileName #/# #G##  
Example:
 1x Missile Barbette (+4) 20/20 
 w/ 20 Guided DetLaser 1d6/2 6G12

The "1x", text, and fire-control bonus mean the same as above.  The last two
numbers on the first line ("20/20") refer to the number of missiles that can
be launched by the battery in one turn, and the number that can be guided
simultaneously.  This battery (which has 4 turrets and 5 MFDs), has 20
launch tubes, and can guide 20 missiles at once.

The second line specifies the type of missiles available (if a battery is
loaded with multiple types, each type needs its own line.  The first symbol
("w/") simply means "with".  The next number ("20") is the number of
missiles available.  The text ("Guided DetLaser") is the name of the missile,
and gives the guidance type.  The next group ("1d6/2") gives the number
of hits (rolls on the damage table) and penetration of the missile (current
detonation-laser missiles have 1d6 hits, while all other types do 1 hit). 
The last group ("6G12") gives the performance of the missile: this missle
can make 6Gs acelleration, and has enough fuel for a total of 12G-turns
(generally 6Gs for 2 turns).


Finally, I\'ve also proposed a way to detail the ship\'s facilities and
carried craft.  Each line specifies the number of such facilities installed,
names them, and names or describes the craft carried.  Here are some
examples:

 1x Launch Port (50-ton fighter)
 2x Launch Tube (50-ton Fighter)
24x Spacious Hangar (50-ton Fighter)

This describes a ship (a carrier, perhaps) that has a single launch port for
use when the dual launch tubes are blocked or inoperable, and hangars for
24 50-ton fighters.

A subsidized Merchant might well be listed with:

 1x Streamlined Grapple (20-ton Boat)

Yes, please!  This fixes so many things that I thought were nuts in the 
original USP.  I hope this becomes standard in the reprints of T4 and 
Starships!

Thank you, Guy!

Water is course the critical item.  You cna live a very long time on short
rations as long as you have potable water.

Out of curiosity, where do you get the 80% figure?  I would think even at
High Stellar levels it would be much lower.

The modern US Navy has a long traditon of good food.  I know a former Soviet
sailor whose tales of Russian Naval cusine would curl your toes.  Also there
is the bulk factor, you need a certain amount of raw mass to keep an active
body healthy.  I learned this the hard way during chemotherapy.

This appeared in an email and I thought it important enough to send 
along to everyone I can think of.

        A very important matter is currently under review by the FCC. 
Your 
local phone company has filed a proposal with the FCC to impose a per
minute 
charge for your internetd service.  They contend that your usage has or
will 
hinder the operation of the telephone network.

        It is my view that the use of the internet will be severely
damaged 
by this if users are required to pay additional perminute charges.

        The FCC has created an emali box for your comments.  Responses
must 
be received by February 13, 1997.

        Send them to:   isp@fcc.gov  

        Tell them what you think.

        EVERY phone company is in on this one!  And, they are trying to
sneak 
it in just under the wire for litigation.  Let EVERYONE you know hear
about 
this.  Email this to them and forward it to all the newsgroups you can. 
Let 
us all present a united front of this attempt to limit our FREEDOMS!!

Earlier this month on 037-000  XTech Industries and Founder Ship Works
made an offer to several major Ship Building Firms for the creation of
The Imperium Ship Builders Association.  The response was very
positive and even succeeded in the creation of a new firm on Ordun. 
Because of this response the ISBA Founders now wish to make the ISBA
known to the general public.  The following announcement was made on
034-000.

                            Imperium Ship Builders
                                     Association

The association is to be a non profit organization dedicated to the
advancement of the Ship Building Industry.  This organization is
expected to play  an important  rule in the Imperium since the
industry is the back bone of the Imperium.  Contacted either Founder
Ship Works or X Tech Industries for more information.


The following are examples of the replies.

From the winner of the recent IISS design contest

Capt. Sir Jerami Danjo, CEO of the Phoenix Corporation, announced
Phoenix\'s whole hearted support of the proposed Imperium Ship Builders
Association (ISBA) today. Sir Jerami was quoted as saying:

  "This organization is long overdue, the glue that holds any
   interstellar society together is spaceborne commerce, and the
   substance of that glue are the ships it is carried on. The ship
   building industry has always been at the forefront of technological
   innovation and will be a vital and vibrant force in the new
   Imperium\'s economy......."

The famous Famille Spofulam says

"Famille Spofulam greets with enthusiasm the formation of the
Imperium Ship Builders Association, and wishes to state that it
welcomes this development.  Famille Spofulam Yards, FS\'s shipbuilding
division, is proud to become a member of such a distinguished
organization."

In a private communica obtained by this paper, to Founder Ship Works, 
FeZUnA from the Confederation of Altec  says.

 I\'m game.  

Where do I sign up?


FeZUnA

This make the organization an Installer Organization not just an

Um ... Err ... Well, no.

It\'s an error in QSDS.  :-(

The price is low by a factor of 14; I referenced the wrong cell in the
spreadsheet that generated the jump drive tables for QSDS.  It aparrently
was wrong in every version I put out, and nobody noticed the error
until a few months after T4 was printed.  I didn\'t notice the error until
someone pointed it out to me.

For what it\'s worth, its correct in SSDS and FF&S; it\'ll be fixed in the
next version of QSDS as well.

This is why for the January ship design contest I _had_ to know what design
system people used - so I could correct the price for QSDS ships so that
they could be compared fairly to SSDS designs.  This was important, since
overall price was one of the significant factors in the judging.

So do I; and this error is one that I\'m genuinely embarrased about, because
it\'s something I should have caught very early in the QSDS design phase.
One of the reasons for trying to make QSDS 2.0 a significantly better
product than 1.x is to entice people to switch, even though the 1.x
designs will be cheaper.

It was a 10-ton bridge, and that one wasn\'t my fault, and besides, there\'s a
good political reason for keeping x-boats limited to j-4 and its really not
my fault.  ;-)

Hmm ... interesting proposal.  Why not take it to the Beta list, and see
what the rest of them think?  I _could_ do that in the next edition of QSDS,
but I don\'t want to break with what the NAH folks are doing.  A related
useful change might be to make J-drive surface area a percentage of the
surface area of the ship.

Thanks Wildstar!  Unless anyone has a problem with this format, I\'d like to
propose that we strongly consider this format for the THUDDD contest.  I
personally prefer the "## Rating" format.  I agree too that the sdesign
sequence needs to be included somewhere (like in parenthesis behind the name
or class).

   Generally I take everything posted to newsgroups with a 50 pound (25
kg) block of salt (a grain is far too small).  There is enough urban
legend (things that sound true but aren\'t) circulating around that you
can fill multivolume sets with it.

   How do the phone companies propose to tell the difference between a
guy who dials up a local Internet provider and some 16 year old who is
just keeping the phone tied up for hours talking to their boy/girl
friend?  The answer is that it\'s impossible unless they start charging
for all phone usage above a certain number of minutes (figuring that
heavy users are typically computer geeks cruising the Internet), or if
they force Internet service providers to use certain exchanges within
the calling area--I don\'t know that this is legal.

   When you think about this logically, it would not be in the best
interest of phone companies to charge for access.  Why?  Because here in
the US, cable companies are starting to come on line providing Internet
access.  The minute that the phone companies start charging for access,
people will desert the phone line-based ISPs and simply switch to
cable-based providers (who don\'t charge per minute).  Also, where is the
outrage that you would presume would be expressed by companies like AOL,
Compuserve, etc.over something like this?  As many phone companies are
getting into Internet service provision themselves, charging a service
fee for the use of other ISPs is a anti-trust law suit waiting to
happen, and the FCC would reject the phone companies\' request out of
hand.  

   Surely something like *this* would have made major news in the
business sections of major newspapers, CNN, the wire services, etc. and
yet I have heard nothing about this before.  I am afraid it\'s likely
that all of this is so much Barbara Streisand (BS).  

   I would suggest that rather that badgering the FCC with bogus e-mail,
that instead if you are concerned (and if you don\'t live in the US, you
have nothing to worry about), first send the FCC a short e-mail asking
if it is true, and *then* if it is, send them a note telling them why
you are against it.  If anyone does contact the FCC in this fashion and
the FCC says it\'s BS, then please post the reply here so that our US
subscribers can save some bandwidth.

Harold

This looks like it goes with some of the ideas you were proposing over in
Beta for normalizing weapons from personal to ship.  The penetration values
might get into triple digits for some weapons, mighten they?

Why?  If your hatch gaskets are working properly, a ship in transit is an
utterly closed system; every atom on board at the start of the voyage
stays aboard unless you voluntarily toss it away (e.g., missiles, HEPlaR
reaction mass).  Within the ship\'s environement, you will gradually
accumulate *more* water than you started with, as food metabolism is
(very) basically the conversion of sugarlike molecules into carbon dioxide
and water.  This excess water emerges from humans in two major ways --
respiration/sweating and urination/defecation.  It\'s relatively trivial to
recover water from the latter via distillation; the former winds up in the
ship\'s air supply, from which it may easily be extracted using a cold trap
if nothing more sophisticated is available.

In short, I have no trouble imagining a well-designed spacecraft achieving
90+ percent water reuse efficiency even at TL 8-9.

Within the US Navy, the submariners eat best, and within *that* group, the
boomer jockeys (strategic missile sub crew) do best of all.  Nobody...
*nobody*... wants the crew of a vessel capable of destroying 20 cities to
become disgruntled.  The same might apply (even more so) to military
spacecraft.

The Tech Level that the Jump Drive is built at should affect it\'s cost, as
well.  I would think jump-1 drives would become less expensive as the
current level of technology moves up to jump-2 and jump-3.

I ran a turn of the century naval campaign a few years ago and
did a fair amount of reseach on this. The average figure for
supplies (per person per day) I came up with after looking at
the records of the Grand Fleet stationed at Scapa Flow during
1st WW was 5kg of food and 20kg of water (fresh). On top of this
had to be added routine consumables for the fleet (practice ammo,
maintaince parts etc). From what little I understand of space
flight around 90% to 95% of water used can be recycled. High tech
will not effect food requirements much, moral will suffer if the
crew spend too much time eating high calorie algae. Onboard
hydroponic gardens are likely to provide a portion of the required
food (akin to the livestock carried by 18th and 19th century sailing
ships). Remember that without long term preservative techniques,
fresh food will only last about a week.

Hope this helps some.

I\'m also very concerned about IG\'s prices for shipping.  This tuesday my
C&S 3rd edition copy (ordered from Terry Austin/Hyperbooks Online --
shamless plug) was shipped.  It arrived this saturday morning (five days
for transporting it from the USA to Germany by air mail) and shipping was
$6.95.  C&S3 is easily as large as any of the IG products and Hyperbooks
Online for sure is much smaller than IG.  Therefor they really should be
able to get better prices for shipping (and yes, my C&S3 package was
reasonable packaged).

I think the official book of The Silly Era should be "Star Smashers of
the Galaxy Rangers". I forget the author. Probably Harry Harrison.

To begin with their power source is "Cheddite", a mysterious substance
extracted from cheddar cheese....

Slight problem. You suffer from a common misconception regarding *how*
weapons grade lasers cause damage.

They do *not* "burn through" armor, nor do they boil it off. They hit
it with so much energy that the surface layer *explodes* because it
can\'t get rid of the energy fast enough. Ablative coatings *don\'t* help
except *possibly* in in the case of an underpowered laser on continuous
beam. Because if the beam is powerful enough to damage with a normal
pulse (or beam), the ablative layer will make it *easier* to damage you
because by vaporizing faster, it increases the blast damage.

"Armor" against lasers can any of the following:

Reflective coatings. Trouble is, the slightest scratch or bit of dust
will create a hot spot that negates the effects. You can\'t keep a
sufficiently good surface on a ship that travels thru space at the
speeds ships routinely reach.

Refractory coatings. These are the exact opposite of ablative coatings.
They take a *lot* of energy to vaporize. The downside is that most are
brittle ceramics and make lousy armor. Worse, it was discovered that
many (possibly all) ceramics have a weakness. Hit them with a
surprisingly *low* amount of laser energy at the right frequency and
they crumble. This was first discovered when the Air Force started
working on lasers vs missiles. They discovered that a one *kilowatt*
beam from the laser they were using shattered a standard missile
nosecone. Pure luck that they were using the right sort of laser... :-)
Even if refractory coatings "work" it just means that the layer that
explodes is thinner. You still get the same amount of energy deposited
via the shockwave.

Spaced armor. You let the laser blow a hole in a thin layer of armor
that is seperated from the hull by spacers. As long as the hit isn\'t
too close to a spacer and you don\'t get hit in the same place twice,
they waste their shots blowing away the outer "shell".

Those are the *real world* defenses against lasers. 

"Sand" is just a variant on spaced armor. No matter what, the beam is
going to deposit *some* energy in whatever it hits. Sand has a far more
perfect reflecting surface than your ship can maintain. And when the
energy it can\'t reflect or refract vaporizes it, the "blast" only
affects the individual particles, not the ship (unless you didn\'t have
enough sand in the way).

I go for all the help I can get, which is why *I* would design sand to
have the optimum mix of the properties I listed the other day. The
"crystals" may not reflect or refract *much of the energy, but every
little bit helps.

The ISP numbers would become toll number just like 1-900.  Easy to do this.
 T-Online the German Phone company does it now.

Why would the phone companies care if we went to cable internet access?  We
will still have phones in our homes, but we will just use them less to call
local ISPs.  The phone companies will still receive the basic service fees
but will provide less service (less use).  If I was a phone company I would
think that was a good deal.

        No offense, Jay, but that minnow looks kinda plastic and

discussion!

This week we will be discussing ship to ship combat.  Michael L. 
Galligan, aka TeflonKid will be leading our discussion.  Thank you, 
Michael!

We will be meeting on the Imperium Games website, imperiumgames.com, 
ports 6665 & 6666.  We will begin at 8pm EST.

Future events:

Saturday, February 15, 1997,  Design Workshop II - SSDS 101, CmdrX
Thursday, February 27, 1997, Planetology 101, Doug Berry

As always, if you need help getting on IRC with us, please let me

If the power output and requirements (in Mw) are given for some
items, like power plants, maneuver drives, screens, and such, then I
wonder if there\'s a simple way to include the same information for
other power hogs like sensors, communicators, weapons, and the like,
since power plant hits should reduce power output?

	The power plant surface area requirements were NOT supposed to make it
into Starships. They were added to QSDS as a last-minute idea, so I pasted
them into the first draft of SSDS sent to Don. Almost immediately,
discussion on the GDW-Beta list shot them down, and they were supposed to
be removed.

	IGNORE the surface area requirements in SSDS.

This is yet another example of where SSDS is not only broken, but downright
illogical. I assume the area requirements for starships are for heat sinks
or radiators. Unfortunately, heat sinks and radiators should not be simply
painted on the radiating surface, as they seem to be in SSDS. Instead, they
are typically designed in sheets or stacks perpendicular to the radiative
surface, so as to have vastly more surface area than is on the outside of
the ships. Take a look at a car radiator or the fins on your pentium to see
what I mean.

However, IMHO, thermal radiators on future spaceships is anachronistic
(sorry, Babylon 5). Since space has no conductive medium, using radiative
cooling requires a huge temperature differential between the radiator and
background environment. Also, these things would make starships stand out
nice and bright on sensors. Rather than a huge area with low (~400K)
temperatures, it will be far more efficient to use small areas with high
temperatures (~ 4000K). So we need a radiator that emits as a 4000K black
body, takes a small space, does not itself operate at high temperatures,
and ideally would radiate in a single direction or cone, so that hostiles
can\'t detect us. Such radiators are called lasers.

Using a laser for cooling requires the power plant to be hooked up to a
heat exchanger which converts the waste heat into a form useful for pumping
a lasing medium (this can be done chemically or electrically). The laser
focal array takes only a small amount of area and the cold sink is the
background of space, so the temperature differential (and efficiency) is
very high. The laser is aimed somewhere away from hostile detectors (or
toward friendlies, if your ship is in distress). Most ships will not
generate enough waste heat for the beam to be used offensively, and it is
better to have the beam on all the time than to concentrate it into pulses
like laser weapons do. Also, the lasing medium is likely to be totally
different.

Alas, I cannot take credit for this sensible idea. Robert Forward described
this in one of his books (RocheWorld? I can\'t remember). Look for
"refrigerator lasers". He describes it far more entertainingly than I can.

appears to be that the average call duration used as a network design basis
is approx 5-10 min. Now, in a heavily used exchange, a small number of
Internet using (esp WWW) customers can screw their calcs by taking up
bandwidth and resulting in busy tones for other customers. So the companies
face installing extra bandwidth (which hits their bottom line) or charging
premium rates (which either ups profits to support investment, or
discourages heavy use).

The mechanism I have used is to reduce the cost of whatever by 10% for each
tech level above the introduction tech level. Example: item introduced at
tech level 10 costs 100% of listed price, if made at tech level 11, costs
90%, 12 gets you 80%. One reason why lower jump drives are still popular at
higher tech levels is the reduction in cost. 

Same works going the other way (given the techology exists). A tech level 10
item that is feasible at tech level 9 costs 110%.

I recall the old maps of the Ziru Sirka having four or five "clots" of
space shared between bureaux, which I always figured marked the locations
of significant minor races with independent industry (and millions of
potential consumers....) which all the bureaux wanted access to.

The first "clot" was around Vland, for obvious historical and economic
reasons.  One was around Sylea -- which made that planet a perfect spot
both for a minor human race and for a late capital for the Rule of Man
(centrally located, already inhabited and industrialized).  Another was
smack where the Geonee homeworld lies (Massilia?).  A smaller one was over
in Ley Sector or Empty Quarter, IIRC, just rimward of Antares. 

And the last that I recall was over in Ilelish, fairly obviously centered
on the Suerrat worlds (we know they established an interstellar government
using STL generation ships, so they must have had some significant
presence for the Vilani to absorb/exploit).

I\'d be very excited to have more details on minor human races in T4: it\'s
one of the areas I\'ve always wanted more detail on.  And the Suerrat, with
their more arboreal heritage, seem like a wonderfully familiar yet exotic
set of possible foes.  (If they\'re historical rivals to the early Third
Immperium, it also sets up the Ilelish Revolt later in the canonical
history).

	Sorry, those fins only work to increase the area for CONVECTIVE radiators,
which rely on a working fluid circulating around them to help carry the
heat away. 

	In space, you have to rely on RADIATIVE emission of heat, which means that
fins don\'t work quite as well. You see, the rate of heat emission via
radiation depends on the temperature difference between two objects. If
you\'ve got two fins side by side, much of the area of the fin is only
radiating to the other fin. Since they\'re at the same temperature, your net
loss of heat is ZERO! The only portion of the fin that\'s useful is the part
radiating out to deep space (at 3K).

	Incidentally, SSDS was NOT SUPPOSED TO INCLUDE THE AREA! That change
apparently never got made.

FREEDOM STARSHIPS OPENS FOR BUSINESS

Freedom Starships, a design bureau and consulting firm, opened for
business today. 

The last firm to accepted the offer and the newest firm to date in the
Imperium, Founder Ship Works will welcome their new neighbours on Ordun
and hopes  to work with them in the future.

In interviewing Josphanoer Cailfor the project coordinator for Founder
Ship Works the Syledon Corporate News learned that Founders president
T W Reynolds was very impressed with the response.  He chose CmdrX as
the first Corporation because of their similar interested in advancing
the industry and their long standing friendship.  Together they choice
about a dozen other corporations to approach privately.  
 T W Reynolds truly hopes that the ISBA well succeeded and expand to
 included other industries, organization and people involved in the
 creation of starships. 

One of the main goals of the of ISBA Cailfor said will be the settling
of prices that exist with in the industry.  He pointed out that the
Technologies and methods used in different design philosophies have
hampered the Imperium to long creating confusion and inflated prices. 
The philosophy of the Old High Guard design system is still valid but
is just not completely usable with the new SSDS school of thought . 
If a method could be found that could bring the schools together then
the prices of starships should drop while the quality increases.  This
Cailfor  says will be a great improvement over the current system and
if only this is done then the ISBA has succeeded.

In closing Cailfor says that the first organizational meeting of the
ISBA has yet to be held are there is still lots of work to do.  The
members have to set down the constitution, member qualifications,
locate a head quarters, and set more goals.  Yet the first steps on
the long journey to the strengthening the Imperium has begun.

You may have mentioned this, but if you did, I missed it. I think that
the ability (or lack thereof) of a ship to land on a planet should be
mentioned somewhat prominantly in the USP.

IMHO, the lack of this is the worst omission of the current T4 USP.

Just my $0.02.

Yes.  The way I proposed it on the list with the (old) ship-only system
values, but the listing format and the interpretation of the values would be
the same under the (new) compatible system.

> The penetration values might get into triple digits for some weapons,
> mighten they?

Probably not.  I\'ve done some more numbers, and that cube root in Greg\'s
formula makes the curve REALLY steep as the energy level rises.  I ran the
numbers for a 68,000Mj weapon, and the penetration is only about 65; it\'s
not likely to be possible to build a ship-mounted weapon that hits 99.

So far the only unfortunate thing about the conversion is that it puts most
of the useful ship-scale weapons into penetration value between 30 and 50.
It also tends to make ship combat more \'deadly\' to small civilian ships
(which are likely to have armor values from 15 to 25), but not unacceptably
so, in my opinion.

Hmm. Poor choice of words on my part. "Won\'t work" is too strong. "Not 
practical" is more what I was thinking.

Another poor choice of words on my part. I lumped, in all my previous,
posts, all forms of energy absorption into the structure of a material
(burning, boiling, exploding, deforming) into the term "ablation." While
this may be correct according to Webster, "ablation" has a technical
meaning in space jargon which may not be consistent with my use of the
word. My apologies. Unfortunately, I cannot think of a better word to
describe this class of events, so I\'ll continue to use "ablation", but
I\'ll put it in quotes.

Way cool. I never heard of these.

My strong suspicion is that sand will disperse far more energy due to
refraction than it will due to reflection or ablation.

I agree that every little bit helps. And I agree that sand will reflect
and ablate A LITTLE BIT of laser light. But I think it will refract a /lot/
more. (And what\'s wrong with refraction anyway? Is its insult to canon
THAT severe?)

I also think that, if you really want "ablation" and reflection instead
of refraction and diffraction, then hull armor will serve you much
better than sand ever will. For reflection, hull armor will give you
more cross section per unit of mass than sand can, and for "ablation",
it will give you a more economical stopping power (g/cm^2) than sand.

Also, I have no idea (at TL13+), how reflective sand might work against
X-ray lasers. I think you may have to rely on refraction for X-rays.

Just some more fuel for the flames.

I wish we had a way of doing addiitive damage some how so that huge
missile batteries (400 50 ton bays full or some-such) could be
resolved in an easier fashion.  TCS statistical resolution is an
option, but we might be able to assume that a group of missiles,
working in concert, might do more damage (or hit more often) than
the sum of all single missiles.  The old swarm of missiles
"thinking" together that has been suggested from time to time.  This
would also provide a reason for grouping missiles in larger
batteries instead of always treating them as single units.

   Technically possible yes, but the fact is that *all* toll numbers in
the US are 1-900 (1-800 and 1-888 can be indirect toll, if you are asked
for a credit card number, then you are charged per minute).  The phone
companies in the US like to keep things seperated that way (less
confusing to customers).

>Why would the phone companies care if we went to cable internet access?

1) Many of them are or are in the process of becoming, ISPs themselves. 
This is a major revenue growth area and no one wants to be completely
shut out of it if they think they have a chance at competing.

2) For all the additional money the phone companies have to spend on
extra equipment to carry the load, the fact is that they are making big
bucks (more than they are spending out) from all of the customers that
get additional phone lines installed into their homes (something I fear
I\'ll have to do if my modem useage continues to increase).  Those phone
lines will go away if customers start switching to cable-based ISPs, and
result in a net decrease in revenue.

   Welcome to the aftermath of the TelCom Act.  We will now join the
rest of our international Travellers already in progress....

  Here\'s a story I stumbled across on CNNfn that is related to this
discussion:

Speeding Internet traffic: Coalition says existing technology can be
better used for faster access

January 23, 1997: 3:49 p.m. ET
 
WASHINGTON (CNNfn) - A group of technology experts say demand for
Internet access is not clogging local phone networks. That claim refutes
the position held by regional Bell operating companies. Contrary to
claims by the RBOCs, the Internet Access Coalition said the nation\'s
existing telephone network is capable of handling the increased calling
volume generated by data communications, including Internet traffic.

   "Our findings clearly show that claims of phone network congestion
resulting from Internet traffic and predictions of a \'meltdown\' are
greatly exaggerated," said Lee Selwyn, study author and president of
Economics and Technology Inc. ETI did the study for IAC.

   Selwyn maintains that data communications poses no significant threat
to the effectiveness of the network. Also, the ETI said increased data
traffic has produced additional revenue for local exchange carriers that
far exceed the costs of accommodating the increased loads.

   IAC is composed of technology associations and technology companies
including America Online Inc., Apple Computer Inc., Compaq Computer
Corp., CompuServe Inc., Digital Computer and others. It wants a new
network using more data-friendly technology to be deployed. 

   "We intend to work closely with the FCC and policy makers in Congress
and in the administration to ensure that this country continues to
support the growth and health of our information society," said IAC
steering committee Chairman Paul Misener said.

    'from' => 'Roderick Darroch Elliott',
    'body' => '        OK... it\'s Sunday at 5:30, the voting has slowed to a trickle over
the past 36 hours, and I\'ve got a buncha CV\'s to stuff into envelopes, so
I\'m going to close the polls on the first THUDDD\'s ship selection stage and
open the design phase.  As noted in the title, the Far Trader won by three
votes.  Methinks that Paul, once he takes over after this one, ought to
hold the second THUDDD on the Merc Cruiser.


        So, here\'s what happens next:  you read the design spec, put on
your psionic augumentation headgear, get seriously inspired, and design
something in either QSDS (QSDS\'ers don\'t forget to multiply J-drive cost by
14!) or SSDS to meet it.  Over the next week, until Sunday 16 February,
mail them in to me at the above address.  I\'ll then post all the designs to
the list with judging instructions.  All TML\'ers may vote, and return
results and comments to me via email, with cc\'s going to Paul Walker.  On
Sunday 23 February, Paul and I will independently tally up the votes,
figure out who won, and award the biscuit (courtesy of X-TEK, let us not
forget).

        Then Paul gets to take over and I retire.



The voting (which reads like a real TML who\'s who) went as follows:


        Far Trader: 16 votes: Douglas McCorison, Mark Clark, J.D. Burdick,
Glenn Hoppe, Tim Reynolds, Rob Beck, Andrew Vallance, Timothy Collinson,
Colin Hollands, Doug Berry, Mark Jones, John Snead, Peter Newman, Volker
Greimann, Ross Coburn, Rob Prior (and myself, but I didn\'t count my own
vote).


        Merc Cruiser: 13 votes: Ethan Henry, Guy Garnett, Commander X, Neil
Simpson, Rich Ostorero, Eamon Patrick Waters, Allen Shock, John P. Raynor,
Arthur Murphy, Bruce Johnson, Mused, Brian A. Howard, Peter J. Miller.


        Corsair: 2 votes: Paul Walker, SD Mooney.


        Patrol Cruiser: 2 votes: David Reed, Andrew Boulton.


        Heavy Fighter:1 vote: Lewis Roberts.


Mission Spec:  Near so far as I can tell, a Far Trader must:

a) be capable of Jump-2 or higher,

b) be commercially viable,

c) affordable by non-megacorp purchasers, and

d) since this is Milieu 0, TL-12 max.

        Given that part of the aim behind the THUDDD is to produce some
innovative designs, I don\'t think that we should actually have any other
mission requirements.  THUDDDers may get as innovative as they bloody well
like, but let\'s all bear in mind that you\'ll be judged by your peers on
mission specs b) and c)...

        If enough people feel strongly about it, we could have two separate
competitions going on; one for a "classic" 200td Jump-2 Maneuver-1 Far
Trader, and an "anything goes" open competition.  Let me know in email over
the course of the week and we\'ll see.


Submission Rules (please follow these; it\'ll make life easier for your
fellow TMLers when they\'re judging your entry) :

1) Submissions must follow Wildstar\'s improved USD format (his post on it
is quoted below).

2) Submissions are to be mailed both to myself <rellio@po-box.mcgill.ca>
and Paul Walker <tiger@goldinc.com>.

3) Descriptive text is welcomed, indeed encouraged, but is to be put in
*BELOW* the USD as per Wildstar\'s instructions.

4) QSDS designers take heed; all those failing to multiply J-drive costs by
14 in their final USD will be subject to an unpaid internship at the
Famille Spofulam Product Safety Testing Facility.  This will immediately
void any life insurance policies you might own.

5) SSDS life support requirements should, IIRC, be expressed in Td (but are
mistakenly labelled as being in M^3); so multiply the number you get by 14
to compensate, or else you\'ll wind up alpha-testing the Famille Spofulam
Educational Toys Robomatic(tm) Butcher Knife & Chainsaw Juggling Tutor with
your QSDS buddies.

6) Power plant radiator surface area requirements may be disregarded in
both design systems.

7) I\'m tired and can\'t think of anything else, so if it becomes apparent
that more rules (boo hiss) are needed, I reserve the right to make\'em up as
needed.



        Here\'s Wildstar\'s Improved USD post:

Crew Detail: ## Command, ## Sensors, ## Gunners, ## Engineer, ## Steward
             ## Troops, etc as needed ...

Notes: Explanations and details of the above as needed.

Additional comments and description of the ship may follow in additional
paragraphs.   USPs and comments for carried craft follow.


Thoughts on USPs in general:
I think the description and notes are much better at the end, rather than at
the top (above the name or class).  This allows the start of an entry to be
visually distinctive - much easier for the referee to locate when he or she
needs the information in a hurry.

Generally, a USP will be for either a single ship (in which case the ship
name should appear in the title), or for an entire class (in which the class
name should appear instead of the ship name).  For example, "Empress Marava
Free Trader" (a single ship), or "Beowulf-class Free Trader" (a class).

Particularly for designs that will be shared with others, the design system
used (QSDS, SSDS, or something else) should be noted.  It\'s convenient to
put it up in the title.

This is just a personal thing, but I prefer the units to appear after the
number (just like they taught me in Engineering school), instead of before
it.  I\'ll concede that the other way is easier for spreadsheets, though.
It\'s no big deal to me either way.

You can consider "Std" to stand for "Standard Tons Displacement".  ;-)

IF the ship has a bridge, you should note "(Bridge)" after the controls.
Advanced designs with things like CIC (Combat Information Center), Fighter
Control Bridge, Fire Control Bridge, or Flag Bridge should mention them on
the controls, or (if there isn\'t room), in the notes.

I\'m undecided on the way of formatting the second half of the entry.  The
original (T4) USP had them as "## Rating", but many people seem to prefer
"Rating: ##".  I don\'t particularly care, but think that the first MIGHT be
easier to read quickly.

The Jump drive should be rated in parsecs, and include the number of dTons
of fuel per parsec jumped (this is easy to figure, but is nice to add, since
for some designs the ship may have fuel for more than one jump).

Maneuver drive should also specify what type of drive (Fusion Rocket,
HEPlaR, T-Plate) it is.  If the ship does NOT have Contra-Grav, this should
also be noted in the maneuver drive line (as "No CG").  The default
assumption is that most or all ships in Traveller have contra-grav, since it
makes landings and takeoffs much easier and safer.

Knowing the output of the power plant in Mw is a nice thing to have; for
QSDS designs, it\'s helpful to put something like "2x100Mw" or "100Mw+50Mw".

Fuel should be listed in DISPLACEMENT TONS!  If scoops or refining
capability is present, list the capacity (in dtons scooped per hour, or
dtons refined per hour), like "Scoop 150, Refine 10" or "S 150, R 10".

Sandcaster rating should include the total number of cans available.

Sensor ratings should include a note about stealth or masking (if
installed).  For future expandability, this entry should be "-1 Stealth" or
"-3 Masking" (currently the only available types are stealth for -1DM or
masking for -3DM, but others may be possible in the future).

I strongly recommend adding the crew detail, no matter what format you
use for your USPs.  Knowing the crew detail helps a LOT when trying to
decide if the ship is suitable for a given party.


Battery listings.  Yes, well.  I\'m advocating a new format of the battery
listing, that also does away with the fire-control rating.  It\'s a bit
different than the current one, so bear with me while I explain:

This is the format for a laser, particle acellerator, or meson gun battery:
##x BatteryName (##) #/##-##-##-##
Example:
 1x Laser Carronade (+4) 1/4-1-1-0

The first number ("1x") is the number of such batteries installed; on a
large ship, you could easily fill the page by listing all 30 or so laser
batteries individually.  The text ("Laser Carronade") describes the weapon
system.  The number in parentheses is the total bonus (for fire-control,
rate of fire, or other factors) for this battery.  For current design
systems, just put the appropriate Fire Control Rating here, since that\'s the
only bonus that applies.  This will let you mix "civilian" fire-control
rating 0 weapons with "military" weapons on the same ship.  The last 5
numbers are the hits and penetration of the weapon; the first number (in
front of the slash) is the number of hits.  This is the number of rolls on
the damage tables if the weapon hits.  For all current lasers, the damage
is 1, and for all current particle acellerators and meson guns, it\'s 2.  The
last 4 numbers are the penetration at each range.  Please use dashes to
separate these numbers, not slashes, even with the old USP format!

This is the format for a missile battery:
##x BatteryName (##) ##/##
w/ ##/##x MissileName #/# #G##
Example:
 1x Missile Barbette (+4) 20/20
 w/ 20 Guided DetLaser 1d6/2 6G12

The "1x", text, and fire-control bonus mean the same as above.  The last two
numbers on the first line ("20/20") refer to the number of missiles that can
be launched by the battery in one turn, and the number that can be guided
simultaneously.  This battery (which has 4 turrets and 5 MFDs), has 20
launch tubes, and can guide 20 missiles at once.

The second line specifies the type of missiles available (if a battery is
loaded with multiple types, each type needs its own line.  The first symbol
("w/") simply means "with".  The next number ("20") is the number of
missiles available.  The text ("Guided DetLaser") is the name of the missile,
and gives the guidance type.  The next group ("1d6/2") gives the number
of hits (rolls on the damage table) and penetration of the missile (current
detonation-laser missiles have 1d6 hits, while all other types do 1 hit).
The last group ("6G12") gives the performance of the missile: this missle
can make 6Gs acelleration, and has enough fuel for a total of 12G-turns
(generally 6Gs for 2 turns).


Finally, I\'ve also proposed a way to detail the ship\'s facilities and
carried craft.  Each line specifies the number of such facilities installed,
names them, and names or describes the craft carried.  Here are some
examples:

 1x Launch Port (50-ton fighter)
 2x Launch Tube (50-ton Fighter)
24x Spacious Hangar (50-ton Fighter)

This describes a ship (a carrier, perhaps) that has a single launch port for
use when the dual launch tubes are blocked or inoperable, and hangars for
24 50-ton fighters.

A subsidized Merchant might well be listed with:

 1x Streamlined Grapple (20-ton Boat)

subject.

Power Plant surface area is BROKEN in both QSDS and SSDS.  It was added to
the systems late, and last-minute playtesting showed us that it was a bad
idea.  It was supposed to have been removed from both QSDS and SSDS before
they were printed, but this correction didn\'t make it.

To repeat:
IGNORE power-plant surface area requirements in BOTH QSDS and SSDS.


Power plant surface area requirements for vehicles and spacecraft designed
with the vehicle design system (published in the _Central Supply Catalog_)
remain, however.


Comments and opinions:
Note that while the power plant surface area doesn\'t work in Traveller
from a game-design standpoint (it invalidates large starships), from
the standpoint of real-world physics, it\'s required: every megawatt of
power generated onboard a ship has to leave somehow, or else the occupants
of the ship are going to get cooked.

In space, the only way to get rid of heat is to radiate it overboard, and
this is a fuction of how hot we can make the radiators (since we can\'t do
anything about the temperature of space), and how much of the hull\'s area
we can devote to them.  Although a pair of cooling wings would help,
closely-spaced "fins" like on the heat-sink of a computer chip only work
in an atmosphere.

In the Naval Architect\'s Handbook, it\'s likely that some consideration will
be given to this entire question, but for now, for SSDS and QSDS, we can
ignore it, and assume that whatever solution the Imperium\'s engineers come
up with, it doesn\'t require very much surface area.

Under the current T4 space combat system, lasers don\'t get a penetration
bonus.  I\'m currently working on a new system that more accurately reflects
the capabilities of lasers (and also recociles the vehicle/personal and
starship combat scales).

> What is the damage difference between beam and pulse lasers?

In T4 (like in T:TNE before it), there are no "beam" lasers; all lasers are
pulsed, with rates of fire between 10 and 800 pulses per combat turn.

Given the ranges involved in space combat, and the strength of the average
starship\'s hull, a continous-beam laser would either have to be held on the
target an unacceptably long time, or would require an unacceptably high
amount of energy input.

It\'s a better idea to store up the power and fire pulses every few seconds
that are intense enough to damage the target if a single pulse hits.

That\'s covered by the configuration.  The ship\'s configuration; and in
particular the part where it says "unstreamlined" (usually "USL"),
"streamlined" ("SL"), "airframe" ("AF"), or "planetoid".  This is NOT in the
current T4 USP, but is definitely included in every "enhaced" USP that\'s
been proposed.

The streamlining affects a ship\'s ability to land on a planet thusly:

Planetoid hulls may NOT land on any planet safely.  Attempting to do so will
probably destroy the hull.  Planetoids may not skim for fuel.

Unstreamlined hulls may not safely land on any world with an atmosphere
denser than "trace".  They may land on vacuum worlds ("trace" or thinner) if
they are equipped with Contra-Grav units, or have maneuver drives with
higher acelleration than the planet\'s surface gravity.  Unstreamlined hulls
may not skim for fuel.
Streamlined hulls may skim for fuel, and may land on any world (regardless
of atmosphere), if the ship is equipped with Contra-Grav.  Streamlined ships
that are not equipped with Contra-Grav may only land on worlds where the
drive\'s accelleration exceeds the local surface gravity.

Airframe hulls may skim for fuel, and may land on any world with an
atmosphere of "thin" (or more dense), regardless of the ship\'s Contra-Grav
or maneuver accelleration.  IF the ship is equipped with Contra-Grav or a
maneuver drive with more accelleration than the surface gravity, airframe
hulls may land on any world regardless of atmosphere.

Finally, ships which do NOT have contra-grav face greater risks when
skimming for fuel.  The skimming procedure is no harder without contra-grav,
but the consequences of failure are more severe (frequently resulting in the
loss of the ship).  Airframe hulls can at least partially compensate, since
they offer aerodynamic control during the run through the gas giant\'s
atmosphere.

The referee should implement task rolls for the pilot whenever a ship
attempts an unsafe maneuver, and should determine the subsequent events
based on the outcome of the task.

> IMHO, the lack of this is the worst omission of the current T4 USP.

Will the addition of the configuration, along with the above information,
help?

If this means the entire notion of surface area for power plants is gone,

Arcadia Shipyards Joins the Imperium Ship Builders\' Association

Arcadia Shipyards is please to announce their support of the Imperium Ship
Builders\' Association, as a charter member of that professional association.

"The Imperium Ship Builders\' Association will bring a new level of quality
and professionalism to the starship construction business" said Kodai
L. Tadashi, President of Arcadia Shipyards.  "Arcadia Shipyards supports
the Association wholeheartedly, and our staff will take the opportunity
to continue to build professional relationships with their counterparts
at other firms."

Mr. Tadashi confirmed reports that Arcadia Chief Test Pilot Billy-Joe "BJ"
Wheeler lifted off of Matsumoto downport this morning in the company\'s
research starship (unnamed, but known universally as "The 999" for it\'s
distinctive registry number), with Dr. Tochiro Miyazaki, Arcadia\'s Chief
Designer, Gzoe Zanore, the company\'s Chief Financial Officer, and
several members of the staff for a high-level meeting at an undisclosed
location.  Mr. Tadashi refused due to "the sensitive nature of the
negotiations" to elaborate on the location or other attendees of the IBSA
organizational meeting.

Arcadia Shipyards is a growing starship and spacecraft construction firm,
with facilities on the major worlds of the Arcadia Cluster.  The company\'s
headquarters are located adjacent to their main starship construction yard,
at Matsumoto downport.  The company has extensive orbital yards, located in
Space Stations X and XI in the Matsumoto Orbital Complex.  Arcadia is
best-known for their high degree of vertical integration, from design to
component production through final assemby and certification testing.

Well, I\'m glad to know it. I would have been even more pleased to have known

That one went right by me. Are you going to give people a choice? Surely you
don\'t mean to have two rival ship design systems that produce radically
different prices?!? Why not just include it in the T4 errata right away?

I\'m 98% sure that it was 20 T. 2% of the ship, but minimum 20 T. A 1000 T
ship was the smallest ship not to have a proportionally oversized bridge.
Though it\'s been some time since I designed CT ships, so I may be wrong.
I was wrong about the 40% discount for multiple ships; it\'s only 20% in
both _Book 2_, _High Guard_, and _TCS_. (What is 20% in one and 40% in
the other is the reduction in production time; it\'s 20% in _High Guard_
but 40% in _TCS_).

>and that one wasn\'t my fault, and besides, there\'s a

I never said it was your fault; I do say the political reasons are a crock,
but we\'ve had that discussion already. (Has that one been added to the FAQ?)

Anyway, your fault or not, do you happen to know why the mandatory bridge was 
dropped? Did the gain justify making 100 T jump-6 ships possible and thereby 
messing up the background?

I\'m not an expert, but this is my understanding of what\'s going on:

The FCC, exempted ISP\'s, temporarily, from a special Access Fee back in the
80\'s, that goes to the local phone companies (RBOCs) to offset their costs
of providing (and keeping low charges for) local service.  The reason ISP\'s
were exempted was to encourage the
development of alternative telecommunication networks, specifically the
internet.  Long-distance carriers have been paying an Access Fee all along.

Recently, the RBOC\'s asked the FCC to revisit their decision on ISP\'s not
paying the Access Fee. They argue that the decision was a temporary one and
was meant to encourage growth, and now years later that growth has occurred
so it\'s only fair for ISP\'s to contribute to the load they are placing on
the local telecommunication
infrastructure.  The FCC is considering this request right now, and they
are soliciting comments from interested parties.  Sometime in March they
will decide whether to hold hearings on the subject, make a change, or
leave things as they are.

The Access Fee, if it is imposed, would be on the ISP\'s not the individual
callers.  The ISP\'s would have to pay something like 60 to 90 cents / hour
/ line..who this goes to, I\'m not sure, but
eventually it is supposed to end up in the RBOC\'s pocket.  The RBOC would
use this money to improve local infrastructure and offset costs of
business.  Everyone believes the ISP\'s will pass the access fee on to the
users, though.  This could mean higher flat rates, or even the end of the
flat rate.

ISP\'s argue that the internet is still growing, and should continue to
receive an exemption from paying the fee.  They suggest the RBOCs have as
an ulterior motive, the goal of making it harder for ISP\'s to compete with
them as them enter the internet service business themselves.  

The RBOCs argue that the internet has reached "critical mass" and doesn\'t
need government assistance anymore.  They say that use of phone lines for
data purposes puts severe strain on the sort of systems they have in place. 
The current systems are optimized for short voice communications where
fewer lines are required, but frequent switching is.  They aren\'t optimized
for many long (or continuous) connections, and their lines are being
swamped.  The need to upgrade their systems is obvious, and they say they
*are* proceeding, but the costs of these upgrades should be paid for by
those who will most benefit from them..the ISP\'s and their customers.

I *think* that\'s about it, and I\'ve tried to fairly present both side\'s
arguments.

Someone once told me that ordinary heat sensors ought to be able to detect
starships at ranges far in excess of the ranges allowed by the Traveller
ship combat system (don\'t ask me which one). Is this true? If it is, perhaps
you should consider using some other dimension (jump-space or sub-space or
whatever thrusters thrusts against (no, waitaminute, nowadays thrusters
thrust against gravitational potential or something, don\'t they?). Anyway,
use something other than the universe as a heat sink. It may mess up some
thermodynamic laws a li\'l bit, but so what? If sticking to Real Life
physics means invalidating Really Big Ships then I say stuff Real Life
physics!

Besides, introducing an extra-dimensional heat sink isn\'t really messing up
Real Life physics, is it? It\'s more like adding to them, right ;-)

That would apply to a other-dimensional heat sink, wouldn\'t it?

Gary, this is the sort of thing I usually do too. In fact, I use the 10%
reduction for each tl as well. ;->

I was suggesting that something like this should be including in the ship
design systems...at least as an option.  Other options might include,
systems becoming available in military and government ships before they do
in civilian ships, volumes dropping for lower jump-numbered drives as tech
improves, that sort of thing.  

Finally, I don\'t like the, "one size" fits all model in the tables.  I\'d
like to see some randomization, or at least customization, built in so
different *companies* power plants, drives, sensor suites, etc would have
slightly different characteristics.

In past versions, it\'s been assumed that any ship designed with an
aerodynamic or streamlined hull can land on a planet. Has anyone
found the same statement in T4?

How about roll 2D6-7 (or even 4D6-14) as a percentage change in volume and price for 
different systems?
So you roll for Mused Shipyards (an independent yard, not related to Vates, whoever the 
hell they are) and you get +1% volume, -2% price on jump drives, -1% volume and -4% 
price on thrusters and then +3% volume and price on electronics (they proudly do not use 
the ubiquitous Pentium 12000)

Yeah, I did a "back of the envelope" calculation and you\'re right. Anything
that gets into triple digits is going to be monsterious.

Actually, that\'s probably pretty realistic.  The sort of weapons normally
found on military ships *should* punch right through thin armored civilian
ships.  I\'d *like* a different model (as you probably recall from my Age of
Sail posts), but then again maybe a few quick thrusts through a merchantman
would be enough to disable her without damaging her so badly she can\'t be
repaired.

I think that the Traveller space combat systems since T:TNE have handled
this in a (more or less) correct manner.

In T4\'s basic combat system, as well as the (recommended) Role-Playing Space
Combat system, the game system assumes that starships can detect a "bogey"
at ranges far greater than any starship weapon can fire, and likely beyond
well the edges of any reasonable playing board.

This "bogey detection" is enough to alert the crew that there is indeed
something out there and it\'s approximate location (say, to the nearest hex
or so), but it\'s not exact enough to generate a firing solution.  The
"bogey" is likely an area of space that looks hotter than it has any right
to be.

However, to be able to shoot at that hot-spot with any chance of hitting, we
need more information - a firing solution.  The ability to generate a firing
solution is limited more by the ability of sensors to resolve the target
than to detect it; this in turn is primarily determined by the diameter of
the sensor array (and therefore the overall length of the ship).  This is
why the diameter of the array depends on the range of the sensor (and doesn\'t
change as TL increases), but the area required can be (and is) reduced as
more sensitive detectors are introduced at higher TLs.

Well, that\'s been the consensus on this issue ever since anyone noticed it.
We\'d rather have 500,000-ton ships than a thermodymically defensable means
of handing the heat generated by that 500,000 ton ship\'s fusion plant.  :-)

Right.  ;-)

Yes, it would - but you said it, and not me.  ;-)

Well using a 3G3 spreadsheet you will need a p-beam weapon with a input of
15,980,000,000 joules gving a Dv of 9181 which converting to Y4 is
muliplied by giving a DV of 45900, when converted to T4 pen of 100. A laser
would need an input of 15,000,000,000,000 joules giving a DV of 47958 which
will conver to T4 pen of 101. Also using rocket/missiles you can get into
the triple digit range. I have not updated my spreadhseet to do that
function yet.

will be a general organization created shortly but I hope to open
membership to all parts of the industry.  Including Government,

I just had another idea for that sub-space heat-sink: Wouldn\'t such a thing
work as a sork of cloaking device by reducing the heat signature of the
ship? Perhaps to the point where detection ranges were BACK to the CT
values?

Perhaps you could allow a ship to count each ton of such a heat-sink as X
square meter of surface hull. Any ship that has more "interior" surface
area than needed would reduce it\'s heat signature to zero (Of course, there
are other kinds of detectors, but perhaps they would be shorter ranged?

The price and volume could be worked out to make 1 million T ships the 
largest feasible (at TL 15).

Just a few undigested ideas...

This sounds much too low (I needed a 68,000,000,000,000 joule [68,000Mj]
weapon to generate a T4 penetration of 65 for a starship weapon).  Greg has
mentioned that attempting to build starship-class weapons with 3G3 needs
careful attention to detail.

I suspect that you don\'t have a wide enough beam for any of your designs to
reach to starship combat ranges.  For refrence, a starship combat laser
should have a beam between 1 and 2 meters in diameter.

In the past, Greg has suggested continuing to use the FF&S weapon design
sequences for starship weapons; I am currently working on a way of doing
this and still be able to produce numbers that mesh with the vehicle and
personal combat systems.

Now that you\'ve mentioned it, I\'ve been messing around with a few new map 
ideas I\'ve had... I hope to have 4 new net maps posted by Thursday, 
including a newly-renovated Acropolis.

The bad news is: I haven\'t done any more Traveller themed maps tho\'...
The good news: My new maps don\'t include any Juggernauts :-)

Absolutely!  The problem with doing things this way, is that
*prices* can\'t be completely uniform...nor can volumes, nor
capabilities.  That\'s not a problem in *my* mind, but it might be for some
people. 

And now a word from our sponser...Rannock Reactors (a wholly owned
subsidiary of Rannock House, Ltd.) is proud to announce a successful test
of its prototype CPF (Casimir Pinch Fusion) reactor.  Although commercial
production may be several years away, the new CPF technology promises to be
a "breakthrough" in the direct extraction of electricity from the vacuum. 
In yesterday\'s test the prototype ran for only a few seconds, but operated
at well above "break even" with a heat lose of less than 0.01%.  Stay tuned
for future
announcements.

   OK, so now it\'s all starting to make sense, thanks Eris.  That also
better explains the article from CNNfn regarding the study commissioned
by the IAC.  With the regional Bells squaring off against heavy hitters
like AOL, Apple, Compaq, etc.  It\'s shaping up to be a major war.  May
be time to call up my LCP (local cable provider) and avoid the
firefight.  Besides, I\'m not looking forward to investing in a 56K modem

How do we decide what is commercially viable and what isn\'t? Can we assume
that all staterooms will be full on each trip? Do we always fill up the cargo
hold with freight? What kind of profit can we calculate with if the ship is
used for speculative trade? how many jumps per year can we assume? How do we

How much can non-megacorp purchasers afford?

Can we interpolate non-standard QSDS parts? If we do, do we assume they cost
full price or do we assume that our design will be built in quantities large
enough to get the 25% discount anyway?

Can we use many small power plants or do we have to use the smallest number
needed to get the desired wattage?

  It used to be possible to finesse/scam this effect using the
"Relative Value Table" in TCS, Striker boxed set, and I believe
also a JTAS.  Just order a J1 drive from a TL 9 world to install
at your TL 12 shipyard, and compare the 0.70 : 0.85 value ratio,
and then count your savings after shipping, handling, customs,
piracy, bribery, and entertaining sales reps...

	Another trouble is that absolute 100% reflective surfaces
	do not exist in real world (as far as I know). Usually when
	someone is talking about lasers and mirror, he means
	milliwatt-range lasers. With stronger lasers the unreflected
	percentage of laser energy will heat up the reflective
	surface and may eventually vaporize the surface.

	Example: According to FFS, a laser beam will be focused to
	1 cm2 spot (1.13 cm diameter) within Short Range. Assuming
	that 150 MJ starship lasers can release the laser pulse in
	~1 ns, the whole laser beam will be ~30 cm long. (The lasers
	we are experimenting with in TUT fire ~15 cm long beams.)

	When the beam hits a reflective surface, the unreflected
	percentage of the first millimeters of this 30 cm beam will
	vaporize the reflective surface and render it ineffective.

	Reflective surfaces and reflec armors may be useful for
	protection against laser-guided missiles, but are likely to
	be totally useless against strong pulse lasers.

Hmm, Ooops, The DV of 9181 is multiplied by 5 to get to DV of 45900, I have
cross checked my figures against the 3G3 spreadsheet that a friend has
bought both spreadsheets come up with the same answer, a T4 pen/dam of 100.

Well the laser has input of 15,000,000,000,000 joules or 15,000,000Mj to
get a DV of 47958 which will conver to T4 pen/dam of 101. The beam diameter

You can use 3G3 to design starship weapons you just run the Range class out
beyond an 8.

Much much worse! Don\'t get me wrong, i LOVE Perry, i read it every

From Commander X(pay no attention to the man behind the curtain)

<NOTE things in ** are OOC>

037-0001 DSS-X  AX00513-C "Planet X"

The Imperial Ship Builders Association

X-TEK Industries is proud to announce the formation ot the Imperial Ship 
Builders Association.  On 034, the CEO of Founder Ship Works came to me with 
aproposal via comm channels(**IRC**).  That night I aggreed to join Founder 
in becoming a "founder" or the ISBA.  Although the Commander has been buisy 
with many projects recently, including the very "hush hush" Project Fnord, 
trying to gather new data for the 2nd shipbuilding class(**did you guys 
realy HAVE to change everything before I gave the class? :-)  **) and 
preparing for a conference on VR Holosims on the Imperial Fringeworld of 
Jax(**Jaxcon**), he has been able to engineer the transition to this new 
association.

The Commander understands the belatedness of this release as many Companies 
and Corporations have joined the ISBA in the past 3 days.  The Commander 
Extends his his fondest greetings.

The Commander would also, out of respect and courtesy to the Emperor, 
Officialy Anounce that Cleon Industries be made a "Honorary" Member.  For 
without the backing of Cleon Corp(**Yes Marc, this is for  you! :-)**) none 
of this would be posible.

 The Commander would like to say that at the class on Saturday, this will be 
a SSDS class yes, but some discussion will be made about QSDS and how QSDS 
"packages" are made from SSDS.  Eventualy he would like to get together with 
Mr. "Wildstar" on his QSDS 2.0 and posibly the creation of the USDS. Tthis 
takes parts from QSDS, SSDS, and VDS, and amalgams them together into a 
Unified Ship Design System. (**Prolly just FF&S sans guns**) This is 
basicaly the way the Commander has been making his ships: Take a standard 
QSDS hull, or create a custom SSDS hull, put in propulsion systems (QS or 
SS), the Commander Prefers the QSDS weapons packages, but custom weapons are 
being requested every day.  Hmmm, see a patern forming?

The Commander Proposes that items from QSDS get a 20% discount and those 
from SSDS get none at all.   QSDS is "Factory Standard"  while SSDS is 
"Custom Handmade"  Obviously something custom should cost more.

All this and more will be discussed at the class,The CommanderI will be 
loging it so that he can get the latest changes/errata/updates as the class 
builds the Free Trader.

A Quote from the Commander:

"Whats this about charging 14x more for QSDS J-drives?  (Cha-CHING!!!)"
The Commander had a wicked "credit gleam" in his eye as he said this.

The Commander would like to Announce the proposals for 2 new ship designs. 
 Both of wich are part of the new "Year One" Family of ships.

The FT-1 "Cyrano" Class 200Td  Far Trader
The HFB-1 "Claymore" 800Td  Class Merc Cruiser.  (Whats HFB? You\'re not 
cleared for that information.)

The Commander would also like to ask Mr. Scott Galiand if he could update 
his QSDS forms to include the new format proposed by Mr. Wildstar.

Both ships  will become availble after the prototypes have been delivered to 
the ISBA THUDDD compound for testing and analysis.

Greetings fellow ISBA\'ers.

I have but one thing that is perplexing me with regards to dates of press 
releases ,anouncemnets, and other ISBA relate role playing thingies.

Planet X seems to be in a time dilation loop,  my dates are 0001, everyone 
else in 0000.  Perhaps I assumed incorrectly that year zero started when T4 
was released back in September.  We need to find out what the "official" 
date is.  I could be incorect, and year zero starts with the relase of "M:0" 
( which I believe is due today, Feb 10th?)

It is no problem to change to year zero for me,  its just that my old Slyean 
Windows-650 can\'t understand that its Year Zero and not 651!  :-)

    'body' => 'I saw some recent articles on Battlecruisers and Battleships, and did some
reaserch on my own about the different uses of military vessles in relation
to their class types. I came across an old edition of Knight\'s Modern
Seamanship, one from 1941. This was the edition published right before the
Japaneese Attack on Pearl Harbor, so the military doctrine at the time was
similar to the type of thinking that would govern military designs of the
Imperium, barring the differences in technology.

These definitions are compiled from various entries from Knight\'s and some
other input from various encyclopedic sources (Brittanica, New world, etc.)
In addition, I have noted what each vessle would likely require in Traveller
terms, as well as their possible uses.

Battleships: main line vessles requiring the highest firepower and armor 
avaliable. First priority is armament, then armor, then speed. All else is 
sacrificed to this end. These vessles would form the backbone of any naval
force, and would include a few vessles built to grand scale and called
"Dreadnoughts".

Most powerful spinal mount available.
Many high firepower bay weapons.
Heaviest armor economically available.
Most economical maneuver and jump available.

Battlecruisers: Scouts and flanking vessles. Main requirement is speed, 
then firepower, and last, armor. Usually seen as light battleships. These
vessles would scout a known hostile system, searching for enemy presence,
then, once reporting the presence to the main force, shadow and weeken the
force until the battleship\'s arrive. Some forces composed of only
Battlecruisers and operating independently could operate as a comerce raider
behind enemy lines.

Fastest maneuver drive economically available.
Above average jump drive.
Above average to heaviest spinal mount.
Moderate armor.


Heavy Cruiser: Usually little distinction is given between Heavy Cruisers 
and Battlecruisers, but there is a difference. Heavy Cruisers are more 
lightly armed and more attention given to speed. Useful as a courier were 
other vessles could not safely pass. They can also operate in the comerce
raider role, similar to the Battlecruiser. These would also form the core of
any military exploration and frontier defense force. Note that the USS
Enterprise from Star Trek is refered to as a Heavy Cruiser in most texts
related to the series, and is seen frequently operating far from home along
the frontier.

Highest jump economically available.
Above average maneuver drive.
Above average firepower.
Moderate armor.

Light Cruisers: first line of contact with the enemy, screening Battleships 
from other cruisers and smaller vessles. When a force of vessles finally
close with it\'s enemy, these would be the ships to take on the SDB\'s and any
other vessles attempting to outflank the force.

Many above average firepower batteries.
Fast maneuver drive.
Jump drive equal to the Battleships they operate with.

Cruisers: a general purpose category for ships talored to a specific 
mission and environment. Command Cruisers are one such example - moderate 
firepower with emphasis on communication and control suites.

Destroyers: With capability to operate alone, such as in mop-up operations 
and in low-threat interdiction missions, and with the fleet, as a flanking 
unit and screen from SDB\'s and fighters, supporting the Light Cruisers. In a
military campaign, these would be the vessles left behind to ensure all
SDB\'s are mopped up. Also, if the threat is deemed low enough, the entire
task force which strikes an area could be made up of Destroyers, with a few
Battlecruisers for fire support, leaving the main task force to conduct
operations in more hostile areas.

Many moderate firepower batteries.
Fast maneuver drive.
Above average endurance for long patrols.

The below on Frigates, etc is compiled somewhat from my own gaming
experience as well as encyclopedia references on their historical uses. 

Frigates: Special type of destroyer used for escorting unarmed or lightly 
armed merchants or auxileries in moderare threat environments and to assist 
destroyers in patrol missions. They have been refered to historically as
Destroyer Leaders and Destroyer Escorts. Frigates are useful along frontier
areas where there is a known threat to shipping.

Long endurance.
Maneuver and jump drives as to efficiently operate as screen.

Corvette: Small destroyer-type vessle used as a frontier patrol vessle and 
as a main fleet vessle for small governments. Useful as a raider by moderate 
sized governments. Useful in threat environments where a force of Heavy
Cruisers would be overkill.

Good maneuver drive.
Above average jump drive, preferably with multiple jump capability.

Gunboat: Similar in size and firepower to Corvettes, but more used in 
custom and self defense roles for smaller interstellar governments that need 
supliments to their SDB fleets. Very usefull in an undeveloped or frontier
Main area.

Average maneuver, jump drives, and firepower based on tech, economy, and need.

Couriers: built for speed, these vessles free up Heavy Cruisers for military 
use instead of messanger duty. (Did I hear Xboat?)

It must be noted that the reference to average and such will be different
from situation to situation. A good military planner must weigh threat
against economy when designing vessles.

Just my $0.02 worth... :)

Why would you have CG _and_ thrusters? Aren\'t thrusters

First, I think this will be up to each voter when they vote.  Second, as a
suggestion (not a THUDDD pronouncement :) I would reccommend using 80%
occupancy for all passengers and cargo areas for income (assume mid & lo
passage only and 1500 Cr for freight/cargo combination).  That is the income
side of the balance sheet so to speak.  Then on the other side, use the
standards listed in T4 assuming a skill of 2 for the crew.  This should give
a basic idea of whether the ship is making a profit or not.  If anyone
doesn\'t quite understand this, I can post a more detailed example.

>>c) affordable by non-megacorp purchasers, and

I think this is purely speculative.  This one will probably be decided on by
you as the judge.  That is to say, you will judge whether everyone elses
design is affordable or not when you vote.

This one I think Roderick will have to answer.

I ran into this problem last night when I was designing my entry into the
THUDD.  Also, an addition to the above questions, how many cargo\\passenger
trips per month can a ship do?

I had my costs per month at around KCr150, and, with 10 high passenger suits
(50,000 per journey) plus, I think around 80 tons of cargo space (80,000
according to T4 trade rules), I make Cr130,000 per journey.  How many
journey\'s can we assume the ship can make per month.

FIRST PRESS RELEASE

        Today, the Fuzhon Institute for Research in Space Technologies
announced that it would be joining the newly formed ISBA.  Fuzhon sited many
reasons for the decision, not the least of which was the host of
high-profile companies that have joined in the past few days.
        Said, Doctor Robert Fuzhon, director\\founder of FIRST, "We at the
Insititute realized that, in the case of the ISBA it appeared we risked
being left behind in the ship building industry, which we cannot afford to
do if we are to continue our academic and commercial operations."
        The decision was not made lightly said Fuzhon, stating that it had
been put to the general school populace in a peblisite, and, after a
resounding yes vote was given, the board of directors, operating on Fuzhon\'s
proposal unanimously agreed to peition for entrance in the ISBA.

Multiply by 14! Is this one of the official corrections to QSDS?  I didn\'t

Maybe I\'m missing something...I tuned into Bab 5 for about the whole first
season, and the beginning of the second, in the hope that the script would
improve, or the plots would improve, to no avail.  The characters were
utterly predictable, the Commander was 2-dimensional, and yet the focus of
the story line.  There was one alien who was at least a good actor.  The
special effects were excellent, but not, alone, worth an hour of my time.

I have since tuned in occasionally, without being impressed.  (maybe the
Bruce Willis lookalike turns me off:)

Did 2nd or 3rd season improve that much? or are our tastes just that
different?  I agree, for the record, with all you guys have said about DS9
nad Voyager.  As I\'ve always said, the writing is what counts, and the
scripts for DS9 and Voyager (and TNG in fact!) were quite weak at the
start. 

Am I just an alien?

I don\'t.

This opens the door to controllable tractor fields, which will have a
significant effect on the designs of starships.

Not to mention being abused by players to no end.

No, I\'ll stick to my magnetic fields and suffer the consequenses (50

If the ships dump waste heat at high temperature through a limited surface
area, yes; and this seems to be the canon answer.  It\'s possible to shed
the same amount of heat at lower temperature through a greater surface
area, but the surface area requirements are truly enormous if you\'re
shooting for a stealthy IR signature.  This would involve devoting some
significant fraction of ship volume/mass specifically to heat radiators, a
detail which doesn\'t show up in FFS.

An interesting sidelight:  When Kubrick\'s production team designed
Discovery for _2001_, they consulted with real aerospace engineers to make
their vessel as plausible as could be managed.  One of the first things
they learned was that their fusion drive would require *big* radiator fins
to shed waste heat.  In the original Discovery model, these were present
as four large rectangular panels projecting off the drive unit at the rear
of the craft.

Well, they showed the resulting sketches to another group of engineers,
all of whom immediately said "It doesn\'t need fins, it operates in a
vacuum."  Of course, as soon as the heat-exchanger explanation was
provided, they immediately retracted their comments...but Kubrick
(rightly) worried that he\'d be accused of "inaccuracy" for putting fins on
his ship.  So, the fins were removed.  This is one of the most charmingly
ironic stories I know.

The problem here is that as soon as you introduce new physics, huge
numbers of unexpected possibilities open up, most of which you won\'t think
of right away.  Example:  T-plates and the near-c-lifeboat planet-wrecker
scenario.  Just for starters, I think that, given an infinite
extradimensional heat sink, I could design a perpetual motion machine that
would run off the cosmic microwave background and generate excess energy
besides.  This might have certain adverse effects on the Traveller
background. :) 

By the way, Asimov\'s "The Gods Themselves" covers a closely related
idea...it\'s a bit clunky as a novel, but includes some cool ideas.

Wait...are you saying Traveller isn\'t Real Life?  Heresy!  *Burn* the
heretic! :)

please include these additional numbers?  While I don\'t think not doing
this ought to be fatal, it\'ll certainly give the TML\'ers judging the
designs a good idea of the commercial viability of the vessel.

1) Financing costs: as per p.96 of the T4 manual, assume a 20% down
payment, with monthly payments of 1/240th of the cost of the ship for 480
months.  Put in amount of down payment and monthly payment.

2) Monthly crew salary (as per the crew salary table on p.113 of the T4
manual).  For those who don\'t have the T4 manual, pilots earn 6,000
cr/month, Navigators 5,000 cr/month, Engineers 4,000/month, Medics
2,000/month, and Gunners 1,000 cr/month.

3) Life support costs: 2,000 cr/month per occupied stateroom, 200 cr/month
per low berth (see p.97 T4 manual).

4) Annual maintenance costs: 1/1000th of the total cost of the starship per
annum.  I\'d suggest dividing this by 12 to give a monthly figure

5) Maximum revenues: at 4,000 cr/ton, how much revenue will it generate per
trip at 100% capacity?  Likewise, factor in passengers if carried (10,000
cr for a high passage, 8,000 for a medium, and 1,000 for a low passage)

6) Breakeven point: at 4,000 cr/ton, what how many tons of cargo must be
carried  in order to meet the total monthly expenses (monthly payment plus
monthly salaries plus 1/12th of annual maintenance).

        See my previous post...  And as noted below, we\'ll be getting an
aggretate of people\'s opinions of the ship\'s economic soundness in the
voting, which ought to impact the more extreme designs.  I\'d suggest just
including the costs & revenue data I recommend in my previous post and
going with that.

        And hey, if it doesn\'t pan out, recall that this is a beta-THUDDD,
so to speak :).  Wrinkles we encounter in this one can be ironed out and
not repeated in the next one...

        Well, whatever the TML\'ers rating your designs on economic
soundness think they can pay.  That\'s the beauty of doing this by vote; we
get a sort of "market" value for this sort of thing...

        No interpolation of non-standard QSDS parts; from what I gather,
that\'s contra to that system\'s modularity.  Using multiple small parts
(like power plants) to get closer to what you need isn\'t verboten
(wildstar, correct me if I\'m wrong on this).

I don\'t know, this one gave me a great deal of welcome amusement.  I could
never decide which was the intent:

    "Unless you obtain written consent from me, you are *obligated* to
     publish this message."
or
    "You may publish this message if and only if you do not obtain my
     written permission to do so."

Either way, it\'s kind of cool, in a Hoftstadterian way.  Especially the
latter, of course.

and its civilian derivative the TK-92 Port Usdiki, TK has also diversified
in recent years into small craft and a growing R&D arm working on advanced
starship systems and concepts.

TK Chairman Ian Karst has been vocal in urging better cooperation among
shipyards to lower costs via standardized designs and systems and will
be attending the forthcoming ISBA meetings.  Executive Vice President
and Chief Naval Architect Christaphos Lompoc has in the past echoed
those statements but was unavailable for comment at the time of this
press conference due to ongoing test operations of prototype spacecraft.

During the announcement, Karst stated that he hoped ISBA would form
several committees to work on specific areas of systems standardization,
spacecraft safety, and commercial designs.

Sir Arameth Gridlore, President and CEO of Gridlore Technolgies, today
announced GT\'s intention to join the ISBA.  Speaking from his personal ship,
the *Estimated Profit*, Sir Arameth offered praise for the founders of the
new association.

"The ISBA challenges us with new levels of both cooperation and competiton,
as we move forward into the new Imperial Era.  We at GT remain focused on
personal items, but we see a great potential for our new starship branch."

This brief announcement was followed by the unveiling of the imprint of the
new organization.  To be called Trans-C, the recently formed company will
act only as naval architects, and will control no ship building facilities.

When questioned by a reporter about his recent remarks concering the killing
of Marines with rocks, Sir arameth abrubtly cut the connection, ending the
interview.  The *Estimated Profit* left orbit shortly thereafter, and jumped
to an undisclosed location.

Note: At the TL that Traveller works at, it\'s not unreasonable
that they could get rid of the excess heat by actively transmitting
the energy at selected wavelenths  (say against the background
black body radiation) and perhaps even only at selected
directions.

Cost for staterooms are 2,000cr/ (two weeks) see p.97 T4 manual not
2,000/month.

4,000 cr/ton is the cost to purchased cargo not to ship it.  The 4,000/ton
shipping is incorrect on page 97, the chart on page 113 shows 1,000cr/ton
revenue for shipping and is in line with previous editions of Traveller.
(another example of typos)

If the Far Trader is armed do we calculate income including carrying 5tons
of mail for 25,000cr?

What % of stateroom occupancy?

Ahh thank you Joe for pointing that out. 

My disclaimer is sig. If you wish a signature less list put it to a vote.
That is what is going to decided about the headers [TML].

The reason I have such a sig disclaimer is because IG
borrowed/stole/violated a article that was posted to the Internet and
published it in JTAS. They did not have the article author\'s consent prior
to publishing it. He found out by reading his copy of JTAS. Gee what a
surprise!!! From what I understand they were able to work it out afterward
but I have not heard anymore on it. The JTAS seemed to say that if was on
the Internet it was ok to publish without paying for it or getting the
author\'s permission. IMOH they were very wrong!!! I do not care for that to
happen to anything I post to the Internet so the disclaimer.

I vote for a list with signatures.

If anything just to keep the digests all junked up. <G> ;-)

You know, it seems to me that this was brought on by the phone companies
inability to see the possible future of the internet (and mostly WWW)
exploding
into existence within a few short years.  Back in the early eighties the
phone 
company (AT&T) was touting ISDN as the future of the telephone network.  
The problem is that it was never introduced as a widely available system. 
This 
was probably due in part to the breakup of AT&T along with the fact that
ISDN
is more complex, requires more parts on the subscriber side, and was very
much more expensive.

The phone companies now want to stick the cost of access to the customer
because they couldn\'t conceive of anybody needing any more bandwidth 
than they already had (and these were the same people that wanted to use
video phones, sheesh).

I have to agree with them on one issue however.  There are too many people
connecting to the internet on non-dedicated dialup lines and staying on for

I dunno...it might be awfully difficult to mesh such disparate
(word for the day) TLs; kinda like trying to get a vacuum
tube-based television set to be hooked up to a modern, high-end
personal computer as a monitor. One, maybe two, levels\' difference
between TLs may be feasible but more than that would, IMO, require
a tremendous amount of work (and corresponding costs) at a
shipyard to make it all work together. Assuming, that is, the
shipyard manager can be convinced to give it a try.

    It\'s got to be a LOT of energy that\'s being soaked up.  Remember to that at
the level of technological competence we\'re talking about fusion reactors
producing enough energy to supply cities of millions with a cup of water.  At
least that\'s the current promise of fusion.  And that\'s a LOT of energy.

    Efficiency, I\'d never thought of that!  That would make a lot of sense,
especially when you\'re talking about fusing TONS hydrogen in minutes!  I mean
think about all those clips of nuclear bombs going off.  You get that kind of
power production with a few ATOMS!!!  Now you\'re going to fuse TONS!!!
    But efficiency would have an impact, if FoEx say half of it is being used
to cool the reactor as a heat sink perhaps?  Could one of the physics folks
figure out the energy production we\'re talking about here?  Your typical
Scout/Courier is fusing 10 tons of hydrogen in twenty minutes or so for the
jump.  How much energy is that?  To fuse ten tons of hydrogen?

At very high TLs, semi-controllable tractor fields are a fact in MT
and TNE. However, at the TL of introduction, they aren\'t all that
useful because of a very limited range. This TL, BTW, is around
16-17. Definitely *not* an issue in M0.

(Sylea) - \'tiihkeer\'reexkaap Industries today announced its formal 
application for associate membership in the Sylean Ship Builders 
Association (SSBA*). If granted, this would be the first time a major race 
starship manufacturer has joined the fledgling SSBA.

	Rookr!\'ng!\'koop, the K\'kree Trade Liaison from the Two Thousand World\'s 
embassy, stated that  \'tiihkeer\'reexkaap Industries felt that by joining 
the SSBA it could help to guide human shipbuilding practices and 
philosophies to the superior K\'kree models, and to help to create a demand 
for K\'kree goods and workmanship.

	\'tiihkeer\'reexkaap Industries also shocked the small Sylean shipbuilding 
community by declaring that starting in the year 0002 it would begin 
importing, in co-operation with Rr!!krmiixt Interface Lines, and the 
Embassy of the Two Thousand Worlds on Sylea, surplus K\'kree shuttles, 
modified for human interstellar use. Altough this is in planning stages 
right now, the first design to be imported in expected to fit in the human 
"far trader" classification.

	Rookr!\'ng!\'koop stated "We expect that these vessels, although far too 
small and technically inferior for the K\'kree market, will be greatly in 
demand for their superior workmanship. These vessels will be far superior 
to anything presently available in the Sylean marketplace, and this will be 
reflected in the price.".

	Negoatiations with the Sylean Trade Bureau continue to allow 
\'tiihkeer\'reexkaap Industries products access to the Sylean market with a 
fair and equitable tariff rate. These negotiations are optimistically 
expected to conclude by the end of the year.

* NOTE - the Two Thousand Worlds does not recognize the fledgling Sylean 
Federation\'s claim to be the successor to the Vilani Empire / Rule of Man. 
The Steppelord of the Two Thousand Worlds feels that Cleon\'s declaration of 
Empire to be far too rash, and will only recognize it when it is proven in 
the fullness of time.

Nope. My wife and I watched the opening of the series with great
anticipation and gave up in disgust within 20 minutes. We both agree
with your assessments above. Although I also have tuned in occasionally
in the hopes of improvement, I\'m still disappointed. Great special

I also have a request. I went through a few times to try and translate some 
of the old K\'kree designs from Alien Module 2 into SSDS designs. I was 
quickly stumper by the fact that most of them took 6000 dtn hulls. I dug 
out FF&S, but gave up in disgust after an hour (funny, thats how ALL my 
attempts at using FF&S seem to end). So, could anyone create a 6000 dtn 
SSDS flattened sphere hull for me, and either e-mail it to me at 
umkomosk@cc.umanitoba.ca, or post it to the list?

Yeah, I know QSDS/SSDS only go up to 5000 tons, but I figure it can stretch 
to 6000 without too much trouble.

     VJL Announces Starship Division

(Hazan, CORE) In a press conference today Darius Sadri, 
President of United Freight and Passenger Workers Union,
announced that the board of the UFPWU have drawn up plans to create
a new starship construction firm, Pan-Imperia Shipyards. 

"This extraordinary meeting of the board was called in response to the
recent anti-free trade maneuvering of the major ship builders." Sadri said.
"In particular, recent remarks by representatives of Famille Spofulam that
the ISBA has been founded \' to present a common front against the
organized labour movement [and] developing more *optimal* common
pricing agreements\' clearly are evidence of collusion, price-fixing, anti-
worker conspiracy, and the attempt at making the Free Trade and 
Travel that we have known as journeyman spacefarers a thing of the 
past. We will be placing the decision of the board before the entire 
membership of the UFPWU for a vote in the coming weeks and feel
certain that Pan-Imperia will become a certainty with every ship load of
returns from the sector branches that arrive. Pan-Imperia will strive to
uphold the ideals of VJL to provide economical service and quality to
the citizens of the new Imperium as the only fully-employee owned 
shipyard in current existence.

"Only by cutting out the middle man can
space travel be truly economical and worthwhile for the average 
citizen. I urge the Imperial Ministry of Economic Benevolence to begin
investigations into the intentions and practices of the ISBA; can any sentient
being truly be expected to believe that the founding of the ISBA the very
same week that jump drive prices shot up an incredible 1400% be sheer
coincidence!?"

Current plans indicate Pan-Imperia is scouting out older yards and facilities
to buy out with membership funds as the core of its manufacturing and
design hub. It is expected that the majority of the membership of UFPWU
will agree to the prospectus. If so, 95% of the initial owner-operators will be
Pilots and affiliated staff of ValuJump Lines (VJL). ValuJump has gained 
a recent level of notoriety with their popular practice of no-frills space 
travel, epitomized by a recent ad slogan "So Economical, You\'ll Think 
You\'re Part of the Crew!"(tm) 

Members of the ISBA could not be reached at press time.

of interest, but here you all go anyhow.

Secondly, I figure that with one week in jump and one week turnaround time
(land, unload passengers and cargo, load cargo and passengers, depart) you
can do two trips/month.  Let\'s use these as the official THUDDD figures.

Third, in the financial information, I\'ve put in the total monthly cost of
running the vessel at full occupancy.  Obviously, if staterooms and low
berths are going unoccupied, the crew can cut off life support in order to
lower costs.  However, I chose not to take this into account in calculating
the breakeven point, just to keep it simple.

Finally, I have no bloody idea how whoever did the ship designs for the T4
manual got a result of 31 Mcr for the cost of the Far Trader; the cost of a
J-2 drive in SSDS costs more than that all by itself.

Press Release, Sylea Year 0 Day 41

Famille Spofulam Yards is pleased to announce the release of its Coureur
Des Bois-1 class Far Trader.  It scores a number of firsts for FSY: first
ship to accellerate at under 3G, first ship to cost under 170 MCR, and
first mass market general-purpose trading vessel.

        The CDB-1 is designed with an eye to the bottom line; while still
offering the purchaser the famed Famille Spofulam quality and attention to
detail, it nevertheless is relatively inexpensive and is capable of turning
profits of up to 407.6 Kcr a month.  Powered by a 75 Mw Zhunastu Fusion
Systems power plant, with Famille Spofulam Subsystems Thruster plate and
Jump drives, it is capable of Jump-2 performance and 1 G accelleration.  At
current rates, its 76 displacement ton cargo hold, six large passenger
staterooms for High or Medium passengers and six low berths practically
guarantee profitable operation along the Imperial mains.  In case its
owners wish it to venture further afield, it is also armoured, and capable
of self-defense with a 95 mj Ling Standard civilian laser mounted in a
small turret.

 The CDB-1 is built into a sleek 200 TD streamlined superdense disk hull, 4
meters high by 29.85 meters in diameter.  and features a single-deck
vertically-oriented layout.  While this would normally preclude the need
for inertial compensators, the direction of thrust being vertical relative
to the decks (a result of FSY\'s "inherent safety" design philosophy), a 3G
inertial compensation system is built in, thereby offering the ultimate in
travelling comfort; even in lateral, edge-on flight during atmospheric
operations the CDB-1\'s ride is ultra-smooth.  Obviously, during
exo-atmospheric operations or  vertical landings the CDB-1 travels top
first, rather like a thrown pie.

        The CBD-1 is laid out as follows: right forward  (at twelve
o\'clock) is a small but well-laid out bridge for the pilot and navigator,
featuring twin recumbent ergonomic acceleration couches in its two
workstations.  Immediately to clockwise, viewed from above, lies an 84
cubic meter lounge and dining area, with floor-to-ceiling panoramic ports.
The crew cabins (four small staterooms), are placed along the rim of the
hull down a curving corridor leading aft.  The six low berths are located
in a compartment at the end of this corridor.

        A corridor running counterclockwise, beginning at the lounge,
passes aft of the bridge.  Engineering is located aft of the bridge across
this corridor; power plant, gravitic generators for the thruster plates,
and the jump drive reactor are located here, along with an engineer\'s
workstation and access to the turret and cargo hold.  Further down the
corridor to counterclockwise lie the six large passenger staterooms,
likewise placed along the rim of the hull to allow the best possible view
through floor-to-ceiling panoramic ports.

        The 76 displacement ton cargo hold is located immediately aft of
the engineering compartment, with cargo doors opening right aft at the 6
o\'clock position.  Fuel tankage occupies the rest of the interior volume of
the vessel.  Finally, the thruster plates and the laser turret are located
on the underside of the hull.  The placement of the laser turret was
dictated by the non-combatant nature of the CDB-1; it is expected to be
avoiding combat, not charging into it, and this requires the ability to
fire upon targets while accellerating away from them.  This concept was
first developed for the FSY Moufette-Rapide Far Courier.

        FSY expects that the CDB-1 will serve to meet the growing demand
for trading vessels in the young Imperium, and believes that they will come
to be ubiquitous wherever Imperial merchants venture in search of profits.

     Pan-Imperia a Reality

(Hazan, CORE) Darius Sadri, president of the UFPWU announced in a 
press release today the foundation of Pan-Imperia Shipyards and Services.
"The initial votes have arrived via fast courier" Sadri was quoted, "and 
the near-unanimity of the results have surprised even me. With the
consent of the membership assured, we may now finalize negotiations
to purchase several idle shipyards for refurbishment and activation. I have
no doubts that this will take a minimum amount of time with the enthusiastic
efforts of the membership supplying a truly staggering variety of skills to
the task. It just goes to show you what a Feudal Technocracy can accom-
plish when the people so will it!"

Pan-Imperia Shipyards and Services becomes the first subsidiary of 
ValuJump Lines, an economy passenger and freight service headquartered
at PaNaJay City, Hazan, CORE. VJL\'s stock went up 7 points to Cr 27 a 
share on the CSE upon word of the press release.

I agree that the first two seasons were slow starting, but if you\'d seen 
any of season 3, you\'d *know* that the characters are *not* two 
dimensional. Many are in the process of going through *major* changes in 
season 3. Though I found B5 interesting in seasons 1 & 2, Season 3 
absolutely *hooked* me -- The story arc really took off. IMHO, B5 is the 
epitome of Sci-fi drama on the small screen. What a drag my local station 
dropped it >:-<

Oy, YES! The 2nd & 3rd seasons improved *phenomonanally*. In fact, the 
producer and writer of the series, J. Michael Strazinski (SP?) set a 
record for writing in a television series: though there were several 
writers for the first two seasons, JMS wrote *all* the episodes in season 
3. The third season was pivotal in his story arc, IIRC, no other writer 
has *ever* written all the episodes for one year of *any* television 
series.

BTW, I have been impressed with the recent episodes of DS9. They\'ve been 
pretty good, and much improved from the early episodes, it\'s becoming my 
favorite Trek incarnation (can\'t touch B5 with a 10 meter bat\'leth, 
tho\'). Voyager has been, well,  how can I put it delicately? It sortof 
like takes the worst of the "cheeze" factor from the Original Series and 
mixes it with the worst of the "wuss" factor of the Next Generation. But 
it has its moments.

	Ok all you travller Gurus out there here is a idea I been toying with.
Due to the fact that Jump fuel takes up 10% displacement per ship per jump,
alot of space is used up(ok I know its stating the obvious but wait) on all
ships.
So what if you kept the Lhyd under pressure?it lowers the space and still
lets you keep the same amount. This may not be a good idea for war ships but
all of those Free,Far,Fat traders out there can make a lot more in the
process of a days opps weeks work. I dont pretend to know alot about this
type of thing but I\'m sure some on here does. If this is a workable idea what
whoud the compression rates be?

I had originally hoped to avoid doing another revision of QSDS 1.x, in favor

least another week before any sort of playtest edition of QSDS 2.0 is ready.
Given that many people want to use QSDS for the THUDDD competition, I
thought a new version might be appreciated.

Currently QSDS 1.5 is available in Microsoft Word 95 (this is the "native"

Strange.  I too tuned in to B5 the first show (pilot), and I couldn\'t 
get through it.  Then I saw a few more from first season, and I just 
didn\'t like it.

Then I tuned in again and caught the first episode of season two--and 
I liked it.  So, I watched a few more episodes, and before long, I 
was hooked.

The show is just incredible.  Things planted in one season are 
explained two seasons later.  Character development is just 
incredible too.  Take the Narns.  When we first saw them they were 
your typical Klingon-like bad guys.  Then the Centauri decimated 
their homeworld with mass drivers (how\'s that for a Traveller 
connection?) and turned it into slag...and the Narns have come from 
your two dimensional baddies to very noble and credible allies with a 
deep religion and brave hearts.

Give bab a shot.  Give it a few shows.  You\'ll probably get hooked.  
But, you\'d better hurry.  B5 is a totally concieved show--from start 
to finish.  It will only run for 5 seasons, and we are in the fourth 
right now.  There is talk of another B5 series, one featuring the 
rangers, but that will take place during the time before and 
concurrent with the series.

TNT is also in negotiations to make two made for cable movies about 
B5.  

I remember when I told my gaming group about B5.  Their anwers were, 
"I can\'t get past the guy with the hair sticking straight up."

Well, when I first started watching the show, I thought he was dumb 
looking too.  But as you get to know the characters, and the Centauri 
as a race, it makes perfect sense for their hair to stand up like 
napoleonic peacocks.

Trust me.  B5 is something to get excited about.

Kenneth.

Guy, is it deliberate that the cost of jump drives are now MCr4.2 per ton
instead of just 4? If it\'s deliberate, why this minor change? Does it
really add anything to the rules and/or background? Do I really have to
go over the ten designs I went over last night and correct all my figures
once more? Are you having fun? Are you trying to drive me nuts? Why are you
doing this to me? AAAAARRRRRGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!!

[There will be a short musical interlude while I have a little breakdown.]

Tell me you just forgot that dividing 4 by 14 and rounding off to 0.3 and 
then multiplying by 14 is a BAD idea... No bisquit for you, my boy.

For independent traders bumming around, we should propably stick to the 25
trips per year that the rules imply. That would give them rougly 5 days on
each planet to find passengers, freight, and cargo. For sceduled traders,
freighters, and liners we can assume that there is a steady supply so that
they can start loading almost as soon as they have discharged what they
brought. I suggest 35 jumps/year if they travel surface-to-surface and
40/year if they travel jump limit-to-jump limit.

In my campaign the mass detectors/grav scanners work somewhat like this:
The sensor is actually a VERY weak tractor beam. The pull it generates is
proportional to it\'s power consumtion and inversely proportional to the
square of the range. By measuring the power consumtion (voltage drop
actually) a measurement can be made of the mass inside its field. On higher
TLs (16-17) they are developed into useful tractors. One problem with these
sensors is that they have to be mounted on the surface like AEMS and PEMS
despite gravitons ability to travel through matter. Any material between
the sensors "eye" will generate a powerconsumtion that is enormous which
will drown the far away masses in noise, remember that power/pull drops of
by range.

I like this kind of handwaving rules because it adds a bit of chrome and it
postulates that any scientific advances are made in the ver y small first
before getting applied to large scale. The same should probably be said
about jump. At TL 8 they probably know a thing or two about jumpspace and
jumpfield but most scientists except lunatic fringe UFO-geeks and mad
scientists think it only applies to subatomic particles and has no use.

Liquid hydrogen is VERY hard to compress so I\'d say that can be ruled out.
Another option that I\'ve written about on the list a couple of times is you
can store MORE hydrogen in solid matter than in tanks! You can pretty
easily put 10x the amount of hydrogen inside solid titanium. This packing
is a quantum mechanical effect that is also behind the leaking of hydrogen
through solid walls. X-boats and others where jumprange is at premium could
have solid titanim or palladium tanks to store 10x as much hydrogen. This
would seriously break canon though so some handwaving is needed I think.
Perhaps the hydrigen needs to be extracted extremely fast?

In fact, when Fleischman & Pons made a back-of-the-envelope calculation
about how much pressure was needed to compress hydrogen to the same
densities that you get for free inside metals and found that these
pressures were in the hot fusion ballpark they started the investigations
that led to their semi-successful cold fusion research.

Try not to wince at things like the episode where they take off from
earth in their single seater "fighters" to rendezvous with the carrier
somewhere near Jupiter (figure out the kind of velocities they have to
hit to do this!). Then they hide in the Tojan Asteroids (from which
they can see jupter!?). And then they attack enemy fighters that are
moving towards earth (when the relative velocities should be 100s of
km/sec). And the fights are in *visual* range at velocities such that
they can make multiple firing passes? 

Sorry, but that one episode made me give up on *that* show.

I\'m surprised that it\'s that *low*.

You *have* to extract excess humidity from the ship\'s air. So that\'s
one source of water. All water in the "sewage" system can also be
recovered, simply by using waste heat from the powerplant to boil it
dry. Then you condense the vapor. I\'d do the condensing with the
"preheat" system for warming the LH2 to gas before feeding it into the
reactor. That\'ll condense a *lot* of water.

The dried sewage (baked actually) will store in less space than a
"honey tank" and will be easier to dispose of. It\'d make good
fertilizer as the heat will have sterilized it. So it can likely be
*sold* at some stops. At the rest, it should be essentially "free"
(cost of hauling it from the ship matched by what the hauler can sell
it for).

So I\'d expect more like 99% recovery of water.

In fact, because metabolism turns food into water and CO2, you\'ll end
up a trip with *more* water than you started with.

Sorry, but those sorts of fins are used to maximize *conductive* and
*convective* cooling. Neither of which works in space. 

For *radiative* cooling, "parallel" surfaces *minimize* the cooling!
What you want is the maximum area exposed to *space* without being
exposed to any other radiators, parts of the ship, or heat sources
(like nearby stars).

No. It just requires a temp differential. And since the portions of the
sky that aren\'t stars or planets are at 3K, you have a fair sized
differential. 

The real problem is that the temp of the radiator determines the rate
at which heat is radiated. Higher temps radiate faster. But *getting*
those higher temps requires "pumping" heat. Which requires more power,
which generates more waste heat, which...

Sorry, but laser light is *low* entropy. Therefore (David Brin in
"Sundiver" notwithstanding) it *cannot* be used to get rid of heat
(high entropy).

David Brin used it in Sundiver, and it *won\'t* work. It\'s a perpetual
motion machine type gimmick.

Waste heat is heat that *cannot* be used to perform "work". And that
includes "pumping" lasers.

And using "heat pumps" to "concentrate" waste heat (giving you higher
radiator temps) produces more heat than it gets rid of. 

There are problems with surface area, and they go all the way back to
the beginning of Traveller.

Well, you have to see the first season as setting the stage, getting 
aquainted to all the characters, getting the first glimpse of the 
backplot and the political situation, as well as the "historical" 
background! 
Then, when the stage was set, real adventure could begin, all the 
points not understood earlier now transformed or brought up in a 
different light (Best example: The episode in the first season, where 
Bab4 reappears, followed by the 3rd eason episodes which detail why 
it happened and how!).
This setup is a logical process for the storyline, too.
While in the fist and partly the second season, the dark forces were 
gathering forces and trying to remain hidden, the main characters had 
to slowly put the pieces together and find out what happened.
Then the wars began, and now in Season three (I haven\'t seen season 4 
yet! Don\'t anybody DARE spoiling me!), we are in the middle of some 
serious action. 
That is what i like about the series: It\'s logical, thought through, 
consistent with itself and trhe characters behave like we expect them 
to, because we know them and only one author is steering them (Not 
like Janeway, who behaves differently to danger to the ship in every 
other episode!). That makes charakter development much more 
realistic!

Just remember, though, that JTAS #25 was put together entirely under the 
old management.  If any such abuses occurred, they are in the past.  IG 
isn\'t interested in stealing information posted to the internet.  It\'s 
quite simple to ask the author for permission to use it; most of us are 
happy to contribute to Traveller, after all.  The $25/page for JTAS 
articles is just icing on the cake.

And just to provide a counter-example, a few articles that appeared on 
this list made their way into the M0 manuscript; in every case where I 
included one, I asked the author\'s permission first.  Not once was I 
turned down - people here are generally quite generous with their work.

From what I remember ST:TNG started off slowly in the first two seasons
and picked up after that.
B5 does the same, about half way through season two. My advice, keep
watching, watch for the story arc, you won\'t be dissapointed.
I personally like B5 because it has a more traveller feel to it than ST.
I *love* the star-furies, and really enjoy the space combat scenes.

The main reason for using MCr 4.2/ton (instead of 4.0) is because both FF&S
and Dave Golden\'s SSDS use MCr 4.2/ton - and QSDS v1.x is supposed to match
those.

It shouldn\'t take _that_ much time to subtract 5% from the jump drive prices
of 10 ships.  If you\'d multiplied the prices by 14 like I said in my message
admitting the error, instead of re-figuring things at MCr 4.0 per ton, you\'d
be fine now.

_I_ didn\'t forget ... but maybe Joe Fugate and/or GDW did?  The figure FF&S
uses is 0.3MCr per cubic meter (and not 0.2857), and I think MegaTraveller
used this same number (but I\'m not positive).  If so, Jump Drives haven\'t
been 4.0 MCr/ton since High Guard (there must\'ve been a price hike during
the Rebellion).

        In my previously posted examply I put them at the base of the
scale, i.e. all at skill level 1.  Seems to me that this reflects the fact
that in many cases owners will be serving as crew, thereby dragging down
costs quite dramatically.  One could even have a syndicate of co-owners
working on board the ship, making their money off dividends rather than
salaries, which would draw it down even further.  But I figured having at
lease a base salary cost in there seemed to be a good thing..

ImperialNews Service wire 0001:42

	YugoShips PLC Says NO to ISBA

	Vladimir Ivankov, Chairman of the upstart shipbuilding firm
YugoShips PLC annouced today that his company will _not_ join the nacent
Imperial Ship Builders Association. 

	"This is blatant attempt to crowd the smaller firms out of the
business. In my experience these Business \'Associations\' always seem to
ask higher and higher membership fees, they collude to rig bids, and are
generally a gangsterish impediment to true free trade.

	"As an example, hot on the heels of this announcement; comes an
across-the-board, Imperium wide increase in the price of Jump Drives, the
lifeblood technology of interstellar trade. Why Drive prices have gone up
 to 14 TIMES their old price!" 

	The volatile shipbuilder thundered these remarks at a recent
business banquet in NovoGrodsky Down, the site of planetside operations of
YugoShips.

	"Mark my words...if this, this gang gets to control shipbuilding,
only the corrupt wealthy will be able own ships!"

	"That they have include Cleon Industries, a non-shipbuilding
company in their scheme, clearly shows the heights this gangster cartel
reaches in the Imperium!"

	In other comments Invankov hinted darkly at other, less than legal
actions by ISBA members. While he wouldn\'t go on record with his
suspicions, he mentioned one firm who "...specializes in high speed,
dangerous ships and vehicles, who\'s only use is by hoologans and
criminals..." as supplying pirates with ships for "...suitcases full of
credits and false names...".

	While no other official with the company would go on record, the
public affairs officer, Jeanne Vasgel stated tersely in a hastily arranged
press conference that "Mr. Ivankov IS the majority stockholder with the
company, and he is well known for his often contrarian views, however the
officers and shareholders of YugoShips put up with...uhhh... fully support
him. No further comment is available at this time." 
 
	YugoShips PLC stock closed slightly down amidst heavy trading on
the NovoGrodsky stock exchange. Most analysts are waiting for tomorrows
results, since the news hit near the close of trading today.

	YugoShips PLC is the manufacturer of a line of inexpensive modular
starships of 200 tons displacement. Widely derided in some quarters for
having little or no armor and armament, Mr. Ivankov in the past has stated
that they are intended for "...free trade, not free piracy...why else are
we paying such taxes to the Imperial Navy...to pay for their button
polish?"

        Nix on the FF&S.  From what I gather it would present too much of
advantage to those who have access to it, wherease SSDS & QSDS are
available to all with net access... and this follows Wildstar\'s precedent
with last month\'s non-unofficial and non-highly democratic <grin> ship
design contest.

        As for TL, I was under the impression that that was the TL
available to work with for everything: I don\'t recall seeing anything in
the rules to the effect that civilian stuff has to be 1 TL less than the
actual TL. I\'d suggest letting it stand; it\'s been out for two days now and
some people have already designed some ships.  Recall that we\'re at the
alpha-test stage here; this just shows that I was overly optimistic in
thinking that we could do without discussion on design requirements.  I
think that Paul will be taking careful note of this for the next one, right
Paul?

        And if people think that a 1-TL difference is going to totally
invalidate said ships in their Milieu 0 campaign world, they could just
rate them really low... thank god for democracy :).

checks that have been inflicted on me :).  Please use these numbers if
you\'re going to be doing a financial info section on your THUDDD
submission.  Apologies to anybody I\'ve misled with my previous
error-riddled posts, and if anybody sees any errata in these, please let
the list know.


1) Financing costs: as per p.96 of the T4 manual, assume a 20% down
payment, with monthly payments of 1/240th of the cost of the ship for 480
months.  Put in amount of down payment and monthly payment.

2) Monthly crew salaries (as per the crew salary table on p.113 of the T4
manual).  For those who don\'t have the T4 manual, pilots earn 6,000
cr/month, Navigators 5,000 cr/month, Engineers 4,000/month, Medics
2,000/month, and Gunners 1,000 cr/month.  Use the Skill-1 numbers to
reflect possibility of owner-operator(s) lowering costs... it\'s a
compromise.

3) Monthly life support costs: 2,000 cr/2-week trip per occupied stateroom,
200 cr/2-week trip per low berth (see p.97 T4 manual).  Double these to
give monthly cost of full occupancy.

4) Annual maintenance costs: 1/1000th of the total cost of the starship per
annum.  Divide this by 12 to give a monthly figure.

5) Total monthly costs: Add up all of the monthly costs above.  This is
what you\'ve got to earn in order to break even.

5) Maximum monthly revenues: at 1,000 cr/ton of cargo, how much revenue
will it generate per trip at 100% capacity?  Likewise, factor in passengers
if carried (10,000 cr for a high passage, 8,000 for a medium, and 1,000 for
a low passage), and mail (5,000 cr/ton up to 5 tons if the ship is armed).
Calculate the total maximium revenue assuming full passenger occupancy and
5 tons of mail (don\'t forget to subtract 5 tons worth of cargo to make room
in the hold for the mail).

6) Breakeven point: at 1,000 cr/ton, how many tons of cargo/how many
passengers  must be carried in order to meet the total monthly costs.


        As I\'ve pointed out in a previous post, the two trips/month is
actually pretty slow; with good brokers (methinks that being buddy-buddy
with your brokers is *essential*), and spending only 4-5 days on turnaround
between trips, it\'d be possible to squeeze an extra trip in every two
months or so.  Given that Milieu 0 is not a perfect world I figure that
it\'s best to be conservative and stick to a week spent between trips.

        Other assumptions I\'ve made here include base crew salaries and
maxed-out life support costs.  While these are debatable, I think they\'ll
do as a benchmark...

the financial infor for your designs.

2) Given those changes, I thought it best to run the numbers on the CDB-1
again.  Clearly the passengers are the difference between life and death
now (and mail doesn\'t hurt), but on a very good run, even a non-speculative
operator will still be able to pull down at most 134 Mcr a month; 40%
margins are not bad, methinks.  Given that this is assuming a two-sided
route, with one week spent in jump and a full week spent on the ground
between jumps (which is apparently on the high side), a driven crew with a
good broker could squeeze in a few more trips per year and make even more.
I think that\' it\'s still viable...   And there\'s always speculative trade
on the side.

Annual maintenance costs: 69.6 Kcr per annum, 5.8 Kcr per month
Total monthly costs: 332.4 Kcr
Maximum monthly revenues: 466 Kcr (at 142 Kcr from cargo (total cargo
capacity less 5 tons for mail times 1,000 cr/ton), 25 Kcr from mail, 60 Kcr
from 6 High passengers, 6 Kcr from 6 Low passengers, for 233 Kcr a trip at
full capacity times 2 trips per month).
Breakeven point: 2 trips per month, with cargo hold full (of cargo), no
mail, with 1.5 High
passengers per trip and the ship will make a negligible profit.

        So it isn\'t quite the obscene moneymaker it\'d be at 4,000 cr per
ton... at least you can still make an honest living from it :).

Yeah, I didn\'t intend for it go 700kph in a city.  I figured people
would take it to max speed somewhere in the country side where there is
plenty of flat open ground. Sort of like driving across Kansas.

Uproar has broken out in the heart of the traditional and established 
element of the starship construction industry today with the shock 
announcement of the formation of a new player on the ship-building 
scene.

A press release from the \'Beyer-Suristen Syndic\' today announced the 
formation of a new starship construction company based upon a 
secretive surprise buyout of the four hundred year old Holva 
Industries shipyards, a deal which has already attracted a great deal 
of criticism from more established players in the industry, not least 
because of the alleged histories of the two main partners in the new 
concern, \'speculative traders\' Venn Beyer and Eckil Suristen.

Announcing their retirement from what they choose to term their 
\'speculative marketing and needs satisfaction era\', Beyer and 
Suristen have bought the Holva Shipyards lock, stock and blast pit, 
and in a move that has infuriated many, recruited some of the best 
ship designers and construction workers around with large pay deals 
and unspecified bonuses which the new company refer to as 
\'confidential industrial incentives of a fiscal, narcotic or 
otherwise pleasurable nature\'.

Hrollum  Shushkkam of the Master Shipbuilders Association commented 
earlier today from outside his rejuvenation therapy clinic:

\'It\'s a damn disgrace that a couple of cheap smugglers like these two 
can just force their way in on a traditional old family business like 
Holva.  We all know where this money\'s come from.  We all know that 
these two reprobates have no ship-building experience.  Think they 
can just buy their way in.  Well, let me tell you, I can\'t imagine 
buying a child\'s toy from them, let alone an interstellar craft.  
It\'s a damn disgrace if the ISBA is open to vagabonds and criminals 
like these. A damn disgrace.\'

When asked to comment on these allegations, Beyer and Suristen\'s 
\'press officer and media commando\' Arlen Draff stated that Shushkkan 
was an DELETED BY ORDERS LEGAL DEPARTMENT: REMOVE
THIS DISCLAIMER BEFORE PUBLICATION and that what was more he could 
take his interstellar craft and DELETED BY ORDERS LEGAL DEPARTMENT.

Draff outlined B&SS\' intention to provide \'quality at low cost\' to 
the discerning starship buyer, but refused to expand upon the 
organisation\'s publicity materials which referred to \'all the little 
extras that many interstellar businessmen need in today\'s competitive 
market.\'  According to Draff, B&SS\' first product would be the design 
of a small starship ideally suited to \'those small businessmen who 
need to move goods from A to B quickly and discreetly, perhaps 
stopping off at C for reasons which may be perfectly valid, and any 
trip they may make to D is their own business, quite frankly.\'

Draff added that he was aware of many slurs upon the reputation of 
his employers:

\'It should be made clear that no legal proceedings have ever been 
taken against either of these great entrepreneurs.  I\'m sorry, that 
should read "It should be made clear that no *successful* legal 
proceedings have ever been taken against either of these great 
entrepreneurs".  And now gentleman, if you have no more questions, we 
have a free bar through here, as we are whole-heartedly committed to 
good relations with the media.\'

Beyer and Suristen were themselves unavailable for comment.  Media 
rumour has it that Beyer has gone solo off-planet to cruise in the 
Oort Cloud where he \'does all his best thinking\' and that Suristen 
was too drunk to come to the vid-phone.

Updates shortly.

What about the task system of MMT4 do you not like?  I find the device by
which Marc managed to keep d6 while increasing the resolution of the
process interesting.  I\'m told that it is similar to GURPS, having been
blessed enough to avoid it, I wouldn\'t know.

	Target = Stat + Skill - Modifiers

	Roll xd6 where x = difficulty.

What\'s complicated or over simplified about that?  I\'ll admit that I\'m a
d20-lover, but I\'m willing to give it a shot...  It\'s convenient to only
need one type of die.  I also like the 1/2 dice.  Heh.

I like the new additions of the "pools" for combat, though a better name
could have been found for them.  I do question the validity of adding a
point to your END pool for EVERY combat task, though.  I don\'t find firing
a handgun, or even my shotguns, that tiring (and I seriously doubt that my
own END is much above a 5 or 6).  I need to think about it further, but
I\'ll probably only add points to the END pool for melee attacks, running,
etc.

I think that the initiative tools are still VERY weak; I plan to use [ 1/2
* (DEX) + Tactics ] to achieve a TNE-like initiative sequence, possibly
with INT deciding ties.  I don\'t think that initiative is all that random,
but for those who do, throw it in as a TASK!

I think IG missed the boat on character generation, though.  I\'m not
table-averse, but I prefer the more engaging system of the "House Rules". 
At the very least, they could have included TASK rolls for the survival et
al rolls (see, I\'m still on topic!).

You complained about the number one gripe was with the task system, and
then spent all of your time on the design sequence...  Why?  Just use the
stereotypical Traveller gear and like it!!!  Heh.

The old, old, version of the Book 2 starship combat rules treated sand in
an interesting way.  For those of you not familiar with them, the original
Traveller space combat rules used vector-based movement (no hexes!), had
planetary templates with fractional G gravitational bands which affected
your course, very simple rules to allow aerobraking, and some other neat
stuff.  (It originally used miles, but later Black Book editions junked 
that in favor of the metric system.)  The scale was set a bit cumbersome;
the playing surface required was too big (originally 1 inch to 1000 miles).  
Damaged ships (heck, *undamaged* ships) tend to careen off under the couch.
Templates for planets and moons were *huge*.  Let\'s just put it this way.
The jump point at 4.3 light-seconds from Terra would be at 800 inches,
which is sixty-six feet (or twenty meters)!  :)  It\'s a good thing that
combat turns were only ten minutes long, so ships wouldn\'t go so far.  
Changing official scale by a factor of ten was a Good Idea, unless you
had a football field to play on, and big tape measures.  

Sandcaster fire created clouds of sand on the playing surface, which had
a fixed vector.  Laser fire crossing through sand clouds had their chance
"to hit" reduced depending on how much thickness of sand they had to cut
through before reaching the target.  This had the neat side-effect that
sand clouds would drift around the playing surface and could be ducked
behind.  The problem with sand was that, at least in the original rules,
it wasn\'t clear how large a cloud a single sand cannister made.  Judging
by the defensive DM table, it looks like it might have been 1/4" in scale,
or 250 miles!  Somehow, this doesn\'t seem like it would work in reality....

Supposedly, these clouds of sand also interfered with missile fire and
caused minor damage to ships passing through them.  I don\'t recall seeing
any actual rules (at least in the original books) implementing this.

Off on a tangent, I recently looked to see how sensors and weapons worked
in the old rules.  Originally, sensors detected automatically out to a
range of 500,000 miles (2.7 light-seconds); military sensors detected to
two million miles (10.7 light-seconds).  I know for certain that this was
revised down in later Black Book editions.  Ships running silent were
undetectable over 100,000 miles (0.5 light-seconds); in orbit, over ten
thousand miles (0.05 light-seconds)  Lasers hit on two dice at 8+ out
to 150,000 miles (0.8 light-seconds), at 10+ out to 300,000 miles (1.6
light-seconds), and at 13+ beyond that, with modifiers depending on what
computer programs you both were running and the crews skill levels.  I 
assume the numbers all are different in the later "metric" space combat 
system.

read Supplement 7: Traders and Gunboats for CT (published in 1980 - I
bought my copy new that year, which just shows I\'ve been playing this

Marava Far Trader described in that volume.


Empress Marava
200T Far Trader

Dimensions: 49.3 x 28.5 x 8.7 meters
Crew: 3  (Pilot/Navigator, Engineer, and Steward/Medic)
	 (In addition, two gunners may be carried as needed)
Acceleration: 2G; normal operations and cruising at 1G
Jump: 2  (Fuel carried for one jump 2 or two jump 1)
Gravitics: Adjustable 0.1 to 2.0 G; inertial compensators
Range: 4 weeks manuever; three months life support
Cargo: Seven Passengers; Four Low Passengers; 46/61 Tons Cargo*
Armament: 2x Dual Laser Turret; optional weaponry available
Electronics: Model/1bis computer.  Entertainment consoles
Ship\'s Boats: None.  One four passenger air/raft carried over forward
              cargo loading ramp with interior boarding and access.
	      Used for errands and has limited sub-orbital capability.
Cost: MCr. 66.175 - this price does not include the weaponry.
TL: Not specified

*Both figures appear in the description; the second is the correct one.


Notes: The ship is streamlined and has scoops for gas giant refueling.
       It has a fuel purification system installed.  The four low berths
       can hold livestock to 400kg; the instalation is essentially the
same as the Emergency Low Berth in QSDS.  The laser turrets are standard,
though the description says a mixed package of missile, laser, and
sandcaster weaponry is becoming increasingly popular (in CT, one could put
up to three weapons in a turret, and mix different weapons in the same
turret - we always liked a triple turret with one laser, one sandcaster,
and one missile launcher).  According to thye description, the ship cannot
turn a profit in normal cargo and passenger operations, even with a full
load - cargo speculation is mandatory just to break even.


Conversion to T4:
  Most aspects of the design can be converted easily.  In QSDS terms, this
ship has 10 large (4 ton) staterooms, seven of which are capable of
passenger service.  On the plans, one of the crew staterooms is drawn
larger than the others; presumably this is for the crewmember who is the
owner.  Six of the passenger cabins are grouped together, with the seventh
(originally intended as a crew cabin) on the bridge level near the other
crew cabins.  When seven passengers are carried, four of the five crew (if
a full complement plus two gunners is carried) have to share cabins.

  The Far Trader appears in both MT and TNE; there are minor differences
due to changes in the design systems used, with TNE ships having a larger
crew (I think) with more small cabins.

  I\'ll be happy to answer any questions, so feel free to contact me.

Ce Acatl Corporation (Sylea/Core) is a diversified engineering services
firm which last year celebrated its centennial.  As was announced at that
time, CAC is committed to positioning itself as the design firm of choice
for reliable, high-quality transport systems throughout Sylean space.

Therefore, we are very pleased to announce that CAC has signed a merger
agreement with Tassini Yards on Sylea, a highly acclaimed shipyard
renowned for the quality of its work on a variety of civilian and military
vessels (including the highly popular "Tralik" class 400-ton freighter).
The company, now known as CAC/Tassini, will design and prototype starships
and small craft for the expanding Empire of which we are all so proud to
be a part. 

The first CAC/Tassini joint design is already in progress:  A 200-ton J2
merchant vessel (the "Far Trader" category) utilizing a Fusion+ powerplant
(All hail our gracious Emperor!) for superior performance.  The ship class
has been designated "Pochteca," after a caste of long-range traders on
prestellar Terra.  Several non-disclosure agreements and market
considerations prevent us from providing further details at this time. 

Emphasizing the CAC/Tassini commitment to quality and interoperability, we
are proud to announce our membership in the nascent Imperial Ship
Builders\' Association (ISBA).  CAC has long supported industry consortia
such as this as a means to ensure that useful standards of design and
construction are set and rigorously followed, without the need for direct
involvement of government regulators.

Finally, CAC/Tassini finds regrettable recent remarks by the chairman of
Famille Spofulam Yards concerning labor relations in the shipbuilding
industry.  While FSY is of course welcome to do business as they see fit,
we hope they will in turn recognize that CAC/Tassini and other members of
the ISBA have very good relations with the United Shipyard Workers and its
affiliated unions.  In addition, we categorically reject any suggestion of
industry-wide collusion or "price fixing" as abhorrent ethically and of
questionable legality.  While we look forward to working as peers with FSY
in developing the ISBA, we in no manner endorse nor abide by any of their
policies and business practices.

A major press release concerning the "Pochteca" project is expected to be
released in the very near future.  Once again, CAC/Tassini wishes to thank
our gracious Emperor, our customers, our employees, and the people of the
Empire for making CAC/Tassini the number one choice for ship construction.

Yeah, it is.  However, it is quite reasonable that it take
a _lot_ of energy to get into jump space.  Also, such energy
requirements can also represent one barrier to FTL travel
at lower technologies.

It would also be cute if a lot of that energy came back out
(since you are not dropping back down to a lower energy
state) in a big flash that anyone who could be bohtered
to look would see.  However, that might violate background.
(I think you get some sort of flash but not a big one
and it might mess up sensor ranges).

Well, since there isn\'t a huge amount of energy seen, the excess

CrystalIron Age, V. 21, N. 1 (reprinted by permission)


Editor\'s Introduction:

  When we first heard about the rumblings in the industry that have now
given birth to the ISBA, we decided to take the easy way out and send our
intrepid reporter Carvon Greverr to round up some opinions from our
local tycoon, Joe Shugli, owner and operator of Generica Starships.
Carvon found Joe in his office, feet up, reviewing a mock-up of a ship
design...


CrystalIron Age:  So, Joe, what\'s that?  New model?

Joe Shugli:  No, just our standard Far Trader - sold a bunch of them
             this year.

CA:  So why are you looking at it?

JS:  Well, let\'s just say a little bird told me that the ISBA is going to
     be doing a design competition on this little item.

CA:  Really?  The official vote isn\'t closed until next week.

JS:  Vote, you say?  Well, you can believe in that democracy stuff if
     you want - I trust my little bird and his cred account more.

CA:  Interesting.  So, are you going to do any modifications for the 
     competition?

JS:  Hell no!  Maybe a coat of shiny slip-glow paint to impress the 
     judges - they wouldn\'t know a good design if it came up and bit 
     them where the sun don\'t shine, if you get my drift.

CA:  So you\'re saying your peers don\'t know anything about naval
     engineering?

JS:  Never said that!  They\'re good engineers - just most of them aren\'t 
     worth a pitcher of warm spit as businessmen.  They come out of school
with more equations than you can shake a stick at, and not a lick of
sense.  Customer comes in, asks for something, and they just fire up the
calc pit and get to it.  They never look in the catalogs to see what the
standard components are or how they can modify something off the shelf to
do the job - they just plug and chug.  Then they can\'t understand why
their clients wind up in the poorhouse and they can\'t find a bank to
finance their designs.  \'Course, some of them manage to get jobs working
for the militrary design houses - there you can rob the taxpayer blind and
only the poor sod who has to fly the thing pays in the end - with his or
her life.

CA:  So why are you joining the ISBA, then?

JS:  Publicity, pure and simple.  The smart business-sophont is going to
     buy our stuff whether we win or not.  Remember, ISBA is going to
publish data packages on all the entries, not just the winners.  We use
only Sylea Industry Norm (SIN) modules - excuse me, Imperial Data Package
Standard modules - or MilSpec modules, and the smart business-sophont
knows that you can get parts for those babies anywhere.  Plus, they
average 25% cheaper than custom jobs.  Sure, you can squeeze that extra
couple of percent of performance out with a custom design, but that don\'t
help you when you can\'t make orbit because the nearest bore-nozzle for the
hydrogen pre-injectors are 10 parsecs away.

CA:  How does that benifit your business, then?

JS:  More orders.  We\'ve got low overhead here.  We bought this plant from
     MetaDyne for next to nothing; they didn\'t catch the thrust plate
wave, and they went belly up.  Did you know test firing pits make great
wine cellars, by the way?  Anyway, as I was saying, we\'re low cost - SIN
modules are certified by the suppliers, so we don\'t have to do more than
nominal checks.  You notice we\'ve got no test pilots here - our stuff
flies first time, every time, no surprises.  Any publicity is good
publicity, and our network of suppliers is hungry for business.

CA:  So, what do you see as Generica\'s direction in the near future?

JS:  The big thing is going to be small traders, merchant ships.  By small
     I mean less than 1000 tons, and especially less than 600 tons.  Using
the old SIN-TL11 module packages, you couldn\'t build a small merchant that
was remotely near profitable.  Sure, people built them, but they mostly
lost their shirts.  Under SIN-TL12, you\'ve got some new technology that
makes those small ships competitive.  Those new small fusion plants are
real sweet - we\'re getting a fair amount of business refiting older ships
as an upgrade.  Couple that with the new thruster plates, and cargo space
goes up, operating and purchase cost go down, and bingo, now you\'ve got
ships that can go into marginal markets and not go broke.  Great
opportunity for start-up companies on the edge of the Federation, oops, I
mean Empire.

CA:  Any plans on getting into the military market, Joe?

JS:  Well, my little bird tells me that some sort of mercenary cruiser is
     in the works as the next ISBA project.  Me and the boys are mulling
some things over - nothing firm yet.  We don\'t do much military business
now, as you know - ex-fighter jocks love custom shiny knobs and pushpads,
and we don\'t cotton to that sort of thing around here.

CA:  Anything else on your mind, Joe?

JS:  Not a thing, not a thing - I\'m happy as a clam.  Want to see my new 
     wine cellar?

CA:  Sure thing!

	I couldn\'t help but notice that your income calculations are based on
Cr4000/ton for freight.  There is some debate over the accuracy of this
figure in T4;  it is Cr1000/ton in another place in the main rulebook, and
also in all previous incarnations of Traveller.  I do have to admit,
though, Cr4000/ton does make smaller starships much more commercially
viable, especially considering the increased costs of jump drives in QSDS
1.5.  Perhaps we should ask Wildstar for a Traveller Answer on this one. 
What do you think, Guy?

The Following is an reply from Commander X of X-TEK Industries
042-0001  DSS-X AX00513-C "Planet X"

Re: Outrage, Scandal, Conspiriacy, ISBA, X-TEK, Commander X

Quoted from YugoShips Press Release:

>ImperialNews Service wire 0001:42

>        YugoShips PLC Says NO to ISBA

>        Vladimir Ivankov, Chairman of the upstart shipbuilding firm
>YugoShips PLC annouced today that his company will _not_ join the nacent
>Imperial Ship Builders Association.

>        "This is blatant attempt to crowd the smaller firms out of the

You are free to chose not to join, good sir.  However I find your words 
offensive.
This is an Outrage, good sir.  We are not a criminal syndicate!  We are more 
of a "Confederation" of Shipbuilding firms, sharing ideas and technologies. 
The firms associated gain no benefit other than peaceful coexistance between 
companies and limmiting, if not totaly eliminating corporate espionage for 
example.  You confuse our firm with the Fuedal Government of our Glorious 
Imperium.  I may be a Count, good sir, but that title holds no sway in the 
Corporate politics of the ISBA.

Being a buisnessman yourself, you should know the answer to that! Simple 
supply and demand.  There is a great demand for these new ships, both 
publicly and privately, laws of economics dictate that the price should go 
up.

Not so, An X-TEK produced Far Trader has a 7.6Mcr downpaymnet. and a monthly 
paymnet of about 90,000cr.  with its 90 ton hold, 6high passengers, and 10 
low, it can easily pay that and still make a profit.

Not only that, but most of X-TEK ships are built for the military, or 
paramilitary organizations within and in the Imperium itself. X-TEK has 
always been a military/paramilitary and governmental contractor, very much 
like the ancient solomani company of "Makdhonal Dughlass".  Do you dare to 
call the Imperium corrupt?

>        "That they have include Cleon Industries, a non-shipbuilding
>company in their scheme, clearly shows the heights this gangster cartel
>reaches in the Imperium!"

This was done out of courtesy,  even in the days of our ancestors, kings and 
emperors would be given a share of a new guild, this was not only courteous, 
but in some cases LAW.  This is also done in our new Imperium.  Again you 
are not only slighting me and the ISBA, but our Emperor as well!

That one firm wouldn\'t be X-TEK now would it?  Could it have been your agent 
responsible for nearly causing X-TEK to fall to it\'s knees due to that 
corporate espionage agents botch job at instaling a worm virus?  If I hadn\'t 
have spaced him, I would now be conducting an investigation.  Had the agent 
been found out to be yours, I would have sent to you HIS HEAD!

Ahah, see even your own people are worried.  This tells me that you, yes you 
good sir are the corrupt one.  Anyone who would dare to Insult the Imperium 
and Emperor Cleon is an obvious cad!

To your workers, have you ever considered a job at X-TEK?  We take care of 
our own!

Again you continue to slander and insult the Imperium!  I cannot, and will 
not let this go unanswered...

I, Commander X, do willfully and by right mind and body, do hereby sue 
Vladimir Ivankov and YugoShips on the basis of Slander and the charge of 
Libel.  Expect a Scout Courier to serve papers to you shortly.


This is part of a speech given in the auditorial chamber of Deep Space 
Station X, by Commnader X. Broadcasted via comm net all over the station, 
and sent via Scout/Courier

"Staff  and Executives of X-TEK, Members of the ISBA, friends and 
countrymen. I ask you now to join me in this cause. Are we going to let 
these slanderous insults to continue?  I say no!  Join me in the suit 
against this slanderous cad!  For not only has he dared to insult me, and 
the ISBA, but our Glorius Emperor, Cleon I!  We have a duty to ourselves and 
our Imperium!  KEEP THE FLAME!"

"Keep the Flame" is the Commander\'s personal war cry, its origins are 
unknown, but it believed to be an ancient solomani cry used during the Rule 
of Man and before the collapse of that last Imperium.  It did not seem to 
matter, as most of the people listining in the chamber were chanting "X" 
while doing the "crossed arms salute".  Ineed the Commander has "rallied the 
troops"

Planet X has now officialy declaired itself an Amber Zone, in anticipation 
of posible corporate espionage attemps, or outright attacks by hostile 
corporate ships.

This concludes this News release form X-TEK Industries.

Aurelian Industries (Sylean Stock Exchange symbol ARI) has announced that it 
will be joining the Imperial Shipbuilders Association  (ISBA) with its own 
entrant into the current type-standardized Far Trader competition.  The 
Aurelian Industries entrant will be the YMV-6 Celestia-class Deep Space 
Trader.  The preliminary design will be unveiled at next week\'s Starship 
Architects Conference in Capitol.

This will be Aurelian Industries\' first venture into civilian shipbuilding and 
design since the attempted YMV-5 (Connestoga class) Modular Freighter project, 
which was put on hold nearly 20 years ago.  The current head of Aurelian 
Industries, Baron Alec Wardn, has personally taken over the Civilian Craft 
division of the corporation, and promises that the YMV-6 will be "the most 
popular small-cargo hauler in the Imperium."  Baron Warn, who holds a doctorate 
in Jump Space Theory from the University of Sylea, was responsible for the 
recent successful conversion of the AF-22 Deep Space Gunboat into the 
jump-capable Revenue-class Customs Cruiser for the newly-formed 
customs-enforcement fleet of the Imperial Ministry of Trade.

Aurelian Industries was formed more than 400 years ago by Aurelius Wardn as a 
private consortium to fund the reconstruction of the Badon shipyard near 
Gerrinholm, Sylea.  The Badon district has been held by the Wardn family since 
the Rule of Man, and this claim has withstood numerous legal and other 
challenges since the end of the Rule of Man.  Aurelian Industries first 
ventured into the shipbuilding industry after the rebuilding of the Badon 
Shipyard (now called Aurelia Downport) with two designs for the Sylean Navy; 
the T-32 Training Shuttle and the AF-12 Short Duration Gunboat.  Since then, 
Aurelian Industries has supplied more than 20 different small craft classes to 
the Sylean Navy, as well as two starship classes; the SA-3 (Armistead class) 
Armed Courier and the DE-7 (Gilaadin class) Destroyer Escort.  In addition, two 
other spacecraft classes have been converted to jump-capable starships.

Afraid its harder than that. Imagine the suspension reactions that would be
needed to counter any but the most glass-smooth surfaces at 600+ kph? As it is,
modern bikes at close to 200mph can get seriously out-of-shape on hitting a
bump, cornering loads or no. And, frankly, the gyrospic effect of two wheels
spinning at that rate would make the bike require power assist to steer, or a
short wheelbase, the latter making it even LESS stable. 

Sounds like fun on paper, though. I guess I always figgered in my riding that
cornering is always better than just wicking it open and watching real estate
zing by. And more fun. ;->

Careful there! That would mean that the prices in Milieu 0 should be less
than that. Or possibly the prices fluctuate. How about index-linking them
to the design version number? Yeah, that\'d make sense...

<Grudgingly> Well, I suppose MCr4.2 per displacement ton is neater than
MCr0.2857 per cubic meter...

	Anyway, here is a sample design with a starship and

- ----
The following is a transcript of the Press Conference held by
Larkiishsarshi to announce the company\'s decision to join the ISBA. Mr.
Gami Kiirneshir, a boardmember of Larkiishsarshi answered reporters\'
questions.
- ----

GK: Thank you for attending. I have some time to answer a few questions
before I have to leave to attend a planning session. You can begin sir,
yes you, with the black horn-rimmed glasses...

WWC: Winston Wong-Cronkite, Sylean Interstellar News Gathering. You are
one of the later shipbuilding firms to announce your intention to join
the ISBA. Do you think the lateness of your decision will affect your
company\'s performance or standing in the ISBA?

GK: Joining the ISBA was a decision that was not taken lightly by our
board. After much discussion, it was decided that Larkiishsarshi would
do well in joining the ISBA. Membership will enable us to keep abreast
of developments in the shipbuilding industry, enhancing our ability to
plan for contingencies in the future. Next question... yes ma\'am, with
the orange pillbox hat.

MB: Murphy Brinn, Vid News Network. Will Larkiishsarshi participate in
the upcoming tender for a J2+ Trader specification? How innovative will
your offerings be?

GK: The board has not yet reached concensus on participation in the
Tender. As for innovation in Larkiishsarshi, my answer depends on what
you mean by the word. If by "innovative" you mean the unrestrained
adoption of new and untested technologies in the design of our products,
the answer is an unqualified no. If by "innovative" you mean starships
designed for maximum efficiency and profit, yet without the penchant
many companies have for "cutting corners" the answer is yes, our
offerings will be very innovative indeed. 

MB: One more question Mr. Kiirneshir: I\'ve heard that your nickname is
"Signal GK". Can you tell us the story of that appellation?

GK: No comment. You sir, in the kimono:

KT: Kai Takahashi, Consolodated Press. You say your products will be
innovative, but how do you expect to be competitive with high-tech
designs offered by firms with a Terran style of management?

GK: Sir, if you check your Terran history, I\'m sure the same question
could have been asked to your ancestors shortly after what was called, I
believe, the Second World War. To use a Terran expression, our firm is
not out to "make a quick buck". We have long term profitability and
viability foremost in our minds. I have time for one more question...
yes, the Vargr in the back...

G: Gvaengekhvuz, Kfenzung Papers. What colour will your starships be
available in?

GK: We will let the market decide. Rest assured, Mr. Gvaengekhvuz, we
have been researching preferred colour markings for the Vargr market and
have come up with some very... innovative... colour schemes... thank you
all, I\'m very sorry, but I really must leave now.

<clamour from the crowd>
- ----

Merchant captains present at the news conference were optimistic that
Larkiishsarshi could bring some "Vilani Sensibility" to the ISBA, and
offer price competitive ships built with profit in mind.

One Captain, Ewen MacDonald, stated: "Aye, Ah\'ve flewn a Lark --
They\'rre a wee bit sloogish, but ye canna beat the \'eadroom."

**Char mode off **

On that last post I also mentioned something about the X-TEK Far Trader,
that info was in error based on current design specs and info, that has
been updated due to recent posts regarding Merchant ship
incomes/expenses.
My next post will deal with a personal system developed for figuring out
stuff like that.

all figues are in terms of months, one month equals 2 "trips", and each
"trip" is 2 weeks

what i have done is taken the income of each element, subtracted cost,
and multied by 2 to come up with profit per item per month.

Hi Passage 16,000cr (10000-2000)x2
Mid Passage 12,000cr (8000-2000)x2
Lo Passage   1,800cr  (1000-100)x2
Frieght      2,000cr/ton  (1000)x2
Cargo@100%sales, no mods  10,000cr/ton(5,000)x2)

Lets assume a 35Mcr Far Trader
with 10Lg sr and 10Low berth and 75tons cargo space
1/240th is about 145,000cr/month
anual maint is 1/1000th or about 35,000cr/yr or 2917cr/month
lets just round up and say total expences are 175,000cr/month

Now the upkeep costs are already delt with in the above values, so its
now easy to find the break even point.  Just mix and matxh cargo space
and passage.

For our example we need 175,000 or the repo man gonna be sending the
"boyz" after you. 
ok to make it for this month you need:

5 High passage = 80,000cr
5 Mid passage = 60,000cr
35 tons (bout half) freight =35,000cr

Added up should be 175,000cr, just what Don Giovani wants, and no legs
get broken, capishe? :-)  And we didnt even have anyone in low berth.
Now fill the rest of the hold with speculative cargo and wheel and
deal!  Thats what being a trader is all about.

Please feel free to check my summs, I know I can macke meshtackez.

Sylea Day 41-0000:

QuipTech Industries, makers of the only Imperial approved starship parts has
been granted an Honorary Membership into the ISBA.  In an announcement today
from their offices on Sylea, Director Savant told reporters that this
announcement came as a surprise for everyone.

"Most shipyards are already familiar with us, and as the only Imperial
approved parts producing agency, we already do business with the charter
members of the ISBA.  However, our inclusion comes as a pleasant surprise.
We intend to work in cooperation with the ISBA in providing the standard for
design throughout the Imperium."

Director Savant continued to say that the ISBA had been issued both standard
price lists as well as guidelines for pricing custom items.  As the approved
parts suppliers for Imperial contracts, QuipTech will undoubtedly see a
financial boom with this announcement, as well as the ISBA\'s upcoming design
competition.  It is rumored that THUDDD Enterprises, QuipTech\'s management
subsidiary will become the directing organization for this design competition.

The ISBA was not available for comment.

**RPG off

Well, like Roderick, I don\'t think it would be appropriate for me to submit
a design for the competition; however, I foundthe idea of the ISBA
intriguing and I didn\'t want to miss the fun. :)  From now on, when you look
at QSDS, think, "QuipTech\'s standard equipment price catalogue" and when you
look at SSDS, think, "QuipTech\'s guide for custom designs."  I think the
THUDDD enterprises part is obvious. :)  When NAH comes out, I guess we will
have to make allowances for individual shipyards to create their own custom
equipment, but for now, Big Daddy Cleon says, "Use QuipTech or forget
Imperial Contracts."

I think that the TNE description is valid for the above reason!

 YugoShips PLC Says NO to ISBA

 Vladimir Ivankov, Chairman of the upstart shipbuilding firm
YugoShips PLC announced today that his company will _not_ join the
nacent Imperial Ship Builders Association. 

 "This is blatant attempt to crowd the smaller firms out of the
business. In my experience these Business \'Associations\' always seem
to ask higher and higher membership fees, they collude to rig bids,
and are generally a gangsters impediment to true free trade.

Though the ISBA has not finished forming the basic organizational
structure its growing membership disproves this statement completely.
ISBA membership is not only made up of large corporations but small
ones as well.  We also have firms from other parts of the known space.
 We have . \'tiihkeer\'reexkaap Industries from the Two Thousands
worlds, FeZUnA of the Confederation of Altec, and EuroAmerican
 Peoples State Spacelines, of Terra.  These are just a few examples of
the growing membership, which growing at a fantastic pace.  The ISBA
stands not for the pushing out of small firms but for supporting them.



 "As an example, hot on the heels of this announcement; comes an
across-the-board, Imperium wide increase in the price of Jump Drives,
the lifeblood technology of interstellar trade. Why Drive prices have
gone up
 to 14 TIMES their old price!"

Though Supply and demand are responsible for most of the cost rise we
believe the ISBA can reduce some known price gouging.

As for CmdrX and his believes that he will come under attack Founder
Ship Works support him and will do every thing to prevented such an
attack.  We do not need the new Imperium being destroyed by those who
seek its growth.

Just before this report was released to us from Founder Ship Works it
was reported that several recently finished Founder 5000 load with
unknown cargo\'s and the one working Founder Explore lifted off. 
Rumors have it that the Ships are ahead for Plant X.

whinning about doing only recon missions? 

Well here at Reddkneck Arms and Munitions have solutions for those fighter
jocks.

Take out those det-nuke warheads on those missiles and replace them with
our "Habanero" line of proximity nukes.

Are your weapons engineers being nay sayers, that you can\'t hit spacecraft
at long distances with a contact warhead, well set the nuke for proximity
blast. Those concussion x-rays will make those enemy warships respect your
missiles, and also give the crew a "dose" that they will remember for long
time, if not forever.

Hell, the "Habanero" line is small enough, you have more than one warhead!!
Imagine the looks on the target warship\'s crew faces when they get
bracketed by brace of prox nukes.

The following the is listing of TL-15 nukes, taken from a article by Bertil
Jonell and Guy Garnett, the volumes and mass were recalculated using 3G3
using Striker shell sizes for the various yields. Additional yields were
calculated beyond the original article. At various Tech levels the only
values that change are the volumes and mass, penetrations remain constant.

Remember to get the USP for the CSC pen divide by ten.

    'index' => 'bg087',
    'body' => 'Sylean Shipping News, Year 1 Day 42

Interview: Hengabar Spofulam, CEO of Famille Spofulam

        As part of our ongoing series of interviews with industry
personalities, today we bring you an interview with Hengabar Spofulam, CEO
of the Famille Spofulam Group and patriarch of the extended kin group that
owns and runs it.  Our reporter met with Mr. Spofulam in his luxurious
offices on FSG\'s orbital corporate headquarters:

SSN:  Mr. Spofulam...

HS: Please... call me Hengabar.

SSN:  Right.  Hengabar.  Very well, we\'d like to begin by asking about your
impressions of the inaugural meeting of the ISBA; how did it go?

HS: Very well, all told.  While there were a wide variety of companies
present, the divergent corporate cultures didn\'t prove to be too much of a
problem.  Everybody got along just fine.  It was a pleasure to see our old
clients Venn and Eckil finally getting into the building end of the
business, too.  Those two sure know how to make a buck while having a good
time, let me tell you...  we\'re really going to have to watch our backs
with those two around, heh heh.

SSN: You mean Venn Beyer and Eckil Suristen?  But what about all the
rumours of their shady dealings and substance abuse?

HS: Pah!  You can\'t get ahead in business without stepping on a few toes...
while Vennie and Eck might be a little, er, _flamboyant_ in terms of their
personal style, they\'re pretty sharp operators nonetheless.  And before you
bring up those ridiculous criminal charges, let\'s just say that in our
system that you\'re innocent until proven guilty unless you\'re as successful
as those two, in which case everyone calls you guilty \'cause they\'re
jealous.  In fact, I think that the charges were complete fabrications
machinated by their competitors; that sort of abuse of the legal system is
despicable...

SSN: But what about FSY\'s high-profile lawsuits against Rohzeicollis
Aagaporniz, head of Ling Standard\'s shipbuilding division?

HS: That\'s completely different!  Aagaporniz was defaming us in the press,
and we had to take steps to preserve our good name!  It\'s not like we were
acting in restraint of trade, Bog forbid...

SSN: Er, right.  Well, other than that, what were your impressions of the
ISBA meeting?

HS: Well, there weren\'t any rocks lying about the place, so we were all
safe from ol\'Arameth <chuckles>.

SSN: You mean Sir Arameth Gridlore?  Is there any truth to the rumours that
you two, well, to put it bluntly, hate each other\'s guts?

HS: Naaaw... not a bit of it.

SSN: Now, what about the comments made by some ISBA participants that your
remarks about the ISBA implied that you envisaged it having a
union-busting, lobbying, and price-fixing role?

HS: <laughs contemptuously> Bah.  What part of freedom of association,
freedom of contract, and freedom of association don\'t they understand?  A
new era is dawning, sonny.  With the coming galacticization of the Imperial
economy, the only enterprises that are going to survive are those that are
lean and mean and hungry; and union shops are anything but.  We find that
we can build ships for less in our non-union operations, and we simply pass
on those savings to the customer...

SSN: But Famille Spofulam has a reputation for being one of the priciest
firms around...

HS: Of course.  We\'re also one of the best.  And to put it bluntly,
building a Caligula in a union yard would take twice as long and cost more.
I mean, really...  Unions?  Hah!  This is Year 0!  If you aren\'t with the
program, you bloody well ought to expect debugging!

SSN: Still on the topic of your labour practices, is it true that younger
Spofulam family members are expected to serve in multi-year unpaid
internships in Spofulam businesses?

HS: Well, that\'s a family matter, so it\'s private, but lets just say that
my great-grandkids are getting a lot out of the company, in the form of
trust funds and grav bikes  and roofs over their heads, so it\'s only fair
that they put a little back into the company.  Besides, I think that it
builds character and discipline, and gives them invaluable experience for
when they\'re ready to join management...

SSN: Right...  finally, what do you have to say about the rumours
circulating about difficulties with FSY\'s first mass-market effort, the
CDB-1, that\'s it\'s completely uneconomical?

HS: Well, what do you expect?  You get designers that are used to building
racing grav cycles, and tell them to build an air raft, you\'re going to get
one hell of an air raft, let me tell you... <chuckles>  But seriously, we
here at HQ are taking the CDB-1 project fairly seriously.  We had the
entire design tem away for a re-orientation seminar prior to the project...

SSN: The news along the grapevine is that it was actually a mass
detoxification cure...

HS: That\'s just a load of crap!  Those stories are just a bunch of
malarkey; sure the boys like to party, but the rumours about rampant
substance abuse in the design bureau were just that, and if we find out
who\'s spreading them, you can bet they\'ll be hearing from our legal
department!  But anyhow, back to the CDB-1, yes, the design boys are going
to be reworking it from the ground up; the concept is as sound as they
come; it was just the implementation that was a little too upscale...  I
mean if YugoShips PLC tried to muscle into our end of the market, it\'d take
them a while to adapt,too...

        Geez... no; I completely forgot about refuelling.  Methinks I\'m
going to go back to the drawing board.  OTOH, I think that this points out
a problem with SSDS and the T4 rules; the CDB-1 is a plain, plain vanilla
ship, with pretty minimal capabilities, but it can\'t make money according
to the T4 rules.  I figure it\'s a case of the econ rules being built around
the TLAR designs in the rulebook.

        I\'m going to try for a redesign tonight.  If it doesn\'t come out in
the green I\'m going to adopt the $4,000 cr/ton as a house rule in my
campaign if anyone survives this week...

    'body' => '        As per Steve Charlton\'s request, here are the THUDDD
rules/guidelines/things that you might want to abide by.  Note the update
on econ... seems I forgot fuel costs too:

Use Wildstar\'s Improved USD Format (appended below).

Append the following economic information:

1) Financing costs: as per p.96 of the T4 manual, assume a 20% down
payment, with monthly payments of 1/240th of the cost of the ship for 480
months.  Put in amount of down payment and monthly payment.

2) Monthly crew salaries (as per the crew salary table on p.113 of the T4
manual).  For those who don\'t have the T4 manual, pilots earn 6,000
cr/month, Navigators 5,000 cr/month, Engineers 4,000/month, Medics
2,000/month, and Gunners 1,000 cr/month.  Use the Skill-1 numbers to
reflect possibility of owner-operator(s) lowering costs... it\'s a
compromise.

3) Monthly life support costs: 2,000 cr/2-week trip per occupied stateroom,
200 cr/2-week trip per low berth (see p.97 T4 manual).  Double these to
give monthly cost of full occupancy.

4) Annual maintenance costs: 1/1000th of the total cost of the starship per
annum.  Divide this by 12 to give a monthly figure.

5) Refuelling costs; use refined fuel numbers if the ship doesn\'t have
purification facilities, unrefined otherwise.  Calculate two fills per
month.

6) Total monthly costs: Add up all of the monthly costs above.  This is
what you\'ve got to earn in order to break even.

7) Maximum monthly revenues: at 1,000 cr/ton of cargo, how much revenue
will it generate per trip at 100% capacity?  Likewise, factor in passengers
if carried (10,000 cr for a high passage, 8,000 for a medium, and 1,000 for
a low passage), and mail (5,000 cr/ton up to 5 tons if the ship is armed).
Calculate the total maximium revenue assuming full passenger occupancy and
5 tons of mail (don\'t forget to subtract 5 tons worth of cargo to make room
in the hold for the mail).

8) Breakeven point: at 1,000 cr/ton, how many tons of cargo/how many
passengers  must be carried in order to meet the total monthly costs.

Except one:  The fuel tankage for HEPlaR drives is still wrong.  The
volumes listed on the new chart are sufficient only for *one* hour of
operation, not 20.  I\'m assuming the changes are intended to bring QSDS
into line with SSDS/FFS.  If According to FFS and SSDS, a 1 dTon HEPlaR
drive requires 140MW of power and consumes 35 kl (2.5 dTons) of fuel /per
hour/.  If you want 20 hours of endurance for a drive this size, you\'ll
need 50 dTons of fuel.

Don\'t get me wrong, though.  QSDS 1.5 is very good.  It\'s just not
error-free, though (yet).

additional change to the system.

Regarding HEPlaR-equipped starships (Yes, I still try to use HEPlaR), I
believe the Maneuver drive entry should include information for fuel usage,
duration at maximum burn, and the number of G-turns carried (a "turn" being
defined in terms of whatever combat system you happen to be using).

For example:
	## Maneuver (HEPlaR, ## Mw, ## hours @ max G, ## G-turns available)

Wherein the number of G-turns available would be equal to the # of hours at
max. G, multiplied by the rating of the Drive, multiplied again by the
number of turns in an hour.  I use 30 minute turns, so a 2G HEPlaR drive
with 10 hours of fuel endurance at max G would have a total of 10 x 2G x
2turns/hour = 40 burns of available maneuvering fuel, at 1G per burn.

Dear FlashNet customer,

We are writing you this to inform you of a very important matter 
currently under review by the FCC.  Your local telephone company has
filed a proposal with the FCC to impose per minute charges for your 
internet service. They contend that your usage has or will hinder 
the operation of the telephone network.  

It is our belief that internet usage will diminish if users were required
to pay additional per minute charges.  The FCC has created an email box for
your comments; responses must be received by February 13, 1997.  Send
your comments to isp@fcc.gov and tell them what you think.

Alert everyone in your addressbook, and most importantly the subject
line should have "CC Docket No 96-263". FULL NAME AND ADDRESS SHOULD
ACCOMPANY THE EMAIL otherwise it will be deleted. Again, the email to FCC is
isp@fcc.gov 

More information can be found at the FCC website:
	http://www.fcc.gov/isp.html

Please forward this email to all your friends on the internet so all our
voices may be heard.

Thanks for your time.

    'body' => 'Rannoch asks "Is the ISBA Good for Business?"
  by Arle Flanigan

(Auburn, Sylea) Lady Regan Reid, speaking from Rannoch House today,
expressed concern over the formation of the Imperium Ship Builders
Association, "Industry Associations often turn into anti-competitive
cartels.  Knowing many of the founding members we are sure that isn\'t the
objective here.  Still we view the situation with some concern."  She went
on to say that Rannoch wishes the ISBA well, but that the conglomerate will
not be applying for membership, at this time.

Rannoch House, is the parent of several subsidiaries involved in the design
and manufacture of ship components.  The best known of the Rannoch
subsidiaries are Rannoch Reactors (RR) - the largest independent
manufacturer of fusion power plants on Sylea, and Michaelson Coil and
Impeller, Ltd (MCI) - a well respected maneuver and jump drive
manufacturer.  None of the Rannoch subsidiaries build ships, commercially,
but as Lady Reid reminded the assembled
reporters, "We don\'t build the ships, we make the ships fly."

This reporter asked about rumors that Rannoch is about to enter the
shipbuilding business, Lady Reid refused to comment on speculations
concerning the future.  She added, "We have a good working relationship
with our customers, the shipbuilding companies. Regardless, of what the
future holds we want to maintain that friendly, and profitable
relationship."

When asked about recent price increases on Jump Drives instituted by QSDS
Corp, Lady Reid commented, "QSDS had to increase their prices to meet their
costs.  They have been trying to buy market share for several months with
ridiculously low prices for inefficient, perhaps even sub-standard drives. 
I think it\'s obvious they have discovered they can\'t make any money that
way.  Our higher prices have always reflected the quality of our drives,
and we don\'t anticipate price increases, at this time.  In fact, the
research division at MCI is working on some promising new technologies that
might lower both maneuver and jump drive prices in the future."

She refused further comment.

table in Sam\'s post, and have not checked his numbers or his conversions.
Sam\'s table is NOT official, and also is NOT a part of my recommended set of
variants (such as QSDS 1.5 and RPSC).

What a combo!  I\'m not sure the numbers mean anything, though.

> Remember to get the USP for the CSC pen divide by ten.

This is almost certainly wrong, for any version of the USP.

It\'s worth noting (since I didn\'t see it in Sam\'s post) that the original
article also suggested that "contact" hits be 4 _levels_ of difficulty
harder than an ordinary weapon task, and "concussion" (which seems to be what
the original article termed "near proximity") be 3 levels more difficult.

    'body' => 'Arcadia Shipyards announced today that they have begun design work on a
series of vessels to meet the Imperial Ship Builders\' Association (ISBA)
"Far Trader" specification.

"The design is a refinement of our existing line of starships", said
Mr. Kodai Tadashi, President of Arcadia Shipyards.  "The bulk of the design
work is finished, and expect to have a final specifcation and holographic
walkthrough available to the ISBA and interested memebers of the press
within a week."

Several members of the press were quick to ask Mr. Tadashi for his reaction
to the statements by Generica Shipyards and YugoShips PLC. accusing the ISBA
of being a union-breaking or monopolistic cartel.  He accused Generica and
YugoShips of "creating trouble" in the industry where none existed before.

"Arcadia Shipyards has always been able to offer superior design and
workmanship on our products while holding the line on prices due to our
strong vertical integration througout the entire starship design and
construction process", he said.

"I believe that we can offer starships that are superior in design,
materials, and workmanship at prices that equal or better our competition."
Mr. Tadashi included YugoShips PLC and Generica in that declaration, saying
"Both companies are well-known for producing second-rate vessels at low
prices.  If you look at Arcadia\'s offerings, you will see that a
high-quality starship can be had for practically the same price."

Quelling roumors that the ISBA is intended as a "union breaking"
organization, Mr. Tadashi noted that Arcadia Shipyards has typically enjoyed
good relations with the unions.  "Although Arcadia is an \'open\' shop [union
membership is not required], 43% of our employees choose to be represented
by a union or craft organization, and we are not seeking to change our
relationship with the organized labor force."

"Our workers are amoung the most productive in the industry, and are our
most valuable assets."  Mr. Tadashi offered for proof of this the facts that
Arcadia\'s pay and benefit packages are above the average for the industry,
and the company\'s lay-off rate is the lowest for any shipyard in the
subsector.

Alpher/Solomani Rim: Crashland City News

  Following in the wake of enormous profits reaped from sales of the highly
successful Kestrel and Corvette lines of military starships, the local
shipbuilding firm "Custom Built Wreckage" announced its intent to join the
ISBA.
  
  "This represents an exciting new chapter in the history of this company,"
Chairman and CEO Grabow Freem said at a recent press conference.  "This is
the first time CBW has participated in a major Pan-Imperial project of this
scale." 

  Since the announcement, Custom Built Wreckage stock (code CBW) gained
6.25 points on the ISX boards, jumping from Cr32.75 to Cr39 per share. 

  When asked which project he would prefer to work on, President Freem geve
the following comments: "As you know, the majority of our production is
dedicated to military ships, but I feel we are ready to begin production of
civilian starships.  It would greatly expand our market and allow us to
reap immense profits and become even more obscenely wealthy.  HA
HAHAHAHAHA!" 
  
  President Freem then ordered another Pan-Galactic Garle Blaster and
adjourned the meeting.

  ISBA representatives could not be reached for comment.

  After recovering from his hangover, President Freem called a press
conference to announce that Custom Built Wreckage will begin production of
two new starship classes, the CBW-A-0000-1 Far Trader and the CBW-C-0000-2
"Claymore" Mercenary Cruiser "yesterday, dammit!"

  Actual production is expected to begin within the week.

  ISBA representatives still could not be reached for comment.

Well up to the 100kt range the conversion is performed using the 3G3
conversion as per the T4 conversion section ie a 100kt has of
25000/2(hardness of TNE Steel)=12500. 12500^.33=22.49. 22.49*6(CSC Steel
Hardness)=134.94 rounded to 135.

That is way all of the one from 100kt to 50t were figured. The ones greater
than 100kt were extrapolated. If you can provide the formula to get the
results you got I will happy and eager to make any corrections that might
be needed.

I never stated that any of the values were OFFICIAL just as they were. You
did not quote the rest of the paragraph

..Additional yields were calculated beyond the original article....

I never stated that you were directly involved did I? Please check my
numbers if you feel they are out of line, but give the formula so I can do
the same to yours.<G>

I also never said they were for any QSDS X.x or RPSC did I.

But 3G3 is the OFFICIAL nonstarship weapons design system.

Sounds like you are getting a little too tightly wound up over making sure
that you are disclaiming involvement

Well Striker has a TL 15 100kt nuke as shell size 25-9(for TL)=16 cm. I
used a table from 3G3 taking 1.6cm, 3 to 1 shell gives a volume of 8.58 cc
but since the shell I want is 16cm, I have to multiple by 1000 to get the
volume of 16cm shell= 8,580cc. This rule is stated in the 3G3 book to get
shells larger than listed. One cubic meter is 100*100*100=1,000,000cc. So
dividing 8,580 by 1,000,000 is 0.00858 m3. I used the sg of depleted
uranium listed in 3G3 which is 11, so 11 * 85,580=94,380g. 94,380g divided
by 1000 to get kilos and then by 1000 to get metric tons=0.094t

So TL 15 100kt is .00858 m3 and masses .094 metric tons.

This the same format used for the volumes if the shells ranging from 7cm to
16cm. The shells greater than 100kt followed the progression in striker.

Cost is yield times 10,000cr or .01MCr plus cost of HE shell of the same
size. I did not factor up the cost of the HE shell due the small additional
cost that it adds.
  
>> Remember to get the USP for the CSC pen divide by ten.

You are correct, the table that Greg Porter sent with the message titled
"Greasy Tidbits.." is

I think in starship terms, penetrations would convert to USP as follows:

Pen		USP
0-16		0-0-0-0
17-20		1-0-0-0
21-25		2-0-0-0
26-29		3-0-0-0
Going beyond this but following the progression is
Pen           USP
30-35         4-0-0-0
36-40         5-0-0-0 
and so on.
A pen of 135 well it off the scale for right now.

Yes I referred readers to get the article for further details. 

But you see for may purposes, that increased difficulty does not matter. I
will use multiple warhead packages in a 10m3 warhead package I can put
10,217 warheads of 50t Thermonuclear force at cost of 5.1 MCr. That warhead
package will hit just like your cannister rounds. Yes a Nuclear shotgun!!!!
<G>

I can also put 831 warheads of 100kt at cost of 831 MCr, yes very expensive
but with pen of 135 equal to 800cm of Toughness 15 CSC armor, it will ruin
the 1,000MCr warships day for good.

As for how they go boom that will released later with the Reddkneck Arms
and Munitions "Bubba" and "Little Bubba" CANON missile systems.

I am attempting to put the teeth back in missiles and fighters for T4, I
think that it is going in the right direction.

Guy using 3G3 the volume of 10mm sphere is .524cm3 times a sg of 11 for
depleted uranium is 5.76g your article list the cannister rounds as 10mm
10g titanium spheres, what did you use for the sg of titanium?

   the cargo bay?  Then how much space do they fill?
 * If electronics crew are 0.2 or more, you round up.  Since the
   most basic TL12 sensors and commo total 0.8, every ship should
   have at least one electronics crewman.  [Not a problem, exactly,
   but an observation.]

   do we round up or down at 0.5?  I think this used to read
   "rounded down to the nearest whole number".  Otherwise, we
   get dedicated command officers on three or four person ships,

   not clear.  What jobs can be eliminated?  What happens if the
   ship then enters combat (or a dangerous situation) anyway?  
   Is operating with reduced crew permitted on commercial vessels?
 * In a non-QSDS matter, what are Electronics crew paid?  Or

   Electronics the same; Command was double that.  So, are we
   talking Cr 5000 for Electronics and Cr 10000 for Command,

    'body' => 'I\'ve been pretty quiet lately because I haven\'t had a lot of time to 
share with my fellow Traveller fanatics, but tonight I was browsing 
the IG web site and stumbled across proposed errata for the critical 
hit rule in T4.

This was in my House Rules that I posted some time ago, but I just 
wanted to mention this for those who did not see them.  My group 
really likes our version of this rule.

Instead of the first hit always being considered a critical hit (all 
of the damage from the entire roll is taken randomly from one of the 
three hit point characteristics), we have been doing something a 
little different.  

We didn\'t like the first hit always being considered a critical hit.  
I understand the meaning behind the rule in that it gives an 
advantage to whoever draws first blood, but what about later in the 
conflict.  Isn\'t it reasonable that a perfect hit could be achieved 
on a target on, say, the fifth round of combat when the target is 
starting to feel the strain of combat fatigue?

And why tempt "rules-players" to minorly injure themselves only to 
declare later in the combat that they have already taken damage and 
cannot be effected by the first blood critical hit rule.

Our answer to this to allow critical hits when spectacular success is 
rolled.  In this way, it is not automatic.  Indeed, the PCs even live 
longer, and this rule gives a benefit to rolling spectacular success 
in combat.  

Critical hits, under our system, are not automatic the first time a 
character gets damaged, and if several spectacular success are rolled 
against one character (however unlikely), then several critical hits 
can be rolled against him.

You may say that this is too much of an advantage allowing characters 
to usually survive at least one shot in combat.

Well, not so, says I.  We also use expanded medical rules (also in my 
House Rules), and in them, there is a rule for wound deterioriation.  
If medical help is not received in the specified time (longer for 
superfical and minor wounds--shorter time periods for serious and 
critical wounds), then a check is made to see if the wound 
deteriorates.  If this roll is failed, then the character starts 
takeing additional damage until either treatment is received or the 
character dies.

I think that this is a good, realisitic trade off from the rules as 
written in the main book.

Far from deriding him, I think you gotta admire a guy who\'s willing to take
on such a cartel of high-powered corporations, but who insists on walking
around unarmed and without armor. A brave man, that Ivankov.

  Well, yes, that\'s an issue for shipyard engineers or the ref.
But it does address the original issue within extant material, 
without boundary problems from, for example, -10% per TL mods.

  For a somewhat unhelpful article on Traveller engineering and
economics, see Space Gamer #49.

  Compressing hydrogen; presumably you can\'t significantly at common
TL\'s, or it would already be done, but if my campaign warranted it,
I\'d do it.  As for sponge-like intersticial storage methods, that
brings up the really exciting question of mass.  If 14 m(3) of
titanium stores ten metric tons/displacement tons of hydrogen, great,
but you must buy it, and push the mass around.  Have fun with the math.
(Note, that\'s from a Striker book 3 fan, it\'s probably not an issue in T4)

  According to HG, all starships have capacitors equal to 0.5%
of the ship per Jump number.  This may no longer be the case.
I assume that the jump fuel is dumped (somewhere) as coolant
when the capacitors are discharged and the ship enters jumpspace.
Of course, certain CT artifacts may appear to violate J-fuel
requirements to large degrees.

  Good luck with the THUDD, and may the best (large, hooved, herbivore) win.

    'body' => 'For Immediate release 042-0
Times of Sylea interviews Capt. Sir Jerami Danjo (CEO, Phoenix
Corporation) regarding the ISBA

TS: Sir Jerami, the Phoenix Corporation is one of the charter
    members of the ISBA, what do you see as the role of the new
    organisation?

JD: Well, to put it simply, if the new Imperium is going to prosper
    and roll back the Long Night, it\'s going to need starships. The
    shipbuilding industry is going to be a major growth area of the
    Imperial economy; and quite frankly the health of the industry
    will have a strong influence on the overall health of the economy.
    Given that, its vital that the industry has a single united voice
    at the highest levels. The primary role of the ISBA is to provide
    that voice.

TS: So the ISBA is not a monopolistic cartel?

JD: Certainly not, no more than the Imperial Collage of Surgeons or
    the Bar Association of Sylea are.

TS: What about the recent comments by Hengabar Spofulam, may I quote
    "...to present a common front against the omnipresent threat of
     the organized labour movement, ... by allowing members to work
     towards developing more optimal common pricing agreements.."?
    This would indicate that the ISBA is going to take an anti-union
    position and doesn\'t on the face of it seem to encourage competition.

JD: Well, this is really two statements, best viewed independently.
    As regards Mr Spofulam\'s opinions on orgainsed labour, Hengabar
    is renowned as a hardedged negotiator, and FYS is a union free shop;
    but they are but one member of the ISBA. Here at Phoenix, we are
    more than comfortable with unionisation, we feel the higher level
    of productivity one gets from a motivated union worker more than
    makes up for the slightly higher wages. One has to remember that
    ones workforce is any businesses most valuable assest, especially in
    such a highly skilled industry as ours. The bottom line is, you can\'t
    afford to mistreat your workers, after all there are just so many
    ways a spanner can "accidentally" fall into a multimillion credit
    piece of machinery.

TS: But with respect Sir Jerami, you\'ve not mentioned his comments on
    "common pricing".

JD: Well the industry is highly competative and I can\'t see that changing.

TS: Would you care to elaborate on that, Sir Jerami?

JD: Certainly, every yard has a bottom line and they have to meet it. But
    the very nature of the industry keeps it honest. Just look at the
    recent IISS scoutship tender, no less than 17 different compeating
    bids. Every contract is fiercely contested and every yard strains to
    get every credit they can off their tender. A cartel is just not going
    to happen nowadays, this is not the bad old days of the mid Sylean era.
    Anyway, the Imperial Ministry of Commerce comes down hard on price
    fixing; just look at what happened to Synor Fusion; a hundred million
    credit fine is a very good incentive to stay honest.

TS: What about the recent increases in Jump drive prices?

JD: Well informed industry commentators had been predicting an increase
    was imminent for some time. Just look at how Lanthinum prices have
    spiralled in the last few years. Then theres the removal of the
    Imperial QSDS subsidy. These things do add up and eventually these
    costs have to be passed on. Hyperspatial contollers have gone up
    in price 300% over the past year alone. These increases have to be
    expected in any growth industry.

TS: But 1400%, doesn\'t that seem a little exessive?

JD: Well, I will admit, it would seem a little steep to those outside the
    industry, but I can assure you that it is reasonable given the
    circumstances. The IISS were quite happy to accept the increases on
    our P-200EX design; and they are hardly known for throwing money away.

TS: Several smaller yards have expressed concerns that the ISBA will act
    to "freeze" them out of the market, do you have any comment of this?

JD: Small companies are always worried about this; and I can understand
    their concerns. But one just has to look at the companies that have
    joined the ISBA; its not just the big corporates, there are plenty of
    the smaller up and coming players in there too. The ISBA recognises
    that these smaller yards are some of the most inovative and creative
    around. The big corporates like GSbAG, Phoenix, Arcadia etc. with our
    established client base have to be at least a little conservative in
    our approach; where as the smaller yards can afford to be experimental.
    One of the good things about the ISBA will be the increased level of
    support we can give the smaller yards.

TS: You mention that the larger yards have to be conservative in approach,
    do you think the ISBA might act as a break to technological inovation?

JD: Definintely not, the ISBA will be a positive boon to inovation by
    facilitating joint research, technology sharing and cross licencing.
    Just look at the sums spent on R&D; over MCr1,000 by Phoenix alone
    last year. The ISBA will provide a proper clearing house for new
    technologies whilst ensuring proper protection for intellectual
    property.

TS: What about the purchase of Holva Industries shipyards? The new owners
    are widely reputed to have criminal connections. Will the ISBA be able
    to prevent the entry of organised crime into the industry and prevent
    the access of criminal pirates to advanced ships?

JD: Well, Messers Beyer and Suristen have not been convicted of anything;
    and the last time I looked it was still innocent until proven guilty.
    I\'m sure if theres anything thats not entirely above boards there,
    they\'ll be brought to account for it. If there\'s one thing you can
    be certain of, its that. The Imperial Ministry of Justice may not be
    the fastest organisation around, but they are through and persistant.
    One of the benefits of the ISBA will be in ensuring that proper
    professional and ethical standards are maintained. If there\'s any
    legitimate cause for concern, the ISBA will be at the forefront of
    exposing it. Any growth industry is going to attract its less than
    savoury elements and you need to have an organisation like the ISBA
    to keep them in check.
    As to piracy, well its self evident that its in the interests of the
    industry to stamp this out. Piracy discourages interstellar shipping;
    and without interstellar shipping theres no need for ship builders.
    I can\'t see it being a major problem.

TS: Thank you for your time Sir Jerami, I wish the ISBA well.

What about the salaries of electronics operators, stewards and crew

CT gives stewards a salary of Cr3,000 per month a hefty sum.

Well, it seems that Piper\'s third novel about them contradicts the two
non-Piper Fuzzy books. And on the whole, I prefer his background.

Fuzzies are too small to be highly intelligent, but they are more than
bright enough for some kinds of job. Other than the moral questions
involved in using something that is on average as bright as a 6-10 year
old child in dangerous jobs, they would make *great* scouts. I can see
Fuzzies as part of the crew on survey missions.

ps. I never got a chance to make use of Fuzzies in another area that I
thought they\'d fit well. I planned to add them to a D&D campaign.
There\'s a *reason* why kobolds are so nervous. :-)

How do you connect to your ISP.....by dialing a local phone number.....
All calls going to that number can be assessed a per minute charge.....

In the long term it may not be in the best interest of the phone
companies.....
but for now while the communication market as a whole is getting more
competitive.....a quick buck like this type of charge maybe a needed shot
in 
the arm of some companies.....

It has been mentioned in the Florida Times-Union here in Jacksonville three
times in the last 4 weeks.....

I do not know if has gotten as far as the FCC yet, but I do know that there
have been discussions about some type of per minute charge to offset the
cost of upgrading the infrastructure to ensure that Internet usage does not
tie up local communication resources.....

One item regarding the cable companies and their Internet
access.....although your initial access will be over the cable systems
wires the end point will be a node on the local phone network just as if
you had dialed into a local phone number.....My roommate works for the
local cable company.....

The charge may never materialize but it is being discussed.....

     Pan-Imperia Has Failure in First Test, Testing Grounds Damaged

(Hazan, CORE)  Officials at the Pan-Imperia Shipyards and Servicing corporate
headquarters yesterday admitted that their company was responsible for the
recent atmospheric and seismic disturbances felt planet-wide on Hazan earlier
this week. In a press conference, Saadat Abnea, Executive VP for Research 
and Development, reported that both incidents were the result of the failure
of a recent design, the BRRV-1, at Pan-Imperia\'s southern testing grounds.

"We regret the incident and any damages or inconvieniences it may have
caused to the citizens of Hazan" Abnea stated at the confierence. "In any 
field of expanding knowledge, one must expect more failures than successes, 
it is how we grow as a society. The prototype vehicle we were testing under 
the THUDDD program unfortunately broke up upon reentry into Hazan\'s atmosphere
and caused extensive damage to our testing grounds upon impact, and the 
loss of both test pilots.

"Our internal investigation leads us to suspect industrial sabotage rather than
failure of design as the cause for this event," Abnea continued. "When 
representatives of Holva arrived on planet to welcome us into the shipbuilding 
industry and express there support for organized labour, we were not then aware
that they had been bought out, or by whom. Had we known, we would have been
more suspicious of their hand delivery of the THUDDD specifications \'as a 
gesture of good will and friendly competition.\'  That combined with a sight mis-
understanding as to the nature of the THUDDD designation led to the unforturnate
incident.

"Having obtained a copy of the OFFICIAL THUDDD requirements, I have no doubt
that our crack engineering staff will be working round the clock to produce a 
vehicle that will \'break new ground\' even more so than our first design" he
concluded
to the nervous laughter of all present.

Pan-Imperia\'s first attempt at spacecraft design, the BRRV-1 (known under the
working title of Big Rock Reentry Vehicle-1) may yet become a money maker for
the company. Unnamed sources report that members of the Imperial Navy were
seen at Pan-Imperia headquarters earlier this week, and were taken on a tour of 
shipyards and testing grounds on the uninhabited southern continent of Oslin.

design a small ship that will make money carrying cargo (at CR 1,000) at
ton.  This circumstance has caused some people on the list to suggest
that the rules are broken and that the price paid for cargo should be
increased.  I believe that this line of thought is wrong.  In any set of
circumstances where the price paid for an item (cargo) is fixed it is a
good bet that this price is fixed by _law_.

	The "real" reason that the price paid for shipping cargo is CR 1,000
per ton and not a variable ammount must be that the _Imperial_law_ sets
this price.  As anyone who has ever worked in a business will tell you
the government _Does_Not_Care_ if you can make a profit (as long as you
pay your taxes).  Just because the law specifies that you must charce CR
1,000 per ton per cargo shipped on your ship does _not_ mean that you
are required to ship cargo on your ship.  If you can not make a profit
shipping cargo at this proce than _you_ should not do it.  Instead you
should concentrate on passengers and trade & speculation.  Presumably
the cargos are shipped by larger ships who can make a profit at this
price (through economies of scale).

	It is entirely possible that when he wrote CT Marc Miller (or whoever
wrote the trade setion) set the price paid for cargo at CR 1,000 at ton
knowing full well that it would be hard to make a profit at this price
because they wished to encourage trade & speculation and carrying
passengers becaue they thought that passengers & trading were more FUN
to roleplay ! It is a lot easier to come up with interesting adventures
if your ship is not simply shipping generic cargos between generic
planets at CR 1,000 a ton.

Well, my thought about storing hydrogen in titanium was for X-boats taht
doesn\'t need to thrust around a lot. Hydrogen use per jump is based solely
on Jn and displacement still? As for price of titanium, well it\'s a common
metal that is a bit hard to mine as it takes a lot of energy to do it. At
TLs with fusion energy costs will be very small so titanium is cheap.

Hi Colin,

Good point; this isn\'t the proper place for PBeM\'s to occur.  OTOH, these 
ISBA posts are *great* fodder, and of much broader appeal than a standard 
PBeM.  It\'s more like reading a piece of a full-fledged TAS business 
journal every day.  I\'d love it if IG took this stuff and put it into 
JTAS #26.  I can see a series of articles growing out of this, maybe even 
a supplement someday.  

Just MHO, of course.  If a decision is made to take the ISBA stuff off 
the TML, I\'d like to be included on whatever alternate list is set up; I 
won\'t be contributing, but I\'d like to continue to read these posts.

Well, I for my part am enjoying the ISBA-Posts!

I also am under the impression (correct me if i am wrong) that the 
TML is there for all astpects of Traveller, including the 
Roleplaying! 
Technical discussions were once upon a time supposed to be running un the 
GDW-beta list, not as much on the TML. I for my part read the TML to 
get ideas for a new campaign, adventures and, in general, Gaming use! 
Although not having much use for the Tech-Stuff, i don\'t complain.
Read what you like to read, don\'t read the rest! But please don\'t 
tell us others to stop mailing to a certain topic just because you 
don\'t like it!

Mail shouldn\'t be an issue in the competition.  Remember, you need to 
meet three conditions to carry mail.  First, you have to dedicate five
tons of cargo space at all times for mail, whether or not you are 
carrying any.  Second, you have to be armed.  Third, you have to have
a subsidy from the government.  So nobody can carry mail.  Or are we
allowing people to build Subsidized Traders for the competition?

Subject: Aurelian Industries Joins ISBA

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Aurelian Industries (Sylean Stock Exchange symbol ARI) has announced that it 
will be joining the Imperial Shipbuilders Association  (ISBA) with its own 
entrant into the current type-standardized Far Trader competition.  The 
Aurelian Industries entrant will be the YMV-6 Celestia-class Deep Space 
Trader.  The preliminary design will be unveiled at next week\'s Starship 
Architects Conference in Capitol.

This will be Aurelian Industries\' first venture into civilian shipbuilding and 
design since the attempted YMV-5 (Connestoga class) Modular Freighter project, 
which was put on hold nearly 20 years ago.  The current head of Aurelian 
Industries, Baron Alec Wardn, has personally taken over the Civilian Craft 
division of the corporation, and promises that the YMV-6 will be "the most 
popular small-cargo hauler in the Imperium."  Baron Warn, who holds a doctorate 
in Jump Space Theory from the University of Sylea, was responsible for the 
recent successful conversion of the AF-22 Deep Space Gunboat into the 
jump-capable Revenue-class Customs Cruiser for the newly-formed 
customs-enforcement fleet of the Imperial Ministry of Trade.

Aurelian Industries was formed more than 400 years ago by Aurelius Wardn as a 
private consortium to fund the reconstruction of the Badon shipyard near 
Gerrinholm, Sylea.  The Badon district has been held by the Wardn family since 
the Rule of Man, and this claim has withstood numerous legal and other 
challenges since the end of the Rule of Man.  Aurelian Industries first 
ventured into the shipbuilding industry after the rebuilding of the Badon 
Shipyard (now called Aurelia Downport) with two designs for the Sylean Navy; 
the T-32 Training Shuttle and the AF-12 Short Duration Gunboat.  Since then, 
Aurelian Industries has supplied more than 20 different small craft classes to 
the Sylean Navy, as well as two starship classes; the SA-3 (Armistead class) 
Armed Courier and the DE-7 (Gilaadin class) Destroyer Escort.  In addition, two 
other spacecraft classes have been converted to jump-capable starships.

Actually, the first hit rule makes some sense.  Studies have shown that the
first wound recieved by a soldier tends to affect his performance beyond
what could be expected for the actual damage done.  This is the shock of
realizing "I\'ve been hit!" and dealing with the sudden on-rush of pain, etc.
If a person can stand the intial hit, the odds of him surviving the combat
go way up.  Additional wounds tend to be less noticable (unless they hit
something critical, i.e., a Spectacular Sucess or an increased damage
attack) due to the high adrenaline levels in the already wounded persons system.

It say that they "accidentaly" shot through a major vein.. That\'s
unbelievably abusive, and anybody who tried it my game would be looking for
something else to do on Friday nights.

I don\'t think PC dying quickly is the big problem in Traveller combat,
indeed, as we proved on rec.games.frp.misc, it\'s damn hard to kill anybody.
Not that this is a bad thing, I\'ve always seen traveller as a "heroic"
system.  In my game, I generally look at how mucjh the SS exceeded the task
number by, and award an increased damage bonus based on that; unless there\'s
something the player wants to do with his SS, like shot the gun out of the
bad guy\'s hand.

I think we are working with a different definition of what constitues a
"critical hit".  This term doesn\'t appear in the rules, so I\'m guessing that
you\'re lumping the first hit rule in with increased damage attacks.  If I\'m
wrong please let me know.

could you repost/send these to me?  I\'d be interested in seeing them, and
I\'m setting up a website of alternate combat rules.

1) The X-Boat:
What about the 100-ton Express Boat?  Granted, X-boats tend to stay in the
background, rather than becoming actively involved in play, but they\'re a
*very* important part of that background.  As the Imperium expands, and
both fusion- and jump technology advances, an overhaul of the courier
network would be almost inevitable.

2) The Patrol Cruiser:  
If nobody is interested in the X-boat, re-designing the 400-ton patrol
cruiser would also be a good idea.  This is the kind of military vessel
adventurers (as pirates, smugglers, unauthorized visitors to Interdicted
planets, and so forth) are likely to be running into, exchanging fire
with, and running from.  Yes, I know, I already voted for the 800-ton
"Happy Fun Ball," but I suspect that a re-designed patrol cruiser (which
needs a catchy nickname) would be useful to more referees.

     Pan-Imperia Claims Trademark Infringement, Salutes Fellow Builders

(Hazan, CORE) Representatives of Pan-Imperia Shipyards and Servicing\'s legal
department filed suit today via fast courier with the Imperial Ministries of
Justice
and Economic Benevolence against ISBA member Custom Built Wreckage
on the charges of trademark infringement. Company attorney Arthur 
Langheinrich: "In a recent statement, spokesmen for Custom Built Wreckage
repeatedly referred to the ISBA as a \'Pan-Imperial\' organization. Surely, a
member of an Imperial body has the legal resources to do a simple 
registration check. ValuJump Lines duly and legally registered "Pan-Imperia",
"Pan-Imperial", and "Pan-Imp" as legal trademarks of its subsidiary Pan-
Imperia Shipyards and Servicing. Whether this event was an intentional 
infringement of PISS\'s trademarks or whether it occurred through the
slack efforts of a lax legel department, ValuJump has no recourse but to
file suit to guard its trademarks. We all remember the unhappy tale of StellR 
Industries failing to aggressively pursue common use of its trademarked 
name for its reactionless drive system and thus having "Thruster" go out of
trademark and into common parlance. Pan-Imperia and ValuJump are 
determined not to allow that to happen to them.

Langheinrich went on to congratulate YugoShips PLC and Generica for 
their stand against the ISBA: "It takes a lot of courage to stand up for what
is fair and right as these companies have done. Shady dealings and veiled
threats go hand in hand with blatant disregard for intellectual property in this
new organization. We applaud these two companies and feel that if the 
current discussions among the United Freight and Passenger Workers 
Union regarding a general strike should unfortunately come to pass, that
there businesses would very likely see little effect due to their enlightened
managerial attitudes toward their workers."

GNN attempted to contact Custom Built Wreckage president  Grabow Freem
for comment, but was informed that he was suffering from a stomach flu and
was indisposed.

<< The show is just incredible.  Things planted in one season are

B5 is totally different to any other SF series. Characters evolve, and 
our perceptions of them change. Like you said, G\'Kar started off 
(apparently) as the villain, and Londo as comic relief. Then we find 
that, well, the Narn are pretty much justified in their actions, because 
they were badly treated by the Centauri. We now see the villains as 
heroes and the victims as getting what they deserve. Then it goes 
further: Londo signs a pact with the devil, but starts to regret it, 
while G\'Kar turns into more of a religious figure. Meanwhile, similar 
things are happening with other characters: are the angelic Vorlon 
really the good guys? maybe the Shadows are actually justified.

In general, episodes of, say, TNG can be viewed in any order. Very 
little changes. Everything is sorted out neatly at the end of 45 
minutes, and actions have no long term consequences. Not with B5. Quite 
often, the good guys *don\'t* win; the doctor *doesn\'t* save the dying 
child; a character injured or thrown in jail one week isn\'t back to 
normal in the next episode. 

You really have to consider B5 as a whole, not as individual episodes.

ASASA to commence starship production.

Aelfgyva Small Arms SA, the award winning munitions and general engineering
corporation, are proud to announce the formation of their starship
construction division following the successful acquisition of Far Horizons
Shipbuilding Ltd and Cygnus Jump Systems Pty.

The combined operation, trading under the ASASA banner, offers a complete
starship and small craft solution to all your requirements from design to
first flight.  All components and systems from the smallest to the largest
are sourced from within ASASA, ensuring that the high quality and attention
to detail for which ASASA, Far Horizons and Cygnus are renowned will be
maintained and enhanced.

ASASA\'s owner and Chairman, Sir Kohn Tarkosz, stated "Whilst plans have been
in place for a shipbuilding division for some time now, it was necessary to
wait until we could find partners with the same commitment to total quality
that has always characterised Aelfgyva Small Arms.  Happily, Cygnus and Far
Horizons are two such companies, and I am sure that together we will be a
major producer of vessels for customers both within and without the
Imperium."

As part of ASASA\'s commitment to quality and customer care an application
has been submitted for full membership in the recently formed Imperial Ship
Builders Association.  In view of ASASA\'s position as one of the Imperium\'s
premier corporations the granting of membership is expected to be a
formality and should be announced within the next day. 

Sir Kohn also stated that "Given the stated goals of the ISBA and the sheer
quality of the prestigious corporations that have announced their membership
in the past few days, I believe that soon being part of this organisation
will be a prerequisite for any shipbuilding company that wishes to be taken
seriously in the modern interstellar marketplace."

ASASA wishes to assure current customers of Far Horizons and Cygnus that all
extant contracts and quotations will be honoured for a minimum of one year.

	While the role-playing on the list is a good idea, I don\'t
think those who participate in it have any idea of how many people
are on the Traveller list - and consequently, how many people might
not care for their own little PBEM...  I found the whole thing
somewhat interesting (But I have to say that I\'m in no way associated
with YugoShips PLC!!!) I\'d be much happier if the whole thing was
moved to another list and the discussion archived on someone\'s web
site.
 
	While more interesting that the totally off-topic \'internet
hike\' (who is even less interesting to non-US folks), it does tend to
eat bandwith and hide other stuff...
 
	That\'s my (old-timer\'s) opinion. :)

it\'s being added at the request of some of us who are:

a> on several mailing lists, and

b> finding it difficult to track what\'s from the TML by subject line.

Indeed, the posts I\'ve been getting of of the TML almost had me running them
through Spam Hater 1.0, the looked like real commercial headers!

It\'s an experiment at the moment, I guess Rob is taking votes on the subject.

That\'s a lot to put into that little space, don\'t you think (whatever goes
there has to fit on less than half a line)?
How about:
	## Maneuver (HEPlaR, ## Mw, ## G-hours)

> I use 30 minute turns, so a 2G HEPlaR drive with 10 hours of fuel ...

Since different combat systems use different turn lengths, it\'s probably
best to put the number of hours into the USP.  Figuring G-turns wouldn\'t be
much trouble.  By putting the number of G-hours in the listing, it\'s easy to
figure out the number of G-turns and hours at maximum G.

                      Shugli, Tadashi, Slander, Sausagehead>


  In prepared remarks today, Generica Shipyards owner Joe Shugli called
the President of Arcadia Shipyards, Kodai Tadashi, a "overeducated
sausagehead with a weak grasp on reality."  When asked to clarify his
statement, Shugli told reporters to "Get a brain, already, you sycophantic
toadies of the information jump-lanes."  Generica spokes-sophont, Martin
97601, later explained that what Mr. Shugli meant to say was that Mr.
Tadashi had made a number of errors in his recent interview, and that Mr.
Shugli mearly wanted to inform Mr. Tadashi that he was incorrect.  Mr.
97601 then supplied the following response to Tadashi\'s press release.
  

> Several members of the press were quick to ask Mr. Tadashi for his reaction

  "If that sausagehead had spent five seconds doing a bit of research,
he\'d have realized that I\'ve never call the ISBA anything but a bunch of
overeducated equation pushers who wouldn\'t know a profitable starship if
they crammed it up their...hey, is this thing on?  Anyway, where was I? 
Oh yeah, the sausagehead.  I just hope he realises that I asked the union
boys to organize my shops a few years back - my workers kicked them out as
soon as they found out they\'d have to take a pay cut, plus pay dues.  I
pay the highest wages in the industry, bar none.  Nothing but
professionals working here, and they can join that narf-polishing union
any day of the week, as far as I\'m concerned.  As for monopoly, hah - I\'ve
undersold the best, and I\'ll undersell that sausagehead and all his
buddies till the morkvarts come home." 
  "As for causing trouble, well, that sausagehead doesn\'t know the meaning
of the word yet - probably can\'t spell it either."

  "Sure they cost \'about the same\' - if you\'re grasp of the word \'about\'
is poor.  What old sausagehead won\'t tell you is the maintenance cost on
one of his jobs.  Plus, just try getting parts for one of those custom
subsystems of his on some border world."

  "Second-rate, my grandma\'s patooty!  You ask any flyboy what he\'d rather

standards, or some wacky custom Acadia job with the inspection papers
still wet from the test pilot\'s bodily fluids.  They\'ll take a Generica

stay that way."



********Roleplay Mode Off***********

  Ah, what fun to get into the head of a crusty guy and mouth off - this
ISBA thing is turning out to be a great invention.  I\'m really getting a
chance to learn the QSDS system by looking at other people\'s designs and
trying to figure them out, plus all the recent posts are filled with
little in-jokes about Traveller history and culture.

  It\'ll be intersting to see if this develops into a fun PBEM - hope it
does.  Once M0 comes out I\'ll have to figure out a location for Generica
and do some desgin work on facilities and personalities.

  By the way, I think the idea of everything coming from one company\'s
catalog as an explanation for QSDS and SSDS is a bit restrictive.  I
prefer the idea that there are certain pre-approved designs (my concept
of Sylea Industry Norm - sort of like DIN or other industry agreements)
that are cheaper because they are pre-certified.  For example, in the
United States there is one kind of wall socket for 120 Volt AC power.
There is no government regulation of that socket, and lots of companies
make them - it\'s just that everybody agreed years ago on one design,
and that\'s now the de-facto standard.

> Subject: [TML] Recalculated CDB-1/THUDDD update

I think there are a couple of mistakes in the (revised) financial analysis
of the CDB-1:

 1 Underestimation of operating expenses.  The monthly life-support was
   updated from 20,600 to 41,200; but the total monthly costs were not
   updated and should be 353 KCr (instead of 332.4KCr).

      Monthly Payment:       290.0 KCr
      Monthly Salaries:       16.0 KCr
      Monthly Life Support:   41.2 KCr
      Monthly Maintenance:     5.8 KCr
      TOTAL                  353.0 KCr/month

   Plus, if the ship cannot scoop fuel:
      80std fuel/month         8.0 KCr/month (unrefined)
      80std fuel/month        40.0 KCr/month (refined)

 2 Overestimation of monthly income.  The cargo numbers were changed from
   304KCr (76 tons @ 4KCr) to 142KCr (71 tons @ 2KCr!?) and then multiplied
   by two to yield 466KCr.  I think the mistake here is that the cargo was
   multiplied twice, and should be 71KCr (71 tons @ 1KCr), yielding a
   corrected value of: 324 KCr.

      Biweekly Cargo:            71.0 KCr
      Biweekly Mail:             25.0 KCr (but see note below)
      Biweekly High Passengers:  60.0 KCr
      Biweekly Low Passengers:    6.0 KCr
      TOTAL                     162.0 KCr/2weeks -> 324 KCr/month

This gives a NET LOSS of 29 KCr per month (and even worse without the mail)!
So this ship is NOT PROFITABLE without speculation or more trips per month.

A NOTE ON MAIL:

According to T4 (pg97), mail delivery contracts may be available to
_subsidised_ merchants (600std hulls or larger) - so I would argue that the
Imperium would not entrust mail delivery to a 200std ship, except under
special circumstances, so this should not be part of the financials.

So the five requirements for a mail contract are (all from T4 pg 97):
   1  hull must be 600std or larger (to qualify for #2)
   2  government-subsidized merchant
   3  dedicated mail area (exactly 5std)
   4  ship is armed;
   5  gunner in crew;

QSDS v. 1.5 and build the Famille Spofulam CDB-1 (originally designed in
SSDS) in QSDS terms.  I got fairly close in most areas, and even wound up
with a slightly cheaper ship (62.97 MCr vs. 69.6 for the CDC-1) that
carried 2.6 tons more cargo that had the same number of staterooms and
other equipment. 

  The one main difference I found using QSDS is that I needed a lot more
power.  The hull (200T Disk (S)) requires 54.6Mw, and the thrusters
(factor 4) 56.0Mw, for a total of 110.6Mw for those components alone under
QSDS.  When I added sensors, controls, and a comparable laser, the power
needs went up to about 156Mw, essentially twice the 75Mw power supply that
is shown for the CDB-1.  

  I\'m curious why this might be - are there some power tricks you can do
with SSDS that you can\'t do with QSDS, or are QSDS components of a lower
tech level and so use more power (the CDB-1 is a TL-12 design)?

I don\'t pretend to know a lot about this kind of thing either, but I
know that you can compress hydrogen into a solid metallic crystal, with
relatively high density (~1 g/cm^3). Doing so requires quite a bit of
energy, but once metalized, it does not require power to keep it
crystaline. It does require A LOT of pressure though, and it needs to be
kept very cold. This stuff has already been made with today\'s
technology; it will become much easier to make if a practical
application for it can be found.

The details for metallic hydrogen were worked out by a solid state
physicist at LSU for Harold Williams\'s Traveller campaign back in 1987.
(Are you still on the list, Harold?) Sorry I can\'t be quantitative, but
here is a qualitative description based on my memory.

Fuel volume is reduced to a negligible amount; starships can jump all
they want provided they buy enough of this stuff. The mass increase of
the hydrogen due to the repulsive energy between the atoms in the
crystal lattice is a notable percentage of the fuel mass (~1%?). This
means that loss of cryonics or pressure around several tons of fuel
results in mass-energy conversions of nuclear proportions. Translation:
a fuel leak = a LARGE nuclear explosion. The crystal structure is fairly
stable at low temperatures and high pressures though, so fuel leaks
should be rare. Ships carrying metallic hydrogen were not allowed into
starports in Harold\'s campaign.

So how did this stuff affect my campaign? Not at all. I ruled that the
volume formulae for jump-drive performance were first order
approximations for mass formulae. So you get no advantage for reducing
hydrogen volume (whether it be by metalizing it or by storing it in
ammonia) in my campaign. Volume formulae never made sense to me
as anything but mass-formula approximations. YMMV.

I\'ll try to dig up some references. In the mean time, I hope this helps.

To day ISBA stopped taking membership applications. 

Josphanoer Cailfor the project coordinator for the ISBA stated, 
"Due to the high rate of response and some technical problems 
experienced with vast distance communications that the taking of 
membership applications have been temporally halted"

"This is just a temporary stoppage we believe that service to the 
industry comes first and that the problems mentioned above can cause 
bad service and delays, so until some problems no more memberships 
can be accepted."

"Yes we realize this can be inconvince to other ship yards who have 
yet to have a chance to respond to the announcement, and we do 
apologize."

******Role Play off*****

First I want to say I am thrilled with the high response from all of 
you thank you.


Look I have been recording an average of 5 new  members a day and have 
only had a chance to send one letter out to the original nine.  Of 
those only 3 have sent something back.  So until I get myself  organized 
I have to slow things down.  

Now as far as the TML and role playing I taken two steps to less the 
traffic.  First is I suggest that any PBEM come through my address.  
Though if an individual as a universal statement then I am not going 
to stop them.  Second once things are done I will have a 
PR/Publications division to handle all ISBA general announcements 
and to handle the important TML postings.  I can understand the 
wishes of those who don\'t want 30,000 ISBA postings on their TML, that\'s 
why I will offer a subscription of some sort to those who want to 
here more.

As you can see I have big plans so if  you will just give me some 
time to work out some email problems I ll. get things rolling

    'body' => 'INTERNET PRE-ORDER PLAN:

IG has heard the complaints about the Internet Mail Order program, and we
would like to propose some changes that will help both you the consumer and
us, the company.

At the beginning, the previous IG management was in charge of the internet
mail order service and unfortunately they botched it up and for both you
and us.  We took charge, and we ended up fixing the problems that existed.
However, now many of you are still making comments that there are still
problems with the internet, shipping costs are too high, and overall the
cost of books are too high.  Well, after a lot of consideration and much
number crunching we think that we have come up with a solution that will
make you happy and will bring the internet business back to life.

You see, in a perfect world, you should be able to get a product over the
internet from IG for a discounted rate (including shipping and handling),
the product should arrive in tip top shape, and you should be able to
receive the product before it ever hits the stores.  Well, if your willing
to give us (the new management a shot) then we will show you that it can in
fact be done this way.

We would like to propose a 1997 early auto buy program.  By this we mean a
program where you sign up to receive the next six releases from IG in
advance so we know that when a product is ready to ship, we automatically
ship it to you.  This is our advantage for doing this because we will know
in advance to some extent what our print runs should be.  On your side, you
will receive the products within three days of our receiving the product in
our warehouse if your located in the US.  The product will be shipped in a
durable protective cardboard box, that\'s right no more envelopes, no more
handwritten labels.  You will only be charged for your product once it has
shipped, so even though we have your pre-order on record, you will only be
charged as a product becomes available, again this is just helping us
project print runs, and we will insure that this is the way its handled.
Finally, you will receive a regular $22.95 product for $20.00 which is a
savings of $2.95 per product.

NOW FOR THE BEST THING, WE WILL NOT CHARGE ANY SHIPPING AND HANDLING FOR
THESE PRODUCTS FOR US OR CANADIAN CUSTOMERS.  FOR FOREIGN CUSTOMERS WE WILL
LOWER THE SHIPPING & HANDLING COST TO $5/product and if you make a bulk
order (i.e. several products at once) we will be able to do a better deal
on the S/H.  So, $20 is all you end up paying.  On a lower priced product,
like an adventure, you will receive a similar discount.  

With this new program, you will receive the new Traveller products before
anyone else, you will receive it in great condition, you will receive it
for less than you would pay in the store, you will only be charged once the
product is sent, and you will not have to pay any additional shipping and
handling - A pretty good deal which is fair to all parties concerned.  

We would appreciate it if you would give us your comments and let us know
if this type of arrangement will be of interest to you.  This would make
our lives easier, it would help us bring more good Traveller products to
you because we could better control our print runs and expenses thereby
being able to provide a higher quality product because funds can be better
appropriated.  So, please let us know your thoughts on this matter.  On a
final note, please keep in mind that this type of program will only work if
we get a lot of participation from you the consumer.  It will not make a
difference to have only a couple of people be interested as this will not
have very much affect on our making print quantity decisions.  We really
need participation from the consumer which is why we have created a win/win
situation for both of us.

Several people on the TML subscribe to other lists.  Many of these lists
include a subject tag so that people can easily tell what a mail message
is about, or what list it is from.  They do this freqently for filter
programs.  If you see a message that starts its subject with [TML] then
you know it is mailing list and you can process it accordingly.

Last week, I said that I would put the tag in over the weekend, then
conduct a poll of the list (send a message to me with the subject of either

VOTE: YES   or   VOTE: NO

Then on Thursday at 12pm EST, I will tally the vote and either leave it,
or remove it.  A YES vote means you want the [TML] tag, a NO vote means
can it.

In my campaign J-space is a non-spatial dimension, so any volume for the
ship has to created first. Most of the jump fuel goes into \'inflating\' an
N-space envelope for the ship to occupy. This also explains why jump drives
are rated by volume instead of mass.

my final design to Roderick\'s sample Famille Spofulam design, when I came 
across a descrepancy.

That design had a crew of four - a pilot, a navigator, an engineer, and a 
gunner/ steward. However, in the SSDS design sequence, Step 12, page 74 of 
Starships, it states that regardless of the reults, "ships up to 200 Td can 
be run by two persons" (although I would guess a steward/gunner would be 
extra).

Since this is my first use of SSDS ever, I immediately suspect that I\'m 
doing somewthing wrong, not Roderick, or that someone changed SSDS behind 
my back.

Any clarification?


By the way, what are the criteria used for judging these designs, if there 
will be any at all. This ship, the T\'o\'k Free Trade by \'Tihkeer\'reexkaap 
Industries, was designed by trying to imagine how the K\'kree would design a 
human free trader. As a result, there are some rather "questionable" design 
choices made.

This process sounds dimly akin to the conclusion of James Blish\'s "The

News Item, SYlean Shipping News, Year 0 Day 45:

"Famille Spofulam releases second Far Trader design

        Today, FSY released their second attempt at a mass-market trader,
after their first effort, the CDB-1, proved to be something of a flop;
while certainly a capable vessel, it nonetheless was impossible to operate
at anywhere near breakeven when carrying freight at standard Imperial
rates.

        It\'s successor, the CDB-2, bears some resemblance to its
predecessor, in that it is built into a 200 Td streamlined 4 X 29.8 m disc
hull.  There, however, the resemblance ends.  The hull material is
crystaliron; the computer-linked controls are best described as
bargain-basement level.  The ship comes unarmed, although an empty socket
is provided for retrofitting a light laser, and wilderness refuelling
capability has been sacrificed in the name of cargo capacity.

        Interior layout too is different; the bridge has been replaced with
a cockpit, and the lounge has been reduced in size to 5 tons.  Gone are the
large passenger staterooms and low berths of the CDB-1; in their place are
a dozen small staterooms for middle passengers.  All staterooms, both
passenger and crew, are located along the rim of the hull down two curving
corridors and enjoy floor-to-ceiling panoramic ports.  The lounge is
located directly aft of the cockpit, and engineering lies aft of the
lounge.  The rest of the vessel is tankage and cargo space (105 tons of
it), with cargo doors opening aft.  However, its price tag sets a record
low for an FSY vessel at 53.8 Mcr, and it reportedly will be able to earn a
living without speculative trading.

        This development will probably ease tensions at FSY HQ; there was
reportedly some concern at grand-parent levels of management about the
success of FSY\'s planned entry into the low end of the market..."

Although I tend to agree with Joe on the ISBA posts (that is that they are
great adventure fodder), I must admit I haven\'t been reading all of them.  I
haven\'t had the time to keep up with all of the posts.  

Too, though, I can see Colin\'s point, and with that in mind, if the general
consensus (or list mgmt, however this works) is that the ISBA stuff is
inappropriate to the TML, I will check into setting up a ISBA list for the
posting of this stuff.  

I will also use that list as the major THUDDD contest area and only post the
final results to the TML (along with the URL to get to the complete listing).

The question was asked (I forget by who, sorry! :)) how much energy was
generated by fusing 10 dT of LHyd to make a J1 in a 100dT starship.  Well
here is my back of the envelope estimate: (skip to the end if maths gives
you a headache!)

10dT = 135 kl = 9.45 tons = 9.45 Mg of Hydrogen = 9.45 million moles
(Going by MT numbers and 1 ton is 1000kg).

Fusing 4 atoms of hydrogen to 1 atom of helium releases about 25 MeV = 4 pJ
of energy.

Thus fusing 9.45 million moles of Hydrogen = 6 x 10^30 atoms releases about
2x10^19 J.

Answer: Fusing 10 dT of hydrogen releases about 20,000,000 TJ of energy.

If all of this jump fuel is used up in the 20 minutes before jump then the
jump drive is producing some 20,000 TW.  That\'s right 20 million GW coming
out of your typical Type S scout.  Even if you reduce this for a supposed
0.01% efficiency (a guess) this is an enormous amount of power.

So what is the jump fuel used for?  Cooling?

In MT the jump drive has a separate power plant for fusing the jump fuel.
Therefore it seems logical that the power plant is incredibly inefficent
and uses some of the LHyd as cooling because the radiators won\'t be
designed to handle this sort of power loading. The reason a separate power
plant is used is because the normal ship power plant would take weeks to
charge the jump grid (if it could do it at all).  The reason you wouldn\'t
use the power for anything else (like say a weapon) is that it would be a
one shot wonder because the jump power plant is designed to use LARGE
amounts of fuel (tons!) INEFFICENTLY and QUICKLY.

Any ideas how to explain CT and T4 jump drives which (I gather) use the
normal power plant to power the jump grid?

So when you see that type S scout you\'re chasing venting 500 kg of hydrogen
to space every minute (which is the only useful way using that much LHyd
for cooling will work) you\'ll know its going to jump soon and probably only
one parsec (given you detect all the gas vented).

Which brings up another interesting point - how long can a jump grid remain
\'charged\' before jumping (minutes, hours, days)?

We return now to our regularly scheduled press release...

Good point Mused, but I don\'t read the END pool rules as apply to 
fire combat.  This is the same rule that was used in CT (or a version 
of it) for hand to hand combat only.

Look at the examples given for the rule.  They are all melee combat 
attack routines.

This, added with the earlier CT rule for melee, convinces me that 
this rule was meant to be used for HTH combat only.

Yes, same here.  No self respecting GM would allow this.  I just 
don\'t like the idea that it is possible.

In my games, I give my players a lot of say so in what goes on.  
Although I reserve and frequently invoke final arbitration, my 
players feel better when they can have a say in rulings.  We discuss 
things that don\'t seem to make sense, and this gives them an 
opportunity to state their views on a particular subject.

From one of these rule discussions came the debate over the "First 
Blood" rule, and the result, as you have seen in my previous post, 
was to only allow critical hits for spectacular success.

Although I do like what you\'ve said about the first hit, I haven\'t 
heard enough to sway me.  I still like our interpretation and 
modification better.  

But, hey, name a GM who plays strickly by the book.

 
> I don\'t think PC dying quickly is the big problem in Traveller combat,
> indeed, as we proved on rec.games.frp.misc, it\'s damn hard to kill anybody.

You haven\'t been playing in my games.  The PCs just got through 
defending a space station against close to 1000 (yes, that\'s right) 
aliens used as a spearhead by the Zhodani (this is a prelude to the 
Fifth Frontier War.  The stations contains valuable information on 
lanthanum sites in a strategic subsector for the invasion).

The only thing I gave them was six Imperial Marine NPC\'s and terrain 
advantage (they were in the station and the invading aliens had to 
use their explosives to burst their way in).

But, I\'ve got some incredibly creative players, and eventhough I play 
a very realistic game and do not play favorites with regard to saving 
PC lives, all of the PC\'s made it out alive.  Five of the six Marines 
were killed, but the players were playing them and were crafty with 
them.

During this combat it was evident to me that, even with my rules 
modification, Traveller combat is very dangerous.  Much more than, 
say, D&D, where you can sustain multiple hits because of a large 
amount of hit points.

I don\'t think Traveller is a "heroic" system at all.  D&D is a heroic 
system, as it should be, but Traveller has always kept one foot in 
the realm of realism.

I think that the hit point and damage system in Traveller reflects 
this (although not exactly).

See, I wouldn\'t be this easy on this in my game.  If a PC wanted to 
shoot the gun out of somebody\'s hand--no easy task--I would apply a 
called shot at the appropriate modifier.  I couldn\'t see awarding it 
just because a SS was rolled.

At the same time, my players like the bonus achieved with rolling a 
SS--the critical hit.  There\'s that extra thrill you get when you 
know you\'ve probably just killed your target.  My rule change 
provides that--very similiar to the double damage awarded in D&D 
when a natural 20 is rolled.

I can see that you do play much more "heroic" than I do.  You are 
running Star Wars while I\'m running Aliens.

I am refering to the first hit rule, but I am not increasing damage.  
The rule, as is, is deadly enough.  

Let\'s take a joe-average character with STR 7, DEX 7, and END 7.

This character gets hit, and with the first hit rule, there is a 
strong chance that he will be rendered unconscious by that first shot 
even with the 3 dice maxium.  3 D6 would average 10 or 11 points of 
damage, and there is a good chance that the character would have two 
attributes go to 0 rendering him with a very serious wound.

Even if the character is not dead (which would be impossible given 
the stats and the example I cited), he is effectively out of the 
combat and may be at the mercy of the enemy since he is unconscious.

Under my system, this is not likely to occurr, and the PC has a much 
better chance of living to fight another day.

They are on Peter Miller\'s web site.  If you have trouble getting 
them, then let me know.

Take the total *annual* operating costs of a design (assuming 25
jumps per year) and divided it by the maximum total possible
annual income the ship can generate (again assuming 25 jumps per
year). This will then give you a percentage Required Breakeven
Occupancy i.e. how full the ship must be over a year to breakeven.

X-TEK Industries, LIC
Spokesperson: Count Commander "X" (Real name is unknown/classified)

Company Statement:
X-TEK is a weapons, aerospace, and electronics firm.  Mainly a military
contractor, but some civilian equipment is produced by our
subsidiaries.  Our specialties include starship weapon systems, sensors
and optics, and propulsion.  It is natural that X-TEK would produce
ships, and therefore become a founding member of the ISBA.
Think of X-TEK as being like "Mackdounall Doughlass" or "LokHied Marton"
of ancient solomani history, but producing modern TL-12 equipment.

Subsidiaries:
"Noble Image" Pesonal Electronics
"X-TEK Central"  Vehicles and novelties
"Spy\'s R Us"  X-TEK\'s very own civilian "spy" shop.

Mission Statement:
Our goals are to produce the best military/paramilitary starships in the
Imperium.  As we now have secured this great imperium, we must now guard
our investmnet wisely.  The Imperium still has enemies, and as our
scouts come back frombeyond the imperial rim, no doubt there will be
other "pocket" imperiums out there who have hostile ntent, or would dare
to steal our imperium from us.  X-TEK believes in honor, duty, and
vigalance, so that our great Imperium can grow and flourish for our
children, and beyond.

        Hm... beats me.  I\'ve never messed around with the QSDS.  Also,
IIRC, the CDB-1 was overpowered by a few Mw.  I guess the standard
components are somewhat less expensive.  What I\'d love to know is how it
came out with more cargo space despite using QSDS.  Did you put the lounge
in?

        Nope, it\'s me.  I put in excess crew for three reasons: 1)
security, 2) redundancy, and 3) gotta have crew slots for a decent-sized

- - Geonee worlds of the Rebellion-era
- - Geonee TNE pocket empire.

I know, the page will probably look kinda bland, so if anyone has any
online artwork pertaining to the Geonee, please email me where to get it.
 Just remember that this is Carlos\' work, so I\'m going to run it by him
first before including it.

(Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain!)

I just had a very interesting thought.

What exactly to the prices of staships and thier compnets for anyway?  Whats 
the wolesale/retail values of these things.  In other words, what is the 
bottom line?

If we are going to go on with this ISBA thing and Buisness profiles, we need 
to know how much money the companies are raking in.  This will help to 
determine just how many ships such a corp can build and how to budget 
efectively and still make a profit.
(and you thought Free Traders had it rough, try running a Multi-Gigacredit 
Corporation!)

So far for my campain I am asuming all prices to be standard retail values. 
 50% is actual cost of the ship, what the company put into it and the other 
50% is profit.  That way the corp gets back double what it put into it. 
 Corps do not usualy finance, that the banks perogative.  The bank buys the 
ship from the corp. (Hmm...First X-TEK Financial....sounds lucrative! 
Cha-CHING!)

This of course will be one of the topics to be discused at the ISBA meeting.

This is a suggestion to Mr. Tim Reynolds re: that meeting.
May I suggest doing IRC, with email to people who for some reason cannot 
logon to IG\'s server.  We could use #ISBA.  I would suggest it 2 weeks after 
my SSDS class, same time 8pm EST.  That would make it March 1st (60-0000). 
 The Commnader is going to a simulation conference on Jax(Distant world on 
the Imperial Fringe) the next weekend Feb 21-22-23.  (<52-54>-0000).

Just a few tings to thing about.  And with that I leave you for now.  Play 
nice!  Remember Big bro...The Commander is watching you! :-)

acquired ship construction facilities  (ED: ref. "Does McCoy have what it
takes to play with the big boys?" 01-35-0003, and "McCoy rapes Lectronica
Shipyards" 01-55-0003, and "McCoy named Tycoon of the Year" 01-365-0003).
The Post-Dispatch has gotten permission for a series of in-depth interviews
with the mysterious and reclusive tycoon, which will be running in the next
few weeks.

McCoy announced that he was "firing up his Atari 52Million" and "putting his
head to the grindstone" in order to produce the ISBN competiont Far Trader
and Mercenary Cruiser designs.  "These designs are far behind the curve of
what the public wants" Stated McCoy, "But the publicity we will get when we
win will allow our REAl ships, such as the BXF-23 Safari Ship and the
800-ton SRC-5a System Reinforcement Cruiser, to get more Imperial attention"

Lectronica Shipyards has long been a player in the ready-made component
starship market, but fell into financial difficulty with their disasterous
"SCS-300" Scout-Courier design, which failed even the most cursory Imperial
Design Bureau scrutiny.  They were "absorbed" into the McCoy Mercantile
Empire, and all financial analysts fully expected tht thte shipyards, which
occupy a large area of prime industrial property in the Sylea system, would
be dismembered and sold piecemeal.  The announcement by McCoy that the
shipyards would be continuing in operation sent the Sylea 400 stuttering,
first losing 15 points, then gaining 25. Vurst Sigggarthu, Manager of Chase,
Manhatten Finacial Corp, stated that ">this departure from the norm had
confused and startled everyone".

Further information regarding this mysterious Tycoon, his strange behaviour,
and the new ship designs he apparently plans to produce, can be had in
future Editions of the Post-Dispatch.

the great importance they place on technology. So, when creating Geonee

technical career and/or attending technical studies. So, I created The

the high gravity of their homeworld gave them higher strength, but their
complexity made them less resistant (in comparison with other humans).
        Comments Welcome!

===============================================================================
Creating Geonee Characters
==========================

	The Geonee are humans, so the basic procedure in the T4 rulebook
applies with some minor modifications.

	Primary Characteristics: Roll and assign 2D6 to each of the six primary
characteristics by any of the three methods detailed in the main rulebook. Then,
compute the characteristics in the following way:

	Strength: 2D+1			Intelligence: 2D
	Dexterity: 2D			Education: 2D
	Endurance: 2D-1		        Social Status: 2D

	Homeworld: Select a homeworld among the Geonee populated worlds
according to the specific setting desired.

	Advanced Education: In addition to the options presented in the T4
rulebook, one more choice is quite popular among Geonee: technical studies,
centered on practical use and development of technology. Technical srudies are
pursued in Technical Schools and Academies.

	Careers: In addition to the standard ones, a significant proportion of
adult Geonee choose to pursue a career as general-purpose technicians.

	Note: The Technical School adn the Technical Academy exist on many
non-Geonee worlds, and other characters may attend to them and/or pursue a
Technician career. But, on the Geonee culture, these institutions and the
technicial career are prominent.

	The Technical School: (4 years)
        ====================
	As an alternative to college, a character may try to acquire technical
skills attending to specific centers, commonly called "Technical Schools".
Instead of +4 Edu, a graduate from a technical school adds +1 to his
Education, +1 to his Dexterity and +1 to his Computer skill for the full term.

	Prerequisite: Dexterity 5+
	Admission: 5-; DM+1 if Dex 8+; DM+2 if Int 9+
	Failed admission: No age penalty.
	Perseverance: 7-; DM+1 if End 8+; DM+2 if Int 8+

		5  Technical
		6  Technical
	Graduation: Bachelor in Technical Studies (BTS)
	Honors: 9-; May apply for Technical Academy
		Benefit: +1 Edu

        The Technical Academy: (2 years)
        ======================
	Some individuals decide to pursue further studies in technical fields with
the aim or becoming researchers or specialized engineers. They do so in the
Technical Academies. Instead of +2 Edu, a graduate from a Technical Academy
adds +1 to his Education and +1 to his Computer skill for the full term.
	Characters may attend the Technical Academy only once.

	Prerequisite: Technical School Honors graduate
	Admission: 7-; DM+1 if Int 8+; DM+2 if Edu 8+
	Failed admission: No age penalty.
	Perseverance: 9-; DM+1 if End 8+; DM+2 if Int 8+

		5  Science
		6  Academic
	Graduation: Master in Technical Studies (MTS)
	Honors: 10-; Benefit: +1 Edu

        Technician Character Template:
        =============================
	Trained in technical skills and practical use of technology, technicians
can be found in many positions and fulfilling many roles, from mechanic
repairmen to starship engineers or computer programmers.
	Routine tasks: Machine operation, maintenance and repairing, technical
advisement, industrial research and development.

The ship design nominally requires a crew as Roderick designed, but since
canon has always stated that a Scout/courier could be run by one person,
and a 200T far or free trader could be run by a crew of two, the exception
is in there.

Of course, this is based on the ships running normally so that one person
could reasonably do the job of two...if your engineer has to stand by the
jumpdrive keeping the Whatchimifloozits lashed together  with the strap
from her spare bra, she\'s not going to be much use as a navigator, if
that\'s her other job!

Also, there are probably regulations in place in the Imperium regarding
crewing requirements for regularly scheduled passenger carriage or charter
ships; this can be ignored for the odd, informal charter arrangement

But the bottom line is: a 100 ton ship can be handled by one person, a 200
ton ship can be handled by two...the 100 ton ship, however can run OR
fight OR prepare for jump, but not all three.

Re: [TML] in the header, counting my vote the results are:

     For:     20
     Against: 21
     Abstain:  2

One of the abstains was originally a no, but this is only 40 of the 500
people on the list.  This isn\'t enough of a difference to create a mandate.
 I have removed the [TML], though my gut says to leave it.  The list
management isn\'t a democratic process, but I belive in getting your input
and making the most people the happiest.  The majority of the people
aparently don\'t care, which doesn\'t help with this decision.  The
difference between votes was 1/2 of 1 percent.  With that said, I may bring
this up later after the header goes away and the backlog clears up.  Maybe
more votes will be spawned to sway things on way or the other.

        Anybody else writing an adventure for the adventure writing contest?
I\'ve got a question for all you knowledgeable folks in relation to the one
I\'m doing: 
        Hypothetical situation: two ships are engaged in combat in a
planetary system.  Finally, one of the vessels receives enough damage that
they decide to withdraw and lick their wounds.  Now, within the context of
the T4 rules, is it possible for a ship to orient itself on a course
outsystem, then engage its jump drive for only a second or so, essentially
causing a "micro-jump" that will drop the ship out of jumpspace well outside
the system where it can make repairs.  Later, the ship can reorient on the
system and jump back in.
        Can this be done?  As near as I can tell there are no rules that say
this is impossible, and from what I\'ve read about the theory of jump drives,
it seems like it could work.  Are there any inherent limitations or risks to
this procedure that makes it impossible?  I would appreciate any help or
insight you guys can give.

In a bold announcement today, the Imperial Appropriations Committee in
conjunction with the Imperial Ship Builder\'s Association stated that they
would no longer require shipyards to use QuipTech equipment for Imperial
purchased starships.

This announcement came shortly after another announcement detailing the
record acceptance of the ISBA among shipbuilders.  Citing complaints about
monopolization and government kickbacks, the Imperial Bureaucracy decided in
against a lower body\'s decision that QuipTech be the sole supplier for
Imperial shipyards.

The desision announced that all equipment must be proven to meet the
standard norms displayed in both of QuipTech\'s standard catalogues, QSDS and
SSDS.  As expected, Director Savant was rather displeased with the decision.

"This is an outrage!!" was the only comment we were able to gather as
Director Savant was led from the meeting hall to his awaiting limo.  We have
been told to expect a press conference from QuipTech shortly.

THUDDD is a subsidiary of QuipTech and we have (hopefully) been granted an
honorary membership in the ISBA (that\'s what the press release said anyway).
In role-playing terms, THUDDD is the Marketing/Management subsidiary of
QuipTech that has been (or soon will be) contracted to run the Imperium\'s
(and eventually the ISBA\'s) ship design contest.  In real life, I hope to
work with tim closely and help see that the THUDDD/ISBA partnership can grow
side-by-side, but while he oversees the ISBA, I will run THUDDD and that\'s
as they say is that. :)

hands.  I hope to continue THUDDD as long as there are still ships left to
design.

jobs were shared;and this calls for a bridge via the design rules. Yet,
since any
200 dt ship is capable of being run by a crew of 2, would a bridge be required?

2) Similiarly, how many workstations are required for a ship with an
official crew
of 12 that can be run by 2 folks?

3) If we use the minimum crew of 2 or 3, assuming job swapping, how are crew 
salaries determined?

4) I don\'t remember ever seeing an explanation of what the disadvantages of the
lower TL controls are...(manybe this could solve #1 and #2: only at TL12 are the
controls automated enough to allow the minimum crew level...Two probs: what 
breakthrough is involved to explain it, and what does this do to canon and 
background if anything?)

5) Oh, and uh, yeah...when are these designs due? <g>

And I\'d just like to say DAMN it\'s hard to get anything economical under QSDS
that remotely resembles the ol\' favorite from CT.

	I\'m sorry, but you can\'t have a J-2 ship with TL-9 controls.  You 
can\'t have things installed on your ship that exceed the TL of your 
controls.  Why?  Can you imagine operating a PEMS or j-drive with 
low-tech mechanical controls? Of course not.  I don\'t know if this rule 
was ommitted from Q/SSDS, but it\'s in FF&S, on which both systems are based.

	The reason that you can\'t match the T4 design, as everyone should 
know by now, is that the ships in T4 weren\'t created with any design 
system, they were just made up out of thin air and then assigned prices.  
Sad as it may sound, many of IG\'s published ships are, from the point of 
view of the official design systems, "non-canon."

Because the subjects are harder to read WHEN sorted. Most internetters use

And in case you are wondering, after 14 votes, the following six ships are
in the lead...

1. & 2. Merc Cruiser & Patrol Cruiser (tie)
3. & 4. Free Trader & Yacht (tie)
5. & 6. Subsidized Merchant & Fighters (tie)

One last note, any questions specific to this month\'s THUDDD competition
(the Far Trader), send to Roderick, but any questions for THUDDD in general
or to me specifically, send to me :)

All jumps no matter what length takes about one week. You\'d definately
avoid the combat but you\'ll be in hyperspace for a week.

On another note: Can ones jump destination be the same as the origin? I
allow it and it has been used by clever players/pirates to get some heat
from patrol cruisers et c.

    'body' => 'We\'re going back to basics in my game.  First, some notes on that, 
followed by a question about shotguns.  

I\'m going to be adhereing more strictly to the basic rules in the T4 
main book eventhough I put a lot of time and effort into the House 
Rules that I posted a few months back.  These are on Peter Miller\'s 
web site if any of you want to add more detail to your Traveller 
game.

There are many reasons for this revision to the basic rules, but 
chief among these is the limited amount of time that I have for 
Traveller lately (hence my lack of involvement on this list).

Although my House Rules are a good set of additions for Traveller, 
and I stand by them, they were not play tested at the time I posted 
them.  I\'ve made some revisions, deletions, and additions to improve 
the speed of play.  

I have learned that maintaining an alternative rules set is a lot of 
work.  I wanted to just write them once and leave it, but I am forced 
to continually correct problems that occur in play and make additions 
for things that I had not thought of.

Another problem (well not really a problem) is that Traveller is a 
growing game.  We know have the basic rules, but more rules continue 
to come.  Things in the CSC, especially the vacuum damage rule, 
replaced my rule for the same thing.  

My players are carrying around two rules sets--mine and the T4 main 
book.  So, for all of these and many more reasons, I am reverting 
back to the T4 basic rules.  Sure, I\'m still going to fix what I 
think needs fixin\', but it should be a lot less work for me to 
provide occasional rules modifications rather than maintain a 
complete alternate rules version.

Besides, from what I\'ve seen of the Emperor\'s Arsenal, we\'re already 
in for some more detailed rules, and I like to keep as close as I can 
to the official rules.  It reduces the amount of GMwork required and 
keeps us feeling legitimate.

Still, I\'ve made a few changes to the rules listed in the main book.  
Not many, mind you--just some nicks and tucks here and there, and I 
thought that I would share them with you.  

And, here they are--listed by page number.  I welcome any comments.  
These rules are written towards my players, but it is easy to derive 
the benefit from them if they interest you.

Page 49 (Rule Change):  At the top of this chapter, I have marked the
formula for our task system.  It reads--	
 Target Number Calculation:  (Skill x 2) + (Attribute / 2)  round up

Page 50 (Rule Modification):  In the task difficulty box at the top of
the page, change the dice code for Staggering tasks to 4D, and, for
Impossible tasks, change the code to 5D.

Page 52 (Rule Clarification):  There are three systems for rolling
initiative given.  Although I may use one of the others from time to
time, the default system we are using is the Individual Initiative
system.  We will use this system as listed (and this is on my list for
a later rules modification), but I want to clarify how the Leadership
skill will be used in modifying the roll.

As we have already been playing it, the Leadership skill can only be
used to modify the initiative roll if the person determined to be in
command, or a leadership position, has the skill.  If there is a clear
leader in the situation, and he doesn\'t have the skill, then it cannot
be used to alter everyone\'s initiative Note that the Leadership
modifier does apply to everyone within the leader\'s command
radius--not just the leader\'s initiative roll.  This simulates group
coordination brought on by good, personal leadership skills.

If there is a clear leader, and he does have Leadership as a skill,
but another character has a higher Leadership skill, the actual
leader\'s skill must be used even if it is lower than another\'s even
though the rule book says that the highest Leadership score should be
used.  Of course, the character with the higher Leadership score could
"take command" as often happens in combat situations in which case the
new leader\'s skill level will be used.

Note that usually, for a leader to have command, he must be with the
group to be able to direct them.  There will be some situations, as
was the case in the movie Aliens, where technology (cameras and
radios) are used to allow a leader to command from a distance. 
Remember the lieutanant in the movie commanding the group from the
station in the APC, communicating through the console?  I will referee
this on a situation by situation basis.

Page 52 (Rules Modification):  At the top of the second column, it
states how far a character can move in a given combat round--15 meters
if walking and 30 meters if running.  I consider these general
guidelines for human movement, but sometimes it is necessary to know
exactly how far a character can move.  In order to determine this, I
have come up with a rule based on your character\'s physical stats. 
Whenever it is important to know exactly how far your character can
move in a round, just plug your character\'s current physical stats
into the equation below.
 Run distance in one round is:  (Str + Dex + End) x 1.5 meters    

 Trot distance in one round is:  2/3 Run distance.
 Walk distance in one round is:  1/2 Run distance.
 Crawl distance in one round is:  1/3 Run distance.

 drop fractions on all final calculations

Page 56 (Rule Modification):  The Autofire rules on page 56 say that
every target adjacent to the primary subject of a fully automatic
burst is subject to an attack.  Then the rules go on to say that the
referee decides which adjacent targets are attacked if there is
insufficient ammunition to attack them all.

This poses a problem if a character has a very high skill level and
target number because it is unrealistic to assume that a character can
fire a five round burst and put one bullet into each of a group of
five people standing together--no matter how skilled the character is.

To fix this, I am instituting a rule that puts limits on the number of
additional targets that can be attacked.  You should mark this in your
book on page 56.
 Burst Size			Additional Targets
 3 round burst		1 adjacent target
 4-5 round burst		2 adjacent targets
 6-9 round burst		3 adjacent targets
 10+ round bursts	4 adjacent targets

How close is adjacent?  Usually this will be within 1.5 meters of the
target, but the GM will assign different danger spaces in certain
circumstances.

Page 58 (Rule Modification):  In using the Multiple Action rule under
our modified task system, we run into some problems.  There is an easy
solution.  Simply divide the target number by the number of actions
you want your character to perform in the same round and drop
fractions.  When the target number drops below 1, no more actions can
be performed in the round.  For situations where the character is
trying to perform more than one type of task, rather than repeated use
of the same task (like brawling blows), use the lowest target number
for this calculation.

Page 60 (Rule Addition):  We will be using all of the optional rules
listed on page 60, but it is not clear how loss of End due to fatigue
is recovered.  So, I made a rule.  Chances are that this will not be
necessary to calculate in a game because it takes longer to recover
from fatigue than it does to fight in a session of combat.  But, just
in case we need it, here is the rule.
 Fatigue (End) recovery:
 Rest for 16 - End rounds to recover 1 point of End.

Page 105 (Rules Addition):  At the top of page 105, close to the
Additional Software table, make a note that there are computer
programming rules listed on page 21 of BJTAS #1 and in CT main rule
books.

Page 113 (Rule Addition):  On the Crew Salaries table at the bottom of
page 113, the steward\'s position has been omitted.  Add this to the
table--
 Position	Minimum Skill Level		Monthly Salary
 Steward	Steward-0			Cr3,000 

Page 115 (Rule Clarification):  At first glance, the Travel Formulae
is confusing.  In the box next to the formula, define the variables
like this--
 D = Km x 1,000		(convert kilometers to larger units)
 A = G x 10		(ship\'s G rating x 10)
 T = Seconds		(express time in seconds)

Here is another form of the same expression.  I\'ve written this at the
top of page 115, and it is helpful to use this version of the formulae
to find out how long it takes a ship to travel long distances.  Note
in this expression of the same formulae, the variables have changed to
represent different quantities.
 T = Square Root of (D / A / 32.4)

 where
 D = Km / 1,000		(convert to meters)
 A = G			(A is equal to the G rating of the ship)
 T = Hours			(express time in hours)



And now, I have a question.  How are you guys dealing with shotguns 
in the basic rules?  I haven\'t seen a provision for group hits like 
they\'ve done for autofire, so before I go converting old CT rules to 
T4, I\'m curious how all of you are handling it.

Thanks,

Kenneth.

An excellent point.
Although I have enjoyed reading this stuff, it does get on
the monotonous side if you\'re not involved.
And the chances are I won\'t get involved - unless these new
shipyards start up in the MT era......My Choice.

Could this be one last attempt at mass communication before
our \'Colonial Friends\' (no offence intended) have to start
paying for their local telephone calls ? Surely this would
be better suited to \'THUDDPBEMML\'..?
Then I wouldn\'t have to wait for 15 minutes to download a
load of stuff that goes directly to my Deleted tray!

Sorry if this is a little harsh, but maybe some others feel
the same way...

I have just one question...How did you possibly end up with a crew
requirement of <12> on a 200 dT ship???

Go back and re-read the crewing sections of QSDS and SSDS...I suspect
you\'re rounding up where you don\'t have to, and possibly before you have
to. Remember all crew final requirements are figured after the entire ship
is designed, that\'s when you add all those \'fractional\' crew numbers up.

I can\'t see more than 4 for a minimal 200dT trader: Pilot, Navigator,
Electronics, and Engineering.  Maybe throw in Gunnery and Steward if
you\'re anal about it. That gives you six, right below the \'Command crew\' 
level.

CAC/Tassini Reconsiders ISBA Membership

CAPITOL, SYLEA/CORE - Amid growing controversy concerning the purpose of
the newly formed Imperial Ship Builders\' Association (ISBA), Ce Acatl
Corporation (CAC) is considering resigning from the organization.  CAC,
which last week announced its acquisition of Tassini Yards, is a large
engineering services firm with approximately 350,000 employees on 4 Sylean
worlds. 

Though best known for design and consulting work on ground and orbital
transport systems, many industry analysts expect CAC to become a major
player in the small-starship industry through the acquisition of Tassini,
a small but highly regarded shipyard on Sylea.  As such, membership of
CAC/Tassini in the ISBA was seen as an important signal of commitment to
this industry.

However, the birth of the ISBA has not been tranquil.  Serious controversy
has erupted between members over business practices and labor relations,
and some unsubstantiated charges of industrial sabotage have been made
(see related stories, pages 15-17).  Arpidol Zilznik, the CEO of CAC, held
a press conference on 226/000, at which he remarked "We are interested in
working together with our industry colleagues to build better ships, not
in joining a rude debating society, nor a monopolistic antiunion trust." 
Zilznik went on to say that the CAC Board of Directors would be
"carefully reviewing" the question of continued ISBA membership over the
coming weeks.

In related news, anonymous reports from the Tassini test facility indicate
that flight tests of the prototype "Pochteca" Far Trader may begin as
early as next week.  If true, this would confirm earlier rumors that
Tassini had been working on the Far Trader design well before their
acquisition by CAC.

*** END ***

And now, back to out-of-character mode...

I\'m confused about how much leeway there is in crew requirements for small
starships.  By my calculations using strict QSDS rules, a typical 200-ton
Far Trader mounting a laser, a sandcaster, and improved avionics would
need at least 7 crewmembers:

  1 engineering
  1 electronics
  2 maneuver (pilot, astrogator)
  2 gunnery (laster, sand)
  1 command (for the 6 above)
 ----
  7

In addition to these, you\'ll need 1 medic to carry any passengers at all
(and this is enough for the crew/passengers of reasonable 200-ton
traders), plus at least one steward, two if you plan on carrying 7 or more
high passengers along with any mid-psgs at all, or 8 or more
hi-psgs with no mid-psgs.  With the medic and one or two stewards, we\'re
up to 9 or 10 crew.

Now, against this we have the statement that 2 people can operate a
200-ton ship, and the trend toward collapsing the 9 or 10 crew
positions into 4 or 5 actual people in most Far Trader designs.  Also,
while it\'s stated that you need a large stateroom for the commander
(captain/owner) and smalls for other folks, one frequently sees violations
of this (all smalls, double-bunking, and so forth).

So, my question is this:  For purposes of THUDD, we need to clarfiy this
rather murky area.  Or is it perhaps the case that part of THUDD
evaluation will be crew comfort and capability?  If I put 5 people crewing
a ship that needs 10 by the strict rules, what capabilities are lost or
diminished?  Will high passengers really ride on a ship where their
steward is also the gunner, half the engineering staff, and the
astrogator?

  I seem to recall that the stated minimum applies to "normal operations"
- - combat requires the number of crew that the calculations call for.  What
is unclear is if you need to do the calculations for how many crew,
install that many workstations, and then the small one or two person crew
has to move between the workstations to fly the ship, or if a 100T ship
only needs one workstation (or a 200T ship 2).

  By the way, I noticed that some of the very small TL12 power plants are
rated as using 0.0 crew.  I suppose one could reduce crew requirements by
using a whole bunch of these instead of one big power plant - I just get
the picture of a ship with a whole bunch of portable generators wired in
series.

The ships in T4 are all buildable at or very near cost by the Book 2
"Starships" design system. They are all very canonical, much more so
than QSDS (a T4 afterthought) or SSDS (a botched system in a botched
book) or even FFS (a shiboleth for a very small Traveller sub-clique).

The reason you can\'t match the T4 design is because these design systems
are apparently broken by T4 standards. It seems to me that a desirable
design system will be compatable with the Trav universe. I am still
waiting to see such a design system for T4.

While I wait, I continue to use High Guard, which is very good, but not
quite ideal. I have a system for converting from High Guard USP\'s to T4
USP\'s which seems to work pretty well with my homebrew combat system.
But the conversion system still has two snags in it. Does anyone here
know:
1) How do you get the T4 USP value for a meson screen?
2) How do you get the T4 USP value for a repulsor battery?

I\'ll post my conversion system here soon, along with a bunch of T4 ship
profiles featuring oldies classics like the (non-broken) type S scout
courier, type A free trader, Kinunir class battle cruiser and Lightning
class fleet intruder.

***********************************************************************
        Hm... beats me.  I\'ve never messed around with the QSDS.  Also,
IIRC, the CDB-1 was overpowered by a few Mw.  I guess the standard
components are somewhat less expensive.  What I\'d love to know is how it
came out with more cargo space despite using QSDS.  Did you put the lounge
in?
***********************************************************************

  I\'ll have to look at my notes, but I don\'t think I added a separate
lounge.  I\'ve always assumed, based on published Traveller deckplans, that
the space allocated to staterooms does not represent the room itself, but
the room, hallways, lounges, food prep areas, hot tubs, whatever.  Thus,
if I did see a reference to the lounge, I assumed it to be part of the
description, rather than a component that had to have tonnage allocated to
it.

  As for power usage, I assumed that the power plant was sized to do
everything at once - life support, thrust, fire the laser, and refine
fuel.  A more conservative design might have used a smaller power plant,
but for an adventurer\'s ship, I\'d like to be able to run, shoot, use the
sensors, and refine that last bit of fuel needed for jump, all at the same
time.

Not so! _Battlestar: Galactica_ was very much linear over the course of the
show (excluding the horrible revival _BG:1980_). Characters and villains
grew, their relationships changed, they matured, and even died.

Voyager is also doing similar (but not as intense) character growth and
relationship development.

Carlos, one of the first additions I plan to make to the Advanced Education
process is a 2 year Technical School.  As the rules are now, College is
more academic-oriented than hands-on technical.  I think we really need
some sort of Tech School that focuses just on technical skills.

Incidently, anyone know what TL did the 2nd Imperium get to before it collapsed?

Page 57 (Rule Modification):  About one third the way down the right

the character\'s physical stats.  We will continue to alter this rule
by only allowing this if the to hit throw against the character was a
spectacular success.  Otherwise, the first hit, like all hits, can be
placed against a character\'s stats in any way the player chooses as
long as actual points from one die are not broken up.  From here on
out, we will call this the Critical Hit rule since this type of hit
has a good chance of killing or neutralizing a character.

Well, first of all, while you can invoke cooling, the fact is
that it could, in fact, take that much energy to get into
jump space (you are, after all, trying to leave the universe).

As to efficiency, you could guess the lower limit by
figuring they would be willing to sacrifice more fuel
for a smaller, less eff., reactor as long as the output
of the less efficient reactor is significantly greater
(lets call a factor of 5 significant) than the output
of a more efficient reactor with a volume equal to the
volume of the less efficient reactor plus the extra
fuel.

Well, there is a reason I don\'t play GURPS... ;-)

Actually, in a 6 month campaign, I found that the following problems occured:

1) Players hated 1/2d
2) Crit fail was right but success chances were too high
3) after applying difficulty fix, chances were too huigh for both success
and crit-fail.
4) Tasks do not have any time components (even specificed times to atempt)
that I could find in the rules (Had this problem with TNE, too)
5) Stats became more imoportant than skill, and easier to acquire.

on a side note, I find the experience system to be annoying, inconsistent
with CGen, and not to my player-group\'s liking. THey also bitched loudly
about TNE\'s.

Just for reference, I don\'t like gurps because difficulties are expressed
soley as modifiers to target number, and all tasks are on 3d vs asset.

You can jump from a dead stop.  Your real-space course has nothin gto do
with your course through jump.

As for the micro jump, it\'s going to take 168 hours, more or less.  There is
no known way around that.  You could concievably set for a jump of zero
distance and just disappear for a week, returning to the exact spot you
left, with one week to repair everything inside your ship.

cargo, and how 1000Cr is not enough to make a free trader financially 
viable.

Well,it occured to me that our free trader designs are NOT just competing 
with each other, they are probably competing with 20000 ton bulk 
freighters, which probably have a much lower cost per ton of cargo ratio.

I\'f I\'m trying to ship some widgets from Sylea to some other plant, I\'m 
not going to pay more to have my cargo shipped via a far trader, I\'m 
going to go the cheapest route possible.

The same thing happens in modern day shipping. There is no way a small 20 
foot shipping boat could ever hope to make money shipping crude oil and 
competing with the giant oil tankers. There are probably similar 
economies of scale working in the trucking and rail industries.

I don\'t know if this is canon or not, but I would hereby suggest that most 
cargo shipping in the imperium is NOT by small 200 ton free or far 
traders. This forces anyone operating such a small vessel to either 
engage in speculative trading, or to try and get hired for "special" 
cargoes aka adventures!

Any thoughts? Would anyone like to try and devise a 5000 ton bulk 
freighter and determine if the cost per ton  of cargo is actually lower 
(I\'ll give it a try this weekend if no one else does).

Unless I misunderstood you, you ask 2 questions: 1. Is possible to enter 
jumpspace for "only a second or so" and 2. Is it possible to jump just 
outside the system in order to repair and jump back later. Short answers: 
1. No; 2. Yes.

According to canon, it is possible to jump "just outside the system". It 
is a "Jump-0" and takes as much fuel as a Jump-1 (10% of hull volume). 
However, Entering jumpspace *always* takes about 1 week (168 hours +/- 
10%, iirc). So, your hypothetical detour to lick them wounds would take 2 
weeks (jump out, jump in) and 20% of your ship\'s hull volume in fuel.

Today in an amazing statenment Josphanoer Cailfor the project coordinator
 for the ISBA,  sayed that ISBA is agian taking membership applications.  
He went on to state that the speed of ISBA techs at handling most
 of the problems shocked even the ISBA founders, and hopes to
 keep them on staff.  Also he said that the first Formal Dinner for 
the whole ISBA will be held shortly but refused to give a time or
 place do to security threats.  We hope to be reciving the RSVP very
 shortly for the Dinner / conferance.  If all goes well then the ISBA will no
 longer be an  association in name only.

***Role Playing off****

Ok first we would like to give a very big thanks to SuzD for helping 
me to solve my mailing problems with out her we would have been about 
three days behind our  plans.  So thank you Den Mother : ).

Second to those of you who joined we  sent out an email to you last 
night If you did not get the dinner invit please email me. We know a 
few of you did not but stupid me trashed the bad returns so I  dont 
have your names.

Shortly based on the invites ISBA\'s publishing arm will give a list 
of members and contacted people ass that is still being complied at 
this time. We want to say thanks for all the TML support for the 
ISBA, and trust us  ISBA will not disapear off the list but just 
become more organized and take up less ban width.We think this 
should please most people.

Lastly,we  got  some mail from Paul and yes ISBA well host suppose 
THUDD and help it an anyway , justwe were  not sure Paul wanted this.
We have not worked out any details but we want Paul and the others to 
still run THUDD.

This is about as cheap a 200dt ship as you can make in QSDS at TL 12 (I\'ve
designed this ship from scratch so many times I can do it in my sleep). I
suspect that Roderick\'s CDB-2 is seriously broken (beyond the TL-9
controls running the TL-12 equipment) For one thing he\'s missing some huge
drain of power, somewhere, because his thruster plates take almost 60 MW
of power themselves, And the QSDS hull requires 55 MW (which includes all
the life support, inertial compensators, beer refrigerators, etc.) Either
that or there a SERIOUS inequities between SSDS and QSDS.
 
Secondly, under the QSDS rules at least, the Box S hull has the highest
amount of free space available. He\'s added 11 more small staterooms than
I\'ve got (22 dT) PLUS a 5 dT lounge! And he STILL has 105 dT free??? And
he\'s CHEAPER by 5 MCr??? This can\'t be, not if he\'s using SSDS to design
the ships, because QSDS should let you build a cheaper ship than SSDS

His numbers don\'t add up. A quick build of the CDB-2 at TL 12 in QSDS
leaves less than 95 dT free cargo space. 

Here\'s my take on YugoBox economics:
		
Total cost:	57.8 MCr
Down Payment:	11.56 MCr		
			
Monthly Mortgage:	0.241 MCr		
Crew Salaries (2)	0.009		
Life support		0.004		
ann maintenance		0.005		
Fuel              	0         that\'s why we have scoops! (even though,
at 3 dT/hour it\'ll take over 13 hours to purify a full fuel load...not
exactly quick getaway time!)	
			
Total monthly     	0.259 mCr	
			
Cargo             	0.231  mCr/month
(2 trips / month 115.5 dT cargo, 1000Cr/dT)
Passengers              0.040 mCr/month
(2 trips/month 2 mid passengers each time, though this would be a rather
\'roughing it\' approach to star travel)

You can\'t break even. Not with just freight! With a full load of
passengers each trip, you only make about 10,000 credits profit a trip.
This wouldn\'t be economical at all, unless you could absolutely be sure of
filling your hold and spare staterooms each and every run.

If you just haul freight, with  a standard crew, or even a skeleton crew,
you\'re going to go broke.

One thing I think we should consider doing, is include the worksheet we
use to figure this stuff up, maybe then we can see where these things are
going wrong (or right as the case may be)

here\'s mine hot off the spreadsheet:

Description			Vol	Power	Cost	Area	Crew

	And Vladimir adds: " If any one can beat this price they\'re either
lyin\' cheats or some of those $@#!@# ISBA gangsters with stolen parts in
their inventory!" ;-)

	It\'s fascinating, though, to watch the progress of error catching
in QSDS...the very first YugoBox design I posted had 140 dT of free cargo
and cost something like 27 mCr!

campaign; as I\'ve said before, it\'s a dirty job being the scum of the
spaceways, but somebody\'s got to do it.  However, as you will see my
players are rising admirably to the task :)


THE CAST:

Isaac Xyroli: a young, brash, and arrogant ex-Scout, currently working for
Ling Standard as pilot on the Frozen Glory, a FSY Mouffette-Rapide class
far courier.  Played by the TML\'s own Ross Coburn.

Leemcha Quo: Ascetic no-nonsense 35-year-old Asian/Vilani ex-Navy
Astrogator.  Cold, serious, no nonsense.  Played by a non-TMLer.

Dr. Ilbren Dinaskir: A Vilani archaeologist of humble origins, specializing
in the Rule-of-Man period, who rose to his present recently tenured
position due to his own brilliance and not to his humble origins on an
algae farm.  Played by TML\'er Glenn Grant.

Lt. Jack 23: A strong, silent, dangerous type with "military" written all
over him; formerly a marine, now working for Ling Standard Security.  Has
manged to overcome his underprivileged youth as an orphan in a Solomani
Genetic Collective rather nicely.  Again, played by nobody you know.

Lt. Kyle Deschenko: A nice, genteel thug from one of the best of families.
Despite coming from a well-off family (SOC A), he nevertheless managed to
get sent to a military academy for his youthful misdeeds.  After a stint in
the Navy, he spent some time as a Rogue before getting hired by Ling.  Has
every weapon-related skill save Heavy Weapons.  Likewise, played by a
non-TMLer.


Episode 3: Hoist and Re-hoist!


Scene 1:

        The game picked up right where we left, on the tarmac on
Archipelago\'s spaceport, in the Frozen Glory.  Xyroli, Dr. Dinaskir, and
Lt. Duschenko are being interrogated by Archipelagan Agency police in
connection with the discovery of the Frozen Glory\'s engineer\'s corpse and
disappearance of their gunner.  This is an inconvenience, as they had
wished to depart that morning.  Xyroli, being somewhat disgruntled at his
treatment by Ling, gets pushed to far by an Agency cop and triggers the
anti-hijacking system.

        The anti-hijacking system, being one of Famille Spofulam Defense
Subsystem\'s latest models, ascertains that the situation on board has yet
to turn violent, that it is on the ground at a class B starport, and that
the only non-crew personnel on board have Imperial ID\'s stating that they
are planetary law enforcement personnel.  It immediately closes and locks
all iris valves and doorways, shuts down the power plant, deploys very
menacing-looking microturrets, warns all on board to freeze and not make
any hostile moves, and places comm alerts to spaceport security, Ling\'s HQ,
and Famille Spofulam\'s service rep.  It then advises Leemcha, alone in the
cockpit, of the situation.  Xyroli, down in the lounge, tries to convince
the anti-hijack subroutine to listen to him, but Leemcha, figuring that the
negotiations will proceed better with him out of the way, orders the
antihijack system to deploy knockout gas throughout the lower regions of
the ship.   She meanwhile enters the cockpit airlock, dons her vac suit,
and descends to the lounge.  She collects Xyroli, securely immobilizes him
with unidirectional bonding strip (well, TL-12 duct tape), dumps him in his
stateroom, Blurs him, and turns the gravity up to the maximum.

        Meanwhile, the antihijacking subroutine, having ascertained the
identity of the starport police, lets them in the lower airlock.  They
proceed to collect all the unconscious bodies and dump them on the tarmac
to recover.  Leemcha immediately calls the hospital where Lt. 23 has been
staying, and has him put on an ambulance for immediate delivery to the
ship.  The starport police and the Agency police engage in a lively
discussion of their respective jurisdictions.  Shortly thereafter, a squad
of Agency Environmental Emergency Intervention personnel arrive in
protective suits and start waving sensors around and taking air samples to
ascertain the environmental impact of venting the knockout gas.  Soon
thereafter Fanderbrees, a Ling executive, arrives, followed in short order
by Ling\'s corporate counsel and the Agency\'s Chief Counsel.  Then the four
security troops the Frozen Glory was to pick up, and that Xyroli wanted to
leave without, arrive, followed shortly by Lt. 23.  Everyone becomes
involved in a fascinating discussion of planetary police jurisdiction under
the Restoration Proclamation while the gassing victims come to.

        Meanwhile, back on board, Lt. Duschenko, who is guarding Xyroli,
and Xyroli discuss plans to essentially steal the ship (because Xyroli is
really disgruntled by now and Duschenko has never lost touch with his inner
criminal), and come up with a plan to extort the ship out of Ling in return
for withheld information on the Rule of Man site they are to excavate.
Leemcha is listening into all this via the intercom as she reboots the
fusion plant.

        While this is going on, the Yacht Messalina, an FSY Caligula-class
megayacht, arrives at the spaceport.  The crew of the Frozen Glory are not
pleased, as this means that the competition has arrived.

        Eventually, it is decided that the Agency police were out of their
jurisdiction.  Ling\'s counsel and the Agency\'s counsel hammer out a deal
wherein Ling will post a bond as to their eventual return and cooperation
in the murder investigation, thus obviating a potential diplomatic fuss.
The Frozen Glory departs, and Xyroli and Leemcha have a tense scene in the
cockpit (Xyroli being rather upset at her for blurring him, and she being
rather annoyed at Xyroli\'s general loose cannoninity).  She agrees,
however, in principle, to their plan subject to them not having to actually
harm anybody.

Scene 2: The double jump to Skrunge takes a morose two weeks; Lt. 23 is
annoyed at Xyroli and has told him to behave or be shot, the ship is
overcrowded by 100% of its normal complement, and everybody is in a bad
mood.  However, they emerge on time and on target near Skrunge (which, due
to its ice caps and permanent storms along the terminators and
near-desert-like conditions neard midday (recall it has a 920-hour day),
looks rather like a large, slit-pupilled eye from a distance.  From orbit,
they deploy two survey sats.  They quickly locate their site; from orbit a
500-meter wide plascrete landing pad returns one hell of an echo. The site
being located about 80 hours away from dusk (and about 60 from the
nightfall terminator storm) They proceed to land.

        The site itself is located next to a large, very eroded mesa.  From
the outside, it appears to consist of a 500-meter wide landing pad (covered
by about 75 cm of topsoil and vegetation, surrounded by four 10-meter wide
by 50-meter deep silos, and a large superdense door in the side of the
mesa.  They land, Dr. Dinaskir being the first out to claim Skrunge in the
name of Science and them Imperium.  The four security troops proceed to
verify the security of the immediate landing area, discovering a number of
rather ugly but otherwise harmless native life forms, which display an odd,
9-fold symmetry in their anatomy.  Initial exploration reveals the
interesting development of a small cairn of rocks beside each silo.
Further investigation of the cairns reveals TL-0 ropes, woven out of native
plant fibers, carefully stored between what appear to have been carapaces
formerly belonging to native life forms.  This is rather odd news, as
Skrunge is of course  uninhabited by humaniti, and no native life forms
were even close to intelligence.

        Descent (with Lt. 23 and Xyroli remaining on board) into one of the
silos reveals a large garbage midden at the bottom, and a wide corridor
leading towards the mesa.  Exploration of the corridor reveals some
partially functioning, proximity-activated lights, and the fact that the
corridors do indeed appear to have been inhabited; fireplaces abound, the
ceiling is thick with soot, and detritus, animal remains, broken TL-0
atifacts made of local animal life body parts, and fecal pellets abound.
They also notice very crude glyphs, daubed with mud, every 10 meters or so
along the walls, which they interpret as territorial markers. They also
note that the glyphs are rather high up on the walls (about 1.8 meters from
the floor), and that they appear to have been traced by manipulative
members that sport rather prominent claws or nails.  At this point, fatigue
begins to overtake them, and they return to the ship for a rest period, as
they encountered superdense doors at the end of the corridor.


Scene 3: Their rest period over, and feeling strangely jetlagged because
their circadian rythms are totally out of synch with Skrunge\'s long day,
they arise and continue their explorations, with Lt. Duschenko spending the
morning coding a virus to be uploaded to their surveysats that will totally
bugger up the antihijack systems (which are also Famille Spofulam products)
on the Messalina by resetting all the crew identification records, thereby
having the antihijacking system turn upon the hapless vessel\'s crew (they\'d
hatched this cunning plan, you see, involving salvaging it, the evil little
so & so\'s...).  Meanwhile, Dr. Dinaskir and Leemcha, along with the Ling
security troops, have taken to further exploration of the corridors
connecting the silos.  This investigation reveals much the same evidence of
TL-0 inhabitation as the first corridor.  That afternoon they return with
laser cutters and start work on the doors at the end of the corridor.

        However, they are interrupted by the arrival insystem, about a week
earlier than expected, of the Messalina (which apparently had been
retrofitted to J-3 at some point).  The owner of the Messalina, Dame Sisao
hault Joostens, is bearing an Imperial Edict declaring the Skrunge system
to be a Red Zone, and orders them offplanet within an hour.

        The crew are highly annoyed.  Xyroli, in order to gain the others
time, takes off at 8 G\'s and goes messing around, being recalcitrant and
stalling as hard as he can (and routing his communications through the
surveysats in order to draw the Messalina\'s attention to them in the hopes
it will download Lt. Duschenko\'s virus).  However, the Messalina\'s sensors
detect the neutrino emissions from the air raft\'s power plant and the grav
signature of Leemcha\'s vacc suit\'s grav module, and under threats of
extremely dire Imperial legal nastiness, Xyroli is compelled to return to
the site by Lt. 23.

        Meanwhile, underground, Dr. Dinaskir, Lemmcha, and Lt. Duschenko
have cut through the door, revealing a huge cavern apparently hollowed out
by a nuclear explosion.  At the center of the cavern is a large dome,
surrounded by four L-shaped buildings, and some roadways.  They barely have
time to ascertain that the dome is sealed, and that the outbuildings have
been stripped of everything down to the light fixtures, before they have to
return to the ship, more or less at gunpoint (the Messalina sent a platoon
of troops after them).  Despondent (but rather hopeful for their virus),
the Frozen Glory departs to refuel at the system\'s gas giant.

        However, some days later, as they are exiting the gas giant\'s
atmosphere with full tanks, they recieve a brief, garbled distress call
from the Messalina, replete with screams, banging, more screams, some
thuds, an odd chittering noise, and what appears to be something bashing in
the comm panel with a blunt object...  and I called the session there.

        We\'ll resume next week.  Stay tuned.

============================================================================
This document is a very much simplified part of my Traveller space combat rules
system. It can be used by any reasonably detailed design system with some work.
I have skipped on my gravity rules, rules for stable orbits, to hit, damage,
aerobrake et c because they are too designsystem specific and frankly to hard
to explain without pictures.

Here\'s a short example of what is possible with this system:
The players wants to sneak onto Victoria without the interdiction satellites
detecting them. The GM runs the satellites and the by the players unknown
Survey cruiser. The players succeed in exiting jumpspace inside Victorias
planetary shadow and they stay with PP on idle, popup antennas popped down and
floorfield off for minimal sig. They wait until Victorias moon Albert passes
around and when 3 of the interdiction sats are blocked by Albert they fire up
the PP, thrusts a little and continues gliding towards victoria. They aerobrake
in Victorias atmosphere as they swing onto the sunside of victoria, ready for
landing. Before entering the atmosphere for good they dare a quick popup of
their PEMS but see nothing. No combat, no deaths but still a pretty exciting
session.

continue rolling this 1D6 until the 5+ roll fails.
Rolling low is basically the same. Roll 2 on 2D6, then roll 1D6 for 2- and
continue until failure. Each 2- roll lowers the score by 1.

Logarithms
I use logarithmic values all the time in my rules but in these rules only one
logarithmic scale is needed. The scale goes like this:

Value   Log(Value)
0.5+    -4
1.5+    -3
5+      -2
15+     -1
50+     0
150+    1
500+    2
1500+   3 et c
Remember when dealing with logs that adds of logs are equivalent to multiplies
and subtractions to divisions, +2 equals multiply by 10 and -2 divide by 10 in
this scale. Ranges follow the same progression:
1.5 squares, 5 squares, 15 squares, 50 squares et c.
This logscale is used throughout but with different base values. The one above
has a base value of 50 which means that 50 equals 0.

Facings and grid
================
I use a square grid myself for all maps be it space combat, brawls et c and I
always use the same facing sectors to divide the plane into 8 similarly sized
sectors. Those using hexgrids can use six sectors but some of the rules
regarding blind and semiblind sectors might not work in that case.
When calculating range for all purposes treat all diagonals as 1.5 squares and
round the final range down. OK the facing sectors look like this:
Mark your own location, the first square away from it N, E, W or S is 1 wide,
squares 2 to 3 away are 3 wide, squares 4, 5 and 6 are 5 wide like this:

                  x x x
              x x x x x
        x x x x x x x x
    x x x x x x x x x x
o x x x x x x x x x x x
    x x x x x x x x x x
        x x x x x x x x
              x x x x x
                  x x x
o
  x
    x x
    x x x x x
      x x x x x x
      x x x x x x x x x
      x x x x x x x x x
        x x x x x x x x
        x x x x x x x x
          x x x x x x x
          x x x x x x x
          x x x x x x x

Or put it another way: Go one right, one right and one up, two right and one
up, three right and one up, two right and one up. Alternate between two and
three for each step to get it done. If this is hard to follow then use whatever
sectors you like as long as they are 8 more or less equally sized arcwise. I
have printed these sectors on overhead film but I rarely use them as I know the
progression by heart.

My game has MUCH smaller scale to space combat, sensor ranges et c because I
want to hide behind planetary shadows, aerobrake in atmospheres while fighting
et c but these rules work with any size squares as long as one sticks to them.
My squares are 1000 km wide which gives you gameturns of aproximately 5 minutes
and a thrust vector of 1G is 1 square.

When calculating ranges on a square grid count each diagonal square as 1.5 and
round down whendone tracing range. This is surprisingly close to pythagoras
the expected value.

Needed shipstats
================
There are some statistics that are required for each target and should be
precomputed when designing the ship/missile/whatever. Notice that certain
signatures only are detectable if certain things are in use, others vary
depending on the level of activity of said device. I normally calculate sigs
for full use and off but one could calculate powerplant sigs for 100% power and
10% idle for instance (10% is imply -2 from full due to the logarithmic
scale). I use four different signatures for each target, the signatures
are: Active EMS
or AEMS, Passive EMS or PEMS, Neutrino and Mass.

AEMS: Use surface area/6 or volume^(2/3) if there\'s no radar area in the
design system used. Targets with stealth material surface should have their area
severely diminished, perhaps by x0.1, x0.01 or even x0.001
Base value for radar is 50 m2 or
Area(m2)        AEMS-signature
15+             -1
50+             0
150+            1
500+            2
1500+           3 et c

PEMS: Passive EMS get their readings from IR venting from Powerplants,
reflected light from star(s), rocket plume from reactionthrusters.
Power(MW)       PEMS-signature
15+             -1
50+             0
150+            1
500+            2
1500+           3 et c

Area(m2)        PEMS-signature
50+             -4
150+            -3
500+            -2
1500+           -1
5000+           0
15000+          1
50000+          2
150000+         3
The light from star(s) is added later in the system, therefore the low sig
here. This sig is the ships reflected sig if in planetary shadow. Stealth
material hulls and black hulls should perhaps modify this by -2.

Thrust(ton)     PEMS-signature (my system uses different values for diff. types)
0.015           -1
0.05            0
0.15            1
0.5             2
1.5             3
5               4
15              5
50              6
150             7
500             8
1500            9
5000            10
15000           11 et c

Neutrino: Neutrino sensor is definately the most important sensor in Travller
both because it can be mounted under the armor and because it is so hard
to shield neutrinos and everybody uses fusion powerplants. Neutrinos come from
fission/fusion powerplants and fission/fusion thrusters.
Power(MW)       NEUT-signature
15+             -1
50+             0
150+            1
500+            2
1500+           3 et c
Notice that for fusion/fission plants the neutrino sig is the same as the
PEMS-sig for powerplants. Makes the rules a bit easier to use.

Thrust(ton)     NEUT-signature
15+             -1
50+             0
150+            1
500+            2
1500+           3 et c
Notice that for fusion/fission thrusters the neutrino sig is the same as the
PEMS-sig for thrusters - 6. Makes the rules a bit easier to use.

Mass: Mass is hard to cloak and an important signature in my Traveller,
especially if the targets use antigravity/thrusterplates or floorfield/inertial
compensators. Note that because of some technobabble my gravscanner sensors has
to be mounted outside of the hull just like AEMS and PEMS.
Mass(ton)       MASS-signature
150+            -1
500+            0
1500+           1
5000+           2
15000+          3 et c

Thrust(ton)     MASS-signature
15+             -1
50+             0
150+            1
500+            2
1500+           3 et c
Notice that mass sig for antigrav/thrusterplates is the same as the
PEMS-sig for thrusters. Makes the rules a bit easier to use.

Volume(m3)      MASS-signature
15+             -1
50+             0
150+            1
500+            2
1500+           3 et c
This is the mass signature from floorfield/inertial compensators. It is based
on the volume compensated.

Example:
The scoutship in TNE is 1400 m3 which gives a surface of ca 125 m2. It masses
685 tons loaded. The powerplant is a 138 MW fusion plant and it has a HEPLAR
drive with ca 1370 tons thrust. Lets say it is inertially comped. and living
area is 500 m3 in size. Lets rate this ship:
AEMS:   0
PEMS:   0 Power         -4 Reflected    8 Thrust
NEUT:   0 Power
MASS:   0 Mass          2 Antigrav      2 Inertial compensators


Rating sensors
==============
There are four different types of sensors in my campaign namely:
Active EMS, Passive EMS, Neutrino and Mass detectors. I use my own design
system so those converting from FF&S can use the guidelines to below to rate
their sensors.

AEMS
Range(squares)  Factor
1-              -8
5-              -4
15-             0
50-             4
150-            8
500-           12 et c

PEMS, NEUT and MASS
Range(squares)  Factor
1-              -4
5-              -2
15-             0
50-             2
150-            4
500-            6 et c

Rating HighGuard designs: There are no sensors in HG so a quick and dirty
ruling has to be made regarding that. Give each ship AEMS and PEMS ratings of
computer model nbr - 6. Add size figure from USP for this (if size is less than
1 use -1 if 10dTon or more, -2 if not). The sensors are assumed to be included
in the computer price and the bonus for size is the larger surface area for
antennas. Give large military vessels NEUT and MASS sensors with factors 2 less
than AEMS/PEMS. Large scouts have NEUT and MASS with without reduction and
merchants never have anything but AEMS/PEMS (well, maybe Leviathan could find
uses for a weak NEUT sensor for detecting fusion plants).

Example: The scout in TNE has a 5 hex PEMS, 10 hex AEMS. The densitometer and
neutrinodetector I have no idea what their ranges are so I will not rate them.
AEMS:   -2
PEMS:   0

Sequence of play
================
Drift
Movement
Sensors
Combat

Drift
=====
Move all ships according to their vector and adjust for gravity effects. Note
that ships with antigrav units should be able to choose wether gravity affects
them or not (shouldn\'t they?). Use Mayday or Battle Rider movement or even BL
if you can stand the ugly system (borrowed from SPI DeltaVee I think).

I plot my ships moves on a graph paper with 5 mm squares and simply mark an x
where the ship should be if it didn\'t thrust.

For gravity effects I calculate several gravity bands by calculating:
R = 6.4xSQRT(M/A) where M is planet mass and A=0.25 for the limit of 0.5G,
A=0.75 for the limit of 1G, A=1.5 for the limit of 2G et c. When a ships
previous location is within a
gravity band move his drifted location by the amount and direction for the
previous location. 0.5 G only produce a 1G gravity vector on even turns.
My gravthrusters/contragrav has thrust egual to designed thrust times local
gravity so orbital fighters with contragrav can zoom close to planets and
really get a boost from the planets gravity field.

Movement
========
All tracked targets move first. The order within this group is determined with
a Pilot task roll, highest goes last.
All untracked targets plot their movement secretly.

Sensors
=======
Each player plots where his sensors will look for targets secretly or a
competitive Task roll with Fleet tactics decides. Highest result goes last as
this is advantageous. Sensorscans is basically performed by choosing a square
called the scanpoint away from your ship, modifying the sensors factor for the
range to the scanpoint, choosing one of two possible radii around the scanpoint
and modify factor accordingly.
Tell the opponent the sensor type (AEMS, PEMS, NEUT or MASS),factor, scanpoint
and radius. The opponent checks if any of his ships/missiles are within the
radius and if so; adds the sensors factor to all of his relevant sigs and sees
if any of these sigs sums is 0 or higher.

There are two sizes; small or normal.
Normal: Radius is the range to the scanpoint - 1.
Small: Radius is the range to the scanpoint divided by 2.
It is entirely legal for players to use smaller radii than those allowed in
order to fool the opponent about the range between sensing ship and scanpoint.
All squares within the scanned area has to be visible to the scanning ship to
be legal, move scanpoint or reduce radius if not. This is the single most
common error my players do when playing this system so be careful.

Modifications to sensorfactor
The sensorfactor is modified by three different circumstances:

Range to scanpoint affects the factor differently for passive and active
sensors:
Range(squares)  Passive Active
1-              +4      +8
5-              +2      +4
15-             0       0
50-             -2      -4
150-            -4      -8

Small or normal sensorscan
Pin*    +6
Small   +2
Normal  +0
*Pin is when you scan in such a tight beam so that only one square is searched.
When tracking an enemy with lock on at the limits of your sensors range it is
easy to use Pin as they have to tell you where they\'ll go before you decide on
where to put your scancenters.

Skill level of the sensoroperator (optional)
Roll a task in whatever task system used:
(these modifiers are set to discourage using this task unless highly skilled)
Result                          Modifier
Exceptional success             +2
Success                         0
Failure                         -2
Exceptional failure             -4

Sunfactor (optional but really fun to use)
==========================================
The sun or suns affect sensors and add some interesting tactical complications
to space combat. The direction to the sun is important because sensorscans in
that direction are harder for obvious reasons. The sun also affects a targets
reflective signature making it easier to detect if illuminated by the sun(s).
If the system consists of one star choose a direction where the sun lies (I
always use North as sundirection for ease of play). Close binaries will
probably be in the same direction and far binaries will have only one of the
stars giving off signinficant light.
To calculate the sunfactor from a particular star use this formula, treat
negative results as 0 because I choose background illumination to be 0:
S = 2*log10(L/R^2) + 6
S = sunfactor, L = starts luminosity, R = distance to star in AU
If you\'re lazy (or in a hurry) you can use 6 + orbit number distance from
hospitable, + for inner system and - for outer system. The result will be more
or less the same as you can see below for the solar system:

Planet          SF
==============
Mercury         8
Venus           7
Earth           6
Mars            5
Asteroids       4
Jupiter         3 etc

A ships reflective PEMS sig is actually the one rated above plus SF if
illuminated by the star. If more than one star is illuminating, add the highest
SF (remember these are logarithms, adds are really multiplies).
The scout if in earthorbit and not in planetary shadow will have a reflective
PEMS sig of -4 +6 = +2.

Scanpoints has to be at least 45 degrees from the suns direction if small and
at least 90 degrees if normal to not be affected by sunfactor. Those closer
than these angles subtract the sunfactor from scanfactor if the scanning ship
isn\'t in planetary shadow. Note that NEUT sensors are never in planetary
shadow, those solar neutrinos will pass through planets like nothing. Note also
that MASS sensors never need to worry about the solar direction but neither can
they scan through planets like the NEUT ones.

Example: The aforementioned scout chooses a square 17 squares away in
coordinates x-18 y-45. He uses a normal scan and his PEMS has a factor of 0.
He rolls a sucess at the sensor task. His factor is:
0(original) -2(range) +0(success) = -2
The radius is 16 (17-1)
He tells the other player "OK I put a PEMS scan at 18 45, factor -2 radius 16
If the opponent has anything within 16 squares from 18,45 and they have any
PEMS sig of +2 or higher he has to respond.

Detection
=========
Sum the scan factor with your sig and if 0 or higher consult the chart below.
You must tell the player all sigs that are 0 or better.

Scanfactor + Sig:
0-1: Indicated;  tell location but not vector, tell highest sig for that sensor
but not targettype.
2-3: Detected;  tell location and vector, tell highest sig for that sensor but
not targettype.
4+: Locked;  tell location and vector, tell all indicated+ sigs for that sensor
and targettype.It will remain locked until no sensor from this ship has it
Indicated or better for a round.

Combat
======
a: Beam weapons attack and implement damage.
b: Surviving missiles hit and implement damage.
Within each subphase first fire is determined by a shiptactics task roll and
damage effects are inflicted before the next ship may fire.

        <FLASH>PRESS RELEASE<FLASH>

        Massilia News Network
        Arar (Massilia 1104), 0001.004

        Amahrt Burkinshaw, spokesperson for the Traianus Corporation,
announced today that this growing company has decided to join the recently
created Imperium Ship Builders\' Association.
        "Traianus Corporation - Mr. Burkinshaw stated - is wishing to
collaborate in extending the benefits of standardization and professionalism
to the whole Massilia sector.
        This statement was followed by an angered response by Kradee Thern,
commercial adjoint to the Geonee embassy in Arar and representative of the
Geonee shareholders which hold 7% of the participations of Traianus
Corporation. Mr. Thern stated that the directives of Traianus Corporation
had acted against the shareholders interests by joining the ISBA, and called
for a General Assembly. "Traianus Corporation - he said - is not by any
means a Sylean company, and thus to have it joining a Sylean, or Imperial,
or whatever, association, is just nonsense".
        Traianus Corporation owns extensive shipyards at Arar - whose
starport was upgraded to type A with Imperial economic support ten years
ago, but also maintains operations at both Imperial and non-Imperial worlds
in Arar, Vaait and Shiwonee subsectors, among others. The property of the
company is heavily distributed among noble families, individual worlds,
banks, and other corporations, being the Traianus Family the greatest
shareholder with a 24%.

The above is reasonable; the exact Pens for USP 0, 1, 2, and 3

This linear extrapolation is NOT reasonable!
For example, your table would set a Pen of 55 to about 8, right?
The correct USP for a Pen of 55 is around 11, and neither your
table or your suggested conversion (Pen/10) even come close.

Both PEN and USP exponential progressions; but on different scales;
there\'s unfortunately not a linear relationship between them.
I gave a conversion chart between the various armor values in
a recent Traveller Answer post.

> A pen of 135 well it off the scale for right now.

A Pen of 135 is probably impossible for a ship-mounted weapon.

Yes you may be correct, but for nuclear blast of 100kt it is not. Using 3G3
you can design weapons that get to a pen of 135, but they are big and costly.

You really should check before you post to the TML.  That\'s what the
Beta list is for; the designers of CSC, SSDS, and QSDS are all on that 
list - and you\'re a Beta list member, too.

> Ok could you send that to me I must have missed it then.

Even better, I can give you the exact formula to convert from Pen to USD (as
Greg Porter pointed out in e-mail, the conversions I posted are correct for
the case of converting from USD to Pen, and not the other way around).

PenCM = (Pen / 6) ^ 3

Where "PenCM" is penetration expressed in centimeters (of armor steel), and
"Pen" is the CSC penetration of the weapon.

Then lookup PenCM on the table in the back of _Starships_ to find the USD.

Stressful, yes, tiring, no.  Most folks who\'ve been in combat that were
willing to discuss it (generally Vietnam era) made the observation that
they never noticed being tired, drained, or winded, until they had a moment
to pause...  Then the couldn\'t move for days...

Adrenaline, along with endorphins (I wish synthetics were legally
producible!), alleviate that tiredness rather quickly in a way that we only
wish caffeine could.  Think about that close call driving because you were
sleepy that woke you up for the rest of the trip!

Well that may be ok, but I do not have "Starships" and have no intension on
buying it at all. Do any of the online versions of SSDS have the penCM table?

    'body' => 'Some time back Wildstar pontificated upon the general workings of
jumpdrives, and there was some discussion of jump signatures.  However, I\'m
curious about other folks\' ideas about the nature of jumping and J-space.
If anyone has online resources discussing this, I\'d be interested in
knowing about it, and if not, I\'d like to spark discussion with the
following questions:

1. It seems generally accepted that a ship creates a N-space bubble around
itself before and during a jump.  What, if anything, does such a thing look
like (visually or through other sensing methods)?  Do the crew notice any
differences when the bubble is formed?

2. The actual act of entering J-space involves a massive burst of energy.
What does an observer see when a ship enters J-space?  If a crewmember were
looking out a viewport, what would they see?  Does the event affect the
crew at all (sensations, etc.)?

3. Once in J-space, what, if anything, do crew looking out viewports see?
What sort of sensor readings does the ship get?

4. If energy or matter is introduced to the N-space-J-space boundary, what
happens?  Could this endanger the jumping ship?

5. If for some reason the N-space bubble drops while in J-space, what happens?

6. When a ship re-enters N-space, what do observers (on and off the ship)
see or feel?

7. Are the different races\' and manufacturers\' jumpdrives sufficiently
different to generate identifiable signatures for those who know what to
look for?

I have a few ideas about these myself, but there do not seem to be any
\'canonical\' answers that I\'ve found.  I\'d just like to see what other
\'bullshitium\' rationalizations are out there.

Yeah.  For example, take a 2000 MW need.  You can go with either, 
  A)  one hundred 20 MW plants, at zero crew
  B)  ten 200 MW plants, at two crew
  C)  one 2000 MW plant, at 1.7 crew.

While most of the time this is discouraged by the rounding "errors" which
result in bigger, pricier plants at the bottom of the table, I\'d say that
this deserves a clarification to avoid abuse.  I\'ve been trying to "play
fair" with this, by picking the biggest I can fit and working my way down
to get the total I need, for the most part.  This is probably only a
problem with the zero crew plants.

    'body' => '  I agree fully with the idea that bulk carriers are doing most of the
Imperium\'s shipping.  Compared to a 200T Far Trader, a ship of 800T, let
alone several thousand, is much more profitable.  For example, as part of
my work on the Far Trader design, I developed the "Serious Work Ball" - an
800T merchant with J2 that was just a Far Trader with four times the
capacity in terms of pasengers.  The Far Trader (which duplicated the CT
version faithfully) was unprofitable (just like the CT design); the
Serious Work Ball turned a tidy profit.

  This is due to some scale effects in QSDS, by the way, and may not be
true for SSDS.  In QSDS, the cost of controls, sensors, and other
necessary equipment is fixed - larger ships can spread that cost over more
cargo space.  Moreover, there are real problems prior to TL 12 with small
ships - since even the smallest ships have to have a really big fusion
generator, lots of space is taken up by the power plant that can\'t be used
for cargo.  It makes for an interesting break point, in that small
traders, esp in the under 500T class, can be commercially viable (but only
just) at TL12 but not before.  Perhaps the flexibility this gives to trade
is part of what makes the Sylean empire grow - I thinks it makes sense, at
least from the preliminary numbers I\'ve been running. 

  After I\'ve finished my Far Trader design, I\'m going to write up some of
my thoughts on starship economics, based on the cost of passenger and
freight trave.  The cost differential of High vs. Middle passage is broken
economically (you make so much more on middle passengers it\'s not funny!),
largely because CT only allowed 4 Ton cabins; now that Middle passengers
get by on 2 Tons, well, the economics don\'t make sense.  Perfect place for
the insertion of government regulations to explain marketplace
distortions, though.

old question of whether free traders could possibly exist at 1000cr/ton
freight charges. (This is turning into another One OF Those Topics, folks,
like rocks, feudal technocracy and Virus)

When the Imperium gets going, this is why free traders and far traders
can\'t live on 1000 cr/t freight charges. Now, at the very beginning of the
third Imperium, there\'s a lot more stuff floating around, because the
largest amount of trade is going to be outside the imperium, where the
costs of cargo are what the market will bear. In fact, if the 1000 cr/dt
figure is an Imperial decree, this would be a powerful argument for
independent worlds to join the Imperium, and could account for the truly
rapid expansion we see, by canon timeline.

The only question is how did the Imperium ever afford this in the first
place??

That is why Free Traders or other small freighters are mainly found on 
the borders of tHe Imperium. Shipping small cargos to off-way worlds 
were there is a chance of making a profit.

Off course. But when you want to ship a small cargo to a off-way world
where there is no regular traffic, your only hope is to pay what ever
the free, fat, far trader charges.

But no huge tanker ships oil to a small eskimo-village on Greenland. That
is an area where smaller boats ship cargo.

Or being based in low standard shipping areas, or shipping mostly special
stuff. Maybe like a World Wide Express delivery system. I would also
guess that large freighters go by predetermined routes, so if you want to
move cargo fast to a world, a smaller ship might be the only solution.

It should be lower or the economical system is defintivly broken.

things right as far as the QSDS rules go.  The lack of profit with cargo
demonstrates the problem with trying to go with the cheapest possible
starship.  As I\'ll demonstrate in a later post, Middle passengers are the
route to high profits - I did a YugoBox-like design that replaced all the
cargo hold with 2 Ton passenger staterooms.  Even with the higher cost
(both construction and crew), it made a nice profit.  

  Problem is, passenger liners of a larger size are likely to take most of
that business, since they run regular routes and operate at higher profit
margins than 200T Far Traders.  Think of passenger traffic on a Far Trader
as more like dealing with the overflow from the big liners (if you are at
a high-pop planet) or those few folks on a low pop planet that want to
leave.  Far Traders have a mix of cargo and passenger space so that you
can pick up some money somewhere, especially when there aren\'t enough
passengers on one leg of the route.

  Speculation is neccesary, no doubt about it.

Oops... if you do this you need to include the time to move to the 
local GG to fuel in your trip time.  I seem to recall seeing on 
the list at some point that this would typically add something like
3 days per trip.  Which blows your 2 trips a month schedule out
of the water.  Also how does this work where there are no GGs and
the locals don\'t want your dirty ship in their pristine ocean?

Still you\'ve made some good points.  I know my players went,
"We can\'t make money on freight!!" and have had some lovely 
adventures getting their speculative cargo.  With more to come...

	I took this to be a rounding problem...that these take less than
0.05 crew member to operate...actual crewing requirements willbe close to
the actual size of the powerplant required...a 100 mW plant will take .1
crewmember; 10 10 mW will take the same.

OTOH, a free trader with a bazillion little Honda generators running in
the hold is a sight to behold, though ;-) I had a neighbor who had his
electricity cut off, once...he just hauled his construction site generator
out back of his apartment...for two weeks, until he resolved his dispute
with the electric co, we lived with one of those things running 24/7. Loud
and obnoxious!

This is definitely unclear in the rules.  My take on the issue is this:
In order to get a ship "flight rated" in the Imperium, you need to provide
facilities (including workstations, living space, and so forth) for the
\'rated\' crew requirement.  However, if less people are doing the jobs, it
doesn\'t involve running from seat to seat; instead, each workstation is a
generic interface unit, which can do any required job.  This mirrors the
trend here on TL 8 Terra, by the way; more and more interfaces to (say)
industrial control systems are just a PC running special software, rather
than dedicated units.

So, on a 100-ton vessel with a crew of one, we can imagine the poor
harried pilot swapping frantically between the "Engineering Status"
window, the "Navigation Tracking" window, the "Maneuver Control" window,
the "Communications" window...

Anybody who\'s ever heard a mysterious warning *beep* with 12 open
applications on the desktop knows just how effective this pilot will be if
something unusual happens. :)

From QSDS 1.5:

 Command Crew:  Total the above crew, and divide by six (round fractions
 to the nearest whole number).  This is the number of command crew.  They
        ^^^^^^^ [emphasis mine]
 will require workstations.

The above crew is everything but stewards and medics.  This means that you
need a Command officer in the example above.  (The nearest whole number to
the fraction 4/6 is one.)  If it means "one for every six", it should read
instead "drop all fractions".  Stewards and medics don\'t count toward this
total, but we end up with 5-7 in your example.  Another problem with the
sentence as written is whether to round up or down when the fraction is 
3/6 (0.5).  

As for the economic end, I\'ve been assuming that Command crew costs kCr 6
and Electronic crew kCr 5 per month, since there\'s been no statement on
this subject anywhere I can find.

	I think that Craig\'s dilemma here hits squarely on the role of the
far/free trader in the Traveller Universe.  Simply put, I don\'t see dinky
little ships like these providing the typical \'High Passage\' kind of
service at all...they\'re too small, and as Craig found out, soon need to
have way too many crew members. The same holds for all the armament that\'s
typically put on these things. 

	I have always seen the far trader as offering nothing more than
middle passage, actually, sort of like hitching a ride with a coastal
freighter. You job as passenger is to stay out of the way of the crew when
they\'re working, and if you want to eat, you go eat in the galley when the
crew eats...none of this \'Love Boat\' servant stuff

	Of course, this will vary depending on the roles played by the
PC\'s or NPC\'s who are the passengers on these things, but, I don\'t think
these small ships fit into the standardized shipping/passenger model we\'ve
been trying to shoehorn them into. They are speculative trading/casual
charter craft, and that\'s all. They don\'t get the 1000 cr/ton shipping
traffic, that\'s what the 10,000 ton container ships are for; they don\'t
get High passage customers...they go on Liners, not Far Traders! Heck,
I\'ll bet they have a hard time convincing people to pay Middle passage...

	These ships were intended, IMHO, form the start to be the
prototypical PC-owned ship, and not as a major economic force in the
Imperium, bound by the rules of High/Middle passage and 1kCr/T freight. As
we\'ve found, this sytem breaks when you try to apply these rules to small
ships like this. Either small ships (and ships in general) are a LOT
cheaper than the design systems would have them, or the trade that goes on
in the Imperium is not like the rules state. 

	As for armament, I, for one, want to see a return of the classic
\'triple threat\' turret that used to be available...one turret that carried
a beam or pulse laser, a missile rack and a sandcaster. This neatly solves
the \'I now need three gunners\' problem as well as letting a crew of two
both flee and fight. 

	Hey Guy, maybe in QSDS 2.0 you could add this? Maybe as a
component for ships of less than 4 or 500 tons, if nothing else?

Today Bertling Construction Companys ISBA-director Thomas Van Ferder
denied that Bertlings Design Division was having problems designing
a ship within the specifications of the Imperial THUDD-contest, and
this is the reason why Bertling so far has made no mention of entering
the presticious contest.

Many reporters had found the lack of involvment from Bertling strange
as they claim to be specialaizing in civilian freighers. "Wait and see"
was the only comment from the newly appointed ISBA-director for the
Bertling Construction Company.

You are actually comparing Battlestar Galactica to Babylon 5?  You

I liked Battlestar as a kid, but it doesn\'t even rate with the likes 
of B5.

For both of these, you should try my system.  There are only two half 
die (and we haven\'t found them to be that much of a problem--whole 
die are cleaner, but 1/2 die are necessary to get the right 
probabilities).

To calculate target number:
	(Skill x 2) + (Attribute / 2) round up

For the difficulties, change Staggering to 4D and Impossible to 5D.  
I\'ve run a probability study on this--accounting for both spectacular 
success and failure--and the probabilities fall right in line.  

This system keeps impossible tasks impossible.

> 3) after applying difficulty fix, chances were too huigh for both success
 and crit-fail.

Again, try my system.  Its easy.  It is a deriviative from the T4 
basic system, and it works.

Be a creative GM.  When I need to know time, I simply use the MT 
system.  It adapts painlessly to the T4 system.

> 5) Stats became more imoportant than skill, and easier to acquire.

This is one of the two main reasons I developed my task fix (the 
other is that the chance of success with the T4 basic system is too 
high).  By doubling the skill and halving the attribute, you get a 
target number close to what the T4 basic system gives you, but it is 
skewed to raise the importance of skill over attribute (yet, the 
attribute still has a major role in the calculation).

Yeah, I don\'t like the experience system either.  I think MT had the 
best system for this, but in general, Traveller has always had a weak 
experience system in all its incarnations.

This is my next project for my game--to develop a better experience 
system.

I like to stay as close to the official rules as I can.  It saves me 
a lot of continual conversion work and constant re-thinking.  I try 
to only change those things, like the task system, that I can\'t live 
with as written.

The problem is with ARMOR.  On step 15 it mentions: place the armor
value chosen here.  Well in the rest of the sequence ARMOR isn\'t
mentioned. However on the worksheet there is a field for armor mass and
volume.  

It just so happens I actually have Starships with me, so I can
answer this.

On page 70, under step 3, third paragraph.  It says
"Multiply that same Volume Factor by the armor level desired for the
volume taken up by the armor. "

Its pretty easy to miss that sentence.  You just pick the armor level
that you want, multiply by the Volume Factor. Then multiply the
volume by the density to get the mass, and by the price to get the
total cost.  

There are a few other mentions of armor in that paragraph. Mostly about
the price being effected by types of streamlining.

I hope this helps.

FIRST IDEA
Variable Ammo Damage
Dum Dum - roll one extra die for every two dice (round down), take the highest dice. ie a 
Magnum Pistol (doing 3D) using this type of ammo would roll 3D+1D and the damage 
would be the highest three. However armour absorbs damage at the same rate. So if you 
fired a 6D rifle using dumdum rounds it would get 9D, best 6 but armour absorbs 3 extra 
dice
HE - roll twice the number of dice, keep the best base number as above.
AP - as dum dum but keep the lowest three, and armour absorbs less on the same ratio

ie
Magnum PIstol
Ball 3D
DumDum 4D (best 3), Armour +1
HE 6D (best 3), Armour +3
AP 4D (lowest 3), Armour -1

SECOND IDEA
Shotguns are treated as 1D6 separate 1D attacks

The Bureau of Spacecrafr Safety, Heath, and Transit Standards is to send
a representative to the ISBA conference. In a short press conference,
Count Galliard Heuriss, director for the BSSHTS, announced today that he
has appointed Sir Ira Rimmer as the official liason to the ISBA. Count
Heuriss went on to explain his bureau\'s role in the ISBA.

"As I am sure you all know, the mandate of the (BSSHTS) is to develope
and maintain safety and habitabilty regulations so as to insure safe and
comfortable transit among the stars. With the formation of the Imperial
Starship Builder\'s Association, we of this bureau have a value
opportunity to work with a large cross-section of builders and
contractors and further this bureau\'s mission as never berfore known in
the history of manned spaceflight."

When asked about extra-Imperial companies being involved with the ISBA,
Count Heuriss had this to say, "In the 1700 years since the fall of the
Second Imperium, what few spacefaring cultures have arisen have
certainly developed safety standards of their own, and all new ideas
bear consideration. Furthermore, the standardization of safety and
health issues will help integrate new cultures as this Imperium expands
to fulfill its destiny."

Count Heuriss then closed the meeting with an explaination that he must
prepare for a later conference with the Emperor concerning the proposed
price fix of life-support fees.

Sir Ira Rimmer waved briefly at the media before departing abruptly for
a ship that was to transport him to the next ISBA conference.

 No, this list is for general discussion (not just techie
 discussion) of Traveller.  That includes floating ideas for
 background, criticising the unrealisms in the background (like
 those godawful unbelievable Nunclees in Aliens Archive), and in
 general, supporting Traveller in any of its incarnations.  Pure
 techiness can be found on the GDW-BETA list, and, for the
 language geeks out there (including me, so don\'t be getting
 your panties in a twist!), the TravLang list.

 While I certainly don\'t think that actually running a PBEM is
 an appropriate use for the list, I certainly have no objection
 to discussion of currently running PBEMs, or the posting of
 Traveller-related fiction, or the "interactive" creation of
 background details (such as the ISBA), and besides, as you
 indicate, some of that stuff is fun to read!

 As far as I\'m concerned, the ISBA can stay!

MEMORANDUM FOR:  IMMEDIATE NEWS RELEASE

SUBJECT:  CBW-A-0001-1 "Roland" Project Completion

  Custom Built Wreckage, Inc is proud to announce the completion of
the design phase of its first civilian production starship, the
CBW-A-0001-1 "Roland" class Far Trader.
  The Roland is an inexpensive starship designed for the private
entrepeneur or small trading company.  It is capable of carrying
twenty passengers and 66 Standard tons of cargo over short jump
distances both on and off normal trade routes.  Assuming a maximum
cargo and passenger manifest, the ship will be capable of operating at
a consistent profit without the need for speculation.
  Actual construction of the first Roland will begin within the month,
beginning with the construction and environmental stress-testing of
the hull and interior structure.
 
Technical Data:
Roland class Far Trader (SSDS)

Tons:  200 Std (Disk SL)	Loaded Mass:  2057 tonnes	Cost:  63.41 MCr

		    1 Sensor Op
		    The Piloting and Astrogation functions can be performed by a
single
		    crewman if necessary.  
		    Steward functions can be performed by the Gunners.

Small Craft:  2.0 Std allocated for Small Vehicle Storage.  One Grav
Truck (1.0 Std) or two small air rafts (0.6 Std) can be stored.

Accommodations:  1 Large Stateroom (Owner=B9s Cabin), 26 Small
Staterooms (6 Crew + 20 Passengers), 4 Low Berths


Blueprint Tour:
  The Roland class Far Trader is built on a 200 Standard ton,
streamlined disk hull.  There are two decks.  The lower deck is used
for cargo and quarters, and the upper deck is reserved for fuel
tankage.  
  The forward section of the ship is dominated by the 66 ton cargo
bay, which opens to the front and is flanked on either side by the two
main airlocks.  The cargo bay ceiling is 5 meters in height, tall
enough to stack two standard cargo modules (2x2x3.5 meters) on top of
each other.
  On the port side of the ship is the command center and the crew
quarters.  A narrow corridor runs around the cargo bay, connecting all
sections of the ship.  The aft quarter of the ship is occupied by the
engineering and drive section, the low berths, the ship=B9s locker,
and the small vehicle hangar.  Finally, the passenger staterooms are
located in the entire starboard side.  They are each 2 meters wide, 3
meters deep and 2.5 meters tall, stacked in columns of two to make
room for a modest common area (which includes sanfac units and ration
dispensers).  The upper row of staterooms is accessed by ladders on
each end of the corridor and has a 1 meter wide walkway.  The ship is
somewhat cramped, but the conditions are adequate for economy travel.
  The new Roland Far Trader will be built using high-quality, reliable
SSDS parts.

you are most interested in. You will then be broken into groups based on 
the number/ Membership you selected as well as the demand for a group.
In an unconfirmed report the Worcester Yards at Rotaer are rumored to be 
constructing a 337 Td Assault Ship for Sir Harold Worcester, third son of 
the Baron of Rotaer. Sir Harry, once a black sheep in the family, has 
returned from Pandrial where he served the government during the recent 
civil war. With him is a crack team of mercenaries. The ship is reported to 
be for registry as a Fast Trader. This reporter, however, has unconfirmed 
reports that the ship will be a cylinder air frame capable of 3 parsec FTL 
and 4G acceleration using the latest technology available. Unique to this 
design are separate power plants for each of the drive plates and a power 
load balancing unit. More details will follow as they are available.

Tammuz-Karst is pleased to announce it has completed preliminary
design of the TK-108 Far Trader.  We believe this ship represents
the best reasonable balanced design to the general Far Trader
conceptual configuration.  We note, however, that following the
standard economic models for monthly gross and rate of return
indicates that the TK-108 will not be profitable.  This is a
generic problem with small jump-2 transports at the current
level of technology, not limited to the TK-108, and we feel
that innovative use of the ship and trading potential can give
useful profitable service from this and similar models.
Potential owners are cautioned however that they may well
face difficulties in this regard.

While certain detailed layout designs are being kept proprietary
at this time, the general specifications are being announced here
to provide buyers with public comparison information vis-a-vis
other proposed or proprietary products.

Notes:
HEPLAR was chosen as a cost reduction measure: you save a bit over 5 MCr
of raw price (3.something with QSDS multiplier) with HEPLAR and a larger
powerplant versus Thrusters.  On the other hand, there are slightly more
capabilities in some areas than purely necessary (Improved sensor and
commo gear, and 2 standard laser turrets).  Unless the ship will be operated
on purely internal runs, those extras are worth it, and Far Traders are
most likely to make their profits on the fringe.  40 G-hrs is enough
for realistic maneuver needs.

This one isn\'t *quite* up there with "big rocks", but almost! <g>

I think the general consensus is that most trade is carried on *big*
freighters. I think the argument was just how big. 

The 200 ton\'ers are the "tramps" of the Imperium.  They work for scraps on
the main runs, carry "special" cargos, exist on spec trade (or smuggling),
and are continiously being pushed further out onto the fringes.

The only place they make economic sense is on the fringes.  Out there, they
can open up trade routes, carry the small amounts of cargo available as
trade grows, and make a few credits before the mega-corps notice and take
over.  Then the little ships just move further out, and start all over
again.

Here\'s something I\'m going to try in my game.  You can add this 
to my original post.  What do you guys think?

Page 57 (Rule Modification):  Here\'s a nifty little rule that I pulled
out of the Azhanti High Lightning Rule Booklet.  I have a problem with
the automatic unconsciouness brought on by a stat going to zero.  I
think that there should be some sort of a check, especially in the
case of Minor wounds.  The rule of page 12 of AHL suits this need
perfectly.

At the bottom of page 57 in the T4 rule book, make a note of the check
involved when one or two stats go to zero.  
 For a Minor wound, roll 1 D6.  Any roll of 2+ indicates that the
 character remains conscious and the zeroed stat is returned to a
 value of 1.

Use the extra points of damage (that carried over to the other two
remaining physical stats) as a negative DM on this throw.  For
example, a character has Str 2, Dex 3, and End 4 when he is hit with 1
D6 of damage doing 6 points.  The player chooses his End to take the
bulk of the damage, but because a whole die must be applied to one
attribute, there are 2 points of damage left over.  The player decides
to take these additional 2 points of damage on his Dex, reducing it to
1, and when the unconsciousness roll is made, a -2 DM is applied to
the throw.

 For a Serious wound, roll 1 D6.  A 6 is needed for the character to
 maintain consciouness.

If either of these rolls are made, the zeroed stats are returned to a
value of 1.  If the throws are failed, then follow normal
unconsciouness rules.

Kenneth.

Yeah, I made up some 1d3 and it\'s better now, but I still don\'t really like
them a lot.  I mostly use the 1d3\'s in character
generation, and as half difficulty levels now.

I proposed 1d6:Easy, 2D6:Simple, 3D6:Average, 4D6:Difficult,
5D6:Formidable, and 6d6:Impossible, but you\'re right about the crits.  What
I did about that was to have the GM pick up all the sixes rolled and reroll
them.  On the second roll 2 or more sixes are some sort of critical
failure.  Exceptional successes, I\'ve left as exactly two ones (not 2 or
more).

Well, not officially, I guess they don\'t.  That hasn\'t stopped me, though. 
<g> I include a time in tasks, if the PC rushes (.5xtime) the task gets one
level harder, if the PC takes his time (2xtime) the task gets one level
easier.  

> 5) Stats became more imoportant than skill, and easier to acquire.

That\'s why I introduced the idea of skill aptitudes (-1, 0, or 1) for each
skill.  The skill increases by 1d3+aptitude each time you get it.  The
average increase is 2, but it can range from 0 (I know some folks don\'t
like that, but a wasted chance is all too realistic) to 4.  This makes the
skill more important.  Of course, the target numbers get too big this way
unless you use full dice for each skill level.

Yeah, I proposed a "fix" to that too.  <g> During play the player puts a
check next to each skill they succeed in using.  At the end of a session
the GM awards players X number of skill attempts based on play (don\'t give
too many), these can be free choices or
designated skills.  The PC will go up one skill point if he *fails* a
Difficult Task against his current skill level in that skill. (What you\'re
trying to do is roll 4D6>=Current_Skill.  Low Skills improve easily, high
Skills don\'t.)

Why?  Having played primarily d% or d20 games, I find it novel, but have
yet to playtest it.  Give me another week...

As above.  Which fix?

I don\'t find this a weakness.  I tend to TLAR/SWAG it based on PC skill,
success level, and task.  I find specified task times to be inane, stupid,
unrealistic, and restrictive.  The MT attempt at it was laughable.  What\'s
the point of rolling for 3d6 (or whatever) seconds?  This is roleplaying,
and if it\'s in the ball-park (outside of life and death combat), it\'s close
enough for us...  A couple hours here or there for various things doesn\'t
change much.  When I don\'t have the experience relevant to the task, we
discuss it, or I guess.  ;-)

> 5) Stats became more imoportant than skill, and easier to acquire.

How\'d you figure that?  I can see the "more-important-than" argument, but
easier to acquire?  I guess we can argue nature v. nurture, or natural
ability v. training all day...  But let\'s not and say we did.  Heh. 
Needless to say, I tend to lean toward the genetic-tendencies side, with
the caveat that with the devotion and drive to train anyone can surpass
mere natural ability.

How\'s that?  I find it very realistic.  Most folks, even highly ambitious
ones, after their "formal" education is over don\'t do much to improve
themselves...  And developing any REAL level of ability in a skill requires
far more time than Traveller/adventurers will have whilst world hopping... 
The odd week in j-space won\'t cut it if you really want to become a
world-class fencer; that takes years of training.  I\'m going to school
full-time, and working two jobs, plus writing several different books that
I\'m behind schedule on, so...  I think I\'m probably not picking up that
graduate-level statistics skill right now that I\'m supposed to be while I\'m
reading the TML, eh?  Traveller skill levels reflect more than just mere
"experience or familiarity" that most games reflect; after all, FOUR levels
in medical is an M.D.  That\'s where the level-0 skills come in...  Anybody
that\'s watched too many episodes of GI Joe can pick up an autorifle and
give it a go...

As for being consistent with the generation process: does it reflect about
one new skill level every year, as generation does, if the PC spends the
time?  If so, then just have your PCs roll on the appropriate table...

to reflect pre virus automation, but I think a little tweaking could still be 
done...it seems strange that one guy can run the jdrive, mdrive and pplant 
combined, but it would have taken 4 to say "Hailing frequencies open" <g>
Either these numbers reflect an Imperial Workfare program for indigent
electronics specialists, or Uhura should have been making a lot more money.

Which brings me back to my original question, Assuming a crew of two 
minimum to fill in all these jobs, How much are we paying them as far
as calculating costs for the THUDDD is concerned?

Actually, from what I understand he was planning on having the little
rodents get onboard anyways, and this was merely an excellent excuse to
avoid having to deal with the (already established) overzealousness of FSY
products.  To further rationalize things, we can also say that it is a
newly-discovered bug in the FSY intruder-defense system (probably related
to the band it uses to communicate with the local FSY dealer when one goes
off in a starport, say, but I\'m not bitter or anything) which will
immediately be fixed.  After all, can\'t have anyone ELSE hijacking FSY
products (expensive as they are!) once we\'ve managed the trick, can we?

Also, I will point out that I STRENUOUSLY objected to him mentioning the
word \'virus\' anywhere near the list, FYI.

I see no reason why not (and if you\'re in a hurry, it should make the 
calculations easier), but remember that you can enter jumpspace from 
anywhere, but you always come out at least 100d from the nearest world (so 
if you did a \'null jump\' at 10d, you\'d be kicked out at 100d).

See above. Also, if you only fit 2 w/s, you can never use more than 2 crew

        Sure.  The thing is is that a) the anti-hijack programs on both
ships were both from the same manufacturer (Famille Spofulam, in case you

that I\'m currently pondering all the ramifications of their actions,
something which certain of their number don\'t seem to do :).

That had better be a really large stateroom...you have something like 7 or
8 people living in it ;-)

Also...the design sequence you have there doesn\'t add up. The actual costs
there add up to 101 MCr, not 89.7, and there isn\'t anything listed for the
powerplant. Using QSDS 1.5, 275 Mw of powerplant uses another 9.8 of
volume, costs an additional 27.5 mCr, and needs 2.8 dT volume for fuel.
This raises the costs to 128.52 MCr, or 96.4 MCr with the QSDS discount,
and lowers your cargo capacity to just over 40 tons.

    'body' => 'I\'ve been trying to figure out why there were such disparities between
designs like the YugoBox and the other Far Trader designs floating around,
which mostly seem to be done using SSDS, and I think I found it. QSDS
Hulls include redundant and uneccesary contragrav systems for ships with
thruster plates, at a significant cost in power, volume and money.

I just put together the YugoBox freighter, using SSDS (the .pdf version
from Joe Heck\'s web site, dated December something 1996) and came up with
some interesting things.

This is an all TL 12 ship (except for a TL -11 jump2 drive from ssds, not
jump 3 which is TL12) with no armor, minimal crew requirements, fuel
scooping and purification, and maximum cargo space. (the usp and other
details have been omitted, for all intents and purposes they are identical
except for the things noted below) 

System	Cargo dT	Power Req (Installed)	Cost (after discount)
QSDS	115.5		128 (130)		77.1 (57.8)
SSDS	110		81 (100)		62.04 (55.8)

the SSDS ship has a power requirement only 63% of the QSDS design, cost\'s
less by 20% in the raw state, and about  3% after discounts have been
applied. It does end up with a slightly lower cargo space for some reason,
though, and due to the economics, STILL won\'t make it\'s money hauling
standard freight.

I guess my big question is where is all that power going in the QSDS
system? With my SSDS design, the YugoBox has some 25% extra power
capacity (19 MW), enough to easily run a laser or two, wheras the QSDS
design has less than 2 MW excess.

My guess is the \'hull\' in QSDS, which includes "life support, controls,
airlocks, cargo hatches, artificial gravity, inertial comp, and CG
- -lifters". Why, if you have a thruster plate drive, do you need CG
lifters? Do thruster plates NOT provide hover and maneuver capability,
only thrust in a single vector? This is not so according to SSDS
"Contra-Gravity...They are included here so that ships below tech level 11
(Thuster Plates) can hover and maneuver in an atmosphere" 

For a 200 Ton ship, you need 2000 tons contragrav. By SSDS this costs:

Mass	Volume	Area	Power	Price
53.3	66.7	40	40	2.67

This puts the SSDS equivalent version of the YugoBox at a power
requirement of 120 MW, much closer to the QSDS version, the prices become
closer, and the SSDS has 4 fewer dT of cargo space. 

QSDS, at leats version 2 needs to look at this...maybe a TL difference in
the Hulls table.

With this fix in the QSDS ship, the Yugobox has > 120 dT of cargo space,
and costs slightly less due to lower hull costs, and lower powerplant
requirements. You STILL can\'t break even hauling standard freight, but
you\'re over 10,000 Cr closer.

    'body' => 'Good morning
In researching for the SSDS calss tonight i found out that alot of
people have problems figuring out armour.  Indeed "Starships is somewhat
vauge about this, this is because something was ommited from the book,
and that is armour toughness.

I remebered something about this from FF&S, multiply the number of
centimeters of hull thickness times the toughness rating to get the
armour value.

In SSDS i believe you take this number and use the USP conversion chart
to get the T4 armour.  This would explain why the 200Td box in
QSDS(remeber QSDS is SSDS "Package Deals")would have an armour rate of
0.T3\'s FF&S values are different from the ones in CSC.  I am assuming
that CSC is the most up to date so I will use the toughness ratings from
that system for SSDS.  Also note that in CSC the armour values are not
linear, there is a chart provided on page 56.  Using our example for
tonight. 1cm of TL-12 superdense takes up .77m^3 masses 11.55tonnes and
has a armour value of 1cm x 11toughness or 11 v. personal weapons and a
USP(ship weapon) value of 0.  To find the thickness for starships , whos
rate most often excededs 5,  devide the rate by 6 and use the thickness
chart.

Yes this way we can figure just haw many shots from a 9mm it would take
to kill the hull, a laser will rip right through it.

lets say we want this ship to have a armour rate of 2(USP). On the chart
2 is equal to at least 40 toughness.  40/6 is 6.67cm thick of armour. 
so we must multiply the volume of 1cm for the hull (.77m^3) times 6.67
to get a grand total of 5.14m^3 and a mass of (x15) 77tonnes.

Most of you may already know thins if you have CSC it is all on page
56.  I just wanted to clarify this before i started spouting it at the
class tonight.  Personaly i think this page should have been included in
the starships book, amoung other things. :)

Check out the new version of 3G3 for Greg Porter\'s take on some of these
ideas.. they\'re close to yours, but a little different.

I\'ll be posting some varient combat rules to my web pages in the near future
so I\'ll also address some of the problems with T4 combat.

I just received my copies of Milieu Zero and First Survey from Imperium

deckplans.

First Survey looks good, with statistics on the sectors for both players
and referees.  I didn\'t see the original Atlas of the Imperium, so I
can\'t comment on format for it.  But First Survey has a couple pages of
text, then statistics on 9 of the twelve sectors in the region of Core
(three have deliberately been made "GM preserves" - GMs can do as they
wish.) . The book then goes on to give the stats the players should see
along with a map of the sector.  After the player\'s version of the sector
is presented, the complete stats for the referees are given (given, it
looks like, in the old DGP format, with PGB and star types included).

As far as I know A ship that engages it\'s jump drive is in jump for a week
regardless of the distances jump. If distance mattered than a Ship with J-3
did a Single parsec jump it whould only take 1/3 a week.
But as long as you plot your course Corectly you will still go were you want
to.
And the week in jump will give you some time to repair damage inside the ship

Not impossible but
If the ship was in combat any number of things can go wrong with Jumping out.

A few thing that come to mind are. Ok I know that combat ships are built more
Robustly and can have there Hull grids beat on servely. But a I don\'t know if
a Civ ship can take this type of punisment but sinces the prices are the same
it should be able to?? But any sections of the grid that are missing will let
the Jump field into the ship. That is a VERY BAD IDEA TO TOUCH. And if the
fuel tank are hit you can kiss the hole idea goodbye Thats all that I can
give ya Hope it helps some

Note that small truckers *can* make a profit. They just haul "small
lots". Any sort of bulk materials go by rail or ship. Ditto for large
shipments. But smaller lots (one or two containers worth) tend to go by
truck, or (for overseas shipping) by getting the container (trailer)
slipped into a free slot on a ship heading in the right direction.

The real money for small carriers is in carrying stuff to the smaller
cities/ports. The places that don\'t get enough shipping to *support*
big freighters or rail lines. 

The other way to make money with small ships is the FedEx model. It\'s
not that you are *cheap*, it\'s that you can get it there *fast*.

Special cargoes don\'t have to be adventures. They can, however,
position you for adventures. 

To use a modern example, if a trucker contracts to carry a load to one
of the small towns in Central Oregon, he\'s going to charge you a lot
extra because the odds are he\'ll have to "deadhead" back with an empty
trailer. If you *can* arrange a return cargo, that\'ll lower the price.
But only if it\'s guaranteed and worth his while.

The same goes for the owner of a small ship hired to haul a odd lot
cargo to some obscure port. You pay extra for the lack of a return
cargo.

Of course, the standard contract for such will be written so that the
hauler gets to keep the "deadhead" fee even if he *does* locate a
return cargo. :-)

5000 ton sounds a bit small. And "specialized" bulk haulers *will* be
cheaper. Modern equivalents: grain ships and barges. Oil tankers, LNG
tankers, sulfur tankers, some ore carriers.

And big containerized cargo ships make a difference too.

If you\'re scooping from a small Gas Giant it will take you roughly that long
to get out to the jump limit, so the fuel processing time won\'t add more
than a few hours. If you scoop from a large Gas Giant it won\'t add anything.
The problem is the time it takes you to get from the mainworld to the Gas
Giant. Unless the mainworld is a moon of the Gas Giant the time you lose 
will cost you far more than you gain because you won\'t be able to make your
25 jumps per year. So the true fuel cost is Cr100/T because you\'ll buy
unrefined fuel at the starport and refine it yourself. And that will take
place while you are sitting on the tarmac waiting for those !@#$%^&*()
suppliers to deliver your cargo, so you don\'t actually need more than a
125Mw power plant.

No. But a regular freighter can. If you jump steadily between two adjacent 
worlds and have regular freight contracts with shippers on each world so
that you can count on, say, being 90% full on each trip and on the freight
actually being ready to load when you arrive on the planet, then you can 
do 35 jumps per year, putting you in the black.

I don\'t know about this... it seems like a pretty abusive interpretation of
the rules to me.  I think I\'d rule that a ship using a hundred 20 MW plants
instead of a single 2000 MW plant would actually require /more/ engineering
crew than the one with the larger plant, due to the need to constantly be
monitoring /every single flippin\' micro-plant/ to make sure they\'re all
operating at optimum efficiency, and all are operating in phase with each
other.  A power spike or drop at one could seriously throw off the
calibration of the entire set.  And if one is operating out of phase, even
a little, it would reduce the total output of the set.

OTOH, a ship with banks of microplants would have more online redundancy
than one with a single high power plant, and probably would be able to cope
with damage to one of its plants (or anything else affecting output). 
Maybe the En crew required should be based on the /total/ output of ALL
plants rather than the individual output of EACH.

Does this sound reasonable?  Anyone have other interpretations?

It isn\'t small ships in general that needs to be cheaper. A 200 T ship can
be profitable provided it can make 35 jumps per year, which is, IMO, 
perfectly reasonable for regular ships. Granted, they can\'t compete with
large ships, but that just means that they have to fit in between the
cracks. A large ship isn\'t profitable if the world it runs to dosen\'t
generate enough freight to fill its holds. So small regular freighters
and passenger liners are perfectly reasonable as long as they go to and 
from low and perhaps medium-population planets.

That dosen\'t help the typical PC-run Free Trader, of course, because the
Free Trader can\'t manage more than 25 jumps per year. So the ship\'s that
need to be cheaper are the PC-run ships. Now, take a look at this:

_________________________________________________________________________
|									|
| TRADERS! ARE YOU TIRED OF FRETTING AND SLAVING, DESPERATELY TRYING TO |
| MAKE THE PAYMENTS ON YOUR EXPENSIVE NEW SHIP?				|
|									|
| Take for example the captain who has bought a brand new Type A2 Far 	|
| Trader. He now has a ship capable of carrying 6 high or middle 	|
| passengers, 10 low passengers, and between 83.2 and 89.2 displacement |
| tons of cargo space, depending on the number of high passengers that  |
| take advantage of their 1 T of cargo space. The absolute maximum he   |
| can make per trip without a further investment in speculative trade   |
| is Cr159,200 per jump or Cr3,980,000 per year. His yearly expenses    |
| are salaries (ca. 192,000), life support (Cr525,000), maintenance     |
| (Cr49,800), fuel (Cr250,000), port fees (Cr2,500), and bank payments  |
| (Cr2,490,000). If he also wants a reasonable return on the MCr9.96 he |
| himself has invested, he has to earn another Cr622,500 (otherwise he  |
| would have been better off investing his money in someone else\'s 	|
| ship!). All this gives a grand total of Cr4,131,800 for a net loss of |
| Cr151,800. And this is provided the ship is filled 100% on each trip. |
|									|
| Fear not! Lupe Hole & Rool Lawyerz\' Used Starship Dealership has the  |
| answer!								|
| Buy an old ship! A 40 year old starship is worth only 25% of its 	|
| original price. Operating expenses are the same and the maintenance	|
| costs, risk of misjumps and risk of breakdowns are exactly the same!	|
| With a down payment of MCr2,49 you get a veritable money machine.     |
| Most expenses stay the same, but bank payments are reduced to 	|
| Cr622,500 per year. To get a decent return on your MCr2,49 all you    |
| need is to fill your ship about 45% on each trip. If you get anything |
| approaching 80-90% utilization you can save up for the down payment   |
| on another ship in a couple of years. Absolutely the best investment  |
| going! Don\'t delay! Invest before your neighbor catches on!		|
|_______________________________________________________________________|

OK, the problem with the above is of course that if a 40 year old ship isn\'t
worse in some way than a brand new one, why is it worth so much less? The
answer is that it IS worse. The risk of breakdowns are greater. A 40 year
old starship can make a lot of money PROVIDED nothing breaks down. If a
free trader is lucky he can make a lot of money. If he is unlucky his jump
drive will break down and maybe cost him enough in repairs to drive him into
bankruptcy.

So what we need are either detailed rules for malfunctions or a simple rule
that tells the Referee to impose a malfunction whenever the PCs gets too
much money...

Yes and no. You take the armor factor, use the USP (or is it USD) chart,
AND THEN you multiply the result by 10 to get the T4 USP armor rating.

Anyway, by this point we\'ve all seen that the classic freight-based far 
trader which hauls lots of cargo (for its size) and a few passengers is 
not profitable and never was.  Small passenger liners do fine, but 1,000 
Cr/ton doesn\'t work for small ships.

I see two answers: 

1) there are no freighters under 800 tons, the only small commercial 
ships carry passengers.

2) Cargo costs need to be changed

3) Bulk carriers have the freight trade all sewed up and small freighters
are left making a living on speculative trade.

IMHO 1 is dull, from what I\'ve heard here, nearly everyone else here loves
tramp freighter campaigns as much as I do.

2 could work if we go with the 4,000 Cr/ton found on page 97 of T4 the 
situation totally turns around.  Then again, at 4,000 a ship with a 40% 
full cargo hold is still paying expenses and making a handy profit.  If 
we want to change this I\'d go with 2,000 Cr/ton.  Higher than that will 
make it too easy on the PCs

3 is the way it stands now, and it does make some sense.  However, I\'d
also like some additions for freight too.  One rule I\'d like to see is
that the 1,000 Cr/ton only applies to cargo originating from a Class A, B
(and possibly C) starport.  As I see it, the bulk carriers control the
class A & B trade.  However, on the fringes many Class D starport may only
get merchant ships dropping by 4-6 times a year.  The 1,000 Cr/ton looks a
little unlikely at that point. 

If we want imperial trade mandates governing such trade, may be the rules 
could be:

1,000 Cr/ton for cargo originating at a Class A or B starport

1,500 Cr/ton at Class C Starports, and 2,000 Cr/ton at Class D starports

Do ships designed with SSDS get a discount? I thought only ships that were
100% QSDS qualified for discount as a modular "standard design"?

I went down to the local craft store (Michael\'s) and bought some 3/8"
(actually 10 cm) wooden cubes. Then I simply inked 1, 2 and 3 on them. They
roll fairly (as far as I can tell), they cost me something like 6 cents
each, and if I find a problem with the ink wearing off (I haven\'t so far)
I\'ll gesso, re-ink, and spray a clear coat over them.

Making my own means I can make up speciality dice, like the -1, 0, 1 dice I
use during character generation. Yes, I know those are fudge dice. <G>

I haven\'t see any character development but I do have to admit I have seen the shabbiest 
science in any science fiction series short of Lost in Space (crack in the singularity, yeah, 
right...)

And what is with the standing really close thing..everybody stands about a half a foot from 
someone they are talking to

But I digress, this is a Traveller list, not a slam the weeniest Trek yet list

Would anyone be interested in a history of the development of the Vargr Ueknou class 
corsair from TL 9 to TL F? (includes a design from each TL too!)

  Well, I\'ve been promising for a long time to post some rules for the
  conversion of High Guard USP\'s to T4 USP\'s.  The advantages to using
  High Guard (and Book 2) to design starships are:
  
  1) it\'s easier than any of the methods currently in print;
  
  2) you can actually easily design ships that are compatable in price
  and capability with the ships listed in the T4 rulebook.
  
  I\'ve been lobbying for a HG-like ship design system for nearly a year
  now. If you ever plan to resurrect High Guard (or anything like it),
  Marc, feel free to use this system or any system based on or inspired
  by it. It\'s all yours.
  
  These rules are not yet complete (two items have yet to be finished:
  meson screens and repulsers), but I figured I\'d go ahead and post what
  I had. Please, please, please send me lots of advice and criticism.
  
  Coming soon to a post near you: T4 USP\'s for:
          Type A Free Trader
          Type A2 Far Trader
          Type R Subsidized Merchant

  Converting from High Guard USP\'s to the new USP\'s in Marc Miller\'s
  Traveller.
  
TONS    ----
  
  The T4 tonnage is the same as the HG tonnage. Take the Tonnage USP
  value directly from the HG USP.
  
  For the hull type, use the following table to go from the HG
  configuration USP to the T4 USP:
  
  HG USP          T4 USP

  1               Needle/AF

  8               Planetoid/No SL
  9               Planetoid/No SL
  
VOLUME  ----
  
  Volume is equal to tonnage times 14. V = 14 * T.
  
COST IN MCR     ----
  
  Same for T4 as in HG.
  
CREW    ----
  
  Same for T4 as in HG.
  
PASSENGERS HIGH/MEDIUM  ----
  
  Same for T4 as in HG.
  
PASSENGERS LOW  ----
  
  Same for T4 as in HG.
  
CARGO   ----
  
  Should be listed in tons; same for T4 as in HG.  If you list it in
  cubic meters instead, then multiply the HG USP for cargo by 14 to get
  the T4 USP.
  
CONTROLS        ----
  
  For starships, Mil Std/Bridge. For small craft, Mil Std or Mil
  Std/Bridge if you include a small craft bridge. If the HG computer USP
  is A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H or J, then add "/fib" to the T4 USP.
  
TECH LEVEL      ----
  
  Same for T4 as in HG.
  
SIZE RATING     ----
  
  Use the table below to convert from the HG USP size rating to the T4
  USP:
  
  HG size USP     T4 size USP

  Same for T4 as in HG.
  
POWER PLANT RATING
  
  Same for T4 as in HG. To get the power plant rating in MW, multiply
  the power-plant USP by the ship\'s tonnage, and multiply that by 2.5.
  Power in MW = 2.5 * Tonnage * PP.
  
FIRE CONTROL RATING and SENSOR RATINGS
  
  I suggest getting these from the HG "computer" USP using the following

ARMOR   ----
  
  I show below two versions of HG-to-T4 armor conversion. The first is
  from the following official sources: HG to Striker, then Striker to
  FFS. But the conversion from HG to Striker, while official, is also
  very arbitrary. So I have substituted the arbitrary HG-Striker
  conversion with my own arbitrary and easy HG-T4 direct conversion.

That was one of the 5 "fixes" I have tried. Sorry, but I my feelings stand.
I will Never again use T4 for more than just a reference; I return to Mega.
My players want me to return to Mega, with a few fixes.

Again, my task-fix was put forward as a return to MT\'s basic concepts;
concepts I grew enamored with over years of Traveller:2300/2300AD and MT
GMing.

I feel it better to have surplus detail to drop than not enough detail and
having to wing it.

Then again, MT keeps showing up in used bookstores locally. Steady supply.
No DGP stuff is being traded to them, though... I wonder why? [NOT!!!]
Something I have yet to see from IG: Production Quality.

Both shows were linear plot through run, both were very high production
quality for their era, both were epic plots that are above and beyond the
scope I run RPG\'s in, especially traveller, and both have provided me with
tons of plot-inspirations for traveler adventures.

Yes, Kenneth, I do compare them; they both served the same niche in the
industry... different eras, but same niche.

BTW, did you know that every switch on the BG Bridge set did SOMETHING?
That set was a monster, according to everything I have read. Serveral
aritcles were published about how "realistic" the set was, including
inverviews: one of Terry somebody (Col Tigh), and another of the guy who
played the sensor chief.

One thing I have noticed about BG vs B5, ST, STTNG, DS9, and Voyager:
crewmen actually appear to make things happen on BG, even in the
background. On the others, they tend to look like they are just standing
around waiting for stuff to happen.

Method 1: double skill, half att: player rebleeion at division and

Method 2: 1.5/2/2.5/3/4/5 dice method: Still too easy, and CF became more
common.

Method 3: 1.5/2/3/4/5/6 dice method: same.

Method 4: Eris method: vetoed by general mention of the additional steps by
players.

Method 5: 2/3/4/6/8 dice method: Much worse than method 2, but finally hit
difficulties based upon exibited skill levels in the campaign.

CGen vs Play: the campaign covered 6 months real time, PC\'s aged 1.5 years,
all PC\'s gained 7+ levels during play, at 1-2 rolls per session, 3 if they
really impressed me. Most PC\'s had 2 or 3 attributes in the 10+ range, and
several had primary skills in excess of 8, at start!  Heck, I had a Scout
with Equestrian 4, and NO other non-ship/non-ship-crew skills.

CGen method used: 12d6 for attributes, place 2d per attribute after all 12d
rolled. Pick table, roll skill from table. Multiple careers allowed.
Background skills totally rolled.

Everyone quickly learned that Jack-O-A-T was the next best thing to
actually being skilled in EVERYTHING.

Everyone liked the new psionics system, and the additions I created worked
well. I\'ll re-post those if asked.

My group was not overly enamored with the new aging rules, but not overly
bothered. It would have been easier to hand them a table, but I was lazy. I
still prefer CT/MT aging.

1/2 Dice: Everyone in the group seemerd to think that they were a nuissance
at best. No-one strenuosuly objected to them, but all were unhappy with
them.

Combat System: the 3d limit is lame; it makes the average fire-fight with
.45 ACP, .454 Casul, and .357 mag all about the same; every gun larger than
a 357 will do limit to unarmored targets (the most common type). Makes
Rifels less intimidating, too. Again, I shall return to Mega, where a .22
can kill Mr FFF227 with a good enough hit, and a 357 will normally drop Joe
777777.

Pools: I can see the use for the pools, CT, MT, T4 all have pools of one
kind or another. I like Pools from T4, and like MT\'s Tactical pool. TNE has
the best Initiative system IMNSHO.

QSDS and SSDS: as the ammount of confusion grows on the list, and it
becomes discovered that they aren\'t as good as they first seemed, I point
out again that MT had an all-in-1 system for vehicles through starcraft.

T4 Ship Combat: Plain stinks. \'nuff said.

MM\'s Autograph: Second Best thing about T4, as far as I am concerned.

M0 and TL12 limit in the books: Well, T4 SHURE AIN\'T GENERIC ENOUGH. I had
to rely upon CT and MT sources for ships and equipment, as ships couldn\'t
be designed adequately for my needs with QSDS, and SSDS I found WORSE than
FF&S due to poor wordings and layout. The newer version shure looks
cleaner. But I still need up to TL 17 as a regular component... Yaskodray
didn\'t get ALL of his grandchildren in my campaings (Ahh, the fun I had
with Yaskodrits).

And overall, I feel the whole feel of the t4 amalgam is not to MY liking.
Except the new psionics. I\'ve tried T4, and it DID NOT WORK FOR ME. or my
player group.  I will await T5... and try to glean what usefull ideas I
find as long as I can from TC, DS, JTAS and TML.

Canon says that a J-0 uses precisely as much fuel as a J-1; for T4, 10% of
the ship volume.

Exactly.  How often does a business executive who needs to fly from LA to
Tokyo wander down to the airport and start haggling with second-string
air-freight operations who might have a spare seat?  High passengers as
Traveller defines the term will *always* ride scheduled, large liners.  I
mean, seriously:  If, for the same price, you can ride a nice comfy liner
for a week, or trust yourself to a crappy little freighter that smells
like old gym socks and has a crew that looks like they\'d be pirates if
they could afford a better laser...which would *you* choose?

Precisely!  Small traders have to find economic niches that aren\'t
serviced by either larger passenger or larger freight operations --
because going head-to-head against either, they\'ll lose bigtime.  You
don\'t see many tramp steamers hauling Toyota parts into LA, for example.
The small traders will make their money from:

People who...

1) Absolutely need to leave *right* *now*.
2) Prefer not to run up against \'officialdom\' on the trip.
3) Need to go somewhere the liners or other scheduled services don\'t go.
4) Want to have an \'adventure\'.

Cargo which...

1) Needs to leave *right* *now*.
2) Is illegal or must be sent covertly.
3) Needs to go somewhere the regular freighters don\'t go.

And that\'s about it.  There\'s not way in the world you\'re going to win in
a far trader doing jumps between settled, high-tech worlds with frequent
scheduled service as your competition.

If we want to (mostly) save canon economics in this regard, we can always
say that the prices given are what\'s typically paid for freight and
passengers meeting the conditions above.  In other words, High Passage on
a tramp far trader is 10,000, but on a 1000-ton scheduled liner it might
be 20,000.  Ditto for cargo, perhaps going to 2,000 on a scheduled
freighter.  The cost decrease is due to lack of in-flight service, safety
equipment, insurance, bonding, and so forth.  Since almost all PC ships
will be in this category, this does minimal violence to cannon while
explaining how tramp traders ever get a passenger or ton of cargo on milk
runs.

Of course, it\'s still the case that tramp traders will do far better
looking for special/speculative cargoes and particularly desperate
passengers, and by getting off the beaten path (read: adventure hooks),
but at least this way ships can reasonably expect to continue making
payments on the ship and keep hydrogen in the tanks while traversing
civilized space.

The rules are heavily slanted toward what PCs will encounter.  I think you
could drop in my rules mod above without breaking the quietly underlying
\'real\' trade economics.

        This idea has some good points and some bad points.  The bad points
would be that when devices are wired in series and you lose one then they
all go down.  Remember those annoying strings of Christmas lights where one
light goes out and they all go out?  I would hate to be the engineer that
has to go through a hundred power plants to find the faulty one.  You could
get around this by wiring them in parallel.  Another consideration would be
the loss of  power from voltage drop for every device that you send power
through.  If you have the first power plant  providing power to the second
plant and the second providing power to the third and so on  then you would
lose power through each power plant due to resistance. However  I may be
mistaken about this in this.  Also due to the need for additional cable
connections, safety interlocks, controls and other protective devices I
would believe that the total cost and volume of the system should be more
than a single large power plant.
        A good point is that quick repairs for a parallel wired power system
would be easier.  If one power plant is damaged during battle then that
power plant could be repaired while the others continue to power the ship.
I would believe that in the future systems would be modular construction.  I
once saw a program where military tanks and attack helicopters use a modular
electronics system.  If one system is damaged a box is removed and another
replaced.  That was several years ago so I could be mistaken about that also. 
        The old hermit will now reenter his small hovel, please pay no
attention to his ramblings.

  Whilst working on my StarShip Assembly line program (see the other 
message from me), and designing my THUDD entry, I came across a couple
of problems.

  On page 74, the calculation of engineers for drives mentions using both
mass and volume for the base figure. Which of these should it be? My
preference would be for volume, as this is much smaller than the mass.

  The table of Fuel Purification Plants (TL12) starts at a 20 displacement
ton monster. For your average Far Trader this is uneconomical. Are there
any restraints to us coming up with a smaller version, say 5 or 10 ton,
based on the original FFS formulae and calling this an SSDS component also?

Transcribo from notepad to computer.  That\'s 8 small staterooms
for the Crew (as the cost and tons indicate, if you check...)

Powerplant was another transcribo.  I left the line with the
(as you surmised) 275MW powerplant out when typing it in.
That line is:
	Power: 275MW (200+75), 9.8T, MCr27.5, 2.9T fuel, 0.3 crew
It *was* properly taken into account in the cost and tonnage
totals, was just left off the transcribed version.

However, re-running the other calculations three times now, I appear
to have the right volumes and costs.  For costs, I get
	8.8+25.2+0.1+9.2+7.4+0.3+2.8+27.5+0.014+0.42+1.0 = 82.734
For tons used:
	6+40+1+5+1.7+0.3+0.0+6+9.8+2.9+3.5+20+40+53 = 189.2
out of 189.6 useful for the hull type.  (oh, and a 0.4 ton ships
locker... which is also on the on-paper design sheet ;-)

I\'ve been known to make mistakes, and may still have one in the
above design.  However, and I\'ve re-run the numbers three more times
today after doing them twice last night, every time I do it it comes
out the same.  I used to do this for real with ships (I have a BS in,
no joke, Naval Architecture... my Senior Thesis project was a 4300 TEU
containership design) and I\'m a practicing aerospace engineer
doing real life launch vehicle and spacecraft designs...
I learned the hard way how to check my own work, and I think
this time it\'s right.  If not, please point out exaxtly where
you find the errors it in the above...  If there\'s an error,
it\'s going right past me, and I want to know why.

The prize for finding one (real one, not just the third thing
I may have transcribed wrong) is a free dinner and drink if you
ever are in Berkeley.  8-)

    I don\'t think anyone has figured this out yet, but... this is EXACTLY what
would be happening in the Imperium in Year 0.  In effect we are creating the
lesser known aspects of that Mileu\'s history. ;) And if this isn\'t part of what
TML exists for... then what does it exist for?  To talk up Bab 5?  Star Wars??
Star Trek???  I love these show but they are not Traveller, and I\'ve seen a lot
of messages about them.
    I\'m not upset about those posts but I think we should remember we\'ll have
to cover a LOT of territory here to over all the potential aspects of
Traveller. ;)

    Same here.  I\'m not all that terribly interested in designing ships, but
all the potential stuff around it makes for a wonderful seedbed for adventure!

A new spaceline, Echo Spacelines, is planning to start commercial
operations in the near future in many areas of the First Empire and
surrounding space.  Echo intends to offer reduced-rate interstellar
travel to the public, pending Imperial approval of the variant commercial
rate schedules.  Approval is expected by the end of Year 0 and operations
should commence in mid-Year 1.

The president of Echo, Magid Tamran, summed up the business philosophy
with the following statement: "No frills interstellar transport at
prices the average citizen can afford.   Everyone is stuck with this
idea that everyone who\'s traveling needs the standard amenities and
can afford the standard prices.  We want to provide everyone, not just
the rich, government, and business executives with adequate and safe
availabilities to travel from world to world.  It won\'t be as comfortable
as a standard liner, but we will get you there for less than your average
annual salary like the other guys want to charge.  And not just to worlds
lucky enough to be on mains, our ships will reach out 2 parsecs to the
rest of you, not just the lucky few."

Echo Spacelines preliminarily plans on using the soon-to-be-unveiled
Tammuz-Karst TK-109 light transport in a mixed-class liner configuration
with 20 small and 4 standard staterooms.  Echo is considering all-passenger
models of other starship varieties as well and is expected to request bids
for at least 20 starships by the end of the year.  Other shipyards and
architects are invited to tender bids per the specifications attached.

The preliminary rate schedule proposed by Echo is:
Echo Class (std stateroom+2m^3 luggage):
Single Occupancy	Cr9,000
Single Occupancy (sdby)	Cr8,000
Double Occupancy	Cr6,000
Triple Occupancy	Cr5,000
Quadruple Occupancy	Cr4,500

Tourist Class (sm stateroom+1m^3 luggage):
Single Occupancy	Cr6,000
Double Occupancy	Cr4,500

Yes, I\'ve got to admit, I received a copy of each as well today.  I cringed 
when I saw the error.  It was my deckplan that got omitted. 
It was definitely submitted to the ancien regime.  What they did

Scott glosses over 1st Survey a little bit.  Essentially 1st survey 
fills in the same 9 sectors from player AND referee perspective.  The 
referee maps are complete, the players left with incomplete 
information, in many cases.  BTW, 3 of the 12 interior sectors are 
left blank, intentionally to be undeveloped by IG for referee\'s and 
players to run their own campaigns and detail as they see fit.  All 
worlds are named, for the referee, ALL UWP\'s are detailed for ALL 
worlds.

PLENITUDE OF NEW WORLDS CHALLENGES SKILLS OF PLANETARY MODELERS

This is not your father\'s solar system

* For release at 2:20 p.m. PST Thursday, February 13, in
conjunction with Douglas Lin\'s talk in a seminar on "New Worlds
and Old Worlds" at the AAAS meeting, Washington State Convention
Center, Seattle.

SEATTLE, WA -- About two years ago, astrophysicist Douglas Lin 
recalls, speaker after speaker at an astronomy meeting in Hawaii 
deplored the lack of convincing evidence for new planets outside
of our solar system. Lin then arose to state that making planets
is incredibly easy. Researchers weren\'t finding them, he said,
for a simple reason: Most young planets migrate into their parent
stars, which consume them.

     The civil audience pelted Lin with figurative tomatoes. But
a lot has changed in two years, and no one\'s hurling fruit now.

     Indeed, Lin and other theorists are straining to keep up
with the whirlwind of planetary discoveries that has blown
through astronomy since late 1995. They have stretched their
models of how such systems evolve to accommodate a startling
variety of planets, from ones with eccentric looping orbits to
"hot Jupiters" that practically skim the outer atmospheres of
their stars. Even the history of our own solar system -- heretofore
a peaceful scenario -- is undergoing new scrutiny.

     "Planets appear ubiquitous, and planetary systems are 
extremely diverse," says Lin, professor of astronomy and 
astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz. "But to 
form a system that looks like ours, or one that can support the 
existence of life, may be a rare event." Lin will give a status
report on the newly energized field of planetary-system modeling
on Thursday, February 13, during "Old Worlds and New Worlds," a
special two-day seminar at the AAAS meeting in Seattle.

     Lin launched his recent modeling efforts in October 1995
when Swiss astronomers announced the first of the new batch of
planets, called 51 Pegasi B. A team at UCSC\'s Lick Observatory,
led by UCSC alumnus Geoffrey Marcy, rapidly confirmed the planet.
>From the outset its very existence seemed impossible. The
Jupiter-sized object raced around its star once every four days,
at a distance just one-twentieth that of Earth from our Sun. How
could the planet, presumably a giant ball of gas, withstand this
blast-furnace orbit? More puzzling still, how did it get there at
all?

     Within a day of the announcement Lin, Peter Bodenheimer of 
UCSC, and Derek Richardson of the University of Toronto had their 
solution. The planet coalesced in a colder region of its star\'s
nebula, perhaps 100 times further away than it is today. Then, in
a million-year gravitational tug-of-war among the star, the
planet, and gas and dust in the rest of the disk, 51 Pegasi B
spiraled slowly but relentlessly toward the star. Finally, in the
model\'s biggest surprise, inward and outward forces on the
planet\'s orbit canceled each other out just before the star would
have devoured the planet. The team published its paper in Nature
on April 18, 1996.

     Lin\'s idea that infant planets can migrate either toward or 
away from their stars dates to the 1970s, but he doesn\'t hesitate
to call those initial concepts "wild speculations." If his new
model is correct, the truth is even weirder. "I never thought the
migration could stop, especially so close to the star," he says.
"That was a real shocker."

     Two other curious systems (70 Virginis and HD 114762) have 
large planets that swoop close to their stars and then out again, 
almost like huge comets. In a paper to appear in the
Astrophysical Journal, Lin and Shigeru Ida of the Tokyo Institute
of Technology suggest that each star may have possessed a massive
disk of gas and dust, spawning several large planets. Within a
few million years, the pernicious effects of gravity could have
perturbed the planets sufficiently to make their orbits cross.
Then, inevitable collisions created a single enormous object with
a bizarre orbital path.

     If this notion sounds vaguely familiar, it should: Immanuel 
Velikovsky proposed that similar events in our own solar system 
could explain certain oddities in the rotations and positions of 
planets. Velikovsky\'s 1950 book Worlds in Collision went way off 
the deep end, but Lin acknowledges that the basic premise has 
merit -- if not here, than elsewhere.

     "Dynamics among planets and within a planetary disk is a
very rich game," he says. For instance, our outer solar system is 
"marginally stable." If Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune each had the
same mass as Jupiter, their orbits might degenerate within a
billion years -- less than the Sun\'s lifetime -- and wreak havoc
throughout the entire system. "We are safe, but we are just
safe," Lin says. "It takes only subtle differences in initial
conditions to cause very diverse evolutionary paths."

     Edging further along this limb, Lin suggests that life most 
likely would arise in systems with single massive planets tucked 
close to their stars, like 51 Pegasi B. He envisions such planets
as the last in a succession of gas giants that migrate to their
fiery dooms, sweeping up any rocky terrestrial planets in their
paths. Then, according to his models, the gas and dust that
remains in the wake of the final planet spreads out, seeding a
second generation of earthlike bodies. With no gaseous titans
further out to disrupt them, these planets could settle into
stable orbits for billions of years. It\'s not out of the
question, Lin says, that such a chain of events marked our solar
system\'s childhood.

     This conjecture flatly counters a tenet in astronomy that 
earthlike planets form in the toasty conditions close to their
stars while gas giants dominate the frigid outer reaches, and
never the twain shall meet. "I\'m not a religious person," Lin
says, smiling. "I\'m willing to challenge any paradigm."

If IG permits (yo, Marc!) and you still have a copy, could you post
the file to the TML or place it on someone\'s Traveller homepage?
I\'d like to print it off for some local gaming stores for inclusion
with their sales.

Well, neither has hit Dallas, Texas yet but it sounds like IG has done
a good job on them.  I\'m looking forward to picking them up.

	Will is talking about his Traveller campaign
here & I wanted to share my experiences as a player in
this campaign.  I do this not to bore you with details
but to indicate that I\'ve played them all a lot lately
& that I think I can compare them well.

	We started out playing in September 1995, when 
we were playing TNE rules in the CT setting (1082). In 
early 1996 we switched over from playing TNE to using
MT rules but the campaign continued.  A few months later
some of the players retired and/or died, some of us 
rolled up new charecters & the campaign continued, but 
with a slightly different theme.  When T4 came out we
stopped the 1st campaign & started in on playing The 
Traveller Adventure using the T4 rules.  Partway through
this adventure several misjumps complicated the campaign,
which finally ended in Darrian space with the death of most
of the party.  In the past year & half plus I have been 
playing Traveller about 6 hours a week/every week & I think
I have a good understanding of TNE, MT, & T4 systems.  The T4 
skill system is broken, but is not unrepairable.  I do not think 
that I will bother to repair it however because I think 
that MT is better.
> 
> keep asking which task-system fixes I have tried with t4:
> Method 1: double skill, half att: player rebleeion at division and

	This is the system that I supported.  I don\'t see the problems
in simple multiplication & division but apparently it causes problems
for the math impaired. (Although why they can\'t simply do it once &
write the numbers on their charecter sheets I don\'t understand.

	Lets take a look at my player charecter Fred Grandy, who had:
a UPP of 8A8ED7-5 at the end of the campaign.  Ssome of his better skill
levels included:
		Fast Talk-6
		Pilot-5
		Perception-4	Streetwise-4
		Jack-of-all-Trades-3
		3 more skills at 3
		11 more skills at 2
		15 more skills at 1
		and 4 skills at level 0
(these totals do not include his Psi skills as that is yet another
problem)

	Let us suppose that Fred is trying an Impossible Fast Talk
attempt, a task involving Int & Fast Talk skill (or Edu & Fast Talk
if you try to baffle them with bull....) his target number is a 20 or
less. 

> Method 2: 1.5/2/2.5/3/4/5 dice method: Still too easy, and CF became more

	Fred needs to roll a 20 out of 30 no problem
> 
> Method 3: 1.5/2/3/4/5/6 dice method: same.
	
	This is a little harder 20 out of 36 but his chances are still
better than %0%

	This method has some potentail but seems more troble than necessary.

	This would require a roll of 20 out of 56 and is quite unlikely
to work.

	This is about the right level of difficulty, but the odds of Crit 
Failing are much too high.  The T4 rules say of Imposssible Tasks "Even
the fittest (asset F) best trained (skill 12) (Asset=27 charecters in
the
galaxy have trouble accomplishing deeds of this level."  On an 8d6 task
the
average roll will be a 28 and an asset 27 charecter will have about a
48%
chance of success (not counting Crit Fails).

	All these charecters were legitimately rolled up.  I was lucky
in charecter generation (UPP 8A8C76) & picked up a few points during 
charecter generation & 1 in play.  Since T4 has more rolls on the skill
tables & T4 charecters will end up with slightly better stats.  I do not
think that this is a _bad_ thing but the task system needs to take it
into account.

	Jack of all Trades seems a bit too powerfull in T4.  You
could create a totally cinematic MacGuiveresque charecter entirely
too easily by just concentrating on high stats & the Jack skill.

	The new Psionics system is very elegant & runs well.  I like
it but by not requireing skill rolls it makes Psionics too easy.

	T4 aging is better, CT/MT aging is too harsh.

	I did not mind them but if task difficulties are raised they become

	I agree, the 3 dice limit is too forgiving, unrealistic, & eliminates
the real world advantage big guns have in killing people.

	Yes TNE has the best initiative system, it is clear & work well.

	I would not go so far as to say it did not work but what I will say

	I am very attached to the Traveller background (especially the
CT setting), even though I find large portions of it very improbable. 
 I do not have any particular attachment to any set of rules.  I would
 be happy to play CT, MT, TNE, T4,Gurps Traveller,  2300AD rules,Fudge
 Traveller, White Wolf Traveller, HERO system Traveller, or even Call
 of Cthulhu Traveller.  Yes the T4 rules do work & they do some things
 well, but MegaTraveller did most all of them better.

	I think that a lot of people out there must be having a lot of
fun playing T4 & I\'m glad they are but I think that it is the _setting_
not the rules that make Traveller what it is.  I have had fun playing
games using systems I dislike, such as AD&D, but this fun has always
been _in_spite_of_ the rules & do to a good referee & players & not due 
to the rules.

I\'d say, send it to dave bullock for inclusion on IG\'s web site.  Should 
be no problem that way.

Hmm.  I don\'t have the book yet (maybe Monday, I hope!), but I do have 
the manuscript.  Although Terra appears in Marc\'s outline (and that is 
what we worked from in creating M0), and the Places section was assigned 
to Michael Barry, my manuscript doesn\'t include an entry for Terra.  
Please remember we finished this in early November, thus my memory lapse 
as to what happened.  I saved all the email I received about that 
project, but none of them mention leaving Terra out.  Hmm.  Michael is 
out of email contact (you may remember he made a post to that effect last 
month), so we can\'t ask him.  Maybe Andy (project leader for M0) will 
remember what happened.

Our current project is Pocket Empires.  Our 1996/97 product proposal 
hasn\'t been approved yet, so there\'s no way to say at this time which 
we\'ll be working on.

YugoShips PLC introduces their biggest effort ever: The Volga Pride class
of large containerized cargo ship. Destined for workhorse duty along the
Sylean Mains, this ship can carry almost 1200 standard 3dT Imperial
containers each trip, loading and offloading it\'s cargo rapidly though 70
cargo hatches per side. Designed with great care to maximize cargo space
and reduce crew requirements, the Volga Pride offers a high degree of
automation, enabling, for instance, the entire maneuver/jump drive systems
to be run by only 4 crew members, and a total crew complement of just 13.

Notes:  This is the biggest pure-cargo ship buildable by SSDS or QSDS
rules. This is an SSDS design. This one makes a profit of 1.62 Mcr/month
at full loading, with standard 1000kCr/dT cargo prices. It\'s still tight,
though. The ship has to run 23 jumps/year at 80% capacity to break
even...there\'s little margin for downtime with this one. But if it runs
all the time, and the cargo hold\'s full, it\'ll make you almost 16 Mcr/year
profit

What is the real life breakeven point for something like a modern
container ship, the closest thing I can think of to this design? Anyone
know?

That a ship this big needs to run so full so much of the time indicates to
me that the numbers for freight are just too low...maybe that 4000 cr/ton
figure in the T4 book is right!

A microjump still uses the same fuel it would in a regular jump (which we can

No, you don\'t have brain damage.  AFAIK, there were write ups on ALL
portions of the outline done although I worked on none of the sections
in question.  We worked off of Marc\'s outline, and indeed, a copy of
it still sits on my hard drive, somewhere.  AFAIK they were all
written, and submitted.  Beyond that, don\'t know with any certainty.

I have no idea who is working on Milieu 200.  Probably nobody at this
point.  I would imagine that information on Terra will probably pop up
there (It\'s a logical place for it), but I am just speculating. 
Currently, we are working, under the supervision of Tim Brown and Marc
Miller on Pocket Empires.

I use the "wear number" from T2K and T:TNE.  I break the ship down into the
major components (j-drive, hull, computer, etc.) and assign each a wear number.

Doing it this way, you can either get an average wear value, and discount
the ship based on that, or figure the wear-adjusted cost of each component
and refigure the total cost of the ship.

Technologies today announced that it was withdrawing from the ISBA.

"Simply put, we were streching ourselves too thin, and could not support the
Trans-C division in the way we had hoped.  GT will remain focused on our
weapons and individual equipment markets." said GT representative Caileigh
Gridlore.

Rumors abound that the withdrawl of GT was sparked by an incident at an
informal party held on Orbital Five, where Sir Arameth Gridlore and Hengabar
Spofulam nearly came to blows.  According to witnesses, the incident began
when Mr. Spofulam was speaking with an industry reporter, and Sir Arameth
forced his way into the conversation, accusing Spofulam of "nearly getting
us all killed" in an unspecified incident.

Station security quickly seperated the two industrialists.  When pressed for
an explanation, Sir Arameth had only the following comment:

"Hengabar and I go back a long way.  We might have been friends at one
point, but he knows why that can never be.  Ask him about Celetus, and what
happened there.  He won\'t answer you, but it will ruin his night.. maybe
give him some nightmares.. Gods know, he deserves them for what happened.."

Sir Arameth was then hustled out of the banquet hall by family members.

News of GTs withdrawl caused GT stock to rise 2.3 points on the Sylean
exchange.  One analyst, speaking off the record, said that the ship building
market is getting crowded, and predicted that several other smaller concerns
might follow Gridlore\'s lead.

**Role playing off**

As much as I liked the idea of the ISBA, my medical condition has worsened,
and I\'m now on some strong pain killers.  This makes designing Starships a
chore, and more trouble than it\'s worth.

I\'ll still be working on weapon designs, and adding to my web pages, but
trying to learn to use SSDS/QSDS while under the influence of vicodin just
isn\'t possible.

They make sense *inside* the Imperium too. There are always going to be
systems where it just doesn\'t *pay* to send a megafrieghter. That
research outpost with all of 12 people, or that TL3 world that can\'t
afford to import much because it can\'t produce much in the way of
exporets (quantity-wise. The stuff may be *hideouesly* valuable, but
but the total amount is too small).

Free traders are a combo of gypsy trucker, tramp freighter, and "bush

be around in even the developed areas, carrying stuff to the "small

Not a problem. A week later, most planets will have *easily* moved more
than 100 diameters. BTW, this is why doing a "blind jump" is a bad
idea. since everything in the universe is moving relative to everything
else, failing to calculate before engaging the drive can have you come
out *anywhere* within the jump distance you engaged for (ie if you used
fuel for J-1, anywhere within a parsec of your starting point).

Or, you can say that a "neutral jump" has you come out in "the same
place". But that needs to be modified by the motion of the planet (and
possibly the star). At an average of 30 km/sec, a week means 18 million
km, or about 1/8 of an AU. 

Oh yeagh, if you engage the drive at 10 diameters, don\'t forget that
gives a *large* chance for a misjump. It\'s even *possible* to engage
the drive on the ground. But the odds are little better than suicide
(anybody got them handy?)

Back in my University days I and another ref banged out house rules on how
jump drives operated. Our goals were to:

1. Describe the physics and mechanics of jump drive so that the players
knew what was reasonable and what was not, and so the referee could make
reasonable rulings on unusual circumstances.

2. Logically explain peculiarities in the Traveller rules (why does the
jump depend on volume but not mass? Why do they always take 1 week
regardless of distance jumped? Why don\'t they work close to planets when
there is gravity-canceling technology? Why do they need a human pilot to
plot jumps between locations that can be determined to arbitrary precision
computationally? How could the Annic Nova jump without fuel and with only a
tiny fraction of the energy supplied by fusing massive tonnage of
hydrogen?... the list goes on and on)

3. Provide lots of cool effects and anomalies the referee can use in campaigns.

I still have a writeup (it\'s about 3 pages) and I was planning to convert
it to HTML one of these days. If anyone\'s interested I could put it on my
web page, but it needs updating for T4. I will try to answer your questions
as they would apply in my campaign:

>1. It seems generally accepted that a ship creates a N-space bubble around
>itself before and during a jump.

Well, it creates an N-space bubble, but in J-space, not around itself.
There is already lots of N-space around itself before the jump so there is
no need to create more. J-space is another dimension different from
N-space.

>What, if anything, does such a thing look
>like (visually or through other sensing methods)?  Do the crew notice any
>differences when the bubble is formed?

Since we cannot look in the J direction for the same reason a 2-dimensional
creature cannot look into the third dimension, there is no way to detect
the bubble. The crew does notice tons of jump fuel being pumped into
nothingness and lots of energy appearing from nowhere.

>2. The actual act of entering J-space involves a massive burst of energy.
>What does an observer see when a ship enters J-space?  If a crewmember were
>looking out a viewport, what would they see?  Does the event affect the
>crew at all (sensations, etc.)?

The act of entering J-space involves a moderate amount of energy expended
over about 20 minutes, not a "massive burst". When there is no more fuel
being pumped and no more energy being generated the ship is ready to jump.
An observer may notice the ship generating a slightly higher amount of
waste heat than normal... and then appear to vanish in a puff of hydrogen
gas (plus traces of helium). High speed video of a jumping ship shows a
plane of murky red energy sweeping through the ship, intersecting the hull
along the jump grids. The plane swallows up the ship in front and emits
hydrogen gas in back. A crewmember looking out a viewport will see the
universe get replaced by a bunch of background IR. High speed video inside
the ship shows what appears to be an infinite plane of murky red energy
appear at one edge of the ship and swallow the entire universe up. They
feel no sensation at all since, from either viewer\'s frame of reference
they are not affected; it is the other ship/outside universe that
disappears. However, certain psionically gifted individuals have reported
"feeling something".

>3. Once in J-space, what, if anything, do crew looking out viewports see?
>What sort of sensor readings does the ship get?

Background radiation rapidly cooling toward absolute zero. Other than that,
Nothing. Not even empty space; Nothing.

>4. If energy or matter is introduced to the N-space-J-space boundary, what
>happens?  Could this endanger the jumping ship?

You\'d have to be quick! If someone outside the ship fired an object into
the plane of energy as it swallowed the ship it would probably get ejected
along with the hydrogen unless it was REALLY fast or large, then you\'d get
a bunch of subatomic particles along with the hydrogen. If someone inside
the ship threw an object into the plane it would get swallowed along with
the rest of the universe (from their frame of reference), though someone
outside the ship would see some some extra protons and neutrons along with
the hydrogen. It would not endanger the ship unless it was massive enough
to make the "N-space bubble" unstable. A hunk of neutronium would do. If
that is the case, see the next question.

>5. If for some reason the N-space bubble drops while in J-space, what happens?

The ship and everything aboard would turn into a cloud of unbound quarks.
These would reappear as a burst of subatomic particles at the ship\'s
original destination in one week. Yes, you are dead.

>6. When a ship re-enters N-space, what do observers (on and off the ship)

The reverse of what they saw in step 2; though without the hydrogen puff.
Again, each observer sees the other reappearing.

No. If you want to know who it is, you have to go out and look at them. We
considered making them identifiable, but decided this way was more fun.

Please, move the Voyager/Babylon5 OFF TML
<IMNSHO>
It is off topic, it is pure B_LLS__T AFAI care, and it take almost 50% of my
d/l time. It has it\'s place, yes, but it is of NO interest for myself, and
at least
the ISBA postings ARE Traveller topics.

<g> This IS NOT meant as a flame, just that complaining about bandwidth 
while holding an ongoing Star Trek conversation is a bit like the pot calling
the kettle black.

Maybe you\'d take into consideration that you\'d rather be on that little tramp
freighter when it pirates the liner you would have been riding...if it\'s crew is
anything like my players?

Here is a convention concerning rounding that I use:

2d6/3,dn   - means truncate (throw away fraction)
2d6/3,rd   - means round (.5+ rounds up, less than .5 rounds down) 2d6/3,up  
- - means go up to next whole number if there\'s any fraction

with ship designs, I guess), and I noticed the TL12 companion robot.  I
did some back of the envelope calculations, and it looks like such a robot
would cost on the order of 3,000 a month to purchase and maintain (if
financed along with a ship).

  Now, this is nothing to get excited about - gunners and medical
personel get paid less, though it is half the rate of a pilot.  The real
kicker is in life support and housing.  The life support for a crew member
is on the same order as salary - 50,000 per year for 25 jumps.  Robots run
on electricity, and Mr. Fusion Plant is churning that out.  Plus, the
cabin you were using for a person now can be cargo instead (for a cheaper
ship), or can carry a passenger and make money that way.

  The above makes the assumption that a standard ship\'s computer can
handle the computations - the Catalog is vague on the central computer
requirements to run companions.  

  Where this gets introduced first would likely depend on public reaction.
I\'d try out a steward if folks didn\'t mind too much - the robot is
available 24/7, compared to the sleep patterns of a human steward.  If
humans don\'t care for non-human care, I can easily see robot
communications officers and navigators, maybe even engineers.  I\'d assume
pilot might be last, since people might want a person to actually "fly"
the ship, even if the computer was doing most of the work.
 
  Anyway, I think Generica Shipyards is going to commision a research
project on the matter.  It might even make it possible to make Far Traders
profitable - perish the thought!

Well, here they are, the 28 ship designs from CT that I promised I
would convert to T4. This should give all interested parties some
basis for judging the HG-to-T4 conversion system I\'ve cooked up.

Disclaimer: I did not design any of these ships. The High-Guard and
Book-2 versions of these ships are all owned by Far Future Enterprises
(FFE).  These are all paraphrases of the original designs. The purpose
of this post is to demonstrate the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of
the HG-to-T4 conversion system that I posted here the other day. No
attempt is hereby made to challenge any trademarks of FFE.

I attempted to give credit to the original ship designers. Since I don\'t
have first-hand knowledge of who made these ships, my credits will no
doubt be wrong in some instances. Please forgive me.

Hmmm...so the Core Subsector has been altered, presumably back to what
it was before the T4 rulebook was printed...
        This will have interesting ramifications for my campaign,
        because I
am NOT going to just pretend that nothing happened. When my players
get back from their little jaunt to the Gushemege sector, they will
find everything...different.
        So guys, help me figure out (in story terms) what happened...

You have to be joking, the only thing I can think of is an imperial 
degree changing the names and locations of the Core and the capital.  
As for how systems physically moved I have no clue. Grandfather, a

JMS is only the first American.  I\'m told that several british shows have
had one writer do a whole season.

I just can\'t watch Trek any more now that I\'ve been exposed to B5 - plot
threads that get followed up on later (sometimes much later), non-perfect
characters, inter-character conflict, politics, I could go on.  Suffice it
to say that may standards have gone up.

Yes, actually, that\'s something I\'ve been on about ever since T4 was
released.  If you want 20 hours of fuel on a HEPlaR equipped ship, you have
to multiply the fuel values in QSDS 1.5 by 20.

HEPlaR can be fun to use in lower-tech craft, but at TL-12 (11? Which is
it?) you might as well use Thrusters.  They\'re more economical, because the
small amount of savings in the price of the ship is more than made up for
in the amount of volume you /aren\'t/ using for fuel and can therefore use
for cargo, passengers, weapons, etc.

Well, the unverise is defined as everyting (At least by one definition)
This would included both J-space and N-space, so the law of mass
conservation would still be valid as long as no mass vanished from the
sum
of the two dimensions.

At least that\'s how I\'d deal with it.

THUDDD Ballot

        Alright people, this is real simple.  For this THUDDD, I\'ve made an
executive decision to keep the voting straightforward.  Paul may of course
change things once he takes over.  You\'ve just got to fill in five numbers
for each ship.  Do not vote for your own design.  Ratings are from a scale
of 1 to 10, 10 being highest.  The categories are:

Overall: how do you rate the design overall?  You may take everything into
account.

Commercial Feasibility: how commercially feasible is the design?  How much
would you want to be trying to make money with this design?

Innovativeness: How cool is it?  Has the designer done anything really
nifto with it?

Roleplaying potential: How useful would this be in a campaign?  Do you
think it\'d be a fun ship to build a campaign around?

Freedom from glaring design errors and broken rules: How badly did the
designer screw up?  Here, perfect error freedom should rate a 10.  I
suggest being harsh on this one; miscalculating power plant requirements
like I did on the CDB-2 should be cause for having no mercy.


        You can add any comments (note; sound bite good: doctoral
dissertation bad) below the total line.

Crew Detail: Max Crew:4 (1 Pilot, 1 Navigator, 1 Engineer, 1 Sensor)
             Typical: 2 (1 Pilot/Navigator 1 Engineering/Electronics)


Here\'s my take on YugoBox economics:

Total cost:     57.8 MCr
Down Payment:   11.56 MCr

Monthly Mortgage:       0.241 MCr
Crew Salaries (2)       0.009
Life support            0.004
ann maintenance         0.005
Fuel                    0         that\'s why we have scoops! (even though,
at 3 dT/hour it\'ll take over 13 hours to purify a full fuel load...not
exactly quick getaway time!)

Total monthly           0.259 mCr

Cargo                   0.231  mCr/month
(2 trips / month 115.5 dT cargo, 1000Cr/dT)
Passengers              0.040 mCr/month
(2 trips/month 2 mid passengers each time, though this would be a rather
\'roughing it\' approach to star travel)

You can\'t break even. Not with just freight! With a full load of
passengers each trip, you only make about 10,000 credits profit a trip.
This wouldn\'t be economical at all, unless you could absolutely be sure of
filling your hold and spare staterooms each and every run.

If you just haul freight, with  a standard crew, or even a skeleton crew,
you\'re going to go broke.

TK-108 Far Trader

Tammuz-Karst is pleased to announce it has completed preliminary
design of the TK-108 Far Trader.  We believe this ship represents
the best reasonable balanced design to the general Far Trader
conceptual configuration.  We note, however, that following the
standard economic models for monthly gross and rate of return
indicates that the TK-108 will not be profitable.  This is a
generic problem with small jump-2 transports at the current
level of technology, not limited to the TK-108, and we feel
that innovative use of the ship and trading potential can give
useful profitable service from this and similar models.
Potential owners are cautioned however that they may well
face difficulties in this regard.

While certain detailed layout designs are being kept proprietary
at this time, the general specifications are being announced here
to provide buyers with public comparison information vis-a-vis
other proposed or proprietary products.

Crew detail: 1 engineer, 1 electronics, 2 maneuver, 2 gunners,
                1 command, 1 steward, 1 medical

Notes:
HEPLAR was chosen as a cost reduction measure: you save a bit over 5 MCr
of raw price (3.something with QSDS multiplier) with HEPLAR and a larger
powerplant versus Thrusters.  On the other hand, there are slightly more
capabilities in some areas than purely necessary (Improved sensor and
commo gear, and 2 standard laser turrets).  Unless the ship will be operated
on purely internal runs, those extras are worth it, and Far Traders are
most likely to make their profits on the fringe.  40 G-hrs is enough
for realistic maneuver needs.

you almost never run out and it\'s a pain (cf the BSDS discussions)]

Press Release: Imperial Day 47
The transRift Engineering Corporation is pleased to announce its first
offering to the citizens of Imperium space, the Greyhound-class Far Trader.
The Greyhound-class ships build on very successful tREC military and
civilian designs in widespread use throughout the Rifts. Under normal
operating conditions on the fringes of Imperial space with wilderness
refueling, the ship is well capable of operating at a profit for
live-aboard owner-operators. When operating in regions such as the Rifts,
where a premium can be charged for rapid transportation of passengers and
high-value cargo across the large distances, the Greyhound comes into its
own. With the installation of collapsible fuel tanks (at an initial cost of
only 6.4 MCr and loss of 2 Std of cargo space when not in use), the
Greyhound can travel four parsecs in two weeks compared to months of travel
required by the standard jump-1 bulk carriers.

The Greyhound is designed around the cost-effective tREC 200-Std superdense
needle airframe hull. The airframe design provides for maximum flexibility
and safety in planetary atmospheres including wilderness refueling. The
incorporation of passive armor provides the added measure of survivability
frequently needed in frontier operations. Although classified as middle
passage by Imperial regulations, the passenger accommodations are uniquely
designed to provide maximum comfort on extended journeys. Each passenger is
provided with a large private self-contained and soundproofed sleeping
module (fifty-percent larger than an Imperium standard bunk) fully equipped
with a variety of entertainment options which opens onto an unusually
spacious central common area. The luxuriously appointed common area and
galley (84 m^3) supported by the full-time steward and medic provide the
Greyhounds passengers with a level of service not normally encountered in
Imperial middle passage.

The Greyhound is laid out in a two deck design with the lower deck
dedicated to cargo. The ships bridge is located in the nose with the pilots
and navigators cabins directly adjacent. Aft of the control section is the
passenger area. The bunk room for the remainder of the crew, the laser
turret, and the engine rooms are located in the ships tail.

Notes

Catullus unveils its first public starship design. This is based on a
custom design made for a Hazan based pilot who wanted a basic ship for a
courier run. As such we recommend that the ship be used as an owner/operator
affair. This is because the profit per trip is 13KCr given a full load of
passengers and cargo.

A number of our trademark design features have been included in this design.
Highly automated dynamic controls are used throughout the Spendthrift class
starship. This means that we have been able to make a design in which the
ships systems can be managed entirely from the bridge. Catullus does,
however, recommend that the Spendthrift class starship, like any other, not
be run without some knowledge of ship\'s engineering.

Along with the low crew requirements we have provided a secure design
incorporating separation of passengers to the middle, larger deck; advanced
anti-hijacking facilities and programs; and secure passageways between the
upper operational areas and the lower engineering deck. A large stateroom
is provided on the middle deck for each passenger. A small stateroom is
provided for each crew member on the upper deck.

Description:
        The Generica Shipyards Type 3726 Far Trader is designed for
operations at or beyond the boundaries of the Imperium involving freight
transport for speculation.  Redundant power  and weapons systems allow
prolonged operations without access to shop facilities.  In particular,
the power plant is considerably oversized, allowing upgrades to other
systems without major refit, and continued safe operation despite minor
power supply degradation.  The fuel purification system ensures safe
operations in regions without port facilities.
        Built using standard Sylea Industry Norm (SIN) components, the
Type 3726 offers excellent performance without high cost.  Custom options
in terms of included components are facilitated by prefabricated modules
designed to fit the hull without internal modifications.  Please consult
with Generica about design options.
        One large stateroom is provided for the Owner/Operator or Pilot,
with meeting space for private conferences with clients.  The other five
crewmembers are housed in standard small staterooms.  Two of these
staterooms is located next to the maneuver crewstations to allow rapid
response in emergency.  Three large and seven small staterooms are located
in a separate area for passengers.  An emergency low berth is provided in
the cargo area to allow transport of large animals or to hold passengers
injured or taken ill during flight.  Imperial regulations do not allow the
regular transport of paying passengers in such berths, so these berths are
not included in the standard economics statement included with this
catalog description.
        Cargo space is allocated in one large bay, centrally located.
Holddowns are provided for the standard 4 ton enclosed air raft, which is
included in the ships purchase price.  The air raft serves as an approved
escape vehicle, and also provides the crew with on-world transport,
enhancing trading opportunities.
        The Type 3726 is not designed for regular freight service within
Imperial boundaries, as standard Imperial passenger and freight rates do
not allow profitable operation.  Rather, it is designed for the flexible
transport of urgent cargoes on a speculative basis.  Customers interested
in ships for service inside the Imperium are referred to Generica
Shipyards Types 2461 through 2547 or Types 3411 through 3609.

****Roleplaying Off:
        As is probably obvious, this is a fairly faithful duplication of
the Far Trader from Classic Traveller.  The only changes are the
substitution of several small staterooms for the large ones in the
original - an exact duplication of the CT design has even worse economics
than this ship.  The decision to allocate 3 large and 7 small staterooms
to this space is based on the passenger generation tables in the T4
rulebook - you usually get about twice as many mid passengers as high.
        The large crew (six in all) for such a small ship is deliberate;
it allows space for player characters, as well as an NPC or two if the
group is small.  In economic terms it makes less sense, but who cares?
        Notice that the two cabins mentioned as being next to the bridge
are the ones noted in the CT design as being used by greedy owners to
enhance profits.  By hot bunking the crew, two additional middle
passengers can be carried.  Combine this with scooping fuel, and you can
break even, just about.
        It is possible to build a Far Trader that will make money, at
least theoretically, but they tend not to be much fun for player
characters.  The addition of four or more middle passenger cabins to this
design would make it theoretically profitable, though the passenger spaces
would likely be filled only if the ship was serving high pop (8+) worlds.

Notes:
        New Victoria Naval Architects LIC, announces their bid for
the THUDD Far Trader specification, the T-300 series. Capable of
jump-2, and carrying 12 high or middle passangers and 127 dspTons of
cargo, the T-300 meets all the basic demands of the civilian Far
Trader specification, as well as the requirements of the IISS
Communications Bureau for the carriage of Imperial Mail. As in all of
NVNA\'s designs, flexability is a key feature - an outsize power plant
provides for the addition of extra weapons or sensors, while the cargo
area can easily be reconfigured at any shipyard, allowing the vessel
to be customised to meet the needs of individual captains. Crew
spaces are also flexible, the three large and three small staterooms
providing adequete space for up to nine crew. As there is little need
for a full-time medic on a vessel with such a small number of
passangers, this position is often combined with that of the second
stewards, thus allowing the addition of a second gunner (for the
security conscious), or allowing the captain to have a large
stateroom to herself.
        In response to queries about the absence of a fuel
purification plant in the design, an NVNA spokesman replied that "the
T-300 was designed so that it could be constructed with components
straight out of the Imperial Standard Data Package. Unfortunately,
the ISDP fuel purifiers were vastly overrated for our needs, and the
addition of a stock model would have had an adverse effect on the
designs profitability". NVNA is understood to be lobbying the
Imperial Ministry of Technology for the addition of a smaller, 5
dspT / hour fuel purifier to the ISDP.


Revenue Breakdown:

                127 dspT cargo                         127 kCr
                61 dspT refined fuel @ 0.5 kCr        - 30.5 kCr
                Crew L/S                               - 9 kCr
                Total revenue per trip:                183.5 kCr

Per month:      Monthly payment                        288.3 kCr
                Maintenance fund                         5.8 kCr
                Crew salaries                         ~ 33 kCr
                Total expenses per month:            ~ 327.1 kCr

(Maximum) Revenue: 25 trips per year            4587.5 kCr
Expenses: 12 months                           - 3925.2 kCr
(Maximum) profit per year                        662.3 kCr

 Customisation of the vessel may reduce profitability; for example,
the addition of a standard ISDN fuel purifier reduces yearly profits
to ~100 kCr, making the margin for error much tighter. Note that the
design can break even at roughly 85 % of a full load. Acquiring an
Imperial mail service contract lowers this break-even point to ~78%,
and almost doubles the maximum yearly profit.

Crew Detail: Pilot, Astrogator, Engineer, Sensor Op, Steward/Gunner
             Steward, Medic

Notes:
The P-200AL is designed to be an affordable and economically viable long
range commercial starship. The P-200AL is constructed using standard
modular component, the P-200AL can be easily maintained by a large number
of dockyards throughout charted space. The P-200AL is intended to
concentrate on the carriage of passengers and smaller high value cargos,
rather than attempting to compete inefficently with larger bulk carriers.

The P-200AL is fitted with a standard Hughes HHS-4RY jump drive giving
it a range of 2 parsecs and carries 40 tons of jump fuel internally. The
P-200AL is fully streamlined permitting atmospheric operations and is
capable of wilderness refueling from gas giants or local oceans; and it\'s
onboard Mitre VML fuel purification plant permits a full load fuel to be
processed in 4 hours 10 minutes (at a throughput rate of 10 tons per hour).
In system maneuver is provided by two Zimm GTL-R7 gravitic thruster units.
Each unit provides up to 1,400 tons thrust giving a sustained acceleration
of 1G. Power for these and other onboard systems is provided by a coupled
pair of Simmens EG-R54/e 75Mw fusion reactors utilising the latest cold
fusion technology. The 1600 Kg of L-Hyd fuel dedicated to the reactors
provides for up to one year\'s continuous operation.

The P-200AL is fitted with a Matsui ASC-12 intergrated control, sensor
and communication package. This package meets all Imperial astrospace
regulations (including a regulation Imperial tamper proof ID transponder).
It includes regulation avionics, short ranged AEMS and PEMS sensors, a
3000km range radio and 1000AU range laser communicator. Any individual
component can be easily removed for maintaince or replacement.

The P-200AL comes with a standard Phoenix PL(C)-4 light laser cannon.
No dedicated gunner is provided for, but a work station is provided to
enable another crew member to operate the weapon should it prove nccessary.

The crew of seven are provided with one large stateroom for the Captain
and six small staterooms for the other crew members. The crew are provided
with communal sanitary and food preparation areas to maximise the amount
of space available in the individual staterooms.

Sixteen large passenger staterooms are provided along with 22 dTons of
dedicated cargo space. An insulated, sound proofed 2.4m false ceiling is
provided throughout the passenger areas, enabling unsightly machinery and
conduates to be hidden from view, greatly increasing passenger comfort.
Each passenger stateroom is provided with individual sanitary facilities
and a small galley. However more extensive food preparation and dining
facilities are provided in the common areas, enabling the shared commaradarie
that provides much of the romance of space travel. The standard crew list
provides for two stewards and a medic to ensure passenger comfort and
wellbeing. 22 dTons of cargo space is provided for the carriage of small
cargos. The cargo bay is well isolated from the passenger area to provide
security and safety.

The annual operating costs of the P-200AL are Cr 2,019,600 (assuming
the purchase of unrefined fuel and full lifesupport costs)
    [DESIGN NOTE: I\'ve assumed a monthly salary of Cr3,000 for the
                  sensor operator and Cr3,300 for the Steward/Gunner]
Standard annual finance costs are Cr 2,292,000
Giving an annual running cost of Cr 4,311,600

Assuming a full load of high passengers and cargo the P-200AL can generate
Cr 4,550,000 income per year (assuming 25 jumps per annum). This results in
the P-200AL giving a 94.7% Required Breakeven Occupancy (RBO). If a mail
contract can be secured the maximum income increases to Cr 5,050,000,
reducing the RBO to 85.4%. If wilderness refueling is used, the operating
costs fall to Cr 3,811,600 enabling a RBO of 83.8% without a mail contract
or 75.5% with a mail contract. The P-200AL is ideal for engaging in
speculative trade which can greatly increase the ships profitablity.

[[I did make one change wrt the SSDS.  It has always seemed quite silly
that the fuel purification plants listed in T4 are designed to process
huge amount so fuel rapidly, with little regard for their size.  CT, MT, &
TNE all listed much lower size limit on fuel purification plants, with a
correspondingly lower capacity.  I\'ve followed those guidelines for the
fuel purification plant on this ship, which has a fuel purifier with a
volume of 86 m3.]]

     The Tauri Lines Far Trader is a ship designed for exploratory trading
on the rim of the Imperium.  This ship is designed for speculative trade
with newly contacted areas.  It comes equipped with the latest safety
features, including a 3 ton, 10 passenger, turret- socket lifeboat, a
light laser turret for protection, and to allow the ship to carry Imperial
mail.  Also standard is a 23 m^3 , 6 seat, air raft for venturing down to
unknown or possibly worlds.  While somewhat more expensive than standard
ships, this vessel\'s ability to make 3 parsec jumps as well as its
numerous safety features should make it the ship of choice for adventurous
merchants.

     The turret socket lifeboat is the smallest lifeboat commonly made.
It is designed to fit exactly into a standard turret socket and can carry
up to10 passengers.  The lifeboat is designed to be used for up to 16
days.  While its accommodations are far from comfortable, they are
adequate to maintain the occupants in good health.

     The lifeboat is equipped with a normal set of controls and can be
operated by a single trained pilot.  If no one on board is able to pilot
the lifeboat it\'s autopilot is programmed to remove it from the vicinity
of the damaged ship, broadcast an emergency signal and head for the
nearest habitable planet.  The lifeboat\'s sensors are equivalent to
minimal civilian starship sensors and avionics, with the addition of much
more powerful communication gear.  The lifeboat and it is fully capable of
making a safe landing on almost any planet, without the aid of external
traffic control..

     If there is no habitable planet nearby the lifeboat will head for the
nearest planet which it can safely land on, or failing that, it will take
up orbit around a nearby gas giant.  The lifeboat has a locker containing
10 individual survival kits, 10 simple vac suits, 3 survival stills, 3
full medical kits, 2 survival tents, and 2 emergency beacons.

8) Break-even point:

Clearly this ship must engage in trading and speculation.  However, given
that this ship can get goods from point to point 50% faster than
conventional traders, in an era when no ships can possibly get there
faster this is not an unwarranted assumption.

Notes: How many times have you wondered why you paid for all those weapons
(and gunner\'s salaries) only to find they\'re never used for trip after
trip?

The Brave Heart could be your answer.

Not a ship to take into battle, the 200 ton Brave Heart Class Far Trader
(sometimes called the \'Brave Trader\') is primarily for use on secure trade
routes.

This ship emphasises trading capability and income generation with 134 tons
of cargo capacity and ten mid passage staterooms.  There\'s plenty of room
on the cargo deck for a 4 ton Air/Raft (not included).

This ship can even make a profit just carrying cargo and middle passengers
- - with speculation, the universe is your oyster.

After the recent buyout of Apogee Aerospace by the custom ship design
house Excession Shipyards, the future looked uncertain for Apogee.
However it seems Excession has relaunched Apogee as a mass-production
line, with the first model off the drawing boards and into production
being the Marco-Polo class Frontier trader.

Apparently named for a legendary Solomani trader, this ship is aimed
at the small trader market, with a special niche in mobility.
According to a press release from Apogee the ship is designed for
"exploring and breaking new markets off the beaten track."

Apogee claims that although the ship will only show marginal profit in
the Imperial core (and according to our research only with a full
hold), its real market is going to be speculative traders travelling
to the edges of the Imperium and even beyond.  To this end the ship
has been equiped with a fuel purifier, and allowances have been made
for two standard 97Mj small laser turrets.  Although fully crewing the
ship under these circumstances would reduce the number of cabins
available to mid level passengers to six, increased charges, and the
availability of speculative trade in such areas should more than make
up the difference.  (We think due to the low ammount of armour on this
model perhaps a sand-caster would be a better idea than a second laser
turret?)

The exterior of the ship shows Excession\'s trade mark lack of exterior
windows.  Instead the panoramic views available in the staterooms and
bridge are really external camera shots displayed on ultra-high
resolution screens, whilst this doesn\'t actually give the feeling of
actually "being" there, the designers point out the obvious weakpoints
in the hull of a ship caused by large windows, and claim that many of
their passengers actually prefered the feeling of security this
arrangement generates.

This allows the internal arrangement of the ship to be somewhat
unusual.  The cargo hold is actually at the front of the ship with the
ship\'s single large cargo hatch prominent at the nose of the craft.
Next back from that are the passenger and crew cabins, and behind
those the crew only flight deck and engineering areas.  The proximity
of these last two areas apparently makes it much easier for a small
crew to effectively manage a ship of this size.

The overall feeling here is the Marco-Polo is a well balanced ship
with good prospects in the Far Trader market.  It appears to be
slightly expensive as compared to other ships in this market, but
whether this is big enough to make much of an impact has yet to be
seen.

Description:

The Deneb Corporation Model 3-b Far Trader is the latest in a line of
popular civilian variants of the Model-47 military transport.  Improvements
over the base Model 3-a Free Trader include replacement of the standard J-1
jump drive with a larger J-2 drive, and the addition of auxilliary fuel
tanks in the ship\'s cargo bay.  The extra tanks may be disassembled and
stored to increase cargo capacity when long range jumps are not required.

Although the "DC-3" Series has generally been hailed throughout known space
as being an affordable, reliable and rugged general purpose cargo vessel,
the extremely spartan accomodations, and lack of defensive armaments have
made them unpopular with some crews.  (The stock version of the Far Trader
provides only a single small cabin for the vessel\'s captain, and three small
bunks for the remainder of the crew!)  As such, cargo space is often
converted to ad-hoc living quarters by many crews, and upgunned versions are
quite common, particularly along backwater routes within civilized space and
on the frontier.

- ----

    The SAMARKAND class is LTD\'s first commercial entry using the new
"Quartermaster Standard Design" -rated components: sufficient stability
and availability of these specifications, along with the substantial
discount they provide, should at last allow for more accessible and
economical blueprints.  LTD must note up front that the design does not
"break even" with Imperial-mandated freight charges (in any case, the
bulk freight market is largely sewn up by the megacorporations).  The
SAMARKAND is, instead, intended for the many small groups of speculative
traders that ply the trade-routes of the Imperium: its reliability,
customizability, and upgradeability should make it a tempting purchase
for such a small travelling group, and the breakeven point lies at just
15% of cargo devoted to reasonable speculative returns (10% if a single
high passenger is carried, even less if crew serve as working share-
holders).

    The ship is designed with an eye towards freight and speculative
cargo, pure and simple, though five small staterooms are available for
middle passages (in which case a medic must be carried) in case of
contractors wishing to accompany their cargo.  The lavish accomodations
required for High Passage licensure are not provided, though a retrofit
(and the addition of a steward to the crew) could allow two or three.  A
single high passenger could conceivably be carried in the single large
stateroom, originally intended for the captain or owner aboard, but
shipboard security could be compromised as those quarters are in the crew
section.  Still, the possibility exists.

    Indeed, flexibility is the hallmark of the SAMARKAND design.  To hold
costs down and allow ultimate end-user flexibility, the design includes
two empty turret sockets and 24MW excess power to allow any number of
weapon combinations.  The SAMARKAND\'s minimal sensor suite can easily be
upgraded after purchase with the Improved model, which at TL12 has an
identical displacement.  The hull (built with reliable TL10 crystaliron to
allow repairs at the widest variety of ports) is braced to withstand 3G
accelerations: though the installed thrusterplates cannot provide such
power (1G is possible, more with an empty hold), the additional internal
bracing helps withstand any rough treatment by freight dockworkers or in
crowded zero-g highports.  Onboard fuel scoops and purification facilities
have been designed to take as little space as possible from valuable cargo
holds, while allowing the ability to refuel at gas giants and thus bypass
unprofitable mainworlds sunk deep in a star\'s gravitational well.

    Moreover, LTD understands that the traditional Far Trader, while
enjoying great mobility, can suffer in competition with shorter-legged
Free Traders on Known Space\'s many 1-jump Mains.  Accordingly, our new
SAMARKAND is designed with dual jump-fuel tanks.  Permanent tankage
holds fuel for the power plant and a single jump-1.  But the fuel for
the additional parsec range is stored immediately aft of the cargo bay,
and contains a high-quality hatch to allow use of its 20-displacement-ton
space on jump-1 routes!  (Engineers *must* take care to ensure that all
hydrogen vapors are removed before freight loading, but the Imperial Bureau
of Safety ensures us that the design is technically sound.  LTD disclaims
all responsibility for accident in cases of improper sealing of the tank
entrance or of improper venting of liquid hydrogen fuel or vapors).

MEMORANDUM FOR:  IMMEDIATE NEWS RELEASE

SUBJECT:  CBW-A-0001-1 "Roland" Project Completion

  Custom Built Wreckage, Inc is proud to announce the completion of
the design phase of its first civilian production starship, the
CBW-A-0001-1 "Roland" class Far Trader.
  The Roland is an inexpensive starship designed for the private
entrepeneur or small trading company.  It is capable of carrying
twenty passengers and 66 Standard tons of cargo over short jump
distances both on and off normal trade routes.  Assuming a maximum
cargo and passenger manifest, the ship will be capable of operating at
a consistent profit without the need for speculation.
  Actual construction of the first Roland will begin within the month,
beginning with the construction and environmental stress-testing of
the hull and interior structure.

Blueprint Tour:
  The Roland class Far Trader is built on a 200 Standard ton,
streamlined disk hull.  There are two decks.  The lower deck is used
for cargo and quarters, and the upper deck is reserved for fuel
tankage.
  The forward section of the ship is dominated by the 66 ton cargo
bay, which opens to the front and is flanked on either side by the two
main airlocks.  The cargo bay ceiling is 5 meters in height, tall
enough to stack two standard cargo modules (2x2x3.5 meters) on top of
each other.
  On the port side of the ship is the command center and the crew
quarters.  A narrow corridor runs around the cargo bay, connecting all
sections of the ship.  The aft quarter of the ship is occupied by the
engineering and drive section, the low berths, the ship\'s locker,
and the small vehicle hangar.  Finally, the passenger staterooms are
located in the entire starboard side.  They are each 2 meters wide, 3
meters deep and 2.5 meters tall, stacked in columns of two to make
room for a modest common area (which includes sanfac units and ration
dispensers).  The upper row of staterooms is accessed by ladders on
each end of the corridor and has a 1 meter wide walkway.  The ship is
somewhat cramped, but the conditions are adequate for economy travel.
  The new Roland Far Trader will be built using high-quality, reliable
SSDS parts.

Breakeven:  Chances are good this will always have a full load of cargo,
  looking at the commercial rules.  So if passenger revenue drops to
  kCr 3133, then we\'re at breakeven.  This would be a full load of cargo,
  all middle passengers, and only six high passengers.  Crew with good
  skills in administration and carousing are indicated.  The margins are
  better if the ship is in "economy mode" and only doing jump-1.  Also
  it appears with well chosen routes, this ship will almost always
  operate at a high enough capacity to make money.  Number of staterooms
  were selected with an eye to the average number of passengers available
  at a system.


THE STAR-CLASS FAR LINER: A Starliner For A Fledgling Line

Ketaru Aerospace is proud to unveil their newest concept design for the
THUDDD-1 competition, the STAR-class far liner.  The STAR-class starliner
is an ideal small vessel for a fledgling line on a tight budget that
doesn\'t want to sacrifice their return on investment for price savings.
With jump drives rated for operation at two parsecs, you are no longer
tied to the mains, but can "get the jump" on your competition.

For a mere sixteen million credits down payment, the STAR can earn over
six and a half percent return on your initial investment in the first
year, after all operating costs have been covered!  But, well operated,
a STAR can bring in even greater returns for you and your company.

ECONOMY MODE: Your Unique Advantage!

The STAR-class ships have been equipped with collapsible dismountable
fuel tankage that allows you to increase your cargo space when operating
at jump-1.  Half of the jump fuel tankage can be collapsed to fill but
a quarter of the space when not in use, adding to your cargo payload
over twenty standard displacement tons of volume!  This can increase
your profitability on these runs by over 50 percent.  In economy mode,
this ship can operate near the ten percent or more return on initial
investment expected of a large Tukera bulk freighter operating in
standard jump-2 mode, excellent profitability for a ship in this size
class.

CARGO AND FREIGHT: Ample Space For Shipping

Plenty of room has been provided for your cargo and freight shipping
needs.  Whether hauling other people\'s goods or operating your own
trading business, over eleven hundred cubic meters are available for
shipping in addition to space set aside for the luggage of your high
passengers, even when the ship is not operating in "economy mode".
The STAR-class far liner can carry twenty IMoT-standardized six-meter
containers, or sixteen IMoT-standardized "seven seventy-seven" five
displacement-ton containers in standard mode.

SATISFIED MIDDLE PASSENGERS: No More "Bumping"

The key to profitability is a full load of passengers.  To make sure
that you can attract middle passage tickets, half of the twenty-four
passenger staterooms on the STAR-class far liner are designed
especially for middle passengers only.  This relieves your passengers
of the worry that they\'ll be bumped from their flight at the last
minute by some procrastinating high passenger.  But we have also
provided twelve special suites for the high passengers, furnished and
designed to satisfy the most discerning traveler.

Our financial analysts have determined the ideal number of staterooms
of each type to carry in order to allow the ship to carry a complete
complement of passengers on most flights.  However, there is always a
requirement for a friendly face and good skills in marketing to keep
your staterooms fully occupied, especially in recently settled areas
with sparse populations and traffic.

FUEL PURIFICATION: A Necessity To Control Costs

The STAR-class far liner is equipped with a seventy kiloliter per
hour fuel purification system, enabling you to operate on unrefined
fuel safely.  While most civilized planets won\'t just let you land
in the ocean for refueling, you can still purchase unrefined fuel
at a reduced rate and cut your hydrogen bill by eighty percent.

Usually, you will refuel immediately after unloading at the starport,
which gives you plenty of time to complete the refining process prior
to departure.  But if you don\'t have twelve hours to refine your fuel
on the ground, we have a solution.  We have subcontracted with Cleon
Industries to acquire a state-of-the-art two megawatt "Fusion+" cold
fusion generator to operate as an ancillary plant for all STAR-class
far liners, to power the fuel refinery when the maneuvering thrusters
are in operation.  Enough fuel is provided for three hundred hours of
operation a year.  We recommend performing a full maintenance and
replacement of the solid-state core of the "Fusion+" unit every six
years to insure reliable operation.

A FULL CREW COMPLEMENT: Safety and Security For Your Customers

Some small commercial vessels have been known to operate with reduced
crews.  As part of the Tukera philosophy, Ketaru Aerospace feels that
you only are putting your ship and customers in danger when operating
below crew levels recommended by the Ministry of Transportation.  The
STAR-class liner maintains full crewing levels to make sure that your
crew is always there for the customer.

In addition, all STAR-class starliners are equipped with vac suits,
emergency survival bubbles, and all other safety equipment in accord
with Imperial safety regulations.

CUSTOMIZATION: Making The STARs Right For You

Often, it becomes necessary to tailor your ship to your market and your
needs.  The STAR-class liner as provided may not fulfill the special
requirements of your route.  While we intend to mass-produce the basic
model, after-market additions such as advanced sensor arrays are most
certainly available.  If you are trying to operate in an unsecured area
(such as the run to the LSP industrial facility at Deneb), a ten ton
section of the cargo area is specially equipped as an "option area";
this area is ideally placed for hull access.  Some configurations that
have been suggested so far have included a six ton "weapons option"
which includes a three-ton civilian laser, 20 MW power system, and
gunner\'s station and stateroom, for MCr 3.44 (just kCr 14.3 a month!).
Ketaru has also been considering suggestions for a three-ton hangar
for a grav flyer such as the Rolen "Politesse".  Due to the fact that
no such hangar is currently available as an IDP design, this is still
being studied as an after-market add-on by Ketaru.  If you just can\'t
decide, you can install both, or two turrets, or whatever you fancy!

None of these options are included with the basic model.

MARKETING FOR THE STARS: Your Profitable Future

Ketaru envisions the STAR-class liners to be named after distant ports
visited by Imperial vessels: "Star of Terra", or "Denebian Star", for
example.  This will encourage your customers to think of the uncharted
possibilities of the new galactic marketplace, and the exotic places
to which they and their product may travel on your vessels.

The time to return to the stars is today!  Contact Ketaru Aerospace in
Mifa Lanco, or our orbital facility at Ton Vorn, Capital/Core, for more
information on our product line.

Ketaru Aerospace is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tukera Lines, LIC,

Crew Detail (standard): 1 Pilot/Engineer, 1 Astrogator/Sensors, 1 Medic, 1
Steward

Notes:

Crew assumes a standard work force, it may vary from 2 to 11 depending on
circumstances; 4 crew gives a middle passenger load of 10. The ship has a
total of 14 small staterooms.

The ship uses a Dismountable, collapsing fuel tank which accounts for the
varying
cargo and fuel amounts. Assembled, the PICH-1/2 is capable of Jump 2 with 40
tons of fuel and 93 tons cargo; when it is stored, the ship will do Jump 1
with 20
tons fuel and 108 tons cargo. The scoop can refuel the ship in 30 minutes for a
Jump 2 (15 min for a Jump 1), and the refinery can process it in 13h 20m (6h
40m).
The tank takes 5 tons of space when unassembled. I included 1 ton of fuel for
the power plant which will run it for around 1/2 a year.

The ship has 5 workstations of TL9 included in case it must run with a full
crew.

The J-Drive is TL11, the controls are TL 12 civ, sensors TL 12 basic, and comms
are TL 12 basic.

Pricing and costs:

TOTAL COST 84.60 MCr, 63.45 MCr with the QSDS discount. This gives a DOWN-
PAYMENT of 12.69 MCr and MONTHLY PAYMENTS of 264,391 Cr. MAINTENANCE
costs 5288 Cr a month Fuel costs 8200 Cr a month for 40 tons, 4200 Cr a month
for 20 tons (both unrefined, if scooping it\'s free, of course). The cost of
SALARIES
breaks down via crewing: 11 crew= 67,000 Cr, 4 crew= 33,000 Cr, and 2 crew =
11,000 Cr, all per month. If the crew are PCs/owner-operators, the salaries
are 0.
LIFE SUPPORT runs 56,000 Cr per month.

Obviously, this ship is designed with a crew of 4 owner operators or PCs in mind in
order to be profitable. With the tank disassembled and full loads, a group of 4
could bring in a moderate amount of profit on the Jump 1 route, and would break
a little more than even with Jump 2 capability.

The Burov class free trader is the oldest and one of the most successful
designs to come out of the KenFee Interstellar shipyards on Yanbeck.  The
Burov was designed to be an inexpensive no-frills way to transport beings and
goods between star systems.  The Burov\'s jump drive gives it a range of 2
parsecs and its thrusters are cable of accelerating 2,000 tons at 1G.  The
greatest strength of the Burov is the ease in which KenFee is able to produce
ships of different passenger and cargo capacities to meet customers
requirements.  One of the more well know, if not infamous, variations is the
40 passenger type used by the DC Discount Starline (Detailed above).  The
Brightly colored ships of DC Discount are a common sight thought out the
central Draconis Cluster.  The cramp and sparten conditions are quite often
made worst by DC allowing multiple beings to occupy rooms clearly designed
for only one.  Despite these conditions, DC Discount\'s prices ensure that
staterooms are rarely unoccupied.  On the other end of the scale, KenFee has
produce many Burovs designed primarily a cargo haulers.  The most common
cargo hauler variant has 112dtons of cargo and 6 small staterooms.  Recently
orders for Burovs have fallen dramatically in part due to the design\'s age
but mostly due to many recent and well publicized disasters involving Burovs.
 KenFee contends that several of the disasters involving older ships were the
result of improper maintenance.  The two most recent disasters both involved
DC Discount ships, with DC Discount claiming sabotage in both cases.

Here are the stats for the couple of Burov class variants.  The first is the
cargo hauler and the secend is a typically example of

Allen Shock wanted some suggestions about how to explain
why the stars changed between T4 and First Survey.

Here\'s a few.

1)The players ship misjumps, but instead of a misjump in
space, they misjump to a new dimension.  The new dimension being
the new map.  Everything would be the same in this new dimension
except for some planets being in different spots.  Maybe the 
occasional weird event happens just to remind the players something
weird happened. One problem is that the players will spend alot
of time trying to get back to their old dimension.  That is unless
you tell them the real reason, and that defeats the purpose.

2)You could bring in the Ancients.  If you have another pocket empire
in the area. You could have them somehow find an Ancient device that
is capable of altering space-time.  Their scientists try to use the 
device to wipe out the new found Imperium.  But due to their lack of a
full understanding of the device, they totaly mutate everything.
Destroying several planets and moving others around.  It would
be really neat if they managed to wipe out their own worlds.  
You\'d get to bring in the old theme of scientists playing with forces
that they don\'t understand.  see countless bad sci-fi movies.
It would be interesting if the players knew people ont he planets
that disappered.

You could also try to have the players find those responsable,
but I think it would be safer if the and their machine disapperd
along with the missing planets.  This way it would eliminate
the possiblity of someone playing with the device again.

3)Your players were given a REALLY bad map.    

Well that\'s all I could come up with on the spur of the moment.

You keep the vector you jumped in with but with a "typical" planetary orbit

Yes, I did know that.  The extras on the bridge were actually playing

As you already know, William, my system combines these two ideas.  I 
don\'t consider them two seperate methods.

And, just FYI, here\'s a table detailing the chance of success using 
the difficulty fix that you labled Method 2 above.  Whether you use 
the double skill-half attribute system to generate your target 
number, I think that you might agree that these percentages for 
success are quite agreeable.

FOR 1.5 DICE TASK THROWS (Easy Tasks):

7				58.33
8				72.22
9				83.33
10				91.67
11+				97.22



FOR 2.5 DICE TASK THROWS (Difficult Tasks):

Chance of SS = 0.93
Chance of SF = 2.78

24				80.04
25				80.31
26+				80.38


Take a look at the numbers.  You might agree that they look pretty 
good.  

One of the neat things about the T4 system is the SS and SF 
percentages.  As a task gets harder, the chance of doing really well 
at it goes down drastically whereas the chance of screwing up big 
time goes up drastically.  The harder a task is, the harder it will 
be to do an exceptional job at it and the much more likely that the 
character attempting the task will screw up in a big way.

You\'ve got to admit, there\'s something clean and smooth about a 
system that offers that without a complex system.

First off, a level 6 in any skill is REALLY high in my book.  I\'ve 
seen a level 7 on a character before, but I\'ve never seen a level 8.  
Level 6, in my game and in most other\'s, would put your character at 
the epitome of his skill.  He as raised the skill in question to an 
art form, and there aren\'t that many others who have the same 
profeciency in the skill as he does.

Given this, I expect him to do well at Impossible tasks.  Your 
character has two level 4 skills, a 5, and a 6 with a couple of 3\'s 
thrown in.  This character would be a god in my campaign.  Since 
you\'ve played him for a long time (intense adventuring, of course), I 
can accept his level of skill.

On top of his incredible skill in Fast Talk, the character also has 
an incredible Edu and Int score.

So let\'s see.  The character is incredibly skilled (level 6), highly 
educated (EDU 13), and very intelligent (INT 14).

This guy is definitely not an average joe when it comes to Fast 
talking, and he\'d better kick ass at this because it doesn\'t get any 
better than this.

Looking  at how he would do with my system...

You said it was an Impossible task at Fast Talk.  

His target number would be 19 using either his EDU or INT--pretty 
good.

Referring to the chance success charts I put on my reply to William\'s 
message...

Fred has a 64.98% chance of success.

Hey, I can see that with this character, and there is still room for 
failure (a 19.62% chance of SF) at this Impossible task.

I guess I don\'t see the problem you are having with the system.

dimension/universe.  You could make one of the T4 rulebook systems a
"Bermuda Triangle" of sorts.  The gravity or other astronomical forces
within the system upset the jump drive balance in such a way that an
extraordinary misjump occurs, and the ship finds itself in the same
system in the new First Survey dimension/universe.  Only this system
won\'t have the same weird astronomical goings-on that caused the original
misjump, thus they are stuck there until they find another way home.

As for ongoing "weirdness", you could always make just very slight
differences.  You know, the PCs\' j-drive orientation is one way for the
original universe, but is another in the First Survey universe.  Cleon\'s
hair is raven black in the original, but is platinum blond in the new,
other things.  Maybe the original universe knew where Terra was and Vland
was a legend, and it\'s vice versa in the First Survey universe.

is treated as waste space, and is unavailable for use.
The ship has an empty 3ton turret that may mount any standard weapon. While
there is no surplus power available, it is assumed that any weaponry
mounted could draw from the fuel processing plant allocated power.

Mekhuriim Announces New Trader

With a minimum of fanfare, Mekhuriim placed on the market today their new
Khushdakaa class trader. The Khushdakaa (which is Vilani for Opportunity)
is "a perfect ship for the independent entrepreneur to venture into the
great realm of interstellar commerce" a company spokesman stated.
At first glance, the Khushdakaa is unimpressive. Displacing only 100 tons,
it is one of the smallest starships available. It is capable of a modest
2-parsec jump and 1-G sustained acceleration. The small size of the craft
means that the ship has a rather small cargo capacity, 35 to 42 tons,
depending on the mission profile. If the ship is operated at the full
recommended crew levels, there is no room for passengers. Thus one might
question the validity of Mekhuriim\'s design.
However, upon second glance, the Khushdakaa class has several unique
features that may attract certain buyers. For instance, the size of the
ship, along with a high degree of computer automation, allows for a crew of
only one - perfect for the individual trader. When the ship\'s owner
operates the ship by himself he does not have to worry about paying
salaries. Since the Khushdakaa possesses fuel scoops and a refining plant
(a rarity for a ship this small), an enterprising captain can reduce fuel
costs to a minimum. By dispensing with the standard crew, an independent
trader can take on three passengers at "middle-class" level of comfort.
Perhaps the most innovative aspect of the Khushdakaa is it\'s fuel/cargo
system. The ship, as designed, has fuel for a year\'s operation of of the
power plant and a single jump-1. However, the drive is capable of jump-2.
This disparity is addressed with the mounting of a permanent collapsible
fuel tank mounted on the cargo deck. This tank, when filled, brings the
ship\'s fuel levels to the point where Jump-2 is possible. If the ship needs
to make only a jump-1, however, the captain can collapse the auxiliary tank
to a smaller package - giving the captain an extra 7.5 tons of cargo space.
This can be quite useful on jump-1 mains, where the extra tonnage means
extra profit potential.
A detailed financial analysis of the Khushdakaa\'s performance seems to show
that the ship has no potential for profit. This is most certainly true if
the ship\'s captain limits himself to hauling normal freight. However, this
vessel can prove to be an excellent starship to engage in speculative
trading. The vessel can also command higher rates by operating in frontier
situations - the ship\'s hull is armored, and the structure of the craft has
been reinforced to the equivalent of a ship capable of pulling 6-Gs. And
even though the craft is equipped with gravtic compensators, the vessel
also has four g-tanks for high-acceleration periods (such as taking off and
landing). With a weapon mounted on the ship, the Khushdakaa\'s survivability
factor exceeds that of a standard free or far trader - just what an
enterprising captain needs.
The Khushdakaa is designed as a streamlined teardrop, with drives mounted
on the rounder end, and crew decks up above near the narrow end. The ship
has no contra-grav systems (to save cost), and so it must land in a
vertical orientation. The decks are mounted perpendicular to the ship\'s
motion, to relieve stress on the grav plates.
Mekhuriim has announced immediate availability for the Khushdakaa class, as
well as a cheaper class known as the Darlegii class (identical class except
drives are rated at only jump-1?the only difference being the purchase
price, 35.5MCr).

1xHanger Air Raft      Armor:0 Structure:6

Crew Data: 1 Pilot/Astrogator/Electronics and 1 Engineer.


 The Goshawk Far Trader is the successor to the Sidhe TL-11 Far Trader,
 it uses the miniaturization of fusion plants to great advantage.  It
 has been designed to haul a fair bit of cargo, and several passengers.
 It is definetly not a warship, it has very thin  armor.  The armor is
 proof against small arms fire, but not much else.  A sandcaster is
 factory standard, but other weaponry is available upon request.  The
 ship also has an extremely poor sensor suite, but for normal navigation
 it works fine.  It does have an air raft in an 8 ton vehicle bay,
 located in the front of the ship.  The vehicle bay has its own
 cargo bay door to facilitate unloading.

 The ship is configured to carry passengers, but it isn\'t intended to
 carry High passengers. These passengers require more room, and
 This is the ship which will eventually evolve into the sleek looking
 Jayhawk Far Trader.  In the early years of the Imperium the ship has
 some of the retro look that is so trendy.  Instead of Jayhawk\'s rear
 airfoil, the Goshawk has twin tailfins.  These help the ship in atmospheric
 maneuvering.  In general it is just slightly boxier looking than a Jayhawk.

 I tried to follow the designs of previous Far Traders, including the
 TL-12 Jayhawk, and the TL-15 Empress Marva. I also designed a Tl-11
 version, a TL-15 version, and a variant of the Empress Marva. I\'ll
 post these in the next few days.

 Costs
 I assume the standard 25 trips a year with full occupancy.

 Down Payment:  11.586MCr

 Yearly Expenses
 Bank Payment: 2.574 MCr
 Annual Maintenance Fee: 0.05793 MCr
 Salaries: 0.12 MCr      (6000cr for Pilot + 4000Cr for Engineer x12 months)
 Life Support: 0.75 MCr (2000Cr x 15 staterooms x 25 trips)
 Monthly Fuel: 0.1001 MCr (40 tons jump fuel x 25 trips + 1 PP ton *100cr/ton)
Total: 3.602MCr

 Yearly Income
 Middle Passages: 2.6 MCr
 Cargo: 1.85 MCr  (74 tons * 25 trips * 1000Cr) (3 tons is set aside for
baggage)
Total: 4.45

 Net Income=0.848 MCr

 At 80% occupancy of both cargo and passengers, it brings in 3.56MCr
 causing it to lose a small amount of money.  If the ship is able to make more
 than 25 trips, with quick turn around times, it will make more money.
 The passengers allow the ship to break even, with pure cargo the ship
 will lose money.

I suggest that this rule should be interpreted as 1/8th of a steward per
command crew and high passenger and 1/50th of a steward per crew and mid
passenger (With a minimum of one).

1) It was an Old Sylean Map, the IISS changed it on year 0 to match new 
data.

2)It was an old Solomani(Rule of Man) map.  The new map accounts for 2000 
years of stellar drift(REEEEACHING!).

3)It was an old Vilani (1st Imperium) map  New map accounts for 6000 yrs of

This is what I would do.  The idea works best if the players have not been
told that the Core layout has changed...

        When the players return to Core, don\'t tell them right off the bat
that anything is wrong.  Let them begin to stumble on the discrepancies
themselves.  Confused, they go back and check the nav computer...then the
library data...and everything checks out.  But this is not the way they
remember the Core subsector...
        Someone has altered their memories.  Some crucial event, or series
of events, has been edited out of their minds.  During the reprogramming,
certain extraneous details (like their remembrances of stellar positions and
planetary data) got skewed.  Now the players have to retrace their steps to
learn who has tampered with their minds, and why.  Could be a megacorp,
could be the Zhodani.  Hell, it could be the Ancients.  A crafty GM could
have a lot of fun making the players wonder just how much of their
background is real, or invented by someone else?  You could run a whole
campaign based on this premise.

Although you have no interest in it, several others do. And although I
have no interest in several other topics that goes on in this list
I don\'t want them moved of the list. Although you use to much of your
time reading the ISBA posts, it seems to me that there should be no
problem jumping over the posts as most of them have clear
roleplaying given subjects.  "******* wuth new press release." and

(ie. these are \'break-even- figures)

NOTE: The line "Cargo Profit (per Std)" refers to the
average profit per Std. of cargo that the ship must
earn to break even. None of these ships can break even 
by hauling cargo at 1,000 Cr/Std. It is not unreasonable,
however, to assume that a competent merchantman can 
earn more than this by speculating.

Furthermore, note that from TL11 to TL12, the amount of 
profit needed per Std of cargo goes from 2,715 to 1,506, a drop 
of 44%! The Far Trader becomes _much_ more profitable
with the introduction of Fusion+ at TL12. Although the TL10
version is is slightly cheaper than the TL11 version, it
is less desirable in that it uses HEPlaR drives instead of 
thrusters and it uses a fission pile instead of a fusion
reactor, both of which are difficult for typical merchant
crews to maintain in the field.

Also, the ship has no skimming or refining capabilities and
all costs are calculated assuming that refined fuel is 
available and purchased.

None of these are passenger ships - all crew and the 2 
middle class passengers (if any) have small staterooms.
If there are no low passengers, the medic can be omitted
from the crew roster. If the middle passage cabins are
empty and the captain and/or pilot is competent to make
cargo arrangements at port, then the steward can be omitted 
as well, saving crew and life support costs. The sickbay
and the medic are necessities, however, if any low passangers
are being carried.

Finally, as you probably noticed, it\'s unarmed. Stay out of
trouble. (Any ships that expects to buy refined fuel at every
port of call can also assume that it\'s not likely to get into
any firefights.)

PRESS RELEASE

Sylea - GSbAG released the plans today for the newest in its
line of \'Marco Polo\' class Far Traders. This newest model in 
a distinguished line of ships mounts the same basic drive
components as its predecessor, but incorporates a new Zunhastu
Lab Fusion+ unit, thus greatly increasing the amount of space
available for cargo. At the press conference, Rishii Smith of 
\'Road, Track & SubOrbital\' said,

 "It\'s a great ship! Neat, compact and over 50 percent of it is
 devoted to cargo! Amazing! It\'s almost rude of GSbAG to release
 such a ship - it\'s going to put all the owners of the old
 \'Marco Polo\' class ships out of business!"

When asked about this at the press announcement, the GSbAG
representative replied that "... we\'ve had the previous version
of the \'Marco Polo\' on the market for three hundred and fifty-
four years, did you think we were going to rest on our laurels?"

The new \'Marco Polo\' mounts a jump-2 drive and thrusters capable
of one standard gee, similar to the previous version. Upgraded
components include an improved sensor and communication suite,
increased computer capacity, but most importantly, the new Fusion+
plant and increased cargo space. There is an extra 16 standard
displacement tons of cargo space in the new model, which means
extra profits for any free merchant. GSbAG continues in its 
tradition of looking after ship crews, even in jump space, by
providing its standard 2-person sickbay and GSbAG\'s well-known,
high quality system recyclers and food processors.

Finally, the new \'Marco Polo\' is also a breakthrough in terms 
of price - for just 14.5 MCr you can put down an initial 
payment on one of these ships and be moving you crew and cargo 
in upgraded, modern style.

From memory, they are taller than average (Zhodane/Zhdant is about .9g),
and vaguely middle-eastern looking - they lean more towards olive/tan colour
skin and were always portrayed wearing turbans for some inexplicable reason...
when I say middle-eastern, think Turkey or Greece, although I realize that\'s
not Middle-eastern... Mediterriean! (sp) That\'s what I\'m looking for.
Think Mediterrean.

Whether you are missing something depends on your campaign. In my
campaign, the astrogator (more properly, the /navigator/) keeps
watch over the ship\'s progress through jumpspace and calculates
the jumpspace course corrections needed to offset small inaccuracies
in the initial jump solution. He\'s busy all week.

RE:   THUDDD-1 CONCEPT "C" PASSENGER COMPLEMENT

[deleted]

Here is the data you requested on our feeder line experiences with
interstellar passenger demand.  This information is sensitive, and
should not be disclosed to anyone not on the primary design team.

Our investigations indicate that fledgling lines and free traders
appear to observe demand based primarily on the population of the
worlds served.  In our initial compilation of several years worth
of data, we have arrived at the following average demand for low,
high, and middle passages, and freight shipments:

 Pop.    ---- Passengers ----    Freight 
(UWP)    High  Middle  Cold     (Std)
 ----
  0       --     --     --        --  
  1       --      1      1         0
  2        0      3      7        60       
  3        5      6      7       105
  4        6      6      9.5     150
  5        6      8.5    9.5     195
  6        8.5    8.5   10.5     240
  7        8.5    9.5   10.5     285
  8        9.5    9.5   14       333
  9        9.5   10.5   17.5     378
  A       10.5   14     21       429

However, we have abserved that ships which carry a purser even
moderately skilled in administration and the art of working
with people tend to increase their averages of high and middle
passengers by one or two tickets in each category.  This seems
to be due to better working relationships with the ticketing
agencies and better success in attracting the higher-classs
passenger.

Filling cargo holds is, of course, not a problem, especially
in the small size class of the THUDDD-1 starships.  We feel
that there should be enough freight in transit from most 
worlds to keep the holds full, and any shortfall can most
certainly be made up by speculative trade.  We will make no
assumptions of the ability of the average new line owner to
operate more profitably primarily in speculative trade, at
least without Tukera\'s long experience in this matter. 

We\'re still in the process of compiling this data and making
statistical studies of how they fluctuate, but at this time
we recommend no more than twelve staterooms in each ticketing
classification to maintain full passenger carriage rates, and
this is assuming that routes are chosen mainly to travel to
worlds with a population of one million or more.  Admittedly,
this is a conservative estimate, but we believe a safe one.
Clearly, transits directly between high population worlds can 
carry much more in the way of lucrative passenger traffic.

We hope this information is of assistance.

Cordially,

First of all its a really great book Dick, but you can\'t dance to it. 
I give it a 67, Dick.  Sorry, went into flashbacks of American 
Bandstand.  <G>

Anyways.  Here\'s your basic Milieu 0 Synopsis:  

Milieu 0 is 112 pages long, as many of the most recent T4 books have 
been.  There are 2 pages of ads, 1 for JTAS, 1 for First Survey.  The 
artwork is all Chris Foss.  All interior illustrations are black and 
white (no more color plates in the middle of the book.  It has the 
same rounded starship look that the other T4 books have, although a 
lot of the interior illos have lots of people <G>, and the  cover painting 
has a starship apparently lifting or moving giant busts the size of what 
you\'d find on Easter Island.  Probably the most intriguing T4 cover yet, IMO.  

Longtime subscribers of TML will remember Marc Miller\'s Outline for 
the book which was posted last fall, so most of what I write will not 
be a surprise to them.  CORE took the liberty of rearranging the work 
into what we felt to be a more consistent manner.  

The book is seperated into 8 chapters, which I will detail as I list 
them.

1 thing I like about it is the last paragraph which says the 
following:  "This is a meaty book.  There is a lot here to digest.  
But there is also incredible potential for adventure.  Enjoy."

As somebody who wrote part of the book, and saw the manuscript well 
before its publication, I can only agree.  Whether the meat in question 
is filet mignon, or round steak, I leave to you to decide.  :-)
 
Chapter 1:  Antecedents to the Imperium (pp. 5-12)

Basically a set of historical essays.  A very pro-Cleon history of 
the 1st and 2nd Imperiums, a bigger essay on the rise of the Sylean 
Federation and the rise of the Imperium out of it.  Writeups on 2 of 
Sylea\'s early neighbors/enemies, the Chanestin Kingdom and the 
Interstellar Confederacy.  A sidebar in the form of  a speech from an 
anti-Cleon member of the moot with an alternative view on just how 
"benevolent" the new Imperium is.  A lot of the stuff on the 1st and 
2nd Imperiums are restatements of what you\'ve seen before, from a 
slightly different point of view.  The rest of the stuff is all VERY 
new.

Chapter 2:  The Expansion Process  (pp. 13-25)

This chapter details the process of survey, exploration, 1st (and 
followup) Contacts, and basically the Scout method of adding worlds 
to the Imperium.  The chapter is loaded with adventure hooks, and gives 
some very definite adventure ideas.  Loaded with adventure hooks.

Chapter 3:  The First Wave  (pp. 26-41)

Lots of stuff.  This chapter talks about the first expansion of the 
3rd Imperium.  The Great Rift.  The Role of the Scouts, Army, & Navy 
in expansion.  Opportunities from Expansion (all kinds of roleplaying 
hints and adventure hooks).  Problems of the Expansion  (Internal 
Conflicts, Enemies, etc).  The chapter is basically 16 pages of 
adventure hooks.

Chapter 4:  Power Structures Circa Year 0  (pp. 42-63)  

Essays on the structure of the Sylean Federation.  A world writeup of 
Sylea itself.  Another essay on the governmental structure of the 
Third Imperium.  The Structure of the Vilani Confederation.  
Intelligence Agencies in Year 0.  Various essays on the Vilani as 
sidebars.  Adventure hooks aplenty for the Agent character class.  
The structure of a typical Year 0 megacorp (In this case, Zhunastu 
Industries).  Writeups on other megacorps of year 0, some familiar 
ones, and some unfamiliar ones.  Writeups on smaller corporations in 
Year 0, again, a few familiar ones, some unfamiliar.  An essay on the 
Imperial Moot.  An essay on something even Vilani & Vargr glossed 
over, the AAB.

Chapter 5:  Refereeing Milieu 0  (pp. 64-74)

A great essay on running political adventures in Traveller.  A brief 
writeup on the major races and the Imperium.  A writeup on the 
Jgd-Il-Jagd, a previously published Alien Minor race during the CT 
days that was not included in Aliens Archive.  Some Sample 
Encounters, Patrons, and Events.  An article on the Disciples of the 
Bright Way.  Archon Adventures  (Just what is the Archon, anyways?).

Chapter 6:  Library Data  (pp. 75-93)

Your basic library data section.  Writeups on the major personalities 
of the 3rd Imperium, the major places, organizations and things, such 
as Jeff Zeitlin\'s Warrant of Restoration (used with his permission, I might 
add, and nice work on his part).  Thanks, Jeff!  A History section with essays 
on history up to year 0.  

Unfortunately, 1 of the "things" was inadvertently omitted from 
pp. 86, the deckplan for the Scout Cruiser (since I designed the 
deckplan, I will be seeking IG\'s permission shortly to have it posted 
on IG\'s website, or rather, since I have the opportunity to dress it up 
and make it look even better, I\'ll do that, then seek permission to post).  

Chapter 7:  Core Sector, Referee Data (pp. 94-103)

Pretty self explanatory.  The data from First Survey\'s Core sector is 
included here, along with a map.

Chapter 8:  Rumors (pp. 104-110)

The TML submitted rumors are listed, with proper credit (AFAIK) for 
those who submitted rumors a couple of months ago in response to a 
request by Tony Lee.

Summary:  

I said I\'m not going to pretend to give you an objective review of a 
product that I wrote part of.  I won\'t.  I like this book.  It has a 
ton of adventure hooks, and all sorts of good stuff that is 
immediately useful to somebody looking to run a Milieu 0 campaign.  
I was very proud of the work that CORE submitted to IG back in 
November when it happened.  Looking at it now, I\'m just as proud.

Along these lines, you could send them on part of their current adventure
that takes them back in time, with the promise that they will come back to
the present... of course, it may not be the present that *they* remember...
who knows how things might change?  :)

Re: the Ancients:  how many of you have made use of Grandfather and/or the
Ancients in your campaigns?  I\'ve got a campaign idea that involves beings
that _may_ have been Ancients at one time, and could involve some Big
Changes to the system the players find themselves in (but not, I think,
with the risk of making the game unplayable later).  Hmmm.  I guess that
sounds pretty nebulous.  Anyway, I\'d be interested in how anyone else has
used the Ancients, if at all.

Thanks.

RE:   THUDDD-1 CONCEPT "C" PASSENGER COMPLEMENT

[deleted]

Here is the data you requested on our feeder line experiences with
interstellar passenger demand.  This information is sensitive, and
should not be disclosed to anyone not on the primary design team.

Our investigations indicate that fledgling lines and free traders
appear to observe demand based primarily on the population of the
worlds served.  In our initial compilation of several years worth
of data, we have arrived at the following average demand for low,
high, and middle passages, and freight shipments:

 Pop.    ---- Passengers ----    Freight 
(UWP)    High  Middle  Cold     (Std)
 ----
  0       --     --     --        --  
  1       --      1      1         0
  2        0      3      7        60       
  3        5      6      7       105
  4        6      6      9.5     150
  5        6      8.5    9.5     195
  6        8.5    8.5   10.5     240
  7        8.5    9.5   10.5     285
  8        9.5    9.5   14       333
  9        9.5   10.5   17.5     378
  A       10.5   14     21       429

However, we have abserved that ships which carry a purser even
moderately skilled in administration and the art of working
with people tend to increase their averages of high and middle
passengers by one or two tickets in each category.  This seems
to be due to better working relationships with the ticketing
agencies and better success in attracting the higher-classs
passenger.

Filling cargo holds is, of course, not a problem, especially
in the small size class of the THUDDD-1 starships.  We feel
that there should be enough freight in transit from most 
worlds to keep the holds full, and any shortfall can most
certainly be made up by speculative trade.  We will make no
assumptions of the ability of the average new line owner to
operate more profitably primarily in speculative trade, at
least without Tukera\'s long experience in this matter. 

We\'re still in the process of compiling this data and making
statistical studies of how they fluctuate, but at this time
we recommend no more than twelve staterooms in each ticketing
classification to maintain full passenger carriage rates, and
this is assuming that routes are chosen mainly to travel to
worlds with a population of one million or more.  Admittedly,
this is a conservative estimate, but we believe a safe one.
Clearly, transits directly between high population worlds can 
carry much more in the way of lucrative passenger traffic.

We hope this information is of assistance.

Cordially,

First of all its a really great book Dick, but you can\'t dance to it. 
I give it a 67, Dick.  Sorry, went into flashbacks of American 
Bandstand.  <G>

Anyways.  Here\'s your basic Milieu 0 Synopsis:  

Milieu 0 is 112 pages long, as many of the most recent T4 books have 
been.  There are 2 pages of ads, 1 for JTAS, 1 for First Survey.  The 
artwork is all Chris Foss.  All interior illustrations are black and 
white (no more color plates in the middle of the book.  It has the 
same rounded starship look that the other T4 books have, although a 
lot of the interior illos have lots of people <G>, and the  cover painting 
has a starship apparently lifting or moving giant busts the size of what 
you\'d find on Easter Island.  Probably the most intriguing T4 cover yet, IMO.  

Longtime subscribers of TML will remember Marc Miller\'s Outline for 
the book which was posted last fall, so most of what I write will not 
be a surprise to them.  CORE took the liberty of rearranging the work 
into what we felt to be a more consistent manner.  

The book is seperated into 8 chapters, which I will detail as I list 
them.

An external observer would detect a burst of energy (neutrinos, gravitational 
disturbance, plus radiation from visible light to infra-red); basically a bright 
flash lasting a fraction of a second. The energy released is proportional to the 
size of ship and distance jumped.

The effect on crew and passengers varies. Most report a moment of dizziness, 
and/or a falling sensation. Headaches or mild nausea are not uncommon. Misjumps 
generally feel worse.

> 3. Once in J-space, what, if anything, do crew looking out viewports see?

Viewing Jumpspace directly is extremely unpleasant, usually resulting in severe 
headaches and/or hallucinations.

> What sort of sensor readings does the ship get?

Heat: about 10K
Gravity: none
Visible: dull red
Radiation: variable, but generally low
Atmosphere: \'vacuum\' (slightly denser than N-space)

> 4. If energy or matter is introduced to the N-space-J-space boundary, what

Anything extending outside the (1m) bubble at the time of jump is cleanly cut 
off. Not usually dangerous unless a) it has a significant mass, or b) it blocks 
10% of the bubble.

Anything leaving the bubble during the jump misjumps catastrophically.

Similar energy pulse, but much smaller (1%). Sensation as per J-space entry.

Have them make a "misjump". The jump isn\'t "right" but at first they
can\'t find anything wrong...

I had sent word last week about spotting an article in Cinefantastique 
that mentioned Traveller, Sweetpea, etc. Here\'s an excerpt from that 
article that gives more details:

(BTW, all mistakes in names--"THE TRAVELLER", \'Mark\' Miller" in the 
article...)

The article is "Coming Attractions" by Dan Persons and is in the March 
1997 issue (Volume 28, Number 9). To quote:

"This time around, we\'ve got one guy whose production company has yet to 
produce a single frame of film, but whose snapping up of high-profile 
genre licenses seems to have caught the attention of one of Hollywood\'s 
major players..."

"Courtney Solomon seems to be auditioning for irrestible force. A while 
ago we told you how he (and a Canadian investor based in Hong Kong) 
picked up the feature rights to DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS for his newly formed 
Sweetpea ENtertainment production company. Now, he\'s not only grabbed all 
rights to another RPG classic, THE TRAVELLER, and is planning to launch 
what he terms a \'high-brow horror-thriller franchise\' with something 
called THE DESCENDANT, he\'s also swung an agreement with Disney to pick 
up the live-action rights to Image Comics\' hit title GEN 13. Objective: a 
full-length feature sometime in 1998."

(...material about D&D movie deleted...)

(...material about GEN 13 movie deleted...)

"Equally intriguing is Sweetpea\'s acquisition of THE TRAVELLER, the 
classic, science-fiction role-playing game which was recently re-released 
with new, and quite impressive, art by Chris Foss. Solomon has entered 
into an agreement with Rob Liefeld\'s Extreme Studios for a comic book to 
be released sometime in the next few months, with the ultimate goal a 
weekly TV series. \'It\'s a very different take,\' says Solomon, \'than, say 
STAR TREK or STAR WARS. The real, core science ficiton fans know it, and 
they really look at it up on that same level, because it\'s sophisticated 
and it\'s intelligent. There are no defined characters there, but there\'s 
a very defined universe; really what Mark Miller, the creator, has done 
is create a hundred thousand years of future history, and he\'s divided 
them into 16 different eras. That\'s kind of cool, because when I look at 
it, I think to myself, <<begin italics>> Well, if your TV series flies, 
then you\'ve got everything pre-done to go to a STAR TREK: THE NEXT 
GENERATION or DEEP SPACE NINE spin off... <<end italics>>...You\'re still 
keeping the main foundation, but you\'re moving into a different time 
period. It\'s very hard to find a property like that."

Um...although it might be difficult to spot a Zhodani individual in a
crowd of human Imperial citizens, Zhodani *are* moderately distinctive,
and certain generalizations can be made about "what Zhodani look like."
They tend to be tall and slender (because of the weaker gravity of their
"homeworld"), they have dark complexions, and black hair.  Zhodani have
slightly fewer teeth than Solomani (only 28, I believe), but their teeth
are slightly larger.  There are also subtle biochemical differences,
associated with the ability to digest the protein of their "homeworld." 
Please take this list of Zhodani traits with a grain of salt - I don\'t
have a copy of the relevant C.T. "Alien Module" with me as I type, and my
memory may be in error.

Seems the cast of S:AAB had a clause in their contracts to appear in
other FOX shows if S:AAB ever failed to get renewed.  So far, all of
the major characters have had parts on Fox\'s X-Files and Millennium
(and yes, the better the actor, the bigger the part).

Of course, S:AAB got cancelled and Homeboys in Outer Space got
renewed... I think some execs have been spending too much time staring
off into jumpspace :)

Teeth.  According to Alien Module 4 (CT), Zhodani have 28 teeth, as opposed
to the Solomani and Vilani 32, and the teeth tend to be marginally larger.

Oh, and they look evil - real evil.

  I\'d suggest the above is what most Imperials _think_ the Zho look like,
based on entertainment programs - real Zho probably exhibit variations
similar to current human norms.  I\'ll take a look in my Zho sourcebook and
see if there is any description of the question in there.

 The Atlas of the Imperium was essentially minimalist maps.  You
 got a starport type, and indications of bases, gas giants,
 allegiance, and whether or not the world was a desert.  You
 also got a name on the HiPop worlds.  But that was it.  No jump
 routes, no names except as indicated, no UWPs, etc.

 Your system is a straight multiplication of HG by 10.  This
 starts out proportionately far below the Official T4 values,
 and rapidly climbs extremely far above them.  A not-much-more-
 difficult conversion would be to use (HG*5)+15.  That would
 give the values in the following table (yours and HG included

 multiply by 10 to remember.  A more accurate formula would be
 to use (HG*4)+17.  That tracks the official numbers _very_
 closely.  A simple formula to remember, though with awkward
 numbers.  And it doesn\'t involve going through FF&S to obtain
 virtually identical results.

offerings, but I do want to make a few comments after my first
look-through.  I was pleased with the diversity of the entries.  While
most ships were in the 200 ton J2 class, the few 300T entries were very
interesting.  Just shows how much the basic components cost - 100T more
size does not add that much to the cost.  I especially liked the 300T J3
design - a bit expensive, but perhaps worth it.

  The following points are preliminary - I\'ll post more detailed notes
later.

1) It appears that most folks took one of two routes to a design.  One
path was the "cheap" route - leave off enough bells and whistles and it\'ll
be cheap enough to maybe make money.  Most of these designs left off
weapons, and all shaved crew in one way or another.  The second path might
be called the "middle passage" path - these ships had lots of middle
passage cabins to generate the revenue needed to break even.  The first
path results in ships that are dull from a roleplaying standpoint, the
second path ignores the passenger generation table in the T4 rulebook.
Only planets with pop 9+ generate more than 10 middle passengers on
average.

2) The single best idea I saw was the folding fuel tanks.  I didn\'t
think of it, since my head is in Classic Traveller, but for a trader
operating in an area of high stellar density (like the area around Sylea).
I\'ll probably add this to my next design, along with the robot crew
members.

3) I noticed some errors in my own Generica Starships design - I really
need a commander, so an additional stateroom is in order, as well as a
workstation.  Fortunatly, there is room - since air rafts are now 1 ton
rather than the tradditional 4, that extra space can go to accomadating
the commander.  Since the thing lost money anyway, no big deal as far as
the economics goes.

4) I think my design was closest to the CT Far Trader, though some others
were in there.  Looks like most folks decided not to have two turrets -
lasers suck power, and the powerplant costs money and cargo space.

  Overall, very interesting.

(for those who don\'t know TeX, each & means a tab, so there are
basically 5 columns)
 
So according to my table (and the Zhodani book), Zhodani have eyes
of any color, red, grey, blonde, dark brown or black (dark seems more
predominant, but yes, THERE ARE BLONDE ZHODANI AFAIK!) and olive
skin.

The "Passenger Bug"
	Along the same lines as Steven Bonneville\'s excelent analysis of
passanger demand... when going over the THUDD entries this morning, I
noticed that several of the designs relied on large numbers of passengers
for revenue. Worse, many relied on large numbers of _middle_ passengers.
While this makes for a great on-paper profit, checking the "real world"
shows that even 12 middle passengers is a bit optimistic unless you\'re
going with the TL gradient or have a decent ship\'s steward. Relying on
twenty, (or fourty, for the budgetliner) is a quick path to financial
oblivion - you\'re unlikely to get this many passengers on any but the
largest worlds, and in these cases you\'re probably competing with Tukera. 
Relying on high passengers isn\'t so bad, because you can almost always
fill the staterooms with _some_ sort of paying customer on almost all
worlds. Of course, Highs are more expenisve, both in space and in crew -
which I suppose is the reason why many designs decided to focus
exclusively on Middles.

I\'ve got the CT supplement and your memory nailed it. There are slight

They started shipping to distributors last Friday.  Should be in 
stores...whenever the distributors get them there. [G]

As for S&H costs, just a reminder to look into the changes on that 
front.  Check out IG\'s web page.  And subscribe to the newsletter, where 
they talk about all that stuff! :)

M0 was edited by Les Smith.  Additional editing/layout by Tony Lee.  
Illustration and design by Ashe Marler.

So, no, nothing has changed on that front.  The new crew starts on book 7 
and beyond.  Look for changes in future volumes.  Since CORE finished 
writing M0 the first week of November, this was all done under the old 
management (with the exception of Marc and Tim stopping the printing 
process to switch out the Core sector data from M0 to make sure it 
matched First Survey, since CORE had been told to go ahead and make the 
Core sector data on our own and FS would be changed to match..then that 
didn\'t happen, so it had to be fixed at great cost to IG).


M0\'s known errors:  

1)  AAB organizational chart compressed to 1 line, so it makes no sense 
    (and put in a sidebar, so it is highlighted, making it even worse).
2)  Vilani Confederaton org chart compressed to 2 lines, so it makes no 
    sense.
3)  Scout Cruiser deckplan was not included in the book.

Stu and I will shortly ask IG for permission to post the deckplan, and 
the original org charts, to their web site.  Although we had no control 
over the editing, layout, design, etc., we want to ensure that the 
information that we meant to be in the book is available.

There probably are short, stout, fair-skinned, fair-haired Zhodani, but
the Zhodani are all descended from a single small group of human beings
transplanted by the Ancients, so Zhodani are a whole probably *do* look
more alike than, say, Solomani, or the average product of the great
Imperial melting pot. Are there any Minor branches of Humaniti in the
Consulate?  If so, they might contribute to Zhodani diversity, but I\'m
pretty sure just about all Zhodani are primarily descended from humans
from Zhdant. 

Diverse or not, however, everyone knows that Zhodani really *do* look
evil.  Yes, even the pudgy, pale, blond, blue-eyed Zhodani.  ;)

No, I don\'t think you\'re missing anything.  I do the best I can to make
sure that Pilots also have some astrogation skill and that Astrogators have
some piloting skill.  This way the Astrogator and Pilot can share the
duties of running the Bridge.  In fact, on a small ship one of the Bridge
crew is also probably the Command position.

While in Jump space if you don\'t have some technical skills, and can keep
busy maintaining the ship, you probably spend a lot of time reading,
playing games, watching videos, and sleeping.  A lot of learning might go
on out of sheer boredom. <G>

I *really* like DGP\'s Starship Operator\'s Manual, so I\'ve used my 
variation on how they describe what it looks like. From the outside, as 
the jump grid is charged, gridlines begin to glow blue around the ship, 
like the ship was enveloped in blue mesh, the brightness of the gridlines 
increasing until the entire ship is enveloped in a white-blue "haze".

From the inside looking out a viewport, the observer sees what appears to 
be blue glare.

EM sensors would read very energetic energy levels, exotic particles 
would be detected with the proper equipment.

>What does an observer see when a ship enters J-space?  If a crewmember were

As the ship enters jumpspace, the blue glowing spheroid that is the ship 
blinks out. A super-slow-mo replay would reveal that the spheroid 
actually appears to contract until it disappears in a point of blazing 
blue light. The event takes in the order of a few milliseconds.

On the inside, the star field with glare from the grid disappears, and is 
repaced by an undulating grey "nothingness", some crewmembers experience 
a brief "wrenching" sensation, and some even get nauseous.

>3. Once in J-space, what, if anything, do crew looking out viewports see?
>What sort of sensor readings does the ship get?

The crew just sees hazy greyness. Sensors cannot penetrate the shell that 
envelops the ship, so only detect the particle cloud that keeps an 
N-space shell within Jumpspace.

>4. If energy or matter is introduced to the N-space-J-space boundary, what
>happens?  Could this endanger the jumping ship?

Matter which passes through the boundry is irrevoccably lost. Energy that 
disrupts the field could have the effect of causing a misjump and/or ship 
destruction.

>5. If for some reason the N-space bubble drops while in J-space, what 
>happens?

The ship "drops" back into N-space. If the bubble\'s disappearance is 
unplanned, and not the one accounted for in pre-jump calculations, the 
ship misjumps.

Note that my interpretation of jumpspace is that normal matter *cannot* 
exist within jumpspace. The "shell" enveloping the ship contains a normal 
space bubble which can travel through the jumpspace medium because the 
"shell" simulates a particle that *can* exist in jumpspace. (The obvious 
candidate for simulation is the theoretical Tachyon, whose *lower* limit 
for speed is the speed of light)

Therefore, things chucked into jumpspace don\'t stay there, they end up 
somewhere in N-space. Hey -- this is a good thing for maintaining entropy 
in the universe, yes?

If the field surrounding the ship is disrupted non-uniformly, *parts* of 
it could precipitate into normal-space, hence the possibility of 
explosion and undesiribility of this occurance.

>6. When a ship re-enters N-space, what do observers (on and off the ship)

Again, a "wrenching" sensation may be felt, and the grey "fog" dissolves.

>7. Are the different races\' and manufacturers\' jumpdrives sufficiently

In DGP\'s SOM, it is described that different races use different 
geometries in creating their Lanthanum Grid, with Imperials being the 
basic square mesh pattern, Droyne using a hexagon chicken-wire pattern, 
Aslan pretty swirly whirls and spirals, Zhodani use a triangular grid, 
Vargr, random every-which-way, etc.

So, an observer could watch the geometry of the tell-tale glow, and 
determine the Race, and even the manufacturer, if the manufacturer uses 
an identical grid pattern for its ships. ie. x distance between 
gridlines, at an angle of such-and-such to the ship\'s main axis...

   S:AAB was sci-fi along the lines of Battlestar Galactica--in fact
it would be fair to call S:AAB, "The Battlestar Galactica of the 1990s".

   Both shows were attempts to bring serialized mainstream sci-fi to
the small screen.  In both cases they would have been better off being
broadcast as a series of several "Movies of the Week" per year rather
than as an one hour weekly series.  The cost of both shows made it
impossible to justify their production, despite their considerable
(though not considerable enough) hardcore followings.

>Of course, S:AAB got cancelled and Homeboys in Outer Space got

   With any luck, BG and S:AAB (and Space Rangers and several other
shows I could mention) have finally taught the rest of Hollywood what
the makers of Star Trek and Bab 5 already know: sci-fi TV series simply
don\'t work on mainstream, American network TV (CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox).  The
pressure to get rating *and* show a profit for the network is simply too
great.  

   As an aside, this same rating/profit pressure is also why it is
becoming increasingly difficult to find *anything* (sci-fi or otherwise)
watchable on the major American TV networks anymore.  My understanding
is that the situation in other parts of the world isn\'t much better
(Baywatch anyone?).

Man those Zhodani chicks look hot in their cute little goatees!  ;->

Humans were transplanted about 300,000 years ago, right?  My
question is just how \'homo sapiens\' were we that far back?

The Zhodani could be Neanderthals for all we know...and so could any of the
transplants.

Even if they are Cro-magnons, homo sapiens, or modern humans they certainly
didn\'t have the same diversity in their gene pools as the original stock. 
They certainly didn\'t evolve under the same
conditions or in the same way.  I rather suspect you aren\'t going to find
classic earth human racial types among the Zho or the Vilani. After 300,000
years the various transplants might not even be
cross-fertile.  

Sure, the number of fingers, toes, eyes and ears will be the same, but
skin, hair, and eye color will probably vary a lot.  Imagine green or blue
tinged skin, true violet or yellow eyes, or pink (and not dyed) hair.  Why
not?

I have no idea when its going to show up at FLGS\'s, although it

Well, the new professional layout person that IG is hiring/has hired 
(don\'t know which), didn\'t work on this one.  The book was worked on 
by the old IG staff.  As for layout, there are a few more sidebars 
(and more relevant ones) than previous efforts.  I\'d say layout isn\'t a
radical departure from previous T4 offerings.  Full page, full page 
text.

	Yes and it was very rare for me to ever get a player with a
 skill level above 4 before T4, but the T4 skill advancement system 
is too generous.  This charecter left charecter generation with Fast 
Talk-3 and Pilot-4 but in one session he Fast Talked a Vargr into 
believing that Fred was going to kill and eat him (possibly not in that
 order) (the ref ruled that this was of staggering difficulty given 
that Fred also has to smell as if he were a sociopath) so he used an
 experience point to test Fast Talk & raised it to skill level 4.  Now 
if Fred were a MT charecter he would not be able to get another check
 in Fast Talk for monthes, but in T4 you can raise your levels without
 this limit.  So the very next month (playtime & realtime) Fred Fast
 Talked a mob guy into buying a stolen jail for use as a space habitat.
 (see the Captain was locked into the jail which was a 90 ton portable 
building & we did not have intrusion skill so we just stole the jail &
 flew it into the 125 ton hold of our Subsidized Merchant at 30mph 
(another staggering task & the source of the check giving him
Pilot-5)) & this earned Fred another check in Fast Talk.  So in less
 than 60 days he went from Fast Talk-3 to Fast Talk-5 - This would not
 happen in CT or MT or TNE.  Since it is easier to raise skills in T4 
each level is now worth less.  In the same time period one of the other
charecters in the party went from Astrogation-6 to Astrogation-9 or so.

	No I have not played him for that lon I would say that Fred 
picked up more skills in 6 monthes of play & 1 year of game time than
 one of my previous charecters Sigrid (using  TNE & MT) did in 10 
monthes of play & 2 years of game time & she was the one who ran into
the ancients 2 or 3 times, discovered their secrets, crossed the Great
 Rift the hard way, got knighted, learned all 6 Psionic Powers,
 survived a 12dice shotgun blast to the heart, saved the Imperium
 & ended up as the head of Emporer Strephons (a close personal friend
 nudge, nudge, wink, wink) Guard ....

	In contrast all Fred ever did was run a merchant ship & engage
 in some Espionage albeit under strange circumstances.

	Yes and he would have been a god in any of my previous campaigns
 but in T4 it is too easy to advance in skill too fast.  I would suggest
 that after you go up a skill level you may not be allowed to try to 
raise it again for (90 x Skill Level days) at the very least (maybe 
180 x skill level days in a more realistic campaign.

	Not really it is not that hard to roll a two 6\'s out of 12
 dice & T4 will let you make this into a 12 stat.  Then simply 
getting lucky in mustering out (6 terms & only 1 roll on the cash 
table) gave him +2 Int.  It was even easier to get an EDU of 13 all
 you do is start with an Edu of 7 average, go to college (+4 Edu) 
and get 1 +2 roll in Mustering out.  You also need to be aware that
 since T4\'s aging is less harsh than in previous versions of Traveller
 that you are likely to see charecters who are somewhat older. (Not
 that this is a bad thing but it is something to take into account).
  During these terms they have probably raised their charecteristics
 even more.

	But under T4 charecters do get better than this & too fast.
  I probably could have had him up to Fast Talk-8 & Pilot 6 within 
another 6 monthes of play & this rate of advancement is not realistic.

	The rules say that even for the most talented (I read this
 as charecteristic F (15) and highest skilled (I read this as skill 
level 12 ) charecter in the universe imposible tasks should not be
 a sure thing.  I interpret this to mean that the even this charecter
 should have a less than 50% chance of success.  This is probably why
 our opinions of what the success chances should be differs If we 
use double skill and half attribute we get a target number of 32 or
less ((2 x 12) + (0.5 x 15)).
This means that the task needs to be rolled on about 10 dice for him
 to have a less than 50% chance of success.

	In T4 the odds of rolling a critical failure go up by about
 50 % each time you ad 1 die to the difficulty of the task & I agree
 that this is a good system.  What I am saying is that for Impossible
Tasks to really be  nearlyImpossible they need to be rolled on about
 7 dice & this gives a chance of critical failure of over 40% & this
 seems too high to me.  Maybe this is a realistic set of odds but it
seems high.

	I can tell you that in T4 our party experienced about 4 times
 the number of Critical Failures as similar parties did under earlier
 forms of Traveller AND at the same time had a much better chance of 
success at much harder tasks (barring Crit Fail\'s) than under previous
 editions of Traveller.  Fred could expect success at 7 dice Fast Talk
 tasks & I am pretty sure that I probably thwarted the refs plans (Hi, 
Will.)  sometimes by doing so well.

	 I would suggest that If you want to use a variant of the T4
 system that perhaps we should need 3 6\'s for critical failure (I\'ll
 ignore the religius implications of this & hope everyone else does
 the same.) 
> 
> Kenneth.

	I think your system is better than the standard system & goes a
 good way towards correcting the T4 task system, but it does not go far
 enough.  T4 can be made to work adequately & it has some semi neat
 gimmicks but I do not intend to bother, for my purposes a modified MT
 is much better.

For Mileu Zero/First Survey, does Sylea get moved from the subsector

Traveller"? Or does it stay where it is in MMT/T4?

And if it **does get moved**, is there any sort of explanation given? 
Some folks had hinted that this would be the basis of an adventure (this

	Zhodhani space includes a number of what used to be Imperial worlds in
the Spinward Marches.  In The Spinward Marches Campaign (by Marc Miller)
on page 14 there is a map of the Imperium at the eve of the First
Frontier War in 589 which clearly shows that Imperium controlled many of
the world in the Cronar (A), Jewell (B), and Querion (E) Subsectors
which are conquered by the Zhodani in the 1st, 2nd & 3rd Frontier Wars. 
It could be argued that these worlds were origionally Zhodhani &
therefore had Zhodani population but the history of the Spinward Marches
settlement implies that these world were Imperial.  We do not know the
populations of these planets at that time yet but by 1105 these formerly
Imperial Zhodani planets have a population in the billions (some of whom
are presumably full blooded Zhodhani whose families settled here after
their conquest, er, um, liberation) but many more of whom must be
Solomani, Vilani, other human minor races, & mixtures thereof.
	
	Therefore the Zhodhani Consulate has access to a pool of hundreds of
millions of people who will not scan genetically as Zhodhani who will
make good spies.  At the Tech Levels common in the Imperium it is childs
play to do genetic scans.  One of the assumptions I have always made is
that Imperial Military (&some civilian) facilities regualarly scan their
visitors (note that this scan will not only check to see if you match
your paperwork but if you are what race you are) & if a Zhodhani is
detected he or she is in trouble unless they can produce very, very good
documentation of their identity. I do not think that the Imperium lets
in very many Zhodhani immigrants (although this might be a good
background for a Soc 2 charecter).  The descendants of former Imperials
however can waltz right through this sort of test & pass unnoticed in a
crowd.  Moreover we know that these worlds were culturally absorbed into
the Consulate because none of them are listed as unabsorbed worlds (the
Zhodani equivilant of Amber Xones, the worlds that do not follow
Zhodhani culture).

Ahh, that explains it.  I think the xp system is broken too.  
Traveller has never had a good eperience system in any version, but I 
believe that MT\'s was the best.

This has been a topic I\'ve been thinking about.  Pretty soon, I\'ll 
get around to doing some work on it.

That\'s an idea worth considering.  I\'m also playing with the level 
limits that used to be imposed in CT and MT.  I know that T4 says 
that there are no level limits, but what I have in mind is to use the 
limit as a gauge for making it harder to increase the number of 
skills you have.

For instance, a character has an EDU 7 and INT 7.  In both CT and MT, 
this character could never learn more than 14 levels of skills, or 
put another way, all of his skill levels could not add up to more 
than 14.

What I\'m thinking about doing in my game is to use this level as a 
guide.  As long as the total skill levels this character has stays 
below 14, normal (or whatever I come up with) xp rules will apply.

When the character\'s total skill levels are between 15 and 28, then 
it will cost twice the amount of xps to go up a level.  At skill 
levels of 29+, if he ever gets there, the cost will be three times.

As you can see, this thought is not totally fleshed out yet, but that 
is where my thinking lies right now.

Again, this is where our play styles differ.  I give each of my 
players one chance to roll an attribute on 2 dice.  That\'s it--just 
one roll, and they have to live with the result.  If they want or 
need to improve a stat, then they are going to have to forego a skill 
level and try for a stat increase on the appropriate table (I let my 
players choose the table to roll on, but they have to roll--not pick 
what they want from the table).

Thus, some of the characters in our group are quite weak in some 
areas.  One has a STR of 2!  But, we have turned that into a neat 
role playing situation.

In my game, skills would never reach level 12 because the character 
would be dead by that time.  As I said to you before, I have never 
seen a level 8 skill in my games, and only one level 7.

I think the xp system is broken, but from what I\'ve gathered about 
T4, the skill levels have about the same value as they did in MT and 
CT.  This level 12 stuff is TNE thinking.

How do I back that up?  Well, all the things about T4 are basically 
the CT rules with a few tweaks here and there--not the TNE rules.  
And MT was just another tweaking of the CT rules.  I think that CT 
and MT are fairly compatible with T4 (and I sometimes make TNE stuff 
compatible too, but it takes more work).

For an example of this, look at the description of the Medical skill. 
 It states that a character is considered a doctor at level 3--just 
like in CT, just like in MT.

If medical could reach level 12, then a doctor would be more like 
level 5, or 7, or maybe even higher.

No, I think that the value of the T4 skill levels are the same as 
they were in CT and MT.  

But, you are right, too.  The xp system is broken and doesn\'t reflect 
this relationship.  That\'s why I\'m going to fix it in my game.

If you skills don\'t get too high, to level 12 and such, the 
percentages I listed are pretty good for Impossible skills.  You\'ve 
got to remember that most people will have, say, an attribute of 7 
and a skill level of 2.

This give you, under my system, a target number of 8.  And on the 5 
dice system I use for Impossible tasks, this is only a 0.72% chance 
of success with a 19.62% chance of SF.  I\'d say that\'s quite 
impossible, and that\'s where I\'ve been coming from promoting this 
system.

Hey, I like the religous implications.  It suits a critial failure.  
And, this might not be a bad thing in your campaign.  In my game, SF 
with the two 6\'s is below 10% for all difficulties of Formidable and 
below.  Staggering is just over that at 13%, and Impossible carries a 
pretty hefty chance of SF at almost 20%--but that\'s how it should be 
in my book.

That 64.98% chance of success on an impossible task is the problem.
It is the Whole problem, and nothing but the problem.

Also, Under MT as written I frequently encountered characters that could
not make ANY impossible tasks, and some that could not make them even with
extra time....

Under T4: all the PC\'s, using Pick table, roll on table chosen method for
skills had at least 3 skills at level 4, and all but 2 of the 9 PC\'s played
(all generated legit except the skipper, who had too many terms, and
highest skill was a 4, BTW) had a skill at level 6+ at start of campaign.
The Doc had Medical 4 after Med School (2 from Undergrad, 2 from Med
School, 2 more from his 2.75 terms of service, for start of 6). 3 of the
characters had Level 8 in one skill.


Under TNE: There was a commonly used house rule (at least in Alaska) of
maximum TNE skill level 10, and cannonically attribute limits at 15 (very
rare) for 25 base asset, and x1/4 for Impossible= 6= 30% chance of Success
maximum, with a 40% chance of CritFail check resulting, with a 40% x 5% =
2% chance of actual Crit Fail, and no chance of Crit Success, using all the
bells and whistles of the task system, as in Ref\'s Screen and Mk1Md1 TNE

Under MT: DM+3 attribute maximum, DM+8 maximum ever, crit-fail is fail by
more than 1 point. Impossible needs a 19 or 20, which gives an absolute
maximum chance of 3/36, or ~10%, No Except. Success (would need a 21, which
means a 12 roll with a +9 DM, illegal), and the ridiculously high chance of
Except-fail of 30/36, or ~83%. HOWEVER, not all Exceptional Fails are
really "Critical Failures"; as MT then checks for mishap. Also, MT has a
flat 2.7% chance of failure no matter how good you are.

MT can be cured by changing exceptional-fail to being natural rolls on the
following table
	Diff		Easy	Avg	Dif	Form	Imp
	CF on NR	no	2	2-3	2-4	2-5
	% CF		0	2.7	8.2	16.7	27.7

T4 is problematic in that chances of success and failure are NOT intuitive,
NOT easy to calculate, and NOT reasonably low at a level that is
effectively one higher that the higest in previous rules-systems.

If a modified MT task system like what I posted were to make it into T4
Deluxe as an option, I\'d be much more apt to give T4 another try, or at
least reccomend it. I realize that some GM\'s don\'t want their players
having a clue about how good their chances are, but the GM should at least
have a clue. Under T4, I didn\'t. I was the GM. This meant that the Skill 8
astrogator with Int and Edu 15 was NEVER FAILING TO SUCCEED. Fortunately,
none of the players chose to use OFFENSIVE skills (Weapons and brawling
skills) as the primary focus of their characters. They all chose to focus
on the job they wanted ship-board.

You need an astrogator for the same reason ships and planes need
navigators. Real-space *and* jump-space both require some moderately
complex calculations to avoid wasting fuel or running into things.

Even with thrusters, you still have to worry about *orbits* (though
mostly the orbits of *other* bodies. You can\'t just aim the ship at a
destination and go. You need to know where the planet/station/whatever
*will be* when you get there. And what your trajectory looks like as
modified by gravity so you can check it against other ships and bodies
in the area.

The astrogator is *very* busy from the time you come out of jump until
you are settled on a course to the jump station/high port/planet. First
he has to figure out both where and when the ship is, as well as it\'s
current velocity vector. Then he needs to find out if they are about to
hit anything, and plot a safe course towards the area covere by local
traffic control. Then he and the pilot need to talk to traffic
controlabout other ships and what sort of course changes traffic
control may want.

After they have the approach course set, things are *mostly* in the
pilot\'s hands, but the astrogator has to be available for both course
changes and to be sure that traffic control hasn\'t goofed and given
them a course that collides with something, or goes thru a restricted
area (like a naval weapons range!!).

When getting ready to leave a planet, the astrogator has it a lot
easier as he doesn\'t need to determine *where/when* the ship is. He\'ll
still need to have updated his "charts" with the latest info for this
system and any others they plan to visit. And he\'s still responsible
for making sure they don\'t run into anything or go someplace they
shouldn\'t. 

After takeoff, he gets to continually update the jump calcs based on
where it looks like they\'ll hit the 100 diameter limit, and (if he\'s
smart) also figure an "emergency" solution based on jumping ASAP. 

Once the ship enters jump, he and the pilot can review the drive logs
to see if the jump went ok, and then go over any problems they had.
Then they can take their time reviewing the data on the destination
system. 

But they\'ll both be at their workstations sweating, when the earliest
likely jump exit time comes around. And they\'ll stay there until they
actually *do* exit jump. Then it\'s back to the bit I described above.

It\'s *not* "a few hours of work".

Not possible with digests... They are in the MIDDLE of the digest. Theyre

we will not just the CT/MT, TNE, and M0 types here, but also M200(aslan
wars), M600 (civil war), M800 (solomani rim war) backgrounds.

I feel/believe/suggest that the milleaux should each have separate lists;
leave TML for system mechanics and gearhead tinkering. I\'d quit TML if
X-boat was working (and aimed at the CT/MT rules and/or settings, even if
it also covered TNE), and I am sure that I\'d not be the only one. And As
for X-Boat, if it is working, my friends can\'t get on it, and I haven\'t
tried lately.

300,000 BP is just about right on the boundary between Homo Erectus and
Homo Sapien, so the answer is not very. Homo Sapien did not become "pure"
until about 250,000 BP.

Homo Sapien Neandertahalis were between 120,000 BP and 50,000 BP

Zhodani (and Vilani, Genoee, Surreat et al) are probably not Homo Sapien
at all. In AM 4 the genus of Zhodani is given as Homo Zhdotlas, with two
genii predating (Homo Zhdatl and Homo Vlastebr).

	This has probably been already discussed so I\'m sorry if this is redundant
but I was wondering if a neural activity sensor could be blocked by a a
psionic shield helmet or by the psionic talent: shield?  I\'m working on a
research facility that has NAS as part of its security net and wasn\'t sure
what the effects of the above would be.  Would the NAS register as blank as
described under life detection or would it detect the neural energy going
into the shield?

	Thanks for any words of wisdom.

	I think that you will see them a lot sooner than you expect if you do
not do something about the T4 charecter generation & experience gain
system.

	We know that the maximum limit on skills is actually 13 because when
testing for skill advancement a roll of 6 will gain you a second die to
roll (T4 rules pg 159).  You need to equal or exceed the current level
to rise in level.  Since the roll of 2d6 cannot exceed 12, you can never
raise a skill above level 13.

	The description of an Impossible Task (which I think should be renamed
Nearly Imposible)  says (T4 Rules pg 49)  "Even the fittest (Stat F),
best trained charecters in the _galaxy_ (emphasis added) have trouble
accomplishing deeds of this magnitude."  I think that the rules of the
Task System _need_ to reflect this description.  It does not matter if
you or I ever see a charecter or NPC with Skill Level 13 in
our campaigns, it is a big galaxy & they are out there somewhere.

	The system will let you go up to level 13 it is just that they _meant_ 
each level to be worth the same.  But since T4 allows more skills during
charecter generation & makes each skill level much easier to gain
through experience, each level is worth less.

	If charecters have more skill levels, each one will be worth less.  It
is sort of like the classic (monetarist) definition of inflation - "More
dollars chasing the same ammount of goods." (Milton Freidman-
paraphrased).  Since in T4 the average charecter _will_ have more skills
each one IS worth less, even though that does not seem to have been
their intention, which was probably something more like "Hey how can we
make charecter generation easier & provide better charecters, hey how
about 1 skill per year ?"

	Yes but the system does not _say_ that Impossible Tasks are nearly
impossible for the average Joe or Eneri on the street, it says that
Impossible tasks are challenging even for the best in the galaxy.  Mybe
that is why they are called Impossible, because they are impossible to
most charecters.

	Yes it is the problem, there is too high a chance of success at very
difficult tasks in T4 & you cannot fix this except by raising the number
of dice so drastically that you get critical failure all the time.  In
addition some people are apparently incapable of adding up 7 dice
rapidly & this can slow down play.

	I happen to think that the players should have a sense of their chances
of success.  In real life I know that my chances of pulling a bootlegger
reverse in my station wagon with my Dex=4 & my GroundCar=1 are basically
nonexistant & that is why I do not try. Real people should usually have
a sense of how hard the task they are attempting is.  In addition this
is better for the game because they won\'t have charecters dying all the
time because they act like stupid cowboys.

I can! The generation system is more prone to produce high personal
statistics (10+), and I will admit that though fast talk-6 is high,
primary skill(s) of 3 - 4 are not uncommon.
I am not a huge number crunching stats minded ref, but I do know that
the average roll of 4D6 is 14 (or close to).

If the primary asset is 14, and the average roll is 14, the players are
going to give it a go because it is not that hard.

If the stat is 7, and the skill is one, the players are not going to
worry to much, 8 is not to far from 14.... 

Impossible should mean just that, impossible.

The task system makes it too easy for the players (and npc\'s) to gain a
success unless you make the tasks rediculously hard.

If we apply the same rule of thumb to starships that banks use on
automobiles (since in both cases, the bank owns the vehicle until it is
paid for), you can safely assume 4-5 times the loan period.  (About 20 yrs
for automobiles, 120-150 yrs for starships)  Of course, some last longer
(considerably longer with proper maintenance), and some don\'t last long at
all...

While it is possible that a starship could survive the 1000+ years from M0
to the MT era, I can\'t see it surviving in a commercial environment.
However, a group dedicated to maintaining the \'classic\' starships could
concievably acquire and maintain a number of starships, showing them off
at spaceshows and providing the holovision and epic producers with working
period starships for their productions.

...much as the Confederate Air Force does with WWII vintage aircraft (here
in the US)

dreadfully expensive process that it would probably be easier to just

envision a society with very basic spacefaring capabilities (Tech Level 8) 
retrofitting jump grids to anything spaceworthy as soon as jump technology
becomes available.  The Terrans, for example, might have "upgraded" some
of their "national" interplanetary naval vessels at the very beginning of
the 1st Interstellar War to keep the Vilani at arm\'s length until the
first real starships rolled off the assembly lines.

Personally, I\'d allow "retrofitted" jump drives, but impose various small
but irritating penalties, such as decreased accuracy with respect to the
"break out point" at the end of the jump, a greatly increased chance of
misjumps, more maintenance, a nasty touch of "jump-sickness" for anyone
aboard, and so forth.  Better than nothing, yes, but not as good as a real
starship.  Opinions?

Yes, it does move.  On the Core map in First Survey, it moves from
1821 (T4 book) to 2118 (First Survey/Milieu 0).  FWIW, 2118 is also
its hex location in the map of Core subsector in the corresponding

Yes.  The Adventure in question is the upcoming IG product Anomalies,
IIRC, which Marc Miller is apparently working on at this time.

Nothing like a little controversy to stir interest.  :-)  
Kind of like all those season-ending episodes in ST:TNG, a little,
ain\'t it.  Show the first part as the last episode of the season in
March, show the conclusion in September.  :-)

OK Scott. Apology accepted. I\'ve posted public what should have been private

I don\'t _think_ so; compare against the

None of the early ship design systems (including those of MT, where the
idea of a "lanthanum grid" was first imposed) made ANY distinction
whatsoever in cost or performance between the hulls of starships and
those of jumpless spacecraft. AFAIK, "Starships" makes no distinction
either. (I have not yet noticed mention of a lanthanum grid in T4.)

Also, the jump tug (described in Supplement 9, CT) can actually tow bulk
ore (which presumably does not come with a lanthanum grid installed) and
non-star ships  through jump space. Supplement 9 does not mention any
possible problems caused by this.

My opinion: judging from design rules, installing j-drives in a ship
does not present any obstacles more serious than those presented by
installing anything else in a ship. Your scenario sounds very plausable.

[regretfully snipping an excellent discourse - I really like the way Mr.
Erickson thinks!]

While I have not seen a specific reference to this rule in T4, in MT is
was stated that if you have a charactor functioning in more than one role
on a starship, he could not apply the skill bonuses to either.  In other
words, if you have a Pilot-4/Navigator-2 functioning as both pilot and
Navigator, you effectively have a Pilot-1/Navigator-1.  (Astrogation was
not a skill then)

That alone justifies the extra body, in my mind.  (Yes, that rule is
active in my campaign)  That is, unless you are comfortable launching with
a Pilot-1...

Another factor in your decision should be this.  The Nav-computer is going
to set up and execute your jump.  Pretty much anyone can set up the basic
jump variables that will get you from system A to system B.  However, the
Nav computer is going to select from a pre-determined number of points for
both the J-drive entry and exit points (based on a complex algorithm using
your launch date and time to ensure no two spacecraft select the same
points) as well as determining your entry and exit vectors.  This would be
mandated not only for traffic control purposes, but also (in case of
emergency) to ease the complexity of a search and rescue mission.

Unfortunately, it\'s also a fact of life that the algorithm has been hacked
into tiny little pieces, and if someone knows when a ship is scheduled to
jump, then someone can place their ship in the approximate location (on
either end of the jump) for interception.

How can this be avoided?  By using the \'for advanced users only\' features
of the Navigation/Astrogation software and inputting vector overrides and
coordinate off-sets!  Who can do this?  Only a astrogator who has time to
sit down and work with the navigation system.

Or go buy a customized navigation program...

Navigator, you effectively have a Pilot-1/Navigator-1.  (Astrogation was
not a skill then)

That alone justifies the extra body, in my mind.  (Yes, that rule is
active in my campaign)  That is, unless you are comfortable launching with
a Pilot-1...

Another factor in your decision should be this.  The Nav-computer is going
to set up and execute your jump.  Pretty much anyone can set up the basic
jump variables that will get you from system A to system B.  However, the
Nav computer is going to select from a pre-determined number of points for
both the J-drive entry and exit points (based on a complex algorithm using
your launch date and time to ensure no two spacecraft select the same
points) as well as determining your entry and exit vectors.  This would be
mandated not only for traffic control purposes, but also (in case of
emergency) to ease the complexity of a search and rescue mission.

Unfortunately, it\'s also a fact of life that the algorithm has been hacked
into tiny little pieces, and if someone knows when a ship is scheduled to
jump, then someone can place their ship in the approximate location (on
either end of the jump) for interception.

How can this be avoided?  By using the \'for advanced users only\' features
of the Navigation/Astrogation software and inputting vector overrides and
coordinate off-sets!  Who can do this?  Only a astrogator who has time to
sit down and work with the navigation system.

Or go buy a customized navigation program...

This brings up a very interesting point, one I hadn\'t really considered
before.  At what point is the lanthium grid added to the ship?  I assume
that it is part of the J-Drive cost (esp. since that is based on the
volume of the ship), since there is no distinction between spaceship hull
costs and starship hull costs.

Based on this, I would tend to see the grid added after the hull is
completed, bonded to the exterior.  Standard starship hulls may be
\'grooved\' to permit workers to easily lay the grid.

So, I see no problem whatsoever about retrofitting jump drives, once you
solve the problems of volume, power and tankage for \'em!  :)

I don\'t have SSDS, so I can\'t say about that. But compared to the thruster
prices in Megatraveller it is a mistake. (I looked in FF&S, but couldn\'t find
them there). Please think about this carefully. Upping the thruster prices by
a factor 14 adds another hefty chunk to starship prices. And aren\'t they
supposed to be an improvement over HEPlaR? I haven\'t made up an example yet,
but I\'m pretty sure that if they are that expensive, it becomes much more
economic to use HEPlaR.

characters a realistic number of skills.  However, madly inflated skill 
levels is a very poor idea.  The T4 system is set up so that with only a 
minor change maximum skill could be 6.  Given that a character can get a 
license to practice medicine with Medical 3 this makes good sense.

As for advancement, it\'s totally broken.  A chance to go up after every
adventure is simply too fast.  A maximum of 1 roll every 90 days of game
time sounds like a good fix here (not one roll/skill, but one roll to
raise one skill). 

Using the 1/2 stat + 2x skill system, with a possible, but high skill level 
someone with a stat of 10 and a skill of 6 is going to have a target 
number of 17.  That means that 4D for impossible tasks is silly (80% 
chance of success).  5 dice is little better (49% chance of success).  To 
me, impossible tasks should be highly risky for even the very skilled.

However, 6 Dice begins to look more reasonable (I\'m not sure of the exact 
numbers, but it\'s around 25%, ie *very* risky).

How about a system with 

2 D Routine
3 D Difficult
4 D Formidable
5 D Staggering
6 D Impossible

This system uses no half dice and gives average skilled characters (stat
7, skill 3) a 92% chance with routine tasks, 50% with difficult tasks and
3% with staggering tasks.  Sounds OK to me. 

Personally I prefer T4 char gen and MT tasks, but that system looks 
unlikely to make it into the formal T4 rules.

As a side note, folks actually *roll* their skills?   We\'ve always picked 
(with GM veto on munchkining).  I tend to start with a character concept, 
the idea of having to revise that because the character\'s skills look 
nothing like the concept sounds very annoying.

That is certainly a more logical way of doing the calculations, it\'s just
that the
QSDS says "One steward is required per 8 high passengers (or command crew), 
***PLUS*** one steward is ***ALSO*** required per 50 middle passengers (or 
non-command crew). Round all fractions up." [emphasis added] The "plus" and 
the "also" just lead me to believe that the commander and high passengers
just refuse to share their cabin boy with the lowly deck hands and people 
travelling coach. If this should be done the other way, then it really needs to
be clarified, as I\'m not the only one who reads it to say two stewards.

(Pay no attention tho that man behind the curtain!)

I have a question regarding the crew position of steward.  Wasn\'t there a 
skill called "Steward" back in CT MT or TNE somewhere?  As far as I can 
tell, a steward is little more than a cabin person,  someone to cook and 
clean and look after the passengers.  A maid or a butler.  Apparently any 
idiot could fill this position, even the Marine who isnt doing anything 
usefull during the 7 day jump cycle.  Are there any aplicable (official) 
skills in T4 that people should consider buying during character creation in 
order that they can land a job doing stewarding?

I have come up with the following house rules.

 Art(Cooking) The person is experienced in the preparing of foods that are 
at least palatable(lv 1) to Imperial Class 5 starburst restaurant (lv 5+) 
 The level of expertese allows the person to know one type of cuisine 
(Sylean, Solomani, Vilani, etc...)

Art (Bartender)  The Art of Mixed Drinks.  Alows making of simple drinks, 
Scotch and Water all the way up to the complex and deadly if mixed 
incorectly  Pan Imperial Starburst!

Acting, not only can this be used for perfoming in a play, but it can also 
be used for a stand up comic\'s act.  Useful skill to have on board a free 
trader, holocrystal videos get boring after a while.  A good lounge act is 
hard to find.

Any idiot can be a cabin boy/girl, cleaning is easy with modern TL-12 
conviences, better yet, buy a bot!

These are unofficial of course, but if someone does happen upon the Steward 
skill in T4, feel free to correct me.  (I get corrected left and right at 
work all the time, It don\'t bother me, unless I havent had my COFFEE!  <G>)

  A       10.5   14     21       429


  Now, I\'m not much a math wiz, so I had to do the calculations by hand
(listing possible rolls and counting all results), but I get some very
different results for the lower pop planets I did.  The following table
shows the percentage chance of a particular number of passengers at
various population levels.  The symbol * means a chance less than 0.5%.
The total chance may not equal 100% due to rounding.


		% Chance of that Number of High Passengers
Pop    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12      ROLL

  What does this mean?  Well, take a look at the High Passengers available
at a pop 3 world.  Over half the time, actually 55% of the time, you are
going to get no passengers at all.  In fact, there is a declining but real
possibility of getting no high passengers at all up to pop 9.  For a pop 4
or 5 world, there is a 51% chance of getting 3 or fewer passengers.   

  The question I have for you, Steve, is that my calculations show that
there is only about a 14% chance of getting the 5 passengers you list in
your table as being average for pop 3 worlds.  Could you explain the
reason for the difference?

Well, we know that the Terrans beat the Viliani Empire based upon 
their invention of:

a) Jump-3
b) The Meson Gun

as well as other minor things like

c) Use of robots
and
d) Advanced genetic manipulation

So, I think it\'s stated (and generally accepted) that the RoM reached
TL12 (sans Fusion+), stretching into TL13 in some areas.

The Solomani Aliens module and Solomani & Aslan both discuss the RoM,
as it\'s a pretty big deal in Solomani history.

But, in the Real World, airplanes *don\'t* need navigators any more; 
the navigator seat on an airplane was pretty much gone by the 1980,
with the advent of decent computers and decent electronic navigation aides
(even before there was GPS.) 

In realspace, the pilot of a traveller ship almost certainly does all the 
navigation tasks Leonard referes to too - calculating the course, 
checking to make sure you haven\'t violated any traffic regulations, etc.
What else is there for a pilot to do in a non-combat/non-landing situation?
It\'s not like the pilot has to sit with his hands on the steering wheel all
the time...

I tend to assume the astrogator deals *only* with jump navigation, and
that it\'s a moderately complicated job, requiring several hours of calculation.
It certainly could be combined with piloting on a small starship, though - 
the only disadvantage would be (a) a pilot/navigator combo might not have
as high a skill in either as a pair of speciallists, and (b) if you get into
combat, you won\'t be able to jump out, as your pilot will be too busy piloting
to navigate.

Or look at James Blish\'s "Cities in Flight" series.  Early in Blish\'s
"future history," Earth\'s economy collapses when cheap interstellar travel
makes it possible for first factories, and then whole cities, to leave

There\'s a big difference between "easily retrofitted", which should be
true, and "cheaply retrofitted" which may or may not be true.

It also makes little sense, since the hull grid isn\'t *that* integral.
There\'s no reason a hull grid *can\'t* be added to a hull that didn\'t
start with one. No need to strip the original hull plates. Just machine
in the "grooves" to hold the grid, then install the grid. It shouldn\'t
be *that* much harder than replacing a grid that has taken major
battle damage.

Given that there\'s an old design for a "jump tug" that uses a *net* of
cables to enclose items to be hauled through jump, I\'d say it\'s doable.

But I think it\'s a much better idea to actually build a grid into the
hull. It won\'t cost *that* much more, and will be far more reliable.

So can I. That\'s why I think it\'s not nearly as bad as you think.

The big problem *isn\'t* the hull grid. It\'s finding *room* inside the
hull for the J-drive and the extrea fuel tankage. A non-Jump ship will
have been built with all the space dedicated to *other* purposes.

I think that fitting the hull grid is tedious, and rather expensive.
But not unreasonably so. The real problem is finding space inside the
ship for the J-drive and fuel. It\'s going to have to come out of cargo
space or (gasp!) weapons and n-space drive.

To properly simulate this, you need to design an *intelligently*
designed non-jump ship. One designed to make optimum use of all the
internal space. Then try to shoehorn a J-drive into the hull. The
disadvantages will appear! Either no cargo, or having to rip out the
existing drive and power plant and replace them with smaller ones. Or
some other compromise.

It\'ll be *worse* than the mess involved in creating a carrier out of a
battle cruiser (done a few times in the 30s) or creating a nuclear sub
from a diesel sub (done a couple of times in the 50s).

What might work better would be taking some old *chemical* propelled
ships (and old NERVA type ships) and converting them to fusion *and*
adding a jump drive. That means you gewt to keep the hull, and much of
the avionics, but you gain space because of the greatly lowered fuel
requirements. Of course, you\'ll be *terribly* under-armored.... :-)

 Actually, the explanation is quite simple - you know those
 misjumps where the ship just seems to vanish, never to be found
 again?  Well, your players experienced one of them from the
 "other side".  The reason that they were never seen again on
 the world that their mission started from is because they
 exited a jump (no way of knowing which one, at this late date)
 in the wrong universe.  All the data that they collected before
 the misjump is unreliable for this universe - but they don\'t
 know it.

 It so happens that they have "alter egos" in this universe who
 were sent on a similar mission (and also misjumped
 catastrophically), so nobody will find their appearance
 remarkable.  But some of the questions that your PCs will as
 are going to get them strange looks - "What\'s the Ordun bloc up
 to in the Senat/Moot?"     "Who\'s Ordun?"

	The Century Class liner represents the Apex of luxury travel

appointments, many built in features, and a steward permanently assigned to
each suite. 

	In addition, there are four Century Lounges, each a 4 star
restaurant in it\'s own right, each featuring different cuisines. The Ship is
cappped with the Grand Ballroom. When in Normal space, the Cover over the
Ballroom opens up to allow a glorious view of the cosmos. Top musical and
other entertainemnt acts are booked for each flight, occupying the remaining
small staterooms, or one or more of the large, depending on their own status.

travel. 

	Each Century class ship is named for a different great era in
history, such as the Renaissance, the Regency, the Barsharkin Interlude, and
often decorated to suit as well. As of this writing there are 7 Century class

	Just remember, these are the very cream of the crop of luxury ships
in the Imperium; these ships are furnished with valulable antiques, lavish
settings, and provide the best food.

	The lasers are there primarily for show...many passengers simply feel
better on an armed ship; these ships typically travel through well-guarded
systems, or on their rare forays into less-protected areas of the imperium,
with one or two Naval escorts.

This leads naturally into the broader question of ship retrofits/upgrades
in general.  In general, this is going to be both hard and expensive;
spacecraft are going to be very tightly built, with componenets fitting
together like puzzle pieces.  Changing the shape or size of a puzzle piece
is going to be nontrivial.  Additionally, interfacing a nonstandard
componenet is likely to require additional hardware to handle power and
data linkage conversion.

Working totally off the top of my head, here is my proposed
retrofit/upgrade rule:

For each component installed on a ship after delivery, calculate its
Compaibility Factor (CF) using the following formula:

For replacement parts (pulling out old unit):
    Start with CF = 1.0
    + 0.2 if either repl. part or ship are not pure QSDS
    + 0.2 per TL difference between part and ship base TL
    + 0.5 if new part takes more volume than old one
    + 0.2 if new part needs more than double the power of the old one

For new parts:
    Start with CF = 1.5
    + 0.2 per TL difference between part and ship base TL

The cost, volume, and mass (if applicable) of the new part are multiplied
by the CF to obtain the actual values for it.  Area, power, and other
ratings remain unaffected. 

For example, adding a TL 11 6-Std jump-2 drive to a TL-10 ship that\'s
never had a jump drive before (presumably bolting it into a corner of the
hold or such, plus adding a lanthanum grid if your universe workds that
way)  would give you...

  CF = 1.5 + (0.2 for a 1-TL diff) = 1.7

So, the cost comparison for the drive (using QSDS 1.5 for the base data)
would be:

               Volume (Std)     Price (MCr)
  Built-in          6.0            25.2
  Retrofit         10.2            42.8

On the other hand, replacing a QSDS TL-11 3-Std laser with a TL-12 3-Std
QSDS model which uses less than twice as much power would look like... 

  CF = 1.0 + (0.2 for 1-TL diff) = 1.2

The numbers for this look like:

               Volume (Std)     Price (MCr)
  Built-in          3.0             1.4
  Retrofit          3.6             1.7

The added volume would be taken up by power and control adaptors external
to the turret.

Ship designers may if desired reserve space for components to be installed
at a later time.  They must specify the precise component being omitted,
and appropriate volume and area (but *not* necessarily power) must be
allocated in the initial ship design for the omitted components.  The
omitted component is then treated as "virtually present" for purposes of
calculating the CF.  This will in turn result in a CF of 1.0 (i.e., normal
cost) if the missing component or a close equivalent is ever installed.
This allows for the classic Traveller practice of designing in 3-ton
turrets and 50-ton bays without specifying weapons at design time, for
example.

Why pay a Astrogator salary and support for a function that can be
performed in a automated fashion?  SureJump Flight Plans are available at
every Class \'C\' starport and above throughout the Rhylanor subsector.  For
a quarter of the base salary of a Astrogator, we will supply you with the
necessary information to navigate to the jump point and perform a
successful and safe jump to the destiniation you specify AND our
software will provide the basic information needed to establish a
standard orbit around the destination world!  As an added bonus, we will
provide ONE FREE update, should that become necessary in-transit!

Worried about that rogue pilot on your salary?  Unfortunately, Sector Law
requires a licensed pilot aboard, and in the cockpit during take off,
landings, dockings or undockings.  However, fully automated control is
provided for, and with our exclusive software package -SureJump Navigator,
that is what you will have.

From a standard orbit, our software will interface with our flight plan
and transport you safely to and from the jump point with no error!  And by
removing pilot incurred variables from the jump plot, you will reduce your
chance of mis-jump appreciably!(*1)

In the unfortunate (but rare!) event of a emergence from JumpSpace outside
the preset parameters of the SureJump software, we now have available a
new module,  SureJump NavFinder!  This software will search out and lock
onto standard orbital beacons, and then automatically plot a direct line
course to that beacon.  Once communication is established with the local
SureJump office, you may upload your course update for a least cost orbit
in! (*2)

While attack in space seldom occurs in real life, we recognise that it
does, in fact, occur.  Our local offices are authorised, upon confirmation
of hostile action, to upload FREE(*3) course corrections as required by
your ship.  We will take you out to the jump point or bring you in to the
planet, AS YOU REQUIRE!

SureJump Flight Plans
For a safer tomorrow!

(*1 - not yet substantiated by statistical evidence)
(*2 - if you have already used your course update, you may purchase a new
course, OAC, and apply this update against it)
(*3 - Course corrections will be charged to your account as stated in our 
service agreement, and refunded, without predjudice, upon confirmation
of attack by an authorized representative of system defense command.)

Why not use gravitational compression technology to create and store 
SuperDense LHyd (patent pending)? The storage unit requires an
uninterrupted power source, which can (and should) be built into the
unit, to reduce the risk of accidental uncollapse.  However certain safety
features can be built in to minimize the chance of a unit going BOOM like
a fusion bomb (due to rapid uncollapse and subsequent compression while
inside the unit).

     Sure, emigration and interbreeding will have made the "typical Zhodani"
more common in the intervening centuries, and most of the Nobles, Diplomats,
and Fleet Admirals (that is, the type who will be seen by Imperials, outside of
the Consulate) will be more "ethnically pure," but I have to imagine that a
sizeable percentage of the Proles on these planets will be of highly-mixed
heritage and virtually indistinguishable from their Imperial adversaries in the
next subsector.  Thus, the potential for "passing" is easier than one might at
first have thought; at least from a physiological standpoint.

    'body' => '     OK, this char-gen/tasks/experience thing seems to be working itself into a
circle since somebody just advocated my original fix (2/3/4/5/6).  As I\'m sure
Kenneth Bearden will probably post sooner or later, that fix doesn\'t work as
well as his (and now my) (2/2.5/3/4/5) because "Difficult" tasks become too
hard for somewhat-lame characters, which I can believe.
     As for character generation, I don\'t see any problems at all.  Sure, abuse
can create super-characters, but what\'s new about that.  As my experience has
shown (about a dozen characters) PCs will generally have one or two skills in
the 4-5 range, a couple more 3s, and lots (~10) 1-2s.  So, the typical PC
(which, it\'s worth pointing out, is not necessarily the same thing as the
typical NPC) will have at best something like Stat 13 Skill 5-- target 18 (or,
if you use the KB version-- which I greatly prefer-- 17), which, even without
the large CritFail chances, puts him below 50% success on "Impossible" tasks. 
Some people think that\'s too high, but rather than completely re-writing the
task system, I think a better "fix" is to call it "Nearly Impossible" and 86
that quote about this being hard for "the best in the galaxy".  For
completeness sake, we can include "Really Impossible" at 10D or something, but
I can\'t imagine that 99% of us really need such a thing.
     Experience, though, provides a nasty problem which I hadn\'t noticed before
(since my actual campaign-style Playing of T4 has been very limited).  I\'d
suggest implementing (in addition to the obviously-needed fix of only adding 5
to the second die roll) both of the so-far-suggested fixes. 1) A skill
improvement can only be attempted once/90 days/current skill level. 2) Once a
character\'s combined skill points exceed INT + EDU, all xp (for lack of a
better term) costs are doubled.  Thus, if Joe Starfighter wants to improve his
Piloting from +7 to +8, assuming he\'s over his limit he\'ll have to spend 4 xp,
have a very slim chance of an improvement, and if he fails he can\'t try again
for a year-and-a-half.  This should pretty Dramatically slow down high-level
advancement, and generally keep the system more in-line with the approx 1
point/year rate from char-gen.  Since I haven\'t actually done any sort of
statistical study on this, nor have I actually put it to use, I\'m possibly
overlooking some semi-obvious flaws, but from where I\'m sitting this double-fix
seems pretty workable.  Anyone care to run some numbers on this?

     So, as a re-cap, char-gen isn\'t broken; the task system is slightly broken
(or at least slightly more "heroic/stat-based" than a lot of us prefer) but
there\'s already a workable fix, especially if we call the 5D difficulty "Nearly
Impossible" and don\'t consider it the be-all and end-all of difficulty; and the
experience system seems pretty badly broken at higher levels, but we\'ve got a
couple of possible fixes suggested so it\'s not fatal.  Assessment: the basic
game system of T4 works, dammit; it just needs a little tinkering here and
there, which is what we\'re here to provide!
     Now if we can only come up with some bug-free and easy-to-use Starship 
Design system that everyone can be happy with....

Trent Smith

P.S. To Kenneth Bearden: After several months, I finally got around to printing
up and reading your T4 combat system, and I like it.  A little more detailed in
some places than I need/want (ie- hit locations), but it combines a lot of the
elements I like from AHL in an easy-to-follow T4 compatible format, which is a
big bonus.  With some slight simplifications, and the "Danger Space" rule
(where misses can nail bystanders in the line of fire) added back in, I plan 
to use this in my games (if and when I run another one, that is).

This is *exactly* what I had in mind.  I thought about the end of the Long
Night, and envisioned a star system inhabited by would-be Pocket Empire
founders - a system with balkanization in its very recent past, and so
close to the lower edge of Tech Level 9 that it still has plenty of
obsolete, but still operational, Tech Level 8 hardware in service.  Using
the old "Book 5: High Guard" rules (the only rules, alas, I have access to
right now), I put together an 800-ton, purely interplanetary "cruiser," 
with (nearly) top-of-the-line performance, albeit for Tech Level 8 (4-G
acceleration, an 88-ton maneuver drive).  Adding 200 tons of external fuel
tanks would bring the ship\'s total volume up to 1000 tons.  Its maximum
performance would drop to 3-G (a 3-G drive for a 1000-ton ship would
require 80 tons, a 4-G drive would require 110).  Installing a 20-ton jump
drive would allow this ship to make to 1-parsec jumps without refuelling
(and required sacrifices, in both the cargo hold and the ship\'s troops).

By ordinary high-tech standards, this wouldn\'t be a very impressive ship. 
On the other hand, even fledgling Pocket Empires have backwater star
systems which need to be patrolled, and even a chunky, sluggish,
make-shift vessel like this one can "keep the peace," and thus help
consolidate conquests, after the Empire\'s limited supply of "real"
starships has eliminated everything capable of putting up a fight. 
Basically, the ship\'s mission would be changed to accomodate the
compromises associated with its partial upgrade.  No, no sane government
would *design* their "patrol cruisers" this way,, but if they\'re
practically ready to go, it makes more sense than mothballs or the
scrapyard...

	Here\'s the "official" answer, at least from when we were creating
SSDS--thruster prices were to be 25% of the price listed in Fire Fusion &
Steel. Yes, they\'re very expensive. It was done deliberately. Thrusters are
more likely on military vessels. I can see many merchant ships going with
either no thrusters at all (relying strictly on HEPlaR/Fusion Drives and
ContraGrav), or with only 1G thruster and HEPlaR auxiliary boosters. And I
very definitely see military vessels carrying both.

	From FF&S, p73, thrusters cost MCr1 per cubic meter, so the SSDS/QSDS cost
should be MCr0.25 per cubic meter.

	So, yes, it may be more economical to use than HEPlaR. The advantage of
thrusters over HEPlaR was never supposed to be the cost, it was the
"unlimited" maneuver.

I use 1/2/3/4/5/6, with 3d6 being average and 6d6 being virtually
impossible (staggering is a better term for what I mean).  I\'d like to add
7d6 or 8d6 for just almost impossible, but that\'s a *lot* of dice.  <g>

Not the way William and Peter build characters...obviously, but they don\'t

That\'s been my experience too, but it looks like that\'s not
universal.  If the players pick/pick, rather than roll/roll then I can see
them ending up with 4 or 5 *very* high level skills and bupkus everywhere
else.

I GM a couple of PBEM\'s and generating characters is a different thing
there, so is everything else for that matter.  <g> I have the player tell
me what kind of character they want and I try to generate someone like that
for them, but I insist on adding in some quirks too.  When I do CharGen
it\'s more a career template with added random skills and some quirkness the
player and I negotiate. I mean when you want a Starship Pilot, you want
Piloting and Astrogation, not Equestrian, and by golly you ought to get it,
but NOT levels like 6 or 7...unless you push up the dice levels.

I tried this before coming up with KBv1.1.  The curve is too steep.  
It is OK for higher numbers, but your characters will fail all the 
time with their lower level skills.  

When designing a task system, you have to watch out for both sides of 
the spectrum.

What was you objection ot KBv1.1 again?   I\'d like to see why you 
don\'t like it.

Roll skills?  I wouldn\'t have it any other way.  This is the way it 
was done in CT and MT.  Any other system is just not Traveller.

With D&D, you can pick your concept for a character.  In Traveller, 
we roll up the stats then start to discover who the character is.  
The char gen system gives you a skeleton and we put the flesh on it.

I think it is the best system for creating characters ever invented.

With the systems, like D&D, James Bond, or Star Trek, where you 
already know what type of character it will be before you roll him 
up, I began to find (eventhough some characters were highly creative) 
that my players kept repeating the same types of characters.  The 
Traveller system is like life.  You may start out one way (and even 
envision yourself that way), but you get thrown a curve ball.

Example.  Recently, I let one of my players roll up a second 
character.  Initially, his fuction was to be a body guard to the 
noble owner of the ship.  

For this role, the player wanted a bad ass mercenary character with a 
lot of combat skills.  Well, we rolled, and guess what.  He didn\'t 
make the enlistment throw in either the Army or Marines.

Damn.  So, the player decided that the character would be a cop.  He 
made the enlistment for Agent in the T4 main book, and we play him 
like a disillusioned looser who wasn\'t good enough to be in the 
Imperial Forces--he settled for a law enforcement job on his 
homeworld.  

This is like the guy who wanted his whole life to be an FBI agent, 
but failed to get accepted and relegated himself to the role of 
security guard.

You know what?  This character we rolled up, the cop, probably has 
more character and role play value now than he ever would have as an 
everyday regular mercenary bad ass.  And, my player probably would 
not have thought to play him that way.

Through the Traveller character gen process, my player is already 
attached to him before he started playing the character.  He has

Any system that can do that has my vote.

Actually, I think the T4 char gen system fixes the problem associated 
with the old 4 year methods in CT and MT.  In those older systems, 
characters generated did not stand a chance compared to a character 
generated with a 1 year method (like in MT for Scouts, Merchants, etc 
or the CT Books 4-7).

I\'ve created characters using T4 and compared them to characters that 
I created using mercenary, and you know what?  They were very 
compatible.  Totally skill levels was usually very close on 
comprobable characters--allowing for variance due to the dice throws.

This is something that I could never say about the 4 year character 
gen systems in CT and MT.

The problem that we are talking about is not the T4 char gen system.  
It is the experience system.  It is not just broken, but it is very 
broken.

If we fix that, then your characters will not be getting level 10 and 
up skills.

As the NAS was developed from early psionic shield helmet technology, I\'ve
always assumed that it detects psions (psionic elementary particles - not
canon, but see the HIWG working paper on the subject), and that\'s just what
the shield is blocking. In my campaign, everyone wearing a shield,
artificial or psionic, will simply not register on a NAS. Also, a shield
will serve as armor against neural weapons fire.

I don\'t think there\'s much canonical stuff about this subject, this is just
how it works in my campaigns, because this is what makes sense to me.

Ah, a target number of 17, under my system, has a 47.71% chance of 
success at an Impossible task to be exact (and thanks for the support 
for my system).

Here, here.  But think about this.  Level 5 is pretty doggone high.  
Maybe not the best in the galaxy, but certainly way up there.  Level 
5 skills don\'t grow on trees, and you still have less than a 50-50 
chance.

Look at this another way.  You have to get up to level 5 with a skill 
just to have a 50-50 shot with the Impossible.  That means those with 
less than level 5 will be closer to a really impossible chance.

 For

Wonderful idea.  There is nothing stopping from slapping more dice on 
the throw if the situation warrants.  If your player bitch, then use 
the tried and true approach--dunck a huge negative DM on the throw 
due to blah, blah, blah to get the target number down.

	"Yea, that\'s right.  It will be an Impossible task WITH a negative 
five DM.  Do you still want to try?"

Glad to hear that.  Actually, though, the Danger Space rule is in 
there.  I just used the CT term instead of the MT one--Group Hits.  
Check it out.  I allotted for this.

As for the detail, I don\'t use it all myself.  I just like it there 
in case I need to refer to it for special circumstances.  Most 
situations are covered in some form or another in those rules, so 
when a special one arises, I know where to look.

The guy\'s got a stat of level of 14--just one below human 
maximum--and a skill level of 6, twice the equivalent skill that a 
doctor has.  Some characters never even see a level 6 skill.

What kind of a percentage would you give this character on an 
Impossible task.  I\'m just curious.

Actually, in MT, natural boxcars always hit, so every character has 
at least a 2.7 % chance of success even if he wasn\'t skilled.

They still *need* navigators. They just don\'t have a *dedicated*
navigator position. And there are folks pointing out that it\'s a false
savings, as a lot of expensive problems come from either trusting the
flight planning software too much, or not knowing how to properly use
it.

Space navigation is rather more complex.

Depends on what sort of course he\'s planning on following. If it\'s a
constant vector, constant boost, run to the 100 diameter limit, that\'s
not a problem. More likely, he\'s going to have to change vector several
times, so as to avoid having vector pointing towards things that won\'t
like it (Most military ships and installations will get *real* jumpy if
your "instantaneous" vector intercepts their future position. Ditto for
vectors that come too close in space or time). And even civilian pilots
would rather not have a vector that would run them into something if
the engine failed (ie you have to keep asking yourself "will I hit
something if the engine cuts out at any point along this course"). So
that puts some extra constraints one course vectors.

Realspace navigation isn\'t "trivial". :-)

As someone else pointed out, if you are doing both jobs, you don\'t get

I just wish I could locate a book I read back in the 60s. It was a
discussion of spacetravel, including astrogation and combat! The
discussion of astrogation is *still* valid (from what I can recall of
it). The combat discussions are ok, except for the understandable
mistake of assuming that directed energy weapons were impossible. It\'d
be an invaluable aid for GMs and players.

Look for Lee Corey\'s "Manna" for a good description of what "space
traffic control" around a busy planet might be like. It has a sequence
where a pilot has to take up a ship during a "period of increased
tensions", and winds up invoking the obscure rule that says he is
taking full responsibility for his ship\'s course and detecting and
avoiding any hazards. It\'s a *very* tense flight from the ground to
geosynchronous orbit.

It also describes the fun of varying "restricted zones", civilian
flights and satellites, military flights and satellites, and the like.
Correy (a pen name for G. Harry Stine, a well known areospace writer)
gets the feel of things across nicely. Probably from his own
experiences as a private pilot.

Another trick is to use the regular jump "point", but with a high
velocity vector in a random direction. That makes matching course with
you a pain.

[snippe-di-doo-dah ...]

Sorry to mix in you discussion. I may sound like a lamer, but I never
think about terms like "routine or difficult" when it comes to rolling
dices.
For me, the number of dices is just a way of "making it physically
touchable" how tough a problem is for the players. And of course I
always look how talented the player are, that try the task, to find out
the appropriate number of dices.

So I tend to do things more intuitively. Of course, if you are not
careful, you can run into discontinuity with a thing like that. So it
could happen, that a player sais:
"Hey, that\'s not fair! When I tried this task before, I needed to roll
just two dices. Now I have to roll three"
But I think, that\'s a problem, one has with every task system. Or do YOU
know (after a few evenings of game), what difficulty a task had, which
you gave the players at the beginning of the campaign? Well, you can BET
on the fact, that the player knows it very well. :-)

...actually a thing, which I play in T4 similarily. It\'s only natural,
that a character solves a problem accidentially. But of course, I alway
do think of a possebility of what could happen if the player fails. This
often keeps players off doing things, they shouldn\'t do.

    'body' => 'Hi,
There has been alot of talk about the SSDS/QSDS rule that shiops under
200 tons can be run by just two people.  I have been thinking about this,
and I think that you can do this, but performance will suffer.
The best example of this is the Millenium Falcon in Stars Wars
Everyso often Han Solo (the pilot) has to stop flying the ship,and
run down and try to fix the engines.  When the ship  is attacked by 
TIE fighters, he has to go man a turret. Also one of the passengers 
mans the other turret. (Luke Skywalker)

This is how I envision the Far Traders that only have two crew members.
THey are constantly running from task to task, they never have enough
time to do proper maintenance and they are always having breakdowns.

In FFS, the numbers of hours of maintence that a given ship needed
was computed based on its mass.  For the Far Trader I built for
THUDD, it was about 120 hours.  It is true that FFS was built
around Low Automation, so some kind of factor has to be used
to reduce this.  Hmmm I guess you can use the same factor that is
used to reduce maintence staff.  

So, I wouldn\'t allow heavily armed ships to get away with only
two crew members.  You can put a very small spinal mount in
a 200 ton ship, It doesn\'t make sense that this could be fired
by the same guy who is piloting the ship.  

I would also not allow Low Automation ships to get away with only 
2 people. They would require the computed number of crew members.
Otherwise all ships below 200 tons would be built with low automation.
And this doesn\'t really make sense.

I don\'t live in Orange County, but I can say that stores may not have 
them yet.  In the past, IG would send the books to distributors first, 
then send books to those who had ordered direct.  Recently they changed 
this policy, and send books to those who order direct first, followed by 
sending them to distributors.  Thus, those who ordered direct get their 
books before anyone else does.

So, the few who have mentioned having M0 and First Survey ordered 
direct.  They should be in stores shortly, but it may be that they still 
haven\'t reached retailers at this point.

They both have the MegaTraveller Chargen Procedure completely

    'body' => '	Starship-V2 design spreadsheet is now available


	What is it?

	Starship-V2 [SS2] is Excel 5 (PC/Win) multi-page spreadsheet 
	for Traveller starship design. It is available in a zipped 
	packet, ss-v2.zip, which contains SS-V2.XLS, SSW-V1.XLS, 
	STARSHIP.TXT, SS2-WALK.TXT and WEAPONS.TXT files.


       What they can do?

	SS-V2.XLS is a starship design spreadsheet which contains all 
	needed FFS tables. Needed starship components are selected from 
	pull-down menus, and the final ship data is shown in "Brilliant 
	Lances", "Battle Rider" and "T4 USP" formats. The ship data can 
	be transferred into text file simply by cut-and-paste.

       SSW-V1.XLS is starship weapon design spreadsheet which contains
       all needed FFS tables. It can be used to design lasers, particle
       accelerators and meson guns.  Weapon options and components are
       selected from pull-down menus, and the final weapon data is
       shown in "Brilliant Lances", "Battle Rider" and T4 formats. 
       The weapon data can be copied into STARS-V1.XLS weapon table.

	STARSHIP.TXT is a short readme-file for SS-V2.XLS.

	SS2-WALK.TXT is a simple SS2 starship design walkthrough.

	WEAPONS.TXT is a short readme-file for SSW-V1.XLS. 
	SSW-V2 is now under construction, so this file is still 
	incomplete. 


       What are the design limits?

	The minimum Tech Level is 8. There isn\'t any improvements in 
	technology after TL-21.

       When the hull displacement is over 100000000 DT, the Excel will
       become more difficult to read when the values are displayed as
       as 1E+08. While it is still possible to design ships that are
       larger than sun, the jump ships are limited by the increasing
       surface area requirements.
 

	How does SS2 differ from QSDS and SSDS?

	Instead of using pre-designed "off-the-shelf" standard
	component packages, SS2 allows the designer to use broader
	selection of components and create tailored ships.

	The density of all components are not the same, and the actual
	mass of a starship will depend on the selected components. The
	average starship density will be somewhere between 15 and 0.07
	ton/m3. Since [ acceleration [G] = thrust / mass ], a heavy
	battle rider will require much more thrust per volume than a
	light tanker.
	SS2 calculates the actual average density of the ship, and
	allows the user to change the density estimate which is used
	in thruster design process. (I had to use separate "actual
	density" and "estimated density" values, since Excel does not
	support recursion.)
	Note that QSDS thrusters are calculated by assuming that the
	average density of starship is ~0.71 ton/m3 (10 ton/DT).


	Where SS2 can be found?

	SS2 can be downloaded from my Web page at

	http://www.ee.tut.fi/~lahtinen/Traveller/ss-v2.zip


       Why it was made?

	Originally I was trying to make a QSDS starship hull designer,
       but the project spontaneously expanded. I felt that QSDS was too
       limited, and so I expanded the original spreadsheet to include
       more and more starship components.
       After I put the first version on my web page, several persons
       mailed me suggestions how to improve it, and the improved
	spreadsheet was called Starship-V1.

	So far I have received over 200 comments, suggestions and 
	bug reports, and after frustrating bug-fixing I decided to 
	rebuild most of the spreadsheet. The result is Starship-V2.


       Is it final version?

       No. Nothing is ever final.

It was called (at least in the Video copy I rented) "World Gone Mad",
starring Bruce Dern as a (surprise surprise!!) Non-psycho but still wacked
out survivor of WWIII who. And if memory serves, and I\'m not thinking of
ANOTHER post-nuclear holocaust movie, it also stars Adam Ant as the head
bad guy. A delightfully bad, low budget flick, wallowing in it\'s B-ness as
all Corman efforts, but is more directly a homage to "The Magnificent
Seven" than the "Seven Samurai", so it\'s a remake of a remake. Of course,
since the "Seven Samurai" was _Kurosawa\'s_ homage to the great American
westerns, the trail of influence is even greater.

This sound an awful lot like CT style gaming that went something like:
"Taking into account your skills, charactersitics and the situation you\'ll
need to roll . . . 8+ on 2D6"
Basically, the reason why Tasks have names is that it enables the GM to select
the appropriate task levele WITHOUT knowing the skills etc of the player.

A task system should work like this:
A character wants to do something, the GM thinks about how hard it would
normally be for a normally skilled person (in real life(TM) if possible)
and sets the basic task level whose
name should reflect the difficulty at hand ie Very easy, Easy, Average,
Hard, Very hard.
For example it is very ease to drive a car but maybe it\'s easy to pocket
park it.
After the GM has decided this he will add any adverse task level modifier
for bad weather etc.
The reason there cannot be any "Impossible" task levels is simply that
impossible means that they cannot be made no matter what. Bad choice of
word. Also, there should probably be no more than 5 levels as more would be
too hard to differentiate between. Quick now, is overtaking a taxi a
"Slightly more than semihard" or just "Semihard"?
Another thing is that ALL tasks should be possible to suceed and fail at no
matter the skill level AND the sucess propability should decrease when
skill goes up et c. I hate stupid rules like snake-eyes always fails,
boxcars always succeed. Finally task systems based on rolling different
number of dice for different task levels fail because Critical
success/Critical failure generally gets more common as the difficulty
increase \'coz the spread of results widen when the number of dice goes up.

Can\'t somebody stop this raging lunatic and make him(me) shut up?
Well, I\'m shutting up for now but the above are my requirements on a
useable task system. If somebody is interested I\'ll write down how it works.

registered, I have only one gripe each for the M0/FS release.

FS:  Where are the subsector names???

M0:  Where is the Character Generation info for either Vilani, Solomani, or
Vargr???

I\'m very pleased with what I\'ve seen so far.  I don\'t have the books with
me, but here is a little review:

FS:
Summary:  Intro Text, Maps for 9 sectors along with both player listings and
referee listings of the UWP\'s.  Player listings only include partial UWP\'s
while the referee listing includes all the relevent extended UWP info.

Positive:  I like the fact that 3 Sectors were left blank, and I like the
player vs. referee UWP listings.  The text intro is very nice.  It is short
and gives a few ideas about how to implement the different maps and listings
into games.

Negative:  I really wish the book had included Subsector names for the
subsectors.  I think the book would have been slightly more useable had it
included only 9 sectors (with 2 left blank).  The additional pages could
have been used to give one or two detailed planetary write-up (in official
IISS format) as well as a few notes on the worlds officially in the Third
Imperium on day one.

Overall Score: 8.5 out of 10

M0: (I\'m only just into the reading of the book, but I have scanned the pages)
Summary: See Stu Dollar\'s excellent summary post.

Positive:  The writing is very good and the material (so far) is helpful in
understanding what the background is all about.  Sidebars are helpful and
relevant.  Not too many pictures, but they seem to be relevant.  (As a side
note, I thought the cover art was extremely appropriate with the recent
discussion of the Vilani and Ancient Sumer.)

Negative:  One of the first things I noticed was the absence of the
deckplans.  Also absent is a NPC write-up on the main players in the early
Imperium.  I would have liked to have seen this on at least Cleon if no one
else.  I\'m not too fond of the font choice, but I don\'t have any alternative
ideas (I don\'t even know why I don\'t like it for sure).

Overall Score: 8.5 out of 10

Comments:  Frankley, I\'m pleased with the continuing improvements of IG.
The main book was poor, then the Starships debacle hurt a lot of the
excitement I felt.  CSC and Aliens seemed to overcome the editing nightmare,
but there was little background info for the M0 setting and the few problems
of dates in Aliens.  M0 and FS seem to have taken another step in the
process, and they do fill the setting void quite nicely.


Finally, just to share the only nightmare I had while reading so far.  After
perusng the pictures in the book, I began reading the first section (after a
tad too much Star Trek probably) and I was dismayed by the vision of a
Klingon Cleon extolling the virtues of honor to the people around him. :)
Like I said, a nightmare!!!

<< Oh yeagh, if you engage the drive at 10 diameters, don\'t forget that
gives a *large* chance for a misjump. It\'s even *possible* to engage
the drive on the ground. But the odds are little better than suicide

My group jumped at 1 diameter once (they\'d made themselves *very* 
unpopular down there...). I said they\'d have to roll pretty high to 
survive. They rolled a 12.

Hey!  What about the actress that played Athena?  In our little gaming
group, we all agree that Starbuck must have been "one thruster short"
to avoid her and chase after Casseopia (sp?).  Come on... Athena was
hot, had a real job, and was the daughter of the fleet Admeral to
boot!

have noticed as most you that the surface area of the jumpdrive eats
away available space as the drives and ships gets larger. Just because
of this I have decided that (in my campaign) the grid is underneath
the hull surface. Thus not taking up valuable space. The reason to
this is that the grid doesn\'t have any surface hit location. And from
what I can understand from SOpM the grid creates a force field that
extends out from the hull. And probalby through it. I there was some
references to the jump space comming into the ship at places where the
grid had failed.

I did also like the proposition someone had on PP radiators. Beaming
the waste heat away sounds neat, and lowers the IR signature and saves
on this precious surface area.

When I read through the chapter on vehicles, I find them less than
satisfying, primarily because they require some work by the referee or the
player before they can be used. I would like to create a set of Vehicle
cards, each with entries on basic data. When a group uses a vehicle, they
would consult the card which would tell them basic performance data, etc.

The following vehicles are a fair sampling of what we can expect to find in
operation within and around the Imperium. These are the standard vehicles
based on official Imperial plans or templates or available models. Limited
variations to these designs are tolerated to allow local manufacture.
All Imperial vehicles operate using fusion plus; they can operate on airless
worlds. Unless specifically stated, the interior of the vehicle is not sealed
for airless worlds, and occupants would need to wear vacc suits on such
worlds.

A vehicle card draft layout is attached as a Word for Windows 95 file.

These are the data fields I envision for the vehicles.

Well, some comparison notes on skill levels per term, base plus bonuses:
CT: 1-2 per term, +1 per each: Commission, Promotion
	range 1-4 per term
MT: 1-2 per term, +1-2 each: Commission, Promotion, SplDuty
	1-8 per term, normally 2-4 per term
TNE: 1-4 per term, doubled on Special duty, plus 1 each for commission and
promotion.
	1-10 per term, diminishing with age, weighting out to 2-6 per term
T4: 4-6 per term, +1 each: Commission, Promotion, Special Duty
	4-7 per term (careers with 6 base don\'t have Commission/Promo).

this shows clearly that MTis roughly 1.5 times CT, TNE is double CT, and T4
is expected result of 6 per term, putting it over MT or CT by 1.5 - 2
times; and t4 is on par with TNE for skill levels. Also, TNE assets are on
par with, or slightly lower than, t4 assest, due to easier methods of stat
gain and higher starting atts (1 pt).

I still maintain that it\'s the pilot that\'s going to do these things, not
the navigator - otherwise there\'s nothing for a pilot to *do* in non-landing
situations - or do you think that union rules require the navigator to calculate
whether the course is going to hit someone and the pilot to input the new
course into the ship?

(And, in the real world, it\'s going to be computers that perform these
calculations, not people, and *anyone* will be able to use the computers -but
Traveller is admittedly a low-automation universe.)

My point would be that on modern aircraft the navigation job is sufficiently
low-workload that the pilot/copilot can do it; similarly, the realspace
navigation job on a starship is so simple that the pilot does it. (Or, 
alternatively, the piloting job is so simple in realspace that the pilot has
plenty of time to navigate.)

I\'d like to see a reference - the airlines seem pretty happy with 2-seat
aircraft (at least to the extent that all the new designs like the 777
and the 737-600/700/800 are 2-seat), and the FAA is sufficiently happy with
planning software that (under pressure from the airlines) they\'re
transitioning to free-flight (aircraft pick their own routes) rather than
old-fashioned aircraft-fly-along-airways navigation.

Can\'t answer that one.

Marc\'s original outline called for none of the above.  CORE decided that 
putting in chargen and data for Vargr made sense, and in fact was pretty 
important to the M0 setting.  Someone along the line decided to remove 
that portion of the book and replace it with the TML-generated "Rumors" 
chapter.  I can only assume the decision was made for the best, and that 
we\'ll have a Vargr alien module sometime soon.  Regardless, since Marc\'s 
outline didn\'t call for a Vargr alien module, I can only say that whoever 
made the decision to axe that section was perfectly within their rights 
to do so, whether I agree with it or not.  That is, I\'m not bitching 
about our work being changed per se; I just wish Vargr info had been 
included for those who don\'t have the previously-published material.

As for Vilani chargen, I was told long ago that the standard chargen 
process applies to them.  I assume the same goes for Solomani, but I 
don\'t know.

to easy.  With a Skill of 6 (quite high, but possible) and a
characteristic of 12 (also quite possible) you\'ve got a total of 18. That
gives you an over 50% chance of succeeding at an impossible task. 

I tend to see impossible tasks as really quite extreme.  Basically,
anything more difficult I simply do not allow character to attempt. 

A good example would be "While hanging upside-down on a ladder, held on
with my legs hooked through the runs of the ladder, with a flashlight held
in one hand and a pistol in the other, can I shoot the dimly lit moving
shape in the warehouse below."  (A edited version of an actual in-game
event).  *No one* should have a 50% chance to succeed here, it takes all
the fun out of it.  20-25% is the absolute maximum I\'d want for this. 
Similarly, as someone mentioned earlier, Impossible fast talk rolls get
damn silly if they can be made 40-50% of the time (and 40% only takes a
skill of 5 and a stat of 12). 

The fact that difficult tasks become... well... difficult for PCs with
more average totals is a bit of a flaw, but not as much of a problem as
easy Impossible tasks.  My best fix (and the one I now use) is the MT task
system, it doesn\'t have any of these bugs in it.

My favorite house rule for Character Generation is this.

Attr:  Roll 12 dice and pair them to 6 attributes.

Skill:  Take the number of skills recieved and divide by 2 (rounding 
down).  This is the number of skills that can *picked*.  All 	others
must be rolled totally random (EG.  Roll for which table 	and then again
for the skill)
	
	*picked*  ==> Any skill or cascade may be chosen.  (NOT AN 		Attribute
increase or decrease).  

In this way you can have a basic concept in mind for the character and
have your character come out resembling the concept but still allow for
the *random* events in life.

  as much hydrogen as an equal volume of empty space.  Working
  from there:

        How fast can you get that hydrogen into and out of the
        block, and under what conditions?

        If the I/O speed of Ti is sufficient to allow it to be
        used as primary fuel storage, then this should be the
        canonical method of fuel storage, as it would permit
        better space utilization.  If it is _not_ sufficient for
        primary fuel storage, then for a comparatively small
        space penalty, one can increase the range of a vessel
        without needing external drop tanks, and all of their
        associated problems.  For example, take the classic
        100td Scout.  This has 20td of fuel storage, sufficient
        for Jump-2.  With an additional 2td of titanium fuel
        blocks, you extend the range to J4, or J2-out-and-back
        with no fuel panic problems out there.  It is only if
        the I/O speed of Ti is so low that a ship that uses this
        method gets fewer jumps per year that the idea fails -
        and that means that filling the block takes longer than
        skimming and refining.

        How much does titanium cost?  If the price is less than
        ten times the price of conventional fuel tankage per
        unit volume, then it\'s a bargain, subject to the I/O
        speed issue above.

        If it\'s not Ti that does this, but the effect _has_ been
        demonstrated, then we can always use "fuelblock alloy"
        for this.

NO.  And here\'s my reason.  If a ship want\'s to reduce manpower they
must double up on job duties.  So if the pilot is also the astrogator
then when the person goes to make jump calculations the ship must
maintain course.  It\'s not as if they\'re doing two jobs simaltaneously.  
HOWEVER.  FOR ships that have a gun slaved to the pilot controls I do
the following (eg. Fighters or Small Scouts).  Increase TO-HIT
difficulty by 1 level.  Also both PILOT and GUNNERY have the their skill

both would be level 1 skills for combat purposes.

ALL THE ABOVE IS SIMPLY IMHO.  ANY IDEAS OR CONTRARY BELIEFS WOULD BE

Would these be APCs, such as the M-113, or Infantry Fighting Vehicles, like

Because the laws of physics don\'t work that way. 

Above a certain temp, you\'ll never even get the hydrogen to liquefy.
Though the density may approach LH2.

Below that temp, you\'ll get LH2 with sufficient pressure, the pressure
required going down as the temp does. 

With lower temps you can get hydrogen "ice". LH2 will solidify to
*some* extent under pressure at temps *somewhat* above freezing. 

And at very high pressures you get metallic hydrogen...

All of these are mutually interdependent combos of temp, pressure, and
density. You can plot them as a fairly simple set of surfaces in a 3d
graph. 

Metallic hydrogen is only going to get you about 1.4 tons of hydrogen
per displacement ton. 

To get anything denser than *that* you have to overcome the mutual
repulsion of the electrons in solid hydrogen. That converts the
hydrogen to "degenerate matter". Which requires some rather *extreme*
pressures (like the center of the sun!). 

Worse, as degenerate matter, the nuclei *can* fuse. The rate is low,
but it doesn\'t take much to start a thermal runaway. As the temp
increases, the rate increases...

But the pressures required to store hydrogen as degenerate matter are
not going to be economical.

You\'ll also be violating the law if the *pilot* doesn\'t have the final
say. And I\'m not sure I\'d trust an automated package to avoid other
ships, military avoidance zones, etc.

A direct line course is rarely a good idea. What if the beacon is
almost on the other side of the star? You\'ll get *awfully* warm.

Worse, what if the beacon is in the next hex!

Right. Uploading course corrections during a battle? Aside from the
fact that light-lag will result in your ship manuevering like a drunken
cow, a bit of jamming will prevent the upload. Can you say "sitting duck"?

Or worse, the pirate will just ipload their *own* "corrections". :-)

Hi Marc,

Wow, what a list!  As long as you\'re planning on doing umpteen vehicles 
<G>, why not add:

Car / Compact
Car / Subcompact
Watercraft / Hovercraft
Watercraft / Speed Boat
Watercraft / 2-Man Boat (motorized & oar-driven versions)
Watercraft / Canoe
Watercraft / Battleship
Watercraft / Tug Boat
and lots more watercraft...

I know I\'d use watercraft in my campaigns.  And the two smaller car types 
lend variety to the list of non-military land vehicles.

My particular solution to the generation hassle is the following:

	Attributes: 12D6, pair up as you see fit.
	Skills: Whenever a skill is determined, may either:
		Choose a table and roll on the table, or
		Roll for table and choose a skill.

This actually tends to minimize the min/maxing without the players
feeling that they have no say in the character\'s life.   They\'re 
still coming up with the 10 level 1, 3-4 level 2-3, and 1 or 2 level
4-6 skills mentioned earlier, for older characters.  I have a few
characters in the low 30\'s who don\'t have that level of skills.

just my 2Cr worth.

Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have developed all-plastic
rechargeable batteries. They currently have 2.5 V cells that they hope to
improve to compete with 3v lithium cells within several months, and
commercial applications soon after that.  The cells can be made into flat
sheets that can be cut and molded to any shape desired. 

Because they have no heavy metals, or liquid electrolyte they promise to
be much more user friendly and safer to use than current battery
technology. As a forinstance, they could become part of the case of a
portable computer, freeing up a lot of space.

I\'m not sure it matters (hey, at some point this is a game :) ), but if, as
I assume, the method of storage in titanium is either by using it as a
clathrate or adsorbent, I\'m hard pressed to see a 10x increase in density
over liquid hydrogen.  I could be wrong, but I hink liquid H2 should be
about the best density you\'ll get for hydrogen.  

In either case, you get the hydrogen away from the titanium by running a
small electric current through it.  This has been used as a safe way of
storing hydrogen for h-powered cars.  I\'m not sure how fast it becomes
available, but for the sake of TL10+, and given sufficient surface area in
the tank, I think we can say "arbitrarily fast." :)

Currently, titanium is expensive.  Last I heard, a car-gas-tank-sized
storage tank full of titanium powder for storing hydrogen costs on the
order of $30K.  Of course, if you could find a titanium-rich asteroid or
two...

That part (and only that part :-) of the T4 task system makes some sense 
to me, at least the critical failure bit. If I were to try an Easy Task 
in Real Life (tm), like riding a bicycle, if I fail, I would expect it to 
not be too traumatic.

If I try a Difficult Task, like riding a bicycle with one hand on the 
handlebars down a steep hill with a 2 cm layer of ice while carrying 40 
lbs. of groceries on my back, I expect to have a higher chance of really 
botching things up. Y\'know, breaking a leg or something.

In the game, a critical failure means different things depending on the 
specifics of the task attempted, but I like the way the chance of really 
messing things up (ie. critical failure) increases in proportion to the 
difficulty of the task.

My question:  Did I miss something in the T4 rules that would have prevented

ballots in is Sunday.  Results so far are interesting; several different
perspectives and degrees of harshness in rating have been expressed, but
there are a couple of designs that everybody seems to like...


        2) As Paul is apparently a little bit busy these days, if he has no
objections I\'ll coordinate the second THUDDD, and let somebody else take it
over after the second one (unless Ethan wants to take over in which case
he\'s welcome).


        3) Given the voting on the first THUDDD ship selection (which
resulted in a close race between the Merc Cruiser and the Far Trader with
the Far Trader winning), and given the fact that the commercial feasibility
requirement seems to have produced a slew of unarmed econoboxes that all
look alike (I produced a couple of these, and broken ones to boot so I\'m as
guilty as anyone else), I think that the next THUDDD ought to be on
something a little... less peaceful.  I shudder at the thought of what
X-TEK is going to unleash upon us.

        So, barring objections from Paul or Ethan, we\'re going to be doing
the Merc Cruiser.


        4) I think that we ought to spend a few days bashing over mission
requirements.  Here\'s my initial attempt:

1) Be affordable by your average planetary government or megacorp.

2) Be able to transport a significant number of troops (suggestions,
anyone?) plus vehicles and equipment, and provide neccessary repair and
maintenance facilities for said troops and vehicles.

3) Be capable of ship-to-ship combat.

4) Be capable of getting the troops onto the ground in the face of enemy
fire, whether by drop ships or landing.

5) Be able to provide fire support (ortillery or otherwise) for said troops.


        5) Lastly, I think that the prize for the Second THUDDD ought to be
a beautiful ASCII iridium-plated rock personally autographed by Sir Arameth
Gridlore... if Sir Arameth is willing, of course :)

You should do the comparison to the 1 year method in CT Books 4-7 or 
in the MT PM for Scouts, Merchants, Mercenaries, and Naval 
characters.  The number of skills earned each term is about the same 
as what you\'ve listed for T4.

This is why I said that T4 fixed the old 4-year methods in CT and MT.

Put simply, T4 characters generated with the 4 year method are 
comparable with characters generated in the CT/MT 1 year methods.

Contradict each other?

The success chance should DECREASE as skill level goes up?
So, level 0 characters should have the best chance of success?

What the heck are you saying anyway?

My question to you is:

What percentage chance would you give a character with skill-6 and 
stat-12?

In this situation, I would referee the game like this-

It definitely is an Impossible task.

There should be, and I would assess, an additional negative DM for 
the unusal circumstances.  I\'d give the player, say, a -9 because 
he\'s hanging by his feet, not steady, has to crane his neck up and 
around to see, is starting to feel fatigue in his neck and back 
muscles, and is not bracing the pistol while he is swinging.

Matter of fact, a -9 DM to the task throw might be a little generous 
given the situation you\'ve laid out.  I might even make the character 
make a 2 dice Dex check (Dex score or less on 2 D6) to even get into 
a position in which to make the shot.  I picked -9 because I figure 
your situation is at least as hard--probably more so-- as a person 
trying to inflict triple damage under ideal conditions (see pg. 59 of 
T4).

Under my system, your character\'s target number would be 18 (DEX-12, 
Pistol-6).  This would be modified to 9 with the special circumstance 
modifier that I applied.  I think a modifier like this appropriate in 
this case, especially since modifiers are applied to task throws for 
much less severe circumstance--target size, movement status, light 
conditions, etc.

With a modified target number of 9, under my system, the 5 dice 
Impossible task would only have a 1.62% chance of success, and he\'s 
got a 1 in 5 chance of royally screwing up--maybe shooting himself 
in the leg or hand, or falling off the ladder, or whatever.

Yes, your situation was just about impossible, but I can see a 1.62% 
chance of success for a person with a 12 Dex (just 3 points below 
human max) and a level 6 skill (very, very high--twice the expertise 
of a medical doctor).

Given this, my 5 D Impossible system does work.

  My best fix (and the one I now use) is the MT task
> system, it doesn\'t have any of these bugs in it. 

The MT system is a good system.  It was my system of choice before 
T4, but the thing I like about T4 is that you get the full benefit of 
your attributes with it.

Every point of your stat (or in the case of my system, every other 
point) increases your chance of success.  In MT, there are only three 
benefit points--at a stat of 5, 10, and 15.  

You can only improve at +1, +2, or +3 due to your abilities.  In T4, 
you get maximum benefit of every point (or every other point).

Let me ask you a question.  In MT, what is the difference between a 
Dex 6 and a Dex 8.  The answer to this, realistically, is not much.  
Both give you a +1 on your task throw, and so does Dex 5, 7, and 9.

Under T4, the difference is 2 whole points of benefit, and every Dex 
increase increases your chance to hit.  Under my system, you still 
get a better increase with each Dex level although it is only half 
that of the T4 system (by design).

This is one of the things that convinced me that T4 had a superior 
system to MT, and believe me, I was an ardent defender of the MT 
system.

   As T4 has so much errata at this point, what\'s another batch? 
Apparently the writers just downloaded the various sector info from

along to IG.  The level of ignorance about basic Astronomy among

   Given that the stellar generaton system is about to change, you may

Actually this shows me that T4 character simply have more skills that CT
or MT characters.  As I see it, CT character had pathetically few skills. 
Given that 3-4 was defined as professional level (a profession Naval
Architect had skill 4, a doctor needed Medical 3 to get a license...) Most
character were rather limited, one-note, characters. 

MT made this notably better, and T4 has finally given character enough
skills to be realistic (we\'re often playing highly trained PC\'s in their
mid-late 30s, they should have more than the 12-16 points of skills MT
usually produced. 

As a basic trend in gaming the number skills characters have has gone up
in the past 20 years.  However, skill level 3 is enough to become a
licensed physician and I see no reason at all to change the meaning of
skill levels.  True, characters are no longer compatible, but they can be
adapted.

   Well Casseopia did have certain...umm...skills that Athena lacked. 
Unfortunately she could no longer make money performing them so she took
up nursing.

   Besides, do you really want to incur the wrath of Commander Adama
when you dump Athena for some other skirt?  Starbuck wasn\'t exactly the
one woman man type until Casseopia settled him down (a little).

   My vote is for Sheba.  She can fly with the best, handles a blaster
with ease, endures hardship and separations without complaining, and is
reasonably easy on the eye.  All the qualities you are looking for in a
mate when you\'ve got Cylons constantly on your tail, and you never know
when your shoreleave will be...interrupted.

Do you really want your pilot to be flying the ship, lining up the com

functioning of *all* flight-critical systems *and* generating your jump

Yes, a lot of these are probably going to be highly automated, especially at
TL 14 or 15, and on a ship with a really awesome computer system, the pilot
can probably *do* everything at once. How many Free Traders have
military-standard computer systems, though, or civilian systems that would
be robust enough to handle all the tasks that *might* be needed? One
overworked individual can get you there, probably, if the rest of the crew
comes down with Rigellian Death Flu or something, but I never let my players

A point I haven\'t seen mentioned here before that seemed fairly obvious to
*me*, at least, is that the flight crew won\'t spend that time in jump just
watching holovision. They\'ll have shipboard duties, like standing instrument
watches, and they\'ll also be running a *lot* of simulations, to keep their
skills sharpened, since everybody\'s butt depends on them getting things

I was wondering what everyone allows "the ship\'s computer" to take care of

leeway for independent action. I require sophont action for sensor scans,
communications, course changes, jump vector generation, instrument watches,
damage control, and many other things.

I\'ll let the computer handle "dialing in the com laser onto the spaceport",
or "selecting the proper radio frequency", but if you want clearance to
orbit, you have to ask Traffic Control yourself. I won\'t let a player say,
"Computer, give me a complete sensor scan, and report any anomalies"... if
he wants to scan for something, he has to do it himself. I\'ll tell him  the
results based on what he tells me he\'s looking for, and where, and on his
Sensor Ops roll. After all, the definition of "anomaly" is pretty broad,
when you think about it....

I require the astrogator to be much more involved in jump vector plotting
than simply saying, "Jump vector for Efate, please, Computer." I won\'t let
the computer make any course changes except to avoid collisions... if you
program in a course that takes you through the middle of that BatRon on
maneuvers, the computer will let you. After all, *you\'re* the one whose
piloting license will get lifted!

During the week in jumpspace, if possible, I leave one crewmember on
instrument watch at all times, just in case of an emergency... I don\'t trust
an anti-hijack program to properly interpret a wandering passenger, or to
notify the captain in case of a medical emergency, for instance. There are
so *many* things that can go wrong on a spaceship that I don\'t think it
would *ever* be a good idea to entrust your lives to a computer sytem if you
could avoid it, unless AIs are developed, which brings up a whole \'nother
kettle of fish.

  We can expect titanium to be cheap enough to be available
for starship use.  Cost of fuel tankage isn\'t a direct cost
comparison factor - I can\'t buy extra conventional tankage
to increase my range.
  The I/O problem, if one exists, could be partially avoided
just like running purification - do a bit at a time;  jump
on normal tankage and spend a week refilling from your "sponge"
to make your next jump.
  This creates a new set of background problems - like couriers
that can cross the Great Rift, spy ships or commerce raiders
that have virtually unlimited range, and all the attendant
changes in background politics and economics.  My next campaign
will probably involve mass-calculation based ship design and
operations, so compression becomes largely counter-productive.

	This charecters chance of success on an Impossible Task for a charecter
with Skill=6 and Attribute=14(E) should be about 0.5 %.  However what we
are now calling an Impossible Task should be renamed Nearly Impossible
and this charecter should have about a 2 or 2.5% chance of success. 
This is possible using my Task System.  This Task System is a Modified
MegaTraveller System & it owes some credit to similar systems others
have posted.  Here it is.

A New Task System for Traveller:

	Dice Rolling Procedure:  Roll 2d6 for all tasks.  On a natural roll of
2 or 12 roll more dice.  

	On any roll of 12 you  roll 1 more d6 and add its result to your total,
if it is a 6 you roll another d6 and add it to your total, keep rolling
as long as you get sixes.

	On any roll of 2 you must roll 1 more d6 and subtract its result to
your total, if it is a 6 you roll another d6 and subtract it from your
total, keep rolling as long as you get sixes.

Modifiers To Tasks

	Most Tasks are a test of an appropriate skill & an appropriate
attribute, some tasks may require a test of two skills.  Modifiers to
the roll or the basic difficulty of the task may be made (basically the
MT system)

	Your skill level is a positive modifier to the task roll, add +1 to
your roll for every level of skill. 

	Your natural talent (attribute) also modifies your roll, but is not as
important as your training,  add one third of your  _current_ attribute
level (round down) to your roll, as summarized below.  (The charecter
sheet you use should include a space for this.)

	There is _no_ limit to the possible positive modifiers on a task,
however maximum skill level attainable is level 12.

Attribute	Bonus to Skill
0		You Cannot try this task & if the stat is anything but
		Psionics you should be dead or badly wounded
1		+0
2		+0
3		+1
4		+1
5		+1

	Task Difficulties

Simple 			4+
Routine			8+
Difficult		12+
Formidable		16+
Staggering		20+	(Some "Impossible Tasks" should really
				 be Staggering)
Nearly Impossible 	24+	(Most "Impossible Tasks" are really
				 Nearly Impossible)
Impossible		28+	(This refers to a task which should
				 really BE Impossible)
				(To have a chance to succede at an 					Impossible Task (without
rerolls) you 					will need a Skill Level of 11+ and a 					Statistic of
12+).

	Most Tasks may be done Hastily at +1 Difficulty Level.
Most Tasks may be done Cautiously at -1 Difficulty Level,  the Referee
may require a Routine (or harder) Determination Check (Endurance &
Intelligence are the modifiers) to be patient enough to complete a
Cautious check.

	Most Tasks require the skill listed those few that do not should be
listed as Unskilled Okay.  If you are Unskilled you may attempt the task
but at +1 Task Difficulty Level.  Optionally for some Tasks the
Unskilled Penalty may be +2 or more task difficulty levels (Nuclear
Physics, Brain Surgery & the like).  If Task Difficulty increases beyond
Impossible, it may not be attempted.  If it is attempted (by charecters
who don\'t know how hard it is perhaps) the Referee should make it an
automatic Critical Failure, be cruel.

	Any unmodified roll of less than 0 is a failure.  If the modified roll
on the task would normally makes it a success it is a regular failure,
but if the modified role is a failure it is a Critical Failure. Any
modified Task Roll that fails by 4 or more points is a Critical
Failure.  Heartless Referees may make any critical failure 1 level worse
for every 4 points you fail by.

	Any Modified Roll that is 4 or more points greater than that needed for
success is a Critical Success (unless it is the Unmodified roll was less
than 0 as seen above).  If you make Critical Failures worse depending on
how much the charecter fails by you should make Critical Success\'s
better in the same way.

	Lets take a look at a few sample tasks using this system.

	An average person attempting a Routine Task in their one of their
fields of skill will have an attriblte of 7 or 8 (+1) and a skill level
of 2 (+2) for a total bonus of +3.  They will succsede on a 5+  (83.3%
of the time) and fail on a 2-4 (16.7% of the time) this rate of failure
may seem too high however I am explicitly assuming that most day to day
work is Simple, or done Cautiuosly.  They will get a Critical Success on
a 9+ (27.8% of the time).

	When a charecter with an Attribute of 14 (E) (+4) and Skill Level 6
attempts a Nearly Impossible task, he has a total bonus of +10 and needs
to roll a 24 or better.  This means he needs to roll a 12 on the task,
which allows him to roll another die & then roll more anything but a 1
on this die. 12 (roll) + 10 (bonus) +2 or more = 24 or more. His chances
of sucess are 5/216 or 2.3%.

	I have not looked at every combination of skill level, attribute & task
difficulties but this system seem right to me.

	By allowing no limit to the bonus you reward charecters with high
skills or attributes.  By allowing additive rolls on a 12 it becomes
possible for any charecter to complete any task if they are lucky.

	The group I was playing in once jumped their ship out from inside the
High Port (while some of the party was on the hull ! - fortunately the
Jump field forms 1 meter out from the hull),  and on another occasion
Jumped out while inside a Zhodhani ship that had just captured us.  We
managed to survive both times, but I really do not think the rest of the
(less familiar with Traveller) party realized just how lucky we had been
/ how stupid they had been / how nice the Referee was being.  My
charecter, who was the Engineer, critically failed the Formidable Task
to determine what kind of misjump this was going to be (by looking at
the jump entry data & comparing them to previous misjump data) and
concluded that this was the sort of jump where the jump field interacted
with the inside of the ship & drove its crew homicidal during jump. 

	 She then failed the difficult Determination check to remain cool in
the face of this knowledge.  Since I was already playing her with
paranoid tendancies she started to stick to herself, would not talk to
her ship mates, started wearing Combat Armor on ship, started eating
only sealed ration packs & water, told the Captain that she knew we were
all going to die horribly, & refused a medical exam.  She explained that
she knew we were all being driven insane.  At this point the ships
doctor, whom the charecter did not know was Psionic, used his Telepathy
to reasure her that everything was going to be alright.  Her response
was  "So the voices in my head are reasuuring me that everything is
perfectly normal and this is supposed to make me fell better !?!"  The
Doctor made his roll to control her mind, so she stayed calm until we
came out of the misjump, on day 14 after a jump 35 that took 6 monthes
in the real universe.  Once she realized a telepath had messed with her
mind she promptly went out and secretly had a Psi Shield helmet
implanted in her skull as cyberwear. (see Fire Fusion & Steel for
details)  She never would admit she had it or explain why she come back
from the crew vacation during annual maintenance with her head shaved.

When proof-reading the original T4 rules I advocated that the EDU
alterations should be halved and combined with a maxing-out rule, but this
wasn\'t put in... since 2d6 is a bell curve, by definition achieving higher
stats isn\'t a linear process, so moving from 11->12 should be much more
costly than 6->7. In such circumstances I would suggest that during college,
for a EDU12 player, you give them the option of +0 to +2 EDU, say, and give
them 4 - (adj to EDU) extra skills, to allow that they were so learned, that
they didn\'t really need to spend too much time in lessons, and instead went
out and socialised (my players would choose +0 EDU and Drinking-4 skill...) :-)

Fleischman & Pons used palladium for their Cold fusion experiments but some
of the guys here in Uppsala used Ti instead mainly because it is so much
cheaper and still has about the same hydrogen packing abilities.
Remember that while displacement savings will be huge you\'ll also increase
your mass by a lot. If jumpfuel depended on mass or perhaps both then
hydrogen packing in solids wouldn\'t be an issue:
J-fuel equals 0.007 tons per Jn per max(volume(KL) of ship,mass(tons) of ship)

This may pose problem for canonical heavily armored ships as by this rule,
any ship that doesn\'t float will have its J-fuel consumption increased.

So the laser battery - one laser turret each - is 4x more powerful at
every range band than the PA turret - which is a 5 ton barbette in the
original design if I remember correctly.

When I faked up a design for this (I haven\'t found PA rules I like - esp.
the FF&S ones) I made the PA something like 5,3,2,1 and the lasers
something like 2,1,1,0 or 1,1,1,1.  Under any circumstances, the PA should
be doing more damage than the lasers at any range except perhaps the
longest.

How does your conversion handle these weapons?

Did they jump at one *diameter* (one planetary radius *above* the
surface) or one *radius* (from the surface)?

It\'s more like a clathrate, but with a far higher ratio of "trapped"

LH2 is not very dense. That\'s why most hydrogen compounds are so much denser.

Titanium isn\'t expensive because it is *rare*. It\'s expensive because
it\'s hard to convert TiO2 to Ti metal.

It\'s rather slow after the first little bit. If you want fast, you have
to use convulted layers of Ti foil or Ti "sponge". And that ups the
amount of empty space being used.

Don\'t forget that one "td" of Ti weighs 56 tons (Ti masses 4 tons per
cubic meter). That\'s a rather massive fuel tank you have there. :-)

Absorbing and releasing hydrogen tends to crack titanium, too.

Well, it\'s a _Mercenary_ crusier. Generally, I don\'t think you\'re
going to see whole mercenary armies - it will be a small number of
well equiped, well trained people who will provide support in terms
of training, leadership and heavy weaponry to local armies.

Thus, I feel that the number of troops needed to be carried will be
fairly small - 50 to 100. I wouldn\'t want to run into them in an alley,
but they really couldn\'t mount a military campaign on their own.

Meson bombardment, here we come...

Anyone else have \'Knightfall\', where the adventure starts with orbital
meson bombardment (er, meson blowing-up) of the starport dirtside?
Realistically, few planets will be rich enough to have deep meson
site to defend themselves. Some will have meson screens to protect
key areas, but a lot of planets will be sitting ducks against even
bay meson weaponry. (Wait, are there meson bays? there wern\'t in High Guard,
where there? I need to keep all my stuff at work...)

Oooohhh... cool. We\'ll be ISO 9000 certified. I\'ll hire a human resources

Anyways, I\'m glad to help, although I don\'t think I can really go so
far as to co-ordinate the whole thing, at least not this time. I 
understand that this is job-huntin\' time for you school-bound people
though, so maybe next time...

Change how?  What\'s this referring to?

And as long as I\'m asking (I haven\'t been here long) what\'s THUDD?
Could those of you rampantly using TLAs (Three Letter Acroynms :) ), once 
in a while refer to their actual meaning?  

Thanks.

Oh, and if there _is_ any cool shareware (other than the recently posted
spreadsheet) for chargen, ship creation, stellar generation, etc., I\'d
_love_ to get ahold of it!

What about the idea that jumpspace has currents or some sort of ebb and
flow (I\'m thinking of something vaguely like Niven\'s jumpspace).  IMO, a
jump shouldn\'t just be a week spent yawning and checking your watch.

Maybe I\'m just bent this way, but has anyone ever considered having
encounters of one sort or another _in_ jumpspace?  Having a partial failure
of jump systems ("we\'ve lost lateral controls, Captain!") and risking a
misjump if your astrogation skill rolls aren\'t made, getting caught in
currents or "rapids", encountering beings that live there, or TL17/Ancients
ships or civilizations glimpsed or even found there?  As a player I finally
learned to spend that week practicing skills or (better) digging through
the computer for relevant info, but it always seemed to me it could be used
for something more exciting from time to time.

 <Snip: some very good approximations of the official conversion>

Thanks for the response. The approximations you suggest are all very
good ones. Unfortunately, the problem (as I see it) of converting HG
armor values to T4 is not one of finding a good approximation. You see,
HG has exactly 22 different armor values available to ships of TL15
(0-21), so a lookup table will suffice nicely, no approximation is
necessary. The problem is, if you go by the official conversion
formulae, that the ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM armor available in HG comes out to
be 99 in T4. While 99 is a high armor rating, I don\'t believe that is
corresponds to a maximum at TL12, much less TL15.

While T4 does not supply an ABSOLUTE maximum on the armor factor of a
starship, it does yield a sort of effective maximum. At TL15 according
to T4 (extrapolating the tables with a power law), if you devote about
half of a 100,000-ton ship\'s volume to armor, you can get an armor
rating of 210. In HG, if you devote about half of a ship\'s volume to
armor, you\'ll get an armor value of 21 (at TL15). So 210 seemed like a
good effective maximum to me, and zero seemed like a good minimum, so my
arbitrary conversion table was born.

The root cause of the problems in the HG-to-T4 armor conversions, as I
see it, lies in the old HG-to-Striker armor conversion which equates any
given HG armor value with some constant thickness of steel. HG armor
scales as a constant fraction of starship volume independent of size.
Obviously, this is not true of steel-plate thickness, which will not be
independent of starship size. 

Obviously, the HG-to-Striker conversion system is completely arbitrary,
since it makes no physical sense. I prefer (for reasons of game balance)
my own arbitrary conversion system, which also makes no physical sense.
A system which WOULD make physical sense would be something like:

1) Multiply the HG armor value by the ship displacement.
2) Multiply result #1 by some play-balancing factor.
3) Using the "Starships" USD table, cross reference result #2 to get
result #3.
4) Multiply result #3 by some factor (say, 10).
5) Voila! the number you have now (#4) is the T4 armor value.

Obviously, the choice of the play-balancing factor in step 2 will be
crucial. My guess is that an appropriate value may be found in the range
of PBF (play-balancing factor) = from 0.01 to 0.1.

Not a bad system, if I say so myself. But not much better than an
arbitrary look-up table either; the added complexity of the system
outlined above adds little to the game. It does serve to prevent
small-craft abuse by gear-head players, but that\'s never been a problem
in my campaign, and it can be easily curtailed by a referee\'s interdict.

Food for thought.

Hmmm. I disagree. In T4, you get a skill every year. In books 4-7, you
get a skill every year you get a decent assignment and make a skill
roll, which is about 1/2 the time. So on average, I\'d guess T4
characters have about twice as many skills as book4-7 characters.

Also, there\'s that college thing. In T4, you get an ATTRIBUTE INCREASE
(much better than a skill with the new task system) every year PLUS a
skill every year you spend in school. Then, there\'s the second career
rules; CT characters had only one career. You fail re-enlistment, your
skil increases are over. In T4, your skill increases do not effectively
end until your player says they do. T4 characters are much more
high-powered than CT characters overall.

When I take NPC\'s from old CT products, I double all their skill levels
to keep them from being underpowered with respect to my players\'
characters.

battery off of CNN Interactive, and my little gearhead mind got thinking.  I 
got out my copy of 3G3 and saw that a 3v battery at tl-8 generates only 
about 250J per gram.  and most batteries are much larger than a gram.  So a 
fatutzed and fudged around a bit, advanced the real life late TL-8  product 
to about mid TL-9 and came up with this new product.  I wonder If Mr. Porter 
has any plans to impliment this new tech in either 3G^3 or Emperor\'s 
Arsenal.

TL-9 Plastic Battery
All rates are per cubic centemeter.

0.5g
500j storage
5j/sec max discharge rate

For example a cell of this plastic 1cm square and 10cm long (10m^3) would 
have 5KJ of energy stored within it and power something up to 50Watts for 
100seconds before recharge, or a 50 Watt weapon with 100 charges,  and only 
mass 5 grams.

Think of the possiblities, this could drasticaly change the mass of the TL-9 
laser weapon\'s power pack for example,  or get rid of it completely by 
putting in a 100 shot "magazine" in the grip.
Example magazine
10cm x 5cm x 1cm is 50cm^3
25g   25000j@250j/sec or shot.  100shots.
(250 x 0.735/10mm diameter)^0.5 = 18.375DV
(18.375^0.43)-1= 2.5 or 3 Traveller Damage
Efficiency(which were not figured)  may drop that to 2.

I don\'t know the exact stats for the TL-9 pistol in the T4 book.  But this 
was just a rough estimate.  Lucky for me I have eveything in the office with 
me packed and ready to go to JAXCON! :)


Oh and yes, my appologies to Allen Shock and the TLWH Crew.  Mack Guyvr was 
in la-la land.  Meaning I was out of town that night, Also had to shop and 
pack for the CON.  was no where near a computer from 5pmEST to about 11pm 
EST.

I am at the office  currently, and will be leaving for JAX from there.  So

I think we should set a specific price like 500Mcr, 750Mcr or whatever others
feel is appropriate.  The current Merc Cruiser in "Starships" has a price of
285Mcr while the old CT ship was about 632Mcr.

CT has 31 troops and the current version has 40.  My preference is for 40.

Decent Grav APCs should be able to do this.  Should their cost be part of the
ship or not. Personally I don\'t think Grav APC prices should be part of the
Cruiser\'s price.  However, I think the Merc Cruiser should be able to land,
allowing it to provide a base of operations for the troops.

That seems a bit harsh. How about dividing all the skills by the number of 
jobs (rounding down)? The above character would then perform at Pilot-2/ 
Nav-1. If he also had Computer-3, and was using this as well, he\'d perform 
at Pilot-1/Nav-0/Computer-1.

        Hmmmm.... well, I usually handle J-space affairs with
not-very-detailed explanations, but one could think that the field that
creates the grid is basically a boundary which effectively cuts real space
in two, so the point is that everything inside has been cut off from the
main component of real space. But, given that one usually thinks that a
breach on the grid does not totally destroys the possibility of jump (that
would be the case if we are to be rigorous on the "separating space" stuff),
then we must assume that the field created from the grid extends "a bit"
away from the grid. So, a very small breach is covered naturally by the
field extending from the rest of the grid. A greater breach is not easily
covered, and jumpspace gets into your ship, "pushing", before the field closes.
        But, then we can think that the field extends "a bit" in all
directions, i.e. it has positive width. So, it can naturally include a
(small) percentage of the space outside the hull. This has two immediate
consequences:
        1.- The grid can be inside the hull, underneath the surface. In
fact, it is better this way because minor impacts on the hull cannot damage
the grid.
        2.- The jump field of a ship will "naturally" include relatively
small auxiliary craft in external grapples. Of course, the total
displacement matters, but, as long as it fits, one needs not to worry about
covering the auxiliary craft with supplementary grids, and so on.
        In fact, suppose one need to cover an external auxiliary craft with
a lanthanum grid (if the aux. craft is not relatively small). Then, the grid
under the craft should not be activated during the jump. Otherwise, one will
cut the space in three (external space, the ship, and the aux.craft), not in
two, and maybe the inaccuracies of a jump will result in slightly different
time travels and destination points for the two subspaces that the grid
created.. so your ship arrives now and here, but your auxiliary craft
arrived an hour earlier and ten thousand kilometers away.
        He, he, this could make a good one for novice travellers. They did
not contract an astrogator and so nobody told them to deactivate part of the
grid inside the main hull before jumping with an attached launch. And now,
the launch is missing... in fact, it appeared 12 hours ago near the
destination planet and was retrieved by an independent trader who is going
to sell it at the local starport. Imagine the PC\'s faces when they see it.
And imagine the subsequent legal(?) battle.

        Obviously, a RoM colonization ship from Japan settled a planet and,
during the Long Night, the culture experienced a tech level regression and

How about:

Personal mover (grav)

These would be compact, automated one-person transports.


\'Emissary\' escape boat - no Imperial embassy should be without one. A 
10-person, hi-G, stealthy boat for getting essential personnel off planet 
safely.

 
\'Pegasus\' Balistic Transport. A behemoth designed by McDD in the 60\'s for 
quick suborbital travel.


There\'s also my favorite from 101 Vehicles, the \'Venery\' police speeder. 
A grav unit, cockpit, and VRF Gauss Cannon. From the description of Sylea 
in M0, I\'d say these beauties would be thick as flys in the sky.

but the thing I like about T4 is that you get the full benefit of your
attributes with it.

Every point of your stat (or in the case of my system, every other
point) increases your chance of success.  In MT, there are only three
benefit points--at a stat of 5, 10, and 15.

You can only improve at +1, +2, or +3 due to your abilities.  In T4,
you get maximum benefit of every point (or every other point).

Let me ask you a question.  In MT, what is the difference between a
Dex 6 and a Dex 8.  The answer to this, realistically, is not much.
Both give you a +1 on your task throw, and so does Dex 5, 7, and 9.

Under T4, the difference is 2 whole points of benefit, and every Dex
increase increases your chance to hit.  Under my system, you still get
a better increase with each Dex level although it is only half that of
the T4 system (by design).

This is one of the things that convinced me that T4 had a superior
system to MT, and believe me, I was an ardent defender of the MT
system.

Kenneth.

For me this is the worst feature of T4. Attributes are more important 
than skills, and cost the same to aquire during character creation.
A combat based character will put the two highest stat dice in Dex 
and add +1 dex untill they reach 15, since this will increase their 
ability with all the combat skills (pistol, rifle, laser etc.). 
Likewise a more thoughtfull character will have Int/Edu of 15 and 
lots of skills  at 1\'s and 2\'s meaning they can hardly fail difficult 
(3D?) tasks.
 As other people have pointed out: skills are usually half the level of 
stats, and therefore are worth half the value, if that!

The main problem (IMHO) is that the range of stats is from 1-15. In 
other stat based games I play and run- Torg/Masterbook, James Bond, and 
Feng-Shui the actual range of stats for any characteristic is much 
smaller:
Torg 7-13 usually,
Bond 5-15 max, but usually 9-12 for agent level characters,
Feng-Shui 5-10 (except Chi) and even better, the cost of raising a 
skill with experience is the new skill+stat total.

I much prefere the skill system in Heavy-Gear by Dream Pod-9.
There skill level is the number of D6 that are rolled, use the highest 
number rolled +1 per additional 6 and then add the stat bonous(-3 to 
+3). The elegence of this system is that natural talent - +ve stat, 
always helps but higher skills mean characters fail less often, less 
chance of rolling low on all the dice.
This is the system I am going to use for T4. Also the vehicle design 
system is much more flexible and Simpler!
Note it is also designed to be both a miniture battle game and an 
RPG, oh and I ignore all the giant robots, (large powered armour 
suits).

Just what the doctor ordered, Dr. Vince...

And since this is the fifth private e-mail I\'ve gotten about this, 
I\'m going to post my reply to you on the TML.  I hope you don\'t mind.

Actually, my system is pretty simple.  I\'ll give you a run down on 
the system and let you in on some of my thinking that led to its 
creation.

Although I think that the T4 system is the best Traveller system yet,
better even than MT (which used to be my system of choice), I had two
basic problems with it.

1)  By just adding skill and attribute, the system unfairly weighted 
towards the attributes, and you run into problems like this:

	Jan has a Pilot-1 skill and a Dex-11.  Rob has a Pilot-4 skill and a 
	Dex-6.

	Since Jan\'s target number is 12 and Rob\'s target number is 10, Jan 
	should pilot the ship even though Rob is more skilled than Jan by 
	far.

2)  And my other problem lied with the task difficulty.  The chance 
of success for the high end tasks, Staggering and Impossible, was too 
high.  To explain, here\'s another example.

	Ulric has an Edu-9 and Computer-4 giving him a target number of 13.  
	On the T4 4D Impossible difficulty roll, this guy has a 44.37% 
	chance of success at the hardest task he can ever attempt.

Yes, his Computer skill is good, but what about those guys with a 5 
or even a 7 skill level?  And what about those with a stat in the 
teens?  A stat-12, skill-5 character would have a 79.48% chance at 
the Impossible under this system.

Something was obviously wrong.  The success chances were definitely 
too high.

I set about to fix the task system with these two problems in mind 
and one primary goal.  I didn\'t want to re-create the wheel.  I 
wanted a simple fix that would allow for easy conversion and still 
look like the T4 system as written in the T4 Main Book.

In other words, I didn\'t want to put a lot of time into creating a 
totally new system or converting one from a previous Traveller 
edition or another game.

Simple, playable, guided my thoughts.  Besides, that was the spirit 
of T4 anyway--a return to the simpler CT style of play.

I got a lot of help from several people here on the TML, and after 
about two weeks of work, I came up with this system.  This one is 
actually the second version that I came up with, and one TMLer called 
it KBv1.1.  The name has stuck.

So, here\'s KBv1.1.

First, to tackle the target number problem, I use this system:

	Target Number = (Stat / 2) + (Skill x 2)
	round up in all cases

This decreases the value of the stat in the calculation, but still 
gives it an important role in the target number calculation (as it 
should be).  This also increases the value of the skill level as a 
component of the target number.  The total equation also tends to 
reduce the overall target number, which helps out in reducing the 
chance of success (the second problem).

Now, let\'s fix the difficulty system.  After doing analysis on the 
chance of success of various combinations of dice, I found out two 
things.  The 1/2 die are a necessary evil (which I really tried to 
get rid of and did not like at first--now, I\'m used to them and 
accept them) because they flatten out the curve.  Without them, say 
when using a 1D, 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D, 6D system, the curve is too steep, 
and the lower target numbers are way too low to give the players any 
type of a chance with their average level-1 and level-2 skills.

The second thing I found out was that most of the difficulty 
categories in T4 were not broken.  Easy, Average, Difficult, and 
Formidable all gave good percentage chances of success at all target 
numbers.

So, I left them as is and focussed on the Staggering and Impossible 
categories.  After defining the problem like this, fixing it was 
easy.

	To fix the difficulty system, simply change the dice rolled for 
	Staggering tasks to 4D instead of 3.5D and change Impossible to 5D 
	instead of 4D.

	Staggering = 4D
	Impossible = 5D

Here\'s the percentages for any who want to check this system.  I\'ll 
give you all the categories.

In a nutshell, the KBv1.1 system is two simple changes to the T4 task 
system as written.

	1)  Use the new target number calculation (half stat, twice 
	attribute)

	2)  Change Staggering to 4D;  change Impossible to 5D



Let\'s go back and test the examples I gave you above.

The target number problem where the Pilot-4 character had a lower 
chance of success than the Pilot-1 character because the lower 
leveled character had a higher (but not a whole lot higher) stat.

	Jan:  Pilot-1, Dex-11
	Rob:  Pilot-4, Dex-6

Under KBv1.1, Jan\'s target number is 8 whereas Rob\'s target number is 
11.

	The system works, and Rob can take advantage of his much higher 
	skill.

And now the difficulty system problem for Staggering and Impossible 
tasks.

	Ulric:  Edu-9, Computer-4

	Before KBv1.1, target number was 13 and success chance at the 
	Impossible was 44.37%.

	After KBv1.1, target number is still 13, but success chance at the 
	Impossible is reduced to 15.2%.

	Again, the system works.  Objectives accomplished.

Dr. Vince, if you have any comments on this system, I would love to 
hear them--good or bad.  I always welcome comments.

Hope you find the system useful,

Kenneth.

I had the chance to ask a UAL flight crew this question.  I gave the basic
backround (the co-pilot used to game, so that helped), and asked what a
navigator/astrogator did.

The basic answer was that on large passenger planes, the navigator/co-pilot
double-checks the pilot\'s decisions, and keeps tabs on what the computer is
doing.

Then the horror stories began.  They told me that one of the main jobs of
the second man during take-off/landing is simply to look out the window.  A
747 landing in Cairo had to abort when a truck suddenly drove onto the
runway without warning.  Also, computer Nav systems occasionaly fail, and
the co-pilot once had to fly most of the way from LA to Hawaii on dead
reconning and checking stars from a blacked out cockpit!  (At least until
they were within radio range of Honolulu.)

When asked specifically about Traveller, they all agreed that they would
definantly want someone trained to double-check the numbers put out by the
ship\'s computer.  They also wanted to know where to sign up.

As someone who doesn\'t use the Traveller core rules (I use the
background) I will say that the term "impossible" says to
me that only the most superior individuals will be able
 do this at all, and even then it should be along shot.
I don\'t think any character should have more than a
10% chance at an "impossible task".

I\'ve only recently joined the list and I would like to say hello. I 
have bought every set of traveller rules published, from the

I don\'t know if this has been asked / answered before but I have a 
question regarding mustering out (MO).
T4 characters can now change career, so how does this affect MO.
1) Do they roll for each career seperately,
2) Only for the last career,
3) For all their careers but only on the last carrer tables.
This can make a major difference with the bonous\'s for ranks, e.g.
James Carter age 34
career history Terms 1&2 Army reaching O3
Term 3 Marine rank O3  (Army rank -1 + 1)
Term 4 Law Enforcement O3 (Marine-1 +1)

So does he roll
1) 4 times on army tables (2 terms + 2 for O3), 3 times on marine 
tables (1 term +2 for O3) and 3 times on the law enforcement table 
(1 term +2 for O3) for a total of 10 rolls.
2) 3 times on law enforcement (1 term + 2 for O3).
3) 6 times on the law enforcement table (6 terms + 2 for O3).
 As you can see it makes a huge difference either 3, 6 or 10 rolls.

If anyone can help me I would be very gratefull,

Remember that MT characters had a secondary stat of Int + Edu =Exp? 
This was the maximum number of skills a character could have.
I think that T4 characters have too many skills, at too high a level, 
and overall MT was better. This especially so if you consider medic-3 
to be a qualified Doctor.

The main problem IMHO is that with the importance of stats over 
skills, the designers have had to be too profligate with skills 
during character generation in order to compensate.

If you are going to assign this low a chance to someone with those 
levels of skills and stats, then why even allow it at all?

What you are saying is that a person has to have the ultimate level 
of attribute humanly possible AND have the highest level of skill 
anyone has ever heard of to even have a less than 1% chance of 
succeeding at an Impossible task.

Don\'t you think you should re-think this?

However what we
> are now calling an Impossible Task should be renamed Nearly Impossible
> and this charecter should have about a 2 or 2.5% chance of success.

So the wording is what you have a problem with?  Naturally, 
impossible usually means that there is no chance of accomplishing a 
task, but we are talking about a task system here.  If there\'s any 
chance at all of accomplishing the task, then we know that the no 
chance of success definition doesn\'t apply.

Most of us recognize that Impossible in this context means that it is 
extemely hard for a character to accomplish a feat, but it is still 
possible.  To have a decent chance of success at this, a character 
must be highly skilled and have good natural ability.

Your 2-2.5% chance of success for the god-like character you\'ve cited 
is still way too low for my tastes.  I think that Impossible tasks 
should be damn difficult to execute and have a high chance of extreme 
failure, but under your definition, most characters would never even 
have any chance.

Maybe you should create a new difficulty categorey for your game and 
call it Incredible.

I think that you are missing the point here, Peter.  My system was 
designed to be an easy fix to the already simple T4 task system.  
You\'ve recreated the wheel here, and while this might be all and good 
for your game, many of us want to stay as close as possible to the 
original T4 rules.

I make a lot of rule modifications--to add detail to areas that I 
think need it, but I rarely re-write the entire system-- except in 
the case of the xp system.  I think that this is totally broken, but 
I will still stay close to the spirit of the system designed in T4 
when I make my changes.

Reading over your system, I realize that I\'m  going to have to learn 
a whole new system if I\'m going to use it.  And, for every thing I do 
with the system, I will have to convert from the original material.

That spells, to me, a lot of unnecessary work.  I mean, why buy the 
T4 supplements?  You\'ve created your own game.  Just use the 
background material, and you\'re off.

But for me, no thank you.  I like T4.  I think it needs some tweaking 
here and there, but the basis of the system is good.

TNE ships they are built at TL15. Since the average steller tech was 
12, why are all the working starships built at a TL 3 higher than most 
of the available starports?

Likewise I think that starships should be cheaper but much more 
expensive to maintain. At present once a ship is payed off it is 
impossible not to run it at a significant profit, even a scout /

Neat :)

The rules in FF&S somewhat takes into account for the extra volume a
external craft adds to the hull. But it does not mention the hull
grid. The solution may be that the grid is thicker or more just more
of it at the external grapples, making it possible to include the
external craft, without the hassle of designing jump grid on external
crafts.

This is definitely not the case.  To compare, I didn\'t guess about 
how many skills a character gets per term in each system.  I compared 
actual characters generated with both systems.

T4 characters tended to have just a few more skill levels than ones 
created using the old 1 year method, but that\'s because T4 characters 
automatically get a skill every year and 1 year method characters 
must succeed in a roll to get a skill.

But, the characters were very comparable--especially if you used the 
brownie points allotted in the MT version of the 1 year method.

There are several ways that a GM can compensate, if he wants to, for 
the couple of level deficite in the old MT version.  One way is to 
allow a few more brownie points during character generation.  Another 
is to allow for some type of fix after the character is created--like 
count up the number of years he was in the career and compare to his 
total skill levels, then allow for some type of skill improvement.  
Or, you can make T4 characters roll for skills instead of making them 
automatic--this should make them real close.

And one thing you might do is just use them interchangable because 
they are that close.  I always found the 
deficit to be just 1-3 skill levels.  It was always less than 5.

So use the T4 college rules before the character goes into the 1 year 
method.

I always used a house rule that allowed for career changes anyway.

Oh, I agree completely with CT 4 year characters.  I may not use your 
system of beefing them up, but they definitely need improvement to 
work in the T4 universe.

But, then again, CT 4 year characters had the same problem with CT 
characters generated with the 1 year method.

And this brings me back to my original comment.  The T4 system fixes 
that old problem.  4 year characters are now compatible with 1 year 
characters.

Dex 8 is better than dex 6 because you are less likely to lose the bonus
while injured. Remember, Kenneth, that MT\'s modifiers are based upon
Current (wounded) attributes, and thatdamge points in MT convert into dice
of attribute damage. (albeit, this conversion occurs AFTER combat, thus
making combat easier to ref, imho; this is realistic due to adrenaline.)
Also, higher attributes above th break point mean less reduction in
attribute bonus from encumberance, as well.

So what? Endurance and Strength both have non-combat roles as well. See
also above.

It is one of the things I DISLIKE about T4 and TNE: 1:1 ratio of benefit
for skills and attributes. I AGREE that 5:1 is too steep, and feel 2:1 too
shallow, and so 3:1 is my house rule for MT. But see also above.

where I rolled like six pirate encounters in row, and we had to clear off
the desk for each damn combat?

Mea culpa.  Thanks for the catch.

I was fooled by agents of Tukera\'s security agency (er, and misread some
scrawled notes about the passenger table when I did the math).  My quick
analysis was not fancy; I just grabbed the medians.  So there may be more
or less demand.  The times when there is more may pay for the times when
there are less, if you have room to take them, but I didn\'t look at this
or how much the figures vary.  The table should have looked more like:

 Pop.    ---- Passengers ----    Freight
(UWP)    High  Middle  Cold     (Std)
 ----
  0       --     --     --        --
  1       --      1      1         0

  3        0      4      7       105
  4        4      4      7.5     150   The 4   is 2d-1d.
  5        4      3.5    7.5     195   The 3.5 is 3d-2d.
  6        3.5    3.5   10.5     240   
  7        3.5    7.5   10.5     285
  8        7.5    7.5   14       333
  9        7.5   10.5   17.5     378
  A       10.5   14     21       429

...which are lower than my initial estimates.

All is not lost for passenger-heavy liners.  The rules say a +DM is
given to the rolls for Carousing (Hi), Admin (Mid), and Streetwise (Low).
However, by reading the text in the MT version of this more closely, it
turns out that *any* crewmember can apply these DMs.  You might be able
to imply that the crew can sum their skill levels to increase passenger
numbers, which helps save the liner concept.  You could also rule that
larger, multiship route-based firms could maintain ticketing agencies
that are paid just to get passengers every week for their ships using
employees with Admin and Carousing, which might encourage players to
form little fledgling lines.  By encouraging them to form a route of
their choosing, then you can concentrate on developing the worlds and
people in that area, which is nice.

Of course, that probably doesn\'t help those of us who were trying to
be profitable with too many staterooms in THUDDD.  Oh well.  I did make
the assumption that at least Admin-2 would be available, and probably
Carousing-2, simply because it\'s so valuable to the merchant lines that
they\'d train people for it.  I\'m not sure if character generation does
reflect this.  (Oh, and incidentally, in MT Carousing was replaced by
Steward, so removing Steward skill seems intentional in T4.)

Since players will be using the T4 economics rules, I decided it might be
wise to make sure that they can reliably fill at least a large proportion
of the staterooms as part of being "commercially viable".  I don\'t think
this should be judged *too* harshly though, because figuring this out is
not entirely trivial, and I didn\'t have time to look too closely myself.
And clearly misfigured it when I did!  :)

While I considered the excess staterooms worth a minor deduction, there\'s
enough other nice things about the Burov that it should score quite well,
in my opinion.  For one thing, taken at face value it makes serious money, 
which is better than many ships managed!  :)  I don\'t think I\'ll go into
more detail until voting closes, though.

Thanks for the comments; you make some interesting points. One thing you
said has me puzzled though:

>> Also, there\'s that college thing. In T4, you get an ATTRIBUTE INCREASE
>> (much better than a skill with the new task system) every year PLUS a
>> skill every year you spend in school. 

> So use the T4 college rules before the character goes into the 1 year 
> method.

I\'m not sure what you mean by the one-year method here. In T4, like
Book 1, you resolve your career term by term. You get at least 4
skills or attribute increases every term. In college, you get 4 skills
and 4 attribute increases; the four attribute increases are lagniappe,
and they are a very powerful extra with the new task system. This
results in characters quite a bit more powerful than what I used to roll
up in CT with either the yearly or "termly" method.

College is really a great bonus in T4. Not only does it make T4
characters more powerful than CT characters (not a big problem as far as
I\'m concerned ---- I don\'t have player characters switching between game
systems), but it makes college-educated players quite a bit more
powerful than their school-of-hard-knocks counterparts. This upsets the
flavor of the T4 universe a bit; I anticipate more scholars relative to
veterans bopping around my campaign in the future.

Otherwise, I agree with the main thrust of your post, which was that the
4-skills-per-term method puts termly and yearly generated characters on
the same footing. It allows the T4 referee to use previous CT careers
(like Belters!) together with yearly generation systems (with rules for commando
NPC\'s, decorations, and combat ribbons) quite easily with little
modification.

But I still don\'t think that characters generated previously using a
strict by-the-rules CT system (whether yearly or termly) will (on
average) hold their own against newly generated T4 characters.
YMMV.

Because the vast majority of TNE ships were relics from when the average
WAS TL-15, built at TL-12 with some TL-15 parts \'imported\' from the
Hivers, or built in the Regency, which still was TL-15. 

Basing your costs only on power output is quite unrealistic...a TL-15
1000MW powerplant is going to be both smaller AND cheaper than a TL-12
one. This is one of the main advantages of technological advances...Our
DEC Alpha is about as powerful or more so, in computing terms, as the
early Cray \'Supercomputers\', but it\'s considerably smaller and waaaay 
cheaper.

To me, Rob is more "trained".  He is also a clutz who is going
to take a lot of work to ever make into a decent pilot.

It\'s like the situation of the middle ages person who was
never particularly talented being passed by a young talent
who is a fraction of his age.

I agree; it\'s an utter waste of life support to have a dedicated
astrogator who is busy for only a short time every 7-14 days. My
solution? I assume that astrogation skill covers both J and N-space
astrogation, and for optimal results in N-space, a ship must have an
astrogator. I further assume that "one-man" vessels like fighters or
scout/couriers have astro systems optimized for one-man operations while
larger vessels "work best" with a full crew.

Non-optimal results include poor jumps (minor temporial or spatial
errors) or badly-plotted N-space vectors (extra time taken to go places
in N-space).

That\'s how *I* play it, Brad :)

I tend to agree.  I\'d say that someone with a 17 target number should
have a realistic chance of performing an impossible task, where
someone with a target number of 9 would not.  However, a I see a 
reasonable chance as 20% to 25%, higher than that means to me
that  it is something the PC can count on working.  

I can see Kenneth\'s point, but I don\'t like the idea of lots of negative
modifiers to the target number makes a fairly clean and easy to use
task system quite clumsy.

awwww... shoot. You were right. Education in Traveller as it stands is 
Stoopid. I mean, how many people with an average edu (7), walk into 
college and came out over 150% more educated in 4 short years? What 
*were* they thinking?

I agree. So why not have a success roll for attribute advances? Maybe 
roll attribute or greater on 3d6 in order to advance?

For Example: Joe Average, edu of 7, goes to college for a term. He is 
entitled to +4 Edu. He must roll 7+ on 3D6 to get that first +1. If he 
succeeds, he needs a 8+ to get the second +1 Edu, if he succeds he needs 
9+... and so on.

Note that Joe Aboveaverage, with an attribute of 11, when rolling 3D6 has 
exactly a 50% chance to get +1 in that attribute. Joe Dumbasarock, with 
an attribute of 2, is automatically successful on that first +1.

If, like me, you feel 3d6 is still too easy, make it 2d6+d3, which adds 
up to a maximum of 15 (also the maximum attribute). Seems symetrical. 
There\'s a new use for those silly d3\'s! ;-) 

Given the structure of the T4 Task system, attribute advances *should* be 
difficult, since each increase in attribute applies to a wide variety of 
task rolls. Of course, whiners who don\'t like the weight given to 
attributes and have invented their own task system don\'t worry as much 
about attribute advances. ;-)

Hmmmm... And what\'s the task where the player uses the skill?

Perhaps a way of determining the military budget of a planetary government
could be something like this (this is just a quick system I and a friend
came up with on a dull night in Korea):  
  Take the GNP of the world:  population X average per capita annual income
(Maybe Cr 15,000 for poor worlds, Cr25,000 for average worlds, Cr40,000 for
rich worlds)
  Military budget starts at 5% of GNP, +1/2d6 (retain fractions) for High
Gov, +1/2d6 for High Law.
  I think there were guidelines published for MT to determine the costs of
maintaining starships; I don\'t have them available.

  OTOH, we could just vote on a tonnage and price range.

  This could be a sticky point - there\'s a tradeoff between combat
functionality and transport capability above a certain level.  Maybe a
troop level of 2-4 platoons (32-64 troops plus command staff)?

Within limits, of course.  It should be up to the designer to determine the
primary mission of the ship, whether it\'s for highside or dirtside actions,
and this should be reflected in the designer\'s notes.

Perhaps a way of determining the military budget of a planetary government
could be something like this (this is just a quick system I and a friend
came up with on a dull night in Korea):  
  Take the GNP of the world:  population X average per capita annual income
(Maybe Cr 15,000 for poor worlds, Cr25,000 for average worlds, Cr40,000 for
rich worlds)
  Military budget starts at 5% of GNP, +1/2d6 (retain fractions) for High
Gov, +1/2d6 for High Law.
  I think there were guidelines published for MT to determine the costs of
maintaining starships; I don\'t have them available.

  OTOH, we could just vote on a tonnage and price range.

  This could be a sticky point - there\'s a tradeoff between combat
functionality and transport capability above a certain level.  Maybe a
troop level of 2-4 platoons (32-64 troops plus command staff)?

>
>3) Be capable of ship-to-ship combat.

Within limits, of course.  It should be up to the designer to determine the
primary mission of the ship, whether it\'s for highside or dirtside actions,
and this should be reflected in the designer\'s notes.

When you care enough to send the very best.  I may have to start work on an

Didn\'t have time at the moment. Here goes

Mercenary (CT/MT)
per year skill expectation: mean roll reqired to get skill 7.55
				~58% skill chance per year.
	Assuming special duty only (incredibly rare) up to a DOZEN skills
MIGHT be acquired during a term, so expectation is 2 per term. Nowere in
advanced generation does it list any skills for promotion, and commission
grants OCS skills, not skill rolls.

High Guard (CT/MT)
Per year Skill Expectations: mean roll required: 6.9
				~72%
	Same caveats about Spl Dty and Skills for Promotion

Scouts CT/MT
Field: mean roll: 6.5; ~72%
Admin: mean roll 5.91; ~75%
	Same caveats apply.

Merchant Prince CT/MT
	mean roll req. 5.88, ~78%
	SAME CAVEATS APPLY

Sooo..
Mercs: expect 2 per term, with potential for up to a dozen
Others: expect 3 per term, with potential for a dozen
all: normal range is 1-4 per term.

Note: I found no statements granting a skill for being promoted in any of
the CT or MT Adv CGen rules. If this is correct, then Adv Gen is highly
abused, as EVERYONE I know using Adv. CGen is taking skills for promotions,
as well, which adds another 0-1 skill per term for officers, and 0-4 for
enlisted.


SINCE MT\'S skill list is about 50% longer than CT\'s, or on par with the
fully extended CT Advanced CGen, that gives similar value to skill levels.

MT\'s skill list, while detailed in different areas, is overall about the
same length as TNE\'s or T4\'s. THAT is what drives the value down. T4
actually has fewer skills overall than MT; MT breaks weapons down into
several skills: Handgun, SMG, Rifleman, Cbt Rflmn, Laser Weapons,
High-Energy Weapons, and Heavy Weapons; T4 has one, which is specialized.
Same for melee weapons.

I sat down and compared when T4 came out. Having just done a hasty recount
on MT, it has about 90 discrete skills, counting only the broadest skill
for weapons, ie: not the individual weapons, only those skills that you
actually write down.

T4 has 98 If I counted correctly, I figure I\'m within 5...

John Snead claims T4 has a much longer skill list... not so, as a quick
count shows. The MT count is, of course subject to some interp, and is +-5
skills depending upon counting method, plus 20-30 specific weapon types on
the skill list. Note that T4 is also lacking a few traditional "Traveller"
skills: Steward being the most obvious. Also, I didn\'t count the additional
skills from the alien modules in either case.

THE CAST:

Isaac Xyroli: a young, brash, and arrogant ex-Scout, currently working for
Ling Standard as pilot on the Frozen Glory, a FSY Mouffette-Rapide class
far courier.  Played by the TML\'s own Ross Coburn.

Leemcha Quo: Ascetic no-nonsense 35-year-old Asian/Vilani ex-Navy
Astrogator.  Cold, serious, no nonsense.  Played by a non-TMLer.

Dr. Ilbren Dinaskir: A Vilani archaeologist of humble origins, specializing
in the Rule-of-Man period, who rose to his present recently tenured
position due to his own brilliance and not to his humble origins on an
algae farm.  Played by TML\'er Glenn Grant.

Lt. Jack 23: A strong, silent, dangerous type with "military" written all
over him; formerly a marine, now working for Ling Standard Security.  Has
manged to overcome his underprivileged youth as an orphan in a Solomani
Genetic Collective rather nicely.  Again, played by nobody you know.

Lt. Kyle Deschenko: A nice, genteel thug from one of the best of families.
Despite coming from a well-off family (SOC A), he nevertheless managed to
get sent to a military academy for his youthful misdeeds.  After a stint in
the Navy, he spent some time as a Rogue before getting hired by Ling.  Has
every weapon-related skill save Heavy Weapons.  Likewise, played by a
non-TMLer.


Episode 4: Dante Was Right... It Is Cold Down Here (subtitle; Rats of
Outlandish Size)


Scene 1:

        The game picked up right where we left off, with the crew of the
=46rozen Glory receiving a distress signal from the Messalina (a FSY
Caligula-class megayacht carrying dame Sisao hault Joostens who had booted
them off their archaeological site and declared the system a Red Zone last
week).  After discussion, the crew of the Frozen Glory decide to loiter on
back to Skrunge to see what\'s up, visions of salvage dancing in their
heads.  After arriving on Skrunge 2.5 days later they probe the site via
the orbiting survey sats (as Xyroli had taken the anti-hijack offline in a
fit of pique after it had gassed him back on Archipelago, the virus did not
infect it; especially after Lt. Duschenko, its creator, was on the lookout
for it).  Radar and neutrino scans (heavy snowstorms over the site blocking
visual and infrared wavelengths) reveal that the Messalina had several
locks and its cargo bay doors open and only one of its reactors was
running, and that the doors into the side of the mesa were now partially
open.

        Two days later, after the sunset terminator storm had moved on and
the weather was a little bit better, they did a high-altitude pass,
revealing that the Messalina was mostly buried under drifting snow; it was
giving off next to no infrared signal.  There were of course significant
heat sources down in all four silos, and a lesser one radiating from behind
one of the mesa doors.

        After much discussion, centered around the wisdom of landing while
whatever it was that trashed the Messaline was still hanging around, they
decided not to land and investigate until morning.  In the meantime,
however, they decided to deal with Lt. 23, whose loyalty to Ling was such
that Xyroli had had him pinned down in his cabin at 3 Gs for the past week
so that he couldn\'t interfere with their nefarious plans.  However, Lt. 23,
an husky, ingenious sort, had rigged up a booby trap; a gauss smg set up as
a set gun duct-taped to the underside of the chair, rigged to fire when his
door was open.   Lt. Duschenko set it off when entering the cabin.  Sadly,
I rolled really badly and all it did was damage the panelling, and Xyroli,
watching the proceedings via security cam, quickly cranked the grav back up
to three G\'s when Lt. 23 pulled another gun on Dr. Dinaskir in an attempt
to take him hostage.  Lt. 23, weakened by Vilani food poisoning and several
days at high G\'s without food or water, quickly succumbed.  They shot him
full of Fast Drug and left him there.

        After waiting for a few more days while the long Skrungian night
came to an end and the morning storms had moved past the site, they land.
The landing site was a hummocky, frost-heaven, swampy mess, dotted here and
there with the carapaces of what appeared to be hibernating SLST-3\'s
(Skrungian Large Spiky Thing 3; a 400-kg herbivore rather like a wiwaxia
writ large; a very big, spiky-shelled, low to the ground critter); the
Messalina is desolated, mudspattered, with its ports open.  Taking great
precautions to avoid alien infestations, they load up with guns and put the
4 security troops into the air raft, with Dr. Dinaskir driving and Leemcha
and Lt. Duschenko riding shotgun.  They proceed to head to the Messalina,
intending to enter via the cargo-bay doors.  However, as they\'re coming in
for the doors, they hear a shouted warning over their comms and the loud
crack of a FSA 6.66mm gauss big game rifle; one of the SLST-3 carapaces
takes a rifle hit, and starts thrashing around like there is something in
death throes inside.  Suddenly, a half-dozen carapaces are overturned, and
alien critters emerge from beneath them, pelting the air raft with spears
(hitting both Leemcha and one of the security guards, rendering them
unconscious).

        The critters in question were quadrupedal, 2m tall and 4m long when
their long pink hairless tails were taken into account, with pointed
muzzles, whiskers, round ears, two red eyes and white fur; hardly the
Skrungian taxonomical norm.  Shortly thereafter, rifle fire from inside the
mesa, coupled with rifle and smg fire from the air raft, revealed the fact
that they bled red...(?!)  Xyroli, not to be outdone, began warming up the
=46rozen Glory\'s laser and added its fire to the carnage.  The critters were
quickly routed.  Dr Dinaskir. maintaining altitude, headed for the mesa;
Lt. Duschenko and the surviving security troops hosing down the SLST-3
carapaces that were clustered suspiciously close to the doors;
unsurprisingly, these too proved to be concealing critters who died rather
messily as their primitve technology proved no match for TL-12 weaponry.

        Inside the doors were Baron Hordred hault Hereish, Dr. Mintuush (an
archaeologist colleague of Dr. Dinaskir\'s), and a few of the Messalina\'s
crew, including what appeared to be a rather frightened 16-year-old girl.
Quickly loading the elderly Dr. Mintuush, the girl, and the non-combatant
survivors on board, and leaving Lt. Duschenko behind to provide covering
fire, they return to the Frozen Glory.  Xyroli, meanwhile, has begun to
systematically commit genocide on the large numbers of critters emerging
from the silos, using the ship\'s laser.  Some, however, manage to flee.
Back at the ship, they unload the wounded.  Dr. Mintuush, who had
medical-3, begins to tend to them.

        While the survivors are being shuttled back to the ship, Xyroli
calls up Baron Hordred and begins to negotiate.  Baron Hordred, wisely
concluding that he\'s dealing with criminal scum of the worst sort, agrees
to give up his group\'s weapons in exchange for passage off this godforsaken
ball of rock.  Xyroli, when told that dame Sisao is dead, replies with
"good".  Lt. Duschenko collects their weapons and Dr. Dinaskir ferries them
back to the ship.

        Once on board, the Baron and the 16-year-old, who claims to be
"Jenny, one of the stewards" and who is showing signs of being highly
traumatized, are escorted up to the lounge.  To make a long story short
(and in passing I was really, really, really generous to Ross on this one.
Had I not been such a soft touch his character would have been dead dead
dead.  Indeed, I greatly regret it :>), she puts three bullets from a
magnum revolver into Xyroli.  In truth, she is actually dame Sisao and is
rather highly pissed off at his cavalier attitude towards his impending
demise, as well as suspecting him of involvement in the problems the
Messalina recently experienced.  Having succeeded a Staggering surprise
roll, he manages to shoot her husband (Baron Hordred) with his body pistol,
injuring him slightly.  She then announces over the ship\'s intercom that
she is indeed she, that the traitorous criminal miscreant Xyroli has been
summarily executed for lese-nobilit=E9, and that the crew of the Frozen Glor=
y
is hereforth pardoned for their misdemeanours and that upon her return to
civilization will commend them to the Emperor, as well as grant them
salvage rights to the wreck of the Messalina.

        Not surprisingly, this goes a long way towards mollifying opinion,
especially as dame Sisao gives Duschenko her recorded word as a Lady of the
Third Imperium that she will honour her promises towards the crew.
However, Duschenko points out that as their only other pilot is Leemcha,
and she\'s wounded, it might make sense to patch Xyroli up.  While Dr.
Mintuush tends to him, he assists Baron von Hordred to a bunk, and gives
him a dose of Fast drug.  Then he heads down to the lounge, informs dame
Sisao that her husband wanted a word with her.  Scooting up to the cockpit,
he then proceeded to turn the gravity up to 3Gs all over the ship, all the
while maintaining a pretense via the intercom that some wierd malfunction
was causing the problem.

        Readily succeeding on an Impossible Int+computer roll, he then
managed to break Xyroli\'s password protection on the anti-hijack system
files, reinstall the anti-hijack program, and activate it, setting it on
lethal; it handily slaughtered all non-crew-members on board; dame Sisao &
her husband, Dr. Mintuush, and the other survivors of the Messalina.

        Immediately prior to to Lt. Duschenko\'s act of senseless mass
murder, Dr. Mintuush had been explaining to Dr. Dinaskir that although the
ROM site was sadly totally empty, the critters that had boarded the
Messalina (and eaten most of its crew, although the players never found
this out) bore too much of a resemblance to common Terran lab rats for it
to be just coincidence; rightly guessing that they were geneered lab rats
uplifted for military use, he proposed that he and Dr. Dinaskir collect
some tissue samples from the numerous dead specimens littering the landing
area, and do a joint paper on them.  Then the gravity tripled and the
antihijack system kicked in and killed him before Dr. Dinaskir\'s horrified
eyes.

        Given that they\'d just blown my plans for the next part of the
campaign right out of the water (patrons like that you don\'t meet every
day, but nooooo... instread of being grateful they kill them, arglebarg), I
was rather taken aback; Lt. Duschenko\'s actions were only explicable if he
were a homicidal psychopath...  However, their attempts to salvage the
Messalina succeeded, despite my throwing a series of Impossible engineering
rolls and Staggering piloting rolls at them, and some time later they
managed to get the yacht jury-rigged with new control panels (female
critters back on Skrunge were wearing most of the old ones as jewellery)
cannibalized from the Frozen Glory and refuelled. ready to go who knows
where.   I called a stop to proceedings at that point; we\'ll pick up in a
few weeks after I\'ve picked up M0, and see what we can\'t salvage from this
mess... clearly, going back to the Imperium is impossible for Duschenko and
Xyroli.  Maybe we\'ll generate new characters.  Who knows...  anyhow, here
are what the critters were:
