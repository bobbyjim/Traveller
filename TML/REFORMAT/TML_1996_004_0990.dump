I had been taking that as a given. Is this not the case? HEPlaR is
good as a backup M-drive, for deep space operations, and even as a
last-ditch weapon. I wouldn\'t design a warship without one.

I don\'t think it need be nearly a large as the ships it\'s constructing, 
perhaps 1/4 to 1/3 of the total constructed displacement tonnage.  All it 
needs are clip on cargo holds for raw materials that can be rapidly 
removed and replaced once depleated.  The central structure would house 
personel and the radial arms would be where the construction took place. 
 I\'d imagine the arms would have robotic, Canadarms on them for major 
external construction, Spine laying and hull finishing, and much of the 
fine interior work would be done by hand, electronics & powerplant.  

You\'d need a crew of at least one per fifty displacement tons of 
construction and one robot (High Imperial tech levels not Post virus of 
course) per 5 or 10 tons of construction.

THis is all pretty rough guesstimates of course.

Agreed; however, even Tom Clancy\'s "worst" (which this isn\'t) is 
far better than most best-selling novelists\' "best".  My goal 
as a wannabe-writer is to write that well someday... 
 
The main problems I had with EO were (1) its length (840+ pages!) 
and (2) point-of-view characters shifting too often and too quickly. 
Other than that, the story is great!  (Although you all knew that 
Inspector O\'Day was going to be where he was when he was, didn\'t you? 
Clancy kinda telegraphed that one.)

We\'re in disagreement here: I think "Cardinal" was one of his 
best... _Patriot Games_ (of which I have an autographed copy), 
is generally held to be Clancy\'s "weakest".

First of all, not only is history rewritten by the victors, but it is 
also rewritten by each generation that follows it...

Late 20th century culture, by its very definition, has a very 
negative picture of feudalism and monarchy...  Understandable, but 
remember our view of the past (or the proposed Traveller future) is 
as biased as their view would be of themselves...

Hell, I live in America...  Americans consider themselves morally 
superior to just about everybody.  Never mind that they spent 100 
years screwing the Indians out of their homes, land, women, lives, 
way of life, culture.  They also forget about My Lai, Teapot Dome, 
Watergate, the 200 year long struggle over slavery and civil rights 
which continues to this day, etc...

EVERY culture, no matter how high-minded, has its share of rogues, 
and dirty little secrets...

I have long proposed that the US, for example is an oligarchy.  Think 
about it.  Only about 25% of the people vote in Presidential 
elections...less in other elections.  Yes, the leadership is 
popularly elected (although w/ only 25% of the vote this is also 
questionable), but think who funds their campaigns...the Kennedys, 
the Vanderbilts, the Forbes\', the Gates\', etc...

Yes, the politicians change, but their financial backers don\'t...and 
in the long run, who finances somebody\'s campaign means at least as 
much as what the candidate proclaims himself in favor of...

These views, of course, don\'t make me very popular with patriots...

Granted, but remember, such a noble in the early Imperium is probably 
going to be painted in a positive light by his people...  "Why yes, 
the Duke did kill that guy on 61 Cygni but look at the trade figures..."

> I think we\'re in agreement:  Nobles\' violent and thieving tendencies

Let\'s extend that...  people in general have violent and thieving 
tendencies which are best focused outward...  Every human enterprise 
and government has eventually collapsed from internal decay...undoubtedly, 
this will someday be the ultimate fate of the western democracies as well...

I just don\'t like the idea of portraying every noble as a thief...  
Do that, and you\'re going to have a group of characters who have a 
great desire to push every noble they come into contact with out 
of the nearest airlock sans vacc suit ASAP.  I thought it dangerous 
to buy into this generality, and still do...

Perhaps the discussion about Tom Clancy\'s new book is more relevant 
to the TML than I thought ;-)... _Executive Orders_ has a lot of 
wonderful stuff about the *responsibilities* of both the guy in 
charge and the citizens who chose who is to run things for them. 
Pick good people who are going to pick good people to work under 
them.  "Noblesse oblige" is a fancy way to say "you are here to 
serve your citizens, not the other way around".   
 
If Cleon is assumed to be a good man and a responsible ruler,  
he will have picked good people to do the job of government. 
Thus, the assumption that Year 0 saw more of the "noblesse oblige" 
in action than later years.  If you pick good people, the 
"felon who steals the common out from under the goose" is going 
to be the exception to the rule, not the rule.

Again, if you are responsible enough to pick good people for the 
job, the "bad apples" will be a small and despised fraction of 
the total.  Face it--you have a government to run, are you going 
to pick known brigands for the job?   
 
The other obvious check on rapacious nobles: all government exists, 
in the long run, at the consent of the governed.  Push "the  
governed" too far, and they will throw your ass out of office--if 
you have a democracy.  If you don\'t, they\'ll stand you up in front 
of a firing squad "come the revolution"...

        I qualified my statement as opinion because I didn\'t want to start
rumors. I am very glad to hear that this will be the case. There is,
however, one thing missing which I noticed. There are no notes on how to
design drop tanks! or even what they are! I had to use FF&S (oh no) for that
:) which was OK, but if I were
a newbie, I wouldn\'t have known that was an option.

Now that does really interesting things to the whole theory of
battleriders.  It also makes a nice little niche for a design I\'ve been
working on.  A pseudo BR with jump-1 (or maybe 2) capability coupled
with a J-3 or better tender.  Jump the tender with riders in-system and
offload riders carrying fuel for a short jump, then put the tender in
reserve at a pre-designated location 1 jump away, maybe meeting a tanker
there.  Don\'t have to worry about protecting your weak ships and get
most of the combat effectiveness density of a BR while allowing an
escape jump.  It also eliminates absolute dependance of the BRs on the
tender, allowing independant action as normal starships in a lot of
places.  Finally, it gives the BR fuel to use for HEPlaR if the
situation calls for it.

Pleas let me know if there are any canonical problems with this concept
of which I may not be aware.  I was working on this with High Guard when
the T4 news came out.  One of these months I\'ll get enough breathing
room to aim SSDS at it.  (I never got into TNE, so I don\'t have FF&S.

   I bought the the original three black books about 1982.  Thank you once
again for your compliments.  There were times when I began to wonder if I
could do it myself, but the material in TTC #10 is only the beginning.

   Had I not fudged the rolls for Terra and Dingir, they would have been
sliced and diced as well (come to think of it, when I did natural rolls for
Terra, it came out with a tech level of 9--not too bad, but not high enough
for my purposes).


>Remember that the designers themselves admitted \'fudging\' the

   True enough, the Solomani Rim was generated "by hand", unlike many of the
other sectors churned out by GDW and other sources over the years.  My
philosophy on that is that sectors are like fine cuisine--though there may be
recipies for what you are doing, it\'s not something you produce on an
assembly line basis.

   The collapse of the Solomani Rim was also done "by hand".  At no time did
I rely on the aid of a computer program in carrying it out (I guess that
makes me the biggest mass murderer of all time, when you consider how
populated the Solomani Rim was, but fortunately my victims were made of paper
and ink, not flesh and blood).  Hopefully you see this in the way that the
subsectors were detailed--each one of them has a story to tell that is at
least slightly different than all the others.  That was the feel of the
original John Harshman work, and I hope I have to an extent recreated it.

   True.  People have a similar problem imagining the Holocaust.  It takes
stories like "The Diary of Anne Frank" or "Schindler\'s List" to bring the
point home.  Unfortunately, a role-playing game is a poor platform from which
to tell such stories.

   Once you\'ve read the article on the Vegans, hopefully the game reason as
to "why" will make more sense.

   See above.

   Here you are preaching to the choir.  There are just too many horror
stories out there to make giving your number out over the Internet even an
option (IMHO).  My understanding is that they are working on technologies to
make such transactions more secure, and some businesses have already have
them in place.

   Just as history shows us examples of battles that were won that should
have been lost, people who should have died but instead lived to do heroic
things,  nations that despite the odds against them that became great, so too
have there been battles that could have been won but weren\'t, people who died
before before their time, and nations that have been trampled under the feet
of invaders--nations that should have continued on for another millenia.
 Such is fate.

   It should be apparent from the material presented so far that the Vegans
on Muan Gwi have established a tech level base of 11 (about where it was at
the end of the Long Night).  What\'s not apparent is why the Vegans on Muan
Gwi haven\'t spread that technology around to other Vegan worlds.

   You perhaps are on to something here....as for doing something with
knowledge, doing anything mechanically or technically oriented takes one part
knowledge, one part tools.  The former can be learned while the latter must
be acquired or invented.  Who is more likely to get off a desert island?  A
guy who knows how to build yachts, but has no lumber or carpenter\'s tools, or
an accountant who doesn\'t know a spar from a poop deck but has plenty of
these things?  My money is on the accountant.

I have, indeed, tried Escape Velocity. It is *awesome*. I recommend it 
especially to Traveller fans, as it contains many inescapable parallels 
to the traveller game.

I have the URL:

http://www.ambrosiasw.com/Ambrosia_Products/EV.html

There is also an unofficial fan webside with add-ons and such:

http://www.globalnet.ca/ev

I had started a plug-in to put the Regina subsector into the game, but I 
haven\'t yet gotten around to figuring out how to delete *everything* 
instead of just tacking it on. The problem just requires time, something 
I need more of...

BTW, I have several Hypercard stacks I made a few years back, including 
Character Generation (MT), Traveller Atlas, Trade Generation, and World 
Generation modules. Personally, I think they\'re quite spiffy. As soon as 
those bums at IG get around to sending me the hardcover I\'ll update them 
for T4. In the meantime, I\'ll post them to Dave Golden\'s website, or 
Goran\'s if anyone is interested...

Before this little war between the various services gets out of hand (as
this type of nonsense typically does, although I must confess that it is
pretty funny), I would like to make the point to all referees that this type
of "we\'re the best and you aren\'t" mentality would probably pervade tha
various Imperial Army and Marine units in the CT/MT/TNE universes, and could
probably be put to good use as background info for characters, or as a
sideline for a campaign.  
        I would love to make more comments vis-a-vis Mr. Berry\'s comments to
my comments, etc., but this is not the forum, even though he has some good
information (but not explained fully).  However, it does bring to mind a
quote from a former college professor- "why let the facts get in the way of
a good story?"

It\'d mask some of the IR signature, by being *cold* and between the
ship and the sensor. Beyond that I don\'t see much effect, as the
"white" appearance requires that there by light to scatter. It may be
rather dark out there. :-)

Dig back and check out my post on what groundside berths would be like.
Definitely not practical to evacuate them. Besides, since they are
designed to direct any explosions *up* and way from the rest of the
facility, they only have the fire fighting gear for two reasons:

1. The ship-owners and insurance companies insist.
2. They can charge for it. :-)

You only just noticed? :-)

Heck, you want *really* devious? Have the players open a cargo
container that has had its markings scorched off. When they open it, it
is full of liquid (or solid blocks) that have a *very* pronounced
blue-white *glow* in the dim lighting.

Bet you a cookie that the players either grab for the nearest radiation
sensor, or slam the lid closed and run like hell.

I can\'t figure out *why* a shipment of special high-tech luminescent
paint (the liquid) or plastic (the solid blocks) panics people so. :-)

(haven\'t tried that one, but I got similar results in a D&D game when
the players noted that the walls of the room were glowing. In that case
it was bioluminescense)

	Probably not.  Million-ton ships are not really that much more 
economical than 20,000Td ships for shipping cargo.  I\'ve done some work 
on this which I\'ll post when I can.

<econ lecture mode ON>
	Economists talk about two motivations for trade: comparative 
advantage and competitive advantage.  Comparative covers trade between 
an ag world and a mining world, for instance.  Competitive is most 
important between two countries of similar comparative advantage, like 
the U.S. and Japan.  Flat-panel displays and CPUs are both hi-tech goods 
requiring a lot of physical and human capital, but the Japanese dominate 
one area and the U.S. the other because of the large investments required 
in each which the other hasn\'t effectively duplicated.
	What this means for Trav is that two TL-12 industrial worlds 
still have reason to trade.  It is likely that they may even trade goods 
that both worlds have strong industries in.  Americans buy European cars 
and Europeans buy American cars.  
	As for your trade categories, they basically make sense in game 
terms.  Luxury goods are probably about evenly divided between trade 
motivated by  comparative vs competitive advantage.  Buying and selling 
Andromedan rubies is probably different than buying and selling 
Andromedan pig iron, though, so it makes sense to separate luxury goods 
as a separate category for game purposes.
	An important note is that even if the worlds of the Sylean 
Federation are capable of being completely self-sufficient and are 
totally technologically superior to their neighbors they _still_ have a 
reason to trade!  The gains from trade are such that even if one world is 
in absolute terms able to produce all goods more cheaply than another, if 
their comparative advantages are different, they still gain from trade.  
How?  Well, imagine a TL-9 ag world and a TL-12 mining world.  The 
hi-tech mining world can grow food hydroponically cheaper than the Tl-9 
ag world can grow it and ship it to the mining world (for purposes of 
argument), but the mining world still gains from buying their food from 
the ag world because it can shift resources from relatively more 
expensive ag to relatively less expensive mining and the ag world can 
make a similar shift from mining to ag.  Both worlds eliminate their more 
expenisve products and can focus on what they can do best, leaving a 
larger surplus for all concerned.
<econ lecture mode off>

	What this means for Trav is that the nascent Imperium has very 
large gains to be had from trading with its low-tech neighbors.  I can 
see a TL-10 world producing large fusion reactors in exchange for 
miniturized fusion reactors from a TL-12 world.  Even more extreme, a 
TL-12 company could shift production of things like consumer goods to 
TL-8 or lower worlds to take advantage of inexpensive labor and material 
inputs.  The worlds of the Sylean Federation may have survived the Long 
Night because of their self-sufficiency, but remaining so will leave them 
economically stagnant.

	If shipping is a competitive business then it won\'t really matter 
to the shipper since he\'ll just be paid per cargo container.

	Since trade will be growing rapidly there probably won\'t be enough
ships to go around at first.  This means people who own ships, shipyards,
and starports, will be capturing lots of the gains from trade, ie.
charging a lot.  
	That doesn\'t necessarily mean PC ships, because the megacorps will
be able to excercise large economies of scale in shipping between the core
worlds.  Jeff is right that Free Traders will be the ones blazing the
trade routes that are later fully exploited by the \'Corps.  Still, there
will be lots of money to be made for those daring enough to blaze those
trails and wise enough to know when its time to move on before they get
squashed by the big boys.
	Goods will be priced according to the type of world, TL, and the 
availability of shipping.  Where there\'s lots of shipping, prices will be 
the same (minus shipping cost) between worlds.  Where there\'s less 
shipping, this equilibration is not possible.  That means that 
established trade routes, with lots of big ships, will have a smaller 
profit margin than new routes where the gains from trade have not been 
exhausted and shipping is in short supply.
	In CT, I remember being delighted when my ref rolled an 
industrial world, an ag world, and a mining world all near each other.  
It was a perfect trading triangle and we made tons of money.  Even at the 
time it didn\'t make sense to me because I figured if we were doing it, 
why wasn\'t everyone else and driving the prices down?  Any new trade 
system should find a way to fix this problem.
	I could talk about this for a long time,about this, but I\'ll wait 
for comments before I run off at the fingers even more :-)

  Right now, we have a review of Traveller, and promises of two
  NPC writeups.  We can use any and/or all of the following:

        Adventures/Campaigns/Scenarios
        NPC writeups
        Location writeups (a la the RICE Papers)
        Equipment writeups
        Spacecraft and Starship writeups
        Alien Minor Race writeups
        Player and GM Aids for the computer (include source code)
        Fiction set in the Traveller universe (any Era)
        Writeups and Novelizations of Past or Current
                Adventures and Campaigns
        Rule Modifications and Extensions

  Op-Ed and Letters will also be appropriate, when there\'s some
  stuff to write letters about, or to opine about.

  Any of the above may also include artwork (GIF and JPEG format
  only), or Travelleresque artwork, with captions, can be
  submitted alone.

Which is why I\'m a fan of "skinsuits". Sure, they are a pain to fit,
and hell to get in/out of. But that\'s why you wear them *as* your
"underwear". You only need to get into/out of them once a day. Probably
in the (pressure tight!) shower compartment.

Yeah. Just picture the guy inside a panic locker as it slowly dawns on
him that whatever happened appears to have killed or incapacitated the
rest of the crew... That\'d be about as much fun as sitting on the
bottom in a disabled sub and *hoping* that a DSRV will show up before
the air runs out. :-(

Yep. The sci.space FAQ gives some references. There were a lot of
experiments with chimps, and a couple of accidental exposures of humans
to fairly hard vacuum (accidents in the *big* vacuum chambers at places
like Wright-Patterson).

I\'m in agreement here, too. Clancy tells a story far, far better than most of the 
alleged a-list novelists. I wouldn\'t give you three cents for Danielle Steel\'s latest 
drool.

Frankly, I _like_ good, long novels. I really don\'t care how long a Clancy novel gets, 
because the man is simply incapable of writing dull (to quote S. Robinson on Robert 
Heinlein). As for the dizzying PoV shifts -- The "three-ring-circus" is characteristic 
of techno-fiction, and the complexity of Clancy\'s plots demand split-second timing and 
rapid PoV changes. Recall how the rapid changes built exctiment in _TSoaF_ .

TC _often_ telegraphs his moves. . . and I don\'t really care, as they feed fan 
speculation until The Next One is out.

Weakest of all or the weakest of the Jack Ryan books? I think _Red Storm Rising_ is the 
weakest fiction he\'s written (but, keep in mind that a bad TC beats the divine snot out 
of the best of the rest).

**Sigh** Those little lectures were my favorite parts of _EO_. The timing of the novel\'s 
release is suspicious, given the US Election calender.

I\'m running a game of TNE on a BBS set in an alternate 1116 where Stephron\'s daughter 
was not assassinated, but was wounded, by Dulinor, and escaped toward the Marches on an 
Imperiallines courier. When the PCs met her, they proceeded to treat her like some kind 
of china-doll stuffed with nerve-gas: beautiful, fragile, and deadly if not handled 
carefully. Much to their surprise, Crown Princess Isolande (renamed her, too) is a very 
real human being who is well-aware of the meaning of _noblesse oblige_ and the depths to 
which the Imperium has sunk because of the scum elements of the nobility. Isolande is 
constantly showing my PCs _by example_ that she works for them and she is honor-bound to 
work harder, work longer, and bear her share of dangers.

Of course I liked _WR_ I didn\'t mention it because it wasn\'t, in the strict sense, a 
Jack Ryan novel . . .

Now what an idea for a merc contract: destabilize a major government. Mebee we can crash

Dead wrong, Darryl. Dead, bloody wrong.

If by "about," you mean "the objective in" warfare, then warfare is about denying the 
enemy the ability to wage war, not about siezing objectives. If by siezing an abjective, 
you deny the enemy the ability to wage war, than you have a case. 

However, I might point out that it is possible to limit the enemy\'s ability to wage war 
without "taking objectives." Logistics is a case in point. Deny the enemy supplies, and 
you take away his ability to hurt you. Attack his _will_ to hurt you, and he will stop 
making war. Case in point: Viet Nam. The US had the firepower to rule the battlefields 
and "take objectives," but the North Vietnamese adopted a strategy that attacked 
America\'s will to continue (and the government of the time made it too easy for the 
North to do so).

Fire-shock tactics 101. 
Heavy cavalry\'s days as shock troops were numbered in the 13th Century. References:

Not only that, but WWI artillery rounds were _fragmentation_ rounds.

Infantry doctrine had not evolved fast enough to keep up with technology. In 1918, the 
Germans used a then-revolutionary infantry doctrine -- rapid advances in open formations 
to bypass stiff resistance and overcome other resistance to penetrate deep into the 
enemy\'s rear and ultimately deny him the means to wage war. These tactics were an early 
foot-bound version of the much-feared _Blitzkrieg_.

The tank was the other, mechanistic, answer to the machine gun.

Okay, fewer individuals can do the same damage. The line between artillery, infantry and 
cavalry is blurred, thanks to Technology. I can buy this. 

However, does technological advance change the entire thrust of warfare as we know it? 

NO!!!

Firepower is firepower. Cavalry, weather it is a guy on a nag, a guy in a helicopter or 
some kind of futuristic super-trooper who can level cities with an eyeblink and a long 
grunt IS STILL CAVALRY. Infantry, weather they are armed with sticks, swords, spears, 
muskets, M-16s or PGMPs are _still_ infantry. Artillery -- torsion-powered, CPR, energy, 
whatever -- IS STILL ARTILLERY!

Yes, tactical realities must adapt to technology, but the eternal imperatives of warfare 
are still the same and will remain the same.

The disparity of which you speak _was_ addressed in _Striker_ and _Striker II_. Low-tech 
armies get ground into sausage against high-tech armies in combat. The challenge for the 
low-tech guys is to find a way to win -- to deny the enemy the means to wage war -- that 
does not involve human-wave assaults, etc.

Sounds about right: my eyes are 5\'3" off the ground.


>Remember, the "size" of a minature is supposed to be the height of an

Actually, the size of the miniature is supposed to be the measure from eyes
to ground.  This is because many/most historical miniatures (which started
the business) have hats.  After all, your average Grenadier Guard is a lot
taller than 6\' when he\'s wearing his busby (that tall black fur hat).  

You\'re right, most manufacturers aren\'t too careful about scale, especially
with their RPG lines.  (Rafm\'s Cthulu figures, for example, are huge compared
to their historical figures, and they\'re done by the same sculptor.  They
look OK next to Ral Partha Shadowrun figures.) I\'ve got used to it, and after
all people vary in height, but I wish manufacturers were more consistent.

And you can say exactly the same thing about capitalists.  Look at all the
chaps who coughed out their lungs or mangled themselves in machinery; look at
the children working 14 hour days six days a week in the mills; look at...

Come to that, ask someone in a modern slum how free they are.  

One of the good things about having an individual noble is you have someone
responsible.  A capitalist can hide behind the corporation.


Look at how Niven and Pournelle treat nobles in the Mote books.  In the
first, they have a tradition/expectation of service.  By the second, this is
beginning to fade.

As a long standing miniature ARMY collector (Modern, Renaissance and

     Military academies don\'t produce many good officers; it\'s the 
     *battalions* (specifically platoon sergeants) that make good officers 
     out of the *very ordinary* raw materials produced by the military 
academies. I suggest that enlisted soldiers/marines/spacers get the chance to 
enter military/naval academy, with bonuses on their success roll for INT, terms 
of service and combat experience. *Real* soldiers don\'t have too many problems 
with officer training, except for some of the classroom stuff! 
     
     You might also want to consider using the British Commonwealth system of 
     military ranks for armies on some worlds, just to give a different 
     flavour. Officer ranks are pretty much as in the US Army, but enlisted 
     ranks (ORs) are a bit different, particularly at the higher NCO ranks: 
     
     (for infantry units) 
     Private  (PTE)
     Lance-corporal (LCPL)  Section 2IC
     Corporal   (CPL)       Section Commander; same as sergeant in US Army
     Sergeant   (SGT)       Platoon sergeant
     (Staff Sergeant) Senior NCO not in chain of command eg clerk, stores
     Warrant Officer Class 2  Company Sergeant Major (CSM)
     Warrant Officer Class 1  Regimental Sergeant Major (RSM); aka \'God\' :)
     
     In the Commonwealth system you would *never* see a Sergeant leading a 
     section (squad for you yanks), but you often see LCPLs filling in for CPLs 
and privates for LCPLs. Promotion commonly occurs from SGT to WO2 (Staff Sgt is 
often a specialist rank).

A picture just came into my mind: what if /everyone\'s/ eyes were 5\'3" off

I\'m sort of the resident heretic on this. I *really* don\'t see that
interstellar *commodity* trading is going to be all that common. By the
time you have fusion power, you no longer *need* "ores". So what if
gadolinium is found at only one part per million in ordinary rock? That
means that if you feed a million tons of rock (about a 64 meter cube)
into fusion torch extraction unit, you\'ll get a ton of it. And you\'ll
get similar amounts of the other "rare" elements. Plus lots and lots of
oxygen, silicon, titanium, aluminum, etc. 

This has all sorts of consequences. Most don\'t break canon. The only
real "break" is the lack of a commodities trade in raw materials. And
given the fact that all the trade systems so far are broken to one
degree or another, I don\'\'t think it\'s that big a deal.

But among other things, this means that one of the *cheapest* materials
is quartz glass (silicon dioxide). It\'d be the primary output of of an
extractor (actually, it\'d be silicon and oxygen in plasma states, but
it\'s easy to combine them). Aluminum is the cheapest metal, with
titanium not that much more expensive. Iron is less abundant, so it\'ll
cost nore. But it\'ll still be cheap.

Excuse me. A comet is a body *kilometers* across. Any fleet that can\'t
be refueled by several cubic kilometers of ice is *damned* big.

One displacement ton is 14 m^3. One cubic kilometer is 1e9 m^3. That\'s
over 70 *million* displacement tons. And water ice has a lot more
hydrogen per unit volume than LH2. A cubic meter of water or ice has a
mass of roughly 1 tonne. 1/9th of that is hydrogen. So, one cubic
kilometer of ice is 1e9/9 tons of hydrogen. Or 111 million tons of
Hydrogen. 

How big is your fleet? :-)

And as I said figure 10 km as "average" size for an icy body out there.
Then consider that larger bodies are easier to detect.

	IMHO 600-3000 dt ships will fit best. You\'ll probately

	I think that these are two differnt kind of shoes. Shippping
	cargo containers for a per displacement+handling price would
	be fixed inside an economie. But there is always a method to
	make money for a free trader.

	Here is my free trader example from 15 years ago.

	While there is a lot of trade in the north see (mainly 999-3000
	tons) it was posible to start with 1000 DM and a sailboat and
	end up with 18 TDM after 6 weeks of holiday spend in ireland
	sweeden and netherlands. Of couse it was illegal to sell
	whiskey in sweeden and weed in ireland, but it made the most
	profit.

	I also think that we need to make a difference between shipping
	cargo, and buying/selling/speculating. A Jayhawk Trader is designed
	to become bankrott, if it only jumps the main routes and shipping
	cargo. A Jahawk needs a very good Marketing specialist to buy & sell

Your comments are quite correct, but that last one is the most important 
aspect of the whole argument: the picture is reminiscent of Klingons.  
Since Marc has expressed a desire to make Traveller the third big-time 
sci-fi franchise (along with Star Wars and Star Trek), it is undoubtedly 
very important that none of the Traveller aliens bring to mind Klingons, 
Romulans, Ewoks, or other well-known aliens from those Other 
Franchises(TM). 

That said, you are correct that we probably shouldn\'t be so particular 
about sticking to previous artistic renderings of Traveller aliens.  
Capturing the spirit is more important.

    'topic' => 'Disciples of the Bright Way',
    'body' => '     This chitchat of the effects of J-space on sanity reminds me of a 
     religious group from one of my campaigns a long time ago, (in a galaxy 
     far, far away...)
     
     The *Disciples of the Bright Way* are a sect that believe their deity 
     exists in jumpspace, and communicates directly with people while they 
     are in jump. They call the sight of J-space *The Face of the Deity* 
     and have a secret combination of drugs and meditation practices that 
     reduce (but not eliminate!) the insanity impact of viewing J-space. 
     
     They are generally not dangerous, but their disturbing practice of 
     shooting up drugs and staring out of an open porthole into J-space 
     during the week of a jump means that most captains will refuse to 
     allow them on board under *any* circumstances. 
     
     However, the Disciples will pay an *obscene* amount of money for 
     passage on a ship, and since they don\'t care about bodily comforts 
     they are quite happy to bunk two to a stateroom under middle passage 
     conditions, and pay up to Cr25,000 each for their \'pilgrimage\'. 
     
     The Disciples also own a number of ships that they use for their own 
     *pilgrimages*; these are generally decrepit old Scout/Couriers or Free 
     Traders that have been roughly remodelled to hold dozens of 
     whacked-out weirdos in bunk/flop-house style accommodation. These ships 
have a disturbing number of portholes and viewports...
     
     Adventure ideas: 
     IDEA 1. 
     The PCs are in *dire* need of cash, and take on a number of 
     Disciples. The nutters spend most of the time in jump staring out of 
     the windows. 
     They are little trouble, since they prefer to spend their time 
     drooling and gibbering while they stare out the porthole, but a small 
     proportion of them can have unpredictable mental instabilities (hey, 
     they *are* loonies after all!). While they are not babbling at *The 
     Face of God* (who must get pretty sick of all this after awhile), they 
     will wander the ship, trying to convert the crew and other passengers 
     to their faith; 
     Disciple: "Hey man, have you ever looked out the window while you\'re 
     in jump? It\'s really coooollll..."
     Engineer: "You again? Would you just f$#k off!!???"
     D: "Hey, you wouldn\'t be so uptight if you just took a little 
     peek...hey, is this a window? " 
     E: "Get away from there NOW!" <draws snub pistol and strikes red alert 
button> 
     D: "Oh wow man, I\'m going to become a martyr..." 
     
     You get the idea. 
     
     
     IDEA 2. 
     The PCs are trapped on an unpleasant world, or are mercenaries who 
     have need to call on their repatriation bonds, and the only transport 
     available is on a Disciple ship. Refs with a sadistic bent can have *lots* 
of fun with this one. 

          
     IDEA 3. 
     As in 1. or 2., the PCs are desperate enough to link up with the 
     Disciples for a jump. Unfortunately they have fallen into the hands of 
     a breakaway sect that believes in one (or more) of the following: 
     a. Suiciding by leaping out into *The Face of God*. They will leave 
     the PCs alone, but the sight is going to be pretty disturbing. For 
     added pathos, make sure there are plenty of children, pets, old people 
     and the like. 
     b. That since God is J-space, the jump grid is actually preventing 
     them from achieving nirvana. You can guess the rest. ;]
     c. Sacrificing unbelievers to their God. Hilarity follows. This can 
     either be deadly serious, or played like a 60s sitcom. 
     d. They are seeking the promised land, a planet of milk, honey and 
     hallucinogenic drugs, to which their God is about to take them if they 
     only abandon themselves to the Face of God (ie, misjump). They will 
     deliberately try to misjump the ship - be imaginative! 
     
     This last idea should only be played after the PCs have encountered 
     the Disciples a few times, and have come to the conclusion that they 
     are a safe, if annoying, source of plenty of cash. 

     Have fun!

I don\'t think Traveller fusion power is *that* cheap. (Anyone
ever wworked out what the cost per kw-hour is, by the way?) Vaporising a
million tons of rock to extract the UnObTanium is an awful lot of power;
10^15 joules, maybe - a month\'s work for a gigawatt fusion plant, which 
costs as much as a small starship. Far cheaper to send the small starship to the
Unobtanium Pits of Alpha Centauri.

There will also be various radioactives that just plain don\'t 
exist except in young star systems - there are probably planets 
around stars in Orion where you can mine raw Pu238 and Pu239, fresh from the
supernova that triggered the formation of their system, for example.

Partly true.  Another reason that \'over-the-top\' was used was to force
soldiers to really attack , rather than faking it.  You see, because units
often occupied the same trenches for long periods of time, they developed
informal truces with the opposition.  

I particularly remember the case where a British platoon was nearly hit
outside of \'shooting hours\': they retaliated, until a German officer waved a
flag, stood up (unarmed), _apologized_, and said he hoped no one was hurt! 
Apparently a new unit of \'damn Bavarians\' had moved up to the Front who
didn\'t know the rules yet.

There are many documented cases of attacks that always hit the same place at
the same time. When an attack was ordered, men often shot high.  When
everyone had to go over the top (and stragglers were shot) then the officers
knew that the men were really attacking - and the enemy had no choice but to
really defend themselves.

Not as much as you might think.. it is still a matter of seizing the high
ground, and engaging the enemy and destroying him by using fire, shock, and
manoeuver.  The tools have changed, but the end result is the same.. the
infantry putting its foot on your chest and planting the flag.

Artillery still works best en masse, when the fire of dozens of tubes can be
brought to bear on a single target.  The proliferation of ammo types,
especially ICM, reduces the number of tubes overall, but you always have
more enemy than fire missions, so it\'s always nice to have few extra on call.

I think you underestimate the fear value of having huge bloody animals
charging directly at *you*.  Cavalry has many uses beyond flanking and
skirmishing; recon, courier, raiding the enemy rear, etc.

WWI was aturning point.. Europe had been mostly at peace for many years, and
the hide-bound General Staffs considered the growing conflict as one more
chance for a little glory.  They had no idea of what was coming.  It is
almost impossible to blame them.  The British hadn\'t even switched to
*rifles* until 1889.  The German technological advantage kept the war going,
until the Allies came up with countermeasures.

If you want a reason that the war was such a slaughter.. blame the
telephone.  Commanders on both sides set up in comfortable villas miles from
the front, and never saw the frontlines.  Many junior officers who suffered
through this became the fighting generals of WWII.

The main German advantage was Guerdian\'s(sp?) brain.  The early German tanks
were vastly inferior to French models, and the French Army was larger than
the Wehrmacht.  What killed France was years of preperation to fight the
last war.  World War II wasn\'t really more fluid than its predecessors.  A
close look at history shows that with the exception of North Africa, all the
campaigns moved at about the same pace as Napoleon did!

Strategic thinking had to adapt to the new reality during war.  The US
considered the loss of the Pacific battleship fleet to be devastating; until
Coral Sea and Midway showed that sea warfare had changed and that it was a
new game out there.

In my Traveller universe, Marines travel in one platoon Drop Ships, roaming
their assigned subsector, meeting of ships of the Regiment for training
excercises.  This gives a Marine presence in most systems on a near
continous basis.

I draw the line at giving a Naval Ground Force Lt. the keys to any nuclear
aresenal, the are inventive enough on their own.

The discussion of where ground and air vehicles merge is complex, but I will
say that my vision of grav tanks look more like attack copters than tanks.
As for the personal aids, we found that the basic infatryman doesn\'t need
the distractions.. his job is to kill.

Well, I have to wonder about the "continental level" comment.. Warfare is
about controlling *points*: a harbor, starport, pass, radio center,
whatever..  You could control the United States by controling the frieght
yards in Kansas City and Chicago, and selected highway interchanges.
Congradulations!  You have just cut of the food supply to 85% of the United
States!

Remember Murphy!  One of your thousands of of TL4 crossbowmen is going to
get a shot into a visorslit, or a joint, or the airtank regulator..  If you
are facing 16,000 men, a one-in-a-thousand event will hapen 16 times.

I used this to demonstrate why battledress is not a cure all.  I had a
friend build a TL14 squad in battledress, then I built an unarmored company
for the same funds.  All my troops were armed with RAM grenades.  While I
took heavy casulties, my return fire destroyed the squad.

This has BEVER been addressed in traveller (a friend of mine keeps saying 
that in Traveller, you are always refighting WW2). What do you guys think?

You\'ve never played in my games.

>What do you feel is going on with Cleon (his goals, coming to power, the way
>the government is set up, etc.)

I have been looking over some of my old CT/MT materials regarding the Sylean
Federation. It was formed in -650 and ruled by a body called the Grand
Senate. The federation had a tightly controlled and centralized government.
Cleon was a Solomani noble born in -57 who headed an industrial consortium.
He obtained behind the scenes control and began his campaign in -30.

Some points of interest:
1) Cleon was an industrialist rather than a soldier.  The canon discusses
how the Imperium grew by exerting economic and political pressure on
backward cultures rather than through conquest.  I tend to agree with John
Macpherson that the Imperium\'s growth was similar to the American, Russian,
and English experiences rather than Napoleon\'s, Hitler\'s, Ghengis Khan\'s,
Alexander\'s, Tamberlane\'s, etc.  These conquering heroes made big names for
themselves, but their empires were ephemeral.  Cleon, like them, wanted to
strike fear in the hearts of men throughout the ages, but was smart enough
not to live or die by the sword.  Smart like Augustus.

2) The nobles and megacorps both have a lot to gain under Cleon.  They get a
free hand in the less centralized Imperium and benefit from the aggressive
expansion.

3)  Cleon could give the nobility, megacorps, navy, and IISS competing roles
in Imperial expansion.  They would then have to turn to him to resolve
disputes over turf on the frontier.  Cleon uses expansionism as a way to
focus the attention of other powerful interests onto each other.  Divide and
conquer.
  
4) The federation had nobles, because Cleon was one.

5) Cleon was a noble involved in big business.  Was that generally the case
in the federation, or did the nobility have its traditional dislike for
those who earn their bread?  Maybe the source of Cleon\'s power is his
ability to unite the nobility and business interests.  If they are not one
in the same, they would normally be at odds.

6) Cleon has been plotting since -30, about the same time he started
producing fusion+.  If we assume that political systems only change in times
of chaos, the disorders which led to the break down of the federation
probably started before that.  As he has the fusion+ monopoly, Cleon was a
major player from -30 forward.  Perhaps he covertly contributed to
subsequent instability in the federation.  After he is crowned, the
disorders stop and everybody wonders why they did not make him emperor years
ago.

What could cause such disorders?  Some guesses: economic dislocation from
fusion+; a lost war; democratic rebels; anticapitalist rebels (fka
communists); revolts by a minor race; revolts by colonials; Vargr
incursions; a plague from a newly colonized world; a military coup;
inflation from expanding exports; bloody feuds between noble houses; some
costly campaigns on the frontier.

On another note, what happened to Cleon Industries?  Did it pass to the
Lentulis as crown property, or did the holdings remain in Zhunastu hands?
My guess is that it became Sternmetal and went to Cleon II\'s heirs.

Seriously, I plan to start a Travellerisk PBEM on the net sometime late
this year.  I\'m getting a Traveller PBEM game going on Fidonet (in the
SF&ANIME_RPG echo) right now, and it\'ll be 2 or 3 months before I\'m ready
to start another.

The net game is going to be based around a Far Trader working along a
mostly unexplored \'main\' near the end of the Long Night.  The crew will be
independents scraping out a living with speculative trade, casual passenger
transport, and the occasional contract job.  They will have to content with
pirates both private and government
sponcered, crediters, outdated maps, old equipment, and everything else I
can throw at them.  <g>

Copyrights (to the best of my decidedly non-legal knowledge) and
trademarks are tangible assets, which can be disposed of however the
company going defunct desires. All trademark and copyright properties
to Traveller went to Marc Miller (AKA Far Future Enterprises), per

> history happens.  There are no USMC units involved.

Roosevelt (for reasons best known to himself) sent all of the USMC to
the Pacific (with a few exceptions such as the Marines on Iceland)

I always found it odd that _no_ officer involved in Overlord had
been involved in _any_ of the amphibious operations in the Pacific
(none that I know of, anyway). They were two separate wars,
effectively.

Re Scales: In the good old days, before proportional scales came
along, figures were measured from the eyes to the ground, i.e., 30mm
was 30mm eyes to ground, to minimize the effect of any headgear --
the problem was, not all manufacturers did this, some just did shoes
to top of hat = 30mm or 54mm or whatever. While there is general
agreement that 25mm = 1/76, etc. there are no hard and fast standards
(like in model railroading and model aircraft. With minis, you have to
know that Minifigs (for example) produces "large" 15s (anybody here
old enough to remember the Scruby 9mm figures...the ones that were
really 12mms?

Ummm sometimes, sometimes not...The Roman\'s real secret, IMHO, was to
subvert the local bigwigs over to the Roman side by various means. If
the locals were co-operative, they stayed on and prospered. If not,
they ended up like Queen Zenobia (extra points if you can name her
husband).

Again, sometimes, sometimes not. There were a lot of local
regulations, free allied cities, client states, and so on.

It\'s like being hung (the "tie a rope around your neck and haul you up"
type not the "drop you to the end of the rope" type). It\'s only fatal
if nobody does anything within the next 5 minutes or so.

"Death by drowning" does not inevitably follow "drowning".

Jerry Pournelle says he (and by implication, others) underwent

vacuum, doesn\'t say how long. He did say he wouldn\'t do it again.

Anyone who thinks that high-tech vs low-tech means an automatic win for
the high tech folks is either assuming overwhelming numerical
superiority. or *really* dumb low-techs.

Against *intelligent* low-techs, the high-tech had better be *very*
good, or else they\'ll get handed their heads on a platter.

Luckily for most forces, brains aren\'t terribly common at any tech

Having asked the original question, I could take a stab at
this.

MWM says he took the name from C.S.Lewis  (In the Chronicles
of Narnia, Lewis has a allegorical Jesus Christ in the form
of a lion called Aslan).

Lewis would appear to taken the name from the Turkish word.
(I have no direct evidence for this but given his friendship
with Tolkien and Tolkien\'s love for language, it makes a lot
of sense).

While it would make a lot sense for the name to have
originated with a Turkish Solomani explorer and might well be
\'true\', I have been unable to find any Traveller source
(unless it is in TNE material) that suggests this is the case.

Perhaps someone would like to write a scenario outlining the
\'first contact\'.  Anybody know off hand *when* it was?

If you\'ve got the basic TNE book the Fat Trader is listed in the 
starships in the rear as the Subsidized Merchant.  Same ship different 
name.  Course if I hadn\'t seen deckplans for the Fat Trader and the 
Subsidized merchant I\'d never have reallized that.

If you misjump into the middle of the Abyss Rift and you don\'t have 
enough fuel left for a calcuated misjump back from whence you came you 
are SOL, screwed in the biggest sence of the word etc etc etc...

You could do the comet thing if you could find one, they don\'t call it 
space for nothing, there\'s a lot of it out there.  You thing you feel 
insignificant laying on your back in a Sackastchewan field in the middle 
of the night, wait till you step out the airlock in the middle of the 
Abyss Rift.

Ships could be designed with a 1 parsec reserve, infact ships with heplar 
already have this potential built in, with grav-thrusters you\'re in a bit 
more of a problem.  Designing a 1 jump reserve is a bit of a contentious 
issue, sure it\'s a safety thing but that\'s a lot of cargo space you\'re 
loosing just for the sake of being safe and given the low frequency of 
misjumps I don\'t thing anyone really cares.  \'Tis like getting on a 
plane,  plane crashes and misjumps always happen to other people.

Again, potentially, you\'d have to find them first of course.  And you\'ve

Yes, Yes!  One of my groups had a decidely mercenary bent.  They also

On this point, I\'ll disagree with you. Commodity trading will still be common,
especially (and possibly only) agricultural commodities. True, with fusion, 
water and elements are fairly easily obtainable, but that still doesn\'t mean it will
be cheap to produce ag products in some places. Also, I suspect that many companies
will use basic comodities for production, after ship crews and mining colonies need 
to eat. Also, as planets experience cyclical weather patterns, they may be an exporter
one year and an importer ten years later. Also, raiders and war, especially a logistical
war will be very hard on basic productions, resulting in the need for commodities. 

For example The Federation of Flom and the Dominion of Sludge are at war. The Flommites
get a good shot in and destroy not only the orbital shipyards, but the central 
processing facilities in the astroid belt. Until that production facility is restored, 
the Sludgies will be importing commodities (at a premium price).

If in response, the Sludgies manage a high-v rock drop on the the Flommites, the 
Flommites will be shipping basic food supplies in, until the climate stablizes and
"the dust settles":)

Also, if this is a post collapse universe you are using, many planets may have lost fusion
and be system bound or travelling on purchased packets (e.g. I can buy and operate a car, 
but I couldn\'t build an engine to save my life) and not have access to the capital equipment
to run such an operation as you refer to, whereas Joe Merchant can run his monster carrier
in once a year and under-cut all the local boys. Will Joe be selling tech as well? I doubt
it.

* Different subspecies of Aslan;  1) the canon never mentions it. :)


 If you compare them to Homo Sapiens, then the only variations you
are 

 likely to see are height/skin/fur/eye color/skin surface area/fat...


 The Aslans have been in space for a very short time, much too short 

 for subspecies to devellop in isolated areas.  Also there are 

probably  behavioristic reasons for a certain degree of similarity 

 between the Aslans; they live in clans and looking like the rest of 

 the members of your clan is an important thing.  Now, maybe all that


 this means is that the clans don\'t look like each other. :) 

  

       And about artistic license: It\'s fine with me as long as the 

 artist is being creative.  As far as I can see, in this case the 

artist wasn\'t creative at all!  He merely stuck fur and makeup on a 

 guy.  And what would you think if an artist used his \'artistic
license\' 
 to color a  

 Stormtrooper purple with pink dots for a Star Wars movie? 

Consistency  is one of the main tenet of creating a gaming
universe... 

 If I don\'t want consistency, I\'ll go play Rifts. :)  

  

       Marc Miller has stated it in his presentation of T4: 

Travelle r is based on Science, both soft and hard.  Meaning that 

consi stency IS important to his gaming universe.  Meaning that the 

 artist SHOULD have examined the bone/muscle structure of the aslan 

 "model" (all real artists are trained to do that).  Where he COULD 

hav e been creative (and failed - it\'s not the same thing as not
being 

 consistent, Not being consistent means everybody hates your picture,


 not being creative means that nobody notices it) is in the aslan\'s 

 clothing and weaponry.  He SHOULD have been dressed in the aslan 

equiv alent of medieval clothes.  HE was dressed in a klingon suit. 

  

 Where are the exotic jewelry and ornaments?  The thigh bones of wild


 carnivores?  The funky helmets that prop the mane straight up?  

 Tail-bells?  DGP\'s aslan module has a section dedicated to Aslan 

 clothing.  They say "tasteful and subtle".  Those 2 spikes on the 

 elbows of that aslan are definitely not SUBTLE. :)  Maybe he\'s 

 an aslan assassin though. :) (though they claim he\'s a warrior) 

  
Anyways - that\'s just my not-so-humble opinion. :)  If *I* could
 draw, I would, and send that in to IG. :)  But I can\'t so I\'ll
 just rant about it. :)
 
 Here\'s a short rundown of what I\'d like to see on an 

 aslan warrior:  hard-soled boots, baggy embroidered pants, covered 

 by a knee-length white \'kilt\' (just a front and back panel, no
sides, 

 and pleated).  On his belt, he wears a soberly colored pouch, easy
to 

 reach in case the warrior is mortally wounded and wants to give 

himsel t the \'extreme unction\'.   The pouch has a thick protective  

 metal plate with gems and hieroglyphs of the name of his
forefathers. 

  

 The aslan\'s stomach area is covered only by lose bands of clothing, 

 usually unarmored.  His chest is covered with a thick armor plate, 

 with big, striking blasons of his family and clan.  The back is 

 covered in the same manner.  Under this armor is worn a baggy shirt 

 or the same bands-like clothing as on the tummy.  Over it all is 

 occasionally worn a long tabard (not sure if this is hte right name,


 it\'s a long rectangular piece from the neck to the ankles) with  

 more insignias.  Usually worn by officers and leaders.  Softly 

 contoured leather wristbands or cuffs are ever-present and can
double 

 as \'pockets\'.   (oh, btw the tabard doesn\'t have to be symmetrical).


 Shoulder armor when worn is curved and sloping downwards.  Headgear,


 when worn, should leave the ears free and emphasise the mane.  I\'m 

 thinking of a variant of the samurai helmet with \'wings\' that hold 

 the mane up.  That would look kinda scary. :)  Gloves have a  

 slit for the dewclaw.   Sometimes warriors will go as far as tinting


 their fur with bright/fluo markings.   

  

 In any and all case, the most important piece of equipment will be 

 the aslan\'s weapons.  Exquisitely decorated, ornate, and deadly. 

 I suppose a katana or ninja-to IS a human\'s idea of that kind of 

 weaponry... :) It should look too unwieldy for human hands.
 
 Basic wearponry for a warrior would probably be something like
 an Akhaeh, a khaihte on the wristbands or takhestah, and a 
 yeheal or trolitakheal depending on the tech level.  Modern
 aslans would probably wear a knife as their biggest blade weapon,
 more \'medieval\' aslans might wear actual swords.  Basically, 
 adapt the guidelines above according to materials and technology.
 
 Micahel Vilardi\'s aslan pictures are just incredible. :)

This sound like an excuse for either an illustrator who didn\'t do their
homework or ,as I suspect after hearing about the quality of the equipment
illustrations in T4, more likely a company that failed to provide sufficient
guidance and/or resource material to the illustrator.

Well, I\'m not sure how it works *real* artist, but this is pretty much the
way it is for *real* illustrators.  Art directors are always asking for
changes in artwork and any illustrator that is unwilling to accommodate them
will very quickly find themselves not working.

This is one of the things that make illustrating hard.  Sometime you have to
produce even when the tap is off.  This is what make a *real* illustrator.

Ashe Marler\'s Aslan concept sketch is very well done and I look forward to
seeing Marler\'s work in future Traveller products.  However,  the character
in the concept sketch does look like more like a member of "Cats", as
someone else mention, than an Aslan. Actually it looks like Arnold
Schwarzenegger starring in "Cats".

Fat Trader is the slang for Subsidized Merchant.  There are definitely

Couldn\'t disagree with you more...  OK, the romance portions of the 
novel on Iceland are awkward, but this was a great WW3 scenario (at 
least when USSR vs. NATO scenarios were somewhat plausible) that even 
my wife got into.  However, as a romance novelist, Clancy is a great 
author of technothrillers.  BTW, Red Storm Rising is NOT a Jack Ryan 
novel, which your last paragraph would seem to imply...

His worst:  Excluding Op Center, which he doesn\'t really write...
Patriot Games...  How ridiculous does it look to portray the Prince & 
Princess of Wales as having a healthy, normal relationship 
now...frankly, it even looked silly then.  Clancy is best when he writes 
hard fiction, and is frankly an awkward writer at best about relationships...
which he spends way too much time doing in Patriot Games...

His Best:  Personal opinion is that he\'s going to have a hard time 
topping The Sum of All Fears again in a future novel.  I thought Red October 
was his best until I read SOAF...

And just what the heck does this thread have to do with Traveller, 
btw... :-P

Also no one commented on attachments to the hull that aren\'t wired into the

Actually, I think I will argue this point, considering the fact that the 
Galaxy is a three-dimensional structure, and the Traveller abstraction of 
one Hex represents a column of space several light-years tall (well, 
thats the way *I* interpret the hex, one could also argue that the hex 
system is just a J-space representation of N-space, meaning comparing 
N-space distances on a subsector map is, well, silly)

My opinion is that Hexes *could* contain rogue comets, stars with no 
solar system, stars with nascent systems with no large solid bodies, 
brown dwarfs (source of the dark matter cosmologists wrangle about, I 
imagine them as sorta like rogue gas giants, stars that haven\'t lit up 
yet) or any number of things.

That much space is unlikely to be really empty, the problem is that there 
is so much space between all the cool stuff there. How long would it take 
to travel from one side of the hex to the other with M-Drives? Well, in a 
case such as this relatavistic effects would need to be accounted 
for...suffice it to say it would be a long time, probably longer than the 
standard year Power Plants are charged for, and certainly longer than 
life support would last. (I\'ve always assumed, that for most commercial 
vessels, you must pay for 2 weeks of life support before jumping for each 
passenger, this is canon isn\'t it? I\'m sure I\'ve read it somewhere...so 
what is the maximum that one could stretch life support? And the maximum 
time that you could "stock up on" before jumping?)

In most cases I would agree. BUT...my take on jump drives is that you 
*require* 
a large mass in n-space in order to exit jump space. It is for this 
reason that you must exit outside of 100 dia. of a body. You need the 
mass, but you can\'t be too close. There was an article about Jump Points, 
etc. in one of the old JTAS magazines, #15 I think?

The problem is, is that body a star? If so, yer screwed. If it is a large 
rogue comet or a brown dwarf, it\'s your lucky day.

Again, I would agree. The difficulty is really in finding any misjumped 
vessels, should they exist. Do you know what the EM signature of a 
derelict ship is? I can guess that it\'s as close to zero as any stealth 
equipped ship. And your chances of finding it are infinitesimal--you 
probably don\'t own enough dice to roll for them chances.

Of course, since the most likely reason you\'re going to find a 
derelict in deep space is the result of a misjump.  The equivalent of 
searching the sealanes really wouldn\'t apply, since a misjump 
necessarily would be the equivalent on a transatlantic Europe-US trip 
and crash landing in Antarctica...  and the Antarctica in question is 
uncharted, and several orders of magnitude bigger.  

I\'d suspect you\'d have more luck searching for derelict ships in some 
of the backwater systems...

  This is contrary to the philosophy of the Imperial marines.

  Take a look at the Imperial Marine APC. As early as Striker (the
original, not II) or even book 4 - the APC has *one* main weapon (a
rapid-pulse fusion gun) and several *nuclear* tac missiles.

  This is expanded upon in the Regency Equipment Guide: The APC is
nick-named "the big stick". 

  "It is no accident that the vehicle has no low-lethality secondary
weapons. It literally has no ability to respond to provocation while
limiting damage, for that is not it\'s job.
  "The fact that it is entirely armed with nuclear tac missiles and a
fusion gun was well-advertised and the message was clear: when the Marines
arrive, the party is over, and no half-measures will be taken."

	Don\'t forget Bannockburn!  The Scots defeated the flower of

before either of the battles you mention.  Bannockburn was 1314 
while Agincourt wasn\'t until 100 years later in 1415.

Are you sure they\'re big?  I\'ve noticed a tendency for jarheads to be

One issue with this: the ex grunt/swabbie with field/fleet experience
may not be ready to play the academy head games.  A shipmate of mine
went enlisted USN Nuc, which proves his academic ability, then after
about 2 years fleet time got an appointment to the Navy Academy.  

He was in a pre-school indotrination program where they make sure your
academics are up to snuff and treat you like your plebe year.  Well,
with a bit of fleet time and attitude, being treated like the scum on
the underside of whale s--t by college sophomores with _zero_ real world
expereience didn\'t go over too well.  Let\'s just call it personal
incompatability.

Fortunately, there were some good people in charge of the program. 
Rather than blackballing him as an attitude case, they officially
dropped him from the program for \'academic deficiencies\', which
thoretically means he couln\'t hack the scholastic load - definitely not
the case.  No adverse marks on his records and no damage to his
carreer.  Rather decent of them, actually.

Point being that, in many cases, OCS or ROTC (yeah, send the boy or girl
to college) might be the better option.  Or maybe a Limited Duty Officer
(LDO) program like the USN has, where with significant enlisted
experience you can get a commission without a degree, although
advancement and type of assignment are limited.  Of course, making some
of these ideas playable is another issue. :-)

This I _like_!  If someone were to come up with a matrix of various
ranking systems across various services/nationalities, it could be a
very handy tool.

And the Navy in the bleachers, letting the Marines do the light work. 
Not that the Army is any threat to the Marines, except maybe just from
sheer numbers.

        I\'m sending you a copy of the Core sector data. That\'s the closest I
can get, since I\'ve never found an IBM program out there that can dice those
sector files up into their component subsectors. However, I noticed
something when comparing the sector file to the Core Subsector in the back
of T4; Capital/Sylea\'s UWP was the same except for tech level. Everything
else was completely different.

answer (IMHO) is that they must have a jump grid incorporated in them.
Drop tanks would have a grip which "plugs into" the ship\'s grid.  Things
like jump bubbles and jump nets would have grids running through them and
would similarly hook into the ship\'s grid.

Regarding people hanging onto the hull, I figure if you survive entry into
jump space (and my intuition is that the jump field would protect you),
you\'d be okay long enough to get into an air lock.  There are a couple of
difficulties to overcome, however.  One is actually hanging on.  Depending
at what rate the ship is accelerating, this might be difficult.  The
other, as someone mentioned, is the power going through the jump grid.  I
think if you were careful not to touch grid lines of opposite charge (or
whatever) then you\'d be okay (say Difficult, Int, Dex, Engineering?).
You\'d also have to be very careful to start directly at the hull and not
look into jump space.

	Yes and no, part of the popular appeal of the Imperium may have 
been as a vehicle for controlling the megacorps.  Cleon probably spoke 
out of both sides of his mouth on this one, giving the people populist 
rhetoric while telling the \'corps "don\'t worry, I\'m one of you."  The 
realities of power being what they are, once he ascended to the throne he 
probably did exert his control over the \'corps, or subverted them to his 
aims.

	And by forcing them all to come to him he increases his power and 
options.  FDR (Franklin Delano Roosevelt for the non-yanks) is said to 
have played his aides and secretaries off against each other very 
skillfully this way.

	I think that nobles would be involved in business, at least the
younger sons, because of the "honor" factor that MM describes as being an
important part of Year 0.  Running an interstellar corporation requires a
great deal of trust that subordinates a subsector or whole sector away
will carry out your orders faithfully.  This makes a good reputation a key
to advancement.  Because of their position and visibility, nobles are
likely to jealously guard their reputation.  A "commoner" might be tempted
to "take the money and run" because he could always disappear into the
frontier and change his identity.  Ex-military officers would be another
good source of executives because of their experience and their investment
in a reputation. 
	When it comes to reputation, the longer a bad one sticks with you,
and the greater the benefits of maintaining a good one, the more jealously
people will guard it.  For this reason, people from "good families" with
children of their own will be favored for positions of responsibility
because the cost of defection would reach all their relatives and their
own children. Note that this is different from the image of the "young 
hot-shot" who comes in and starts setting the world on fire.  Such people 
would be regarded as dangerous and destabilizing rather than merely 
ambitious.

	Just the expansion of the empire itself could cause a good deal 
of disruption.  The megacorps could have been engaged in a kind of "land 
rush" into the new markets of the wilds.  This might have caused rapid 
economic expansion on some worlds or in some industries, and rapid 
decline in others.  If the worlds of Sylean Federation were all used to 
being economically insular, the rapidly growing competition from other 
worlds both in and out of the Federation, coupled with the real or 
perceived ineffectivenss of existing political institutions could have 
created the desire among the people of the Federation for someone, 
anyone, to _do_ something.  
	Cleon, as a kind of futuristic Ross Perot, just stepped forward
into the gap.

The reason humans and vargr have different subspecies, is because
Grandfather and his kids mucked with their DNA.  Some of the

What sort of devices might be on a starship to control a fire?  I imagine the 
iris valves would shut (sort of like a distant cousin to the flood control on 
a submarine) leaving crew members to die of 
suffocation/immolation/decompression, but what of the fuel tankage?  Is the 
fuel tankage one huge emty space, or does it have pumps, valves and pipes that 
would control the supply during a leak or fire situation?
Wouldn\'t the ship\'s computer shut off hydrogen and oxygen in the event of a 
fire?  Perhaps it would kill some crew and passengers, but would possibly save 
others?  What do you think?

Yes most died by jumping out or were burned by the engine fuel. Only one was killed 
by the hydrogen fire. He was on top of the airship.

	    Formidable    he is ok

Aha!  For some of us, more than you might think.  I have managed to work up a 
_bunch_ of scenarios and min-campaigns for Traveller based on Clancy.  My 
favorite involved the theft of a new Solomani Intruder with a revolutionary new 
type of Black Globe.   We did this one way back in the past; when Hunt for Red 
October was only available from Naval Institute Press.  

A few months later, I was caught; one of my players got the Random House 
edition when it came out.

I\'ve also used other Clancy bits; the research station attack in Cardinal of 
the Kremlin became the backdrop of a merc contract (Research Station hires 
mercs to defend against angry Chirpers without alerting the Imperial 
authorities to the situation), the back-country romp from Red Storm Rising 
(four PCs get caught behind the lines of an occupied Imperial world during the 
Zhodani invasion, and guide hidden SDBs until Imperial reinforcements arrive), 
the rescue of the terrorists on the Ferry in Patriot Games (PCs as guards; had 
to make some new PCs after that one - oops).  The first attempt was pretty 
derivative, but I\'ve tried to disguise the others better, and I\'ve only been 
caught well after the fact (if at all).

Dear me, how could I forget Robert The Bruce\'s triumph with _Braveheart_ and all that?

I know, Gibson didn\'t _quite_ get all the facts straight in the film, it\'s just that Far 
Too Many of My Friends[tm] were _really_ taken by the film. At least _you_ got yours 
right.

Thanks for reminding me that there are few forces in the universe more formidable or 
fascinating than Scottish pride, John.

The Magnum Pistol DR of 3 makes sense, given that the autopistol, body pistol and SMG 
have a DR of 2. A DR of 10 exceeds that of a laser rifle (7)!

That\'s a possibility. Reminds me of the end of the John Belushi movie _Animal House_ 
where when "What happened to (character X)" was rolled. The obnoxious, self-important 
ROTC cadet was "Killed in Vietnam by his own men." Of course, most of the -DM can come 
about from that aphorism about the three most dangerous men in any service: a commando 
with a knife, a cook with a grudge, and a O-1 with a map.

I take it that in the Commonwealth system that warrant officers are not the 
betwixt-and-between creatures they are in the US system, that they _are_ NCOs, period. I 
also take it that for chain-of-command purporses, the progression goes SGT to CSM to 
RSM, aka a God with six stripes who walks. Hell, it makes more sense to _this_ 
ex-naval Yank than our Army\'s system.

Yes, _RSR_ was a great WW3 scenario. As one who greatly enjoyed General Sir John 
Hackett\'s _WW3: August 1985_ and _WW3: The Untold Story_, I have to agree. Yep, Clancy 
_couldn\'t_ write romance well at the time he wrote _PG_  . . . but he got _much_ better 
in that department in _Without Remorse_.

Didn\'t follow the Charles and Di show back then . . . too busy gaming. ;) I agree 
with what you\'re saying. Then again, given the clumbsiness with which TC portrays 
relationships, the action scenes were good enough that readers may not have noticed.

Somehow, I wasn\'t all that distressed by Clancy\'s poor handling of the relationships in 
_PG_. I was more unhappy with Clancy\'s attempt to write a la Le Carre in _Cardinal_, 
which is why I rate _TCotK_ lower than _PG_.

He\'s had three tries to top _TSoAF_, and  _EO_ comes closest. _HfRO_ is _still_ TC\'s 
best.

Who cares? <evil grin> Well, Trav is a sf game, and TC writes a sort of sf . . . . 
There\'s all those good ideas for plot elements and characters. I\'ll write up Ryan as a 
Traveller character to bring the thread back onto topic.

 I\'m not willing to rule this possibility out, if this the the
 general sense of the lists - or if IG says you\'ve got it right.
 But remember that this is Year 0, a lot earlier in history than
 we\'re used to thinking of in Traveller.  During the period of
 history on this planet when Burma was the preeminent supplier
 of oil, we didn\'t have any Exxon-Valdez class supertankers
 delivering the stuff, either.  That\'s approximately what I\'m
 suggesting in the kickoff post.

 Yes.  If they weren\'t, they\'d most likely be classed as Goods,
 not Commodities.

 Whoops, you\'re right - this is obviously a recent change; my
 1973 almanac shows them in the same zone, with Yukon one hour
 west of Pacific.  My 1994 almanac shows your correction.

 Most Americans (from the US, that is, and by no means all of
 them) are rather more parochial about knowledge of the
 relationship between the US and the rest of the world than are
 most other people.  I assumed that any Canadians on this list
 were cognizant of both their time zones (which overlap the US
 time zones), and the relationships to UTC (which the rest of
 the world can be assumed to know).  That post was just for
 those who didn\'t know at all from American parochial time zone
 naming conventions.

IMHO, they would be involved in big business.  If there is one thing 
the rich want it is to, at the very least, stay rich, if not get 
richer than their nearest peer.  If some portion of a generation think 
they can freeload, someone, somewhere in line to inherit the title 
will realize they have a vested interest in making sure that the 
family assets have lots of little baby assets.

Well... One of my characters "Thul Jonson" (pronounced "tool yon-sun") was a
bounty hunter.  A very successfull one at that.  What follows here is a yarn
of how his career started.  This was a campaign that I played under while I
was in the US Navy.  Hopefully some insight can be gained by my ramblings.
Some of the individual details may be different than the original campaign
as it was a long, long, time ago and I don\'t even have Thul\'s character
sheet anymore. (I LOST IT <sob!>)  

Thul has also put in an appearance during the Elissa PBEM that was going for
a few years there... 


Thul\'s  schtick was repossesion of ships that had skipped.  He would search
the skip lists that were posted at various starports or with banks and go
looking.  

His success rate was so high that he became notorious and that notoriety
forced him out of the business, but it was not without lasting reward. I am
getting ahead of myself...

Thul was an ex-Marine Colonel who in spite of a glorious career was forced
out of the Imperial Marines during a RIF program. Seems he pissed off
somebody by not giving one of his subordinates a good fitness report.  Just
because this subordinate was the son of ... well we won\'t go into that.

Anyway.  Things being what they were there wasn\'t much work for a ex-Marine
Colonel who had seen lots of action to do.  Well... when somebody botched
the attempt (they all died) to reposses the ship that he had hitched passage
on after discharge this got Thul thinking.  After making planetfall, he
found out who held the mortgage on the ship.  Found the local office of the
bank and did some discreet inquiries.  Yes, they said, they paid 0.75% of
the principal on the loan for ships recovered. Yes, we keep lists of skipped
ships with holographs of their skippers... Oh.. but you need to have a
private investigator\'s license.  

Thul checked around and found out that PI licenses came in three basic
flavors.  Issued by a planetary government, issued at the sub-sector\'s
government seat, or issued by a sector government.   Well, the first one was
pretty limited, the last one damn near impossible to get, but the middle one
showed promise.  

The sub-sector\'s government seat was J2 away.  Find out who\'s going there... 

In the mean time, the captain of the ship that Thul arrived on was arrested
for use of forged papers.  Seems the way he was getting around this neck of
the woods without being discovered was by using the ship\'s papers for a
vessel that was lost with all hands aboard.  No-one is quite sure how this
mangy character managed to get a hold of the papers for that ship, but there
it is. He might have gotten away with it except that the sister of the lost
ship\'s captain tried to visit her brother when she saw that his ship was in.
The sister being a captain in her own right realized as soon as she saw the
ship that it wasn\'t her brother\'s ship and alerted the local authorities.

Well... Thul mused.. there went Cr150,000!  

Undaunted, he made his way to the SubSector capital.  Using his discharge
papers as letters of introduction, OBTW: Thul was knighted during his tours
of duty, but that\'s another story.  The fact that he was knighted seem to
help his cause some.  Six weeks later, (good thing he had things going for
him in his favor) he had his license. 

He also assembled a team of raiders.  Most of these folks were men and women
that served with him during his time in service.  Each were specialists in
their own field as well as being adept at arms and combat. 

A few trips to some banks, (and at the subsector seat there were plenty to
check), he started collecting lists of skipped ships.  With the economics of
the area being what they were, there were more skipped ships than one would
imagine.  

He also decided to diversify and see about wanted criminals and bond jumpers
as well.  He collected quite a list.  Seems that some folks in law
enforcement knew Thul from a while back... One, a Subsector Manager for the
IBI (Imperial Bureau of Investigation) had fond memories of Thul.  Seems
when this manager was a shave-tail leiutenant Thul carried him out of a
firefight after he had been severely wounded all the way back to an aide
station....

Armed with more information than they really needed Thul and his team set
off for the edge of the subsector.  

Now, an aside here...  this universe that I ran Thul in was a definite
variant of the classic GDW story line.  Seems that this subsector was on the
edge of the Imperium and what lie beyond the edge was the Traveller
equivelant of the Old West in the mid 1800\'s and though parts are settled,
they are not part of the Imperium proper.   With that backdrop, I\'ll
continue my story.

Along the edges of the subsector, life is cheap, booze is plentifull, and
you have to watch your every step.  Law is at the point of a weapon most
times and vigilantism is rampant.  

Thul\'s team consisted of the following:

             SERVICE                 SKILL
             DISCHARGED FROM         SET
 
             Scout                   Pilot, Commo, Computer
             Scout                   Elex, Navigator, Engineering
             Merchant                Engineering 
             Marine                  Lazer Weps, Demolitions
             Marine                  Heavy Weps, SMG, 0G Combat
             Marine                  Laser Weps 0G combat

The skills listed for the team are not the full skills, but what they were
best at. 

Their first mark was a suspected leader of an Inge Givar cell who had a
Cr500,000 reward on his head from the Imperium as well as Cr10,000 reward
from a bondsman that he skipped out on.  To make this part of the story
short (the rest of this is long enough!) there was a firefight that broke
out between Thul and the three ex-Marines he had on his team and the Inge
Givar that were trying to protect him.   None of the Inge Givar except the
leader survived.  One marine was wounded severely and was hospitalized.  The
manager of the hotel where the Inge Givar were staying were a bit snicked
out the door and the section of wall that were obliterated by the demolition
charge.. well never mind.  Thul eventually payed them for the damages and
all was forgiven...

Next, after delivering their prisoner to authorities they stumbled upon
something interesting.  Seems a ship that one of the Scout characters
spotted at a starport (Class C) had some unusual doings going on about it.
Seems, according to starport personell, the crew did not want anybody in the
engine room in spite of the fact that the crew were attempting to repair the
power plant.   "You don\'t want assistance?  We have good power plant
mechanics on staff... "  According to one of the mechanics at the starport
they had the feeling the crew was ill educated at fixing such things.  And
besides...  Their engineer quit on them...

This was discussed by the team.  A new arrival to the team, hired as a
replacement for the man wounded in the last go-around, started nosing around
the starport to find out what was going on...

The ship, a 600T vessel, was of a type that was normally used to run between
established routes.  What was it doing this far off the beaten path? 

The new guy turned out to be a god-send.  He located the ship\'s engineer.
Turns out he quit after not being paid for 4 months and was looking for
work.  He also said that he quit because the engines on this ship were an
accident waiting to happen.  He found out after a while that regular
shipyard maintenance had not been done in over 3 years!

This engineer was hired by Thul and payed two months pay in advance.  If the
engineer could talk his way back onto the ship and get an imprint of the
builder\'s plate that would be usefull information.

Well, the engineer did good.  He met Thul at a predesignated location and
using pre-arranged signals the imprint was delivered.   The engineer was
back working for his old boss, (or so his old boss thought) and working on
the sick power plant.  

The bad news was, Thul and his team would have to work fast.  The engineer
had managed to get the power plant working again, (the attempted repairs
made by the rest of the crew broke more than the original problem broke) and
they were making preparations to get underway.   

The ISSHRN was checked against the list that Thul had from the banks.  Sure
enough there was the ship.  And there\'s the skipper of the ship as well....
Except that he was the first officer when the ship was put on this list...
Wonder what happened to the original skipper?

Meanwhile, the checklist for getting underway progressed back at the
"Santaria Muse" as it was originally registered as...  At 15:52 local time a
harbor saftey team arrived at the gangway.  Seems that the harbormaster did
not want  this vessel to get underway without checking that the repairs on
the engineering spaces were properly certified. "Dammit back in \'67 we had
one of you tramp freighers blow up as they were leaving orbit! Debris
knocked out one of our comm-sats! It\'s not happening again!"

The skipper of the vessel called down to his gangplank watch and said "Tell
\'em to pound sand!  They don\'t have the right to come on my vessel if I
don\'t want them to.  This is my ship see..."  The skipper turned off the
intercom smug in the knowledge that these inspectors weren\'t coming aboard.
Hector and Darrius are pretty good men. They handle nosy people pretty well. 

About 3 minutes later the skipper\'s cabin door was rent open violently and
the skipper was knocked off of his desk chair by a shock wave and a rush of
hot air.  His ears ringing and his vision blurred rough hands rolled him on
his stomach and tie wrapped his hands together behined his back.  Ankles
similarly bound he wasn\'t going anywhere. Muffled popping was heard
elsewhere about the ship through his open door and a voice announced "All
secure Colonel!"

His vision barely clearing, his head throbbing with a headache to beat all
headaches, a man with baggy cammo pants, dark sweatshirt, with an unlit
cigar that had been chewed to a stub hanging out of his mouth, sat the
skipper up and said "Yore\' Stanley Steadman?!  Colonel Jonsen at yore
service!  Your going back to Ytherix/Redman.  Seems there are questions
surrounding the fate of your old boss that have to be answered... Oh.. and
banks get touchy about not getting paid for 32 months..." 

Stanley looked up at the chronometer on his cabin wall... time was now
15:57 local time.  

And so launched the carreers of the most notorious repo team in Redman
subsector history.  A total of 23 ships were repossesed over a period of 3
years. In the end, a gratefull bank rewarded Thul with a free and clear
title to the last ship he was to reposses... the Korondor Talisman.   "Now
if somebody would teach me to fly this damn thing!"

True. Marc did not know this when he named them (but I told him almost

Not necessarily. Could have been an English Lit Major.

And if they don\'t want to go to the trouble, they can watch Return of
the Jedi....cinematic (not scientific) proof that hordes of small, low
tech mammals armed with flint-tipped spears and a "Three Stooges"
approach to combat can defeat a technologically superior but

Your troops didn\'t break and run?  I would think that the morale checks
your men had to make every time they saw one of their stands burn up from
a plasma gun hit would take their toll.  You\'d have to roll a morale check
on most units every turn; they\'re more likely to break than to hit and
penetrate. 

That\'s how it turned out in a similar situation in one of my games when I
first got Striker.

Many thanks for the clarification (and another I received off

distinction.  Apparently neither (new) British dictionaries
or anyone I can find \'locally\' was aware of it either.  Just
goes to show how ignorant I can be at times!

So, I can ship 100 tons of Unobtanium from there to here for perhaps 100,000
credits (shipping cost of Cr1,000 per ton) plus the cost of buying the
material there. Free-lance shippers might be able to give a better rate;
corporate owned ships might do even better.

If I can get unobtanium locally for less than that price, no one is going to
ship it from there to here. On the other hand, if our local world (research
station with no local resources, or vacuum world with no agriculture) needs
something it can\'t produce locally, then we will see some commodity shipping,
won\'t we? It just depends on supply and demand.

My point was that the force ratio between TL is the facter, technolagy 
was the reason. 1 person with a TL15 Battle dress is still going to be 
overwealmed by 100,000 spear wealders. The TL15 would just kill a high 
proportion of the attacker , equivelent to a TL10 Company size unit.

Also, many high tech governments (take America) , but not all, would not 
be willing to take a smaller ratio of losses , than say an army in the 
Feudla Japan or Crusader period.

In my campaigns, I work it much like the Federal buildings in State Capitals.  
The Imperium has buildings and facilities that house the offices of the 
government employees that monitor Imperium matters (Trade, taxation, planetary

more than just a consulate or embassy.  I have several near the starports and a 
few in the capital.  This isn\'t canon but it is how I run my campaigns and it 
seems to work.

Well, working backwards:

WWII tech is more than up to producing "crunch guns" except that in the
real world, they are a lot lighter, and punch bigger holes in battle
dress. 

Civil War tech has gatling guns, which, given the incentive they
*could* improve in various ways. Also, the tech in the Monitor and in
the ill-fated Confederate submarine *are* combinable. And Civil War era
artillery isn\'t anything to sneeze at.

Sir Humphrey Davies developed several weapons (around 1815!) that even
the British Military decided were too terrible to use, and filed away
for major emergencies. Specificly, many of the poison gases used in WWI
were doable a century earlier. I don\'t have anything approaching a
complete list, but chlorine is obvious, and it is known that he
discovered mustard gas from when the sealed files were opened. Given
that Chloroform dates back that far, it is virtually certain that he
found phosgene as well (one of the tricks to producing chloroform is to
do so *without* producing phosgene!)

Late Renaisance artillery is fully capable of doing nasty things to
you. It was reasonable mobile, and powerful enough to eliminate castles
as a factor in warfare.

Also, using sappers and gunpowder charges goes *way* back. 

Greek fire can ruin your whole day.

Also something called a "fire pot" is nasty, and predates gunpowder. It
consists of a careful dug and reinforced hole, full of flammables. You
get the enemy to attack the position at the right time and it goes off
showering them with burning nastiness. Think of it as a one-shot
flamethrower suitable for barbequeing medium size infantry and tank
formations. 

Trebuchets are light, easy to conceal, relatively portable, *quiet*,
and medium sized ones are capable of throwing small cars several
hundred yards! Changing the bearing is a bitch, but since they can be
built to use very few expensive/important materials, building "one use"
units is not unreasonable. So you can send in a grav tank, only to have
a *big* rock smash it into the ground. 

The Roman repeating ballista might get improved if folks were desperate
enough. Its main shortcoming was that it didn\'t traverse, and was *too*
accurate, so after the first round, the advancing enemy, just opened a
gap in the ranks for the projectiles.

Besides rockslides, "primitive" natives can stampede *large* animals at
you. Pit traps are hard to detect. And the native hiding in the bushes
with a blowgun and poison darts is going to be both hard to detect, and
hard to defend against.

That last bit was the basis of a *wonderful* story in Analog in the
mid-60s. The high tech forces land to take possesion of a planet, and
start having people drop dead mysteriously on guard duty. They finally
leave suspecting everything from indetectable death rays to psionic
attackers. But it\'s just "primitives" with tiny slivers of bamboo and
some *strong* poison. :-)

The trick on that one is to not volunteer any ifo to the players, and
let them make lots of wrong guesses. :-)

Ah, but you aren\'t getting *just* the Unobtainium. You get things like
20 or 30 thousand tons of iron, silicon, titanium, plus lots of gold,
silver, platinum, etc.

Don\'t count on it. It takes a few megayears to go from "disturbed
nebula" to "planet stable enough to mine". That tends to thin out the
short lived isotopes. And they can\'t get too concentrated anyway, you
you get things a lot messier than the natural reactor in the Congo.

With fusion torch type gear, you get the "rare" stuff as either
byproducts from processing whatever rock was handy for more common
elements, or from processing stuff like wrecked equipment. 

It\'s definitely a lot easier and cheaper to vaporize and seperate the
ruined hull plates from a damaged starship than it is to mine lathanum
from any sort of ore using other techniques.

This is where the bit about *intelligent* opposition comes in. The
Spanish had an advantage in that the natives viewed them as gods (or
demons). Take that away, and the 30 would have died. They might have
inflicted great losses, but they would have died.

Slight problem here. Say they are in an area like the Balkans. The
Serbs will sneak into a Croat area to attack, and get the hell out of
there. That way it\'s the Croats who get nailed. This sort of thing
happens in real life. Heck, even the more "dedicated" guerilla types
will attack in areas they don\'t live so as to increase the number of
people with a reason to hate the invaders.

The other means of dealing with such things is to not *kill* any
invaders. Either you just wound them (which ties up more enemy troops
anyway) or you go in for various sorts of sabotage. 

Some of the more traditional sabotage tricks won\'t work well. Grav
vehicles won\'t need anywhere *near* the amount of lubricant that
wheeled and tracked vehicles do. So no adding the little packets that
make the engine sieze up hours later. 

Sabotaging fuel is harder too. Bbut I can think of a couple of
possibilities. A device that when slipped into an LH2 tank sits there
until the fuel level gets *way* down. Then it ignites a charge of the
material they use in things like "SolidOx" torches (basicly a solid
that releases an *enormous* amount of oxygen when ignited). Use the
Hydrogen to cool the gas so it can mix well (not that hard to set up).
Then, once the tank is full of the right mixture of oxygen and
hydrogen, supply a spark. The resulting blast should *easily* rival a
truck bomb. And it\'ll likely destroy or at least incapacitate even an
AFV.

A sneakier one, that depends on details as to *how* Traveller fusion
reactors work is to "spike" the fuel with something. For example, if
the reactors can actually "burn" regular hydrogen, with little
"enrichment" of deuterium/tritium, a good slug of D or T will result in
at least a small bang, or a thermal runaway in the reactor. Any
reaction that is running on mostly H1, or on just the small amounts of
H2 and trace amounts of H3 you\'ll find in normal hydrogen is not
goingto reaxct well when suddenly fed nearly pure deuterium, or a
deuterium/tritium mixture. It\'d be rather like putting Aviation
gasooline into a deisel engine. It won\'t explode, but it\'ll ruin the
engine, and may ruin part of the power train as well.

Sorry, but it *is* likely to be that empty. In this part of the galaxy,
the average seperation between stars is 5-6 light years. That\'s under 2
parsecs, but not by all that much. And being 3-d, this actually makes
stars *less* common than in Traveller.

Well, we can file off the serial numbers and re-use the plots in

Heck, we *know* that Clancy has some interest in wargaming. Maybe we
can get him interested in Traveller? I don\'t care whether he writes a
book, or an adventure. Either would be great. Tough I have to admit
that a Trav adventure written by Clancy might be just a hair hard to
survive for normal characters. :-)

You *don\'t* design tanks as huge enpty spaces unless they are one use,
and that use is under aceleration. "Sloshing" is a major problem in
large tanks, as significant amounts of mass can be shifting. So large
tanks have lots of baffles. And you need pumps, and possibly othe
measures, to deal with the situation when you have to restart the
engines after being in free fall.

I suspect you\'d have a greater chance of finding a single tonka toy on

In Canada we use Maple Leafs.  I\'ve got a friend in armor who could 
answer this correctly but he\'s in Japan till January.  We also have a 
rank called Master Corporal which I beleive uses two right way up "V" 
chevron\'s with a Maple Leaf.  He\'s the guy you don\'t mess with in the CF. 
 I think he\'s something like a Drill Sargent in the States.

        For the record, Gibson did actually get a few historical facts
straight.  There were indeed Scots named William Wallace and Robert the
Bruce, Edward I was indeed an expansionistic English king of that period,
the battles in the movie were named after actual historical ones, and
Wallace was in truth executed in an unpleasant manner.

        Aside from that, Braveheart is all Hollywood.  I can\'t believe he
won Best Picture for it.  Frankly, I think that Babe deserved it instead.

        Second or third thing I did after seeing Braveheart was go through
a biography of the Bruce and A Short History of Scotland.  I was really
steamed by the time I realized just how bad a job Gibson had done...

You missed one in the us one chevron is a Private, First Class (PFC) in the
Marines.

Just to continue the thread here is a list of US ranks for all forces.
I\'d like to see this extended for other countries.

Actually, finding a tonka toy wouldn\'t be all that hard.  I have 2 
sons.  There\'s a Tonka truck about 5 feet away...  :-)

This is more than just a flippant remark...  The whole key to 
searching for a derelict ship would be the same things it is in 
present day terms, but magnified...  You\'d need to do a lot of 
preliminary research to locate and pinpoint possible wreck sites, and 
have lots of time and money to do the search.  Remember that in present day 
terms, most sunken treasure searches, and indeed searches for any 
sort of wreck are ALMOST always unprofitable...and are usually 
unsuccessful.  Look at how long it took Ballard to locate the Titanic 
several years ago, and we knew almost precisely where it sank...  Unless 
the PC\'s have a good idea of where to look, this would probably be 
even more true in deep space...where the hiding places would be 
increased by several orders of magnitude...

OTOH, PC\'s stumbling upon wrecked ships is a plot device I\'ve used a 
few times, so...  maybe its more common in my games than it would be 
in reality...  :-P

I would think that the local bar, medical, and accounting associations
would administer tests and issue licenses.  Right -- what\'s the emoticon
for deadpan-delivery sarcasm? 

Bounty hunters are just people who make a living from the rewards offered
for the apprehension of people sought by the authorities.  They\'re not
licensed or regulated by anyone (and certainly not the Imperium, which
doesn\'t have enough interest in law enforcement to create another
regulatory structure). 

They may need weapons permits, which may require weapons training and
certification.  They may have day jobs, like private investigators or
assassins, that require licensing.  They may have to get a commission (in
the sense of a letter of marque) from the rewarding authority, depending
as all of the above examples do, on local law.  (I\'m thinking of the scene
in Rob Roy when Montrose directs Cunningham to arrest Rob Roy, and says,
"You have my commission on\'t!")

That\'s how I play them.  Bounty hunters exist today; maybe they have a
trade journal (or a web site) with useful information.

Here\'s the heart of the matter, so I haven\'t addressed your other points
(on which we\'re probably more in agreement than not).  I don\'t portray
every noble as a thief when running a game (remember, they\'re murderers,
too).  It\'s not realistic, for one thing, and it\'s too predictable, for
another.  I leave it to the Ine Givar to espouse radical notions like
getting rid of them all. 

I just don\'t have any illusions about the nobility of the noble class. 
There\'s nothing noble about violence and theft, no matter how many steps
removed from it one is.  Noble NPCs (or PCs, for that matter -- my players
can let their characters think anything that\'s in character) may even
believe their own lies.  Certainly billions of their subjects do.

>If Cleon is assumed to be a good man and a responsible ruler,  

Why would you make that assumption about 
- -a powerful industrialist, who 
- -controlled the Sylean Federation from behind the scenes;
- -embarked on a Machiavellian campaign lasting over thirty years to expand
the Federation beyond its capacity to retain control; 
- -in order to seize autocratic power?  

See Supplement 11, Library Data (N-Z), "Sylean Federation", at 23-24.  The
foregoing is my analysis and interpretation of the Library Data entry. 

Now, I have no doubt that he was competent, and that he had a grand (even
grandiose) vision that was eventually carried out, and he picked competent
people.  He may even have picked people who believed his rhetoric about
the need to grow or decay or whatever it may have been -- he probably did,
in fact. 

>>If you pick good people, the "felon who steals the common out from under
>>the goose" is going to be the exception to the rule, not the rule. 

In a time of expansion, the felons are out stealing the geese from the
neighbors\' commons and bringing them home; and killing the neighbors; and
selling their commons to the next wave of picked good people.  During such
a time, it is best to be firmly on the side of the picked good people.

Of course not -- you\'re picking known brigands to drive the outward
expansion, and when that stops, you\'re killing them off as best you can
before they turn on you.  That was Strephon\'s mistake -- he\'d forgotten to
be a sufficiently violent thief.  He should\'ve been reading The Prince
instead of The Gettysburg Address.

That\'s why your rapacious nobles must be directed outwards; having them
operating too close to home destabilizes society.  You\'re right, of
course, that nobles are smart enough not to push the governed too far. 
You can be very rapacious in your own backyard if you market it well
enough and/or provide enough distractions.

Are you sure that first colony ship to Oz wasn\'t filled with recent escapees

Oh, alright. I was once in a unit that used a cotton bale as it\'s D.I., went

That\'s easy to explain, you are clinging to the underside of the planet, so
of course you get confused about which way the chevrons are supposed to point.

Good to see you back on the list Michael.

Yes, and I used 3G3 to design some very nasty conventional missles for MT
Marines.  The Fusion Y gun was a directed weapon.  Nukes are nasty, dirty
and affect an area for decades.  You want to nuke a site?  do it from orbit.
You want to go in, level the Ine Givar base, and drag the cell leader out in
his pajamas?  Send a platoon of Marines.

Please note that I said I wouldn\'t trust a Marine Lieutenant with the Nukes.
His Battalion commander, on the other hand, is fully authorized to open up
the weapon stores.

Sending in ground troops, even in Battledress and fusion guns, means you
aren\'t just going for mass destruction, you have an objective.  Using nukes
is a clumsy excuse for real military skill.

I see there being some sort of consulate, from a prefab base at the side of
the landing strip at a class E starport to Lunion\'s Ducal Tower in downtown
Hirosta.  (based on 101 California for any San Franciscans out there)

The is, at minimum, a Consul whose job is to facilitate the smooth
communication between the Imperium, the local noble, and the planet
government.  The Consular staff also deals with questions such as visas,
Imperial Law, and any aid or assistance projects.

Larger consulates will have recruiting stations, large offices for most of
the Imperial Ministries, public areas with information terminals and small
exhibits.

Let me describe Lunion\'s Ducal Tower.  It is a large (78 story), triangular
skyscraper in the heart of Hirosta\'s financel district.  The building faces
onto a wide plaza with decrotive fountains and plants (some from off world).
If you stand in the center of the plaza, on the Sunburst done in red tile,
facing the building, this is what you see:  To your right is N-Space, a
popular resteraunt serving the building.  N-space rotates its fare to show
off the cooking styles of the various worlds of the subsector.  In the
evening, it is a popular place for "off the record" meetings with subsector
officals.

To your left is the lobby, a large glassed in area.  A small museum shows
off artifacts and crafts from the Lunion subsector.  At the door, two
Marines in Dress Uniforms and chromed Gauss Rifles stand guard.  Inside,
there is a large reception desk, with several civilan workers, as well as
another Marine.  The receptionists will be glad to direct you to the proper
office.

As you head for the elevator, you see a very large piece of hull metal
hanging from the ceiling, with burn scars and other damage.  Stopping to
read the plaque, you learn that this is a piece of the Sword World\'s
battleship Wotan, which was destroyed by a suicide squad of Lunion Army and
Marine volunteers during the 4th War...

You get the point..

The link to the Imperial government should be accesible, easy to use, and
able to do very little.  I suggest reading Keith Laumers Retief books for
the perfect example of how to run a red-tape machine.

	I was thinking about the problem of misjumping into an empty
parsec when a thought occured:  Could you not simply crawl into some low
berths, turn your radio up to maximum power with a distress beacon, and
wait it out?  Assuming you\'re anywhere near civilization, another ship
should enter the parsec sometime (e.g. a jump-1 ship making multiple jumps
to cross a 2-3 parsec gap).  After about a year and a half your signal
will have reached the far corners of the parsec, so anyone jumping into it
should pick it up.  I\'m making a number of assumptions here, of course,
and I\'m wondering how plausible they are: 

1. A low berth can run on minimal powerplant power and/or emergency
batteries for several years.  I\'m pretty sure this one is supported by
canon (after all, what fun are low berths if you can\'t find people from
previous decades/centuries in \'em? :-)
2. The powerplant will run that long (assuming you need it to maintain the
low berths) on the fuel it has.  I\'m thinking running the plant on "low"
and using a trickle of its usual output.
3. Your radio signal can be picked up across light-year distances.

	Another idea which follows from this:  Could you send a radio or
laser signal to a nearby system?  I\'ve heard that even a 200 MW laser from
earth could be picked up by alien civilizations many light years away
(it\'s sort of a do-it-yourself SETI idea someone came up with :-).  So
maybe you could tightbeam a message at someone?  Or would a broadcast
message be better? 

	Hey, here\'s a weird notion:  maybe part of the scout/navy\'s job
would be to look for distressed ships in empty space.  They\'d jump around
in say a 1 lightyear grid with very sensitive radio/EMS sensors looking
for signals from misjumpers.

  This kind of thing is vague enough in source literature you can
visualise your own idea of what Imperial government looks like and get
away with it.

  On "important" worlds (subsector capitals, etc) the center of government
would probably be a city\'s worth of Imperial buildings with the dukes
palace and estate somewhere in the middle.

  On lesser worlds, there would either be an Imperial facility at the
starport or a nobles estate. Remember, the Imperium is based on "noblesse
oblige" whoch means that Imperial business is done through a network of
nobility that has varying levels of responsibility.

  Lesser worlds would probably be represented directly by the nobility
while more important worlds would have large staffs.

   You\'re missing the point.

   Dealing with those kinds of situations isn\'t in the IM charter. The
Imperium deals with violations of Imperial law (eg, no nukes) _not_
local "disruptions". Planets are left, as they should be, to deal with
their own problems with a certain amount of leeway.

   Anytime Marines get involved, I\'ll bet it\'s more to "keep the edge"
(training) than to get seriously involved; also to provide some backbone
to local troops. In any case, in situations like that "the big stick"
would probably be left at home, and Marines would be wearing combat
environment suits and sporting guass rifles - not Battle Dress and FGMPs.

So these are staffed with bureacrats out of the local population, or are these 
transplanted Imperial citizens?  To what degree could a character depend on 
help if the locals are a little unruly/corrupt/out-to-get-them?

(I have images in my mind of the U.S. Embassy complete with Marine Guards.)

I was reading through T4 last night and was struck by the following passage
on Page 145:

"By Imperial reckoning, any race that invented the jump drive and therefore
achieved star travel on its own is termed a _major race_.  Consequentially,
any intelligent alien species that never developed that technology
independently is a _minor race_.  There are exactly seven major races; the
Vilani, then the Aslan, Hivers, K\'Kree, Solomani, Vargr, and the Zhodani."
(unusal wording reproduced exactly, _underscores_ indicate italic type in
T4)

It occured to me that something was missing, something has changed.  Where
are the Droyne?  The original major "six races" were: Humans (with it\'s
three branches), Aslan, Droyne, Hivers, K\'Kree, and Vargr.  It appears that
in T4 that the Droyne have been demoted almost into oblivion...  They only
get mention on Page 8 in the History of the universe section when the
narrative is talking about "Grandfather".  As a matter of fact the Droyne
don\'t even rate a mention as a minor race.  I dunno, I always liked the
little guys...

I\'m wondering what happened to the Droyne and why.  I think I can see a
possible reason why they may have been excluded from the Major Race moniker
with the passage also on page 145:

"Each major race holds dominion over a large volume of space rivaling that
occupied by any of the three Imperiums."

But by T4\'s definition, quoted earlier, the Droyne qualify as a major race
and perhaps, if Traveller Digest (the magazine) is still considered canon,
the Aslan don\'t...

Any thoughts?

Re the task system discussions, I\'ve been playing with a variant that
uses 1/2 the characteristic (round up) plus the skill as the target and
using 1D6 less for the task rolls.  I\'ve got some results on success
probabilities for various characteristic and skill levels that I
calculated on a new web page I put up.  Its at:

http://www.umr.edu/~mkm/trav/travpage.htm

I also posted the C code I used to figure the probabilies, plus a subset
which just calculates distributions for various numbers of dice.

I haven\'t looked at the multiple task resolution thing yet, so I don\'t
know if it\'ll work for that.  Any comments on the page or the task
system thing would be appreciated.

The terms major and minor races were created by the Vilani in order to
keep their prominence (originally, they were they only major race, and
the subjugated all the other races they came in contact with and thus
"lesser" races were born).  Of course, once the Vilani spread outward
enough, they ran into other major races.  8(

The Dryone, especially if they\'re uncast don\'t really seem to have that
zest for life that would make them cranky for being called a "major" or
"minor" race.

****Possible Spoiler****

The Aslan will be considered a major race until 1100 or so, when it\'s
revealed that they aren\'t!!!  (for those of you who don\'t know what I\'m
talking about, ignore me).

After that, it seems like no one really cares.  The toons have been
powerful for close to a milenia, and major/minor races aren\'t terms that
hold much meaning in the Third Imperium.

Bounty hunters are just people who make a living from the rewards offered
for the apprehension of people sought by the authorities.  They\'re not
licensed or regulated by anyone (and certainly not the Imperium, which
doesn\'t have enough interest in law enforcement to create another
regulatory structure). 

They may need weapons permits, which may require weapons training and
certification.  They may have day jobs, like private investigators or
assassins, that require licensing.  They may have to get a commission (in
the sense of a letter of marque) from the rewarding authority, depending
as all of the above examples do, on local law.  (I\'m thinking of the scene
in Rob Roy when Montrose directs Cunningham to arrest Rob Roy, and says,"You 
have my commission on\'t!")

Well, first you say they don\'t need any license, then you say they might get a 
commission (letter of marque) or in other words, a license to perform the 
activities of pursuit and apprehension of fugitives...   what is the 
difference?

As for the Imperium creating another regulatory structure, I am sure that the 
Duke might want to keep his ne\'er do well little brother occupied and out of 
the way, so he might say, "Clarence, I need a competent man whom I can trust 
for a highly important office.  Therefore, I am sending you to Lunion to head 
up a new agency, "The Bureau of Anti-Piracy and Deep Space Treason 
Prevention..."  or some such... <grin>

Sure you could, and a repeating radio locator beacon would not be hard to
rig.  And it would allow those "blade of grass" and "Needle in the haystack"
searches to work a bit better.

Also, if one misjumps into "empty" space, usually your ship has enough
Maneuver Fuel to make a significant fraction of Lightspeed before fuel runs
out (it doesn\'t take very long), pop everyone into low berths, and COAST
back to civ. 

Makes living near a rift an eternal archaeological find.

While I am waiting for the rest of the \'96 T4 releases to come out, I am 
continuing to use TNE (and FF&S) in a late Third Imperium setting.  I have TL15 
and a few TL16 worlds out there.  It stuck me that everyone has a great 
fascination with TL16 (because its so rare, I guess), and I was trying to come 
up with some TL16 goodies for the players.  However, TL16 does not seem to make 
a huge amount of difference, per the FF&S rules.

So, I decided that at TL16, you could have starships of less than 100 tons.  
The FF&S rules allowed such small starships at all tech levels, but I retained 
the 100-ton limit for consistency/continuity with CT.  However, with the 
inspiration of Fusion + and small craft at TL12+, this seemed fairly 
appropriate.

I realize this is very much "getting ahead" of the current Mileu 0 focus, but I 
suspect the new FF&S (whatever it will be called) will be covering the full 
range of Imperium Technology (TL5-15+).  I just wanted to post this suggestion 
while I was still thinking about it.

Any comments?

 This, of course, assumes that there is such a thing as a fusion
 torch extraction unit at the TL of the demand planet.  Fusion-
 based processes have a slight problem that I can see
 immediately - fusion creates _plasma_, which is lots and lots
 of stripped ions of all types, and then does interesting things
 to the plasma, like taking a good chunk of any available
 hydrogen ions, and converting them to one-fourth as many helium
 ions - or other combinations.  And what keeps the elemental
 gadolinium from recombining with the elemental oxygen?  What\'s
 the mechanism (even theoretically) for separating out the
 stuff? And how expensive is it going to be to run this fusion
 extraction process on that million tonnes of random rock?  Why
 won\'t it be cheaper to mine it from a planet two or three
 parsecs away, where it\'s as common as sand, and can be obtained
 in an easily refinable (with lo tech) form in relatively large
 quantities?

 Seems to me I recall that nuclear (fission) power would bring
 us to an era of nearly-free power forever.  Seems to me that if
 your scenario were accurate, everyone who had a few million
 bucks would be investing in the development of fusion power -
 or even in the preliminaries that would be needed, like
 superconductors, and supermagnets.  Seems to me that that\'s not
 happening.

 But the idea is to create a trade system that isn\'t excessively
 broken.

 Check your assumptions - remember that fusion is hot enough to
 vaporize just about anything we can think of - it is, after
 all, what\'s driving that big power plant that\'s 150,000,000 km
 off the New York coastline...

 The rationale for that was a combination of two factors -
 perceived value (pig iron doesn\'t have the perceived value of
 gem-quality diamonds, even if the latter are as common as
 sand), and expected lot size.  If you\'re doing goods trade in
 ground cars, and all of a sudden you realize that you\'re
 shipping plus ten million Td per year to the same planet,
 you\'ve probably moved into the commodity zone.

 Certainly - this kind of thing may well be what is involved in
 much of the commodity and goods trade, or in outright freight.
 While I couldn\'t have put it as well as you, this was what was

 Well, yes, that\'s probably true - but (and I apologize for not
 emphasizing this earlier) I was thinking more in terms of what
 has historically (in Traveller) been called "speculative" trade
 - where the guy doing the shipping buys the goods at one end,
 and sells them at the other end.  On the mains, this may not be
 a big part of trade, and [my classifications of] commodities
 and some goods will probably be handled as "freight", at
 standard rates.  But on the frontier, and in the Deeps, spec
 trade would probably be the rule, at least until someone
 realizes "Hey, the _Edmund_Fitzgerald_ has been making a mint
 lately; let\'s see if we can get a piece of that," at which
 point volume starts going up, and prices start coming down.

One reason to list the Vilani, Solomani and Zhodani separately; the Solomani 
Hypothesis has yet to be proven in the Year 0, so everybody is a separate 
species (disregard that interbreeding!).  As for where the winged ones are; I 
don\'t know.  Maybe the Droyne (as opposed to the Chirpers) are yet to be 
discovered in Year 0?

Interesting.  Even though Traveller did it first, you have to avoid being 
associated with more recent material.  Yeesh.

of the Solomani ship Pathfinder which crashed on Kyusu, was covered up by two
major clans from a third, and a hidden fact for over 3000 years. The reason was
that it would hurt Aslan honor to be called a minor race in the grand scheme of
things. The two clans believed that a third clan was developing it due to them
having research facilities away from major stellar bodies, but, was only
developing living conditions for space habitates. They only learned of the
existance from the wreck, the few survivors, and the work of Aslan females.
(thank god for women!) The Aslani HAD developed spaceflight, but not starflight.
They were only TL 8 at the time....
	The fact (and the dishonor) was only \'leaked\' in 1109 to a group who was

  If I go thru the trouble of using a stageing base, it is because I
think the system is defended.
  So.. Very big fleet.. all available warships within logistics capibilities.
  I \'jump\' on defended systems in overwhelming force to,
    a: Ensure victory.
    b: Get that victory in as short a time as possiable.
    c: Crush the enemy (the ships you destroy today, while you have advantage,
       you do not have to fight tomorrow during the counter-attack).
    d: Lower my own loses.
  But the reasons of how and / or why to mass a BIG fleet digress from
the discussion.  Let us just say I\'m power mad and leave it there.

   I would have thought 250 meters to 2.5 kilometers \'core\'.
   Still, as you point out, that is a lot of hydrogen.
   Sorry, well... not really, but ya\' caught me ;-]

   And they are hard to spot also.   No Infra-Red sig to speak of.
   The hydrogen slush and other wierd chemicals that form by 
gasious deposit covering the solid core would act as \'radar\' or
\'EMS\' absorbent stealth covering.
  Gigantic targets with EMM covering, coasting, equates to
a minus 3 diff mod (FF+S rules), a good chance to get a target
detection at 13 light-seconds, (128 hexes FF+S rules)
using a strenght 16 sensor.   The rules do not cover when
something is first picked up on sensors as a blip, so how
about 4 times the rated range.  This would give comet detecting
range at a little under a light-minite.  Vice the couple of 
light-hours you were probially thinking of.
  So.. It gets down to how dense do you think there are cometary
bodies in deep space (vice the Comet Cloud).   One per cubic light-
hour, or one per cubic light day.   I lean towards the light-day
end of the scales.

Actually, the original suggestion is far better than accelerating to
near c (even if possible without trashin the ship on a dust grain).

As was suggested, it doesn\'t put you more than a few parsecs from
another world in most cases, right?  So it takes 6.5 years to get to
a world 2 parsecs away (the distress call), then help arrives in a
week, you\'re home in another week.  If you accelerate to near c, it
still takes around 6.5 years, but now you\'re moving near c, so any
rescue attempt must also match your velocity!  Months at a few gs.,
then months to slow down, thn a week in jump.  If you accelerate to
midpoint, then slow down, the trip will take longer than the 6.5
years plus 2 weeks anyway.

Send an SOS, then take a nap is the best way to go.

  I recently came across the existance of this list, and decided to try to
and join it.  I suspect that I will be "lurking" for a time before
becoming a contributing list member...

  What has caused me to join this list is my enjoyment of Traveller from
my college days in 1978.  I originally gave up on the game system
(traveller classic or TC) due to it\'s inelegant handling as time went on.
I later came across Megatraveller, but saw too many problems with the
system as well (ie bad rules writing etc...) and failed to use that
system.  When Traveller the New Era came out, I enjoyed it for a time, but
the gaming group I was with didn\'t like the combat system used by GDW\'s
TNE.  Now, Traveller the 4th edition is out, and it seems to have improved
somewhat to the point that I can enjoy it again.
  Having said that, I am disappointed that there were as many typos and
lackluster pasteup work in the Fourth edition, first printing  copy of
Traveller by Imperium Games.  However, the potential is there, I fully
expect to support Imperium Games with my hard earned dollars <grin>.  What
I am asking is, can anyone tell me what experience they have had with the
ship to ship combat rules unveiled at Gencon?  What threads of discussion
has there been regarding T4 (so that I might look for them in the
digests)?  Has anyone heard anything about how to convert the weapon stats
from CT to T4?  Will we (the Traveller public) be able to use the
MEGATRAVELLER stuff, the STRIKER rules for creating equipment, the FF&S
stuff for equipment in the T4 environment?
  Also, has anyone written alternative rules for economics regarding the
fixed prices for interstellar travel (ie 1,000 cr per ton of cargo, 10,000
cr for high passage, etc)?  Has anyone explored the idea of making the
price guide based not only upon revenue producing volume on the ship, but
also upon distance travelled, and/or time taken to travel?  I ask this
because I took the time to "solo" play merchants using jump 1, then jump
2, and so on, ships to see if they were economically feasible - then
discovered that they were not feasible past jump 1...
  Well, I have unloaded enough on this list.  Any help from anyone on this
list would be appreciated.  If anyone knows of the existance of an
official published listing for the TROJAN REACH sector just "south" of the
SPINWARD MARCHES, and north of the RIFTSPAN REACHES, I would also
appreciate it.  I will be running my first Traveller campaign in almost 10
years this Saturday, with the players attempting to plant a colony in the
section of space between Aslan territory, and the Imperial Territory in
TROJAN REACH - with a Mr. Burke like corporate manager (from Aliens if
you remember the sleeze <grin>) attempting to advance in the corporation,
but at the expense of the players and NPC colonists...

I added the official rank abbreviations because no-one ever spells out the

different for each branch of the service, including the fact that Army rank 
abbreviations must be in all capitals, unlike other branches.

>The specialist grades 5-9 were eliminated in 1985.

Yeah, I joined that year and I got to see a few in Fort Jackson before they 
made the change.  Slang for Spec 4 is "Private E-4."  That pretty much sums 
up what it feels like to be one.  In \'88 there were rumors that Spec 4 would 
dissappear too, but it never happened.  I got CPL from holding a SGT 
position for the required length of time.  Hard stripes sure look better 
than that goofy shield-thing they use for SP4 insignia.

If you\'re interested, I could dig up the Japanese Self-Defense Force rank 
tables.

like to receive them, but please send them to my email address directly.

Ok, I\'ll accept this as a possible explanation for this omission as it
appears for the time being that the main T4 Timeline will be presented from
"year 0" viewpoint...  And that it is possible that for people within that
given time frame, early within the 3rd Imperium, may not have made the
connection between Ancient and Droyne races.  Additionally, I\'ll accept
that in this timeframe that the Aslan would still be considered a Major
Race by the this viewpoint.

>Previous canon suggested that xenoarchaeologists DURING the 3rd

I\'ll accept that previous canon...  That the connection between Ancient,
Droyne, and Chirper races were discovered in the time frame that the
Chirper\'s were introduced within the rules (circa Adventure 2 - Research
Station Gamma) which would put it in late 1106 or early 1107, if my memory
isn\'t totally shot.

If my memory hasn\'t left me, I believe that the Chirpers were introduced
_before_ the Droyne (and after the Ancients) in any case.  I seem to
remember that the term "Six Races" (as well as the first _grand scale_ map
of the Imperium) first appeared, interestingly enough, in an early issue of
"Different Worlds" magazine (Issue 9 if memory serves).

HOWEVER, the connection between Ancients and Droyne _is_ made _within_ the
T4 rules book on Page 8 in the history of the universe section when it
discusses the Ancients and that they were Droyne.  After that fleeting
reference the Droyne are not mentioned at all, not as a Major or Minor
Race.  I kinda feel that they have been short changed in a way, as I always
thought them to be an interesting race.  More alien than the Vargr, Aslan,
and perhaps even the K\'Kree.  Pastoral, but one gene mutation from
achieving Grandfather prowess once again.

I\'m would not be at all suprised if they were intentionally left out of the
narrative.  And if it was intentional that Marc & Co. have a perfectly good
reason to do so, and will reveal these reasons in due course.

However, I for one hope that the Droyne have a place and a role in T4.

P.S.  At least I\'m not sticking up for the Primordials!!!

True enough. It\'s just that large shipments of "raw materials" will be
unlikely. The values of just about anything is going to be more
dependent on the "structure" given it than on the cost of the materials.

And a lot of things are likely to be the result of telling a
fabrication unit (faber) "Here are some specs. Make me some of the
item". At TLs below 16 these probably are *big* units, so they\'d
correspond to a factory. So "some" will be thousands or even millions.

At higher tech levels the size will come down unit you can carry the
unit. At that point society gets *really* weird. Players who find such
a unit (maybe Grandfather forgot it? :-) will have something along the

maintenance. :-)

That could get real inconvenient if they\'d been depending on it. You
need *at least* three such units to be able to depend on them. That way
if one breaks, you take the part from one working unit and copy it in
the other working unit. With stored specs, you can get by with two. 

But I digress...

Check your history. There have been a number of times when highly
displined infantry was *necessary*, as the only way to survive was to
absorb some nasty causalties to get close enough to the "super weapon"
of the time. Troops that broke died to a man. 

Old example. A pike square that breaks while cavalry around is *dead*.
So the the experienced (or well trained) troops would absorb a lot of
losses from the occasional artillery piece, and from manuevers like the
caracole, simply because the alternative was for *all* of then to die.

That\'s why training, morale, and espirit d\'corps are so important. They
make the difference between an arny that holds and a mob that breaks.

First things first. All the Army ranks that have specialist are
actually two *seperate* ranking tables. That is, it goes like this for
rank: 

Grade   Normal			Specialist
E1      Private
E2      Private
E3      Private 1st Class
E4      Corporal		Specialist 4
E5      Sergeant		Specialist 5
E6      Staff Sergeant		Specialist 6
E7      Sergeant 1st Class	Specialist 7
E8      1st / Master Sergeant	Specialist 8
E9      Sergeant Major		Specialist 9

The "specialist" ranks are a way to reward increased skill in technical
areas *without* putting the specialists in the "chain of command". 

Marine E9s are "Master Gunnery Sergeants".

Suggestion for IG. check out the several books in this field and if
there\'s a standout, see if you can cut a deal with the pulisher and
either carry it in your catalog, or get it offered to game shops.

Ok, it works like this. At plasma temperatures, you can use electric
and magnetic fields to sort ions by charge/mass ratio. Sort of an
overgrown mass spectrograph. (And yes, this setup *will* seperate
isotopes at the same time it seperates elements!)

This was one of the three techniques used for isotope seperation at Oak
Ridge during the Manhattan Project. All three worked.

You do *not* attempt to raise the *pressure* to the levels required for
fusion, there\'s no need. This makes field control easier. You actually
want the *temperature* at the point where the seperation starts to be
higher than most fusion reactors would use, but this is not a problem
as you don\'t need fusion pressure levels. You want the high temp
because there is a temp (not all *that* unreasonable) at which no
molecular bonds can form. So you don\'t have to worry about the ions
combining.

The main expense is power, which is pretty cheap what with fusion+. 

These units will likely start out as ways of disposing of toxic wastes,
and re-refining nuclear waste, and various materials that are a pain to
deal with otherwise. But once you have them, it\'ll rapidly become
obvious that while ore does give a higher yield, you can operate them
to produce something *common* (like silicon or aluminum) at a
"breakeven" cost, and then have all the "trace impurities" in whatever
you feed thru be pure profit.

Note that there are several metals that are *solely* produced in an
analogous manner. That is, the cheapest way to produce them is from the
"waste stream" of plants refining something else!

You over-estimate the foresight of investors. Especially ones with MBA

What assumptions? After you have the elements in *seperate* plasma
streams, you want to cool them anyway (and recover a fair chunk of the
energy that went into heating them in the process). Pretty soon you
have the plasma streams down to temperatures in the range used by
"plasmas sprayers", which means you can aim a stream of silicon ions
and a stream of oxygen ions at the same point and let them combine into
silicon dioxide. You can deposit it slowly, for some purposes that want
high quality crystals, or *fast* for applications that just want high
purity quartz glass. For the latter, you can deposit it at speeds that
would almost make someone think you were *pouring* it. This part is
*current* tech, it\'s just not used for everyday purposes.

The alternative is to look to some folks like anpother TSR, using

It\'s this one that\'ll kill you. See below.

Well, to start with, a 200 MW laser is  not exactly an an off the shelf
item right now, and when it is, it\'ll be considered a *weapon*, not a
comm unit. Modulating it is going to be kinda difficult.

For radio, the problem is the inverse square law. A radio designed to
be strong enough to pick up on normal receivers at 1 AU (150 million km
or 93 million miles) is going to have a signal strength 43 *billion*
times weaker at 1 parsec. To put it another way, a 1 MW transmitter
will have a signal strength of 4e-18 W/m^2 at 1 AU. At 1 parsec it\'d be
8e-29 W/m^2. You\'d get a stronger signal from one of those 500
milliwatt toy walkie-talkies on *pluto*. 

Sure, the signal is theoretically capable of being picked up. But
that\'s with things like the Arecibo dish, which is a km or two across!

Broadcast signals aren\'t going to work. So you need *beamed* signals.
Which means being able to aim them accurately enough *and* pump enough
power into them to be noticed. 

The power is what kills you this time. If you have enough fuel to put
out the signal for the several years it\'d take, you have enough for a
jump!

software is there right now, until I get things working, then I will upload
another 7-8 programs.

I placed the software in the same directory as all my other Traveller

tried using the tag:

Sure, but it\'s ironic the way it turned out.  Go to all that effort to 
create a alien race, then you have to change their appearance because 
someone comes along /after/ you and uses a similar appearance for their 
alien.

I\'d rather see the Aslan look like _Traveller_ Aslan.  If this Wing Commander
(whatever it is) copied the style, why should IG change just to suit them? 
Remembering that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, I\'d vote for
the traditional Traveller Aslan.

Knowing that at least one of the Traveller team listens to Stan Rogers music,
remember his comments on "Barrett\'s Privateers").

For those of you who don\'t know Stan Rogers, he was a Canadian folk
singer/songwriter.  He wrote a song called "Barrett\'s Privateers", which was
so popular and widely sung that it was often attributed as "trad." in the
credits.  He was both flattered that he had written such a popular song and
annoyed that a lot of people who liked it didn\'t know he wrote it.

This is true but has already been addressed in an earlier posting, so I
won\'t go over the problems with laser/radio beacons here.

This is true only if you\'re using Newtonian physics, which work at low speeds.
In reality, you have to consider Einsteinian physics.  I\'m no expert but I
do know that, for a given speed v, the amount of energy needed to get to
the next speed increment v1 is a factor of the mass of the ship and the original
speed v.  

It is well known that the mass of an object increases as its speed increases.
I doubt very much whether a 6G maneuver drive, for example, could get anywhere
near light speed before running out of fuel.

If you like, I can dig up the appropriate formulae to show.

	The previously published Traveller material on the Droyne states 
that it wasn\'t until the Imperium was going for a while that the records 
got put together well enough to reconize that the Droyne (who did not 
maintain intersteller travel) were actually ONE species.  If I recall 
correctly, this was in about 500 IMP (?).  So, for T4 purposes, the 
Droyne are a low tech minor race (at least for Milleau 0).

	10% of ship & cargo, is typical from Loyds. Normaly this

even with grav focusing.  That or use a maser commo device.  The
laser weapn would be better, though.  Actually, this might be a good
arguement for tunable lasers (assuming we don\'t redo the atmospheric
attenuation rules which favor x-ray lasers).  A tunable laser weapon
could be used in a FM mode for commo in emergencies.

First you\'d spend some time figuring out where you are.  Then you\'d
beam a laser signal (weapon, preferably) to the nearest *world* with
commo (your computer will have to adjust for the flight time of the
messege, and maybe raster the signal around a little).  Have it do
this automatically for a period of time equal to the world distance
(in ly), maybe once a day of dso after an inital burst (to conserve
power).  After this period of rebroadcast, the first signal should
arrive, so while you wait, broadcast on non beamed commo for them to
find you when they jump nearby (do this a little early so wherever
they jump in, they\'ll get the distress call.

Then hope the rescuers aren\'t pirates!  Neat hook.  Ship misjumps.
They send a messege, then take a nap for a few years.  Computer
wakes them up (it was told to do so) when they detect a ship on the
passive sensors.  Great, they found us!  How long til they get here
(HEPlaR and or weeny t-plates way out here)?  A few hours.  Great.  How
come they haven\'t sent a signal to us yet?  Drop hints that this
isn\'t the normal naval rescue service... maybe it\'s just a trader,
maybe a pirate.

Generally speaking is not a Misjump a catastrophic event.  Something 
major has to happen to cause a starship to end up in the middle of the 
big black, it\'s not an everyday event.  And as such it seems possible 
that there would be major damage to the ships electrical systems in the 
process.  Combined with the fact that during the early days of the 
Imperium as well as the later days of the Imperium that you never really 
knew who was going to pick up that distress signal.  Sure the good guys 
may rescue you but what if they don\'t...

Accellerating your ship might be possible with HEPlaR but with 
Grav-Thrusters you\'re on a constant course to no where plus if you\'ve got 
low berths and you\'re message states, have laid in a course for ? expect 
to be there in 10 years what\'s the point of sending out a rescue mission, 
it\'s costly and they\'re going to show up in the end.  With a tight beam 
transmission such as a maser or laser you\'re hopping the planet is where 
you think it is when your transmission gets there other wise no one is 
the wiser,  plus with a tight beam transmission it\'s impossible to get a 
co-ortinate fix of the orgin point, you simple know it\'s along that line.

I\'d imagine a starship disappearing into the black would be like a small 
aircraft going down in the interior of BC with no flight plan.  Even when 
they\'ve got a flight plan they sometimes never find those planes.  Often 
it\'s a hunter who stumbles across the wreckage 5 years later.  Before 
everyone says you\'ve got a crappy search and rescue program out there 
take a look at BC, Two very large mountian ranges and a lot of temperate 
rain forest, the trees just sort of pop back into place once the plane 
has passed through them.  If the ELT isn\'t working properly or the plane 
is upside down you\'ll never find it.

Yep.  Some servers don\'t know how to serve up an FTP link.  Also those that
do have different paths to their FTP site than their HTTP documents.
Depends on how the SysAdm set up the WWW server and the anonymous FTP
service on the server.   

My workaround would be to use the HTTP:/path/to/my/file.ext structure and
let the browser worry about what to do with the file.  Most browsers (if not
all) will prompt the user and ask what to do with the file that is not an
actual page.  The catch here is if you try and make .txt files available,
the browsers will attempt to display them.

        My solution to this is to try to write some adventures that could be

The General Staffs foresaw a SHORT war, the argument being that economic disruption 
would bring any general war to a halt rapidly. That was the politician\'s view; the 
military view (Joffre, Foch and Moltke) differed. See Truchman\'s _The Guns of August_ 
for a more-detailed discussion.

_Panzer Leader_ -- memoir and game both -- are excellent. You also forget Erwin Rommel\'s 
_Infantry Attacks!_. Keep in mind that armies that lose wars _change things_ if they 
still exist, and the 100,000 man Army of the interwar years took a long, hard look at 
_why_ they lost and _changed things_. For another citation of this, look at how the US 
Army changed after Vietnam.

Can you say "NKVD"? In WW2 the Red Army gave troops the choice of certain death at the 
hands of their officers or second-echelon motivation brigades if they flee OR a 
possibility of surviving if they hold. I\'d bet on the historical result.

I prefer the \'traditional\' portrayal of the Aslan, but I can relate to the legal 
argument for changing it. Perhaps the game-world explanation for the change might be 
some kind of pan-Aslan social movement or some such.

I don\'t remember the comments on "Barret\'s Privateers," but I know the song:

Oh, the year was 1778
(how I wish I were in <brain misfire/fart> now!)
A Letter of Marque came from the King
To the Scummiest Vessel I\'ve ever seen

	God damn them all! I was told

	We\'d fire no guns, shed no tears . . . .
	Now I\'m a legless man on a Halifax pier
	The last of Barret\'s Privateers!

My mind is not in music mode now . . . ;)

I\'m pretty sure its "broken" anyway, you find out how in the last verse.
The site of the hypothetical pier is visible from my office window.

The song has a good beat, can actually be sung by untrained mail chorus with
beer accompanyment and cries for use as an adventure tie in

"We cruise the rift
    for Syle-e-an gold"
"Fire no beams, shed no tears"
"Now I\'m a broken Varge on an imperium pier..."

Sad thought "he was so good no one knew he was Canadian" :-(  He was from
Ontario, but his father\'s people (I think) were from Nova Scotia.  I
dicovered his music in the 80\'s, after he died in an airliner fire in the
US.  Annoys me the he was giving concerts in the 70\'s not a kilometer from
where I was at University, and I didn\'t have the sense to go see him.

I think his song was meant to be reflective of an anti war sentiment rather
than historical, since our privateers were almost uniformly successful :-)

I was thinking about this Droyne thing and I don\'t knowif the fact that they
were not considered a major race has much to do with it.  I mean, IG
included the 6 parsec Jump Drive in the book and it is definitely not
present in the year 0.  If the Droyne were left out because of the year 0
thing, then J-6 should have been left out too (not to mention J-5 and J-4).

Well, the good news is that the picture is no longer on IG\'s page.  Maybe we
had an impact on them again.  It\'s nice to be able to think that they might

	I think the game-relevant difference between "luxury" and other
goods is the ease of buying and selling them.  Pig iron likely is traded
on exchanges where buying and selling at the up-to-the-moment market price
is as easy as calling a broker.  Gem stones, perfumes, art, delicacies,
and other rare off-world goods will not have this sort of set-up which
means that dealing in these goods will be much more difficult (gives the 
Purser/Bursar something to do).

	And commodities traded in this volume are extremely unlikely to 
be shipped through free traders.  For example, if you\'re a car 
manufacturer on a world with a few billion pop and you\'re shipping ten 
million Td of cars per year to the neighboring world of a few 100s of 
millions pop, you\'re not going to wait for unpredictable free traders to 
show up to ship your cars a few at a time.  You\'ll have a regular 
contract with a shipping company that has regularly scheduled service 
between the two worlds.  That\'s not to say that in unusual circumstances 
a Free Trader might not be used, like labor unrest, or just a big surge 
in demand.
	I\'ve got a shipping system worked out that would serve this sort 
of situation well.  I\'ll try to write it up and post it in the next couple 
of days.

	You\'re right, shipping freight is pretty boring game-wise and, in
any case, spec trade will be the rule in the Deeps.

	Actually, its not really desirable to keep this "profiteering" in 
check since it is the large profits being made on shipping that will draw 
more investment into building and operating ships.  Since there are big 
gains for everyone to be made in interstellar trade, it is socially 
desirable that there be more investment in shipping.  Hence, eliminating 
the large profits in this area would be a bad thing.  If you\'ve ever 
lived in a rent-controlled city, you know what I mean.
	The part about the amount of trade being reduced isn\'t really 
true since all ships should be running with their holds full. The real 
limit on trade is the number of ships available.  This will only get 
better when people invest in building more ships.

 >And at what point to the large corps come in, and
 >what about the nascent megacorps after them?

	The corps will come in after the free traders have sniffed around 
with their spec trading and discovered which goods and which routes are 
money-makers.
	In terms of modelling this in game terms, the simplest way would 
be to have price modifiers which would bring prices on 
different planets closer together depending on location.  There could be 
three levels: Core, Frontier, Deeps.  Price differences in the Deeps 
would be at their fullest extent while price differences in the Core 
would be greatly reduced in Year 0 to non-existent in later centuries.
	For a merchant prince campaign, a more complex system could be 
used where the ref figured out likely trade routes and assigned shipping 
to them.  Using a price deflator for competition (yet to be created), he 
could then figure out the market price along those routes.

 >the GM should realize that the route is being exploited already, and ref 
 >the spec trade process accordingly - which means that there may be _no_ 
 >cargos of the specified type available at a price that the PCs can live 
 >with.

	I always thought the "cargo availability" stuff was a bit awkward. 
If I land on an industrial world of a 100 million people, shouldn\'t I be
able to find just about any industrial good I want?  If there are people
out there who want to buy things but can\'t because of shortages, you\'ve
got a pretty inefficient economy.  On really small or low-tech worlds the
system makes a bit more sense, but not many worlds are _that_ small.  
	I think my price mod system handles the situation pretty 
accurately and simply.  For more detailed "merchant prince" campaigns, 
additional roles and role-playing can be involved in finding precisely 
the type of good at precisely the price the players want.  
	A good merchant campaign should allow players to notice that
there\'s a big overcapacity in holographic memories on Planet A, while
Planet B 3 parsecs over is experiencing an economic boom and prices there
are much higher. This is the sort of thing that being a Free Trader and 
opening new trade routes is all about.  It shouldn\'t just be a matter of 
comparing UWPs, IMHO.  An ex-Scout who used to do economic surveys would 
make an excellent Free Trader.

I assume that \'at least one of the Traveller team listens to Stan Rodgers\'
is because of the reference to the Mary Ellen Carter in TNE material (Star
Vikings pages 47 and 51).  Am I correct?  Does the reference to the Mery
Ellen Carter have any special meaning (besides that obvious from the words
of the song and the motto on the ships patch - \'That her name not be lost to

Lentuli subsector appears to be Empty Quarter (I), based on the information in
the DGP sector files and the article on the Newts from Marhaban/Lentuli, 
which looks like it\'s Empty Quarter 0426:

Marhaban      0426 A4697AB-E                       801 Im K8 IV

There is a second Marhaban in the Lishun sector, but as I recall it didn\'t
have a satisfactory UWP and failed to match the article description for the
location ("trailing and coreward of capital", BJTAS #3, 15.)  The discussion
in the HIWG list was that Marhaban was perhaps a Vilani name for the world.

As I recall, EQ was one of the sectors that appeared to need some UWP review
due to bad generation, but the star locations should all be as in _Atlas_.

Loren, I\'ll send you a stack of related files directly.

Thing is, such "stealthing" as they have is purely accidental. They
aren\'t all that absorbent on all wavelengths. You just pick a "good"
one (millimeter band, maybe?) and fire off some *strong* pulses. For
setups like this, where you don\'t need to manuever, you can deploy some
pretty *huge* antennas.

For that matter, if you jump in a light year or so out, you can use a
nuclear pumped radar like the one proposed as part of the "Spacewatch"
proposal. That\'ll detect anything more than a meter across within
several light hours. Sure, it\'ll let the enemy know, but by then the
attack will be over. :-)

Heck, there are even *legitimate* reasons for someone to be doing that.
Some Belter types would likely do that sort of thing (closer in)
looking for bodies that are worth deflecting into the inner system as
cheap sources of volatiles and organics. Or even just worth exploiting
"in place".

In which case we wouldn\'t see very many comets. Density is almost
certain to be more like one per cubic AU!

"Tight beam" is relative. From a parsec away, the beam will cover the
entire system. Remember, the *definition* of parsec is that 1 AU
subtends only one second of arc at a parsec. And since a 1 arc-second
beam divergence isn\'t possible due to diffraction limits, the beam will
easily cover everything.

And directional fixes are somewhat possible on such a beam. They are
just somewhat limited by the small angle differences between different
observers.

Hey, here in Oregon it hasn\'t been that long since a plane was
*accidentally* discovered (by a fire crew?) right in the middle of the
area where everyone had been searching for it. It\'d gone down in a
steep dive and wound up *between* some trees.

And a few years back, they found a plane (somewhere in the northwest)
that had disappeared 40 years ago!

The age old problem of referee\'s, DM\'s, et al for as long as the hobby has been around.  
The answers - 1) be well prepared in advance, and 2) be able to think fast on your feet 
(or in your chair).  

If you are running a campaign, I suggest not using prepared adventures unless your 
players don\'t mind having that pre-determination feeling.  By that I mean the players 
could very well get the feeling they are stuck in a storyline with little choice in what 
happens - unless you, the Ref, are willing to follow numbers 1 & 2 above.  In which case 
you can put enough of your own campaign ideas into said adventure to make the players 
feel their characters have some say in their future.

Currently, I am running a "Glory Years" Traveller campaign, set in the early 1100\'s.  
I\'ve been bringing together all the early adventures I have and customizing them to fit 
the style of this particular group of players.  Are you familiar with CT?  If so, pull 
out that old copy of 76 patrons!  It\'s full of great adventure leads.  Each parton 
encounter is written in a style that leaves plenty of room for Refs to breathe life life 
into them.  Maybe if we ask real nice IG will publish a new version....

Happy Gaming,

No, I said they were *designed* as a weapon. The requirements aare

Again, do you have *any* idea of the difference between being "tunable"
and being able to frequency modulate?

The beam can\'t be focused anywhere *near* well enough to hit *just* a
world at those distances. Probably not well enough to hit *just* the
inner system!

There are three kinds of modulation: Pulse, amplitude, and frequency.

Pulse modulation (PM) switches the signal on and off. It may be simple
and crude like Morse code, or it may be more complex. It generally
breaks down into PWM and PCM. PWM uses the *width* of the pulse as the
signalling element. PCM (pulse code modulation) uses fixed width pulses
and fixed inter-pulse intervals. The info is the presence or absence of
pulses.

Amplitude modulation (AM) uses a modulator to vary the power level
(amplitude) of a signal according to the input signal.

Frequency modulation (FM) uses a different sort of modulator to vary
the *frequency* of the signal.

Now let\'s look at laser weapons. They fall into two classes. Pulse
lasers, which produce a fixed (very short) length pulse, and continuous
lasers which produce a beam for as long as you feed power (more or less).

Pulse lasers have a maximum pulse rate that is usually *quite* large in
comparison to the pulse length. This is due to engineering concerns.
Mostly heat problems. In any case, PWM is out, as trying to change the
pulse width would require redesigning the system from scratch. PCM
won\'t work well as the typical pulse widths are milliseconds or less,
and the inter-pulse interval is *seconds* or more. Just *detecting* the
pulses would be very hard. timing them would be a *real* problem. And
both AM and FM verquire a continuous carrier. So pulse lasers are out.

With continuous lasers, we have to consider the following factors. Rise
time is how fast the power can go from off to on, without damaging
anything. Fall time is how fast it can go from on to off, again without
damaging anything. Those control any sort of PM we might try.

AM gets messier. The main problem is that you need a modulator. That
is, something capable of varying the level of the power the laser is
outputting according to a much weaker signal being fed into it. This
requires rather large and specialized equipment. Worse, it requires the
device whose output is being modulate to be *designed* to accept
partial output levels, something that is just *not* going to be done
with a weapon (it makes the design a *lot* more complex and subject  to
failure). So not only is a ship unlikely to have a suitable AM
modulator, even if one is kludged together, the odds are that the laser
can\'t be run at arbitrary power levels.

FM requires no merely a tunable laser, but one that can be tuned while
operating, rather than between shots. The rate at which the frequency
can be changed is the critical factor here. And again, it\'s unlikely to
be suitable for signalling purposes.

I\'d say that the only remotely workable possibiliity is using a
continous beam laser in some sort of pulse modulation. As long as the
laser allows "short" pulses (say between .1 sec and 10 sec) *and* it
allows such pulse for extended periods, we have a chance.

Unfortunately, that range may not be one that weapons designers see
much point in supporting. If you are using .1 sec pulses, why not use a
pulse laser? It\'d be easier on the unit, and allow higher power levels.
At 10 seconds, we are getting into a range were one may be trying to
"scan" a laser across potential posistions of targets. At least there\'s
a good chance that the fire control system can be programmed for pulse
patterns. 

But it makes for *slow* messages. Morse code rules:

dashes are 3 dots long
space between elements of a letter is one dot long
Space between letters is one dash long

Plus the wait between "words", which I can\'t recall right now. Lets
call that 3 dashes (9 dots)

That makes SOS 36 dots long, counting the space between repeats:
|. . .   ... ... ...   . . .         |

At 10 seconds per pulse, that\'s 6 minutes.

I quote from "University Astronomy", by Pasachoff and Kutner (Saunders, 1978)
page 695:

The energy of a moving particle is given by:

	E = (m0)c**2[1 - (v/c)**2]**(-0.5)
             
(** = to the power of)

where m0 is the mass of the particle when it is at rest,or its rest mass. Thus
when a particle is at rest, its energy is (m0)c**2.  As it goes faster its
energy increases rapidly when v gets close to c.  We can interpret this equation 
by saying that E = mc**2 is always true, but that the mass of a particle
increases as it moves faster:

	m = (m0)[1 - (v/c)**2]**(-0.5)

This is one reason whey it takes so much energy to accelerate a particle in a
high energy accelerator.  When it is moving close tot he speed of light, its
mass is so great that you have to add a lot of energy to get a small increase
in velocity.  This is experimentally verified to a high degree of accuracy.

End of quote.

See that the above formulae indicate that it is impossible to travel _at_
the speed of light (because the denominator is zero).  

However, travelling faster than the speed of light results in the denominator 
being an imaginary number.  If your mass is also an imaginary number, there\'s
no problem!  That\'s what tachyons are.

Well...

Here\'s my Cr .02 on it.  A ship design system for Traveller is going 
to be incomplete if it stops at TL 12.  This is not relevant to 
arguments over the year 0 setting.  

If you take a close look at the book, what references there are to any 
setting, definitely make reference to Year Zero.  At year 0, the Imperium 
"might" have records of the Droyne, but remember there are no Droyne 
worlds within Sylean space...  Research is not exactly ongoing, and records 
are almost certainly incomplete, especially given the known weaknesses of 
the Vilani in biology and the life sciences.  Canon definitely has them not 
recognizing the Droyne as a major race, or even as 1 species in year 0.

>From CT Alien Module 5, Droyne, p. 7, comes the following...

"...As a result, the existence of more than one planet full of 
Droyne, even if noticed, would have been a minor curiosity only."

"The Droyne thus remained isolated and obscure during the First 
Empire.  When Terra conquered the Vilani and the Rule of Man was 
established, the Terran conquerers were to busy attempting to cope 
with inherited problems of empire to lavish much concern over the 
individual races which inhabited their new realm."

In talking about the 3rd Imperium, it says the following:

"Originally, the discovery of Droyne with jump drive was dismissed as 
contact with just another minor race."  

The Droyne with J-Drives had been contacted in the Spinward Marches, 
which were not part of either the Ziru Sirka (1st Empire) or the Rule of Man.   
Imperial investigators correlated the Droyne on various worlds within 
the Imperium as belonging to the same species, and discovered that 
the Droyne had had jump drives for a very long time...  Thus 
establishing them as a major race...during the 3rd Imperium.

So "canon" states that the 1st and 2nd Imperiums would know of the 
Droyne, but wouldn\'t know them as 1 species, or as a major race...

As for the "Marc is writing them out of the background" theory, I 
can\'t conceive of it.  This would alter the Traveller backdrop beyond 
recognition...

Without the Droyne/Ancients connection, there are no Vargr, there are 
no Zhodani, No Vilani...or any other human minor race, for that 
matter (therefore no 1st Imperium, Rule of Man, or 3rd Imperium, as 
we know it).  You could more easily write the Hivers, K\'kree, or Aslan 
out of the background than the Droyne.  Their bird-like footprints are 
heavy on the Traveller setting...

Actually, having never played Wing Commander, I can\'t make any 
judgment on the similarity.  If they are so similar, I wonder why GDW 
didn\'t defend their copyright vigorously in this situation...

As for looking like TSR, there\'s a world of difference.  TSR tends to 
steal other people\'s work, get upset when somebody copies their 
stolen goods, and then defend it...  Tolkein, Arneson, etc...  I have 
no problem with somebody defending their own creation.  Frankly, you 
shouldn\'t either...

Companies that don\'t defend their copyrights don\'t last too long...

Since I first purchased 76 Patrons, I\'ve wished for an additional 
supplement like that.  Gamelord\'s "Wanted: Adventurers" was the closest 
thing to it that was ever published, AFAIK.  

If IG would put out a 96-page Patrons book, that would be greatly, 
greatly appreciated. :)

And, heck, while we\'re at it, it\'d be nice to have 96-page versions of:

1001 Characters (With some Casual Encounters-type writeups thrown in)
Animal Encounters
Traders & Gunboats/Fighting Ships (just a book with a huge number of 
                                   ships not included in T4 or Starships)

What can gravtics do, do tell...  that or make up something good
:-)

Gravtics.  I\'ll modulate it with gravtics.  Besides, they don\'t need
to send complicated info!  Just SOS.  And in the Imperium, SOS
using a laser weapon might be defined as a certain very simple
modulation.  I didn\'t say I\'d be broadcasting high-res holographic
images.  Again, agree on a simple SOS, just modulated enough to not
be natural.  Think about the context of this discussion----all I need
is a sky position and an idea of what z is.

Yeah, probably, but you aim as best you can (centered on _world_)
and hope for the best.

This would work well for signalling.

AM would be doable, too.

Have the gravtic focusing turn off and on, so only part of the pulse
will get that benefit.  There, I\'ve changed the pulse width.  Also,
note that arguements about beam spreading don\'t take Bruce\'s gravtic
focussing ideas into play.  Gravtic fucusing is "fact" for this
discussion (it being traveller, not RL).

Use the gravtics to do this.  I say it can.  If Marc says it can,
then it works :-)  Gravtics/damper tech are the big physics nullifier
areas in traveller, use them, they\'re there already!

Again, modulate the gravtic carrier pulse.  If we assume (since it
ain\'t nailed down) the gravtic pulse following the beam model we
might have a modulated grav pulse that results in more beam spread
in some parts of the pulse.

True.  I don\'t know that they can be tuned in-use at TL10, but I\'m
willing to ditch FM :-)

Sounds good.  Throw some gravtics in there as well for kicks.  That
or have a standard way to have the ship give its distance in simple
code (it can look around and triangulate, otherwise the rescuers
have to get a few points to find out (extra time).

Considering that many high-tech starports are on worlds that don\'t have the
tech to support them, I can only assume that starports are
controlled/maintained by the Imperium. There is where you will find the
Imperial government on any world even if it is low tech.

Is there a legal reason for change?  If Wing Commander (and what is Wing
Commander anyway?) was published after Traveller Aslan were published, then I
don\'t see they could threaten legal action.  Of course, I can see various
reviewers calling the original Traveller Aslan "dervivative" because they

I always thought that the worlds could have their own government, but that
each world had a "noble" assigned to it.  The noble was responsible for
seeing to it that Imperial laws were implemented, imperial taxes were
implemented, etc...  
  The reason for "this reasoning" is how does one justify a "democracy"
under an Imperial rule?

  Question:  The job income for player characters is based upon what?  What
basis of comparison is there for saying how much tax income the Imperium
gets and so forth.  My copy of Trillion Credit Squadron (CT) shows the navy
getting roughly 500 credits of tax income per person per year.  So what do
the other branches get?  How much does the government get?  If one assumes
that military spending is up to 10% of the total package of taxes, then the
government is collecting one hefty amount of tax dough!

Actually, I\'ve had a lot of luck running preprepared adventures.  The key is
to give the players a lot of choice about the _style_ of the adventure
(merchant, mercenary, spy, diplomacy, exploration...) and a choice about how
they became involved.  I always give my players some \'time off\' between
adventures where we do some free-form character development: the academics
write books and teach classes, the technicals retrain, repair, and invent
things, and the grunts blow their last commission on Pan-Galactic
Gargleblasters.  I also let the merchant captain do some routine trading,
with the understanding that they must reach a certain planet.

This is a workable compromise for my groups.  We just decided that we were
only gaming the most exciting parts of life.  (I also collapse time during an
adventure: "After many harrowing hours lost in the jungle, you hear...")

	Java is great for writing games !

	A first start will be the Java-Sector Viewer (I think about

Please excuse this off-topic question, but I\'m visiting Canada next week and
would like to add some books to my Traveller collection there, especially
try to buy a copy of the new Traveller 4ed. 

Could anybody here please recommend a gaming store in/near Vancouver that
sells Traveller items?

Strange thought, that. Makes me wish I knew more about the Canadian contribution to 
North American culture. I never got the chance to see him, either.

The folkies I know here in the left armpit of California agree with you, Les, about the 
antiwar tone of Barrett\'s Privateers. The historical record is also on your side, too, 
damn it all. We \'Amuricuns\' faired poorly at sea, John Paul Jones notwithstanding;)

There are a number of fine gaming stores in Vancouver.  If price is no 
option and you are staying near the downtown core I\'d advise going to 
D-Games People in Gastown, it\'s right down by the Seabus and Skytrain 
terminals.  I think it\'s still there, haven\'t been in there in years.  
Probably the best store as far as any gaming material is concerned is 
Imperial Hobbies in Richmond, not far from the airport, ten minutes 
perhaps, it\'s a little awkward to find but Francis has the best 
collection of stuff in the Lower Mainland and his prices are generally a 
little cheaper than anyone else.

I make a weekly pilgramage to Francis\'s to check things out.  8)

Every noticed how, once the English liked a name, they kept using it over
and over all the way across the country?  The Sherbrooke I am refering to is
a very small community (there might be a thousand people there) up the
Eastern Shore of Nova Scotia.  Its probably the only Sherbrooke where (1)
someone named Barrett would have been recruiting prvateers against the Yanks
in 1778 and (2) Halifax would have been a significant stop along the way.

Weak traveller tie in: If you like a place name USE IT.  REPEATEDLY. Confuse
the players with fifty different planets all named in the Old Vilani word
meaning "New Colony"!

My Canada includes at least half a dozen places called

A switch. :)  Seriously, just turning the puppy on and off is fine.  
Coherent light arriving at a system and blinking on some regular schedule 
will be interpreted as a beacon, without any further encoding necessary.

There\'s a very nice rule of thumb used in the backcountry.  Three of 
*anything*...rifle shots, signal fires, flares, flashes with a mirror, 
*anything*...is a (possible) distress signal.  Two of anything means "we 
heard you "  Were I out in The Big Empty with no J-drive but a laser and 
lots of power, I\'d program the laser to send three flashes, as closely 
spaced and brief as the laser could manage, once per day, then climb into 
the low berth and pray.  Lots easier and lower power use than encoding 
SOS in Morse, and just as likely to get attention.

Though to avoid wasting power, I\'m sure that weapon lasers can be cycled
on and off relatively quickly, and that\'s all that really matters.  BTW,
Larry Niven\'s story "The Warriors" turns on a similar question -- I highly
recommend it.

I agree FM is probably out of the question.  AM might be more easily

Completely true, though you could get the 3db lobe into about the orbit 
of Saturn from 1 parsec, if I\'ve done my back-of-the-envelope correctly.

Two examples:  Morse code is PWM, serial data on a modem line is PCM.

I think you\'re (slightly) overestimating the difficulty of giving a laser
AM capabilities...and were I a starship weapon manufacturer, I\'d build it
in as a selling point.  "Not only does the new Iludium Q-37 100 MW laser
feature our award-winning HandWavePro gravitic focusing, it comes with an
AM signal shunt at *NO EXTRA CHARGE*!  When you misjump into the Great
Rift, you\'ll be glad you have it -- or sorry you don\'t!"  This is so
potentially useful and relatively cheap that I\'d tend to assume any
non-KMart laser would have it.

And unless you need the noise-resistance to capture your plaintive cries

there\'s not real point to FM in this application.

I can\'t imagine a laser which wouldn\'t allow a 10/10 sec duty cycle
indefinitely.

What, you have something better to do with your time? :)

Hey, I\'ve got them, let me go dig them out....yeah here they are! They are
both slim little booklets, but I didn\'t pay much for them back in 1981. <g>

SCOUTS & ASSASSINS 
    The Scout Character Generation and a couple of Ship
descriptions.  The Assassin Character Generation is for the
Assassins Guild and is a couple of pages in the back.

MERCHANTS & MERCHANDISE
    A Merchant Advanced Character Generation process and the first
    appearance of several skills we all know and love.  There are
    several equipment/merchandise descriptions in the back.
    
I never bought the Intellegence Agent booklet, kicking myself, but I
remember seeing it in the stores.

Maybe that\'s why I didn\'t buy it.  Looked at it and put it back, I\'ll bet.

  If it is possible to jump 36 parsecs - as per the "accidental misjump

We can say that the shipyards building the jump boats were on
the verge of TL-16 and this ability.  The Regency is able to 
produce TL-16 ships,like the Darrian Patrol cruiser, in its
shipyards.  

This also helps us get rid of the problem of Jump Torpedoes, by saying
that the Imperium can\'t produce them.  Well it doesn\'t actually get

IMHO , the Imperium would have enclaves (where Imperial, not local laws 
apply) an any A,B and C Starport. Take Pournelle\'s Co-Dominion as an 
example. While the plabet is not planning inserection against the throne or 
disrupting 
trade, breaking imperial eidicts whatever, The I-men will leave you 
alone. Break any of the above and meet Mr Augumented BattleDress 

Possable Imerial activities at an enclave :

1. A X-Boat collation point. A transmition point where all message to the 
X-boat system is collated and beamed to the X-Boat changeover point. 
While this is likely to be automated, the location needs to be protected 
(guards, security systems , point defence). 

2. Imperial Consule. A person outside the local Feudal chain of command, 
to co-ordinate travel permits to Imperial and Non Imerial worlds, 
co-ordinate customs enforcement, Act as a sort of Interpol for the local 
government(s), etc. Could be a career Mandarin or a Navy officer, or a 
imperial noble.

3. ImpSec. Possable manned inside the Imperial Consolate, collates 
infomation for local forces or Imperial command (subsector/sector etc).

4. Beuro for Callander Compliance, and other Vilani organisations ment to 
stifle technolagy (whoops , I mean enforce Imperial safty legislation  
and tax regime etc)

Stealing from *one* source is plaigarism. Stealing from a whole bunch

I\'ve never played it either. But I have read one of the novels that
"spun off" (hey it was by one of my favorite authors, I bought it and
*then* found out it was a game spin-off).

They may not be terribly similar. And they almost certainly aren\'t
similar enough to win a copyright infringement case. But *trying* to
win such a case would make IG look like TSR to some folks.

Copyrights aren\'t "defended". Trademarks are. Copyrights may be
infringed, in which case you can nail the turkeys, but you can also
just go "Oh, it\'s some fans, ignore them" with no danger to your
copyright. 

The only way to lose a copyright is for it to expire (now a matter of
50-75 years after the author dies!) or to have someone prove that you
didn\'t really write it, or that you stole not merely the idea, but the
*expression* of the idea. 

In other words, Tolkein couldn\'t sue Terry Brooks, even though the idea
in Sword of Shannara is almost identical to the one Lord of the Rings
is based on. On the other hand, if someone took either book and
essentially did a search and replace on the character names, *they*
would be in big trouble.

My point is that modulating high power signals is *known* technology.
They\'ll quite likely ring a lot of changes on it, but it\'s just not the
sort of thing that you\'d build into a weapon, as it complicates things
and adds failure points.

We could rig your car so you could modulate the exhaust for use as a PA
system, too. But why would anyone add all the extra complications?

"Width" as in *duration*. Morse code uses PWM. Dashes are longer than
dots. There\'s no way that anybody on the far end is gonna know that the
beam *width* has changed. They *might* notice that it got dimmer, but
unlikely.

Except that they *aren\'t*. Using gravity to focus is one thing. We know
gravity can do that, it\'s just handwaving as to how to get it to do it
when we want. Likewise, we know that the weak force and the
electromagnetic force are part of the same "electro-weak" force
(similar to the way electric and magnetic forces are part of the
electromagnetic force). We know that the weak force controls some types
of nuclear reactions. We also suspect (but haven\'t proven yet) that the
strong force and the electro-weak force tie together too. The strong
force controls the rest of the nuclear eactions.

BTW, you *might* manage to argue that gravitics can change the
rise/fall time of the *pulse* (but it\'ll take a *lot* of arguing). But
you *can\'t* argue that they will affect the rise fall times of the
*power system*. And *that* is the bottleneck I\'m talking about. When
something is carrying a lot of power, there are severe restrictions on
how fast you can change the power level without frying everything in
sight.

That\'s only shifting the problem from modulating the power level of the
laser output to modulate the power level of the gravity field. And on a
*continous beam* laser, the focusing can\'t be a following pulse,
anyway. That only works with *pulse* lasers.

And modulating the gravity field is actually going to be *harder*
simply because of the *known* way that changes in gravity field
strength affect light. You need even *more* control to do it that way
than you would to do it via the laser power level. 

Again, the problem is in the controlling of the power, when dealing
with such high power levels. Changing from controlling the power going
into the laser output stasge to controlling the power going into the
grav focuser makes no difference. Either way you are trying to
"smoothly" vary the power *input* to something that was designed around
some rather specific "on/off" conditions.

I seem to recall that more than half the states in the US have a town

I can\'t help but think that one thing T4 should adopt from SF is an
idea from Andre Norton\'s "Solar Queen" series. Once the Scout Service
has made "First Contact", or surveyed a world that doesn\'t seem to have
intelligent life, the trading rights are auctioned off in a sealed bid
auction. 

What the "rights" give you is a monopoly on trade with the natives for
a fixed period (10 years?). Unless it is obvious that there\'s a good
deal, the corps tend to let the Free Traders get the initial rights. If
the planet is a bust, tradewise, it\'s not their problem. If it does
have something that is valuable, they can try to buy the rights from
the trader (or try dirty tricks if they think that they can get away
with it :-)

Uninhabited worlds my tend to get handled more like in H. Beam Piper\'s
stories. You can try for an Imperial Charter for your company, whichh
is will exploit the planet, and given the Imperium its share of the
profits (if you lose money, that\'s *your* problem :-). Look at the
history of the Hudson\'s Bay Company, and the British East India
company. 

In areas that have been inside the Imperium for a while, the situation
is more like current world trade. There are already "established"
routes. If you want to make money, you find a way to do things faster
or cheaper than the competition, or you think of a new trading angle
(like PepsiCo making that deal to swap Pepsi for Stolichoyna straight
across. A *beautiful* example of "lateral thinking" to get around a
problem with trade rules and exchamge rates)

So, as usual, the frontiers will be where the guy with a small ship and
a willingness to take chances can make a *big* fortune. The more
established areas will be more a matter of spotting a good deal here or
there. It\'s a different *sort* of trading.

Nope. Stop and consider. If you take a freighter to Japan, *sure* you
can buy enough cars to fill it for a trip back to the States. But
unless you can buy them *cheap*, you\'ll lose your shirt, because you
can\'t sell them as cheaply as the guys who have the big car carriers,
and contracts with the manufacturers.

It\'s not a matter of *efficiency*, it\'s a case of the market already
being "taken".

Okay, this is a case of either a *temporary* situation or of a *new*
market/supply opening up. Big corps are much more interesting in being
able to keep racking up that 10% month after month than in having to
reschedule some ships for a situation that\'ll only last a few months.
It\'s not worth the extra trouble, even if the profit is 30%. So
temporary surpluses/shortages are one of the ways a small trader makes
good.

If a new market opens up, or a new supply does, both the small guys
*and* the big guys are going to be interested. But as long as the small
guy doesn\'t screw up, he can react faster. 

Another trick, gleaned from Heinlein\'s "Time Enough for Love" is that
most traders, especially the big outfits go for a double-ended run.
That is, you pick up something that is cheap at A, but sells well at B.
At B you pick up something that sells well at A. 

This sort of run is easy, as long as the market is steady. You can
start at either end with some cash, and just keep building profits.
Megacorps love these runs. Damn few Free Traders have a chance.

But the prize for a Free Trader is finding a *three* cornered run.
Point A has somethiong that point B wants. Point B has something that
point C wants, and C has something that A wants. Get an intitial cargo
at A, and follow the route A->B->C->A... and you\'ll make lots of money.
Get it backwards and you\'ll *lose* money just as fast. 

Adding more hops tends to increase the risks without a proportional
increase in profits.

Here on Earth, the most famous triangular trade was sailing to Africa
to pick up slaves, selling the slaves in the Caribbean for rum, and
selling the rum in New England for cotton cloth and cheap beads, which
you used to buy more slaves in Africa. 

So any viable trade system needs to allow for a relatively constant
demand for certain items, as well as a relatively constant *supply* of
others. And those items *should* be determined by world type. Just be
sure to have a fair number of possibilitities to choose from. This will
give you your long term trade patterns. And no one has ever drawn up
this sort of thing!

The sort of thing all the trade tables I\'ve seen are intended for is
"speculative trade". That\'s the "temporary market/supply" bit. In this
sort of trade, all cargoes are pretty much one-shot. Say, for example,
you are in Yokohama and find out that there\'s a lot of 100 or so cars
available because of a last minute change in an order from America
(some order for a corporate fleet "bumped" the cars off the ship, and
made them "surplus"). If you\'ve got room to haul them, you might happen
to know that some place in Africa or South America that normally gets
cars "thru" some other country would pay high prices for them, and
they\'d likely have something (ore, spices, fruits, handcrafted stuff)
that you can sell somewhere else.

But we need *long term* trade tables, and we also need them to include
a roll for a change in circumstances (the mine played out, they
switched to a different crop, they produce higher tech stuff now,
whatever) both good and bad. That way, there\'s always the chance that a
new market or supply will open or an old one will go away. 

But the long term stuff isn\'t much fun for most players, except when
they are *establishing* the trade, or trying to salvage the pieces
after a change.

On the other hand, it is something the *refs* would really like to
have. It gives you a better idea of how the planets interrelate.

BTW, just one interesting "side effect" of a long term trade setup.
Consider that with J1 or J2, you may only have a few possible "trading
partners". And they\'ll likely be playing the "middleman" role that made
the Middle East so rich. 

No consider what happens when J3 comes in. Suddenly, you can make one
jump trades with people you couldn\'t trade with directly before. That\'s
gonna shake things up a lot.

So every time there is a local *or* a general increase in things like
jump tech, the trade patterns are gonna shift *radically*. And that
makes for all sorts of oportunities.

Funny thing. In the Year 0, we have:

1. new frontiers (expanding the Empire)
2. improved jump tech
3. improved power sources, etc

#1 gives lots of room for exploration, and new goods and markets.

#2 gives a major shakeup in existing markets. 

#3 gives a whole bunch opf new/improved products.

So the traders will be busy.

You need to get to a UNIX prompt, go to the directory where you have
saved the file, and use chmod to change the file permissions. I believe the
command is something like:
chmod <filename> 664
but I could be wrong. Look at the man pages for chmod when you log in
by typing: man chmod. 

Hope this helps!

It is the 4th revision of Traveller.  It is being produced by Marc Miller at
Imperium Games.  The best place to go for imformation is their web site at
http://www.imperiumgames.com/

    'body' => '     Hi all,
     
     I had to unsubscribe from all my RPG lists last month because of the 
     volume of non-work mail my employers were receiving, but things seemed 
     to have quietened down again, so I\'m re-subscribing to Traveller 
     digest only.
     
     I don\'t know if anyone has posted on this subject yet, but I thought I 
     would give my impression of European Gen Con.
     
     EGC was run by TSR at Loughborough University this year.  The last 
     time I went to EGC was about 4 years ago and it was at Camber Sands 
     Butlin holiday camp (affectionately known as Stalag 14 by the 
     inmates^H^H^H^H^H^H^H attendees).  Loughborough is much closer to my 
     home, so I decided to drive down on Friday afternoon.  I was due to 
     referee in the Traveller tournament, so I thought I\'d better allow a 
     couple of hours to meet Andy (Lilly - BITS co-ordinator) and read the 
     rules.
     
     After a 2 and a half hour drive (remember, this is on narrower British 
     roads in a Mini Metro averaging about 80MPH) I was feeling exhausted.  
     I said hi to Andy (who I hadn\'t met in person before), grabbed a copy 
     of the rules (and bought "A Long Way Home" - the T4 approved adventure 
     produced by BITS, plug, plug ;-)) T-shirt & label (in case I forgot my 
     name, no doubt) and headed for accomodation.
     
     I dumped my stuff, ate, and read the task / combat system.  By this 
     time I was feeling in a complete daze, and the only thing keeping my 
     mind focussed was the fact that I was going to be refereeing in an 
     RPGA sanctioned tournament for the first time, using a set of rules 
     I\'d just flipped through and with someone else\'s adventure (I\'m 
     terrible at remembering the details in bought adventures - I usually 
     just wing most of it, but this was a tournament, gulp!).
     
     Back to the main hall.  The other referees looked as nervous as me, so 
     I didn\'t feel too bad.  I met Jo Grant at some point (like I say I was 
     still in a daze) and one of the referees who is also on the list 
     (sorry, I\'ve forgot your name already - the one working at Newcastle 
     Uni), which was very nice.  The first team of players arrived - they 
     looked pretty serious, so we referees huddled in a corner hoping that 
     one of us would volunteer to go over and ref the game.  Andy chose a 
     "volunteer" and the first game began.  Two other teams arrived, and 
     two other referees went over.  This left me with no players :-(, until 
     the reserves turned up (and I\'m sure Andy press-ganged a couple of 
     people...).
     
     "OK, it\'s only a game and they\'re here to enjoy themselves" I kept 
     telling myself as I explained the rules (well, actually, one of the 
     players explained the rules to the rest - I believe in delegation 
     ;-)).  Fortunately, it *is* only a game and they *were* there to enjoy 
     themselves.
     
     I won\'t go into the scenario, in case Andy plans to run it again, but 
     I don\'t think it\'s giving too much to say that there is a very 
     definite time limit.  My team started slowly but gradually speeded up 
     until the end which produced such an adrenaline rush.  At T-4 minutes 
     one player had to make a mission critical task check and he failed.  
     Everything stopped as the players looked at me, and the computer 
     expert asked if he could try again.  "Sure", I replied, leaning back 
     in my chair, "in a couple of minutes...".  I let them stew for another 
     60 seconds (hey, "sadism" *is* my middle name) before giving the 
     player another chance.  They finished with 2 minutes to spare.
     
     I think everyone enjoyed themselves (at least they said they enjoyed 
     themselves ;-)), and I would recommend that anyone else play in the 
     adventure if they get the chance.  I don\'t recommend trying to fill 
     out the RPGA scoring sheets, though; that took almost as long to do as 
     running the adventure ;-).
     
     I retired to bed exhausted at this point, and woke up with what felt 
     like a hangover (except I\'d only had one pint all day) in the morning. 
     I refereed one demo game, which was a bit more relaxed for me than the 
     tournament, but had to decline running another because my head felt 
     like it was being squeezed in a vice.  Instead I wandered about 
     looking at all the other games & trade stalls until the bar beckoned.  
     I did manage to play in the tournament adventure (run by Andy for fun) 
     and it was still quite exciting.
     
     On Sunday I lay in, then sat in on a seminar (which wasn\'t what I was 
     expecting - I thought Ken Whitman was going to be talking).  Oh, did I 
     mention that Ken Whitman was there, as well as Chriss Foss?  
     Unfortunately, I didn\'t get to speak to either of them as my headache 
     / constant tiredness was making me feel particularly introvert (which 
     is a big shame when you\'re at a convention :-().
     
     I set off home on Sunday afternoon and found out that my wife had also 
     been feeling unwell over the weekend - I guess there must have been 
     some bug going around.
     
     Right, I\'ll finish here.  Last paragraph, I promise.  I enjoyed EGC, 
     and would have done so a lot more if I hadn\'t been feeling under the 
     weather the whole time.  Andy did a great job of organising the 
     Traveller "presence" there, including the Tournament and demos all 
     weekend (as well as selling copies of the rules, and encouraging 
     people to join BITS).  Lots of others helped out, and I think a good 
     time was had by all.  Hopefully, lots of people bought the rules and 
     Traveller was given a high profile in the UK.
     
     Anyway, it\'s nice to be back on the list again.
     
     Cheers,
     Liam

Well, the "off the cuff" response is that there are only 6 alternate
realities of J-Space (Designated J-1, J-2, J-3, J-4, J-5, and J-6).  How
then can you jump 36 parsecs by accident, I\'m not sure, but my guess is that
it has to do with the gravitational effects on J-Space.  We are told that
ships actually travel in J-Space.  It could be that the Gravitational well
(100 dia limit) actually propells a ship faster through jump space than is
possible with a normal entry.  Necessarily, then, this Gravitational effect
would have to be unpredictable and random.  If it weren\'t random, then J-1
to J-36 would be possible.

I would immagine that if it were possible, Grandfather would have learned
how to control it and therefore would have achieved a stable J-36.  Someone
with the adventure(I think its Secret of the Ancients), can you tell us
whether or not Grandfather\'s Jump Gates (IIRC he had some of these in his
Pocket Universe) were more than J-6?

	All I need is to reprogram the firecontroll/beam computer
	to switch the HPG beteen 3 minute pulses (normal for non
	military lasers) and 36 seconds pulses (you normaly use
	this frequency to ignore 0,3 ligth seconds) These two
	frequences are standart on any HPG !

	But most important is that you pray befor you step into

1.	EXEC ORDERS

BTW, did you know that Tom Clancy is a mate of Larry Bond (of _Harpoon_ fame
- - another GDW product). They played out _Red Storm Rising_ using Harpoon,
and then Tom wrote it all down. Did a similar thing for _Hunt for Red
October_, AFAIK... (thus says Hyphen, desperately trying to find a link
between TC and T4...;-)

2.	FUEL EXPLOSIONS

Jeff Nort suggested:

The rules for this state that _anyone_ immersed in L-Hyd is dead, dead, dead
- - the stuff is so insidious that it penetrates seals on all personal
life-support, even battledress and hostile environment vacc suits.

3.	INFANTRY

Doug said:
>United States Infantry- "Follow Me!"

Safer than being in front, is it? ;-)

4.	MINIATURES AND MAPS

BTW, did you notice that the old deck plans were in half-inches, *NOT* 15mm
per square! (This was almost pointed out by Leonard). The scales are:

	0.5 map inches = 1.5 real metres
	15mm figurines = 6 real feet

Now, 0.5 inches per map square = approx 12.5 mm, when the squares should
really be 15mm.
This means that THE OLD MAPS ARE ALL TOO SMALL for the 15mm figurines we
place upon them!

No wonder it looks as though you can\'t swing a cat in any of the ships!

5.	IRON FIST

Allen, I\'ve looked thru _Far Traveller_ #1 and #2 (the only issues AFAIK) -
where is the "Iron Fist"?

6.	LENTULI

Loren Wiseman asked:

>Another question: My files are inaccessible to me right now, can some

>Lentuli subsector, and the sector in which Lentuli is located? I may

Gee, I wonder who is doing an article on Bwaps (Newts to the rest of you)?
The article in _JTAS_ #11 mentions the planet Marhaban, of the Lentuli
subsector, in a throwaway opening line. It also says that the Newts are from
"the region trailing and coreward of Capital", within the Imperium.

I did...and I _loved_ it. Here in No. California, it is a mark of distinction among 
long-term Traveller fans to have the Paranoia Press supplements in their bag \'o tricks.

Back when CT ruled the gamestore shelves, it was the massive amount of shelf space that 
all those "Liscensed For Traveller" supplements grabbed that gave the game so much 
exposure. In the cross-liscensed, multimedia market environment of the 90s, going into 
comics, tarding cards, movies, software is the same basic strategy.

Okay, Allen, Rob Liefield can\'t draw a straight line with a ruler . . . but so what? IT 
HAS TO HELP promote the game.

I\'ve always assumed that there was one, and better jump drives took
better advantage of it.  Alternatively, I guess you could look at
\'layers\' of jump space, where you go \'through\' J-1 space to get to J-2
space, etc.  Picture a spectrum of colored borders around the flickering
opening into jump space, one border for each layer of jump space you go
through.

In the above scenario, a misjump may be due to crossing \'folds\' in the
\'layers\' between different jump spaces, with a G-well making the folds
more frequent or convoluted.  

As they go into jump:

	Sensors operator: \'Uh, Captain, sensors here.  That jump portal didn\'t
feel right.  There seemed to be some extra \'waves\' on the monitor ... \'

	Captain: \'(whisper) oh, sh-t! and 3 months till retirement! (normal)

an inventory of life support and food supplys, NOW!  (PA) Astrogator,
lay to the bridge!  (PA)  All hands, this is the Captain.  Now, there\'s
no need to panic, but ...\'

OTOH, it may be a matter of future discovery of additional J-spaces,
with accidental access near G-wells ...

IIRC, Grandfather\'s pocket universe in SotA was only about 3 parsecs
across, and the portals were J-1 with a normal 1-week delay.  I don\'t
remember any info about portal use outside the pocket universe.  I\'ll
see if I can dig it up.

wondering about the removal of such long standing stalwarts as Mesh, Cloth

descriptions fail to tell how much the armor costs. Diplo Armor is the major
case of this. This combined with the large amount of white space on page 80
leads me to beleive that an Armor Table must have been missing. The curious
thing is, mesh armor is mentioned in the combat examples, but is nowhere to
be found in the book! Anyone care to confirm or deny the presence of a

The "fool" was Canadian Pacific Railway Vice-President William Van Horne.

He suggested the name to honor the English sailor Capt. George Vancouver,
who was one of the first white explorers in the area (circa 1792.) The
provincial legislature incorporated the town of Vancouver (British Columbia)
on April 6, 1886.

The town of Vancouver (Washington state, in the U.S.A.) had already been
incorporated for almost 30 years (it was incorporated on Jan. 23, 1857.)

Just think of the FASA _Renagade Legion_ universe with its grav tanks.

Not to mention assorted civilians -- both friendly and enemy -- and possibly stay-behind 
troops. The latter would be a small team in an air raft armed with lotsa antiarmor 
missiles. Mission: to locate and attrit lightly-armored supply columns, not to fight 
MBTs.

Yep, the "PAK front" as we know and love it is not going to work. Nor is the NATO 
concept of the 3,000-meter battlefield (PAK front with ATGM). 

One historical model that comes to mind for maneuver warfare is that of the Mongols. 
Keep on the move, strike hard, don\'t let the enemy catch you. Mobility, not terrain, is 
your defense.

	My turn to say "nope."  The reason you can\'t "sell them as 
cheaply" is because you are not as _efficient_.  Contractual 
arrangements, large orders, etc. are all forms of transactional 
efficiency just as real as the operating costs of your ship.  If you 
_could_ sell the cars more cheaply than the other guy, you could quickly 
take the market from _him_.

	I can accept this as a motivation for the cargo availability 
tables.  In fact, this even makes a good deal of sense.  
	What it does _not_ address is the situation when ships on the
order of Subsidized Merchants and Free Traders are the regular conduits of
trade for a particular world.  This may be because the world has only been
recently recontacted, because it is off major trade routes, or just too
small.  In such a situation, these small ships are the most efficient
around and will not be "beaten out" in the attempt to get good cargoes. 
They should be able to have their pick, if that is, they can pay enough 
to make it worth the while of the natives to trade. They will be able to 
pay if there are enough unexploited trading opportunities out there so 
that they can cover the extra cost and more.

	This is another problem with the trade tables.  According to 
them, if you happened to pick up the above load of automobiles in a place 
like Japan, the best place to sell them would be a place like the U.S. 
(Rich, Industrial, High Pop).  What it should say, as you point out, is 
that the best place to sell them would be some place where the demand for 
cars is not directly met by the big, highly efficient corporate 
shippers.  
	This is why I proposed the trade goods price mods for location
(Core, Frontier, Deeps).  A more complicated system would extend the mods
to worlds which would be exceptions to those rules.  A high pop world on
an important main in the Frontier is likely to have very good price levels
while a runt world in the Core may have poorer ones.

	Right.  I have been trying to describe how the Year 0 
interstellar economy would function and how small fry like PCs might fit 
into it.  Trade _tables_ is not how I would do it, I would describe trade 
_flows_ , probably in fairly broad terms (industrial, consumer, 
agricultural, materials, etc.)  These would be less vulnerable to 
change.  Lewis, Paul, and I are currently trying to do this on a much 
smaller scale in the RC.

Actually, just slightly less than 1/3 of the states have a town/city
named "Salem."  There are 16, to be precise: one in each of Arkansas,
Illinois, Indiania, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire,
New Jersey, New York. Ohio, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Virginia,
West Virginia, and Wisconsin.

There are 8 states that have a town or city named "Portland."  They
are: Connecticut, Indiana, Maine, Michigan, North Dakota, Oregon,
Tennessee, and Texas.

OK, enough geography lesson for today. :^)

I recently ran a campaign in the Solomani Rim. The players found that the Vegans
had managed to recover quite quickly from the effects of the Collapse, and were 
beginning to expand on to worlds which had previously never belonged to them.
Even though many Vegans had died in the collapse, they now had restored
most of their worlds to TL-13.
They had also become very aggrivated with humanity, and were not interested
in peaceful contact, yet!

  By the way, this topic of trade, which system of speculation is being
used, Classic Traveller, or the version introduced in Merchant Prince, and
MegaTraveller?
  Personally, one of my gripes with the "newer" version of speculative
trade is based upon the fact raw materials coming in from a low tech world
are worth less than raw materials from a higher tech world.  In the
example I concocted earlier with my gaming group, there is a tech level 14
world that needs raw materials for their industry.  A tech 10 world is
producing 1 million tons of material yearly.  Another world, at tech 6 is
only producing 100,000 tons of material yearly.  At the Tech level 14
world, they would like 15 tons yearly.  The question would be: why would
the value of the raw material be significantly less valuable from the tech
6 world, than from the tech 10 world?  One player suggested that the
"impurities" in the raw material might make the material worth less to the
tech 14 world.  Another pointed out that that it might be cheaper for the
tech 10 world to produce the raw material - to which I said "so?".  Let\'s
take food for an example: why would the same strain of wheat, grown on a
tech 6 world be less valuable than wheat grown on the tech level 10 world?
Food is in demand regardless of where grown ( unless the other worlds use
pesticides ect that a tech 10 world would not).  In any case, I suspect
that for those who own a copy of TRAILBLAZER from METAGAMES, their method
of dealing with trade makes a bit more sense - but that version is not for
the weak of stomach <grin>...

My understanding was that jump drives weren\'t used at all. The transition between
systems was made by flying through teleportation portals.

The portals were made by pinching of a section of the universe, and detaching it from
the rest, except for a few portals. Through these portals you could enter and
leave these "Pocket" universes. Now, these portals could be carried around and used
anywhere to enter.
Inside the pocket universe two portals could be bought together, in the real universe
these portals could be seperated by great distances (parsecs?). So if you entered
one portal, you instantly appeared out the other.
The limit on the distance you could travel was how big the pocket universe was.
If the pocket universe was 30m in diameter, the distance the portals could work
in the real universe was 30m (I think).

Another interesting idea was that the power generation for the portals was inside
the pocket universe. Usually an asteriod or small planet. (I always loved populating these 
places with ancient robots, some still fighting the final war.)

	Normaly Jayhawks filling tempoary situations. They normaly

	A free trader is like a trucker who owns his truck, paying

	The corps are interested holding the traders down, they
	make the 1kCr + handling price, they make the price of
	LHy at the startport ! You need traders to fill the gaps,
	but they should\'nt make the market.

  4.	And a new imperator interested to feed his suporters (the
	big corps) so the money will be made by the corps, the
	traders will suffer as usual !

	Because the droyn\'s are stupid like dogs without their Myncen.

	Perhaps Grandfather (and his childs) had discovered the meta
	mathematique of missjump points, who knows ? As known about
	the Chirpers/Droyne, any Acient Relict is based on a totaly
	different kind of technologie. If one of them discovered how
	to build up pocket universums, I\'m shure an other had discovered
	missjump points. Its also known that they had only several
	hundred years until they fall in a black war destroying
	everything.

	So there are 3 posibilities :

	- They know missjump points, but had no time to use it,
	  so there are no relict missjunp computer/drive.
	- They used missjump points, they needed them for cultivating
	  the charted space in only several hundret years, so
	  you\'ll find such a drive in several acient ships.
	- They dont had missjump metamathematique. (This is IMHO
	  unlikely)

	But even the discovery of an relict missjump drive, wouldnt
	change the world. The high tech development in the best of
	imperials times was able to rebuild black globes without
	understanding them. But missjumps are meta mathematique dealing
	with the unlikely inside of chaotical systems. You could\'nt
	use missjump points without understanding them, even if you
	have the drive ;-)

My basic method:

     1: Determine 4 colors that will compose the camo. (Varies with
environment).
     2: Paint the areas that will receive the camo the lightest color
first. Let dry.
     3: Heavily stripe it with the next lightest color. Let dry and repeat
for the rest
          of the colors.
     4: Let dry, wash with the darkest color you\'re using.

"Marhaba" is Lebanese rural dialect for a phrase of greeting roughly
equivalent to "Howdy!" I added the terminal "n" and I had a world
name (you\'d be surprised where these things come from sometimes).

I had fun writing it, but it _drained_ every adventure idea I had for

None of us ever played Wing Commander either (none of us had a great
deal of spare time for _playing_ games)...and no one pointed it out to
us (assuming there is anything to the comparison at all).

Uh...I must respectfully take issue with this statement, as far as the
Aslan are concerned (and likewise with the accusation that we lifted
the Aslan from C J Cherryh\'s Hani, which used to be tossed at GDW about
three times a year -- one might as well say that we stole the Aslan
from the Egyptian pantheon\'s goddess Bast!    : )

One of our "fans" once turned us in for stealing the Ancients from
the Hee-Chee. We got a phone call from the relevant author\'s agent,
sent copies of the relevant products, and got a letter apologizing
for bothering us.

     on the average world within the Imperium? 
     
     I think the Imperium would have representatives depending on their 
     interests in the planet or system. As a rough rule of thumb, I would 
     suggest that representation be something like this: 
     
     If the world is Tech 12+, population 8+ or a subsector capital; the 
     Imperium will maintain an Imperial Embassy with full Imperial offices, 
     including an office for each branch of the Imperial government 
     (Ministry of Justice, Imperial Treasury, Diplomatic Service, ...)
     
     If the world is Tech 9+, population 6+, law 8+ or government 6,  
     (colony world) or is the homeworld of a minor race, the Imperium will 
     maintain a consulate, including at least two Imperial staff and 
     whatever representatives of the Imperial administration are necessary 
     to protect Imperial interests (eg Ministry of Colonization if planet 
     is being colonized, Ministry of Justice if local law regularly 
     interferes with Imperial law (hence law 8+), Treasury if high 
     population (ensures Imperium gets its taxes!))
     
     If the world is starport X, interdicted, tech 4-, law 2- or govt 0, 
     the Imperium will maintain a number of observers (read: spies) or a 
     small consular office with a single representative, basically to 
     maintain a watch and call for help if Imperial interests are being 
     threatened. This presence will be low key (if not invisible) so as not 
     to interfere in local affairs. 
     
     Other planets of particular interest to the Imperium will have 
     consulates, embassies, research stations, naval bases, military bases, 
     etc as the Imperium sees necessary. 
     
     Outside the Imperium - the Imperial government will maintain at least 
     a small consular office on worlds that have client state status or are 
     special to Imperial interests in some manner. Non-imperial subsector 
     capitals will have at least Imperial consulates, while homeworlds of 
     major races will have full Imperial Embassies.  
     
     I understand these \'rules\' are a bit dodgy, but having a rule of thumb 
     like this will help the poor Ref who\'s put on the spot when the 
     players suddenly decide they want to see an imperial representative :]

While I wrote up these ships for the RC setting, they fit in
very well with the Year 0 Imperium, these ships could be
built by a low tech planet that the Imperium comes in contact with.

As always hope this is useful.

PS I put the ship descriptions in both T4 and TNE style write ups
Personally I prefer the TNE style, with its much greater detail,but
I figured I\'d be modern and include the T4 style.

   The Archangel is produced by Bourgund Shipyards on Oriflamme.  Oriflamme
possesses the largest shipyard in the RC, but it is as yet unable to 
manufacture jump drives. To utilize the excess capacity, the Technarchs
have ordered large numbers of SDBs. This serves several purposes; it puts
tens of thousands of workers to work.  When the shipyard does start to
manufacture jump drives, these workers will be highly trained, and will
be able to produce large numbers of ships for the growing markets.
A second purpose behind the expansion, is that Oriflamme needs a large
navy, both to patrol the new merchant traffic and to protect against 
Vampire incursions.  
   The Technarchs also want to export SDBs to other planets, both inside
and outside of the RC.  Only Aurora and Aubaine are able to produce ships
for their own defense. The Aubaine shipyards are busy producing jump capable
ships, and have long waiting lists.  Some might question the sanity of 
selling warships to planets in the Wilds.  It is actually a very good idea, 
SDBs are not usable for offensive purposes, no one will be able to conquer
their neighbor with a fleet of SDBs, they will be able to protect their
planet against Vampires, pirates, and marauders.  This will help promote
the development of these planets, and increase trade between the RC and
the Wilds, eventually leading to the expansion of the RC.  
   The Archangel class is built primarily for Oriflamme use, it is fairly
expensive, costing just over 1 Gigacredit.  The difference in exchange
rates between Oriflamme and Aurora/Aubaine makes it a little more 
reasonably priced, (about 24%) but still expensive.  The Warlock class and
the Serpent class are more suitably priced for export. 				  
   The Archangel is capable of 4G acceleration, this is extremely high for
a ship without gravitic compensation. The crew is protected by workstations, and
grav tanks. This allows 3Gs of acceleration to be ignored. All crewmembers
also have neural jacks installed, which allow another diff mod to be ignored.
The ship is only able to evade at 3Gs, without the crew suffering penalties.
Crew members without workstations, notably the maintenance and medical staff
and restricted to quarters while the ship undergoes high g maneuvers.  
This makes damage control rather difficult, but high g maneuvers are performed
infrequently, and only during combat situations.  
    The Archangel is a sphere with two hamster wheels attached to the sides.
These allow the crew to sleep and recreate in normal gravity.  The crew sleeps
in large barracks, but they don\'t have the standard bunks, but rather 
hammocks, which can also be used in zero g situations when the hamster 
wheels aren\'t not functioning.  The ship design is very cramped, and all
crew members are carefully screened to eliminate those who have psychological problems
problems with this.  The Oriflamme navy maintains a very high morale, by
offering signing bonuses, extra shore leave, and providing very high quality
food.  Also there is a mystique about the navy, which assures that there 
will always be qualified applicants.

    The Serpent class was built using lessons learned in the designing the 
Warlock class SDB. Its designers thought it was a bit to small to be called
a System Defense Boat, so the type designation System Patrol Boat was 
created.  The Serpent has the same performance as the Warlock, but without
the planetary bombardment facilities, the Configurable Pod, and a smaller
cargo bay.  This allows the ship to be built on a smaller hull and for
considerably less money.  The Serpent gives three times as much personal
room to the crew members. The crew still sleeps in the traditional 
hammocks, its just that there are less crew members for the given space.
	The Serpent is designed purely for the export market. The salespeople
pitch the ship as a small highly armed ship capable of patrolling a system.
It won\'t take out a Vampire Capital ship, but is more than capable of 
fighting off a pirate, smuggler or rebel ship.  As with the Warlock, Oriflamme
will sell service contracts to perspective buyers, and will provide crews.
Some of the Bourgund Technarchs are trying to apply political pressure to
other Centrist planets, so that they will buy Serpent SPB, instead of buying
standard SDBs from Aubaine or Aurora.

	The Warlock class SDB was originally proposed as an alternative to the 
Leviathan class Assault ship. The original plan was to equip a Maggart with
3 Warlocks.  The Maggart would orbit the planet providing fire support,
while the 3 Warlocks would descend to the surface, land the troops, then
take the air to provide fire support.  This has several advantages over
the Leviathan class; First the Maggart is available for other missions
when an assault ship is not needed.  Also the Warlocks would split
the troops into three sections, during atmospheric descent, which is when
the ships are at their most vulnerable position. prejudice against low
tech ships helped kill the Warlock assault ship design. Some Oriflammi 
also blame the Aubaini for shooting down the proposal purely
because it came from Oriflamme.  
     After sinking millions of credits into the design, and constructing
several examples of the class, the Bourgand Technarchs were faced with
a ship without a mission.  The finally decided to market it as an export
SDBs.  It is fairly inexpensive, and provides a great deal of flexibility.
It has a 100 ton pod bay.  Pods can be used to carry extra space misses
or planetary strike missiles, extra troops, small craft such as fighters
or assault landers. Extra weapons can also be installed. It has 85 tons of cargo
hold, allowing the ship to carry supplies for a great deal of men, extra
troops, or even armored vehicles for the troops.  The ship also comes with 
missile bays for either planetary strike missiles, cruise missiles or air to
air missiles. It also possesses a large bomb bay, allowing the ship to bomb 
planetary targets.  The ship is very heavily armored allowing it to
shrug off most lasers and PAWs.  It is also sufficient to shrug off
the blasts from an Intrepid tank.
	The Warlock will never be a capable of fighting off a TL-15 warship on 
a one for one basis, but in groups it would be able to protect a planet
from a small vampire ship.  It is quite capable of serving as a customs
vessel, and protecting merchants from the standard Corsair.  
	The Oriflamme salespeople do a wonderful job of selling the ship to
Wild clientele. They promote the versatility of the ship, while glossing
over the poor sensor suite, and limited maneuverability of the ship.
Most of the Wild leaders they are selling to, haven\'t had any formal
training in modern naval warfare, and are easily dazzled with flash and
gloss.  				 
     Most clients in the Wilds, do not possess starports capable of 
maintaining and servicing the ships, so Oriflamme is happy to sell
service contracts.  They will also provide crews for the ships, or
train native crews for the ships.  All for a nominal fee of course.
Occasionally the salespeople will cut a deal, if they are guaranteed
long term service contracts, or if the buyer buys in bulk.

   The Galahad Monitor is produced by Bourgund Shipyards on Oriflamme.   
It is the largest non-relic ship in the Oriflamme Navy. None of the other worlds
of the RC has purchased a Galahad, and unlike other ships, the Technarchs
don\'t intend to export the Galahad.  They believe, rightly so, that none 
of the other RC worlds has a large enough economy to purchase Galahad
monitors.
   It is intended to protect vital areas
of the Oriflamme system mainly the homeworld, and the gas giants.  
One thing of note about the Galahad, is that the range of its PAW far
outstrips its feeble sensors, it usually operates with a vast sensor
net made up of drones, and planet based sensors.  
   The Galahad class is a very compact design, there is a minimal amount
of space for the crew. The crew sleeps in the traditional hammock of the
Oriflamme navy.  This saves space, and also allows the crew to each have
on individual bed, rather than sharing an actual mattress in the normal
hotbunking scheme.  The crew often sets up recreation facilities, in the
cargo bay, between rows of cargo pallets.  Zeeball is a popular activity.

So a fancy yacht named the Fire Drake, would have a 3D image of
a dragon on the hull.  

Another possiblity that I just thought of is, animations. This could
be holographic or just 2D images.  The above dragon could breath
fire that danced around, the dragon itself could fly around the hull.

Of course these animations would be fairly useless in deep space,
so they probably would only be turned on in port.  I imagine

     Hey, Andy, *wake up*; you\'ve got a customer.
     
     The adventure is set in Year 0 and starts in the Core sector.  It\'s a 
     mini-campaign, actually.  I haven\'t had a chance to read through it 
     all, but the PC\'s are the crew of a scout ship about to embark on a 3 
     month survey mission (IIRC).  Needless to say, things don\'t go quite 
     to plan.  It features a subsector worth of systems (a lot of them full 
     systems, not just the mainworld), a new 300 ton scout ship design 
     (including floor plans) and is about 64-96 pages long (I think).  Oh, 
     yeah, the QSD ship designs are fantastic ;-).
     
     Andy Lilly, the BITS co-ordinator, can be contacted at:
     
         A.S.Lilly@nortel.co.uk
     
     and he might just have recovered from EGC by now (or maybe not :-)).

76 patrons was invaluable, especially for diversions from larger campaigns.
Hopefully, IG will include a dozen such encounters in the back of every
source book and publish a larger collection.

Maybe we could write such a thing here on the TML.

Yesterday I\'m flipping thru V&V.

Up to now, I\'ve kept having this idea that the
Long Night ended at Year 0.... when in reality it
had ended many centuries earlier.

To quote from V&V:

"Then, in -495, advance scouts from the Sylean Federation
contacted Vland. The Viliani leaders were first unconvinced
that the new Sylean Federation had any influence over the
interstellar lanes."

So, the Syleans had dreams of empire on their collective minds
for maybe 5 or 6 hundred years before Cleon finally crowned
himself Emperior. Perhaps the Syleans had desired an emperor for
centuries and Cleon was the first person with the balls
to take on the job!

Later,

"Centuries later, diplomats from the Sylean  Federation
repeatedly approached the Igsiirdi about Vland officially
joining a new and expanding "trade federation" of Cleon.
Finally, in -30 our ilani ancestors agreed, but stipulated that
membership in the federation ... must not try to impose
Sylean culture on the Vilani."

Quotes are from V&V, pps. 21-22.

Anyways, perhaps it was the entrance of Vland into
the trade federation that gave Cleon the legitimacy
to declare himself Emperor.

BTWm, from looking at the TL tables in MT, no one is likely to have
anything greater than jump-2 in Year 0, right? The Terrans
had Jump-3 during the Nth Interstell wars and the rule of man, 
but that\'s TL 13 and all gone now... the rediscovery of
jump-3 will "shrink" the new empire signifigantly...

ANyways, just some thoughts,
Ethan

I hate to mention the triangle trade was TOBACCO to Rum To Slaves.  And
Triangle trade only works when there is a freely convertable monetary source
on one of the points.  Some of the most effective trade routes are 5 or 6
points shuttling increaing value commodities each time

You don\'t know the half of it.  "Follow Me" is the motto of the US Infantry.
At Ft. Benning, Ga., their is a statue called Iron Mike in front of Infantry
Hall that shows a WWII platoon leader charging forward.  Even the Infantry
Center and School patch has that damn phrase on it.

The theory is that if you run out of every other option, you yell "Follow
Me!" to your troops, and charge the enemy.  Right.

The unofficial (and banned) motto of the enlisted infantry is: "Have Fun Sir!"

I think you are forgetting two things: Supply and the Infantry.  Armies,
even at TL12 require vast amounts of supply.  Consodering that we discovered
that even at TL15 it was more effcient to arm grav tanks with railguns as
opposed to plasma weapons, you will be called upon to transport *tons* of
ammo to every tank battalion in combat.  

Tanks cannot hold terrain.  this is a basic fact that the Germans understood
in WWII.  You have to put the Poor, Bloody Infantry in to root out the last
of the resistance and physically take possession of the disputed area.
Tanks are very poor weapons in an urban area. their limited vision cripples
them.

Transport becomes a issue here.  How many tanks can you bring with you?  I
imagine that the aggressor will be fairly armor-light, expecting ortillery
to support their mostly infantry based ops.

Sure there is a way to stop the end run.  It\'s called the reserve.  A smart
commander *always* keeps some forces held back just in case.  Also, if both
forces are TL12+, the intruding grav tanks will find themselves targeted by
missles designed to shoot down tanks.

If the invading force has such absolute orbital control that the invaded
world has no effective defences left, you\'re right.  Turn out the lights,
the party\'s over.  However, if resistance continues, I wouldn\'t want to
leave my ass hanging in mid-air for hours while I climbed for orbit.. just
waiting for that missle battery or interceptor to knock me down.

With drop troops, once again you have to realize that the enemy shoots back.
Read up on some of the mass parachute drops of WWII.. Those guys were in the
air for about a minute and usually had suprise.  A jump troop drop will be
in the air for a *long* time.  A desperate defender might launch a nuke set
to explode in the middle of the drooping capsules, eithe killing or
scattering the the troops over a wide area (this works against tanks too.)

Exactly.  Make the enemy come to you.  The defender has a 10:1 advantage
when in prepared positions.  When you have the time to set up interlocking
fields of fire, minefields, pre-planned artillery fires, primary, secondary,
and fall back firing positions, you can give the incoming bad guys a real
hard time.

Here is your big error. When you are in a good defensive position, STAY IN
IT.  Patrol aggressively, but make them come into your trap.  The advantages
are numerous:

1.  Your supplies are where you want them
2.  The enemy has to attack, the most dangerous operation.
3.  The enemy gives up his mobility, forcing him to crawl towards you.
4.  You can run SpecOps aginst his supply lines, further crippling his
effort.

Artillery is the killer, has been since WWI.  Your comment about "brilliant"
missles once again points out that grav tanks will spend most of their lives
hiding in the trees.  

While artillery is deadly at TL12+, counter-battery fire will get get better
also.  During the Gulf War, the US could return fire onto the Iraqi unit
before the first Iraqi shell hit the ground!

Picture this:  You launch several drones, each programmed to look for either
tube fires or missle launches.  When the drone sees one, it reports to its
controller, and then streaks off to the launch site to try to kill
something.  The drone is given vehicle profiles for the enemy, so it can
look for the most important target.

Warfare at TL12+ will be different to be sure, but the basics will remain
the same.  To sum up my points:

1.  Grav Vehicles will tend to stick close to the ground and cover.
2.  Battles around strongpoints will neutralize the attackers mobility
3.  If one side has overwhelming orbital control, the battle is over.
4.  For every improvment, the counter-measure will improve.
5.  The defender always starts out with an advantage.

The way I calculate it, 0.5 in = 12.5 mm represents 1.5 m = 59 in = apx
5 ft, giving 2.5 mm per foot.  A 15 mm figure representing 6 foot also
gives 2.5 mm per foot, so they match.  Of course, if the 15 mm
measurement is at the eyes (say about 5.5 ft), you get about 2.7 mm per
foot.  Even so, this is only about a 10% difference.  

I suspect most miniature vs. deckplan problems are due to either poorly
scaled minis or a perception of increased size due to the large bases
(which can\'t be easily helped).

No big deal, just running on at the brain :)

I agree with Tom.  If you think of grav-capable AFV\'s has being comparable
to a modern attack helo, but with superior armor, weapons, sensors, and
loiter time, then you begin to have a better sense of what a team of
tanks can do.

Consider: a Trepida-class grav-tank has firepower superior to a modern
AC-130H Spectre gunship, and maneuverability superior to an AH-1H Cobra.
A team of these (3 tanks), combined with grav-capable support AFVs (2-5
more units), and a platoon of grav-equipped infantry in battledress,
would be able to hold a medium-size town (pop. ~50,000) for an indefinite
period, assuming constant re-supply.

BTW, even present-day tanks *can* hold terrain if deployed properly.
Read Harold Coyle\'s novel _Team_Yankee_ for a chillingly accurate
portrayal of tank warfare at the edge of WW-III.  Also, as additional
references, I\'d recommend the following books on armored conflict:

"Armored Cav" by Tom Clancy.  An excellent overview of a modern armored
cav. regiment from a layman\'s viewpoint.

"Warfighting: Maneuver Warfare in the US Marine Corps", edited by
Lt. Col. H.T. Hayden.

"Tank Attack: A Primer of Modern Tank Warfare" by Steven Zaloga.

The next five books are all narratives and treatises on Desert Storm.
  "Iron Soldiers" by Tom Carhart.
  "Crusade" by Rick Atkinson.
  "Desert Storm Ground War" by Hans Halberstadt.
  "From Shield to Storm" by James Dunnigan.
  "Certain Victory: US Army in the Gulf War" by Brig.Gen. Scales.

  Hmmm, I seem to recall a different table for TTF modes. It shifts the
hit locations *drastically* to the underside. Believe me, there *isn\'t* a
loophole if you READ THE RULES (RTFM)! ;)

  There is one DUMB rules conflict though - auto-crashes when the pilot
goes unconcious, for example. Elsewhere it\'s stated that the pilot doesn\'t
control the altitude of the tank directly, yet you *have* to ground your
tank when the driver goes unconcious or dies. I\'ve gotten into a few hot
arguments about this btw, though not about this specific rule (damn FASA
ambiguities...)

> Hey, IG! Wanna co-opt the RL rules and use it for ground combat? ;->

   I *already* use Centurion for the basic movement rules for grav tanks,
I use "standard" FF&S/TNE combat rules for damage.

This is, indeed, an oversight and should be changed, unless... you consider
the belly to *be* the facing side. :^)

In the descriptions of aerodynes/AVs for Cyberpunk 2020, the heavy armor
is described as covering the front, bottom, and sides, while the top and
rear are more lightly armored.  Since grav-vehicle basically represent
a higher tech configuration of the same type vehicle, I\'d think similar
armor arrangements would be appropriate.

Actually, when you think about it, heavy grav vehicles ought to have
something like retractable point-defense systems in the belly, to deal
with situations just like the one you describe.

on a single sheet to make life easier.  It\'ll be part of my screen.  I
did it in MS Word for W95 (6.0/7.0 format) and posted it on my Traveller
web page as a self-extracting zip file.  Since it has a lot of tables
and frames, it\'ll probably be messy to convert to other formats, but
I\'ll try if I get a chance. (yeah, right!)

http://www.umr.edu/~mkm/trav/travpage.htm

It\'s got an outline of the T4 ground combat system and the following
tables: 

Encounter Range
Encounter Range Terrain DMs
Surprise DMs
Initiative DMs   (mostly house rules :) )
Task Rating/Combat Range  (as book but reformatted)
Armor (with some info guessed at)
Combat Pools (quick desc. of tactic, attack, defense, and fatigue pools)

A few things didn\'t make it into the combat outline, such as:
	Special rules for bow/thrown weapons
	Multiple actions 
	other?

It\'s only got a few house rules on it, as follow:
	Initiative DMs for individuals 
		No. of 4-yr terms in Army or Marines div by 2 (round up)
		No. of 4-yr terms in Navy or Scouts div by 3 (round up)
		Dex/3 -2 (truncated) This gives -2 at 1-2, -1 at 3-5,
			0 at 6-8 (avg), +1 at 9-11, etc.
		 	I\'ll need to play test this a bit :)

	Ranged attack DM of -1 for non-pistol weapons at Close range.

	For damage dice reduced to 1 point by flex armor, I count 3 such single
points as 1D for purposes of the 3D limit on damage.  This gets rid of
the case of 3D+3 damage when hitting a 3D flex armor with a 6D weapon.

	Some estimates for cost, TL, and mass in the armor table.

There\'s also a separate weapons table.  I corrected a few apparent
errors and added extrapolated version of the gauss pistol and gauss
rifle.  I also tweaked a few archaic weapons ranges, but I\'m still
looking at that in light of the two range bands change for thrown/bow
weapons in the rules.  I don\'t have that straight yet.

I hope this helps someone out.  Comments on my modifications would be
greatly appreciated.

RL is a spiff game system that suffered from a number of problems: the over-complex 
damage-by-template system was intended to be an advance in the state of the art over 
the straight-ablative systems of _BattleTech_ or _Car Wars_, but somehow gamers didn\'t 
really like it. In spite of the problems, I wrote some optional rules for RL:Centurion 
that GDW published in _Challenge_. FASA even picked up some of the ideas from my 
rules articles for the Centurion Terhnical Handbook.

Nightshift Games/Crunchy Frog holds the rights to Renagade Legion. Nothing new has been 
published for RL is a couple of years, what with what\'s happened to RPGs and boardgames 
in the last few years . . . . ;)

I remember the original _Striker_ referring to grav tanks as \'gunships.\' Not a bad

Against what? 

Attacker tech level, the surrounding terrain, and force composition are important 
considerations as to weather the force could hold or not. Basically this is in 
infantry-heavy company team with some attached support holding the town.

Interesting tactical problem you\'ve suggested.

 . . . i.e. with infantry and artillery in close support and while dug into favorable 
terrain.

_Team Yankee_ is to the Armored Force in a fictional WW3 what McDonald\'s _Company 
Commander_ was to the Infantry in WW2. I\'d also recommend Coyle\'s _Bright Star_, which 
concerns a battalion task force as opposed to a company team. The latter book features  
an armored war of maneuver with the infantry doing the traditional "hold-ground" 
mission.

I\'ve read this one; it\'s a honest history of the war, perhaps brutally so. Atkinson is a 
skeptical journalist from the old school, so those looking for a book glorifying the 
Persian Gulf War should look elsewhere.

Hmmm . . . me too. And not only for TTF; the table covers LAF (I think that\'s  the 
abbreviation, my copy of RL is not here at the computer I\'m using).

The rank of Master Gunnery Sergeant is for those senior NCOs (the next
lowest grade for them is Master Sergeant) in technical fields (for instance:
communications, supply, admin- in my battalon, we had a Master Gunnery Sgt
in S-3).  They have the same grade as Sergeants Major (E-9), but the rank
signifies a different type of job.  However, in the U.S. military, there are
ALWAYS exceptions...

I believe you are referring to the split between TTF and LAF. THAT is where the
issue arises. He stays at TTF,as I recall, with a ltank mounting the
10pt-damage laser(multiples, if I remember correctly) with nothing but front
armour, parks at extreme range and hoses down anything that moves. Very
effective. He\'s a rules lawyer of the old school, and for this reason I no
longer want to play with him. He\'s designed unrealistic tanks for extremely
limited tasks and wins by virtue of a specific limitation in the rules.

oh, mai oui, I HAVE RTFM.

Not exactly.  I asked Tom Clancy about this the one time I met him, 
and he said that they *tried* to play out RSR, but that things  
wouldn\'t always come out in a manner that was useful for the story, 
so he wound up winging it (my words, not his).  However, the naval 
battle for Iceland section was played out using Harpoon.

approaches zero growth, so who is to say if a declination in popultation

For that matter, what of the automated TL 15 research facility, fully

some new supplies every 20 years or so, and won\'t have a sustainable gene 
pool, but they \'have the technology\' so to speak.

Tying maximum tech level to population, regardless of trage (of *course* 
any planet that *can* trade probably will! we are greedy creatures after 
all!) would not be a good idea IMHO.

T4 is still unavailable in the UK, well at least in the Virgin Megastore in
Sheffield, so those of you who have one (or more !!) copies should consider
themselves lucky to be closer to the source than the rest of us. Guess I\'ll
have to wait for my hardcover.

The recent conversations reguarding officers rising from the ranks was
highly amusing.
Tom Opgenorth\'s comment on what happens to seemingly normal NCO\'s upon

Personal experience seems to suggest that a labotomy of some desciption, or
at least heavy brain washing is a pre-requisite for "advancement of ones

BTW maybe this only affects any military service whose roots have been
tainted by the British at some point ? Nice job.... shame about the bullshit !

A question.

How do you subscribe to the GDW-Beta everybody keeps metioning ?



Now a Wanted/Swap Ad:

If anybody has a spare copy of JTAS #22 that they would like to sell, I
could offer a good price, including postage etc,. Or swap for JTAS #10 and #11.

I thought I\'d found a copy on the Traveller Chronicle site, but it turned
out that the list was.... a little out of date shall we say.

I knew somebody was going to bring this up.  In battle, there is NO substite
for the Mark 1 Sensor Suite.  Your eyes, ears, and nose are better at
finding the enemy than any mechanical aid.

Let\'s say you\'re coming after my squad in a war-torn city.  How are going to
find my guys.  Visible light?  We\'re wearing cammo, and a thick coating of
mud and dust.  Sound? Noise discipline is a must in combat, and even
listening for body noises won\'t help (battlefields are noisy places, and the
thuds of weapon fire and explosions, plus the sounds of broken water/sewer
lines, nask human body sounds.)

IR?  Half the place is on fire!  Density scan?  Bodies is bodies, they mass
the same alive or dead.  And so on...

Meanwhile, while you are spinning dials and checking screens, I\'m getting
into position to put an anti-tank weapon up your tailpipe (or the equivilant).

I don\'t have to kill you, just make you combat ineffcient.  Also, in a
street fight, you won\'t have room to manuver when I send three missles
straight toward you...

Never depend on your sensors.  I hunted tanks in the Army, and many M-1
crews found themselves locked into their tanks after we climbed onto them
and padlocked the hatches!  In an open area, I, and my future
brothers-in-arms, will be happy to do our ground squirrel act, but urban
areas is Infantry country.

Again, there are ways to spoof Apaches.. the most obvious one is to get the
crew to look one way while your Stinger man launches from the other side.
Same tricks will work on grav vehicles.

That\'s at a cost of about 121.5 *million* credits to hold one fsirly small
town.  I didn\'t even bother to figure the cost of the troops\' personal
weapons.. (Figures from the Regency Combat Vehicle Guide)

BTW, even present-day tanks *can* hold terrain if deployed properly.
Read Harold Coyle\'s novel _Team_Yankee_ for a chillingly accurate
portrayal of tank warfare at the edge of WW-III.  Also, as additional
references, I\'d recommend the following books on armored conflict:

I disagree.

We are currently what? TL-8? on Earth. This could be sustained with
fewwer than 100 million people. In fact, when you stop and think about
the number of people who contribute *nothing* to maintaining our
current tech level, we pretty much *do* support TL8 with a (relevant)
population of less than 8.

Consider some of the lower tech levels and this becomes a lot more
obvious. 10,000 people can do a tech level all the way up to pre-civil
war if they have the right resources on hand. But by your rules, TL4 is
the limit...

For that matter, just consider the tech level changes this century.
Wre\'ve gone thru several *without* a 100-fold uncrease in population.

You don\'t have to hate to mention it.  <g> Tobacco *was* part of the trade,
but it was the sugar that made it a SWEET deal for the merchants.

The most notorious triangle was sugar from the West Indies to New England
where it was purchased for the manufacture of rum.  (Much of the rum ended
up in England, were it was traded for manufactured goods. Some of that came
back to New England and some travelled to Africa to buy slaves.)  The
merchant bought some of the cheap rum with part of his profits and sailed
to the west coast of Africa to trade the rum for a ship load of slaves. 
(The slave traders used the rum to pay off native tribes that were raiding
the interior.)  The slaves were sold in the West Indies to the owners of
the sugar plantations. (The sugar plantations were notorious for working
the slaves to death so there was always a market for more workers.)  The
merchant bought cheap sugar with part of his profits and sailed back to New
England to start the cycle again.  There was potential profit for the
merchant at every stop.

Tobacco was also part of a triangle, but during the heyday of the slave
trade wasn\'t nearly as profitable.  It also generally had a different
cycle:  tobacco to England for manufactured goods; goods to Africa for
slaves; slaves to the American south and the West Indies for tobacco.  

And yes, there was a lot of overlap and many shippers cycled though 5 or 6
exchanges of cargo in these "triangles."  So "triangle" isn\'t really
geometrically descriptive.

   I find them to be quite gripping. Do you get the feeling that he\'s

Actually, the company I used to work for (in the travel industry) 
used to get all kinds of angry customers in Portland, Maine looking 
for our location...  We of course, only had a location in Portland, 
Oregon...

Eventually, we opened a location in Portland, Maine, in part (so I\'m

I don\'t expect anyone to do anything; the premise of this list, as far as
I can tell, is that we all run our own universes as we see fit, and take
or leave what is said here.  As far as canon holding that honorable nobles
were really the norm, show me. 

Remember that I don\'t disagree that the rhetoric of noblesse oblige and
noble honor was extensively disseminated among all classes during the Rule
of Man and Third Imperium.  I\'m just saying that nobles weren\'t in fact
noble.  They were presumptively ignoble, but marketed themselves well. 
Probably some of them really did believe the rhetoric;  certainly all of
them used it.

Even the Spinward Marches has at least two worlds named Kinorb, two named

to me that there are several other names used by more than one planet in 
that sector alone.

Just a quick message to anyone asking about The Long Way Home and how things
went at Euro GEN CON.

I\'m not currently receiving TMLs so I\'m afraid I\'ll be a little slow
answering. I\'ve called Rob Miracle to see what the problem is.

Just briefly, yes we sold loads of them, yes they have a nice colour cover,
yes they\'re designed for Milieu 0 but each scenario can be picked out for
use in a different campaign if you prefer, yes Lester Smith himself is
reviewing it (potentially for a magazine review I believe), yes, it\'s
available mail order from BITS, but I\'ll like to be honest and say that if
you can wait just a month or two then it should be available in the US from
Sword of the Knight. If you really want it before then (or want a copy with
one or both authors\' signatures) then I\'ll be posting mail order prices
soon, including potential air mail costs, etc.

No, my brain hasn\'t recovered from EGC yet. Yes, I\'d like to thank all the
people that helped (tournament ref\'s Dave, Liam, Colin, Paul) and
particularly Jo and Lesley Grant and my wife Sarah, without whom I\'d have
had a nervous breakdown.

Yes, Imperium Games liked our ideas so much we\'ve been asked to pursue
several as potential products, including a suite of Traveller software.

I\'ll try to answer specific questions just as soon as I actually receive the
latest TMLs.

What is the message I learned from Euro GEN CON?

     comments and queries I\'d like to throw to the list for discussion.  
     Since I\'ve been off the list for the last month, these may have been 
     done already.  If so, could you tell me the digest number & I\'ll get 
     it from the archives.
     
     1) Initiative
     The three options given are to give the smaller group initiative, roll 
     1 die and add the highest leadership score and either apply to the 
     whole group or roll individually.  [Aside - I like the way several 
     options are given - it "legitimises" the idea that you should use 
     what\'s best for you, rather than using a strict set of rules, by 
     showing rather than telling.  When I was 12 or 13, if it didn\'t appear 
     in the DM\'s Guide, then you couldn\'t do it; and if it did appear, that 
     was the only, and exact, method to determine how you did it.]
     An alternative system I have seen used is to make DEX+1D6 rolls for 
     everyone (i.e. opposed DEX rolls), and this worked well.  Has anyone 
     else come up with their own system?
     
     2) Full Auto Fire
     The rules say that a -DM for the range is applied, and damage is 
     doubled (after armour).  There is also a chance to hit adjacent 
     targets, and rules for suppression fire.  Again, I\'ve seen an 
     alternative where the referee simply allowed two attacks.  Thoughts I 
     had were along the lines of rolling once at normal chance to hit, 
     again at 1 diff greater, etc, until a shot misses, then apply damage 
     seperately for each shot.  Unfortunately this adds extra rolls :-(.  
     Another thought was one round hits per number that the roll was made 
     by (divided by the range number, maybe), or similar.  Anyway, what 
     does anyone else do?
     
     3) Difficulty vs DM\'s
     I like the task system.  It worked well in the games I refereed or 
     played in.  We had no problems with d3\'s - although there was nearly a 
     heart attack when one player saw a 6 appear when they were defusing 
     some explosives, only to realise it was the D3.  The only inelegancy 
     is the mixing of difficulty and dice modifiers.  Rather than getting a 
     -4 on skill to hit someone under cover, I think it would be better to 
     make the task 2 levels more difficult (i.e. roll one extra D6 for an 
     average of 3.5).  It\'s not that this causes any problems, or anything, 
     it\'s just that skills are a constant and difficulty is changed 
     depending on the situation.  To then go and modify the skill roll 
     because of a changed situation seems counter-intuitive.
     What does anyone else think?
     
     4) Called shots
     I found this part confusing.  The method for resolving a called shot 
     is not in the section "Called Shots".  There is a method explained 
     under "Increased Damage Attacks" which talks about increasing damage 
     inflicted by targetting, for example, lungs, but it isn\'t explicit as 
     to whether this also allows you to ignore armour.  For example, space 
     ork is shooting WH40K space marine Captain (who are reknowned for 
     *never* wearing helmets); if the ork is aiming for the marine\'s head, 
     does he have to go for the double damage shot (or the tripple damage 
     shot) to avoid hitting armour?
     
     
     BTW, these aren\'t meant to be negative comments about the game, rather 
     I\'m following the philosophy espoused in the rules of taking what\'s 
     there, using what I like, and changing what I want to.  Overall I like 
     the rules.

 For what it\'s worth, the Tolkien estate engaged in a vigorous
 defense of copyright against T$R not long after T$R did the
 same against someone else.  The result was (among other things)
 that there are no more "Ents" in T$R products.  There will also
 _never_ be an authorized Middle Earth product from T$R.

 I believe that this was the first (and so far only) time that
 T$R lost in court.

This may be true.  But why would you want to waste the mobility of the 
tank in a static battle.  Also, what if the town is hostile?  You will burn 
out your infantry real quick, having 35 guys policing 50,000.  Then when 
they get tired, some saboteurs sneak in, and mess with you tanks.  Of

Within certain parameters, yes this is true.  The same is true of tanks 
from WWII.  Tanks properly deployed have supporting infantry and 
artillery, maybe even engineers.  Nowadays no combat arm works 
independently of the other.

Doug, I think your gound-pounder background is showing.  I don\'t mean
this in a derogatory way, I\'m ex-USMC myself (back in the stone-age.)
However, I believe the a lot of fighter pilots would tell you that
their electronic warning suite is at *least* as important to them as
the ol\' Mk-1 eyeball.  The problem with aerial combat (which is what
we\'re discussing) is that the eyes can cover a 360 degree sphere all
at once, whereas properly configured sensors can.

A properly configured Expert System can incorporate raw data from all the
sources you\'ve named and advise the combatants of 90% probabilities.
Sure, there\'ll be ways to defeat them (holographic masking, thermal
masking, et.al.), but that\'s war.  Defensive technology advances at
roughly the same rate as offensive technology.  The problem is that
both offensive and defensive tech improve faster than the human eye
and/or ear evolve.  Believe me, the sensors will eventually outstrip
human senses by so much that it would be foolhearty to not use them.
Perhaps not with today\'s tech, but certainly by the 3rd Imperium.

Yes, there are.  But with "smart" defensive suites, it\'s getting harder
and harder.  You can\'t distract a computer.

This can be both a blessing and a curse, depending upon whether the system
is properly designed and programmed.

Quite true, but I don\'t recall what the figures for inflation are for
the 3rd Imperium, or the Regency.  Those costs *may* not be unreasonable.
(Who knows?)  However, considering that in todays "Mobile Armor", the
same compliment that I described (above) would be about the proper size
to deploy against a medium size pop. center, one might assume that
similar tactics would be used in the future.  However, given that an
individual armored infantryman (in the 3rd Imperium) is the equivalent
of a 20th Century tank (from a fire-power standpoint), perhaps only
the infantry platoon would be necessary.  OTOH, assuming that the
insurgents may be similarly armed and armored, I\'d opt for the tanks. :^)

True.  However, his book is still one good look at ground war from

All very true, Tom.  The bottom line is that you can\'t pacify a
population that collectively refuses to *be* pacified.  There will
always be guerrilla warfare waged against your troops by the locals
until genocide is required. :^(

Um, I don\'t think so.  Or, at least, there were a couple of potential court
cases that TSR settled out of court.

1)  Dave Arneson vs. TSR.  Settled out of court for back royalties, and
turbo-charged TSR\'s push for AD&D as a "separate" game from original D&D.

2)  Chaosium, the Lovecraft Estate, and Michael Moorcock vs. TSR.  Seems that
TSR told Chaosium that the latter couldn\'t publish Call of Cthuhlu as TSR had
already published Lovecraftian material in Deities and Demi-Gods.  "We think
that the Lovecraft Estate will find that very interesting," replied Chaosium. 
"And we\'ve taken the liberty of contacting Mr. Moorcock\'s solicitors in London
about a related issue."  (the Elric mythos material that also appeared in
Deities)

I read an interesting book (okay it was a long and boring book -- I forget the 
title) where this "womyn" researches the charity and giving ethic in the U.S. 
among the so-called, philanthropic elite (rich folks, that is).

There are some interesting parallels to what she observed among these people 
and the debated attitudes and behaviors of the Imperial nobility.  For 
instance, she observed a form of noblesse oblige among the "old-monied, upper 
class" when it came to giving to charities, supporting their alma maters, and 
starting foundations.  

Many of these said they gave because "that\'s what we do" and "that\'s the way 
daddy did it and his daddy before him."  She would then assert that the hidden 
benefit to giving to these organizations would be an avenue for the wielding 
and exercising of power for the philanthropist and little or 
less-than-satisfactory actual benefit to the needy.

The point is, (at least from the author\'s perspective) those actually giving 
the donations actually _believed_ they were operating from self-less motives; 
but actually were benefitting indirectly from their activities.

I imagine the nobles of the Imperium are much the same way:  there are very 
few really *evil* nobles and very few saintly nobles.  The majority are just 
like the rest of humaniti, doing what they think is "the right thing" but in 
denial as to how "the right thing" serves their own generally, selfish 
interests.

So in those cases, wouuld the bureacracy be in a large building in the capital

Thanks you for this!  I only wish that more of the discussions here would 
result in some suggested rules or guidelines.  I\'m afraid that most folks 
willl talk incessantly about military ranks, trade, or fusion refining -- but 
only rarely produce some sort of practical application for those of us who 
know little about the topic, but are greatly interested.  Thanks again.

Concerning the whereabouts of the Imperial representation, I think 
you would find it near the centers of government, rather than at 
the spaceport (unless you found it at both).  I am thinking of 
historical precedents.  Judging by Pontius Pilate, Rome\'s represen-
tatives stayed in the local capitals, not the seaports.  Ditto, I 
think, for the representatives of the British Empire.

But of course, the stronger the attachment, the more widespread the 
representation.  If a world is very important to the Empire, I\'d 
expect, say, a governor\'s office/mansion in the planetary capital, 
prefect\'s offices in all the major cities on the planet, and some 
major finger in the pie at the spaceports, e.g. the customs officers
report to the Imperial chain of command.  Something like that.

A possible T4 adventure hook here - one of my college friends now works for a 
major investment firm.  His job is to analyze the code of some of their 
stock-trading expert systems and find out how to trick them (the intent being 
to spot and plug the holes before they get used by _real_  market criminals).  
He has described expert systems in that profession to be very good, but says 
that if you have access to the code, any two-year Wall Street veteran can 
figure out how to manipulate computer-directed trading quite easily.

I would expect this to improve somewhat in the future, but even then _knowing_ 
the parameters an expert system works under makes it very easy to work out 
countermeasures to that expert system.

As a T4 hook - imagine the lengths the Imperium would go to in defending the 
code (not the compiled executables) in such an expert system.  And imagine the 
lengths other organizations would go to in trying to obtain the code for 
analysis.  A bit cyberpunk, perhaps, but an interesting twist on a Traveller 
espionage adventure.

The Medium Mortar rules. They originally appeared in Challenge #45, I think (no copy at 
hand). I also did some infantry quality-grading rules that went beyond the ones 
originally in the game.

     An alternative system I have seen used is to make DEX+1D6 rolls for
     everyone (i.e. opposed DEX rolls), and this worked well.  Has anyone
     else come up with their own system?
====================

	I agree about the various initiative systems. Not only does it
legitimize rules customization, but also allows situation-by-situation
changes in rules which are very helpful.  
	I thought up an idea for an initiative system, though I haven\'t
yet tried it:  You divide each side in the fight into "fast" and "slow"
halves based on Dex.  You then roll group initiative and have people take
their actions in the following order: 1)  Winner\'s fast half, 2) Loser\'s
fast half, 3)  Winner\'s slow half, 4)  Loser\'s slow half.  This is
basically a compromise between individual and group initiative. 


====Liam said:================
     2) Full Auto Fire
	[snip]
     targets, and rules for suppression fire.  Again, I\'ve seen an
     alternative where the referee simply allowed two attacks.  Thoughts I
     had were along the lines of rolling once at normal chance to hit,
   again at 1 diff greater, etc, until a shot misses, then apply damage
     seperately for each shot.  Unfortunately this adds extra rolls :-(.
     Another thought was one round hits per number that the roll was made
     by (divided by the range number, maybe), or similar.  Anyway, what
     does anyone else do?
=====================

I\'m not sure I like your alternative.  There\'s no chance of missing your
main target but hitting secondary ones.  The "two attacks" rule is simple,
but I prefer the "main target and n adjacent targets" rule.  It\'s simple,
(reasonably) realistic, and elegant.


====Liam said:===========
     3) Difficulty vs DM\'s
     I like the task system.  It worked well in the games I refereed or
     played in.  We had no problems with d3\'s - although there was nearly
	[snip]
     is the mixing of difficulty and dice modifiers.  Rather than getting
     -4 on skill to hit someone under cover, I think it would be better to
     make the task 2 levels more difficult (i.e. roll one extra D6 for an
     average of 3.5).  It\'s not that this causes any problems, or
     it\'s just that skills are a constant and difficulty is changed
     depending on the situation.  To then go and modify the skill roll
     because of a changed situation seems counter-intuitive.
     What does anyone else think?
====================

	I like the task system as well. I frankly don\'t understand all this
complaining about d3s. I\'ve used them for a long time in Traveller (for
small amounts of damage, etc.).  If the problem is one of players cheating
by choosing which die is the D3 after rolling, then one should probably
change players.  It\'s the same problem one has with percentile dice: you
have to color them differently and declare which one is the tens die
before hand (remember: "Greens is teens" ? how \'bout "Dark is demi"?).  
	I also agree that they shouldn\'t mix up their modifiers.  Keep the
targets constant and change the diff or vice versa, not both.   
	Does anyone else like the sneakiness of making DM stand for
"difficulty modifier" instead of "die modifier"?  I thought that was
pretty cute.  At first when I was skimming, I was confused by the n-
targets with the +n DM\'s to make the task easier.  I kept thinking "but if
you add to the dice,that makes it harder!"  Then I thought "oh, you must
add to the target, but then the mods should be called TMs for \'target
modifier\'."  I went looking for a section on DMs, praying IG hadn\'t goofed
up something so fundamental and grinned broadly upon reading of
"difficulty modifiers".  Real cute.

 4) Called shots
	[big snip]
=========================

I haven\'t gotten to called shots yet.  My beef is with the snapshot rule. 
Excuse me, but _no_ range modifier based on weapon type?  Give me a break! 
I could certainly see reduced modifiers, but a rifle is going to have way
better chances hitting something at range than a pistol, no matter whether
you take careful aim or not.  Please tell me I\'ve misinterpreted this
rule.  Otherwise I\'m simply going to make snap shots one or two difficulty
levels higher than aimed shots and always use the rule for aimed shots...

	We currently have a population code of 9 and a modifier of 5.3

	In my theory a higher techlevel needs a larger diversification

	But how long, soon they have to salvage things to repair other.

	These formulars are intended for making a limit to World
	Tamers Handbook, to implement the badly need of trade,
	and to give some numbers at hand. They also show that

	of suffering trade. This happend in the black nigth and

	What do you call "relevant" population ?

	Even if you think that we dont need the people in africa
	(hey we are ritch because they are hungry ;-) the pop in the
	industrial country sums up to a pop code of 8-9.

	E.g. the US has a population code of 8 and modifier of 2.4.

	And any population will have people who contribute nothing,
	this formular is not intedent as for robots, but for planets
	who suffer in the long nigth or in the 1116-1130 war.

	Hm civil war was 1700  (if you refer to US history)
	and TL4 is 1900, they would have production of combustion
	machines but no mass production. but its even more likely
	that they\'ll stay at TL3 (they have science but no industry).

	Lets imagine those 10000 people would start at TL8, without
	trade they will have a technological decrease because their
	cars/computers/powerplants will break and they dont have
	the industrial diversity to sustain.

	On the other hand if its posible to trade for them, they
	can buy machines and spare parts and export what they produce,
	in my formulars 40% of their maintaince have to be imported
	which sums up to 816 kCr per month. Not a problem for an
	economy which produces 12 mCr BWP. (Brutto welcome product)

> For that matter, just consider tohe tech level changes this century.
> Wre\'ve gone thru several *without* a 100-fold uncrease in population.

	But the scale of economy incresed in the last hundred years.
	While in 1800 the scale of economy was a big city (population
	5-6) it become nation width in WWI & WWII and continent width
	now. Imho SU economy is broken because they could\'nt sustain
	TL8 without trade they had to step back to TL7 because of
	embargo politics.

Steve, the kind of military paranoid (WRT computer code) already exists.
I used to work for Hewlett-Packard Co., with the Dept. of Defense and
many *big* government contractors (like Lockheed) as customers.  They
bought our technical workstations and our software.  If they had a
problem, they\'d demand support but refuse to tell us what was wrong
(specifically, that is.)  No code samples, no on-site technical service,
no *nothing*!  You damn near had to be telepathic to fix their problems. :^)

questions.

Say a character enlists in the army, as a private (rank E1), and then
passes his injury roll. Say he fails his commission roll, and
automatically moves up to E3 in the first term.

Does the rising ranks described in the \'Enlisted Ranks:\' section on p21
count as promotion for purposes of new skills?

Do NCOs get to roll for promotion in addition to this, and do they
receive extra skills for being promoted?

So in his first term, would this guy get 4 (4 for 4 years), 6 (4 for 4
years, 2 for 2 auto-promotions) or 7 (4 for 4 years, 2 for 2
auto-promotions and 1 if he succeeds the promotion roll) skills?

If the rising in ranks does count for skills, which takes place first
during the second term, the auto-promotion or the commission check?

A couple more unrelated questions:

On some of the Advanced Education options, such as College & Merchant
Academy, the skills available are clusters, shown in bold. My question is
this: does the player get all skills in that cluster, does he pick one, or
does he determine one randomly?

The key on page 183 is unclear on how to mark amber and red travel zones on
to subsector maps. Can anyone enlighten me?

Undoubtedly I will have more questions as I continue reading, and I
appreciate all help. Thanks.

   Most of them, yes. But the F-4D _is_ provided in the game, along with a
lot of other low-tech designs such as the MiG-17, 19, and 21. Desert
Falcons has the early sidewinder and sparrow missiles I need. All I need
is a card for the F-100 and F-105 and I\'m set! (Time to check the

  It\'s like I always said - use Win95, and you\'re _asking_ for trouble;
it doesn\'t have half the safeguards it should. Anybody who gets into this
kind of trouble with windoze and has the nerve to look surprised needs to
be educated about REAL operating systems.

  All flames to dev nul.

Actually those who have been working with DOS (that\'s Dumb Operating 
System), have been dealling with viruses for some time.  Some just as
insidious as what you describe.  And wasn\'t a large portion of the net 
shut down some time around \'91?  

It would be interesting to see what this would do on some other (real)
os.

See?  This is what happens to people that don\'t work exclusively
with UNIX systems?  To paraphrase a cliche, "Friends don\'t let
friends drive DOS."

Yup.  That was the "Morris Internet Worm", which took advantage of a
security hole in the sendmail utility.  Said hole did not exist on
all UNIX platforms (HP workstations, for example, were immune) and
has since been plugged.

This is the one I\'m having the most trouble with as well.  Preliminarily 
(that is, until a better way is found), I\'ve decided to let the player 
specify the target of the called shot (head, hands, whatever), then 
indicate what damage s/he wishes to do (half, double, whatever), and base 
the requirements on that.

But I\'d like a better method. :)

I haven\'t been counting them.  Traditionally, skills were awarded for 
successfully making the promotion roll. Since no roll is involved in the 
automatic promotions enlisted people get, I decided they don\'t receive 
extra skills.  But, that might just be me.

Well, that\'s not the case in my game.  You only roll for promotion if 
you have received a commission.

He would just get four skills (plus any automatic skills).

He can pick one.  Or, if you prefer, you can have the skill be determined 
randomly.  But only one skill is gained.

When making subsector maps, it is traditional to draw a red circle around 
red travel zones, and a yellow (amber) circle around amber zone coded 
systems.

Somebody asked about the Ine Givar, (I deleted the Digest, so
I can\'t look it up) A while back, probably over a year ago
someone else posted about the INe Givar, I saved it but didn\'t
write down their name either. (Do you see a pattern here :) )
So here is what they wrote:
The Ine Givar:

Terrorists or Freedom Fighters?

Yes, one of my fave terrorist organizations.  I know Loren just
said they were deliberately vague on \'em, but I always got the
impression that they were the Pro-Psionic Rights terrorist group of
the Imperium.  (Yeah, I know, but I started this before Red Star
was ever put on the maps)  My initial assumption was based on the
fact that he very moral Zhodani were willing to back them.

As their groups were at least partially composed of psionic adepts
it made the group very subversive.  Consider.  The Imperium would
need to use what knowlege of psionics it had to fight them.  That
means they use the few trained psionics they have.  Now, as the Ine
Givar will loudly claim, they are fighting for the rights of the
very people who are hunting them!

The Ine Givar had legitimate organizations and lobby groups running
around the Imperium (trying not to get lynched) bringing lawsuits
against the Imperial prohibitions on Psionics.  There were all
kinds of peaceful demonstrations:  sit-ins... marches...  voting
drives...  rallies...  fund raising parties...

And of course there\'s Saint Sinn\'s Day on 073:  Sinn was martyred
on the first day of the Psionic suppressions back in the 700s.
Everyone marches in parades, wears something blue, get excedingly

their national day and a great deal of their activity occurs on
that day.  It\'s the one day where most people feel proud of any
ethnic connection they might have to the psionic saint of Esalin.
Of course anyone who wears red (symbolizing the blood of Sinn) may
be subject to harrassment.

I remember one PC who after learning what the Ine Givar were REALLY
up to looked up and said, "Why are we fighting these guys?  Why

difference between Duke BlahBlah of the Slyean Nobility becoming \'of the Third
Imperium\' compared to Mr. LodsaMoney of Grabbit Industries becoming a Duke of
the Empire - especially as the nobility would be conferred on thousands
(milions?) of individuals virtually at once. <<

Well, yes, but it wouldn\'t make that much difference to the said dudes. As their
worlds agreed to join the Imperium, the existing "command structure" would be
slotted into the Nobility commeasurate with their power, influence and clout at
the time. So High King Woderwick of Golgafrincham would add Imperial Planetary
Duke to his list of titles, and his vassals would become Imperial Counts,
Knights, Barons et al.  Eventually, the Imperial titles would replace the old
ones because they\'re more important in the New Order, though the old titles
would get passed down as well - interesting colour to add to PC nobles?

It\'s not like some window cleaner gets sought out and suddenly made a Duke. Then
again, some high-Soc PCs tend to seem that way... <g>

- -Bill <<

I\'d prefer 15s if there were enough available. Ship plans are easier to fit onto
A4 printouts at 15mm!

>> Perhaps for an experience system we could use something along the lines of
Chaosiums where you check a skill that you used during a game and roll to see if
you\'ve improved at the end of the adventure.  It\'s also setup so the more skill
you have the harder the roll is (ie if you have an 85% Sneak, you have to roll
OVER 85%, etc.) I don\'t know what kind of increment you could use since after 5
adventures you could - potentially - go up 5.  Maybe a tenth of a point for slow
progression or a quarter point if you want faster advancement. <<

We use a home-grown system. Every use of a skill earns a "tick". The GM has fiat
on whether a situation merits a tick or not. At the end of an evening\'s game,
players may elect to attempt improvments. The roll is a d100 percentage roll to
get under the number of ticks; each held level of the skill over 1 counts -10%
(eg Level-4 is -30%). Failure loses half ticks for that skill. Success improves
the skill by 1, and removes all ticks for that skill. Skills of 6 or more
(except PSI skills) require 10 "ticks" to earn 1.

Good roleplaying that session is rewarded with a few extra ticks for pre-defined
hobby skills. These can include physical attributes - the MT bonus is used as
the skill, and 5 successful throws = +1 Stat.

The rolling at the end of the evening isn\'t enomously realistic but it avoids
interruption of the gameflow and cuts off multiple attempts at a stroke.

Long passages of time (frex, trainig sabbaticals) can be simulated by 3,4,5D
worth of ticks, either on the skill being trained or assigned at the player\'s
whim.

Of course, this is all made much, much easier by the database I keep of all PCs
which will kick out  a preprinted "tick sheet" with the skills, levels, and 100
numbered boxes per skill for each character at the drop of a thing you wear on
your head. In fact, my players now have that sheet at the top of the sheaf that
constitutes a "character sheet" in my game... But a sheet of A4 will do fine.

Hmnn, basically plausible, but it breaks down at higher levels. (I don\'t have T4

this seems fine. But if Vanna has had vast experience and long training in the
skill, and has a level of 4 or 5, and _still_ the eternal student over there

educated one has _never actually done_ a survey but has a related skill that

of success it breaks down even further!

I know what you mean. When me\'n\'my buddy started gaming back in \'82, we started
visiting Games Workshop. Ah. I know what you\'re thinking. No, then it was a
_real_ games shop. Tucked away in John Dalton St in Manchester, smallish shop,
glass cases with leads on show - you sang out the numbers and got \'em in a
little paper bag like an old-fashioned sweetshop. All sortza different games,
and run by _gamers_, not sales-suits or wage-slaves. We became regulars, and
copped for the same sort of freebies as you - I still have my White Dwarf
somewhere, and the Dwarf with No Name... When the first CT Alien Modules came
out (GW had moved to the Arndale by then but were still a good store), they
reserved copies of Zhodani, Droyne and Solomani for us - and hung on til ten
past five as we tore through the rush hour on our motorbikes to pick \'em up!

I still shake my head with great sadness when I see the modern GW stores,
exclusively dedicated to ripping kiddies with their mediocre Warhamster stuff,
and diverting hordes of them away from real roleplaying forever.

Only one shop - the Model Shop - in the Manchester area that I can think of
carries any RPG at all, though there\'s a good 2-H shop out in Merseyside that
Andy Lily put us onto, and a model shop in Warrington has a few odds and ends
(they still have 101 vehicles and FSSI!). Even the London Virgin Megastore\'s
range has plummetted. I don\'t know about the States, but over here in Blighty,

Nasty. Basically, if anyone\'s close enough to see or smell they\'re in big
trouble. Liquid H escaping into the live zone will be damn unpleasant. It\'s kept
under pressure and at I-dunno-how-many degrees below zero, so a fair amount will
flash from liquid to vapour instantly - expanding as it does so. Another word
for this is "explosion" <g>. This will also flash-freeze objects in areas of the
ship involved, so screens will explode/crack, metal will become biscuit-brittle,
flesh crumble, etc. Any electronics in the area, whether ship systems or
portable equipment, will probably be well buggered as boards crack and
transistor legs shatter (or the equivalent in Trav tech). Laser rifles will be
destroyed as the laser tube explodes; CPR firearms will be unproofed and
probably break under the stress of their own recoil springs. Different materials
would flex different amounts under the enormous temperature drop, and composite
constructions would probably splay apart. Uh, that\'s most things. Oh, yes, doors
would probably jam shut, warped or coldwelded or both, so rescue attempts would
be largely futile.

Sound would basically be "bang!" and possibly a steam-hose "whooosh". Smells
would originate from the damaged stuff around, though most (like humans)
wouldn\'t start to pong til they thawed out.

It beggars belief that starship fuel tanks are just one big tin can; they\'ll be
lots of cells with dampers and shutoff valves. The release of all a ship\'s fuel
into the live zone would probably kill everyone on board. For simplicity\'s sake,
I\'d rate your incident as a "Fuel-1" combat hit and treat accordingly.

You sure know how to have your NPCs make an exit!

     ==== Charles said: ========
     
     I\'m not sure I like your alternative.  There\'s no chance of missing 
     your main target but hitting secondary ones.  The "two attacks" rule 
     is simple, but I prefer the "main target and n adjacent targets" rule. 
     It\'s simple, (reasonably) realistic, and elegant.
     
     ===========================
     
     Yeah, I agree.  I still haven\'t come up with something I\'m entirely 
     happy with.  In fact I don\'t think I\'ve ever been completely happy 
     with the autofire system in *any* rules (I guess Phoenix Command comes 
     closest for accuracy, but... ;-)).  I\'ll probably stick with the T4 
     rules, since, as you say, it\'s simple, (reasonably) realistic & 
     elegant.
     
     
     3) Difficulty vs DM\'s
     
     ====Charles said:===========
     
        I also agree that they shouldn\'t mix up their modifiers.  Keep the 
     targets constant and change the diff or vice versa, not both.   
        Does anyone else like the sneakiness of making DM stand for
     "difficulty modifier" instead of "die modifier"?  I thought that was
     pretty cute.  At first when I was skimming, I was confused by the n-
     targets with the +n DM\'s to make the task easier.  I kept thinking 
     "but if you add to the dice,that makes it harder!"  Then I thought 
     "oh, you must add to the target, but then the mods should be called 
     TMs for \'target modifier\'."  I went looking for a section on DMs, 
     praying IG hadn\'t goofed up something so fundamental and grinned 
     broadly upon reading of "difficulty modifiers".  Real cute. 
     
     =============================
     
     Hmm, I didn\'t spot the Die/Difficulty Modifier bit when I first 
     skimmed through.  A quick look in the index and I had the page 
     references, though.  (Wow, a useful index in a RPG!  I\'ve used it 3 or 
     4 times now and I\'ve always found the entry I wanted straight away.  
     Mucho kudos to IG; if you think I\'m making a big deal about this, try 
     looking something up in the index of any White Wolf rule book).  Yeah, 
     cute!
     
     
     4) Called shots
     
     ====Charles accused me of saying a lot [;-)], change the subject & 
     said:=======
     
     I haven\'t gotten to called shots yet.  My beef is with the snapshot 
     rule.  Excuse me, but _no_ range modifier based on weapon type?  Give 
     me a break!  I could certainly see reduced modifiers, but a rifle is 
     going to have way better chances hitting something at range than a 
     pistol, no matter whether you take careful aim or not.  Please tell me 
     I\'ve misinterpreted this rule.  Otherwise I\'m simply going to make 
     snap shots one or two difficulty levels higher than aimed shots and 
     always use the rule for aimed shots... 
     
     =======================
     
     Initially I cringed when I saw this rule, but on second thoughts I 
     think it\'s probably quite realistic (IMHO, of course ;-)).  Remember, 
     characters are moving, pointing and firing when they snapfire.  No 
     sights are used.  Now I don\'t know how realistic this is in combat 
     shooting (do you completely ignore your sights, or is it simply a 
     matter of coolness under fire [i.e. I might shoot an attacker without 
     using the sights, but Mr. ex-special forces would be walking round 
     with the butt of his SMG firmly in his shoulder]?), but if you aren\'t 
     using the sights then there shouldn\'t be any difference.  In fact, 
     pistols might be slightly more accurate than rifles \'cause you are 
     effectively just pointing your hand at the target, rather than trying 
     to manouvre a long gun with two hands.
     
     Basically, I think that the inaccuracy due to the weapon (barrel 
     length, bullet flight, etc) will be insignificant compared to the 
     skill of the firer when no proper aim is taken.  Up to a point.  At 
     some range, the inaccuracies of a pistol will be more significant than 
     the skill of the person firing it.  At this point, difficulty should 
     go way up (or should I say, you get a large -ve DM ;-)).
     Most pistols (and the SMG, hmm...) have a range of V Short(15m), 
     magnum revolvers are Short (45m) and rifles are generally Medium 
     (150m).  I think I\'ll look up my Phoenix Command tables and see what 
     ranges some typical weapons become dependant on the inherant 
     inaccuracies of the weapon (I\'m guessing it will be about double the 
     above figures).

This seems to be the trend here as well.  Our local hobby store keeps a few

On the other hand, All these "grey with details" and "low visibility colors"

Nice, bright paint colors help identify ships. My military fleet is Shell

Well, not to toot my own horn again, but the one I wrote runs fine.
I also fixed it so that it now works under Netscape 3 and IE 3.

By my rough timings, the viewer applet takes ~45 seconds to load
(486/50, 16 m RAM, ISDN line) and under 5 seconds to generate a new 
subsector map. The map shows hexes, planets, starport ratings and
gas giants. Pretty simple, but I doubt that adding stuff would
slow it down much. Oh, it\'s Win95 too. I\'ve run it on  some
stock Sparc 4s and 5s and it runs great on those.

I have a stupid question.   I didn\'t notice the \'Enlisted Ranks\' Section

I *have* noticed that lots of the new RPGs are very rules-light.  The

Yes...  To outsiders, they\'re terrorists.  In their minds, they\'re 
freedom fighters.  Isn\'t this usually the way?  I guess the best 
answer is take your pick...they\'re vague enough in canon to be 
whatever you want them to be.  I\'ve chosen to have them be both, 
depending on your point of view...  Then again, I love creating moral 
dilemmas for PC\'s, so this is probably just a manifestation of my 
tendencies...

Actually, canon suggests that they stopped backing them after the 5th 
Frontier War.  Probably a marriage of convenience more than anything, 
after all the Zhodani also align with the Sword Worlds and Vargr, 
neither of which have a high opinion of Psionics either...

<a long, and very interesting take on the Ine Givar SNIPPED>

Canon on the subject is vague enough that they are basically whatever 
you want them to be.  Your take is definitely different than mine, 
but interesting...

I always looked at them as a red herring, a much smaller group than 
they would like you to believe.  Being the PLO or IRA of their time 
(at least in visibility), I think a lot of acts of terrorism that 
could probably be better attributed to others would often be blamed 
on them instead...  I saw the Zhodani thing as a "enemy of my enemy 
is my friend" sort of thing...

I viewed them as kind of a nihilist, anti-interstellar government 
group, with some radical political leanings (kind of 58th century, 
quasi-Marxist leanings).

I basically had their general criticisms of the Imperium being:

1. The laissez-faire attitude of the Imperium towards member worlds
2. Opposition to Imperial involvement in interstellar affairs in 
general, and the Frontier Wars in particular...
3. Opposition to the Imperial Feudal system in general, and the 
existence of nobility in particular...

I had them doing things like blowing up starport facilities, 
maintenance yards, office buildings for interstellar commerce related 
companies, assassination attempts on the local nobility, etc.

I left their aims intentionally ambiguous, because I don\'t think they 
would have thought these things through as well...  Since I had them 
being an anti-interstellar government group, I made it even more 
ambiguous as to what they were by making their aims, and methods 
slightly different from world to world...

Made it more of a challenge for the PC\'s in the 1 campaign I did with 
them to figure out their MO that way...because they really hadn\'t 
thought it all the way through either...

Dewclaw is a claw that grows in the middle of the Aslan "hand", 
literally where the palm is on a human.  Like Terran cats, the Aslan 
have claws which can retract or reveal itself in defense.  The dewclaw 
acts as a short bladed weapon in combat (don\'t have the exact stats on 
me at the moment), and the Aslan learn to use it in place of the 
usual brawling skill.  Control of the dewclaw retraction is 
SEMI-voluntary.  Usually, the Aslan control when it reveals or hides 
in the palm.  Sometimes, during times of great personal stress, they 
lose the ability, and it reveals itself automatically.

It is often the weapon of choice in Aslan duels...

Skolnik says it best.  "Increasing the radar energy in the direction of the
jammer in the hope of increasing the radar echo power above the jamming
noise is called burnthrough.  This may be accomplished with reserve
transmitter power or by dwelling longer in the direction of the jammer.
Dwelling longer on a target reduces the data rate, and thus can degrade the
overall radar performance.  A significant reduction in data rate generally
is not desirable.  Dependence on burnthrough as a major ECCM tactic is
questionable.  It should be used where cost-effective and where the
reduction in data rate is tolerable."

Other points.
"Multiple radars viewing the same coverage in a coordinated manner can
provide some benefit against a jammer since it is unlikely that jamming
power can be distributed uniformly in space.  With netting of radars, those
radars with less jamming can provide target data for radars with more
jamming.  Multiple radar sites also allow a jammer to be located by
triangulation when main-beam jamming denies a direct measurement of range.
This may be a satisfactory tactic for one or a few jammers, but
triangulation cannot be used with a large number of jammers because of the
generation of ghost targets.  N jammers can produce N^2 - N ghost targets
when two radars attempt triangulation."

This is all from the book "Introduction to Radar Systems," 2nd ed., 1980, by
Merril I. Skolnik.

back!  and the far trader!  and the subsidized merchant!  and, and...
well, you get the idea.  Frankly, seeing those new illustrations is a
bit like walking into a chruch and discovering that the standard design
for a crucifix had been re-do: Christ now is always seen wearing a
leisure suit. :^/

As for Blair Reynolds, I know that he\'s just finished doing the new
cover art for Pagan Publishing\'s new _Delta_Green_ supplement for
_Call_of_Cthulhu_.  Beyond that, I\'m not sure.

In my dream version of Traveller, we\'d have all the artists that DGP used
for their Alien Modules (_Cogs_n_Dogs_ and _Cats_n_Rats_), we\'d have an
Imperium the runs up to around the end of the 5th Frontier War, and I
don\'t really *care* what rules set we use, as long as it has one of the
better task resolution systems and a decent model for vehicle/ship design.

But I digress... :^)

BTW, someone else said it recently and I\'ll second the motion:

"Brzzk for Emperor!!"

What first tipped off the Tolkien estate to copyright infringement in D&D
was the fact that the first editions of D&D had _Hobbit_ as a character
race.  A friend of mine owns a first edition of D&D, so I know this to be
fact...  The Tolkien Estate didn\'t have to look any further than that to
fire up the laywers into sending them a letter.  I hadn\'t heard that they
had enfringed on Ent\'s as well.  But then again I don\'t get much chance to
look through his set (it\'s worth $o much ca$h!!!)  I know that after the
first (couple of) edition(s) they were refered to as Tre-Ent\'s.

While there is ample "fairy tale" evidence for Dwarf\'s, Elves, Goblin\'s,
Talking Tree\'s, etc.  Hobbit and Ent\'s are Tolkien\'s names and hence
protected.  Just like I can\'t name my Super-Spy character James Bond or
Matt Helm in a novel I write.

I don\'t know if this incident or the Cthulu/Elric incidents ever went to
court...  Most of the time a simple letter is enough to get people to stop
infringement.  Sometimes if the party who\'s property was infringed wishes
to extract damages it will be necessary to at least go through the legal
motions of sueing in order to force an acceptable out of court settlement.
But it rarely comes down to an actual trial.

I\'m not sure but Dave Arneson\'s case may have actually gone to trial.  I
heard that Gary Gygax\'s Dangerous Journeys, published by GDW, was in some
legal difficulty from T$R at one point.  Something about Gygax doing some
of the work while still at T$R (what I heard, may not be actual)...  It
seems that it was discountinued rather abruptly, but that could have been
GDW\'s fincial difficulties...

    'body' => 'After having watched the discussions of Year 0 and the role and nature =
of the nobility in Traveller I took some time to study feudalism as it =
has existed in our own history.  Here follows a few opinions on the =
discussion.

I believe that a monolithic nobility all serving at the pleasure of the =
Emperor is not as strong a realm for adventure and conflict as Traveller =
deserves, especially in Year 0.
The history of feudalism and nobility is filled with divided loyalties, =
subinfeudation and the richness of history that extends from such a =
situation.

1.  An example of subinfeudation and divided loyalties from a current =
campaign set in the post-virus era follows:

Lord Bertrand Charles Worchester is a Baron of the Imperial Court at =
Mora serving without a fief at the bloody edge of the newly reformed =
Imperium in Vland Sector. He is a Baron by the grace of the newly =
proclaimed Emperor (who most recently was simply Regent.) Before the =
Emperor made him a Baron he was a Knight Commander of the Order of =
Imperial Regency and therefore sworn to the Sovereign of the Order (who =
is not the Emperor.) He operates in Vland Sector which is the =
jurisdiction of a Duke sworn to the Archduke of Rylanor. The Duke was =
recently assassinated and if they Duchess, his wife, names him a Count =
and provides Lord Worchester with a fief then he will then be sworn to =
her also.

What do we have? A man sworn to the Sovereign of a Order, the Emperor, =
and soon perhaps, to a Duchess. A situation ripe for intrigue, conflict =
and adventure. Also a situation which mirrors the conflicting loyalties =
of our own western medieval history.

2.  A comment about what this would mean for the fighting forces of the =
Imperium.

Most Traveller materials take for granted a monolithic Imperial Navy and =
Marine.  One of the duties of a feudal lord was to raise and maintain =
troops to serve his liege in times of conflict. If we take the =
historical situation and extend it to the Traveller Universe we would =
then have the naval units and marine forces of the Duchy of Park called =
to service of the emperor. These forces would include the ships and men =
raised by Count Parquad and Baron Nivar all wearing distinctive insignia =
and flying the colors of their liege.

Just some thoughts.

Well I got my copy from a shop here in Norway about two or three weeks
after the 
first ones got theirs in USA, so I guess they should be available in
Great Britain.
The good news here from Norway is that the 4-four-copies was sold out in
one hour.

I want to apolegize to IG for my sceptecism toward T4 at one point and
say that I 
think T4 looks good so far. I haven\'t read the hole book, some parts
I\'ve just 
look through. I like the artwork, except for the all-terrain vehicle and
the weapons
(but that has been said allready by many people on this list :-).

As some of you might know I maintain an alternate setting for Traveller
on the page
http://www.ifi.uio.no/~tommyg/Traveller.html  The setting is named The
Terran
Confederation. I have know been made aware that there is a time periode
for Traveller
that is named exactly the same. I just want to point out that my setting
has nothing
to do with IG\'s offical (atleast thats what I guess it will be)
timeperiode. If anybody
thinks I should change the name, feel free to mail me your opinion or
voice here
at the list.

	I\'ve come up with my own, inspired by CT and the MT task duration
rules. I basically tell my players that all all combat is resolved
simultaneously. When this causes a problem, for instance when two
characters both shoot and kill each other, it can become an issue as to
who fired first. I then have both players roll 3 dice and subtract their
skill levels; lower score goes first. If both scores are equal, then I
rule that the original result (both characters are killed) stands.
	This system has some potential for both chaos and abuse, but neither
has ever been a problem with my players. 
	It can add a delicious amount of suspense to certain die rolls...

Just keep the \'punk\' element out of it, and you have a basic industrial-espionage 
scenario. Then again, what made Wall Street so vulnerable to program-trading 
manipulation in _DoH_ was that the various trading houses used the _same_ mathematical 
models of market behavior to drive the expert system AIs. If the models are the same, 
the implementations are not so critical that they might be the targets of industrial 
espionage . . . unless the adventure is limited to a low-tech world where these 
techniques are _just_ being implemented.

He\'s now _Representitive_ Randy Cunningham, (R-Calif) now, isn\'t he? I managed to meet  
Colonel Pappy Boyington (_Baa Baa Black Sheep_) a _long_ time ago, as well as a 
Luftwaffe (WW2) fighter pilot named Eichel. Both are strange tales . . . .

That\'s right . . . _Desert Falcons_ was a b*tch to find. From what I 
understand, JD published the Vietnam stuff in another game _The Speed of Heat_. The 
cards in that game look _a Lot_ like AS. I don\'t know if the Thud is in there; but if it 
is and TSoH is compatible with AS, you may have a campaign!

Now if only I had the music to all those neat songs ("The sexual life of the camel . . .

The roll for promotion is for commissioned officers.

4 for 4 years. Enlisted promotions don\'t count for skills; only rolled promotions do.

If the character is non-commissioned, he gets the auto-promotions "at the start of the 
term" (this is per T4). This is for terms after the first. In subsequent terms, he will 
auto-promote before checking for commissioning. If he is commisssioned, then check for 
_officer_ promotion.

I allow characters to pick an appropriate skill.

Traditionally, Red zones are completely encircled with a bold line and Amber Zones are

Ghods . . . . makes me glad to have Doug and company here. Doug\'s a businessman _and_ a 
gamer/modeller/anime freak/comics fan/card collector who hires _other_ likeminded folks, 
not game-ignorant weenies. He tosses so many freebies at me it isn\'t funny (like the 
whole run of Ken Carpenter\'s _Stroke and Dagger_) and stays open late to accomodate me

I\'ve never been in a GW store, but I can relate to how you feel. GW\'s arrogance tops 
that of T$R. GW\'s practice of referring to "The Hobby" as I\'ve known and loved it for 
thirty years as "The Games Workshop Hobby" makes me sick. Not even T$R, at the depths it 
sunk to in the early 80s, ever exhibited this brand of hubris. It\'s gotten so bad that 
most of my friends here will not play third edition "Whore-whammer." The vacuum 
coefficient of Third ed Whorewhammer is intolerable (it sucks HARD); it\'s the classic 
Marketing-Department-driven \'game.\' GW is to gaming that Domino\'s is to pizza -- 
corporate crapola.

 Sounds like GW is _murdering_ it in the UK. Maybe it\'s time to define "The Hobby" -- 
roleplaying, wargaming and boardgaming -- as specifically excluding GW and all it\'s 
works. After all, GW\'s own hype calls it "The Games Workshop Hobby." Use that when you 
talk to the indie shops! There\'s "The Hobby" -- gaming as you know and love it -- and 
there\'s "The Games Workshop Hobby," aka The Evil Coroprate Entity aka 
T$R-with-a-Brit-accent. I suport the shops that support The Hobby here in the Armpit of 
California; I\'m sure you\'re doing the same.

They do produce some pretty nice miniatures, though.  And some good
fiction.  I just don\'t agree with their outlandish pricing, rules which
appear only as "interpretations" within fictional text in the sidebars of
their rulebooks (ie: no hard, written rules like Avalon Hill), and the fact
that they completely replace their games with new versions that are in no
way compatible with previous releases.  Oh yeah, and the fact that you can
only use their miniatures during their own conventions.  Geez.

How do they survive?  "In your face" marketing aimed at new gamers and
die-hard GW fans (and not those of us who know when to get out of GW\'s
particular niche of the hobby)-- not to mention an erie cult following.
That\'s it... GW is a cult!

GW has a head office in Baltimore and many large cities in the US & Canada
have GW stores (that sell *only* GW stuff).  Some game stores are licensed
affiliates of GW, which basically means that they carry a complete line of
GW stuff in addition to their other stocked items.

Grenadier produced a set of table-top rules for their own miniature line a
year or two ago but it kind of got lost under the foot of GW.  They also
produced a Companion shortly afterwards.  Something tells me that you might
get a better game out of Grenadier (who produced miniatures well before the
rules) than GW (which produces games to sell their miniatures).

    'month' => '09',
    'topic' => 'T4 vs. CT',
    'body' => 'Hi, 

I bought T4 last week, and have been enthusiastically reading it
since then. I\'ve seen several reviews of the new rules on this
list, but none have been from the point of view of a die-hard CT
hold-out (at least, not that I know of). So I thought I\'d add my
own $0.02 worth regarding Traveller\'s present incarnation.

Let me start off by saying that I love just about everything about
the new rules. I\'ll talk a little bit about why I like them, and
then I\'ll give an overview of the differences between T4 and CT.

I love T4 for two reasons. One, the new rules have very much the feel of
CT.  A task system has been introduced which was obviously inspired by
MT\'s very excellent task system, but has been altered to maintain more
of CT\'s stronger reliance on attributes. Like MT\'s task system, T4\'s
gives the referee a more managible structure to work with (compared to
CT\'s often ad hoc rulings), while allowing more flexibility than MT had
room for. I think a more opportune balance has been struck here.

Two, the background, while still sparse, has got me excited. From
the early days of the first publication of Supplement 3, "The
Spinward Marches," many people have complained about CT\'s lack of
opportunity for exploration and about the 3rd Imperium\'s
omnipresence. MT tried to address this problem by shattering the
Imperium. I think that the present solution ---- adventuring "in the
past" ---- is a more satisfying one. It allows for exploration and
war in a growing society, rather than a decaying one. All the decay
following the Rebellion was just too depressing for me to want to
adventure there.

Also, I\'m happy to see support for the old Spinward Marches milieu
in the adventure "Exit Visa," which was included in the rule book
as an example for newbies (and an exercise in the new task system
for oldbies) and set circa the year 1105. (But it is easily
transportable to any campaign.)

Despite T4\'s success in maintaining the "feel" of both CT and MT,
when it comes down to gritty details, the new rules can be quite
different from the old. I think that almost all of the changes were
for the better, and reflected the fact that the old rules could be
quite inadequate in some respects (for instance, the discrepancy
between the abilities of characters rolled up using Book 2 compared
to those using the "expanded character generation" rules of books 4
through 7). Still, these changes need to be addressed for those who
desire continuity within an ongoing campaign.

The biggest rules change was the character generation system. All
the old Book 2 careers are in place (with some well thought-out
additions) and they use a smilar concept. (You roll for enlistment,
survival, commission, promotion, re-enlistment, skills, etc.) But
the new attribute-oriented task system requires that skills be at
higher levels in order to make a big difference compared to the
attribute. So characters generated with the T4 system will
seriously out-class any old CT character.

And this problem can\'t be solved by a referee merely insisting that
the old character generation systems still be used. Old CT
characters will find that they may (depending on their attributes)
have a much harder time performing actions in the new task system
than in the old ad hoc system.

So your old CT characters will need to be beefed up somehow. The
simplest (and crudest) way to do this may be to multiply all skill
levels by 3 for Book2 characters and by 2 for Books4-7 characters.
Or you can allow your characters more rolls on the new skill
tables, and retcon the discrepancies. A good referee with the
desire to change systems should be able to come up with a
conversion that both he and his players like. I think it\'s well
worth the effort.

The other Big Change was in the starship construction rules.
Traveller up till now has had four not-so-compatable rule systems
for starships: Book2, Book5, MT, and FFS. Now it has five, the QSDS
system in T4. The new system is based (too bad for me) on my least
favorite of the previous four: FFS. But some very well thought out
alterations to it have been made to make the ships designed by it
to be very CTish in nature. The new USP is much better than either
High Guard\'s (too vague) or MT\'s (too cluttered).

The ships produced by the system and included in the rulebook are
all oldies-but-goodies. I look forward to seeing a large collection
of pre-designed starships come out soon.

But as far as designing ships myself goes: I think I\'ll continue to
use High Guard. High Guard is just too simple and elegant a system
for me to abandon ---- I can design a ship in my head in five
minutes. QSDS is not too complicated, but It does depend on a lot
of charts, and even with those charts I\'d need 15 minutes or so
crank out a quickie.

I say this with some regret, because a lot of imagination and skill
went into writing QSDS and it really shows. But I don\'t see myself
needing the added level of detail, so I can\'t see what I\'d gain by
abandoning High Guard.

This is my ONLY complaint about the new game.

I\'m going to try to come up with a way to convert all my old High
Guard USP\'s to the new T4 USP, unless, of course, Derek Wildstar
has already given some thought to that. I\'d appreciate all the help
I can get.

Cheers,

  After attempting to create ships based upon T4, I was left with some
minor feelings of disquiet.  The statistics for the Patrol Cruiser does
not match was is given for the "standard" ship building rules.  Does
anyone know if this is the result of the Patrol Cruiser being built by the
upcoming starship book rules?  If the ship should have been built using
the standard rules from Traveller 4th Edition, then the hull values
themselves are off in that the Structure value should either be 12 or 16,
not 14.  Also, I noted that there was a faulty hull volume rating for the
Patrol Cruiser in that it was listed as a 200 ton ship, and yet, the
listed volume was for a 400 ton ship.

  On a related topic, how does T4 rate rooms?  I noticed that the ship
description allowed for X crew, and Y passengers.  Does this mean that
there are X+Y staterooms, or that there is .5*X+Y staterooms?

Here\'s an easy thing for us to do. I\'m surprised it hasn\'t been done
already. (If it has, I would love to have a look at it!)

Write up an idea with the same format as 76 patrons (shown below). Send
your idea to me at "daniel_t@gate.net" with the subject "TML Patron". At
the end of the month, I will publish all the patrons on a web page!

================================================================================
Format for TML Patrons:

Recommended number of players (2-6, 5-12, 9+)

Patron Type     Required Skills:        Required Equipment:

Players Information:
    Include a short history, set-up the situation, mention what the patron
will do for the players and what (s)he expects from them.

Referee\'s Information:
    Describe at least 3 different modifications to the above situation and
number them.

Concept by: (put your name and e-mail address here!)

Copyright notice: Unless you specify otherwise I will assume the following:
You will allow me to edit it for length and/or format and publish it in a

    'body' => 'Hello Folks,
  I was wondering if anyone might like a go at this concept: Email Player
Character...

  Burke Reisling: up and coming executive in the Sternmetals
Megacorporation.  As a mid-level executive, he feels that his talents are
wasted.  He would like a chance at the big stuff where he could be a VP in
charge of some division located somewhere in the lower extremities of the
Spinward Marches sector.  He believes he has found his ticket, namely: an
unnamed planet in the Trojan Reaches on the other side of the imperium
border.  It was surveyed quickly by a scout team.  They failed to find the
Tantalum deposit situated on the planet\'s surface.  As fate would have it,
it looks very rich on the surface, but has been determined to be limited
by competent geologists.  Using funds "relocated" by Burke, something to
the turn of roughly 750 Mcr, he is organizing a bogus colonization effort.
The colonizers are from 3 heavily populated worlds, and come under three
major classifications:

1) highly paid technicians - 800 total
2) high-risk criminals who were given the choice emmigrate or incarcerate
3) welfare "scum" who are untrained, and used to welfare programs

Group #2 totals up to 4200 men/women, while group #3 totals 20,000.  The
governments paid a bounty on these undesirables if Burke would transport
them off planet.  Of course, Assurances were required in order to get the
bounty to the effect that the colonization would be properly supported,
and done far away from the homeworlds.  To this end, a large Transport
holding 24,200 low berths were required (or, alternatively, one transport
is required to make a couple of "runs" to get all 25,000 colonists).  On
average, the amount of money being spent on the colonists is equal to
30,000 credits...

  Now for the behind the scenes stuff:  Burke has managed to get his hands
on a stolen Anagathic cargo lot.  Neither he, nor the "pirate" knew that
the batch was an experimental batch with a need for clinical trials until
too late.  It acts like an Anagathic, but after a few months of use, it
begins to act like a poison instead (something about trace impurities
impossible to filter out).  In any event, he has hired some personnel with
the promise of 10 years worth of Anagathics should the "experts" sign on
for a five year stint as colonizer organizers.  Currently hired are two
scouts with 44 years of experience between them, an Ex-Army officer who
joined the Imperial Security organization (sort of an FBI for the
Imperium), and an ex-Marine washed out 2nd LT. (after all, 20 years in the
service, an no promotions worth mentioning).  The scouts are there to
start the colony, and the other two are there to keep the riff-raff in
line.  What Burke doesn\'t know is that one of the "police" experts is
really a retiring Imperial Security- that is, until now <grin>.

1) Burke\'s plan is to start the colony outside Imperial Boundries.

2) Burke has a slush fund that should Sternmetal find out about, will wash
him out of the company.

3) Burke wants a higher position in the company, and will do just about
anything to get it short of murder (although he doesn\'t have a problem
with some other person doing the dirty deed...)

4) Burke has a plan where the PC\'s will be withdrawing the money for
colony expenses.  He is paying a bank employee to watch the fund and
report the money as it is being withdrawn.  In conjunction with reports
that the PC\'s are expected to file, he hopes to catch the PC\'s in an act
of embezzlement - and can hold the threat of legal action over them.

5) The Tantalum deposit on the planet will be Burke\'s ticket to higher
authority, should the colony succeed.  It is a known fact that the mine
will play out, and that the "boom-town" atmosphere will bust rather
quickly.  At such a time, Burke intends to deliberately make some "errors"
and look like he is in hot water, and then sell the playing out mine to
whomever will buy it - an unrealistic prices <he he he>.

  What are the thoughts of the people of this list, and are there any who
would like to assume the role of Burke?  Assuming that there are at least
two who are going to be interested, could you send an email detailing
Burke a little bit more (ie character stats, skills, and other plans that
you would do were you playing Burke for real).  This way, I can chose the
"real" Burke...

One more Thing:  I am running a GURPS atlantean Campaign every other week,
and a Traveller Campaing opposite the Atlantean Campaign.  This means that
you would be contacted roughly every two weeks.  Of course, Burke could be
involved with other things besides the colony scenario (like piracy and
such - after all, where did he get the stolen Anagathics from? <grin>).

When changing careers, can a character apply to one he has already served 
in, and can he apply to one he has been previously turned down from?

When mustering out, do all terms served count, or only those served in the 
current career?

When mustering out benefits include the yacht or lab ship, does the 
character have to pay for them, like the free trader, or does he get it 
free, like the scout?

The last sentence of the Retirement section of the mustering out benefits 
reads:
"Retirement pay is not available to characters who have served in the 
Scout or another service."
What does this mean? By services does it mean military forces (Army, Navy, 
etc.)?

All help appreciated.

What you say makes sense.  I plan on getting it pretty-formatted by my 
wife once it is finished.  It would be available in ASCII, WP, and Word 
formats.  Other formats, if necessary, will have to be translated by 
someone else. :)

BTW, RSSC has been renamed to "The Role-Playing Ship Combat System," or RPSC 
System (or just RPSC).  Why, you ask?   :)

Well, Eris and I started out making a truly Rediculously Simple Combat 
System.  Range bands, no hexes.   Limited weapons (lasers, and maybe 
missiles).  Basically, not a lot of complicating options.  Oh, and an 
emphasis on characters as opposed to equipment.

As we got into it though, and slung proposals back and forth, it started 
to become more complex.  

Then several folks joined in (including Derek Wildstar, Merrick 
Burkhardt, and James Garriss) and it started becoming even more 
complex..  We added hex-based movement and lots of complicated options.  

More recently, Allen Shock, Bruce Allen Macintosh, Larry Hadley, and 
several others have joined in, contributing comments, questons, and 
criticism.  Allen contributed some rules proposals as well.  It became 
even more complex.

By that time, we had a really good wargame.  Which is fine, but it isn\'t 
what we set out to do!

Finally we all realized we had totally abandoned the original purpose.  
We\'d created The Complex Space Combat System without even trying, in a 
sense. :)  

So, it was back to the drawing board.  I re-wrote the entire thing in two 
evenings (Tuesday and Wednesday of this week), taking the core ideas as 
contributed by all of us over the weeks, but softening the edges.  Late 
last night/early this morning, the folks involved with the project 
responded to my changes with further changes, helping to pull it further 
away from the wargame archetype.

So, at this point we have a system that is rapidly becoming a 
role-playing method of playing out space combat.  Thus, the name change.  

I had planned to post a beta-test version of it to TML after this weekend, 
but we\'ll see how it goes.

Stay tuned. :)

Now consider that you can kill *everyone* in China, the CIS, India, and
large portions of Africa, Latin America, and it would have *no* effect
on our tech level, because none of those places contributes anything
*necessary* for maintaining our tech level.

And don\'t forget that we are doing this with *no* trade. If you want to
claim that we have trade, then you\'d better start looking at the
population of industrial *regions*, not the world population.

Huh? You need that to take *cash* profits. But you can keep playing the
trade without it. And as long as one corner is at "your" tech level,
and willing to "trade" for repairs/upgrades on your ship, you\'re fine.

Better check your facts. Rum is made from *molasses*, which is a
*byproduct* of sugar production. That\'s why the rum was generally
produced *in* the West Indies!

Ever hear of the SGT York Divisional Anti-Aircraft weapon?  Had the best
weapon control software in the world, designed to lock onto the whirling
blades of Soviet helicopters.

First time they rolled it out for the brass, the damn machine ignored the
two drone helicopters hovering right in front of it, and instead engaged the
exhaust fan of a near-by latriene!

The moral of the story.  Never trust a computer to do a soldier\'s work.  A
M1-A2 may have computers tracking everything but how many dirty letters the
driver has got from his girlfriend, but it is still the crew that picks the
targets and engages them.

Actually, TSR got jumped on *several* times and it was *quite* early on.

First case I know of was their Pre-D&D product (which is referred to
several times in D&D) "Warriors of Mars". The Burroughs estate was
*not* happy. (I\'d love to have even a Xerox of the book though)

Then came the Tolkien estate noticing "Ents", "Hobbits" and one other
thing I can\'t recall. But that was *long* before TSR started going
after other people. The printing of the original books had the changes
by the mid 70s. 

Next was the Gods, Demigods and Heroes booklet referring to fictional
dieties without permission. And they did it again with the first
edition of Dieties and Demigods (Elric, Cthulhu Mythos, etc).

I think that was the *last* time they were stupid enough to not check
the copyright status of things.

Those involved in producing the goods, or in supporting those who
produce them. So miners and farmers count, but only the ones needed for
the industrial areas. Plus the "semi-closed" areas like China don\'t
count.

Remove the "street people" and the the folks who\'ve given up looking

Sure, there are always children, retired, students, etc. But a society
that *needs* everyone just to keep things running (which *is* the

Comparing economies that "grew" from scratch with ones that were set up
at a higher tech level doesn\'t work very well. We\'ve got lots of areas
that have *never* been at anything much above medieval level, if that
high. 

A colony will start out at a given tech level, and only drop to very
low tech levels when they get *forced* to. And if it\'s a true *colony*
as opposed to some sort of outpost, at least the basics for becoming
self-sufficient are going to be a priority.

Consider Australia. What\'s the population? And how much stuff do they

The technical term used was "Divisional Air Defense," or "DIVAD."  And it

Ah, now *this* gets into a fascinating area.  The concept Doug\'s getting 
at here is "Human in the loop," or HITL in acronymese.  The US armed 
forces are much, *much* happier when any given weapon system has a human 
in the primary decision-making role when it comes to firing the weapon -- 
which only makes sense.  Alas, on the modern battlefield, the time and 
sensory constraints are becoming tight enough that it\'s sometimes 
impractical to put a human in the loop.

An excellent example is the Phalanx point-defense system, which is
intended as a last-ditch counter to cruise missile attacks against naval
vessels.  If I\'m scribbling on this envelope correctly, the interval
between when a wave-skimming cruise missile comes over the horizon (as
seen from 40 feet above the waterline) to impact is less than 4 seconds. 
Given the details of how a Phalanx operates, it better start firing within
a second after detection to have a good chance of hitting the missile. 
There\'s no way a human can have a say in that kind of decision. 

Even when a human is in the loop, the trend in modern weaponry is clearly
toward machines identifying, sorting, and prioritizing targets, a human
picking one from the list, and then the machines engaging the chosen
target.  This is happening most slowly in ground combat, which is the most
cluttered, confusing, hard-to-analyze kind.  It\'s progressing much more
rapidly in naval and air warfare.  Incidents like the Stark (Phalanx
turned off, ship trashed by Exocet) and the Vincennes (Aegis fire-control
system on, designates Iranian airbus as hostile, humans rubber-stamp this
decision, hundred of civilians die) are cautionary markers on a trail 
which we\'re nonetheless following.  And as technology improves, ground 
combat *will* follow suit, though probably always lagging sea, air, and 
space combat.

		 PROGRAMMING WITH 
                   PRIMORDIAL OOZE

                               Useful software begins 
                           to crawl out of digital gene pools

                   Computer programmers ascended the economic
                   food chain by inventing clever algorithms to make
                   manufacturing and service laborers redundant. But
                   some programmers may one day find themselves
                   automated out of a job. In university labs, scientists
                   are teaching computers how to write their own
                   programs. Borrowing from the principles of natural
                   selection, the researchers have built artificial
                   ecosystems that, for a few problems at least, can
                   evolve solutions better than any yet devised by
                   humans..."

	The article goes on to explain, in simple terms, what is going on in 
these systems.  But it was the end of the article that sent chills up 
my spine:

"                  Ultimately, evolved software may lead to evolved
                   hardware, thanks to the recent invention of circuit
                   boards that can reconstruct their circuit designs
                   under software control. Adrian Thompson of the
                   University of Sussex turned a genetic programming
                   system loose on one such board to see whether it
                   could produce a circuit to decode a binary signal sent
                   over an analog telephone line. Using just 100
                   switches on the board, the system came up with a
                   near-perfect solution after 3,500 generations.
                   Although the task is simple, "it would be difficult for a
                   designer to solve this problem in such a small area
                   and with no external components," Thompson says. 

                   "Hardware evolution demands a radical rethink of
                   what electronic circuits can be," he argues, because
                   evolution exploits the idiosyncratic behavior that
                   electrical engineers try to avoid. Although genetic
                   programs are largely still fermenting in their
                   primordial ooze, it seems just a matter of time until
                   they crawl out to find their niche. "

I know of where I can get both of these for you. (Second Hand book store).
If noone else has a deal for you, send me email and I\'ll see what the
prices are for you.

Will Hostman might be able to help you. He has some dupes, I think.

I recall (or think I do -- WISH I could remember the source) a contemporary
comment about King Stephen of England: "He was a kind man and did little

As for our modern political leaders, remember that, for any political
figure, the first step in being accurately assessed by history is to die.
Lots of now-esteemed public figures were thoughly despised in their lifetimes.

Nope - the Patrol Cruiser (and the other ships) were designed using the QSDS.  
However, the ships were designed at a time when the rules were still be 
written/revised.  Also, I admit there was a small cheat; Wildstar and Co 
cranked out a nifty "megalist" of all possible hull configurations for all 
sizes between 100 and 5000 tons.  The hulls in the designs came from that list, 
and in many cases there is not a 1:1 match with the much smaller hull list in 
QSDS.  The 200 vs 400 thing is just a mistake; it was definitely 400 tons.

Basically, it is left up to the designer.  Most of the "military" ships I 
designed used Largerstaterooms for passengers and officers, and Small 
staterooms for enlisted crew.  If you are really cramped for space, go ahead 
and bunk 2 per room (but expect a grumpy crew).

My T4 arrived this week (thanks Kevin) and my biggest complaint is the colour
ships.  I hated the style on the covers of SF books, and I still don\'t like
it.  I don\'t mind new ship designs, but I\'d like ones that seem to obey the

That\'s putting it rather mildly. TSR alleged that it was a copyright

This never turned up in _any_ of the documents that were produced

TSR settled out of court. They paid GDW for the printed inventory, and
Gary and others for the trademarks and copyrights. They got several
truckloads of product, and their check cashed very nicely.

        You\'re in big luck! I was wandering through a new game store (well,
old but new to me) a few weeks ago, saw an MT book and grabbed it up! Then I
got home and realized I already had it. So it\'s available.

        Also got a near-mint boxed set of black books (including Book4!),
which ain\'t available.

Loren,

_Truckloads_ of product?  Yow!

This brings up a question I\'ve wondered ever since I discovered how 
difficult some CT items were to find, and how easy it was to find other 
things:  What was the typical _first_ print run of a new product?  That 
is, not something like Alien Module #3, where you had a good idea of how 
many would sell.  Something like Twilight:2000, Dangerous Journeys, 
Traveller: 2300, or other new, untried products.

I\'m unlurking after a long time TRYING to keep up and failing...

I don\'t know if I\'ve posted this before so...

I got an idea from some of the comments that have been going around and
would like to share them... Jim don\'t think that I\'ll use these
neccessarily... :-) ( I KNOW you\'re reading this )...

Immortals:

Well yes we have been here for Milinnia...

We have been living amonst you, keeping a "Masquerade".

Have your players accidently find out one immortal\'s True status...
What will he/she do?
Kinda depends on what kind of project he/she has going, and how
convenient it is for him/her to "die" and go underground again.
He/She could just try to discredit them or Kill them, remember such
a being would be able to weild Tremendious power, both political and
physical.
Hummm this could make a campaign in its own right, but I see it as more
a side treck and problems to dodge, you might not let them realize why
they keep having problems, They are close to the "secret" and are being
warned off, but knowing players they would just go deeper into the
puzzle... ;-)

This could keep them happy for years... <eg>...

No Jim I Am NOT thinking of using this in our game! ( I wouldn\'t do
that... Would I?
Heh heh <eg>
Then again you might have already crossed paths with such and never
known it...
Who knows... I don\'t... Yet.

Just an Idea, Ya know it\'s hard to pass ideas on when one of your
players/Dm\'s also reads the list... :-)


I\'ve gotten T4!!! went to Gamescape, San Francisco. got the last one they had
at the time, ( I hope that they got more ).
I must say that I am impressed with the quality of the book, I have found a 
few typo\'s, most, I am sure have been mentined, but Jim hadn\'t noticed one 
Take a look at the Patrol Cruiser, if you realize that it is a 400 ton design,
things start to make sense, however the structure type is also incorrect as a
type 14 is a Sphere U 800 tons...

I was trying to design a ship... and was trying to work around the missing chart
Oh well, I guess I\'ll just have to get a web connection now... ;-)

All in all this is a much better than I expected, especially given the time
to sale of the finished product!
This is to say YEAH, I am right pleased, and I can only say keep up the good work
guys!
A very good and slick effort indeed!
 
I have just created a couple of charcters, I notice that everything is laid
out so it is easy to find. I do have a couple of further comments tho...

I noticed in the text under Mustering out Benifits, it says that there are 
only two types of ship aviable for mustering out - the Scout and the free trader
then in the chart for Noble is the Yacht, and under Scholer is the venreable
Lab ship...
I know that these inconsistancies will creep in and since my group is happy in the 
the Domain, in 1124? Yeah I think that is it - Jim?
We will probably keep these optins.
Here is another, under Psionics there is no Special...
But I can see reasons for its being left out, as a special should be so rare
that the GM should have control over it, and the charcter might not even know 
that he/she has it...
Oh HAPPY game hooks!

I do not wish to seem to be bashing what I feel is the best Trav. thing to come
allong in a very long time I am giving some fo the inconsistancies that have 
caught my eye so that they can be straightned out or expanded upon in the 
future that looks bright for this Traveller.

Thanks all!


See you

I am puzzled also. Surely when one says copies of T4 are almost sold one 
means the limited edition hardbound copies. Imperium Games would not be 
doing good business if they have almost depleted a first run at this 
stage, when neither (apparently) the UK nor Australasia have even seen 
the product.

But consider that the people producing those raw materials, and the
people supporting them, are a rather small fraction of the poipulation
of those countries.

If aliens were to abduct all the people in the third world, we\'d have
production restored rather quickly (and likely with *fewer* people).
All it\'d take would be enough people to run the equipment, and provide
support services for them. And I daresay that the equipment would
*quickly* get upgraded to reduce the number of people needed.

That\'s what it\'s going to be like on a typical colony world. They\'ll
have folks mining the minerals, and R&R facilities (aka "mining town")
nearby. They\'ll be linked to the rest of the planet by some sort of
transport net, be it sub-orbital shuttles, or seagoing ships.

Most of the people will be in the agricultural and industrial areas.
And the population required for a given tech level will be a lot lower
than you seem to think.

Actually, my interpretation can be found by looking at a cat (or dog).
The dewclaw would be roughly below the wrist (\'geneered out of vargr btw).
Aslan do _also_ have a apposable thumbs, leaving three fingers.  Hence the
reference to them as "toons."

I remember vividly in the late \'80\'s that all programming would be 
replaced by 4gl\'s by the middle of the next decade, and being told
the same thing in an interview.  A similiar article appeard in 
Newsweek, only about Smalltalk (the author should\'ve been shot for
some of the allegations made, but that\'s another issue).

Well, funny thing is, it _is_ the middle of the next decade, and while
_I_ am not doing mostly assembler any more, I\'m not working with anything
resembling a 4gl.  In fact I know of a few 4gl \'shops\' trying to retool 
away from them (and not Smalltalk :)

Anyway, I do agree that we\'re moving away from traditional programming 
methodologies (OOP being a real example), but don\'t forget that _someone_ 
has to program this special environment which does the programming (nice
viscious circle, huh?) for new hardware.  I don\'t doubt something like 
this can happen, but it\'s probably a _long_ way off (maybe the 57th 
century).

While most of them aren\'t much use for Traveller (you could use the armed

give you an idea of how my Traveller deckplans will eventually look.  (Ie. in
colour, for use with 25mm figures, and with small crosses marking the centre
of a square rather than having the squares ruled on the deckplan.)

I\'ve been thinking about how to accomodate the combat system (based on 1.5m
squares) with my existing 25mm designs.  The most obvious solution seems to
be to use a 3/4" grid instead of a 1" grid, while keeping the ship/building
scale the same.  Because these grids are on a separate layer in my original
drawings, I can easily enough produce TNE (2m squares) and T4 (1.5m squares)
versions of the same deckplan.  I could also produce a version without grid
markings.

I suppose you\'d need to talk to them, but here\'s my take on it.

2 weeks ago, Matt Machtan sent a note to the list saying that they 
anticipated having sold out the 1st printing by the end of the month 
(meaning September).  He said that they expected the 1st run to last 
until the end of the year.  At the time, they hadn\'t even received 
the hardbounds, so I\'m pretty certain he was talking paperbacks...  

Hope this helps...

Not quickly, slowly.  First you\'d have a lot of people in this 
country who wound up being economically dislocated (Newspeak for 
unemployed) because Acme Co. was no longer getting its regular 
shipments of Part X, whose main component was hypothetesium, which is 
mined mainly in Lower Slobovia...causing the ENTIRE assembly line to 
shut down.

Then you\'ve got to teach these laid off auto workers, defense 
workers, etc to become hypothetesium miners (this is not going to 
happen overnight).  Of course this is simplifying things.  First of 
all, you\'ve got to convince them that becoming a hypothetesium miner 
is even necessary, then you\'ve got to convince them to move to 
Slobovia, which incidentally, now has no government services, no 
working infrastructure, and no support services.  

Incidentally, there would be ripple effects from the loss of all these precious 
minerals (including the most precious  of all, OIL, I might add) which would 
cause just about anybody with a manufacturing job, or anybody whose business 
serves companies who manufacture, to have to make wholesale layoffs (read that, 
just about everybody).  

And if you think the pizza guy from down the street is going to make 
an adequate miner without training you\'re joking...chances are you\'re 
going to have to do a tough sell just to convince him even to do it.  

Think about the previous examples that happened, the Arab oil 
embargoes.  In 1973, the Arabs stopped oil exports for 3 or 4 months, 
and it creates instant chaos.  Long lines and rationing at the gas 
pumps, wholesale layoffs.  The US was in a recession for 2 years as a 
result of that 3 month problem...they even invented a new term for 
it, stagflation... 

Now think about what happens if all of a sudden ARAMCO walked off the 
job, FOREVER...

Not quickly at all.  All of a sudden tool manufacturing firms are 
going to be asked to produce several times as much of Product Y than 
they\'re used to producing:  Result: Inflation and backlogged 
orders... So they hire more workers and are now competing for what 
would now be an extremely scarce labor supply.  More inflation.  Yes, 
this problem would be corrected in the log run.  But for the short term, 
again, economic dislocation.

Doubtful.  This is an oversimplification.  First of all, consider the type 
of people who are going to colonize a typical world:  Ambitious, greedy nobles 
who see an opportunity to squeeze miners into a little kish, and impressed 
labor, because the average factory worker, or teacher, or grav cargo carrier 
from 2 parsecs over isn\'t going to give up his comfortable, safe job for a 
nasty, brutish short life in a mine on the latest frontier world...

Things are going to be as low tech as possible for a while, possibly 
decades or centuries, simply because support services are going to be 
mainly focused on providing the basics for the mines and the miners.  
Orbital cities, shuttles, etc, aren\'t going to happen until the 
colony is much more mature than it would be at the beginning.

> Most of the people will be in the agricultural and industrial areas.

Quite the opposite.  Most of them are going to be in support 
services.  That means running the company store, manning the starport 
facilities, running the bars, restaurants, brothels, etc. that would 
undoubtedly appear in mining towns.  Most vital materials to the 
colony are initially going to be imported, not manufactured locally.  
This would come later.  Since the actual tech level to which such a 
new colony could manufacture would be a lot lower than its needs, 
you\'re going to see a lot of importing...

In short, your model ignores economics, a foundation of the Traveller 
universe...

    'body' => 'After having watched the discussions of Year 0 and the role and nature =
of the nobility in Traveller I took some time to study feudalism as it =
has existed in our own history.  Here follows a few opinions on the =
discussion.

I believe that a monolithic nobility all serving at the pleasure of the =
Emperor is not as strong a realm for adventure and conflict as Traveller =
deserves, especially in Year 0.
The history of feudalism and nobility is filled with divided loyalties, =
subinfeudation and the richness of history that extends from such a =
situation.

1.  An example of subinfeudation and divided loyalties from a current =
campaign set in the post-virus era follows:

Lord Bertrand Charles Worchester is a Baron of the Imperial Court at =
Mora serving without a fief at the bloody edge of the newly reformed =
Imperium in Vland Sector. He is a Baron by the grace of the newly =
proclaimed Emperor (who most recently was simply Regent.) Before the =
Emperor made him a Baron he was a Knight Commander of the Order of =
Imperial Regency and therefore sworn to the Sovereign of the Order (who =
is not the Emperor.) He operates in Vland Sector which is the =
jurisdiction of a Duke sworn to the Archduke of Rylanor. The Duke was =
recently assassinated and if they Duchess, his wife, names him a Count =
and provides Lord Worchester with a fief then he will then be sworn to =
her also.

What do we have? A man sworn to the Sovereign of a Order, the Emperor, =
and soon perhaps, to a Duchess. A situation ripe for intrigue, conflict =
and adventure. Also a situation which mirrors the conflicting loyalties =
of our own western medieval history.

2.  A comment about what this would mean for the fighting forces of the =
Imperium.

Most Traveller materials take for granted a monolithic Imperial Navy and =
Marine.  One of the duties of a feudal lord was to raise and maintain =
troops to serve his liege in times of conflict. If we take the =
historical situation and extend it to the Traveller Universe we would =
then have the naval units and marine forces of the Duchy of Park called =
to service of the emperor. These forces would include the ships and men =
raised by Count Parquad and Baron Nivar all wearing distinctive insignia =
and flying the colors of their liege.

Just some thoughts.

But only sometimes.. the essence of 3cI is to put your men in a position
where they have a basic knowledge of what to expect, so that fire control
and discipline is maintained.  This is a basic as "don\'t shoot until you see
the whites of their eyes".  I\'m certain that a Trepida has an excellent fire
control system that includes sensor profiles for all known threat vehicles
and some sort of IFF system, however, the final shoot/no shoot is going to
be the gunner\'s job.

Something that just occured to me.. in the early days of the Rebellion, how
many battles came to a screeching halt when the fire control programs
announced that that was an Imperial tank/ship/whatever, and couldn\'t be
engaged... (Imagining the face of some Admiral as the computer tells him
that he\'s in violation of Navy reg KS3558.635-3(y))

Which is why we spend MCr on point defence fire control for our vehicles.
That is the "turn it loose" type of weapon you are talking about.  Speaking
from experience, an Apache helicopter can hide behind terrain, and give you
less than three seconds exposure and fire *six* AT missles at six different
targets.  In the face of this, the Army is already developing
counter-measures, such as prismatic smoke to defeat the targeting laser.
Having a small chaingun slaved to a low-power radar as a point defence
weapon would be a good idea.  that would be the kind of thing that became
part of the battle drill: "atomic batteries to power, turbines to speed,
point defence active and scanning."

Tell me about it.  There is progress being made however.  The Army is
testing an outgrowth of the GPS system that allows every vehicle in the unit
to know where his comrades are, and reiceve updated enemy information as
battalion processes contact reports.  This allows for junior commanders to
have a much better picture of what is happening around them.

Most tank combat happens at about 750-1000m, Infantry engages at 50m(!) This
tells you the nature of the two "contact" arms.  Tanks can have all the
bells and whistles they want; I want a good rifle and a deep hole.  Using
Combat/Battledress you could put a transponder/IFF system in, but you don\'t
want to give an infantryman to much to look at, or he won\'t see the bad guy
until to late.

Very true, although when all is said and done, it will still come down to a
bunch of dirty, tired guys with rifles (bolt-action, ACR, Gauss, or plasma..
makes no difference) crawling through the remains of a city.

Seriously, I\'m looking forward to seeing some of your deckplans.  I remember 
playing Snapshot and my campaign seems to be missing that kind of element.  I 
hope that you will start with all the CT ship designs and then branch out from 
there.  Question:  If I sent you a (paintbrush) sketch of a ship design, plus 
its QSDS stats, how difficult would it be for you to come up with a deckplan?  
Would you be willing to do this?

Well, IMHO, the ref should provide a few hidden (or not-so-hidden) advantages 
for the straight-laced PC.  Although we are talking about technique, and each 
ref\'s style is different, it might make for some interesting game play if one 
of the PCs can do some things because of his/her general morality or ethics.

For example, a psionic may approach the PCs and probe them (assuming they are 
not shielded, of course) to see of any are trustworthy.  A psionic will want 
to contact the most morally upright individual and probably aviod contact with 
the others.

Another example may be that the PCs reputation as a goody two-shoes has 
preceeded him/her and certain NPCs would react to the group like this, "If 
Alexander Hood says so, then it is so."   -or-   "I\'ll lend you my air/raft if 
Captain Hood drives it, I know that he can be trusted..."

Terminally honest people are few and far between, but they stick together as 
well.  The morally upright PC is more likely to have trustworthy NPCs as 
contacts, since there is a mutual trust between them.

Rough, but knowledgable guess.  A 1993 Freightliner (tables I have) tractor
weights around 10,000 lbs empty plus fuel (60 gal), water & oil add another
1000 to 1500 lbs.  A trailer is more iffy, for a 40\' van I\'d say about 6000
to 8000 lbs.  A sleeper would be another 1000 to 4000 lbs, varies greatly
with design and comfort.  All told empty weight would be in the neighborhood
of 20,000 lbs (9000 kg).  Max weight requirements vary per state and change
almost yearly.  IIRC it\'s 80,000 lbs (36,000 kg) in Texas, others are from
55,000 to 100,000.

Hope this helps.

"Evidence"  A patron encounter for one player.
Armond Jocoby, an attorney from a local law firm has approached the character 
with an offer that will pay handsomely if the character is successful.  A 
wealthy businessman will be on trial in a few weeks and a valuable piece of 
evidence is necessary to bring about a favorable outcome on behalf of his 
client.

Armond Jacoby - UPP 8769A8 - Age 40	
Liason-4, Vehicle-2, Recruiting-1, Computer-2, (other skills if necessary)

The attorney will produce a contract promising to pay the character and 
reimburse the character\'s travel expenses in the form of two mid passages upon 
successful delivery of the documents.  The attorney will provide a sealed 
letter of subpoena for notarized copies of the documents in question.

1-2	The attorney\'s client is the defendant, and the charges brought against 
him are false.  The evidence are signed and dated documents which prove the 
defendant was in another system on the date the defendant allegedly committed 
the crime.  The attorney will pay Cr.15,000 on delivery of the documents.  If 
the character attempts to sell the documents to the opposing attourneys, 
Jacoby\'s firm will file a law suit against the character.

4	As above, except the attorney\'s client is the plaintiff, and the documents 
prove that the defendant was at a particular location and is guilty of the 
accusations.  The plaintiff\'s law firm will offer Cr.15,000 for the documents. 
 The character may attempt to sell the evidence to the defendant\'s attorney, 
who will cautiously cooperate, for a higher sum.

5	The attourney represents the plaintiff, and the defendant is a member of the 
local organized crime syndicate and the character will be followed to the 
location of the documents.  After the character receives the documents, a thug 
hired by the defendants attorney\'s will attempt to kill the character and 
steal the documents.  The law firm will offer Cr25,000 for the documents, but 
can be persuaded to pay up to Cr40,000 if the character complains about the 
hazard.

Thug - AA9644 - Age 32
Brawling-2, Pistol-2, Blade-2, Streetwise-2

6	As 1 above, but the defendant is a leader of the local mafia and some time 
after successful delivery of the documents, the leader will summon the 
character to his lavish home to show his appreciation.  The leader will speak 
admirably of the character\'s ability to "retrieve" things and will offer a job 
running small packages and cash back and forth from this world and the origin 
of the documents.  If the character refuses, the leader will be gracious, but 
will not hassle the character again.  If the character accepts the offer, 
there will be more adventure ahead.

Leonard, I\'m afraid you\'ve stepped onto *my* field of expertise, so get
ready for the lecture. <g>

First, I know that rum is made from molasses and that molasses is made from
sugar.  Molasses is a byproduct of sugar production in the way that diesel
fuel is a byproduct of oil refining.  The reason much of the sugar cane was
partially refined, ie converted into molasses and brown sugar, was because
it travelled better, was more compact, and could be sold at higher prices. 
Not very much was fully refined in the Indies, that was too costly.  And
yes, rum was made in the Indies in some quantities, but that rum was
consumed locally or shipped to Europe.  It didn\'t really figure into the
Triangle Trade.

Now about the Triangle Trade...

"The first part of the journey was a voyage from colonial seaports to
Africa.  The colonial ships carried rum and finished goods which were
traded on the west coast of Africa for gold and slaves.  On the second part
of the journey, the ships sailed from Africa to the West Indies with a ship
load of slaves.  In the West Indies, the slaves were traded for molasses,
[brown] sugar or money.  The final leg of the triangle was the ships\'
journey from the West Indies back to New England.  In the colonies, the
molasses and sugar were sold to distillers and made into rum.  The ships
were ready to fill their holes with rum and repeat the three steps in the
triangular trade."
    -- _America it\'s People and Values_; Dr Leonard Wood, Dr Ralph
        Gabriel, Mr Edward Biller; 1975; p105.
        
There were many trading cycles, but the one known historically as the
"Triangle Trade" is the one described above.  This trade cycle remained
profitable for independent merchants for well over 100 years.  Normally, a
profitable long-term trading cycle is taken over by big companies, but that
never happened with the "Trade", and the reason why is the same reason it
was *so* notorious...it was illegal from stem to stern!

The West Indies ports the colonial ships stopped at were often French,
Dutch or Spanish.  These ports were off limits to them by both English and
the French/Dutch/Spanish law.  Nobody paid taxes or tariffs on the slaves
sold and the molasses and sugar bought.  The ships did not sail to England
for Doc Stamps, as law required, instead smuggled their cargos into
American ports, where Customs Officers were bribed, intimidated, or
otherwise avoided.

The ships leaving the New England ports sailed directly to, mainly
Portuguese, colonies on the west coast of Africa, not to England, so no Doc
Stamps, no taxes.  Trading with the Portuguese was illegal too, but that
didn\'t stop the Americans, they sold their loads of rum and goods for a
tidy profit.  They filled their holes with gold, silver, ivory, and slaves
with part of their profits,
pocketing the rest.  Then it was off to the West Indies again to sell the
slaves and buy sugar and molasses for the next cycle.

In the American colonies \'illegal\' activities were common.  Trade with the
indian nations was supposedly regulated, but unauthorized expeditions were
common.  Rum, whiskey, and trinkets for fur was profitable and they weren\'t
going to let laws get in the way.

Land development in the west was, first \'discouraged\', then
\'regulated\', then \'controlled\', and finally \'prohibited.\' Nobody paid any
attention, they kept moving west and taking the land.  When the colonists
got into trouble they called for help, and if it didn\'t come or they were
forced to leave their land they grumbled, and complained.  Eventually they
went back this time with their own militias to back them up.

It was illegal to manufacture hats, woolens, ironware and many other
products, but the Americans did it anyway.  First, in small quantities for
local consumption.  Then in larger quantities for trade among themselves. 
Eventually, in quantities too large for the English to miss..or ignore. 

The crack-downs on these \'crimes\' were sporadic and usually
ineffective.  Over time they made the Americans more and more
estranged from the "mother country", and as much as anything lead to the
Revolution.

Back to the Trade...

The merchants were taking a big chance on every voyage, on every leg of the
voyage.  They either made a quick killing...or they got killed.  So, they
armed their ships and didn\'t hesitate to "defend" themselves.  The
successful grew rich and either went \'legit\' with more (but usually not
entirely) legal routes, or used their funds to branch into other promising
modes of speculation....

"In times of war, some of them ventured into the profitable business of
privateering, and since the distinction between war and peace was not
always clear in these years, a few of them extended their activities into
piracy."
    -- _The History of the United States_; Dr Charles Warren; 1967;
        p119.

...and banking, land speculation, the fur trade, and manufacturing.

Now the Traveller hook...

If you want to run a Trading Game you can lay out a similar set of
circumstances in your game Universe.  You need several factions, pocket
empires frex, with a large intermixed area of stars on a main.  Throw in
some restrictive laws concerning trade with other factions.  Add loose
enforcement of the trade laws (dump those dang transponders).  And finish
it off with some trade items that you can buy cheaply here and sell dearly
there.  You\'ll have the conditions that created the "Spanish Main" and the
adventure of the 1650-1800 period.

Whoa!  When did that happen?  

I thought T4 was going to use 2m x 2m squares (like TNE), as opposed to
CT/MT\'s 1.5m x 1.5m squares..right?

The UK HAS seen the product, BITS were selling it at Euro GenCon, as were

Some game distributors (Armory and Wargames West) used to list the phone numbers of 
stores in alphabetic order by state, but these ads offer no warranty as to how good, 
from a gamer point-of-view, the stores really are. Most listed stores are comics shops, 
which usually stock only the best-selling games (WW, T$R, WotC, etc...).

Will your adventure "The Long Way Home" eventually make its way over here? I want a 
copy, Andy!

My players play fast and loose with the firearms laws of the various worlds they visit 
- -- but then again, so do the NPCs -- but other than assault/manslaughter, my players 
stay away from crime.

In my TNE game, most of the PCs are troopers of some kind -- Marines are favored. 
The Army, Navy and Scouts are represented, but most of the characters are lean, green 
killin\' machines.

In my T4 game, _nobles_ dominate the game. This may change as IG comes out with the 
Really Big Guns Book (CSC).

As for the characters I play -- my favorite is an (TNE) ex-Marine Special Ops LtCol with 
a professorial bent (his college degree is in History, specializing in Ancient Solomani 
Military History, which lets him quote everyone from Homer and Sun-Tsu to Guderian and 
Colin Powell). I wanted to play someone who was _not_ a square-jawed WASP, so I made him 
 Sino-Solomani. As a Marine, he could be expected to be an expert in hand-to-hand 
combat, so his other passion became, yes, Unarmed Martial Arts. Thus was born Wu Li, 
callsign Kung Fu, of the Aubani Marines.

As far as criminality is concerned, Li believes in the RC\'s ideals, but he does the 
thinking and moralizing before and after the mission. He once brought up a fellow PC up 
on charges after a S&G when it was discovered that the other PC killed two civilians in 
a DZ who were fleeing and not a threat. The PC beat the charges (the courts-martial was 
a dramatic highlight of the entire campaign), and Li was pulled from the team ("RAM 
grenades are simply _too_ effective against light BD, and it\'s too easy to miss with one 
. . . accidents happen, Colonel Li."). The other PC learned from this, and he eventually 
became the conscience of the team.

What, no Yuppies? ;) The NPCs in my T4 game are fellow nobles, retainers, and criminals. 
One of the retainers is a Rogue trying to go straight. Unfortunately, she is what one 
can call a Trouble Magnet. No matter how hard she tries to stay out of hack, trouble 
inevitably finds her. She _never_, and I mean NEVER starts the Trouble, but she has such 
a degree of Unluck that her roguish skills never want for practice.

The American combat vehicles in _Executive Orders_ carry just such as system: the 
Individual Vehicle Information System (IVIS). This system is used to great effect at the 
NTC and on the battlefield in the novel. The original intent of IVIS was to prevent  
friendly-fire incidents like those that killed so many troopers in the Gulf War. The 
next step might be to add datalink point-defense (aka AEGIS) capability to IVIS with 
turret MGs slaved to the system as opposition missiles get smarter.

Egad, this is a tired and cobweb covered argument...and I\'m not sure 
how accurate it is at the moment.  Go onto any of the rec.games.* 
newsgroups, and you can see this same tired argument from the point 
of view of that particular newsgroup.

No, you\'re not going to see T4 stocked at your local Sears (as you used to 
with D&D stuff).  Really, the difference between then and now is 
there are more choices.  When I bought my first Traveller books, the 
RPG genre was limited to:  Tunnels and Trolls, En Garde, AD&D, D&D, 
Gamma World, and that was about it.  A few things came out a year or 2 
later, but for a long time, Traveller succeeded because it was first 
(and best) on the shelves in its genre.  I can\'t tell you how many people 
bought the 1st black boxed set, and never bought anything else for the game.  
I have a neighbor who has 2 of them, who has never bought anything else for 
the game, or even played it.  I doubt even AD&D doesn\'t have the market share 
it had then.  

T4 is not going to sell this way.  To make the new edition succeed, we 
need to run it at tournaments, run it in stores that offer space for the 
purpose, and be visible at the game stores.  The store that I bought my 
softcover from wound up selling another couple of copies the same day 
because I talked to the person running the shop about it, and I knew 
a little bit about what the new system was like...and other customers 
started asking ME questions about it.  FWIW, we know A LOT more 
about T4 than most of the folks selling it...

As for the generic, XXX is dying comment...  (Fill in XXX with 
wargames, RPG\'s, miniatures, CCG\'s, the fringe hobby of your choice)  
I offer the following rebuttal:

In my community, there are more game stores now than there have been 
at any time since I started gaming (as a board gamer, I must admit) 
back in \'76.  Two of the ones here are doing such a brisk business that 
they\'ve opened second locations in the last 12-18 months.  The hobby 
is basically in specialty retailers, and not all that present in the hobbyshops 
and certainly not in the mass retailers of a few years ago, but IMHO 
this was all but inevitable.  CCG\'s have taken a little away from the RPG 
market, but eventually, CCG people are going to realize that strip it down 
to the basics, and they\'re playing a card game, nothing more and nothing less.  

Nothing in the world quite equals the dynamic storytelling nature of a good RPG, 
where referee and PC\'s together weave a story.  For this reason, RPG\'s as a 
hobby will never die.  But IMNSHO, just throwing a good product on 
the shelves, without supporting it, isn\'t going to work like it has 
in the past.  I\'ve converted 3 new players to Traveller in the last several 
months.  I\'ve got a couple of other people I plan to work in during 
the next few months...  Far from dying, I am beginning to think they 
may be about to undergo a renaissance...

1)  What "style" or "flavor" of Traveller play do you participate in?

a) FREE-WHEELING: A campaign where PCs wander about in search of adventure, 
often setting their own goals and objectives in spite of various rumors and 
encounters by the referee.

b) STORY-TELLING:  A campaign where PCs participate in a story, pretty-much 
narrated/controlled by the referee.

c) ONE SHOT ADVENTURES:  A series of individual adventures, where PCs may or 
may not be the same every time, but otherwise unrelated to one another as they 
would be in a campaign.

d) OTHER:  Another style that doesn\'t fit in the above.

I wish!  :)  As a GM I really wish my players were like this, and I have
tried to gently push them in that direction, but...well, PCs will be PCs.

This is basically the game style I play.  Without a sense of direction in an
adventure, my PCs won\'t do much really.  I have to give them not-so subtle
clues, or some sort of reward to \'gently\' get them going.  I wish it were
different, but I hope they\'re changing.

Thanks,

You\'ll have to wait for two reasons:

1) My only active game right now is Space: 1889, and I need to finish an
ether flyer for the next adventure.

2) My night school job starts this week, and my continuing ed course next
month (this in addition to a 50-60 hour day job).  This leaves very little
time for laundry, let alone gaming.  Now, if someone were to offer to mark 35
2000-word essays I could be persuaded to draw some deck plans :-)


Of course, if you remove the solar boiler the Space: 1889 vessels don\'t look

one thing.  How does one pursue a career (4 year stint, as noted in para 3,

As I understand it, one does so by finding a pop 9+ planet with a branch of
the institute and then applying to be examined.  After examination, if one
is able to unlock one\'s potential (all in col 1, p123), one can pursue a
Psionicist career.  

Is the implication that the referee pulls the character out of an ongoing
career for 4 years to do so?  This would seem to be v. disruptive of all but
the longest campaigns...

Alternately, is the implication that characters who are pursuing careers
(pregame) can or should check to find branchs of the Psionics Institute, and
on finding same, may be examined and admitted?

I\'ve worked this solution:  Between each 4 year term of pregame career, one
can check to see whether one served on a Pop 9+ world (1/12 chance) and if
so, make an attempt to find a branch of the Psionics Inst. as noted in col
1, p123.  If one locates a branch, one may test (if one has the money or
makes the requisite charity roll) and, if one wants to enter the institute,
one may change careers to attend school (again, assuming adequate funds or
charity).  Requiring the character to make a continuance roll in the prior
career gives a chance that, say, in the military, the character was not
released.  If the character elects to go to Psi school anyway, they incur
later adventure seeds as the police, military, disgruntled former
associates, etc., try to track them down and bring them to justice (or
whatever passes for...)  I suppose, if a characters from a Pop 9+ world, one
could check for a branch of the institute before pursuing ANY careers -
Making a Staggering INT roll without any modifiers would, of course, be
problematic, but not impossible...

The preceding works, tho it\'s inelegant.  I\'m curious, however, as to what
the designers\' intent was...  Comments?

I agree. What was always needed, and to some extent it was at the referees discretion, was an opportunity to 
adventure in an environment like the early years of the Dutch and English East India Companies at the 
forefront of an expending empire, operating in regions where "life was wild and, on the whole, tax free". An 
environment where one trading company could trade a Nutmeg rich island with another trading company for an 
island that would later become the largest city in the world. An environment where trading companies had 
imperial charters to establish trading links that would both return wealth to the home world but would also 
further the reaches of the empire. An environment where the nobility largely stayed home with their parlour 
games while the merchant/trader class with their attached Imperial troops and mercanaries took on their rivals 
in an enormous land and resource grab. That was the type of environment in which I always ran my CT campaign 
despite the growing wealth of background material which tended to describe an environment more like the later 
years of the great adventuring trading Companies, where power was shifting from the hands of the 
merchant/traders into those of the colonial civil service(the Raj).

Same here.  I have only two players (unfortunately) and one is a very
go-getter, his characters seek out adventure, and he seems to understand the
idea behind roleplaying games.  The second player is a complete opposite.
Unless I\'m dealing directly with him (hard since he does nothing) he\'s
rolling dice, looking at things in the gaming area, or eating\\drinking.

Again, same here.  I suggested, in a long running AD&D campaign (characters
at 9th level) that we begin anew and I was almost lynched.  Needless to say,
we continued (the campaign ended on a messy note quite soon after with the
characters being ripped apart by gargoyles - this was a coincendence!)

Well shoot, it does say that!  I *know* this is a change from what we heard
here this summer.

So, are we back to displacement tons being a pair of 1.5 squares? (1.5^2 x
1.5^2 x 3.1m) is approximately 14^m.

There aren\'t a lot of "critical" materials that are being produced
using shaft mining. Open pit mines are a lot easier to teach people to
work. And *much* easier to automate.

Two comments:
1. Draft them (admittedly a last resort)
2. check the unemployment rate for members of the United Mine Workers.
   There are a lot of *trained* people available who aren\'t working.

Simple, the unemployed oil workers (most of whom roamed from field to
field as the work shifted) in places like Texas, Oklahoma, and even
Alaska could be recruited in a matter of days, and then shipped over to
the Gulf area, along with some national guard units to run the
kitchens, laundries etc until we could recruit civilians to fill the
jobs.

During the embargo, much of the trouble was caused by the way things
were done here, *long* before the supplies got scarce. And in any case,

Why? Where do you think the equipment comes from *now*? The upgrades
would be subject to limits on how fast we can produce things, but in
most cases these upgrades would consist of things like conveyer belts
and bulldozers (standard sand & gravel pit gear) replacing shovels and
human bucket chains. The specialized stuff takes longer, but is done on
a "special order" basis anyway.

Since we *only* need to run the mines, ports, and some support
structures, that labor shortage isn\'t likely to be as bad as you think.
Also, much of the labor needed will be *exactly* the type where folks
in the US have become "technologically unemployed".

Better study history. The Belgian Congo was handled the way you
describe, but not much else.

As for teachers, factory workers, etc, consider everything from the
1849 Gold Rush, to the Alaska Oil Boom. The guy at the local McDonalds
is quite likely to be *very* willing to go to this frontier planet a
couple parsecs away because he can do the exact same kind of work and
get paid ten times what he\'s earning now. Sure, the accomodations are
kinda crude, and there\'s not much to do on your days off. But with
labor being scarce, rates are high and folks get treated halfway
decently. They\'ll have to work *hard*, but they\'ll get paid for it.

Try again. You\'ll have low tech were low tech both does the job, and
doesn\'t use too many people. You\'ll have high tech where it is *needed*
and where it lets you use fewer people. Support costs for *people* are
one of your major expenses. So given a choice between a "low tech"
method that uses 20 people, and a high tech one that costs 10 times as
much, but only uses 2 people, the high tech approach is what\'s likely
to happen, unless spare parts are a problem (they usually aren\'t, it\'s
repairmen that are a problem!).

> Orbital cities, shuttles, etc, aren\'t going to happen until the 
> colony is much more mature than it would be at the beginning.

Orbital cities, yes and no. An orbital station and a small satellitie
network are *always* a good investment. It\'s a lot easier to have ships
unload stuff in orbit than on the ground. On the ground it usually
needs more protection! In orbit, all it needs is a tether and a "sun
screen". You shuttle it down when needed.

Satellites give you weather info (*damned* important), as well as cheap
communications and a way to keep an eye out for smugglers (if that\'s a
problem). They also provide a search and rescue network. Even if you
don\'t care about the people the *equipment* is worth money.

You *need* shuttles, both to handle the ground to space traffic (orbit
to orbit haulers are a *lot* cheaper!) and for some of the point to
point traffic *on* the planet. The colony *will* spread out, as the
best areas for living and producing food are unlikely to be near the
major mineral deposits. So you need to be able to move people and light
cargo *quickly* (emergency equipment breakdowns, medical emergencies,
etc) which requires craft that might as well be shuttles. You also need
slower "buses" and "trucks" for hauling large amounts of people or cargo.

Given the various possibilities, I\'m pretty sure that a
"semi-ballistic" shuttle is probably one of the better options
available under the vehicle rules, if you want something capable of
making "intercontinental" trips quickly but cheaply. And any such
vehicle is so close to being ground to orbit capable, that at even year
0 tech levels, you might as well do so. 

The options for "slow cargo" require more thought.

By "areas" I meant *regions*. To restate it: most of the people are
going to be *located* in the regions where most of the food is produced
and where industrial production takes place. 

Most of these people will be working "support" jobs. But their
*physical location* will be near where the production jobs are, whether
it be food production, raw material extraction, or some sort of light
industry.

Don\'t confuse "industry" and "heavy industry".

It\'s unlikely that they will be producing spaceships or grav vehicles.
Or even stoves. But they *will* be producing housing materials locally
quite early. And the same goes for food. They\'ll import a lot of stuff
people are "used to", but local foods will be exploited, simply because
it\'s *cheaper*. Hunting/fishing at first, as well as gathering any
"wild" vegetation that is edible. 

Stuff like concrete and lumber will get produced locally from very
early on, and more advanced building materials will follow. The
decision here is between paying shipping (and living with the snafus
involved) and importing some "simple" equipment to produce the
materials locally.

Lumber and cement win this one hands down. A sawmill is easy to
transport, easy to set up, and much of it can be operated at any of a
variety of tech levels. Blades need to be imported (at least at first),
but even so, they last a fair while (and when they wear out, the high
quality steel scrap is worth good money!)

Concrete basicly requires a few rather common kinds of rock (common on
any planet that humans would *want* to live on) some rock crushing
gear, and the like. You need the rock crusher for gravel, and for
mining, so it\'s pretty much a given. You also need an "oven" to roast
the cement in. Again, pretty simple, and if you are starting low tech,
you can build it *very* low tech.

Plastics and structural steel are a somewhat different matter. You\'ll
need more gear hauled in to start up, but not as much as you might
think. 

There are a *lot* of "high tech" items that can be produced using
mostly *low* tech, with only a few "high tech" items. For example, you
can produce modern steel alloys with a steel plant out of the 1800s,
just by adding some modern instruments to monitor some steps of the
process. 

> In short, your model ignores economics, a foundation of the Traveller 
> universe...

No. I\'m aware of economics. Including the fact that in a colony type
situation, *people* are going to be the expensive resource. "Slave
labor" doesn\'t cut it, especially if you need then to do anything
"technical". 

If you are going to use the "transportee" colony model (like parts of
Australia), then you either commit to shipping in *lots* of food, or
you make self-sufficincy for staple food products your number one
priority. And that *includes* being able to maintain whatever "tech" is
involved without large, steady imports of parts/fuel/whatever.

> However, your model would probably be workable for an established 
> mining colony, it just isn\'t going to start out that way...

A colony that isn\'t "established" is an unstable situation. And any
*imtelligent* planner is going to try to minimize the instabilities by
trying to find local alternatives to imports.

I still maintain that if the infrastructure is present, then your TL <=
PL rule is wrong. Once the population hits the millions, the potential
is there to support *any* tech level.And there will be a tech level
(higher than ours :-) at which the number of people required to
*maintain* the tech level starts going *down*. 

Mind you, if you knock out huge chunks of the technological
infrastructure, then the situation is quite different, because you may
be in the situation of having to rebuild something from the ground up.

Already happened, except in reverse. Falklands war. One of the several
reasons that the HMS Sheffield got plastered (and that it was so easy
to plaster the Admiral Belgrano) was that the *defensive* systems

Needless to say more modern gear is supposed to be designed with the
assumption that you might just be fighting your "allies" some day.

Actually, this involves a *major* problem with the traveller TL system.
It doesn\'t distiunguish between knowledge and infrastructure. 

For example, if I could speak the language and had local money, I could
build any number of "high tech" items in cultures as low tech as
Assyria or Egypt.

In fact, nothing from before the 1850s is too "high tech" to build
essentially from scratch. That\'s when we start getting precision
machining, which can be a pre-requisite for many items. And as far as
"hardware" type technology goes, you get up to WWII before you run into
stuff that\'d be a bitch to build even as a "one off". 

Harry Harrison\'s story "The Ethical Engineer" (published in book form
as "Deathworld 2" goes into a lot of this.

But as an example, if I got stranded on this Egyptian/Roman level
planet during a survey mission, I could build a *radio* to signal for
help and do so from native materials. I could also produce some nasty
chemical weapons to convince the local warlord that I was someone he
wanted to keep... :-)

So we actually need to seperate "knowledge" (theory) and "tooling".

As I said, the tooling required for *anything* before the mid 19th
century was stuff that a knowledgeable person could build from scratch
with some help. Much later than that and you start to get into the
"tools to build the tools to build..." problem.

As an example, building a lathe or milling machine is *easy* IF you
already have one! If you only have one left after the war, then you\'d
better treat it *very* gently and make the creation of parts to build a
second one your primary concern!

So there are two ways to lose tech levels. Lose the equipment operators
(and the books!) or lose enough equipment that you not only can\'t
replace it easily, but you may not be able to build the "layers" of
pre-requisite tools in time to stave off problems.

History of tech has been an interest of mine for a long time. And so
has the "problem" of how to get from "nothing" to a given item.

What with folks trying to colonize, I rather expect that by Year 0 (if
not sooner!) there will exist "books" (more likely *rugged* AI based
portable libraries) that will essentially let you tell them what tools
you have, and what item/tool you need, and they\'ll offer you the choice
of the "fastest" way to get there, or of taking a but longer but
producing more generalized tools along the way, so that next time you
need something you\'ll have a broader "industrial base".

These may well be the basis of the "Imperial standard technology
packets" that folks have talked about from time to time.

My style is like this, except for the "in spite of various rumors and 
encounters by the referee" part.  The initial adventure is usually 
something pre-planned to some extent - I decide the what the hook will 
be, and map out a few highlights of the plot before-hand.  Once the 
characters muster out and "find" eachother somehow, something will happen 
that sets them on the course to that first adventure.  

Thereafter, I try to provide what the players want.  I determine this by 
listening to what they say, paying attention to what their characters say 
and do, etc.  Usually, that first adventure provides hooks all by itself 
(in a sense) that allow the players to go in the direction they want to go.

It\'s difficult to explain, really.  I guess you could say it is a 
cooperative free-wheeling style.

Role-playing /is/ a skill, and it takes time to develop it, like any 
skill.  I didn\'t fully understand that until I moved here to IL and tried 
to get my wife involved in RPGs.  She was interested in doing so, but 
unsure of her ability.  I figured it would be no problem.  I knew I could 
get her interested in a story line, and if I could do that, the rest 
would flow easily.

After teaching her a bit about the game, she rolled up a character and we 
started our first session.  I used my usual free-wheeling style...and it 
was a disaster.

Free-wheeling role-play requires that the players act as mini-GMs in a 
sense.  They have to make a /lot/ of decisions, and give the referee 
hints as much as the referee gives them hints.  

New players, I\'ve discovered, aren\'t ready for that.  The pre-planned 
adventures are like training wheels.  And they need those training 
wheels.  You can wean them off as they gain skill, but it takes time, 
experience, and a lot of coaching.

The first few adventures were very frustrating for both Carole and I, 
because I was expecting her to play like my old players back in CA, who 
had years and years of experience.  Once I realized what I was doing 
wrong, thouhg, things got better.

Eventually, Carole and I played several pre-planned adventures in CT, and 
the last we did was pretty darned fun for both of us.  It\'s been about a 
year since we\'ve played (we\'ve been busy with other things), but we\'re 
both excited about playing T4 once a few more supplements come out.  She 
still needs for me to pre-plan things, but she is coming along and has 
her own thoughts on where the adventure should go from time to time.  

Perhaps by the time the next Gen-Con comes around she will be confident 
enough to play in a couple games there.  Until then, we\'ll keep the 
training wheels on to one degree or another.

Oh, and one more caveat: I realize that not everyone wants to spend the 
time to become that skilled of a role-player.  There are definite levels 
of role-play, and different people are comfortable with different 
levels.  

Yet, in the back of my mind, the notion remains that if everyone could 
experience the thrill of the highest level of role-play, they wouldn\'t be 
satisfied with the lesser levels.

yesterday\'s session.  Please note that it was only the _third_ game of 
the campaign, no less!

Background:  Players have been hired on as crew of a 200mt Frontier 
Trader (an older vessel recently upgraded to Jump-3, TL 12 with cramped 
accommodations being run by a non-spacer bank executive concerned with 
getting it from Strouden/Lunion to Regina as quickly as possible for 
delivery to new owner while cutting costs to the bone, largely in the 
form of minimal salaries).

Every single one of the characters save one promptly decide that the 
best way to come out of this ahead is to steal the vessel and head for 
the Darrian Confederation, and hence to a life of piracy and mayhem.  
All save one.  This one, upstanding Imperial Navy retiree, an engineer 
with two decades\' experience, multiple decoration, and a personality 
best described as \'sensible\' is obviously not going to go along.

While plotting just how to convert him, two of the other characters 
(pilot and navigator, no less) convince him to overpower the 1G thrust 
plates by one hundred per cent in order to make a flashy (? at 2G who\'s 
going to be impressed, anyways?) burn into Lanth.  Upon doing so, this 
exceptionally competent fellow promptly botches in the worst possible 
way.  Not wishing to doom them or anything, but feeling obliged to make 
their lives miserable as a result of this engineering abuse, I ruled 
that a power converter that feeds the thrusters has burned out.  No 
thrust, 210 minutes from burning up in Lanth\'s atmosphere, and an 
inventive technician.  No problem.  I figured they\'s borrow/modify a 
part or two from the jump drive (it _must_ have power converters, no 
matter if they\'re of a different sort. . .).

I must say, I have never seen so many rolls failed quite so badly.  In 
the end, the ship burns up in the atmosphere with the engineer still 
trying to right things while everyone else evacuated, to be picked up 
by a passing patrol cruiser.

Our game\'s resident statistician calculated the odds of such a thing 
happening as being about 6/1000.

[sigh]

You just cannot keep players out of trouble. . .

The specific location details are *not* in the JTAS article! (the article
just says that Bwaps come from "the Lentuli subsector", and gives a vague
direction). This may mean that I took the Bwaps details from the original
HIWG disks I received from Clay Bush (3 years ago now!). These are probably
the same ones available at Peter Berghold\'s site.

Peter, can you confirm this? If the location data IS there, where did it
come from?

BTW, the link to Bwaps *IS* now available from my _Traveller Library Data_
page. You can get to it from my link page at:
        http://pcug.org.au/~davidjw

I have now put "A" and "B" library data on-site. Sorry: cross-references are
yet to be added to the pages, and I haven\'t yet converted the many index
pages (eg. Bestiary, Archdukes, The Emperor\'s List, etc), but it\'s a start!

Anywhere from 10K to 50K. Average new run was about 20K. The theory
was to sell enough in the initial glut to distributors th leave you
with no more than one year\'s inventory (keep stuff more than one year
=  pay taxes on it in two separate fiscal years = _bad_ thing).

On another topic:

The discussion of the Aslan dewclaw gives me the opportunity to
correct something that went astray years ago. Bill Keith and I
intended for the dewclaw to be on the _end_ of the thumb, not the
palm, and Bill\'s original drawings showed this. Unfortunately, one of
his drawings was less than clear on the subject, and it was _this_
drawing that was used by Steve Venters when he did the art for the
Aslan module (Murphy strikes again). DGP took their inspiration from
the Venters art, and the error was propogated.

It is a minor point, but I\'m trying to get IG to go back to what I feel
is the correct configuration, the one Bill and I intended. (BTW, with
the single exception of the incorrect dewclaw, Vilardi\'s Aslan comes
the closest to what Bill and I had in mind.) Just imagine Alsan having
a switchblade instead of the last bone in their thumb.

Yes, but many of these operations aren\'t automated right now.  And 
machine tool companies aren\'t going to be able to build the equipment 
overnight.  You\'re talking about a tenfold increase in orders for 
most of these companies...

And you\'ve totally ignored your own premise.  We are talking about

bananas, and others just don\'t grow all that well in Nebraska).  And

on an oil derrick don\'t require some specialized skills, I\'d like to 
introduce you to a few of my uncles and cousins, who do exactly that 
sort of thing for a living...

Uh, last I knew, this was a democracy, and you can\'t draft people 
into civilian jobs.  Now admittedly, you can raise wages for such 
jobs to the point where it would be more attractive, and this is what 
would happen long term, but you don\'t draft people to work for 
Anaconda...

I will concede this point.  But remember a lot of the UMW folks have

enough that they\'d have a hard time finding their union cards...

I\'m sure the governor of your state is going to love shipping the

Yeah, well the same WOULD be said if we lost access to large amounts

Yeah, but you\'re asking plants to produce several times as much stuff 
as they would now...  Even if you run three shifts (which you aren\'t 
now), you\'re looking at hiring a lot of people, and would be directly 
competing for the same blue collar guys who are being "drafted" to 
work in the mines...

What are you smoking????  Man I want to live in your world...  There 
are about 260 million people in the US.  There are 5 BILLION people 
in the rest of the world.  Unemployment is currently running at 4.5%. 
 There aren\'t that many people who are free to ship off to take ALL 
those jobs in the rest of the world...at least not without having to 
be replaced at home...  And incidentally, you\'re going to need MORE 
of them to do the same jobs that are done over here, due to lack of 
automation, support services...

Yeah, I remember all those Model T\'s they used to crank out in the

Yes, a lot of people went to the Congo, etc. but nowhere near as many as 
there were natives in most of those places...

Wow, Leonard we agree on something...  They\'re going to be paying

First of all, I sald they\'d be importing technology, if you\'d taken 
the time to read the rest of my response, but they aren\'t going to 
have the manpower to devote to manufacturing it locally, at least not 
early on.  They are going to have to import it.

Utter nonsense.  We\'ve been mining and shipping ore for 5000 years.  
All you need is the mines, and a flat space of rock for ships to land 
on...and some sort of vehicle/animal power to carry it from the mines 
to the ships.  Heck, even low tech, you could simplify things.  Just 
put the starport next to the mine...

Yes, but remember, the Imperial model doesn\'t work AT ALL like this.  
There are definitely low tech mining colonies, and for the most part, 
you don\'t need weather satellites, shuttles, et al.  Especially if 
your mining operations are concentrated in 1 small corner of the 
world, which is most likely going to be what happens in the 
beginning...

Irrelevant to the main argument...

On a new mining colony, there aren\'t going to be a whole lot of areas 
where there is agriculture or industrial production.  Take a look at 
mining towns in the US.  Most of them are mines, homes for the 
workers, and restaurants, markets, bars, etc. to service the 
miners...that\'s about all...  

I know what I\'m speaking about here.  I have a pair of uncles who

If there are housing materials and food to produce...  Not too much lumber on 
them vacuum worlds...  You could use the local rock, but you\'d still 
need materials to hold it together...would the planet have lime?  As 
for agriculture, I would agree, but again, not as much as you think 
early on in either sector and maybe none at all if the world doesn\'t 
have them...

Wait a minute.  This is a mining colony...the analogy is a mining 
town, not Detroit...  They aren\'t going to be able to produce 
everything early on, their main focus is to mine those rare elements 
for the developed industrial world which is Jump-2 away, not to build 
their own industry...

No, you\'re argument is full of economic holes.  I do agree with you 
on people being the expensive resource.  But remember, a while ago 
you were telling me we were going to be drafting miners...kind of 
going against your own argument...

This would depend on the hospitality of the world.  The reason I 
suggest it would be lower tech is because it would be cheaper to 
sustain the technology locally, without increasing imports beyond 
already high levels...

Perhaps, I had a poor choice of words.  Should have used mature, 
instead of established...  By mature, I mean, most of the original 
mines are played out, new ones have been established, infrastructure 
is thoroughly established, manufacturing and other industries have 
been established for some time, population is relatively stable, 
etc...

Not any tech level.  Some maybe.  It is not a coincidence that the 
industrial revolution occurred only after the population was closing 
in on 2 billion people.

Remember the color box illustration with the three(?) guys in jumpsuits 
outside ruins of a city?  If memory serves, one guy is holding a laser rifle, 
and one is holding a hand-held device of some kind.  

I guess that was the first edition.  I was in sixth grade and the only other 
RPG I played was (of course) D&D.  In addition to a friend from down the 
street, I actually played Gamma World with a MY DAD (who was ref)!  My dad was 
a traditional wargamer before, but he influenced my role playing style ever 
since.  He designed different levels of maps, and had a hand-drawn 
illustration for nearly every encounter.  By the time we eventually quit 
playing, my friend and I both had notebooks with a pictorial "storyline" of 
our adventure.  We could flip through the folder and discuss what we did at 
each scene.  

I would look at Metamorphosis Alpha many times at Toys By Roy (remember Toy 
Stores selling RPGs?)  But I never bought it, probably because I was buying 
lots of D&D products at the time.

Of course, it was around the time that we quit playing Gamma World, when I 
noticed a guy in my orchestra class with three plain black books, and a very 
compelling radio message from Free Trader Beowulf on the back...

Hmmm. Speaking of lawful, upright characters: I /really/ want to respond 
to this, but I also fear it could easily degenerate into a flame war.  
Since I\'m not feeling extremely lawful and upgright today (grin), I\'ll go 
ahead and speak my peace. :)

What you say is true:  referees should not be contrained to the results 
dictated by dice throws.  However, I\'ve learned that going with the dice 
throws, even when the consequence is death for a player character or 
major NPC, can provide wonderful role-playing experiences.

I\'m not advocating letting the dice rule the game.  I\'m just saying that 
throwing out every dice throw that leads to major negative consequences 
for the PCs is not a perfect policy.  Some great experiences can be 
missed that way.

Example:  One PC, Scardin, was enamored of a housekeeper (named "Babe," 
after a schoolmate of mine).  They met when she cleaned his room the 
first time.  She was new to the job, and sort of barged in without 
checking whether the room was empty.  Babe was very apologetic, so Scardin 
let her go about her tasks while he did his own "housekeeping" - cleaning 
his guns, etc.  
	She got into trouble with the vacuum cleaner, sucking up some 
stray bits of equipment that had been left on the floor.  When the 
machine screetched its complaint at these foreign objects, she panicked 
and got herself into more of a mess.  Scardin helped clear up the 
problem, more from wanting this interruption to be over with than out of 
genuine friendliness.  
	Once she finished vacuuming, she went to clean the bathroom.  As 
Scardin finished up his own task, he noticed a particularly noxius smell 
drifting into the room.  Babe had mixed some cleaning products that were
not meant to be mixed, and had passed out in the bathroom.
	To make a long story short, Scardin found he liked this 
accident-prone woman, and they began seeing eachother socially.  After 
time, they became lovers.
	That was, of course, just a sub-plot.  The main story involved 
Scardin\'s enforcement activities for one of the local organized crime 
outfits.  I decided it was time to "turn the screw" a little tighter on 
Scardin\'s life, so I had a rival gang attempt a "hit" on him.  I didn\'t 
want the character to die...I just wanted him to be shaken up and wonder 
which rival syndicate was after him.
	So, one night while Scardin was out "at work," I had a hit man 
make a rather messy attempt on him.  The hit man stopped by Scardin\'s 
room, opened the door, crept into the darkened room, and let go with a 
shotgun - he emptied it into the bed.
	Now, I figured this would be effective.  Scardin comes home, 
finds his bed turned into little pieces of cloth and fluff, and thinks 
about how easily that could have been the end of his life.
	Unfortunately, Scardin left the house for his next job at the end 
of one session, and the hit happened at the beginning of the next.  I 
didn\'t take proper notes, so I forgot that, earlier the same evening the 
hit occurred, he had gone out with Babe.  She\'d gotten a bit drunk, and 
he\'d left her at his place, passed out on his bed.
	The player brought up this fact when Scardin came home to the 
ruined bed.  "Where\'s Babe?"  
	I thought...oh, God!  Invent something really lame: "She was in 
the bathroom at the time," or go with what should have really 
happened: she was out cold, and never even woke up.  All that is left of 
her body is a bunch of bloody pieces.
	I went with what made sense, even though it filled me with 
dread.  The relationship had been developing very nicely, and it was a 
fun sub-plot to explore.  Now it was over.
	And you know what?  That was one of the most effective pieces of 
plotting I ever did - even though I never intended to.  It was a defining 
moment of Scardin\'s life, and changed the game-play dramatically, 
affecting it in ways too numerous to go into now.
	For the player and I, it was a role-playing session we will 
never forget.  This scenario was played a dozen years ago, yet 
the feeling and memories are as vivid as if it had really happened.  Not 
many role-playing experiences have that sort of impact.

Now, this wasn\'t a case of listening to the dice.  However, if a 
character attempts something very risky, and the dice tell you the worst 
happens, think about it before you make your decision.  Or, if logic tells 
you something terrible is at least very likely to happen as a consequence 
of some other action, perhaps it will be best to let that thing happen.  If 
not overdone, you can lead yourself and your players down some new paths 
that can be very memorable indeed.

That wasn\'t Michael Vilardi, that was Rob Caswell.  I would honestly

about their art.

Just so you know, you can catch Vilardi\'s work all over the Star Wars
RPG.  Rob Caswell and Dave Deitrich freelance, but their work can also
be seen in various SW RPG products as well.

Now, I\'m not busting on Foss or Elmore, I happen to like what they\'ve
done as well (just not as much as the aforementioned).

This is the only way I have ever been able to run Traveller.  I will go a 
step further and say that I have great difficulty running any game with a 
critical mass of less than three people.  This is true of any game I run, 
but seems to be especially true when I run Traveller.  I much prefer the 
players to have their own goals and look on my job as creating the 
atmosphere and frontier feel of the game.  I have never been able to 
tolerate the story telling type of game as a player, and view it as too 
constraining for them.  If a game master wants to write a book, as I have 
often found from game masters running story telling games, then they can 
leave me out of it.  Just my humble opinion.

  Probably just good old fashioned discipline.

  A friend of mine who joined the Canadian Army Engineers a few months ago
tells me his buddies are useless at gaming - they all generate "super
marine" killing machines and get off on blowing the entire adventure up.
It\'s turned him off gaming entirely until he gets regular leaves with his
old gaming buddies.

  Not true. In fact, the Sheffield did not detect the Exocet at all until
just before impact. It isn\'t really known for sure _why_ they didn\'t
detect it, but another ship in the line *did* see it, but for some reason
did not warn the Sheffield. A combination of factors (ie, one big
clusterfuck) resulted in the loss of the Sheffield - IFF wasn\'t one of
them.

Exactly.  The trick then becomes "don\'t let your player\'s begin to think
that you (as a referee) would ever let BLANK happen to one of their
players, no matter what the die roll."  This can lead to players repeatedly
"pushing the envelope" as they try to get away with dangerous events--
knowing that you will not let anything bad happen to them.

This is an important thing for a referee to remember.  Since different
players have different skill levels when it comes to role-playing, care
must be given that the skilled players do not dominate the game due to
their familiarity with both the system and role-playing in general.  The
reverse is rarely the case, although some seasoned gamers might grow a bit
irritated at the lack of participation and subsequent hand-holding required
of a new player (kind of like how we all feel when stuck behind a student
driver).  Role-playing is a group experience and there will always be
different levels of skill since the game does not specifically demand it
(contrary to professional sports or driving the Indy circuit, where the
goal is to be *better* than your opponents).

Introducing a player that has never role-played before and watching his/her
response to the situation can be priceless.  The event can become even
greater when that player decides to play again next session.  The hardest
part I fond is explaining to new players how the campaign world is
different than our own REAL LIFE.  Referees keep a lot of info stored in
their brains about how their world operates; sometimes one forgets what the
players have been told and what they have not.

Campaigns I have run (and have participated in) generally revolve around a
l-o-n-g campaign thread which can become dominant at some points in the
campaign while nearly disappearing at other times.  During *these* times,
players have been known to start serious relationships with NPCs (and even
other PCs), open businesses, join therapy groups, tour, make new friends &
contacts, and even play other games (within the role-playing game itself,
complete with their own rules).

Our current Shadowrun campaign began with a shootout inside a Kwiky Mart
(would you like a Squishy?) where a gang of thugs tried to get protection
money from the store owner.  Our seven PCs met for the first time during
that gunfight, and we later became known as the KMS (Kwiky Mart Seven).  A
lot of things have happened since then (you know-- save the city a few
times and such) but we are still known as the KMS.  Each PC is involved in
events that don\'t necessarily involve the rest of the players.  We even
have our own franchise to act as our clubhouse (something for the "bad
guys" to blow up, of course).

The trick is knowing when to wean them off... too soon and they might
become disappointed in their character\'s performance; too late and they
might not be ready to finally suffer the consequences when their character
makes a critical OOPS!

One thing I find that helps out a lot is for the players to create a
written background for their characters (one page minimum).  Traveller
covers a lot of this during character creation but only covers things on a
year-by-year basis (and pretty much ignores a character\'s pre Collage or
University years).  The more in depth the background is, the better.  It\'s
like the difference between a movie *with* character developement and those
with little or none.  It might even be possible for the referee to subtly
interweave his/her campaign plot into the character\'s background without
them even knowing it!

I just had a vision of Carole on a *teeny* pink bicycle and wearing a white
safety helmet-- her tongue firmly in cheek as she tries to concentrate over
Joe\'s cheers of encouragement.  Right behind her is Joe, running along side
with one hand on the back of the banana seat as he watches her progress,
the little multi-coloured streamers on the handle bars fluttering in the
wind as she approaches 0.1c  :-)

And as long as a referee doesn\'t favour one player over another because of
their role-playing skills (or lack thereof), everyone should be happy.  No
one should feel left out just because their role-playing skills aren\'t as
strong as everyone else\'s.  The object of the experience is for everyone to
have fun... not determine who is the best role-player.

Actually, I played Gamma World 1 time.  1st edition as I recall...  
FWIW, I mainly recounted it just to show that there wasn\'t a whole

Don\'t recall Metamorphosis: Alpha, but its been about 17-18 years

I don\'t think we will have to.  As I said in my long response, don\'t 
throw away every die roll...just consider it before you do so.
Which is exactly what you said you do.
So, there is no disagreement. :)

This is one of the things I\'ve been giving alot of thought to recently.  
Because I mostly play with either one or two players, I have avoided allowing 
a scenario to culminate in the death of one of the PCs (thinking that I will 
allow the PC to die if the player does something REALLY stupid).  I\'ve been 
thinking that I will abandon that practice, becuase it does set up a bad 
precedent, ie. if you "preserved" my PC last time, why not this time, or every 
time?

If death of PCs occur more often, then it won\'t be so bad.  But allowing a 
player to get "attached" to his PC believing death to be impossible, is a bad 
way to go.  After a player loses a few PCs, on the other hand, it will just 
become part of the game.  But I agree with someone in a previous email who 
said that he prefers games with more than 3 players.  With that many or more 
players involved, individual deaths become less "significant" and the actual 
adventure itself becomes what is important.  I have heard of a game in which 
PCs were killed so often that the players all finished the adventure with 
different PCs than they started; except one -- each PC dropping out and 
"handing off" the ongoing storyline to another slightly different group.  The 
moral being that the "story" or adventure is what is important -- and not any 
pasrticular PC or PCs.

This runs counter to what I am used to, since my campaigns tend to center 
around the characters rather than any particular outcome.  But it is food for 
thought.

Yikes!  You\'re kidding, right?  Or am I misunderstanding you?  You seem 
to be saying that new players tend not to know the difference between 
fantasy an reality.  I must be sloooooooow today....that can\'t be right.

Neat. :)  I\'ve never done the game-within-a-game, but it is a neat idea.

And the idea of "down time" is interesting as well.  The most down time 
my players\' characters get is typically no more than a week or so.  Not 
long enough to open a business or take a tour. :)
Perhaps I should give that a try sometime.

This worked with my old group, and it is generally a good idea.  But, 
some new players have trouble doing even this much. :(  They need lots o\' 
hand-holding.

Yup.  Just like with any other management task.  That\'s a dry way of 
putting it, I know, but the similarity is there.  You should treat 
everyone equally.

You are so right, Boyd.  Early on in my gaming experience (back in the days 
when I thought D&D was the only role-playing game worth spending time 
on[G]), I sort of forced our group to deal with this issue.  

Since we were all around 12 or so, none of us was mature enough to deal 
with the death of a character.  Fortunately, neither I nor the other 
person acting as DM ever killed a PC.  At worst, it was a "...and you 
barely survive" situation.

Well, one session my magic-user character was being threatened by a big 
baddie in a dungeon.  He was taunting my character, telling me how he was 
going to kill me, etc. etc.  My character was completely helpless in the 
situation.

I reacted completely immaturely to that, of course. :)  I "broke the 
fourth wall" to a degree and had my m/u talking directly to the DM, 
saying essentially, "You aren\'t going to kill me, because you CAN\'T kill 
a PC.  So just make this guy shut up and let me go!"

Unfortunately, the DM didn\'t react any better than I did.  He backed 
down, and followed our unspoken agreement that no PC would be killed.  

The exchange could have caused our group to mature, but the DM and I 
didn\'t handle it right. :(  It wasn\'t until a couple of years later, with 
the death of Babe, that we finally changed that policy.

It\'s a fine line to walk.  You want the players to be "attached" to their 
characters, to a degree.  You want them to care about what happens to 
their characters.  Heck, you want them to /be/ their characters during 
the play session, just as a good actor becomes his character.

But, as you point out, you don\'t want them to become so attached to their 
character that they won\'t accept its death. 

Our group called it "maturity," but that probably isn\'t the right term.

For us, the /experience/ became the most important aspect.  The feelings, 
thoughts, and images that the characters and situations evoked were of 
paramount importance.  That opened up new avenues for us.

I\'ve never taken it to this extreme.  PC deaths were rare, but they 
happened.  Make them too often, and they have no emotional impact.  Since 
we were most interested in experiences, this was not a route that was 
explored.  It just wouldn\'t have been effective /for us/.

You\'re right, it is.  Something to think about.

I disagree on this one.  (Of course I do, I was the ref!)  Sometimes 
you _have_ to let the dice take their course; otherwise players fall 
into a safety-net mentality, which also leads to abuse.  If a player 
does something really stupid and is not punished for it, he will either 
repeat mistakes or develop a \'what does it matter it\'ll be OK anyways\' 
mentality.

If the event in question would have damaged the campaign I wouldn\'t 
have allowed it.  Instead, it simply takes things in a radical new 
direction while denying the players one or two potentially easy (if 
also sleazy) methods of getting ahead of the game. . .

I have a problem with the map of the core subsector in T4.  Actually I
have several problems with it, including a number of typos, but the most
important difficulty is that the map does not seem to fit canon. 
According to my trusty font of Traveller dogma, the Imperial
Encyclopedia, the Sylean Federation had been around several centuries
before Cleon declared the 3rd Imperium into existence, and it was supposed
to comprise a whole sector at that time.  So why are there "unexplored"
planets on the map?  Is this a map from before the Syleans took over the
rest of the sector?  In that case, it is not from year 0, as some seem to
have assumed (including myself) but from at least -500.  Thoughts?

I remember one discussion where the Aslan used the

They couldn\'t fire *unless* the dewclaw was pressing

I think of it as this.  The Syleans may have occupied the sector for a
while, but who\'s to say they were interested in planets without people.
Now, I don\'t have T4 to look at the map, but if you think about it, Humans
were on this planet for a lot longer than 500 years, with the ability to
explore the whole Earth, but didn\'t do it.  

Perhaps fear and superstitions built up over the Long Night about certain
places even may have played into this, or maybe the Syleans wer eonly
interested in planets that would prove economically viable.  Like any
government would they support a scouting expedition that wouldn\'t prove to
be rewarding?  The answer is no.

Thanks,

Peter

Universe with 3 players. The mission had to do with finding something on a
space ship (something like a cruse ship), it had to be found before the
ship got to its destination (about 3 weeks). At one point early in the game
I rolled a "Major Accident". In Universe a major accident is a life
threatening incident that bears no relationship to the plot. The player
gets a saving throw (something around 20%), if he fails he takes LOTS of
damage.

The rules said this accident was to occur sometime in the next 8 game
hours... Well earlier in the game, the randomly chosen character, who was
to receive the accident result, was being pestered by a small child on one
of the observation decks, so while he was walking up a spiral staircase
sneaking around the ship, I had him slip on some stray marbles left by the
kid. He fell down the stairs and ended up out for several hours.

The major accidnet was a 1% chance but I let it stand even though it had no
bearing on the plot, could not be avoided through careful playing by the
player and had the potential (with only 3 players) of ruining their chances
of succeeding in the scenario. I think most GMs would have dumped the
result or re-rolled.

Once the other PCs found the hurt PC, the players spent the next several
(real) hours trying to devise a plan to sneak their fallen comrade back to
his cabin and get him the medical attention he needed. They couldn\'t allow
anyone else on the ship to know why they were sneaking around that part of
the ship you see.

The entire sub-plot and all of the complications involved with his
recuperation (he knew things about the ship but couldn\'t get out of bed to
act on his knowledge) would have been lost if I had dumped a die-roll
simply because I was afraid of the result.

In my game, if you are driving down the road in a car, you could have an
accident and be killed. Even if you are chasing the big bad guy and are
trying to save millions of innocent lives! :-)

I find that the dice make the game more unpredictable. For me as GM, an
unpredictable game is a fun game. Throw away dice results, and you throw
away the fun.

I\'ve got a slightly different set of questions to pose...

Have any of you ever had a PC *kill* another PC?  

Have you ever done it yourself?  

As a GM would you let it happen, and how would you handle the
aftermath?  Divine retribution? <g>

- --Webster\'s Dictionary--

dewclaw.  1) a functionless digit on the foot of some animals, as on the
inner side of a dog\'s hind leg.  2) the claw or hoof at the end of such a
digit.

Here\'s the way I picture it.  The Aslan have 5 digits, with the outer two
being opposable thumbs.  One of those thumbs, I\'ve always pictured it being
the outer but the inner would work too, is a small nub that has no real
function in modern Aslan other than to house a long dewclaw.  During a
fight the Aslan clench their fists and the claw extends beyond their hands
like a short dagger.  With the hand open the extended dewclaw doesn\'t
usually get in the way, and they can keep it retracted anyway.  

If you want to humanize it, clinch your fist and extend your little
finger..that\'s where and the length the dewclaw would be, IMO.  <g>

What a surprise! And, of course, the bank executive being a particularly 
clever bank executive expected that to happen, because it more often 
than not does, and used his good reputation and that of his associates 
to insure the vessals non-existant cargo for a very large sum. yes?

Players have faced a similar situation in one of my campaigns but they 
solved it by rigging up high-pressure oxygen jets which they ran at 
very high pressure till the ships supply was depleted. This controlled 
vent altered their course enough for them to be catapulted past the 
planet. The whole thing depended, of course, on the terminal velocity of 
the ship when its thrust died. 
Another trick as a last resort (this was kept as plan B by my players)is 
to by-pass the integrity controls on an outer airlock hatch and 
explosively decompress a section of the ship, preferably a section of 
the ship with a large airlockway (say cargo) and few obstacles to the 
rapid escape of the atmosphere bubble.
The weakness of plan B is the short duration and uncontrolled nature of 
the vent. The ship could begin to roll,yaw and pitch and oxygen jets 
might need to be used to right that.

Yes.  More than once.

>Have you ever done it yourself?

Yes.  We had crashed on this low-tech world, and while we were waiting for
friendly forces to find us, one of the PCs got bored and persisted in going
out of his way to antagonize the locals (shot up a couple of cars, stole
some cattle, shot the sheriff when he came out to protest).  When he
kidnapped the daughter of the local priest-queen, I busted in on them in
his stateroom before he could make matters even worse for us (the locals
expressed their displeasure by bracketing our crippled ship with a warning
artillery barrage) and executed him with a pistol shot to the back of the
head.  It took a lot of talking (and agreeing to do a drop into a rival
temple and liberate an artifact) before she let us off the hook.

Yes, we had some tl 13 weaponry and equipment, but the 12 surviving guys in
our company could only hold out so long against a (very angry) tl 7 force.

The other player was plenty pissed about it, but my character *had* warned
him that I wasn\'t going to let him get my team killed.  I even got
acquitted at the court martial.

>As a GM would you let it happen, and how would you handle the
>aftermath?  Divine retribution? <g>

I had a similar situation occur in a game I was running, and I let one PC
whack another PC who was acting stupid (guy was playing a pyromaniac with
demo-4, which would have been no problem if he hadn\'t had a hobby of
blowing up police cruisers).  I had to keep the deader from exacting
vengeance with his new character, though.

One of the players had been with our group long enough that it was
impractical to try and boot him, and the other guy was the roommate of the
guy whose dorm we gamed in.

If the situation came up again, I\'d do what I always do - make sure there
is an in-character reason for the action, try to talk them out of it, and
very probably let it happen.  I very probably wouldn\'t let a player who\'s
only sitting in for one session kill a long time pc, but I can\'t see not
allowing it if there is a really good in-character reason.

Conflict is central to adventure after all.

Oh, no, that is an excellent term.  I debated about using it in my previous 
post...  but I didn\'t want to sound snooty...<g>

I think it is one of the reasons my initial gaming group died out.  Our games 
began to take on a sameness about them and no one developed their role-playing 
skills to the degree that death is an accepted, though undesireable, 
possibility within the game.  Not the only reason the group died out, but when 
the risk is low, the excitement seems to lessen to a degree also.

Now, I would encourage the players _grow up_ and role play the entire 
scenario, death and all.  Disputes are fine, but hopefully the players will be 
mature enough to role-play their dispute as well -- making an interesting game 
all around.

BTW:  Good question, Eris!

If you can\'t seduce your straight-laced players into illegal activity,
you\'re not doing your job as a referee.  You might read a few spy novels
- -- or true spy stories -- for some ideas. 

One approach is for a patron to offer fair compensation for work that is
legitimate here on planet A -- but the work is to be done on planet B. 
When the PCs do the work on planet B, they\'re subject to whatever problems
with local laws you want them to experience.  Planet B should of course be
a place that they have to visit regularly for campaign reasons.  Now every
time they go there they have to evade the law, which is a crime in itself. 
Within a short time, you should have them willing to summon Mephistopheles
and sell their souls to get out -- er, wrong game -- but you get the idea. 

You do need to exercise a little sublety.  "Would you take this cargo of
perfectly legal concealable firearms to the law level 7 planet on your
next trip?" won\'t do it.  "Would you please spend an hour with my elderly
aunt in the nursing home while you\'re on planet B, and tell her that
you\'ve seen me and that I send my love," might. 

I think that I would tend to rise to this challenge, but it\'s never
occurred.  Eight months?  Maybe the player is a criminal in real life, and
is looking for an escape.

    'body' => 'TRAVELLER SUITE - A collection of on-line utilities for Traveller
    For EuroGenCon-96 I produced a demo version of a concept
for a Traveller Suite, similar in market positioning to the
recently released TSR CD-ROM. The features of the demo included:
    * On-line rules
    * On-line library data
    * Star maps of the imperium allowing viewing from sector
down to system level.
    * Character and NPC design and generation
    * Starship construction
    * Animal Encounter generation
    * Ship Deckplan Design
    * Planetary Map Editing
    * Language Handout Editing
    * Trade Account Management
    * A dice roller (including 1/2 d6 support)

   The demo elicited a very positive reaction from both players and
distributors and I received a large number of requests to make
this demonstration publicly available.
    Additionally Imperium Games have given us the go-ahead to take
this to the level of a potential product. We are currently in
discussions with them about licensing considerations and market
positioning.
    Although no one actually managed to crash the software while on
display (although many tried!) it is still only an alpha test
version. Its main purpose is to solicit feedback on what a final
product should look like and include.
    In order to best gather this response I would like to set up
a web site containing a number of pages:
    * A release page for ease of access
    * A user feedback page where people can add their comments and
suggestions
    * A Known Bugs and Workaround page where users can track problems
in the alpha version and how to live with them.
    Due to access problems I cannot maintain these pages from my
current account. I would be highly appreciative of any volunteers
from out there who can set this up for me!

    The development manager of this software is Jo Grant who can be
reached at jo_grant@crd.lotus.com. The project manager is Andy Lilly
who can be reached at A.S.Lilly@nortel.co.uk. This product is brought
to you by the CORE Traveller development group, in association with
Imperium Games, and is intended to compliment our range of upcoming
Traveller supplements.

HomeBoyd asked about legal PCs etc and FWIW, in a mini
adventure I ran for the lady who drives me to work each day,
(one way to pass a hour\'s car journey each way I guess!), she
played a police \'agent\' (from the High Passage no. 1 character
generation) who was never (it seemed) going to break the law
despite all the provocation given her.

Of course, with no other PCs to sway her morals it wasn\'t
that surprising.  Still, I was gratified at her comment when
she finished that she could "see what the attraction was"
(she\'d only asked to \'play\' to find out what on earth I went
on about all the time!).

Anyone else want to contribute to the "Odd places to play

As a matter of some substantial and undeniable fact the people of China, 
the former Soviet Union, India, parts of Africa and Latin America have 
indirectly contributed a great deal to the maintenance of "your" tech 
level through one simple process in many forms. FEAR. Fear of so many 
supposed enemies has driven the arms race and military research and 
development. The military has been the largest source of scientific and 
technological research and development in the last 50 years. The biggest 
irony is that Japan now has a startegic corner on the semi-conductor 
market to such an extent that the US Government had to set up its own 
semi-conductor factory so as not to compromise its strategic military 
pieces by reliance on Japanese supplied semi-conductors. That particular 
factory has now been closed down because it was so uneconomic.

Don\'t kid "yourself" chuck.

Yes, but that was only early on.  Our group was fairly boring in that

Nah.  When I played, I threatened to kill a couple of PC\'s if they didn\'t 
quit being idiots, but that was about it.

Sure I\'d let it happen, so long as it made sense for the character to do 
the killing.  If, on the other hand, the player was just angry at the 
other player and decided to kill his character, I\'d probably talk to the 
players in question first.  If they couldn\'t resolve their dispute 
without disrupting the game, I\'d have to ask them not to play anymore.

I think I\'d be able to do that.  I\'ve never had to kick someone out of a 
game, though.

  {
    'body' => 'Hi all.

I ran a short, impromptu T4 game last night. A few questions arose partly
as a result, and partly from reading of the rulebook:


Tasks
=====

One character, having had much more beer than was good for him, (or anyone
else), attempted to drive the PC\'s van down the road. I thought: Ok, normally
an Easy skill, but he is completely out of his tree, lets make it Staggering
(3.5D). This character has a Dex of 10 and a drive of 1. So his target is
11. Well the average of 3.5D is 12.5, so the chances of him succeeding are
around 50%, which seems way too high...ok, I could have made it Impossible
(4D, average 14), or given minuses to the Dex or target number. In fact of
course I fudged it to make it interesting...but given that an average PC
can expect an attribute of 7-8, and a skill of 2-3, then Impossible tasks
don\'t exactly seem too impossible. ("The thing about million to one chances
is that they come up nine times out of ten").


Vehicles and Robots in Combat (p59)
===================================
   This section talks about damage to superstructure, power plant, locomotion
   or mounted devices. However, the vehicles given in the rules have no
   rating for any of these values, although they do have an armour rating.

   Is the comment about damage left over from MT? I seem to remember very
   similar wording. The Armour rating would also presumably protect against
   damage to the superstructure, power plant etc,etc, as above.

Laser Pistol (p74/p80)
======================
   In the text, it says that the Laser Pistol has a damage rating of 6.
   In the weapons table it says 4. I guess 4 is the correct number...


   Also, the Range column in the weapons table. Is this referring to the
   maximum ranges for these weapons? The discussion of combat (p55/p56)
   seems to imply that the only use for these range ratings is as a modifier
   for aimed attacks. But then why not just give the modifier, rather than
   the range which then has to be converted to a number on the range table?

Standard Military Laser Batteries (p110)
========================================
   TL 11 with 10 Wpns. Should the USP be: 12-9-5-3 (?)

Space Combat (p117)
===================
   Step 1: Task Force Assembly. What is the reason for dividing your ships
   into Task Forces? It doesn\'t seem to have any further effect in the rules,
   and in the case of determining Range, how does this work? You cannot easily
   keep track of ranges for seperate Task Groups. Or are all Task forces
   assumed to be at the same range?

   Step 3: Range. "If an entire Task Force consists of ships under 50 tons, it
   can close to Very Short Range and all ships in the Task Force may use point
   defence weapons. This is known as fighter strafing". Does the closing happen
   in 1 turn? (Presumably). How is using point defence weapons any different
   from using ships weapons normally?


Any thoughts?

cheers,

Shack was conducting the interrogation. I chose to give the teen some attitude,

In my experience, at least with the group I am privileged to play with

work on their characters, identify with them, flesh them out etc.  
Definitely get attached to them, in short.

That said, I think every single one of them would have been disappointed

I will be adding an option to export a set of HTML files - haven\'t yet
decided is one HTML file per planet or one HTML file per system is the way to
go.  Suggestions?

Graphics will be harder.  I am using cicns, which means that the usual \'write

Yup.  Choose Black & White under view.  This is actually a misnomer, because

The same thing happened when a much beloved NPC in a Fantasy game I was 
ref\'ing was killed.  Debryndd of Rhyanedd, she\'d been around for years, 
like everyone\'s little sister, they\'d saved her life in the first part so 
there was an immediate bond.  No one ever stepped over the line with her. 
 She got trapped on an upper balcony with a particularly fearsome 
Orbaalese warrior, the PC\'s were fighting below and they had to watch her 
die.  It\' was pretty horrible because they couldn\'t get up there and save 
her.
 
>I\'ve got a slightly different set of questions to pose...

>Have any of you ever had a PC *kill* another PC?

Yes, I was the first PC who killed another.  It was pretty devestating.
 
>Have you ever done it yourself?

We all decided there was no way I could know what had transpired twenty 
seconds before as he ran down the hall.  We were in RCES body sleaves, he 
had gone towards the exit of this sewer system we were in while I waited 
behind to see who was following us.  I got into a fire fight and he came 
running back, on the was back he "pulled his tabs".  For those of you who 
don\'t know RCES body sleaves have autoinjectors which pump you full of 
pain killers and stimulants, which for ten minutes reduce all injuries to 
nil and wake you right up.

Anyways\' the fight goes on and he gets knocked out.  I drag him around a 
corner and immediately pull his tabs again to wake him up, unaware he\'s 
already done this.  Grumble (Sean) fails his endurance roll and his heart 
explodes when the extra batch of stimulants burst into his system.  I 
dragged his body out of the sewers and across a ten kilometer wide 
no man\'s land on my belly.  I felt just awful, and my character has since 
this gone slightly loopy.  Unable to preform any kind of spiritual 
cleansing ritual, Voodoo is Spiri, this whole incident has weighed 
greatly upon our soul.  Of course the fact the the GM delights in rubbing 
it in doesn\'t help much.
 
>As a GM would you let it happen, and how would you handle the
>aftermath?  Divine retribution? <g>

As a GM of course I\'d let it happen.  Personally Voodoo has stepped out 
and gotten extremely blotto in an attempt to purge the sins...

When I moved to Bristol about nine years ago, there were five stores
that sold role-playing games, two model shops, a "Virgin Games Store",
a "Games Workshop" (who had about a stand and a half of other peoples
games), and a comic shop that also did games.  The model shops stopped
doing games about seven years ago, just slightly after "Games Workshop"
stopped doing other peoples games.  The comic store reduced their
range about five years ago to the point where they just seemed to be
selling off old stock, and Virgin have since changed their policy to a
central ordering scheme where only head office orders games, and those
are all AD&D or WW.

I now live in Coventry, we have a Virgin store and a Games Workshop.
The only real game shop I know in the West Midlands area is in
Birmingham (Dungeons & Starships), nowhere else seems to do games any
more.

college, with several of my friends and my girlfriend (who now happens
to be my wife). I wanted to start a campaign in a totally different setting (I
computer-generated a sector of data and wrote up a short history), but I
used the old CT adventure, *The Chamax Plague*, to get the campaign
started. I have always loved this adventure: it is the perfect "starter"
adventure, action-packed, but with several hooks to get a group started. 

Anyway, if anyone recalls the details to the adventure, the group is called
to investigate why the mining corporation in the system has lost contact
with a scientific expedition it sent to the only habitable planet in the
system (called Chamax). To make a long story short, the players arrive on
the planet to find it a desolate wasteland. They find the expedition\'s ship,
but there are no people aboard, and the place seems deserted,
UNTIL...the acid-spitting, spider-like Chamax awake, and begin attacking
the players. One of the characters, who was extremely full of himself
because of his good looks (that\'s the way he wanted to play the
character), and who was hitting on my wife\'s character (another reason
for me, as the Ref, to be evil), got pinned down by one of these Chamax,
and was having acid spit on him for several rounds while he tried to fight
it off. My wife\'s character tried to come to his rescue, by shooting the
beast with her laser carbine (even though I warned her of the possible
consequences). The laser ripped through the beast\'s acid sac, bathing
the other character in acid.  The dice said that the character should die,
but I let him come within an inch of his life. The group promptly delivered
him to the nearest hospital facilities, where he underwent reconstructive
and bionic surgery, with physical therapy lasting for over a year.
Needless to say, they were unable to restore the character\'s good looks,
and throughout the rest of the game, that player never ceased to abuse
my wife for "saving" his character\'s life.

No, but we once had one PC beat up another.  The victim was new.  We had
encountered him in a dangerous place full of baddies, and we had (as 
characters) no reason to believe he was benevolent.  He gave cute, 
cagey answers to questions.  When our main tank-like PC lost patience 
andslapped him around, the player got incenced because he felt it was 
a universal (and, unfortunately for him, unstated) rule that PCs never 
attack one another.  The players negotiated for a while, but he left 
the game and we didn\'t miss him.

No.

"As a GM would you let it happen, and how would you handle the

I would let the consequences play themselves out in the game.  If, as 
GM, I strongly disapproved of the slaying, I might very well let the 
consequences be highly unpleasant, maybe even terminal, but it would be 
(say) arrest, trial, and execution, not bolts from the blue or sudden 
fatal accident.

Oh yeah...  As a matter of fact, I once wrote a short campaign that 
created a dynamic where everybody wanted to kill each other.

At the beginning of the campaign, I told the players that they were 
wanted by Imperial authorities for a particularly heinous act of 
piracy the subject of which had been a local Duke, which had devolved 
into cold blooded murder...

Prior to the game, I setup 1 of the players as a "ringer", an 
Imperial agent in disguise who had orders to setup the group as 
targets for assassination...  Index cards were used to communicate 
with me and each other back and forth throughout the game...

The campaign ended with the group shooting it out amongst themselves 
in the cramped hallways of the corsair they owned...  A couple of the 
characters had figured out was going on, and wound up taking sides 
with the agent...  

> Have you ever done it yourself?  

In D&D, never in Traveller, but I haven\'t played in too many 
Traveller games...just run a whole lot.  I\'ve definitely had NPC\'s 
kill off PC\'s who were doing exceptionally dumb or reckless things.  
OTOH, I\'ve occasionally ignored the odd dice roll if I thought it 
would further the campaign to do so...

> As a GM would you let it happen, and how would you handle the
> aftermath?  Divine retribution? <g>

Key point is to remove hard feelings on the part of the player whose 
character got sacrificed.  We used to have a player in our group who 
used to be rather sadistic.  His characters always had a mean streak. 
 There were times when the other PC\'s would try to kill his PC, there were 
times character would watch him start a fight, and then back away 
into the crowd, acting like they had no idea who he was...  He 
finally left our group as a mutual agreement...

If you want to get a group used to the concept of

The group I was in played "Shadows of Nyarlarothep" (sp?)
a campaign module, and I went through (I think)
8 chatacters. Runner up had 7. The most careful player
had 4 I believe. Not all of them died, mind you.
At least one was arrested and (of course) one went insane.
The joy of it all was trying to come up
with a decent explanation as to why my new character
had suddenly joined up with the group and how
to keep information flowing from one generation to another
(one guy sent everything he found to his uncle/brother/priest/
lawyer/etc, so the new characters always knew some part
of what the hell was going on).

Anyways, in some campaigns, the death of a PC can be very
traumatic. In others, it\'s a good excuse to do more silly
role-playing! (Not that I would want to run a Trav campaign
like a COC campaign, but that\'s not my point).

Well, not everything. I sent Imperium Games an e-mail questioning whether
there had been an error in the subsector map. Apparently, when compared to
the old Core Sector in the Atlas of the Imperium, the new Core Subsector
actually looks like the subsector right above it on the old map. The reply I
got was (although this is not an exact quote) "We published what Marc Miller
sent us." It then went on to say that the sector data files, and presumably
other information created by the old DGP, was now considered unofficial.
        Before anyone has a coronary, remember you were warned. It was
stated that, with the new way that the maps were going to be done for First
Survey, only the worlds known to the Sylean Federation were going to be
mapped in any detail. It makes sense to change the map as well; otherwise
players could whip out the old Atlas and have at least an idea of what is
out there.
        Another reason for this as identified by Derek Wildstar over on the
GDW-BETA list, is that the old sector maps, with the exception of the
Spinward Marches and the Solomani Rim, were generated "randomly" by
computer. The sector data done by DGP was also generated randomly. The
problem apparently lies in the random number generator; it ain\'t. Thus,
weird results occured. So, MM is apparently re-doing the areas that were
originally done automatically.
        I LIKE THIS! It makes everything new again, but doesn\'t have to
change the broad sweep of Imperial history AT ALL. We are all discovering
the Imperium for the first time again, just as our characters will. (I
expect no major changes to the Spinward Marches or Solomani Rim sectors,
though.) I also get VERY tired of this "canon" nonsense. This is a GAME, not
a religious text! The title on the book says "Marc Miller\'s TRAVELLER"; that
should tell you all you need to know.
        Finally, it\'s your campaign! If you don\'t like it, use the old maps!
IG doesn\'t have the time or the interest to hunt you down and FORCE you to
use the new maps. If "Rubicon Cross" is any indication, adventures are going
to be written to drop into any suitable planet, not for specific ones
(except maybe Sylea). No problem!
        Sorry about this being so long.

That all depends.  I once ran a campaign that was squeeky-clean.  No PC
comitted any illegal actions for the duration of the campaign.  If the
referee can\'t keep things exciting and interesting without forcing the
characters to break laws, then the referee isn\'t doing his job.

There are plenty of exciting things that can happen _to_ PCs, even if the
PCs are paying attention not to break any laws themselves.  Examples of
campaigns of this type include ones where the PCs are active-duty military,
or are law-enforcement types.

As a player, I find it an interesting challenge to pick PC "unusual" PC
traits and go with them.  For example, a character who is a doctor and
refuses to carry a sidearm.  Another character who specalized in non-lethal
weapons (he was an awfully good shot with the tranquilizer dart gun, and had
a wide variety of other things in his bag of tricks).

I\'m actually running two campaigns, which is working quite well to my
suprise.  The "Primary" campaign is set at Glisten/Glisten and is "Type
b".  The background is rich and detailed (and, so far, limited to Glisten
and other planets and habitats in the system).  The story line complex and
well laid out in advance.  The players are being (to my suprise)
cooperative in running down the leads I give them and following the plot
quite nicely.

the second adventure, which we started because we found the five players
of the primary campaign could only meet monthly at best, uses published
and internet published material with pre-generated (by me) characters
adapted for the setting (Spinward Marches, near Regina).

We have used the King Richard (from Action Aboard by FASA, circa 1983 or
so) as the first adventure, which proved quite adequate.  I prepare very
little (which leads to some improvisation) and pretty much run the
adventure out of the book.

The adventure we used to play was a long, self-directed adventure where
the players managed to steal an Ahanti High Lightnin and started rampaging
around the Trojan Reach sector, preceding  all their incursions with a
particle accelorator beam.   Classic Monty Haul in Space.  It was fun for
a while.

The classic example was when (trying to test the moral limits of the
characters) a full busload of Nuns got on the wrong end of a FGMP while
two kittens, a puppy and a woman pushing a baby carriage crossed the
street in front of it.

Those were the days!

Well, for starters, my PCs are usually in danger of killing one another 
every ten minutes or so, it seems. . .  [grin]

But seriously, yes, it has happened, in more than one game, though it\'s 
hardly commonplace.

As far as how I would handle it as a GM, it depends entirely on the 
paradigm of the game involved.  In D&D, for example, it is assumed that 
the characters are \'good\', or at least \'neutral\' the cast majority of the 
time.  The game has a certain morality built into it.

In such a game, ominous things might develop as part of the plot.  In 
Vampire, on the other hand, it isn\'t so much a matter of the game 
condoning or not condoning an action, but rather everyone (character 
doing the killing especially)\'s reactions to it.

In a game like Traveller, with a Law-Level system and more amoral (as 
opposed to immoral!) background, it would depend more on the reactions of 
those who found out, and potential legal problems.

But under no circumstances would I _EVER_ kill a character as mere divine 
retribution.  That is a serious abuse.  Players are (of course) 
tremendously undergunned vs. the referee.  if the game ever degenerates 
into an "us vs. him" mentality, everyone loses as the game becomes 
unstable and likely unenjoyable, and of course the players can\'t win that 
fight in any event which will lead to bad feelings outside the game to 
boot!

Actually, said bank executive was prepared for such an eventuality by 
including two gunners aboard the ship, ostensibly to ward off piracy.  
Well, in fact to ward off pirates. . . [g] One gunner in particular was 
an EVIL ex-marine, and could have easily held off the entire crew of PCs, 
had they done anything but accidentally burn the ship. . .

Problem here was that they had decided to hot-dog things, and so delayed 
decelerating (from awfully fast) until it would be _necessary_ to do so 
at double thrust.  Why?  I have _no_ idea!

Actually, the mian problem with that one (as I understand it from reading 
this list) is that decompression simply isn\'t that powerful a force, 
compared to the vessel\'s mass and momentum.

Which goes to prove that PCs are by FAR the most devious, inventive bunch 
of idiots the galaxy has ever seen!

Here\'s our point of contention:  My assertion is that, as tech levels 
advance, the gunner\'s job is going to become increasingly *advisory*, 
with the actual shoot/no shoot split-second decisions left to the FC 
system, simply because human reaction times will be too slow to be 
left in that loop as the pace of battle increases.  The gunner\'s role 
will be selecting targeting priorities, rates of fire, and so forth, as 
well as having override control should it happen that a "manual" shot is 
necessary.

And this may well be the case even for individual infantrymen.  Vernor
Vinge, in "Across Realtime", describes a gun which uses autotargeting to
fire only at human size/shape targets in an area.  You turn it on, then
sweep it over the desired field of fire...each time it finds itself aimed
at a human, it lobs a projectile.  The effect is like a machine gun on
full auto, but with no wasted ammo.  Needless to say, you can set it for
"real" full-auto as well; but in most cases, you let the weapon FC system
do its job.  *This* is the direction I see for infantry weapons, and
tactics.  Smarter weapons, doing more of the work, leaving soldiers free
to think on a slightly higher level, about tactics, without worrying so
much about identifying targets, aiming at them, and pulling the trigger.

Even more fun...imagine the Chips in the IFF transponders deciding they\'d 
just as soon not get turned to glowing plasma, and busily spoofing one 
another to keep the forces from engaging. :)

My point is that, as tech improves, more and more of warfare is going to 
look like short-window, point-defense combat.  In an environment filled 
with autoengaging defense systems, any vehicle or soldier who breaks 
cover is going to be pasted very quickly indeed.  This in turn demands 
that, like modern attack helicopters, vehicles *and soldiers* will need 
to fire in "pop-up" mode...break cover, fire a number of very accurate

This is what I\'m talking about in my point about "thinking tactics," 
above.  Rather than thinking about details of weapon handling, soldiers
will think about how and where to apply them.  This continues a trend
that\'s been going on for centuries; musketeers needed to think a *lot*
about the details of loading and firing their weapons, WW1 and II riflemen
less so, and users of modern light MGs, SMGs, and assault rifles even
less.

You\'ll certainly want to be able to turn *off* most of the HUD info on
demand...but other times, I think you\'ll want to see it.  Options are the
key.

Yeah, but as time goes on, they\'ll have a far better idea of where they 
are, where they\'re going, who\'s nearby, and what to expect next.  And the 
first indication of a baddie may well be their own rifle firing itself.

Yep, a couple of times.  Fortunately, it has nearly always been "death by 
accident" or "death as a consequence of foolishness/fate."  In one case, two 
PCs were clearing a house during a rescue attempt.  One team of PCs had secured 
the first floor and found the hostage; these two were detailed to clear the top 
floor to make sure the party didn\'t take fire on the way out.  Instead of 
sticking together, the PCs split up and began combat-clearing the rooms by 
lobbing a grenade in each room, entering and spraying, and then moving on.  I 
handled the two players in separate physical rooms so they would not know where 
the other was.  Sure enough, one PC heard somebody moving in a second room, 
misidentified his location on the radio to the other PC, and then proceeded to 
kick in the door and throw a grenade in.  A Combat Environment Suit is great, 
but a TL12 HEAP grenade a close range kind of vaporizes the hands and face not 
covered by the suit (as well as perforating the "protected" bits).

Another time, a group of PCs decided to "remove" an illegal MegaCorp research 
center by sabotaging its power plant for an explosion.   All well and good, but 
the guy in charge decided (for reasons I still have not clearly understood) 
that the explosion needed to be very large and dramatic, and set up a fairly 
large fission/fusion bomb (2+ megatons), with a 30-MINUTE timer.  Since it then 
took the party 15 minutes to fight their way out to the air raft (which was 
damaded; half speed), you can imagine what happened to them when the blast hit.

As for "intentional" killing of a PC by another PC, I\'ve never had that in 
Traveller.  I have had this happen once or twice in Harnmaster, but that tends 
to be a much different mindset for both players and GM.  I would be opposed to 
a PC killing another PC in Traveller, unless there was a _damned_ good reason 
for it.  I have had PCs beat each other up or drug each other, and I\'ve had a 
PC turn in other PCs for piracy, but no killings yet.

I would certainly follow through with such a PC killing, though; all of the 
consequences.  Other PCs would be expected to react appropriately, and the 
legal repercussions would still be there (most of my PCs, sad to say, have done 
some form of time, or at least shown up on wanted posters on various worlds of 
the Spinward Marches)

I started playing D&D in the 6th grade way back in 1981. I ran out and
bought the basic D&D set and my Dad got interested in it also. He was
the one who bought the Players Handbook and DM\'s Guide. We played quite
a few games, even got my sister playing for a bit.  That year for
Christmas I got the Traveller book, and we played that also, never
really had a campaign, just random adventures.  A few years ago my Dad
saw an ad for a new game, called Magic so he bought me two packs for
Christmas. He plays that now, he works for Pratt &Whitney and he plays
it at lunch with his intern, and with the guys in the Boy Scout troop
he is scout leader for.  My Dad\'s always been into games of any sort
from chess to cribbidge.  I guess I picked up that from him also, I\'ll
play any sort of game.

PS I remember going into the Hobby store to look at the D&D stuff, when
I saw the Traveller Book, I\'d flip through it, what really got my
attention was all the pictures of rifles, laser carbines, blades,
cutlasses etc.  Pretty silly  reason to buy a game, but I was only 12.

In my limited-run games, one of the PCs *is* an immortal-- 
Hi-Powered Psi with Awareness at "Immortality" levels, plus 
at various times he\'s had the cash for long-term anigathics 
use.  And then there was the couple thousand years in cold

And it all started because of a sabotaged J-drive that resulted

Which reminds me: the PC mentioned above recently awoke from a deep-

(anomalous) Theocratic Matriarchy, of extreme law level, dwelling in a 
subterranean arcology... place called Menzoberranzan.

can speak out on, because I had characters experience near death injury.

We were on our starship and my characters (yes we each played two) were in
their quarters.  The ship was attacked and we were boarded.  The ref had
designed special weapons for our main character and secretly designed a
defect into each one.  My guy got the laser pistol he had been given.  This
pistol had a knob on it where the user could adjust the power of the charge
delivered from one to 6.  I set it to 6, and it started glowing.  The ref
had made the defect in my weapon made it explode when the power was set at 6.

To make a long story short, my character threw the gun at the guy in the
door but the gun hit the door and fell to the ground in the cabin and blew
up.  The little bed in my characters\' stateroom was no where near enough to
shield them from the blast.  Rather than kill them, the ref put them in the
hospital for about three months with third degree burns covering most of
their bodies (only because the ship had an emergency lo berth).  We rolled
up some temporary characters for me to use while the others healed.

We had one character in the same group that was a bully, he always wanted to
pick a fight, so often we would let him and he would get beat up, but we
never had the characters fight each other.

The same group I played with played RoleMaster and one of the guys played a
Kinder that was always irritating the other characters.  We often wanted to
kill him, but there was always one uf us that was levelheaded. :)

This would depend on the situation.  If it is in character, then I would
allow it to happen.  As to divine retribution, I don\'t know that it would
have to be devine, most worlds have laws about killing people, and the
Character would have to face that law if he couldn\'t hide.

sessions.  Contrary to whatever slander he\'s probably been spreading, 
IT WAS NOT OUR FAULT.  It may have been extremely cool & funky, but 
we had no intention whatsoever to blow up a 40Mcr ship; it just kinda 
happened... one minute the flight crew (composed of a totally 
depraved drug-addicted nutbar of a pilot [who snores] and the totally 
blameless and all-around-nice-guy navigator [ahem]) is there ragging 
on the engineer to overload the thrusters so that they can pull a 
really studly orbital insertion, and then boom, a critical component 
burns out, multiple emergency repair attempts failed, and the 
(heroic, and almost spotless) navigator winds up talking a prolonged 
emergency EVA tethered to a distraught (but nevertheless cute) 
banker.

     It was one of the more entertaining sessions we\'ve had, too.  
And ironically, all PC\'s behaved very well: despite plans ranging 
from stealing the ship and heading for the Darrian Confederation to 
selling the bank rep and her bodyguard off for organ transplants once 
we got to Lanth to holding a wildcat strike three parsecs out in the 
middle of nowhere to just starting to slit throats just then and 
there and to hell with the consequences, we actually managed to save 
said bank rep\'s butt (well, my PC did, but he had ulterior motives
 that aren\'t suitable for a family mailing list that had to do with 
said portions of the bank rep\'s anatomy), make the 6:00 
Holovid news on Lanth, and take some time off to go hang out on the 
beach.

     And, the hilarious thing is, is that none of it was our fault, 
and even if it were, the evidence is all gone, so we\'re off scot free 
(despite the fact that we didn\'t actually do anything to begin with)

     So, we\'re out of a tiny, old, cramped 200ton freighter where the 
longsuffering navigator had to hot-bunk it with a short-tempered
 paranoid junkie pilot with poor hygiene who slept with a knife 
under his pillow, and, apparently into a 400 Ton yacht with a better
 maneuver drive, bigger lasers, and much better accomodation to boot, 
far better suited to a comfortable life of bloodthirsty pira..., er,
gentlemanly adventuring on the spacelanes.

     Just to help us not get shortchanged by Ross, does anyone have a 
good idea of how much ransom a Count would fetch?

My view on this is that my mission, as a GM, is to _entertain_. If I am not entertaining 
the players, they will go elsewhere to have fun. If I\'m not having fun, I\'ll go do 
something else that is fun. To quote McCarthy from David Gerrold\'s _War with the Cthorr_ 
cycle: "I know fun. I\'ve had fun. This isn\'t fun."

My criterion for listening to the dice is: what\'s the most fun and best for the game? 
I take the individual players in my games into account: If the _player\'s_ gaming style 
is amenable to storytelling, then I listen to the dice less; if the player is a 
by-the-book/rules-are-rules wargamer, then I let the Eculdian solids fall where they 
may. Most of my players tend toward the latter, so I spend a lot of time listening to my 
dice. The players seem to be well-entertained, as am I.

My parental and sibling units think roleplaying is an Evil Mind Control Cult(tm) or a 
College Thing(tm) I never outgrew. I have to keep making those Resist Temptation to Beat 
Crap Out Of Brother rolls every time he brings up the topic of gaming.

I _like_ that! My first CT team did something like this; gradually turning their Free

If you mean \'murder\' and \'not by accident,\' then yes! This happened in a game where the 
fast-talking businessguy tried to rip off the knuckle-dragging gun-bunnies. The latter 
exhibited a few more IQ points than the former expected to see, found out that the Suit 
was going to rip them, and the gunbunnies wired his office with a quarter-ton of 
plastique . . . instant shredded suit. As GM, I gave the victim a chance to spot the 
trap, and he blew every die roll. I took both the character\'s basic personality 
- -- paranoia and overconficence -- into consideration when deciding the outcome of this. 
The player of the dead PC took his anger out on the other players, in other games, but 
not on me (I didn\'t play in his game, being it was Hampire: The Masked Ace Raid, and I 
_hated_ WW\'s \'system.\'  I do _like_ the World of Darkness background, tho\').

>

In my first D&D game, I killed a PC, as Johnny Cash said in _Folsom Prison Blues_, just 
to watch him die. I spent my turn under the sword, too ;)

Damned right I would! And as a matter of fact, it\'s _karmic_ retribution, and I\'m not 
joking.

How do I explain this?

As a matter of religious conviction, Eris, I believe in Reincarnation and Karmic 
Justice. I hold the the effects of one\'s deeds on other people echo through and beyond 
the lifetime in which they were done. In meta-game terms, the players are the \'eternal 
souls\' of the characters they play, the part of each that breathes \'life\' into those dry 
numbers and tries to make those quantified values _real_, in a human sense. As GM, I 
play the role of "The Rest of Reality and Meta-reality," including Karma, in my game 
universe. 

I make it clear to the players that everything they do has consequences that go beyond 
the immediate, that every time the PCs decide to hurt somebody, _it had better be for 
the right reasons_. My players wind up righting a lot of wrongs; and I take the 
resulting Good Karma into account when adjudicating situations not covered by the 
rulebook. If a violent conflict arises between PCs, I take their individual acts into 
account as I adjudicate the struggle. When one dies, I tell the group, "Karmic Justice 
is a pitiless _bitch_," and let them figure it out. The dead PC often "reincarnates" as
what I call an Iago (from Iago Montoya in _The Princess Bride_ :"My name is Iago 
Montoya. You have killed my Father -- Prepare to die!") . . . . The resulting cycle is 
No Bloody Fun and is thus self-limiting.

I\'ve noted this in the one-player games I\'ve run: PCs seem to feel more likely to commit 
crimes if they are either experienced or in a group. Is this a kind of "mob mentality," 
seeking the lowest common moral denominator?

How \'bout the dining room of a Carl\'s Jr resturant or a transmission-repair shop? I\'ve

I had someone threaten to kill my PC one time.  I had borrowed an expensive
piece of equipment from her character, and it had been destroyed.  The
following week, as the session started, she told me to pay up or die.  Her
husband was the referee and they had the whole week to work out my untimely
death.  Her character was much tuffer than mine, so I talked fast and got
her to back down, much to the chagrin of her husband.  A short while later,
I noticed that my character had suddenly become very unlucky.

So I paid her off.

When I first started playing Traveller, we had one of the players threaten
to kill the referee.  That problem was not as easy to solve.

Traveller is different than most RPGs, inasmuch as a PC death does not
automatically result in the person starting over again with a weak
character.  In fact, how much adventuring you have done has little relation
to the character\'s abilities.

As a GM, I\'ve had quite a few PCs die, and from the player\'s viewport I
*killed* them, but I don\'t look at it that way.  I\'d say their lack of

I agonized about it for a day before I let my character do what he had to
do..put a phaser into the guy\'s chest and pull the trigger.  

Then the GM stepped in and arranged for my shot to miss and for him to get
away!  <Aaaargh!> Of course, he claimed it was all fair rolls on the dice,

The PC in question escaped to his own ship, where he ended up being spaced
by his own crew.

Perhaps I didn\'t make myself clear  :-)  While yes, there are players such
as you (mis)interpreted out there, my thoughts were more along the lines of
customs, morals, ethics, laws, physics, etc.  Maybe I should have phrased
it as "...different than (as well as similar to) our own REAL LIFE".  Most
people will freely admit that they know the difference between fantasy and
reality... it just isn\'t evident in their role-playing, sometimes (ie: the
murder of a "bunch of statistics representing an NPC" is rarely handled
with as much vigour as that of a "real life human being", nor are the
consequences leading up to the actual act of murder).

Many think of fantasy RPGs such as AD&D as being sooo far detached from
modern day REAL LIFE that they *automatically* assume that different
moral/ethical customs preside.  The idea of picking up a gun or a sword and
actually using it in a lethal manner is foreign to most of us, yet some
newbies seem to think that this is the "core" of what role-playing is
(probably due to the "hack & slash" mentality begun by TSR so many years
ago-- they have since grown up and have produced some thoroughly
intellectual adventures since then).  It all depends on the system and how
it is presented by the referee: Harnmaster (most notably, Lionheart) could
be considered rather "low on the fantastic" but highly accurate to
historical fantasy, while AD&D might be thought of more like an
action-packed four-colour comicbook where gold seems to be more common than
toilet paper.

When you play a traditional Traveller campaign you are usually moving
around too much (minimum distance: 1 parsec) to set up a business (you
could tour, though  :-)  In a game system where you are more-or-less
confined to a single city, it becomes quite easy (a week here, a week
there... pretty soon you\'ll be serving up Squishies of your own!

As for another idea from out little gaming group, try appointing one member
to keep a written chronicle of the events that happen during the campaign.
This works really well if you are using a bunch of mini-adventures linked
together with a grand scheme entwining them all.  What happened during
session#3 might have significant relevance during session #11 and this
gives the players a way of looking back and picking up these earlier pieces
of the puzzle.  Our last Shadowrun campaign lasted nearly two years of real
time and the chronicle is now over 1 Mb long!  The guy responsible for
writing it basically took notes during the gaming sessions and has begun
compiling them into an actual work of fiction!  Now that\'s how to remember
your campaign.

Couple of times.  The most memorable one actually happened to me, and to
the current day I don\'t know why.  The other PCs claimed that they weren\'t
*directly* responsible for my character\'s death but I\'ll let you decide
:-)

We were playing Call of Cthulhu and my character (the legendary Jimmy
Molson-- teenage photographer for the Daily Planetary) had been stricken
blind earlier in the gaming session.  Yours truly was in the bathroom (err,
taking care of business) when the PCs (consisting of Clark Ment, Lois Mane,
& Perry Mite) thought that it was in the best interest of the party for a
*blind* individual to take point while they decended the main staircase of
an old haunted house.  When I returned to the gaming table, it was to the
chorus of... "make the most important roll in your character\'s life!"
Naturally, I failed, and little Jimmy Molson proceeded to:

	a) become the target of spontaneous human combustion,
	    causing him to...
	b) trip & fall down the stairs, while...
	c) continuing to spontaneously combust, during which time...
	d) his ammunition begin to explode, which naturally...
	e) set off the dynamite and molotovs he was carrying, which...
	f) proceeded to scatter burning bits of him everywhere, which...
	g) started a major fire in the lobby, resulting in...
	h) the whole house burning to the ground!

Another gaming group told me a story of a player in their TW2000 campaign
that was a bit of a pain in the ass.  They decided to lock him away inside
the group\'s APC while the rest of them talked to the locals about trading
for some supplies.  Our character, locked away inside the APC, decided he
didn\'t *like* being locked up and proceeded to try and blast his way out
using an Armbrust (ie: disposable anti-tank weapon)....

Stop laughing.

> Have you ever done it yourself?  

I\'ve wanted to, but somebody else beat me to it!

> As a GM would you let it happen, and how would you handle the
> aftermath?  Divine retribution? <g>

Our players don\'t have a problem with character death, as long as it fits
into one or more of the following criteria:

	-it is the result of a player "just asking for it"
	-it benefits the plot (ie: it fits into the grand scheme of things)
	-all applicable rules are used to allow for survival
	-the death sequence is "glorious" (see Jimmy Molson above)
	-the referee isn\'t a sadist and has the trust if his/her players

For example, a character that roleplayed a trip to the corner store to buy
some milk and was killed by a guy running a red light (due to an encounter
table or other randomly determined event) would be a pointless waste of
both the character & the time that went into his/her creation.  OTOH, if
the driver of the car was hired by someone to kill the character and make
it look like an accident, and the PC was given all of the necessary chances
for survival as listed in the rules (perception, damage, etc.), I would
find nothing wrong with it.  Of course, the referee better have a *pretty
good* reason for it and allow the character\'s teammates some chance at
trying to figure out what happened (and possibly exact revenge).

The ongoing story is what is really important when running a campaign
designed with some sort of grand scheme linking the gaming sessions
together (and not just a bunch of adventures that have little bearing on
each other).  However, a player should NEVER feel that his/her character
isn\'t contributing, be it while the character is alive or in his/her death.
The only thing worse than a pointless death is a pointless life (ie: the
character fails or is prevented from participating in the plot of the
campaign).

Ah, this sounds like Call of Cthulhu.  According to our ref, it is not
uncommon to come across a line in a publisized adventure that states
something to the effect of "by this time, XX players should have been
killed off...".  It just so happens that in this particular campaign, only
one player *did* manage to survive to the end... and only because he played
in only half the gaming sessions.  Sigh.

Sure. When you are young you are such rubber people and the 
concept of mortality hasn\'t been fully grasped so this becomes apparent 
in the cartoon way characters in RPGs are played. I had players pull a 
few Black Spy vs White Spy type gags in the early years of playing. One 
sees the same kind of thing in the DOOM type computer games with the 
option to play deathmatch (a well used option I am sure).
These days though my players are very aware of their own mortality and 
plays their characters that way. They don\'t do things now that they 
would have before and don\'t carry petty disagreements from reality into 
the travellerspace. Travellerspace is a more rational place because of 
that and I feel sometimes that the game has lost something because of 
that (fun perhaps?).

> > Have you ever done it yourself?

Not consciously, though I still have players who believe to this day 
that I engineered circumstances deliberately or fudged dice roles 
against them. I turn I believe some players cheated with critical dice 
roles in my group in the past. It is funny how they can consciously 
teamcheat by sitting there watching a critical dice role then back up 
the person who returns a cheat call. Maybe I am just paranoid or maybe I 
 have been in enough teamcheat situations as a player to be suspicious.

	First of all refreeing Traveller tastes different than
	refreeing other RPGs.

	- In "Midgard" we have a group of heros travelling to the
	  lands slaying dragons, and they have a clear distinction
	  between good and evil. 
	- In "Deutschland in den Schatten" we have the "big city
	  fealing" high tech, low life. I realy enjoy that a campain
	  can be started and you have an other set of players every
	  session. I also like the events of calling a decker by
	  phone.
	- In Traceller we have the "we are all in the same boot"
	  fealing wich makes this game exiting.

	So how does my game taste ?

	I\'m preparing all npc characters on board, and try to find
	a place for the players by a first talk in the kitchen.

	Next I know an event line, every flight has some events, e.g.

	  - a noble passenger is going mad
	  - the ship is crossing a bunch of asteroids
	  - they get a message from star port that they
	    should wait for jumping because an important
	    mail has to be deliverd (together with the noble
	    who is coming on board, and there is no free
	    staterroom ;-)

	Now the came starts the players interact. The clock
	now has an important role, normaly I\'m asking "next
	day" every hour, while the players talk and I try to
	make my part refreeing the npcs. When an event occur
	I\'ll switch to real time, this is ok as I now can
	calculate in turns. Realtime and the uncertain of
	sensors makes an interesting thrill for the game !

> In my RC game, my style was "mission-oriented."

	I always travell in the wilds. I dislike the "you get
	order to ..." scenarios, I also thing that my group
	(Knigth Takeda *Daibei D* - piloting, astrogation,
	 Nadine Xerxes Gamma 17 - marketing, navigation,
	 computer, Howl *Vrag* - security, Galileo *fibre
	 optics* - astrogation, sensors and fire controll,
	 Nasti *standart* - technic) will fit well in a
	RC campain - I think they wont let they in.

	I more like the "you have trouble" scenarios so
	I\'ve tried to refree the Midu-Agasham fleet, with
	them, but they managed a spilt of the fleet before
	the first jump, because they decided to offer their
	trader to one of the empires, Nadine, Galileo, and
	Nasti moved to the Merc, while the rest of the playes
	moved to Mother. Nadine gave Kaneda a "kill him"
	chip written by Calilo some scenarios ago. Principal
	died, the group was questioned about their ship.
	They decidet to poker and told that they dont thing
	the fleet will make an additional jump as their
	AI\'s are now controlling the Merc and the Empire.

	They got rigth ;-)

	thats very common, i think that more characters died

	was a dispute in D&D where a priestres of Mamon asks

	I\'ve done it several times. Of course some characters

I did have this happen to me in both Space(d) Opera and AD&D.

In SO, it was a Rauwoof (canine) chasing the Mekpurr (feline) character
around with a grav platform.

In AD&D, a high-level mage and a high-level cleric had a long-running feud
(the two players hated each other). This conflict escalated until (to make
a long story short) the mage polymorphed into a pool of water and the
Cleric unknowingly killed him by casting purify water on him - he\'d had a
bad experience with a water wierd. ;)

Whoa! It\'s getting *deep* in here. <g>

I don\'t believe in reincarnation or karma.  I\'m monotheist and in the games

Hmmm... we generated characters once but we never got around to actually
playing it so I can\'t reply.  I can\'t really see any reason why somebody
would think that Ars Magica was more prone to the "PC revolving door"
syndrome than any other RPG, however.  Must have been the ref.

In Ars Magica, players control two PCs; one, a mage, and one, a mundane
(ie: non-magically inclined individual).  You were supposed to alternate
between the two characters depending on the mission the group undertook....

Well, I can\'t relate to what\'s going on in the UK, I can only relate 
to what\'s happening here.  Then again, GW hasn\'t opened shops here 
yet...  And from what I\'ve heard about them, I\'d firebomb them if 
they did... :-)

The local gaming convention which has been around for 6 years had a 
record number of attendees.

By comparison in 1980: 1 Game Store, 2-3 hobby shops that carried 
some gaming materials, but not as much...

Present:  7 Game Stores, no hobby shops..., several of the comic book 
shops here carried RPG stuff...including TNE...  I\'d say its about 
as healthy as it was 10 years ago, here.  Its not fair to compare it to the 
late 70\'s, early 80\'s at the height of the craze, but I feel its 
pretty healthy...

The games are stuck in specialty retailers for the most part, but 
these specialty retailers seem to be doing a good business...

<comments about UK gaming snipped>

I\'m sorry to hear the hobby is in such sorry shape over there...  I 
hope that things rebound at some point...

system is that it can be so deadly; one bullet to an unarmored head and you
could be wookie-meat, pal. Doesn\'t matter how long your character has been
around, how many skills you\'ve acquired, or how many decorations dot your
chest. Guns kill, and they don\'t discriminate. This is realistic. Unlike,
say, the time in my AD&D campaign when a theif failed a climbing roll and
fell 120" down a well, into 10" of water, taking 12 dice damage...and
*survived*. Ludicrous.

As for PCs killing each other: oh yeah. Again, in my AD&D game: a party
made the mistake of leaving a cleric behind in a dungeon room with a
Chaotic Evil assassin; the latter decided he\'d be appropriately Chaotic
and, well, Evil. Meeting up again with the rest of the party, he innocently
asked, "Where\'s the cleric?" "Wasn\'t he with you?" As they\'d been out of
the room, nobody suspected that he\'d killed the cleric, taken everything he
could carry, and hidden the body. 

Unsurprisingly, the guy playing the cleric was not amused. Fortunately, by
this point in the campaign, everybody belonged to one or another secret
society, many of them rivals (Heh heh. I\'d been reading a lot of Robert
Anton Wilson :). The cleric had recently been initiated into an
"inner-circle" cult within his Temple; they could bring valued members back
from the dead under certain circumstances. It was a priceless moment when,
weeks later, the cleric re-appeared amongst the party - just quietly took
his place beside the fire, claiming he\'d been "called away" by his Temple.
The assassin was completely spooked, sure the jig was up. But the cleric
followed instructions from his cult and didn\'t hold a grudge: he was an
Evil cleric, after all. He understood. And he now had a nice threat to hold
over the assassin\'s head: nobody else at that point in the game knew what
had really happened in the dungeon...

Heck, my old group (back in my home town, London, Ontario), actually
thrived on rivalry between PCs - though usually it was covert and sneaky.
Our PCs would literally carry out bloody feuds, rob each others houses,
desecrate Temples, put salt in the cement of another character\'s
fortifications... all clandestinely, rarely interfering with the group\'s
adventuring. One guy (hmm, the assassin, come to think of it) used a
*catapult* to throw bushels of rotting fish onto another PC\'s wedding! Just
as a gag, mind you. Then there was the Anti-Paladin who, through
disinformation and provocateurs, orchestrated a vicious war between the
Elves and Dwarves, pitting some PCs against each other. Nasty stuff, but
entirely within character.

PCs killing PCs in Traveller, though? Hmmmm... Oh yeah: I played in three
incredible convention games, involving a near-future scenario based on
Harlan Ellison\'s short story "Silent in Gehenna". In each game, three
separate groups of young radical insurgents would infiltrate a real
Canadian or American university campus on the same night, each group having
a different objective. The cool thing: the groups had no knowledge of each
other\'s plans, movements, or existence - they were revolutionary cells,
right? The main GM was in a corridor, connected by a *closed-circuit phone
system* to the three sub-GMs, each in a separate room with one of the PC
groups. You can\'t imagine the chaos... Group 1 leader says: "Okay, we\'re
dodging across the Quad to the ROTC building." Meanwhile, in the next room,
the sub-GM tells Group 2, "You see six armed men dodging across the quad,
towards your position." Of course Group 2 assumes these to be Security
troops, and opens fire...

God, but "Silence in Gehenna" was a scream. Somebody would be seizing the
campus radio station, while another party kidnapped the Rector, or tried to
rescue the captive student radicals from the Psychology Dept\'s dungeons.
"Suddenly, for no obvious reason, the ROTC building explodes." "As you
scuttle across the football field, the grass starts to scorch and flame
around you - pulse lasers on top of the dormitory towers." If you completed
your objective and escaped alive, it was a miracle. Since this was just a
convention scenario, and not part of an on-going campaign, the GMs made a
serious attempt to kill off every single PC before the end. By sheer luck I
survived two of these games, but finally bought it in the third. (The
Security team knew we were in the elevator, and we knew they were waiting
for us; "Ding"; the doors opened; everyone fired at once...)

Not that I favour hack-n-slash over real role-playing. Certainly not. It\'s
just that this thread is calling to mind some fond memories of...uh...
wonderful, mindless mayhem. <sigh>

My name\'s Glenn (as I\'ve already mentioned on X-boat) and I\'ve been away
from role-playing for over ten years; but I\'ve just been dragged back into
it by some improv-comedian friends who want me to run Traveller again. I\'ve
missed out on MT and TNE; but then again I always thought CT was a truly
great game system - I first played it in \'79 and began GMing in \'82 with
the Traveller Book.

Don\'t know if anyone\'s replied to my query on X-Boat, re: radio CETI in
Traveller, because I\'m subscribed to the digest; there hasn\'t been one in
over a week. What gives?

Thanks muchly to Rob Prior for saving my life (or a good portion of it)
with his Metator software - I was getting desperate at the prospect of
generating all the systems I\'ll need for my new (non-Imperium) milieu; was
actually considering using DOSware on a PC at work, or sullying my Mac with
SoftAT! <shudder>. Thanks also for answering all my dumb questions - I
guess I\'ll have to hunt down an old copy of MT now! (RE: bubble help: DOH!
I\'m always forgetting to try that.)

While I\'m at it: hello to fellow Montrealer Charles Collin; looks like you
work just a few blocks from where I live! (You gotta love a street named

A couple of questions:

1) Is there anywhere I can look to get a concise but useful history of
the (traveller) galaxy?  Does anyone have a web page with this on?
I am hoping to start a T4 Mileau 0 campaign soon but a bit of background
history (well I guess that\'ll be *future* :-) would be useful.

2) A question that has been bugging me - I dont know if this thread has
been covered before, if so can someone point me at the relavant digests.
How do you use money in a traveller campaign.  Does cash exist?  Does
everyone use credit cards? - if so do people walk around with personal
credit card readers?  Is there an imperial currency (i.e. credits?) or
does each planet have their own currency?  Are there both?  What about
exchange rates etc?

Thanks for any help,

Mike Harker asked:
>Do you have this data contained within a single .txt or .doc file ?

Sorry, no. I originally entered it onto the Amiga a few years ago, for use
with the _Hyperbook_ program. To get it to fit in memory, I created each
entry (page) as a new file. In fact, because the program did not have
scrolling text boxes, some long entries ended up being multiple pages... ie.
multiple files.

I copied the files from the Amy to the PC using _Diskmaster_ and the "ms1:"
drive substitution program. Next, I viewed a couple of pages using
_FileViewer_ and check out how _Hyperbook_ encoded its formatting commands.
These I substituted using a Word macro, which also adds all the nice HTML
headings and so on. Now I can just copy over a file, run the macro, and *hey
presto!* a new Library Data file!

If you want another source of data, ask Clay Bush or perhaps look at Peter
L. Berghold\'s site, where it is available as text files, one per letter of
the alphabet. When I originally loaded my Library Data, I got much of the
text from HIWG disks supplied by Clay. I combed through this text, comparing
it to the original sources (shown abbreviated in brackets at the bottom of
each page; no, I haven\'t created the Reference page yet!), adding sections,
correcting spelling, and so on. Each current entry should pretty much be
complete now!

The answer to this is covered quite nicely in T4.  Once you get the 
rulebook, you should have the answer to your questions. :)

As far as I know, no official decision has been made.  But my copy of T4 has
range bands given in 1.5m increments, not 2m, so I was making the assumption.

Personally, I\'m going to stick with 2m, but then I\'ll also be using my own
_very_ simplified varient of TNE combat rules (for those few times I run a
combat).  I was trying to figure out a way that the rest of you could use my
2m plans with a 1.5m range band system, and just reprinting the grid seemed
the easiest decision.

So, my deck plans will be done to 2m squares.  If enough demand warrants I
will reprint them with a 1.5m grid, by the simple expedient of changing the
grid size.  Anyone who doesn\'t like this is invited to draw their own plans
:-)

I have virtually finished the complex from the CT adventure "Shadows" (just
the lower level left, which my players never reached).  I did this one in
sections, so the referee could lay it out a room at a time - hereby
preserving the feel of exploration.   Is there any interest in seein these
plans?

Exactly.  I played in a D&D game where the referee did just that - threw lots
of nasties at us, then had a powerful NPC bail us out.  When it was his
miscalculation it was OK, but after a while we realized we were bulletproof,
and the game lost its interest.

How long has this player been playing?  I have 4 people involved in 
our game, only 1 of which has a whole lot of prior experience with 
Traveller in any form, and 1 who had no RPG experience at all... (The 
wife of 1 of the others)...  She tends to have the same problem...

I found 1 trick to almost forced her to get involved.  In our last game 
session, I turned a molehill into a mountain, and abducted 
about 2/3 of the party, forcing the other third to find out where 
they were...including the newbie.  She caught on real quick...  

Sometimes putting them in situations, where they\'re forced to become 
involved can help...as long as they don\'t seem completely 
contrived...

Frankly, I tend to introduce new players with 1 shot things, then 
move on to bigger and better...  I find that once they get used to 
the system a little bit, they think about the sort of character they 
really want to run, and I usually develop a feel for what sort of 
campaign would intrigue them most...

Also a bad generalization...  Sometimes its fun to place a squeaky

create a big right...and watch him/her squirm...

Definitely true...

Actually, I\'ve had several really enjoyable games in which the players abided
by the law, even the pesky local laws.  The physicist in the group (playing

finding loopholes for them to slip through.

Personally, I prefer games in which the players are the good guys.  Breaking
speeding limits, yes, murder and mayhem, no.

Chuck Maddox <cmaddox@xnet.com> asked why the Droyne are not noted as a

the scattered Droyne were, in fact, one race. This knowledge came later.

It\'s full of great adventure leads.

_Lee\'s Guide to Interstellar Adventure_ is another classic. In fact, the
hunting scenario lead into our Tavonni campaign...

Nice to have 76 adventures (x 3, minimum). Problem is, many of them put the
PC\'s on the wrong side of the law as an expected matter of course. I believe
that Marc himself made this complaint...

Now, depending on how your players view this, it may or may not be a
problem. However, if you have PC\'s attempting to be "squeaky clean" in order
to obtain a Letter of Marque, merc company licence, and bounty hunter
permit, they may view this as unproductive. ;-) With some tinkering (such as
putting the players on the side HUNTING the people that the original
storyline was for), it is still possible to use the majority of the scenarios.

As a referee, it was refreshing for me to watch a player attempt to accomplish 
his goals without stealing a starship, or breaking and entering.  Most of the 
time in my experience, players break laws for convienience sake, but rarely do 
I see any of the well executed plans that are so fun to watch in the movies.

In other words, the breaking of laws is for convieniece only -- to take a 
shortcut to reach a goal.  It\'s these kind of law-breakers that get caught 
(either by the authorities or by other bad guys).  Now what would really 
entertain me is to see some PCs design an elaborate scheme -- breaking laws or 
not.

Ecologist

For any number of players.
Required skills: Hunting/survival skills
Required equipment: none

Players=92 information:
While on a planet with indigenous life and a large population, the
players are approached by a short thin man wearing a safari vest. The
man identifies himself as a member of an ecological protection group.
He explains that pressures from the increasing population of the world
have severely damaged some habitats, threatening many of the less
adaptable species native to those habitats. The numbers of some
species have declined to the point where they are threatened with
extinction, the patron explains, and his group is attempting to set up
a captive breeding program for the \'spiny rat=92. He offers a reward of
Cr10,000 for each specimen that the players manage to collect
undamaged.

Referee=92s information
1. The situation is as presented above. The spiny rat is a small
squirrel like creature, covered in inch long spines. It moves
extremely quickly, and tracking and capturing the creature will be
difficult, perhaps requiring a local guide to assist the players.
Trying to catch one will be made more difficult by the creatures=92
metabolism, which renders tranquillisers ineffective. 

2. The situation is as presented above, however in this case, the
=91rat=92 is closer in size to a large dog, and is a formidable predator.
Tracking the creature down may be easier, but it will be far more
dangerous to capture and return to the ecologist. The players may
discover that the local name for the rat translates as =91sleep spine=92,
for the spines of this version of the =91rat=92 are capable of injecting a
powerful, perhaps fatal paralysing agent.

3. The creature is one of the two alternatives above,  but the
ecologist, while sincere in his intent, has not got permission from
the government to engage in a captive breeding program. Once the
creature has been recovered, the ecologist will offer the players a
further Cr10,000 for assistance in smuggling the animal off planet.

4. The =91ecologist=92 is actually a hunter trying to recruit assistance
in hunting down the animal, which has been discovered by a
pharmaceuticals megacorporation to contain a powerful concentrated
natural anagathic. The actual value of each specimen is closer to
Cr250,000. Furthermore, because the animal is endangered, the hunting
is strictly illegal.

5. The =91ecologist=92 is actually a smuggler, trying to obtain animals to
sell as pets on other worlds. This trade in the animals is the reason
for their rarity, rather than any major habitat disruption. The trade
is illegal, and the local law enforcement will not take kindly to the
players getting involved. A real ecologist might offer money to rescue
the animals.

6. The creature is protected by a law banning forestry in areas where
it is found. A logging operation owning an area of the =91rat=92 habitat
has been deliberately eliminating the rats so that it can continue
logging. The players may encounter the hunters of the rat while they
themselves are tracking it, or agents of the company might try to stop
the players returning with the specimen.

Businessman

For any number of players
Required skills:demolitions
Required equipment:none
Players=92 information:
A businessman approaches the characters while they are in a seedy area
of the spaceport. He explains that he is a representative of an
entertainment company which was once extremely successful on the
world, but has since been stifled by a larger firm, which has
developed a virtual monopoly through aggressive marketing. The
businessman offers the players Cr100,000 to destroy several warehouses
containing stockpiles of the company=92s games, the disruption in supply
allowing other companies back into the picture.

Referee=92s information
1. The situation is as presented above. The warehouses are on the edge
of town and have only a couple of night watchmen protecting them.

2. The warehouses are heavily guarded. A dozen security men with laser
pistols and light intensifiers patrol at night.

3. The warehouse is in the middle of a densely populated area, which
would make incendiaries and explosives likely to cause severe civilian
casualties. An alternative means to destroy the stock must be employed
(unless the players don=92t believe in bad karma), eg. water pipes used
to flood the warehouse, or EM pulses to damage electronic media,
depending on the world=92s TL.

4. The warehouses actually contain vital medical supplies, the
=91businessman=92 is an agent of an anti-government group. The players
once they find out may be left trying to leave quickly, or to
apprehend the agent.

5. The =91businessman=92 actually works for the monopoly, and is setting
the players up.  When captured they will incriminate a small but
growing rival company. Court damages to the monopoly would put the
rival out of business.

- ----
Government Official

Suitable for any number of players
Required skills: Scientific/research
Required equipment : none

Players=92 information
As the players are walking through a city the tree next to the bursts
spontaneously into flames, with no discernible cause. The fire
presents no great hazard, but this is just another example of the
weirdness of this town. The papers have been full of other
strangeness, fountains freezing, objects levitating, even a woman
appearing from nowhere in the middle of a shop, with no knowledge of
how she got there. The government contacts the players and offers a
reward of Cr35,000 for an explanation of the strange happenings.

Referee=92s information
1. A new city reservoir has recently opened in a forest some distance
from town. A small flower growing on the bank of the reservoir has
been releasing pollen into the water. This pollen acts as an extremely
powerful psionic drug. The strange happenings are a result of latent
psionics in the population being temporarily activated by the pollen.
People have no conscious control of these powers, and the pollen in
fact causes trained psionics to loose control of their power also.

2. A pro-psionic group has drugged the water supply in some small
areas with a chemical which has a similar affect to the pollen in 1.
above. They intend to demonstrate the psionic potential which is
present in a significant minority of the population in hopes of
increasing acceptance.

3. The strange happenings are hallucinations, induced by spores
released from a microscopic fungus which has begun to colonise the
city, having been unknowingly eradicated decades/centuries ago from
the city by the construction work involved in setting up the city,
which brought in raw materials which had not been contaminated with
the fungus.

4. A prankster equipped with an advanced holographic projector has
been creating the illusion of the strangeness which has been
occurring.

- ----
Mercenary commander

Suitable for any number of players
Skills required: medical
Equipment required: none

Players=92 information
While on a mercenary tour of duty the players notice an increasing
number of friendly troops have been hospitalised by a fever, which is
beginning to cause fatalities despite the medical care available. The
mercenary commander offers the players a Cr10,000 bonus to investigate
the cause of the illness, afraid that it will spread from the local
troops to the mercenary unit. The commander explains that he suspects
that the enemy has released some kind of biological weapon.

Referee=92s information
1. The situation is as presented above. The players will need to
infiltrate the enemy base. An antidote is available.

2. The enemy know nothing of the biological weapon. The weapon was in
reality released by the command of the friendly forces, hoping that by
appalling the civilian supporters of the enemy they could force the
enemy to cease their attack.

3. The enemy are also suffering from the same illness, which has been
released by a third faction, not involved in the fighting and just
wanting to end the conflict before it spills over into their
territory.

4. The troops fighting for the same side as the players are doing so
with some guilt, as the regime they are defending is both extremely
cruel and inept. The illness was produced by a staff doctor working
for the friendly forces, who was a research student before
conscription. It is contracted willingly by troops who don=92t want to
fight. The =91fatalities=92 are actually defections covered up by the
medical staff.

- ----
Chef

Suitable for any number of players
Skills required: Observation, steward, weapons
Equipment required: Light weaponry

Player=92s information:
The players are offered work as bodyguards protecting a celebrity chef
at a major cooking competition. The competition attracts competitors
from worlds all along the main, the final contest being held in the
starport at the subsector capital. The tables and kitchens are a riot
of colour and scent, but the players may quickly find out that it is
better not to know what is in some of the food. The players are
offered Cr10,000 for the work

1. As the first judge tastes the food prepared by the patron he cries
out in pain, falling over unconscious in front of a crowd of suddenly
silent onlookers before being rushed to hospital where he remains ill
for several days. The food has been poisoned by a rival chef.  The
players need to clear the chef of any blame.

2. As in 1. above, but the chef, although claiming that he has been
framed, is actually an assassin sent to kill a government figure who
was one of the judges. His victim dies in hospital shortly afterwards
unless the players manage to unravel the assassin=92s cover and find the
antitoxin extremely quickly.

3. As in 1 above, but the actual cause of the illness was an allergy.
Accusations and counter accusations will still be made.

4. An incompatibility in body chemistry leads to the judge becoming
psychotic when he tastes the food. This situation can be made more
interesting with an Aslan judge and a ban on weapons in the contest
hall.

5. The freighter carrying the ingredients required by the chef fails
to arrive. The chef gives the players responsibility for tracking down
the ingredients, or convincing substitutes with only hours before the
contest.

6. The chef falls ill before the contest. As the competition is a
matter of great planetary pride for his people he gives the players
his recipe book and tells them that the player with most steward
experience must compete in his place. 

- ----
Journalist

For any number of players
Skills required: none
Equipment required: image recorder

The players are approached by a journalist working for one of the
major news publications on the planet. He offers Cr30,000 for pictures
of a particular sports celebrity on holiday. The celebrity is on
holiday on the moon of the mainworld.

1. The situation is as presented above. The players may get chased by
hotel security, who will attempt to get the camera, but this should
not degenerate into a seriously dangerous situation.

2. Contrary to his public image, the celebrity is actually vicious and
paranoid. He will have personal security guards who are likely to be
extremely brutal in protecting his privacy.

3. The hotel complex is very close to a restricted military
installation. The =91journalist=92 is actually an intelligence agent who
is more interested in images of this installation which are captured
in the background of the photos. Military guards may notice the
players and get involved.

4. As in 1., 2. or 3. above, but the players are being used as a
diversion, while the real photographers take the photos. This will
increase the chance of encountering guards as the true photographers
will tip off security.

I reserve rights on this, but if people want to use this 
on their web pages, then sure, go ahead. In a couple of weeks I\'ll 
probably get round to putting up pages of my own which will 
have this and a lot of other adventure material.

Just make sure that the \'acting skill\' of the people involved doesn\'t play
a big part in determining their chances for success (or failure)...
otherwise, I\'d hate to role-play with the likes of Marlin Brando or Robert

right here is the name Marc Miller.  And DGP is nowhere to be found.

I\'m glad Marc is back, and I\'m pleased with pretty much everything I\'ve seen 
thus far (excepting Range Bands and a poor Aslan picture).  However, I have a 
VERY uncomfortable feeling about this.  This is NOT support for previous 
versions of Traveller.  A cynic would describe this as a specific effort to 
force people to discard a wealth of _GDW_ created background and buy a NEW 
Atlas of the Imperium (with a $15-$20 pricetag).    Invalidating the 
DGP-generated sectors makes sense to me, but arbitrarily moving around actual 
stars does not.

As for Canon - I honestly don\'t give a rat\'s ass about it.  I do care about the 
sizable investment in OFFICIAL GDW TRAVELLER MATERIAL that I have, which I 
would prefer not be lightly brushed aside.  Invalidating background material 
from second-source publishers like DGP might be slightly annoying, but overall 
is not a bad thing.  A new system for vehicles and starships is not a bad 
thing.  A new character generation system (very reminiscent of a previous one, 
in fact) is also not a bad thing.  Rewriting the historical premises would be a 
bad thing, and Marc Miller & Co have very carefully not done that.  However, 
just tossing out the stuff that was done by GDW under Marc Miller\'s masthead 
and direction is a BAD THING.  It is just opening the door to the same sort of 
frustrations that forced the TML to split into two lists.

Now, before I am accused of being "Joe Inflexible," I want to remind everyone 
that I was around here when TNE came out, and I was one of the ones that LIKED 
it.  While GDW had changed several key premises, I felt they had taken a game I 
loved (CT) and added some very real improvements to it.  They did not just 
randomly change important historical contexts like the name of the Emperor in 
1101 or the Imperial symbol or THE LOCATIONS OF STARS.  I am very flexible when 
it comes to changes in game mechanics, and I\'m very happy with tthe potential 
of some of these cool new Mileus.  I just feel that this particular issue is 
not an attempt to fix something, but an attempt to sell something.  I\'m more 
than willing to pour plenty of consumer dollars into the Imperium Games coffer, 
but I want to do that by buying NEW material, not a needless rework of 
something that was just fine as it was.  We\'re not talking about statistical 
goofiness in UPPs here; we talking about a map showing WHERE THE STARS ARE.

Yes, I realize I can use the old maps.  Hell, I can even make up my own maps.  
This is fine, but the problem is that it should not be necessary.  To 
paraphrase a movie I once saw, "Are you saying stars migrate?"

2) A question that has been bugging me - I dont know if this thread has
been covered before, if so can someone point me at the relavant digests.
How do you use money in a traveller campaign.  Does cash exist?  Does
everyone use credit cards? - if so do people walk around with personal
credit card readers?  Is there an imperial currency (i.e. credits?) or
does each planet have their own currency?  Are there both?  What about
exchange rates etc?

Joe responded

The answer to this is covered quite nicely in T4.  Once you get the=20
rulebook, you should have the answer to your questions.

Mark continues

I don\'t think the subject is covered "quite nicely in T4."
T4 offers a better examination of the subject than other versions of =
Traveller, true, but I do not think that any "canon" exists for money in =
Traveller.

Every campaign I have participated in or ran has handled that symbolic =
store of value called money differently. Each region of space, world and =
sometimes subplanetary government handles these things differently in my =
current campaign.

Pete (or others) if you want to discuss specific possibilities I\'m game.

Hi, all!

A week or two back, I posted a question asking about posting deckplans
for ships previously published by GDW on the web.  Someone (sorry, I
forget who :-/ ) very sensibly suggested that I contact IG.  I emailed
IG and got a response from MM, which I post here with his permission.

If you use a deck plan (scanned from a book or whatever), you should
acknowledge the source of the plan, the copyright, and the trademark,
something like this:

Type S Scout originally appeared in Traders & Gunboats, GDW, 198X. Some of
the materials on this page are copyright 198X-1996 Far Future Enterprises.
Traveller is a registered trademark of Far Future Enterprises.

The purpose is to protect the property (so no one can later come back and say
that FFE acknowledged it was in the public domain because we did not pursue
those who didn\'t acknowledge the copyright, trademark, etc).

I would think that putting a deck plan in a web page comes under "Fair Use."
As opposed to selling things, or copying rules verbatim and handing them out
free.

No, Ken, thank you for keeping us up to date and answering as many questions
as you are able.  We (Traveller Fans) are not known for our leniency towards
those who produce the game, but so far I think you guys have done a
Mahvelous Job.

Thanks for "Keeping the Flame!"

When I first got out of college, the first job I got was as a night manager
a BK Resteraunt.  I ran one of the TNE main book campaign\'s (Gerrard) after
work with some of my crew and one of the other managers.  This setting was
actually ideal, because I was able to sit in a booth with all my books and
papers scattered aroung me and everyone else was at tables too far away to
see.  :)

Nice bit of planning, and far more elegant than the standard Vietnam-era American 
approach to the problem: rolling a frag grenade into the officer\'s bedroom. They called 
it "fragging."

I congradulate the party\'s elegance on dealing with this guy.

One campaign had two players whose friendship had degenerated over time
into serious anger.  There were others involve, almost all of whom were
also players. 

It became a contest to see how long I could *keep* them from killing each
other off.  Finally one of the characters (who had missed a few sanity
rolls previously) walked into the missile magazine with a FGMP and let
loose.

At least they both went. 

Of course, they were right at each other when we started a D&D campaign a
week later.
  

Never let players who hate each other play in the same game, especially if
that hatred is smouldering just under expressed levels.

  Tons-o-fun doing this with my group!  We got a couple of kenpoists, a SCA

military brats with reasonable firearm experince.

And the clock is ticking \'way
The Ithklur fight and the Hivers might
If they\'re far enough away

I think we had this character in the TML PBeM, years ago... as I recall,
  he was put out of OUR misery early on when his player went inactive.
  That wouldn\'t have been you, Steve?

Then there\'s the filk I came up with shortly after TNE came out:

"Deyo!  Deyyyyo...
 Virus come and it wrecka my home
 Deyo!  Deyyyyo...
 Virus come and it wrecka my home.

 Lucan an Strephon and Dulinor, ho!
 Virus come and it wrecka my home
 Civil war \'cross the Imperium, ho!
 Virus come and it wrecka my home.

 Hey, Mister Hiver mon,
 Tell me what to do now
 Virus come and it wrecka my home
 ..."

 and so on.

Another idea I\'ve had recently, though not exactly a filk, is a
  video montage of the Rebellion set to "Land of Confusion" by
  Phil Collins/Genesis:

"I must have dreamed a thousand dreams
 Been haunted by a million screams
 But I can hear the marching feet
 They\'re moving into the street

 Now did you hear the news today?
 They say the danger\'s gone away
 But I can see the fires still alight
 They\'re burnin\' into the night..."

Here\'s my thought on this one:

The Scout is "free" because the ship remains the property of the 
Imperium, and the ship as well as the character can be called back into 
service when needed.  This is "canon."

The Free Trader isn\'t free, because the character actually owns the ship 
(well, he owns the mortgage anyway[G]).  

So, the other two should be like the Free Trader, as I assume they are 
owned by the characters who receive them.

are not rewarded for long service and even the Traveller Aid Society has
forsaken them.  That is unless I\'m missing something, wouldn\'t be the first
time :-)   I\'m not too sure that an extra skill a term is balanced by no
pension.  Does anyone know the historical background and or reasoning for
not giving the IISS retirees a pension?
Also troubling is fact that a scout cannot be rewarded a TAS membership.
The premiss is that the TAS awards membership based upon heroism or
extraordinary service. You would think that heroism or extraordinary service
difines the Scout Service and the TAS would want people experienced in
exploration and survey.  Any thought on this subject?

Substitute the T4 rules for Spectacular Success for the BL rules on
Outstanding Success. Spectacular Failures have no effect.

You still need to use the d10 and d20 for damage rolls and the like.
(if anyone has a suggestion on how to alter these to 2 or 3d6 rolls, please

Mark my good fellow, instead of walking into a church, imagine yourself walking into a 
shipyard - 1100 years ago.  Don\'t expect the ship designs from Year 0 to look the same 
as ships in 1104.  For that matter, I wouldn\'t expect the ships from Diaspora to 
look toooo much like ships from the Spinward Marches.  Unless, of course, they come 
from the same manufacturer....

Aaaahh, for the Glory Years....  
I too prefer the early 1100\'s for my campaigns.  It\'s the era my players and I grew up 
with.  But, as a "historian" I have to admit I am intrigued by the year 0 setting.  
With luck, the friendly game gurus of IG won\'t leave the 1100s crowd out in the cold.
Hmmm, maybe it\'s time to sharpen my pencil and write that between the wars (4th 
and 5th Frontier, that is) campaign guide.

<Rant Mode ON>

Consider that canon, and players inflexibility about the same to some 
extent, helped KILL Traveller the first go around with GDW...

Think about it...

There were inconsistencies galore when only CT was around.  Judges 
Guild produced 4 sectors, that were IMHO, good (if not great) 
products.  Judges Guild goes belly up, and sometime later, GDW 
decides to invalidate the old sectors, but even uses 3 of the same 
sector names...  They replace them with maps in Atlas of the 
Imperium...

What led to this decision?  Maybe Loren or Marc can enlighten me (and 
I guess I need enlightening).  GDW never redid the sectors, beyond 
the sparse maps in Atlas of the Imperium...  Ditto Paranoia Press\' 
Vanguard Reaches & The Beyond...  So even in CT days, we have 
inconsistencies in 6 sectors of known space, and DGP hasn\'t even 
entered the picture yet...  I won\'t even talk about the 
inconsistencies created by various world writeups in JTAS & 
Challenge, which are well documented...  Not to mention that at least 
1 minor alien race has been transplanted an entire sector by GDW since 
it was 1st written up...

Then comes DGP.  They generate all those nifty sectors that now sit 
in GEnie\'s archives, as well as numerous ftp sites.  But in many 
cases, they had errors, in even more cases, they conflicted with 
Atlas of the Imperium...  (I\'ve been slowly plugging them into Jim 
V\'s Gal2.1 program, so I know what I\'m talking about here)...  

Then GDW takes back total control of their game.  1 of their last acts of MT, 
before scrapping it for TNE, is to generate a sector booklet for the 
Diaspora sector set in the Hard Times era...ironically enough, the 
source data for the pre-Hard Times era numbers is...you guessed it, 
the DGP sector data...

TNE based its Collapse/TNE era data for both the RC and Regency stuff 
on the DGP stuff as well so...DGP\'s supporting a whole lot of the 
foundation...  I\'m not so sure you can chuck DGP...any easier than you can 
chuck GDW\'s stuff...especially since this leaves you with: Spinward 
Marches, Solomani Rim, Diaspora, Gvurrdon Sector, Massilia, and a 
tiny bit of Old Expanses...  

If you really want to nitpick, Massilia, written by DGP staff for GDW\'s 
Knightfall, as well as Diaspora (based on DGP\'s stats) should probably be 
chucked as well, which kills the RC setting from TNE, which kills 
everything including the Regency sourcebook from TNE which was based 
on DGP\'s Domain of Deneb sector data printed in the MTJ to...Shall I 
continue...

Then on top of all this, there\'s all the stuff out there from 3rd 
party licensees...Group 1, Seeker, FASA, Sword of the Knight\'s more 
recent stuff...

What am I saying here?  I guess what I\'m saying is what does it 
matter...  Recent astronomical discoveries suggest that Traveller got 
it wrong when they mapped a lot of known space, so the biggest CANON 
of all, REALITY, doesn\'t fit the CANON that we all know, cherish, and 
border on zealotry about at times...

I\'m going to be disappointed if a lot of my players walk into the Spinward 
Marches, shortly after year 0, and its the same Spinward Marches of 1100 
years later...  Yes, the population government, and tech level won\'t be the 
same, but beyond that, the sector\'s been done to death.  About all you\'d have 
to do is take all those world maps and writeups from GDW\'s stuff, remove 
the demarcations for cities, delete the references to the people, and you have 
the same tired sector that I\'ve run WAY TOO MANY people through campaigns 
in for years...  Year Zero is about 1st contacts...exploring new and alien 
worlds, recontacting and rediscovering lost cultures...not about 
exploring the same tired systems with a few less colonists...  I say 
keep canon where convenient and absolutely necessary, but I refuse to 
have a meltdown because stuff doesn\'t match a lot of previous 
offerings...as a matter of fact, I\'ll be happier if it doesn\'t to 
some extent.  

And just how much do we know about Core sector, 
anyways...  1 set of articles in a TD (IIRC, I never had it), a few 
thin references from TNS articles in Challenge, mainly from the 
Rebellion era, a set of mediocre UWP for the sector on an FTP site 
from a company that hasn\'t published materials of ANY kind for 
Traveller for 4 years, the UWP for Core(Sylea) itself...(and there 
are previous inconsistencies in the UWP from GDW\'s era as well)  Heck, for 
those of us who don\'t have the particular TD (which is undoubtedly, 
the majority) it was written up in, we have more information on the 
1 page in the T4 rulebook, than in all previous sources combined...

Bottom line:  
As with any RPG, there is a trade off between fan-created, and 
published material...  Use too much fan-created material, and you\'re 
going to wind up not being able to use published material verbatim in 
your campaigns.  Use only published material, and frankly, you lose 
at least some of the fun of the game for a GM, which is designing a 
world that works down to the last rock and ice cap, and having the 
fun of watching players try to figure it out...  As usual, we\'re 
going to have to decide how much we use, and how much we toss...

And for those of us hung up on CANON...who can\'t fathom the HORROR of 
not being consistent with the previously published universe, believe it or not, 
you\'re probably already doing that...  I doubt there are a dozen people on this 
list that owns every word written about the game.  Remember, that includes all 
those 3rd party licensees (even the ones that lasted shorter than a baseball 
season), all those quaint articles, adventures and world writeups in 
places like The Space Gamer, Dragon, and others.  All 24 of those 
JTAS\'s, all 53 Challenge\'s...all the articles from the indies...et 
al...

Then there are the contradictions...  There is a list of some 50+ 
worlds that moved over the years on 1 of the ftp sites...  Whole alien 
races have been forcibly transplanted some 30-40 parsecs for the sake of 
canon...  GDW actually snuffed a bunch of minor races in Glimmerdrift 
Reaches out of existence when they invalidated the old Judges Guild 
stuff...  I\'m surprised the Imperial Ministry of Justice didn\'t bring up 
Wiseman, Chadwick, Miller, et al, up on charges of genocide... :-)

You use what you have or create your own, because you don\'t have all 
this...which means you\'re not following the...egad, CANON...because 
you had to, heaven forbid, improvise or create.  If you view the previously 
published material as a bible, then imagine the Bible, if you tore out a few of the 
Psalms, a couple of the Prophets, maybe that whole Jonah & the Whale thingy, 
and tried to pass it off as the Bible...then imagine if 1 of the 
books of the prophets told you that all of the previous stuff in the 
old testament was wrong...GRR!

I could care less whether the DGP stuff is matched 100%.  Heck, they 
can take a few liberties with the old GDW stuff if they want (and you 
could probably make a case for this with Solomani Rim in light of 
more recent astronomical discoveries)...  Give me ideas.  Give me stuff I can use.  
Give me broad historical backdrops...  I\'d prefer to fill in the details myself...

And take those old hangups about CANON, stuff \'em in a CANNON with a 
powder charge, and pull the lanyard...  You\'ll feel a lot better...

    'body' => 'Hello Fellow Travellers,
  I was discussing some stuff with a few of my players - regarding the
setting up of a colony, and setting the law levels and social levels and
all of that fun stuff <grin>.  What I am currently using is World Tamers
Handbook in the hopes that it can provide a lot of information on how to
set up colonies, and how to run them.  As it turns out, it opens a whole
pandora\'s box of questions as wells as answering a few questions (yeah,
you have been there right?!!!).
  WTH gives the basics about how to start a colony, as well as assigning a
rough tonnage required to ship any of the "capital investments".  It also
inplies that a certain amount of what the colony produces must be shipped
out - if only to get the credit required for importing luxeries and other
well needed equipment...

  So here is the mainthrust question I have for you people on this list...

In Striker, they give a formula for calculating the Gross Planetary
Output.  They then state that a set percentage is required to be set aside
for military spending and such.  Likewise, in Trillion Credit Squadron,
they state that a set amount of money is available per
planet/subsector/sector based upon the population ratings, the civilian
government rating, and whether the planet/subsector/sector is at war or
peace.
  Now what I am getting at is a logical extension of all that information,
and am trying to determine what kind of tonnage is required to keep the
trade routes flowing.  While the random charts for passengers and cargo
and freight is fine with regards to the general day to day affairs of
tramp freighters, it isn\'t ok when attempting to do a simulation of the
Empire\'s trade.
  You might wonder to yourself "why bother with all that work" and you
would probably be right.  But attention to details such as what I am
proposing might make the Imperium seem a little more alive and rational.
For instance: suppose you have an agricultural world at tech 9.  It is a
veritable garden world and is literally capable of being the breadbasket
of the sector.  As part of that subsector, are two vacuum worlds, a
overpopulated world, as well as some marginal worlds.  Suddenly, food has
a lot more value than what the "trade formulas" would indicate.  In fact,
it leads into something which the Classic Traveller never really went into
with regards to character background generation (ie High Guard).  What
reasons are there for characters to have backgrounds in raids, police
actions, and so forth?  What planets are the targets of such raids?  Where
were the wars that took place for players to earn their purple hearts,
MCUF, and the whole plethora of other medals awarded during wartime
actions?  If we examine the scenario I mentioned above, with all those
worlds short on food, and the one world with food, how long will it be
before the game of politics rears it\'s ugly head and plays games with the
policies of the other worlds?
  Another thing to occurs to me to wonder about... What is the overall
government rating of the imperium?  What are the limitations that the
Imperium places upon worlds, and citizens of the Imperium?  In short, I
would like to see more of the big picture before starting to work on the
small picture...

  Besides, in order to have unbridled ambition for your NPC\'s and PC\'s,
there has to be something for them to aspire towards - something bigger
than what they have now...

I hadn\'t thought of that.  But it is true.

Still, each person has a point at which she feels that a product with the 
"Traveller" name on it is, in fact, no longer "Traveller."  If IG bought 
the rights to Universe, and just did a search-and-replace of the word 
"Universe" with "Traveller," would that be "Traveller?"  Not to me.

But that\'s an easy one.  

It becomes more difficult when you talk about a product like MT, TNE, or 
T4.  They\'re all recognizably Traveller to one degree or another, when 
looked at objectively.  But subjectively, I\'ll bet each one of those 
sacrifices one or more elements of "canon" which makes it become 
something other than Traveller to at least one person on this very list.

Reasonably, we should all look at this objectively.  First of all, 
whenever you buy ANY game, you are buying a set of guidelines.  These 
guidelines include rules and setting.  Both can be changed by individual 
GMs to suit their style and tastes.  Example 1:  When we bought 
Shadowrun, my gaming group immediately disliked the amount of money a 
character got for taking the highest level of wealth in character 
generation.  So, we halved the amounts on the table.  Example 2:  We 
didn\'t like the "official" setting of Gamma World, so we modified the 
h*ll out of it, changing the maps, the technology available, the beings 
in existance, and a whole slew of other things.

These sorts of things can be done with Traveller as well.  You can use 
stuff from previous editions.  You can use your own stuff.  You can use 
IG\'s new stuff.  You can mix-and-match to your heart\'s content.

However, I\'m a purist in the sense that I dislike mixing game systems.  I 
will not be using CT-era stuff with T4, no matter how much I happen to 
dislike any aspect of the T4 game.  Weird, huh?  Further, I feel no 
qualms about putting home-grown rules into T4.  Kind of a dichotomy, but 
that\'s just how I am.

So, I can relate to those who want T4 to be a reincarnation (to one 
degree or another) of their favorite Traveller system.  However, it seems 
clear that there ARE ways to make T4 into whatever system one wants it to 
be.

Personally, I would be happiest if all the maps change - for all eras.  
I\'ve "done" CT\'s Spinward Marches and Solomani Rim /way/ too much to want 
a simple rehash.  Move some stuff around.  Change the governmental 
structures.  Change the X-boat routes.  In short, keep the "frontier" 
feel the Spinward Marches are supposed to have, but change just about 
anything else.  That will make the Marches fun in 1100 again.

\'Course the folks who want nothing to be changed might say "Well, if that 
is what you want, follow your own advice and make it yourself.  Leave the 
official material alone!"

That is true, except for the fact that when I buy a product from IG, I 
expect it to be NEW product.  If it is simply a repackaged CT-era 
product, I\'ll be mighty disappointed.  I already have all that stuff.  
Give me something NEW.

Yes!  That is what I want as well.  Keep it the same in a broad sense,

You want to know how to get lots of floor plans for buildings.  When a

gaps. These may be covered in MT or TNE, but I never read either of those.

According to T4, page 58: Under normal gravity, a character can leap up, or
standing broad jump, a distance of: (Strength+Athletics) x 10cm. (Actually
the authors don\'t include brackets, which makes this a bit unclear, but I
assume this is the correct formula). Also, under 1G, a character can do a
running broad jump of (Str + Ath) x 0.5 meters. 

The text claims that jumping in variant gravities is "defined in Chapter
11: World Generation" - which is actually Chapter 12, where in fact it
isn\'t covered. So here\'s my stab at it:

House Rule:
Leaping/Jumping in Variant Gravities:
Simply divide the normal distance by the G rating of the planet.

Example: a PC with Str. of 9 and Athletics-1 can leap up, or standing-jump,
a distance of 1m under 1G, or 2m under 0.5G, 10m under 0.1G, 100m under
0.01G(!),  only 50cm under 2G, and so on. Technically, one could jump
farther under some circumstances, but this would require a task roll,
usually involving Combat Environment skill or similar. Under 3G, jumping
any distance over a 30cm becomes an Athletics test.

The same PC can do a running jump of 5m under 1G, 50m under 0.1G, 25m under
0.5, 2.5m under 2G, and 1.75m under 3G. Any such jump is going to require a
task roll against an applicable skill.

- --
I defy anyone to remain standing when a grenade goes off two meters away,
or they get hit by a Magnum bullet. Therefore...

House Rule:
Stopping Power:
A hit from any weapon (except lasers) rated at 4D damage (before armor
subtractions) automatically knocks a character prone. When hit by weapons
rated at 2D-3D damage, a PC must roll vs. Dexterity to remain standing. 1D
weapons: only roll vs. Dex if the PC is very fatigued, wounded, or drunk.

Getting knocked down when hit might incur a further point of damage, at the
referee\'s discretion. If a character is braced in some way, against a wall
or doorframe, they might get a DM+4 on their roll to remain standing; and a
4D hit might not automatically blow them over.

This rule gets interesting when the PCs or NPCs are on a rooftop, balcony,
staircase, etc. Yiii!

Two other, more serious, gaps I\'ve noticed in T4: there\'s no Armor table,
and no Tech Level table. So of course I\'ve written my own. But it\'s time
consuming, covering over the holes in the system. I\'m having fun, all the
same...

He used to be a member of the Traveller Mailing List once upon a time,

w/ Frank Chadwick regarding GDW\'s copyright policy. I\'m sort of
poking around in my personal archives, trying to find out exactly
what was said, so as to possibly include the material in a small
compilation covering the history of GDW\'s/IG\'s/FFE\'s copyright policy.
If anybody knows Scott\'s email address and/or miraculously still has

Although this compilation is still in a half-baked state, I have managed
to collect together a number of interesting articles, and in reviewing
this old material, I have to admit that I\'m somewhat gratified that
Marc Miller seems to be much more net-friendly than GDW ever was. If

The difference between the two forms of attacks is that of kinetic versus
stored energy.  THe grenade\'s explosion is the chemical release of energy,
and is disproportionate to the energy required to loft the grenade.
Standing next to the shockwave would in most likelyhood, knock you down
(to put it mildly).  On the other hand, Newton\'s law "for every action,
there is an equal and opposite reaction" is the governing law with regards
to bullets.  If the bullet leaving the gun does not "knock" down the
person firing the gun, then it should not be automatically knocking down
the target - assuming that the target and the firing person are of
approximately similar masses.  Therefor, remove the automatic rule of the
4d6, and change it to a difficulty task versus Dex based upon the
impacting damage - that I might go along with.  What knocks a person down
per se is the off-balance nature that comes of trying to balance upon two
points (ie feet) when gravity is doing it\'s level best to bring you down
to the ground AND the unexpected impact of a weapon.  This of course does
nothing to explain how the body reacts to sudden injury.  There are too
many instances where wounded men were totally unaware they were wounded!

Right after TCS came out, some friends and I did some (very crude) work on
shipping.  The idea was that player empires could boost their military
budget by licensing privateers, with the added bonus of hurting the
opponents budget for the next year.  Basically, each planet had to have X
cargo tons transit through it\'s starports to support its GNP, which made
for some interesting situations at some neutral worlds - a couple of times,
several empires had treaties regulating the amount of their naval tonnage
they\'d allow at a world (generally about 200Ktons per empire "to protect
neutral shipping interests" of course), without consulting the world.

We also came up with some rules for having the navy run black programs and
have them generate TL increase.  We had split up TL into many different
areas (J-Drive, M-Drive, Powerplants, Med, etc etc) and had a rule of not
allowing more than a 3 TL spread for a world.

My idea was to run a couple of centuries of TCS to generate the history of
my campaign universe, and then run some pcs through the "interesting"
years.  This worked out rather well.

Alas, my notes for this campaign were lost (along with all my CT stuff) in
Hurricane Andrew a few years back, so I can\'t really be more specific.

There were a couple of interesting historical events like the fortification
of Clarke\'s Moon - A major (more than 40% of the empire\'s total naval
tonnage) naval task force jumped in with several million tons of cargo
ships, used the task force\'s spinal meson guns to excavate 30 thousand
craters suitable for the prefab units (100 Ton meson bay, powerplant,
computer, fiber optic links to neighboring bunkers) they\'d brought along in
the supply train.  Dropped the units with specially designed combat
engineer ships, and buried them.  Then they spent several months using the
moon (sole moon of the one gas giant in the crucially located asteroid
belt) as target practice with the intention of "making it smooth as a
$%#$%! billiard ball" so that the enemy couldn\'t be sure where the meson
guns were buried.  It cost him several years budget, but it cut the other
empire in half since it was the only J-2 connection between the two
subsectors.

Then there was the guy who decided to build half-million ton dispersed
structure carriers that carried 5,000 Flea-class fighters.  The carrier
groups also had several 200Kton tenders that provided extra maintenance
facilities.  A battle group with a couple of these would jump into a system
and pretty effectively bar it from enemy activity.  The expression on the
guy who first got hit was priceless when Mark said "I launch 5,000
fighters. <pause for comprehension>  And what the hell, the Boyington will
launch 5K fighters as well.  I believe you were bragging about the 800
fighters in your screen?"

On falling rocks - all the PCs thought of them, seperately, built them, and
then  came to seperate agreements not to use them (typically, they\'d get
into a treaty negotiation and whip out the big stick, only to have it
countered, panic and agree not to use them against each other) or even to
mutually disarm.  Unsurprisingly, they always held back a couple or three
"just in case."

Well Aslan girls are mean,
I really dig that fur they wear;
And the Vargr girls, with the way they shoot,
They chased me out when I went there,
Vilani nobles\' daughters have a lot of things to steal,
And Zhodani girls, it\'s a funny thing, they seem to know just how I feel.

  I wish they all could be Solomani girls...

The Rim is hot on fashion,
Everybody\'s dressed to kill
And if you say the wrong thing in the wrong startown bar
You can be damn sure they will.
The Virus trashed my favorite worlds,
And there\'s not a lot to save,
So I\'m gonna stick with my Terran chick
And we\'ll surf the Empress Wave!

Well, I\'m not sure, but I think I may have pissed off a bunch of people
with my little complaint about the Core subsector in T4.  

Let me first say that I do agree with those who say "Well, you don\'t have
to follow canon, so what are you worried about?".  I\'m not a big stickler
for "official" background stuff generally.

But now here\'s my problem:  I\'m trying to come up with a background set in
Year 0.  I would like it to fit as much as possible with the stuff that IG
has/is/will be published (I know I don\'t _have_ to, but I _want_ to,
okay?). So I want to fit the Core subsector as published into my version
of the nascent 3rd Imperium. 

According to the information I have from the Imperial Encylcopedia, Sylea
controlled an entire sector in Year 0.  This sector presumably included
the Core subsector and about 15 other subsectors around it.  Furthermore,
by Year 0 they had controlled this area of space for at least several
decades if not several centuries.  Now all of a sudden there\'s the T4 Core
subsector whose rimward half is unexplored.  In fact it is stated on the
map that these worlds with no UPPs listed have not been contacted in
centuries.

So my question is:  If this is the Core subsector from Year 0, why have
the Syleans (apparently) only expanded coreward? Why have they not even
sent basic scouting missions to the rest of the systems in their vicinity
when they\'ve expanded several subsectors in every other direction?  Should
I modify the background I\'m designing to fit this subsector in?  Or will
it turn out to be the Core subsector from -500 Imperial?  If that\'s the
case, then I\'ve wasted some effort if I try to shoehorn it into my
background. If it turns out to be the core subsector from Year 0, then I
need some explanation as to it\'s layout which seems to violate either
Traveller\'s history or common sense. 

Any help on this issue would be appreciated,
Charles.

No, but do you realize that bar hopping is probably the one common thread that 
liks ALL role-playing games together?  I\'ve played with guys who wouldn\'t be 
caught dead in a real bar, but their characters go into bars every time they 
leave their ship.  Of course, depending on the genre, they will go into a 
drinking establishment whenever they get into town.

I thought I would make a random bar encounter table since PCs spend so much 
time there, we might as well streamline that part of the adventure.

Your description of playing out an adventure in a \'real world location\'
with multiple groups (Silent in Gehenna) struck a great cord with me.

When I was younger we played Trav regularly.  We had a great on going
camapign and that was brilliant.  However, someone got it into their
head to run a sort of Gladatorial Arena in an AD&D game we played and
the idea really appealed to the guys playing Trav.  Now we all lived
around a school which we used as a huge playground.  We played all sorts
of games there and knew the place really well - when we were younger we
even used to go climbing all over the roof of the buildings - so we knew
every inch of the school.  Also, right adjacent to the school was a
large park with lakes and trees and bushes.  Being the outdoor
adventurous sorts we knew every blade of grass in the park too.  The net
result?  A huge arena!

So I got a group of players together at home and split them up into 2
groups of 2.  One pair sat in my room, one in the spare room.  I then
started each pair off in a different location in the park or school
grounds.  Each player had a noddy character with a UPP of 777777 and a
choice of any weapon - RAM grenade launchers and FGMP-15s were the most
popular :-) 

Their mission?  Kill the other pair.  As all 5 of us knew the grounds
inside out I had no need to describe the layout - everyone knew exactly
what each bush looked like.  I just flitted back and forth between the
two pairs, giving them equal time slots. Sometimes I\'d throw in a few
NPCs running around, sometimes not.

These were some of the best games we ever had.

Thanks for bringing back such fond memories :-)

Pete.

They do indeed migrate, Steve. And faster than you might realize, in all
sorts of crazy directions at once.

Right now the Solar System is migrating at about 20km/second, roughly in
the direction Vega. This doesn\'t seem terribly fast - I believe it works
out to about 0.0003 lightyears every 1000 years (I just happen to have been
working out these figures yesterday). That seems awfully slow. But
remember, all the other stars are also migrating, along different vectors.
The relative speeds can be surprising: Barnard\'s Star (IIRC) is moving much
faster than any of the others in the local group, for instance. (Does
anyone have the figure for Barnard\'s?)

Go back in time about 10,000 years and the constellations would be hard to
recognize due to stellar drift. Most of these stars are a heck of a long
way away, so they must be moving awfully fast relative to each other, and
to us, to exibit this kind of obvious drift.

Does this mean that the stars in the Core Subsector could have reshuffled
themselves over a period of just 1000 years? Well.... only if we assume
that they\'re moving at much greater relative velocities than the stars in
our local group. Which might not be impossible. I don\'t own any maps of the
Core sector from the Third Imperium era, so I can\'t take a stab at what
those velocities might be - anyone care to guess?

An amazing coincidence: I was just last weekend discussing this very topic
with a fellow Canadian SF writer who is an astronomer (actually, he\'s got
degrees in Physics, Astronomy, AND the History and Philosophy of Science!).
I was saying that I felt that border maintenance would be difficult in a
long-lived galactic empire, partly because colonies would be slowly
wandering off into other parts of the galaxy, while alien colony worlds
blundered into "our" territory. He agreed and said it would take only a few
thousand years in some cases.

Stars, however, are not known to be carried off by African or European
swallows. Gripped by the husk or otherwise.

An astronomer at RICE university has a web-page devoted (in part) to the
LISM, or Local InterStellar Medium, with detailed, beautiful, color .jpg
maps of our region of space, seen flat-on, looking \'down\' from Galactic
North. One map is 500 parsecs across; the other is 120 pc. And both are
paired with color paintings of the same regions, plus a painting of the
whole galaxy (~25,000pc across). The maps show (with some guesswork I
suspect), the warmer/thinner areas of the LISM, and the cooler/denser areas
surrounding them, various nebulae and dark clouds, several agglomerations
of O & B type stars, and a large number of bright stars are labeled. The
huge gaseous structures of the Local Bubble, The Wall, The Local Fluff, and
Loops I through III are shown, and also the Pleiades, Polaris, T Tauri, the
"Aquila Rift" and so on. The big gaseous loops aren\'t nebulae, just denser
regions of "vacuum", probably being blown outward by the remnant heat of
ancient supernovae, making the bubbles. It\'s amazing - at this scale, space
looks like the froth on top of a milkshake.

Compare the 500pc map to the Traveller Imperium map for some surprises: the
Imperium seems... well, rather *puny*. This vast empire covers only about
10% of the map. Out beyond the Zhodani consulate is the Aquila Rift, over
180pc long. The Solomani Sphere is, coincidentally, just about
circumscribed by the gaseous wall of the Local Bubble, beyond which (to
Rimward) are the Pleiades, T Tauri, the Taurus Dark Cloud, the Medusa
Nebula, and further huge, unidentified loops of cool gas. Too bad there\'s
no nebula where the Dark Nebula sector would be. The "inner edge" of the
Orion Arm would be some ways off of the Coreward (top) side of the  map,
and the centre of the Galaxy at least four meters away! At the same scale
(about 20pc to the cm), a map of the entire galaxy would be 12.5m across...

Look for it at:

<http://spacsun/rice.edu/~twg/lism.html>

If you know of any similar downloadable maps, I\'d be very interested. (And
yes, I know about the 3-D Star Map website with the Gliese program).

  IMHO it is an expression of the same sentiment GDW expressed when they
back in 92 said that \'There\'s so much written for Traveller that nobody
can keep it all straight, that\'s why we are starting over with TNE\', not
any money-making scheme.

high demand, drinking water transport must be a fairly big business, 
especially in the Lunion subsector.  My question is, what sort of factors 
would come into play when shipping drinking water to a dry world?

Here is what I\'ve got so far:

1 gallon of water = 3.8 liters
1 gallon of water = 9 pounds = 4.05 kilograms
246 gallons = 935 liters = 1 metric ton (approximately)
base price for 1 ton of cargo is Cr.5,000 (T4, pg 166).

Using Ianic as an example:  Rich (+1000), Desert(+1000), E- Starport (+3000) 
the price of one ton of water shipped in would be 10,000 credits per ton! 
I ignored the TL modifier since water on a high TL world is the same as on a 
low TL world.

So...
Cr.10,000/246=40.65 credits per gallon or Cr.10,000/935=10.7 credits per liter

A captain of a subsidized merchant could clear an easy 2 million credits per 
trip!  All he would need is to run a fire hose from a hanger in Derchon or 
Lunion and fill his specially fitted cargo bay to capacity and viola!  His 
ship could be paid off in no time...

Unless Ianic can locate water from an alternate source, or it is provided via 
another method, it seems like water transport is a gold mine for characters!

What other factors should I take in consideration to balance out this seeming 
inequity in things.  Ianic has a population in the millions!  How could they 
supply their TL 5 society with enough drinking water every day for their 
people, livestock, agriculture?  (not to mention coolant for their vehicles, 
wet-cell batteries, bathing, cooking, manufacturing, etc.)  It seems to me 
that every day must be a crisis for these people unless the planetiod belt is 
full o\' icey chunks. 

Comments anyone?

Well, traveller@MPGN.COM is the original and correct address. It is the one
I use. The NS one is just a recent alias for it. As both work you can use
either, but using both gives all of us double vision. :-)

I\'ve been part of a group who killed themselves....

If somehow is making a divebombing run on you in a vehicle using
aerodynamic lift, you do *not* want to merely kill the pilot. At least
not while he is in the dive.

Why? Because if you do, and haven\'t otherwise damaged the vehicle,
instead of just the bomb, you have the *entire* vehicle, with all its
fuel and weapons load impacting fairly close to the aim point for the
bomb.

Oops! That *hurts*. :-)

It requires Binhex. It\'s also probably a Macintosh file.

All the ones I have encountered start with a line that says something
like "this file requires BinHex 4.0 to decode", and that line is
*required* for the decoder to recognize the file.

On a PC the latest version is PCBinHex 1.3, which is available at
Uminn.edu and the Simtel mirrors.

In case you hadn\'t noticed, this sort of situation *would* qualify as a
major emergency. And given both the Depression and WWII as precedents,
you\'d better believe that in time of "national emergency" the
government *can* "draft" you into civilian jobs.

Funny, I don\'t recall ever seeing guard units called up for duty
outside a state that was suffering from a major disaster. I do notice
lots of them getting called from states that *aren\'t* in such a state.

Please allow for the use of some common sense.

Ahem. What have *you* been smoking? The "unemployment rate" in the US
has been a fiction since the 60s.

*Official* unemployment rates may be running that low. In case you
weren\'t aware of it, they quit counting you as unemployed if you are no
longer "officially" looking for work. There are quite likely *more*
people who aren\'t working but aren\'t counted as "unemployed" than there
are who are *officially* unemployed.

And that\'s not counting all the "under employed". Folks working at
minimum wage, but with the skills to do a lot better.

I suggest that you take a *good* look at the *real* employment
situation. 

In any case, you don\'t need to get *everything* going, and you can
prioritize things. First priority are the easy to restart things (like
oil fields) and the things that *have* to get restarted no matter how
difficult.

You *totally* misunderstood my reference to the Congo. It was the prime
example of the "robber baron" model of colonization during the late
19th & early 20th century. It fits *your* description quite well, and
as you note, it wasn\'t much good for *anything*. Thus, neither would
colonies run your way.

We seem to be able to learn. The Alaska boom didn\'t cause near the
trouble that the 1849 rush did. Of course, the fact that what was being
produced had *real* value, not just "artificial" value (gold is *not*
worth what gets paid for it, oil is)

And I\'ll through your "economics" arguement right back at you. Given a

which wins if both are adequate for the job?

And I\'ll "utter nonsense" right back at you. That may be what you do if
you are *exporting* the output of the mine. But there are going to be
mines producing material for *local* use. And it makes *no* economic
sense to waste a starship on hauling stuff point to point on the
planet. A "shuttle" type vehicle is a different matter.

And don\'t forget, it makes more sense to "refine" ore on-planet, and
ship anything "ingots" or the like than to ship raw ore.

And that puts you one step from starting to make things from the metal.

Only problem is, that won\'t be for things like metal production.
There\'s no way a low tech mine can compete with a high tech fusion
setup. Especially if they are shipping *ore* rather than *metal*.

If they are mining something like gemstones, that\'s different, but the
odds against anyone finding a gem deposit without having a *lot* of
people crawling around on the ground are pretty slim.

So the mines would be on planets that were being colonized for some
*other* reason.

And there aren\'t going to *be* mining colonies of that sort. Please
tell me *what* they are mining with low tech means that is worth the
trouble? And how did they locate the deposit in the first place?

And would the town be there if someone hadn\'t found the deposit by
tramping over the ground? Even with advanced sensors, *damn* few
deposits are going to located via remote sensing. And the ones that are
are going to be stuff that is rather *large* (iron, copper..) that is
gonna be stuff that\'s not worth dealing with except via a high tech
mine *or* for *local* use.

Vacuum worlds also require a rather high minimum tech level just to
survive. And the most likely building materials are going to be iron,
aluminum, and fused silica, all of which as *easily* extracted from
"random" chunks of rock (you can extract magnetite from the regolith
with a magnet!). Given a fusion raector and a few other things,
building materials are *easy*.

But you won\'t *have* mining colonies on vacuum worlds. They lack the
geophysical forces (mostly water) that create ore bodies.

If the world isn\'t suitable for normal agriculture, then you\'ll have

And they require special reasons for people to live on them. As well as

*You* are assuming "mining colony". I am assuming a colony that is
mining as a way to pay for imports. A *much* different situation. And a

Not really. If they are mining some metal ore, it takes very little
extra to produce metal ingots. And very little beyond *that* to add the

You don\'t send transportees to inhospitable worlds unless you have no
alternative or you are willing to pay the *high* support costs. Unless,
that is, you are using it as a thinly disguised death sentence.

Excuse me? The industrial revolution occured in the 1800s! And it only
involved *millions* of people. The only people outside of Europe
"required" were the folks raising cotton in India (which is what fed
the cotton mills).

I think you need to put aside your economics texts and look at some
history of technology. The "Connections" series is pretty good, even if
there are errors.

What is needed is a certain amount of infrastructure, not some specific
population.

Sure. As soon as you get "general purpose" robots, you don\'t need
*people* to build and maintain things, just the robots.

For that matter, look at *low* tech levels. It takes more people
working together to sustain an agricultural society (say ancient
Assyria) than it does to support a hunter gatherer culture.

But as you add in technology, you are decreasing the percentage of the
population devoted to raising food, and ditto for most other tasks. You
do increase the number of tasks, and often the resources. 

But as an example, you *cannot* maintain a Assyrian level culture with
less that 10,000 or so people! It takes that many to keep the
irrigation systems working! (along with the food storage and
distribution).

Yet 10,000 people in an area with the right resources can maintain a
late medieval early renaisance tech level too. Possibly later,
depending on what resources are available.

This sort of thing tends to be *cyclic*. Any given technology (and
agriculture *is* a technology) starts out as something that only a few
people do. Then as it improves, it takes more people to keep the
improved (but crude) technology working. Finally, when it matures, you
are back to needing very few people.

the 1990 US$.

A ton of food could be a ton of wheat or rice (cheap) or a ton of
saffron (hideously expensive at around $5 per *gram*).

Same sort of argument goes for other things. And we also need to worry
about the difference between "bulk" (displacement ton) and mass (metric
ton). The ship has limited *volume* for cargo *and* limits on the mass
it can carry.

Where did I sauy "high port"? An orbital station suitable for a colony
is little more than a ship with no drive, and some extra living and
cargo space. Parking cargo in orbit requires a sunshade (cheap,
reusable foil) and a tether (cheap space grade cable). Or you can skip
the tether and use a 50 cent radar corner to make it stand out on radar.

Not computers. Automation. It takes *fewer* people to run an automated
production line than to run a non-automated one, for the same output.

Worst case example, once you reach the tech level that allows robots,
you can have robots producing robots and producing everything else. All
you need people for is supervisory stuff, and design work.

As long as you have a cvouple of robot production plants and the
robotic mines to supply materials, you are fine. Knock out the plants
producing the robotsm and people are in big trouble.

Also, note that in this scenario they are *maintaining* a technology,
not advancing.

Metamorphosis: Alpha was GW\'s direct ancestor. It was A bit more
D&Dish, and it was set aboard a *huge* generation ship that\'d had an
accident. I rather suspect that it owed a lot to the short lived 70\'s
SF program "The Starlost".

While you\'d have to do a MAJOR rewrite, I think it\'d be an interesting
thing to do to some players. They find this ship that is an ellipsiod
about 20x30x5 *kilometers*. "Decks" are hundreds of meters tall, and
mimic natural environments. But the surviving animals and passengers
(sometimes hard to tell which is whic) have been affected by exposure
to high radiation of some unknown type. Areas of the ship are still
contaminated, and there\'s all this tech that nobody knows how to fix,
but a few know how to run...

I\'d let it happen. And unless there were some sort of oaths involved,
I\'d leave any retribution to the players.

I spent *far* too many years gaming with a group that *forbade* PCs to
attack each other, regardless of the justifucation.

Remember the bit with the idiot insulting the Samurai? The same player
(if not the same *character* was *continually* doing stupid things.
Like when attacked by some ochre jelly, and realizing that fire is one
of the effective attacks, he fireballs them. Never mind that he and the
rest of the party will all be *inside* the fireball (narrow corridor).
Half the party died, many of the rest took damage. He saved. 

In real life, he\'d have had an "unfortunate accident" not long after,
if he wasn\'t slain out of hand. Instead, the DM told us we were *not*
allowed to try killing him, then or later...

I alnost had one of my PCs kill another. My character was a Samurai,
and didn\'t approve of the way the party was going to torture a prisoner
for info. He couldn\'t talk them out of it, so he volunteered himself
for guard duty so he wouldn\'t be watching. That made one of the other
players get paranoid. He accused my character of planning to desert
them, or let in enemies or some such.

My character drew himself up and said "I have given my word as a
Samurai to act as part of the party."

The other character started to make a comment that *everyone* knew was
going to be "I\'m not sure that\'s good enough". Everyone (except the
idiot playing him) was also aware that about the time he finished
saying hit, my character would have drawn sword and decapitated him for
the insult. And then taken my chances with the rest of the party.

The idiot got as far as "I\'m.." before he was *forcibly* silenced by
other characters who figured that we didn\'t need a war just then. :-)

I\'ve also had a character who essentially committed suicide (by
attacking a demon prince on his own turf) to "atone" for having had to
bug out on a party. It worked. It saved the party. He died, but hey, he
did what he had to.

Back in high school I had the pleasure of refereeing two big scams.

In the first, the players decided to be thieves - stealing from the rich and
giving to the poor (the latter was their insurance policy: they figured that
if they were caught they\'d be able to plead for leniency because of all the
hospital\'s they\'d built).  As a cover, they decided on a music band that was
reviving the ancient Terran style of \'stone music\' - so, appropriately
enough, began the "Crime of the Century" tour.  Thefts always took place
during the concert, so they could cover for each other (hard to tell who was
who under the costumes and makeup), and were timed for the song "Crime of the
Century" if possible.  Great fun.

In the second, one of the players decided that he would have more fun
stealing from PCs, so he conned them out of their starship.  They got mad,
stole another starship, chased and caught him intending to space him, and he
conned them out of the starship while they had a gun to his head in the
airlock!  After the game they couldn\'t quite remember why they let him do it,
except that it seemed a good idea at the time.  (If any of you have met Gary
Gregor, you\'ll understand how he did it.)

No problem.  I still use their character\'s skills, I just insist that they
role-play the character.  I don\'t care if they can _do_ a German accent, but
they have to try.  (And I still get laughs when I say "mad Russian", as the
remember my attempts to do a slurred Russian accent!)

Then there was the T2k game we did (Castle by the Sea).  Eddie Kim was on
point, loaded for a small war and sneaking through the caverns in the dark. 
I told him to close his eyes and mime how he was moving so I understood what
his characetr was doing. (Standard technique I use, BTW.)  While he was doing
this I snuck up behind him and clutched his pant leg.  He jumped a mile,
whirled around and leveled his \'rifle\', then cracked up - I was on my knees,
sucking my thumb, playing a scared 3-year-old boy!  So there\'s Eddie, hunting
through his grenades, ammo, spare guns, knives, and C4 for a candy to make
the boy feel better (so he doesn\'t scream).  Then the whole group of
rough-tough warriors had to role-play convincing a small child to \'play
soldier\' and keep quiet (Eddie wouldn\'t let anyone hurt \'his\' boy).  One of
the best games we ever had.

The Bible analogy is ironic.  Those who study the bible academically (of
which my wife was one for a short time) tend to argue not only about which
books of "The Bible" are valid or came first, but how those books are
interpreted and translated, and what else was probably included as part of
what we call "The Bible" that was excised in the course of history for its
"sacreligous" content by the powers that were.  

"Canon" (which is a term referring originally to religious works) for the
bible nowadays depends very much on which religon you belong to.  Jewish
Canon includes the Torah (old testament I believe) plus a tremendous
number of works dating from long ago/at the time the Bible was written
(i.e. the Dead Sea Scrolls for example) up through relatively recent works
of exceptionally wise people.  Catholic Canon also includes a tremendous
amount of older material, plus the New Testament.  Islam adds to (not
replaces) the Canon with the Koran.

At one point some smart aleck on this list made a reference comparing the
three (at the time) versions of Traveller to the three Biblical religious
groups;

CT= Old Testament
MT= New Testament
TNE = The Koran

So; 

CT Players = Jews
MT Players = Christians
TNE Players = Moslem

Does that make all of us T4 Players "Jews for Jesus"?

I must admit, a mother of two teenagers working as a social
worker who assesses the elderly and their \'care\' needs and
frantically busy youth leader of a church, doesn\'t strike me
as the \'average\' Traveller player that leaps to my mind.  But
why not?

Considering her job involves visiting elderly care patients
who may have died in the height of summer and not been found
for 10 days, (yes, this really did happen), a bit of
\'escapism\' probably doesn\'t go amiss.

Sounds good, but what is a \'barge\' table?  Come to think of
it, I played a game once sitting on the boundary of a cricket
pitch watching Mike Gatting and friends.  For the
non-UK/Commonwealth/ex-Commonwealth folk
here, this is ideal because a) the average cricket match is
several hours (even days) and b) in between each ball bowled
is a lot of sitting around waiting for the next ball to be
bowled.

I\'m guessing this means All You Can Drink

If so, do you *really* have such places???

<Flame Retardant Suit On>
At the risk of starting a flame war, I must take exception to the above 
comment. I have been playing Traveller since the days of the little black 
box, as well as other RPG\'s, but CCG\'s have captured my imagination like 
nothing else since those early Traveller days.

<Rant Mode On>
It isn\'t *just* a card game. When one plays Bridge, Cribbage, Poker or 
any other card game, you are playing with abstract little clubs, 
diamonds, hearts and spades and the *same* 52 cards.

With CCG\'s, you construct your own deck, and as you play it, that deck 
develops its own personality. Sometimes its personality is different from 
that you intended when you first built it!

But I\'ve always found, no matter which game I play, that there is a story 
developing. Each game has its setting and characters, and in each game 
the players struggle for supremacy, or mere survival. Sure, it\'s even 
more abstract than most RPG\'s, and there is no verbal narrative (unless 
someone watching or playing supplies it :-) but the narrative is played 
out during the game and in the minds of the competitors.

I challenge any one to say the same about Bridge! (The great mage 
Ckhron-thos bids 2 Spades, steeling himself for his opponents 
rebuttal...)

Ah, this is where we agree.

RPG\'s will never die. Neither will other forms of Role-playing, be they 
the Society for Creative Anachronism, Improvisational Theatre or a host 
of others... But just as reading a fantasy novel is a more abstract and 
less free-form way of role-playing, so too is playing a CCG. (Although I 
would say a CCG is even more free-form than RPG\'s, as well as more 
abstract than a novel)

  In my campaign it is easy: You Never Leave The Scouts, you just
go on detached duty. Since, technically, you are still a scout (you can
be called up and) you have access to free fuel and facilities at any
Scout base. That can often be worth a lot more than any pension.

  No, no, you have it the wrong way around. TAS does not award membership
for _anything_. They are not a public service, just a private club. When you
get a "TAS Membership" benefit it is because your chosen career has
bought it from TAS on your behalf.

Actually, the Dead Sea Scrolls are some of the oldest copies we have of
some of the Old Testament books. They refute some of the arguments
brought forth by "liberal" scholars, who would argue, for example, that
there were two Isaiahs that were edited centuries later by the Rabbis into
one book. The copy of Isaiah in the Dead Sea Scrolls predates any copy
we had before, and it is all one book.

Come now, we can do better than that!

Random Bar Encounter Tables; 

Table 1 Drunkeness (assumes active intake)
By the end/middle of the evening the character is (2d6)
2. Passed out under a table, +8 on the Getting Lucky Table
3. Really Drunk plus has other intoxicants (appropriate to character and
location) in her/his system.  Actions are very uncontrolled. +6 on Getting
Lucky Table.  50% chance of forcible emptying of stomach contents
4. "Quite Drunk", other intoxicants optional (25% chance).  +4 on Getting
Lucky table. 10% chance of forced stomach content ejection.  Actions
uncontrolled.
5. "Toasted", +2 on Getting Lucky Table, Actions are poorly controlled. 
6. "Buzzing", +2 on Getting Lucky table, Judgement is very impaired.
7. Tipsy, Judgement impaired, +1 on "getting Lucky" Table  
8. "High", Euphorics are primary intoxicants, judgement impaired, +2 on
getting lucky table.  Happy feeling with 5% chance of a paranoid event.
9. "Flying", Euphorics, Judgement truly unreliable, +3 on getting lucky
table.  20% chance of a paranoid event.  
10. "Wicked High", Truly stratoshperic, Occasional belief in ability to
fly without a grav belt, Judgement nonexistant.  50% chance of a paranoid
event, +4 on the getting lucky table.
11. "Crashing", A bit overdone, rather than wanting to fly, this person
wants to die.  Paranoid events are 100% likely, 50% chance of mixed
substances which could lead to stomach ejection (25%) which will probably 
make this person feel better anyway.  +6 on get lucky table.
12. "Doing the Belushi", Get this poor sod medical treatment.  State:
Comatose, definite mixed substances present.  


2. The Get lucky table
Bars are often a place where people go to get picked up.  However, they
are not often a good place to go to get picked up.  Reroll results which
do not make any sense for the setting.

2A. How Lucky
Apply the get lucky DM from the drunkeness table.

2. Character goes home with the most attractive being (of their
preference) in the place (which is not always saying much).  They have a
beautiful experience together.  Subsequent events to be decided by the GM.

3. Character goes home with an attractive being (add 4 to partner type
roll.  The experience is excellent.
 
4-6. Character Goes home with someone.  add 2 to partner type roll, The
experience is rated on a d10 roll, "10" being excellent, "1" being
impotent.  Use positive DM from drunkeness table as a negative DM on the
experiance rating.  If the character did not imbibe at all, add 3.

7-9. Character is rejected.  They may roll again at the very end of the
night with a +4 "desperateness" penalty.

10. Character goes home with someone, anyone, out of desperation or
intoxication. Use the same method of rating the experience as in 4-6, but
with a -2 DM.  Generally a cheap encounter.  no modification to the
partner type table.

11. Character sleeps with "something that moves".  50% chance that they
have sex in a restroom or phone booth (or other appropriate setting).
Always a cheap experience.  Apply a -2 to the partner type roll.  Apply a
- -4 to the experience rating roll.
 
12. "I remember Going home with this person, but not what happened when
we got there."  Character blanks or blacks out when at the scene of the
encounter.  Apply a -5 to the experience roll (for the other participant,
the character remembers nothing).  If not intoxicated, the character is
"slipped a mickey" by their potential partner.

13. "Oh my god, who is this next to me and where am I"  The character
remembers nothing after entering the bar the night before.  Partner roll
is at -3 (effectively random).  just roll a d6 for the experience rating.  

14. "Oh my god, *WHAT* is this next to me and where am I"  Apply a -5 to
the partner roll.  If human, This partner is quite scary and potentially
(50%) dangerous (per the GM, one suggestion : Obsessive directed at the
character).    
 
2B. Partner Type (2d6)
Use this table to determine whether the characters lover is male, female
or alien (if alien, roll without modifications, if another alien results,
this creature is from an alien race without the usual two sexes, GM should
make something interesting up).

Example, A (generally) heterosexual human male rolls a 5 on this table,
lover is a human male
 
2 or 3 "My Alien Lover" 
4 to 6  Contrary to Usual preferences 
7 to 12 Usual Preference

(Note: Characters should determine their level of homophobia/heterophobia
or xenophobia and react as is appropriate to such an encounter)

Optional Modifiers;

If you use charisma, A character with a high charisma should get a -1 for
every point above 8 on the Getting Lucky table.

If chasing a specific person, events should be decided by the GM.

The getting Lucky table assumes the character is actively seeking a sexual
encounter.  If they are not, but are "quite drunk" or "flying" or worse,
roll anyway.  If they still aren\'t rolling, there is a 50% chance
(modified by +5% for each charisma point over 8, -5% for each charisma
point below 6, and 5% for each SS point over 9) they will be hit apon by
someone else.  use the drunkeness and partner type tables to determine the
state of the potential lover.

Certain people seem to always be able to find just the lover they want on
any place, at any time, no matter what their state.  This often goes along
with a high charisma as well.  If the GM decides a PC or (more likely) NPC
leads such  "blessed" life, give them a -3 to -8 modifier on the get lucky
table, as appropriate.

If a character expresses no sexual preference (or rather, expresses that
they prefer one sex no more than the other) use the Lover type table to
determine only whether the lover is alien, then roll gender randomly
(50-50).

Cheap Slut Bonus. (aka "Rob\'s DM").  Someone with a reputation for
"sleeping around" has a higher likelyhood of getting the cheap end of the
encounter table, and of getting any at all.  apply the -4 desperation
modifier to anyone who fits this category, and allow them to make a second
roll if they are rejected at the same DM.

Persuasion, Act/Bluff, etc.  Certain skills can modify the rolls on this
table.  Depending on the version of traveller you use, apply the skill
level (not asset) for persuasion skill as a dm to the getting lucky table
(subtract the skill level from the roll) and to the partner type table
(add the skill to the roll).  All modifiers are additive by the way.
Other skills should be treated the same way if the GM decides they are
applicable.

See, I told you we could do better!

True, we all need a common frame of reference when discussing 
Traveller... as with any other topic.  So there /is/ a reason to have 
"canon."  But, how much of the material should be "canon?"

I think I have a solution.  Let\'s mandate that everyone here buy every 
single Traveller item produced by IG, use ONLY those items, and never 
have any house rules or third-party rules whatsoever.  If you\'re not 
willing to do this, then you don\'t belong on TML.  [Stern Glare]

Yeah, that\'d work. :)

Yup.  I think the #1 favorite activity of TML participants is rules 
tinkering.  :)

Nope.  "Inigo" -- tilde on the \'n\'.  Pronounced something like 
"in-YEE-goh".  "My name is Inigo Montoya.  You killed my father.  Prepare 
to die."  "Stop *saying* that!" :)

And by the way, PB was a book long before it was a movie.  Should be

In the RC setting, the planet Lucifer is a haven for crackpots mystics

groups to join, so I made up a few.  I tried to write them from the
perspective of the group, so when I say Blipdooppop destroyed the
Ancients, this is what her followers think. I am not changing Traveller
Canon.  These are just quick sketches of the groups, feel free to

wacko group of your, I\'d love to see it.
Lewis Roberts

Phos/Skotos: Phos is is the god of light and good, his counterpart is 
Skotos, the god of darkness and evil.  Phos promises that the virtuous 
will reside in paradise for eternity.  Skotos promises power in the 
material world and in the hereafter for those who will help him in
his foul plans. The Vampires serve him, and the Virus was his handiwork.
    Divine Journey Enterprises goes out into the Wilds and trades the
natives high tech equipment. They also preach the gospel of Phos
while they are there.  They resell the native goods back in the RC,
using the proceeds to finance more missions into the Wilds.  The 
company has two far traders, Divine Guidance and Phos\' Will.  The 
church is fairly wide spread, and has upwards of 5000 members on
Lucifer and a sprinkling in the Wilds.  
							
Natural Philosophy Society: The Society is less a religion, and more,
as its name suggests, a group dedicated to espousing a philosophy.
They believe that magic is real, and they can cast spells.  They 
try to cast spells that will help the RC overcome its problems.
They have seven small chapter-houses across Lucifer, and a major
house in the capital.  The local members gather at their house every
seventh day. Each chapter-house gathers on a different day of the week,
so that one of the chapter-house is always active.  At their meetings
members teach each other the magic principals that they know, and 
decide which spells the Chapter-house will work on casting.  Most spells
take many weeks of preparations, and involved gathering many different
exotic substances.  Finally when a spell is to be cast, the group
travels to the Motherhouse, and casts it there.  The Motherhouse is
centered on the intersection of several powerful Ley Lines, so any
spells cast there are much more effective.  Individual group members
may cast spells on their own, but they are much more effective as a 
group.  The group is rather benign and seeks to help Lucifer and the
rest of the RC.  It has over a thousand members on Lucifer, and not many
elsewhere.

Blipdooppop-Blipdooppop is an Elder God. She existed long before the
Ancients, and will exist long after humanity has ceased to be.  
She is awesomely powerful, and demands that all intelligent beings
worship her.  The Ancients refused, and she destroyed them.  Before
they died though they were able to use some arcane technology to 
lock Blipdooppop in another dimension where she is unable to help
her followers.  Her believers are split into two camps, those who 
seek to free her and those which seek to prevent this.  Those who
wish to free her, believe that she will grant them eternal life,
and domain over the rest of the humans, when she conquers the universe.
The others also believe that she will destined to conquer the universe,
but wish to prolong it to a time when they are long dead.  
    The two groups do agree that the Hivers are her most dedicated
servants.  This causes the Hivers a great deal of confusion, when
strange humans come up and ask how they can help serve the Great
One. The Hivers act very confused by this, but the followers of 
Blipdooppop assume it is all a very carefully crafted plan of the
devious Hivers.  Both groups have about 2000 members.

Cult of the Star: The Cult believes that their guru, Seala Borgun, is 
the avatar of the Divine Spirit.  As such her word is law, and 
they follow here every wish and command.  Unfortunately for her
followers Seala is quite mad.  She has them do absurd things, which
they happily do.  She once had a hundred of her followers dress
in animal costumes and dance up and down the main thoroughfare.

Anelimism-Anelimism is not an organized religion that believes in
a divine being that must be worshiped, rather it is a philosophy,
that guides its followers through life.  Anelimism says spirits inhabit
all objects. Objects are represented both on the material
plane and on the spirit plane.  The followers of Anelimism respect 
those spirits and always ask their permission before destroying
an object. The destruction of an object also destroys the spirit.
The followers are saddened by any destruction, and take great joy
in the creation of new objects.  All objects have a spirit part, even
crude objects such as roads, buildings, and vehicles.  The Anelimists
treasure skills such as painting, sculpture, woodworking, 
   Anelimists occasionally will ask favors of the spirits, such as
asking the spirit of a car to continue working until the supplicant
is home safely.  The supplicant will then later make an offering to the
spirit.

Church of Stellar Divinity-The Church of Stellar Divinity is wide
spread throughout the Imperium, it believes that Stars are divine
beings and need to be worshiped.  If a believer is faithful, after
his death, his spirit will merge with the stars.  On Parvid a 
heretical branch of the church sprang up. This branch believes that
the stars are at war with each other, and that people from other planets
are followers of another star, and must be destroyed.  The branch of
the church that existed on Luhtala, took this heresy one step farther
and believes that it is the duty of all believers to help fight the
war against the other stars. 
     Before the Collapse, the group was actively seeking to locate
a working copy of the mythical star trigger. (See Darrians)  With
such a device, they could destroy entire stars, and help Lutala\'s
star, Amicron, win supremacy.  
	One possible plot is for the Church to fly in to an enemy star
system and fire canisters of radioactive waste in to a star.  They
realize this won\'t destroy the star, but feel that it might weaken
the star enough so Amicron might take advantage of its momentary
weakness.  
	The Church also wants to make a device in which they could
actually enter the atmosphere of the star and commune directly with
Amicron.  For a possible design see the book Sundiver by David Brin.
	
Angar-The Angar worship a pantheon of gods. They believe
that nature is a mirror of the Gods. Reality reflects the nature
of the gods.  If one of the Gods was to die or be changed, reality
would also be changed.  Many of the faithful believe that such
that Tulko, god of Voyages, died and this caused the collapse.
Now that the RC is rebuilding society, they believe a new god
has emerged and is helping restart voyages among the stars.  This
new god\'s image, shows a sixfold symmetry, much like a hiver does.
(I haven\'t created a full pantheon of gods, I was going to take
a list of gods from the Finnish gods, in the AD&D book, Dieties and
Demigods Cyclopedia, change the names and appearence and eliminate
a few inapproriate gods.  Any other pantheon would work as well.)

Academy of the Mind- The Academy believes that they can teach 
anyone to be a psychic.  They detest the term psion, saying
that it reeks of Imperial propaganda.  They use many crystals,
pyramids, and weird herbs in their lessons.  They don\'t try
to teach telekinitic arts, or others that have a definite impact
on the material world, rather they teach empathy, fortune telling
and the use of mental powers to offset illness.  (ie. things that
can\'t be proven not to have worked)  The Academy is 130 years old.
The Imperials, carefully investigated the group, and determined that 
they were frauds, and harmless. The Academy claimed to have used
mind control on the Imperial Inquisitors.

Church of the Ancients- The Church of the Ancients believes that the
Ancients took humanity from ancient Terra and scattered them among the
stars for a reason.  The Ancients were fighting a war against an 
powerful enemy, when they forced the Enemy to flee to another dimension.
The Ancients decided to follow the Enemy and make sure of his destruction.
Before they left they spread humanity across many different star systems
so that they would be assured of at least some of the humanity	
							   

Church of the Ancients-The Church believes that the Ancients were 
wise and benevolent creatures, who took humanity from its homeworld,
of Terra in order to teach it a better way.  Before the Ancients 
could enlightenment humanity, they evolved onto a higher plane.  
The Church seeks to continue the enlightenment of humanity.  
They try to figure out the process in which the Ancients evolved
onto a higher plane, by examining whatever Ancient artifacts that
they can get their hands on.  These artifacts are extremely rare,
and the Church guards them carefully.  Many members have been 
conned into buying clever forgeries.  
	The Church recognizes that the Ancients also took and genetically
engineered Terran wolves, into Vargr.  The Church honors and accepts
the Vargr as fellow sapiens on the path towards enlightenment.  Droyne
were also known to be servants to the Ancients, and the Church 
accepts them also.  
	Church members seek to enlighten themselves through meditation.
They often use replicas of Ancient artifacts in their meditations.
The Church is favorably disposed to the RC, and believes that it
can help enlighten the rest of humanity.  The Church often sponsors
missions to recover known and suspected Ancient artifacts.

I also thought that the Disciples of the Bright Way, as recently
presented by Michael Barry, made an excelent addition to this list.  
I added the feature that looking at Jump space made people mentally
unbalanced people, just so I could use those wackos.

Coupla Possibilities and clarifications;

A world with a hydrographics rating of zero does *not* necessarily have no
water.  The range is for zero to 9% (I think) of the *surface* of the
planet.  This would (If I recall correctly again) include water trapped in
ice caps.

The amount of drinkable water on Earth which is art of our hydro rating is
probably less than 1%.  Most of our water is in unpotable oceans (and a
significant part of the remainder in being poisoned by industry - but
that\'s another story).  We have immense underground reserves of clean h2o
available for drinking, washing, etc.

So the rating may not reflect the actual availability of water, only the
percentage of surface area which is water.

Another possibility is that they have much less water available, but still
plenty for the population\'s drinking needs.  This culture would substitute
other products for water whenever possible in industry, and in daily life.
Dune\'s culture would make a good example of this.

A third possibility is that they have found some new and interesting way
of making or gathering water on an otherwise waterless world.  Some may be
trapped in subterrainian ice around the poles (which, being subterrainian,
wouldn\'t show up on the Hydro rating) suspended in the air (and
collectable) or perhaps there are large available hydrogen and oxygen
supplies (in the form of hydrochloric acid seas and iron oxide mines)
ahich allow the domestic production of water (albiet expensively - but not
as expensively as shipping it in).

Yet another possibility for high tech societies is that the population is
orbital (or primarily orbital) and water is perfectly or near perfectly
conserved in the closed artificial ecosystem.  Occasional injections (due
to unavoidable regular loss) of new material can be provided by mining icy
bodies in the system (or gasses on/in planets).

Or, finally, you may be right and they may be importing water in huge
quantities from out-of-system.  I find this last possibility economically
very unlikely.  What is it that brought people to this system in spite of
the enormously high cost of just living?  Why so many people?  Perhaps
some enormous disaster eliminated all the water without killing all the
people and now they are in the midst of a relief effort?

Also, could water be better shipped as compressed gasses to be combined at
the destination?  Water (If I remember right) does not compress well in
its liquid form.  But I bet there is a better way to transport it than in
that form.

The Jewish canon is identical to the Old Testament as found in Protestant
Bibles, though the material is organized somewhat differently.  It does 
not include the Dead Sea Scrolls.  These were written after the last 
of the Jewish scriptures were written; however, the Dead Sea Scrolls 
include some of the oldest copies of some of the books of the Jewish canon.

The Torah (= "the Law") is the premier *part* of the canon, the first five 
books -- Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, also called 
the Pentateuch.

The "relatively recent works" are probably the Talmud and the Mishnah.
These are commentaries ON the canon, and have a lot of authority in 
Judaism, but not as much as the canon itself.

>Catholic Canon also includes a tremendous
>amount of older material, plus the New Testament.  Islam adds to (not
>replaces) the Canon with the Koran.

The Catholic canon contains a *small* amount of additional material, called 
the Apocrypha by Protestants.  These are a handful of short books and 
additions to books, all placed in the Old Testament.

Islam regards the Jewish and Christian scriptures as corrupted and no 
longer accurate, and therefore as NOT canonical, or certainly as nowhere 
near as authoritative as the Koran.

There.  Sorry.  Back to your regularly scheduled thread.

First off, I agree with much of your post.  There is nothing wrong with
CCGs, having played Magic and NetRunner I prefer the latter, but;

Bridge is one of the most exciting games I have ever played.

Now, don\'t snicker.  Bridge among those who know how to play approaches
Chess in its mathmatical strategic precision, poker in its blankfaced
bluffing, and rpgs in its edge of your seat tension and cliffhangers.  I
have never had as much adrenalin flowing as when I\'m waiting for my
partner to lay down his hand (as dummy) after bidding up to 6 No Trump in
a fierce bidding war, hoping I interpreted his bids correctly.  Or waiting
to see if the 12th club will fall, making my 5 of clubs the thirteenth,
and therefore the winning trick.

Bridge is awesome.  I assume that my lack of enthusiasm for CCGs (I enjoy
them, but frankly can\'t understand their popularity) is due to a lack of
experience with ardent players.  Please realize your opinion of bridge is
similar.

Pete

P.S. The most dramatic Bridge players I met were A woman in her late 60\'s
and her partner, who was also her mother.  I learned not to mess with
them!

     Better start reaaching for that Extra-Extra-Extra Strength 
Excedrin, Ross... Since we blew up the ship this particular plan is 
now moot, but I think that it\'s funky enough to share with the list.

     For those of you who aren\'t in on what went on, here\'s the 
background: crew was hired for a delivery run at vastly below fair 
rates without being told that the route taken would involve three 
triple jumps into deep space.  Crew decides to get even, but the bank 
rep who set it up has two nasty bodyguards along.  So here is 
what I came up with to solve the problem:

1) Arrive on Lanth.
     a) acquire a contraband weapon

2) Find a member of the local underworld.  Propose to pay him 50% in 
advance to do the following:
     a) hire a gang of toughs and act as go-between/blind for my character
     b) get a hideout and inform my character of its location
     c) plan gang\'s kidnapping of the bank rep and inform my character of it.  The 
         plan is to include suitable roughing up of my character, who is to 
              i) be present
              ii) be left behind as the gang make their getaway
     d) plan is also to include expecting and  firing blank or non-lethal rounds at 
         the eventual rescuers, the crew, following which gang is to 
         make a safe getaway, which rescuers will allow them to do.
             i) alternatively, have some gang members firing lethal 
                munitions at the bodyguards
     e) whacking of bodyguards during kidnapping  is an optional 
         bonus, if feasible

3) Once go-between has reported that the kidnapping has been 
accomplished, whack him and drop him off a pier

4) Knowing the location of the hideout, have my character, during 
period before the ransom demand is delivered, spot one of the 
kidnappers.
     a) Mug said kidnapper (coincidentally having a crewmember along 
         as muscle) and extract the information from him. In order to 
         alleviate risk of having him spill the beans, make sure the fellow 
         crew-member is the paranoid junkie pilot, who\'d go along with it in a 
         flash. Once interrogation is finished, drop the body off a pier.
     b) plan rescue raid with fellow crew-members, who are to be kept 
         in dark as to the non-lethal nature of the opposition.

5) Execute rescue mission, going in loaded for bear; whack all 
members of the gang.  Use the contraband firearm (see 1) a), supra) 
to whack bodyguards during the raid.  Plant the weapon on one of the 
dead gang members

6) Comfort the no-doubt hysterically relieved bank rep.

7) Ask for a raise.

     The fun thing is that this could possibly be accomplished 
without any other crewmembers being involved.  If successful, the 
PC\'s would look like heroes, probably get raises, and have the coast 
cleared somewhat if they eventually decide to hoist the black flag 
and start slitting throats :).

First of all, remember who wrote the Imperial Encyclopedia-it was the guys
from DGP who largely wrote it. If the Sylean Federation had controlled an
entire sector in Year O, there would be no need to explore or map the
sector! And exploration and discovery is what this is all about. My
suggestion is: either wait for the Mileau 0 book to come out in December, or
assume that this is all there is of the Federation (although there may be
more member worlds coreward in the next subsector). One sector, if properly
explored, will keep a group busy for some time. I would pretty much assume
that everything DGP wrote about the Core sector is null and void.
        Another option is to assume that an AREA of the sector hasn\'t been
explored for some reason, but the rest has.

I have played Bridge and I love it, too (though my experience is lacking, 
an obscure Central-canadian card game called Kaiser is my forte\') I was 
just using Bridge as an example of a standard, abstract card game.

I *did not* imply that CCG\'s *are a kind of* RPG\'s in any way shape or form 
(at least I didn\'t intend to ;-) What I was trying to say is that CCGs are a 
valid expression of Fantasy or Science fiction story-telling, and an 
enjoyable game using a Fantasy/SF setting (IMHO of course, to each his/her 
own). i.e. they are not just simply "a card game".

In the CCGs case, it\'s more random than RPGs (Like rolling on encounter 
tables to see what critters and equipment appear) but events that occur to 
the characters represented by cards are still controlled by the players. 
CCG\'s are more similar to Miniatures war games and some computer strategy 
games (eg. Chaos Overlords) than they are to RPGs--Therefore I contend that 
CCGs are _similar to_  but _absolutely not in the same category as_ RPGs.

Hope this clears up the muddification.

Actually, you didn\'t piss me off...  3 or 4 people in a row,

Frankly, I don\'t know that we\'re going to know a whole lot until 1st 
Survey gets published.  I\'m pretty much holding off on running any 
kind of a year zero campaign until we see what comes down the pike 
from IG...

But I definitely understand your dilemma...

Here\'s 1 of those inconsistencies.  Somewhere else, DGP\'s write up on 
Core sector showed only about a dozen worlds possessed by Sylea...

Actually, the names of bars in my games tend to be kind of a long

A selection of names from over the years:

The Severed Limb
The Blasted Planet
Wasted Space

There are others that I can\'t remember off the top of my head, but 
they\'re definitely a long running gag (cliche?).  It\'s on another posting,

Since I put out the latest version of the Galactic Sector Viewer
last month, several people have contacted me telling me that they
are manually entering more sector data, and some of them expressed
an interest in having their work appear in the program\'s next
release.

The folks who contacted me are:
Dakin Burdick (burdickd@hamlet.ucs.indiana.edu): Magyar Sector
Stu Dollar (sdollar@goodnet.com): Dk. Nebula, Diaspora, Dagudashaag
J.D. Burdick (JD.Burdick@t-online.de): Fornast
Michel Boucher (alsandor@netcom.ca): Beyond, Vanguard Reaches

(As an aside, Charles Collin (charles@hebb.psych.mcgill.ca) has
also been of immense help in enabling the program\'s sector
generator to include the option to use alien names files for naming
worlds in randomly generated alien sectors.)

Now, many of the aforementioned sectors are being created using
sector data and/or world names that were gleaned from official
Traveller supplements (or, in Mike\'s case, Paranoia Press Traveller
supplements). What I\'m wondering is, am I allowed to include these
sectors, seeing as not all the data came from DGP\'s GEnie archive?
I would really like to include these seven sectors with the next
release of the program, but I don\'t want to step on anyone\'s toes.
Of course, the program will be distributed free-of-charge, and I\'ll
be happy to make all the appropriate disclaimers just so people
know that I\'m not trying to usurp anyone\'s copyright or trademarks.
In short, is this okay?

I would generally say no, unless your campaign had a good reason for
allowing it, and then only after a term or two elsewhere.   Of course,
the easy way would be just to add an additional -DM to the roll.

Definitely all full terms.  You may wish distribute mustering rolls
among the tables of the services according to the number of terms served
in each service.

In CT Supp 4, the lab ship is supplied by a scientific foundation and
not disposable by the character, similar to a scout ship.  All it says
about the yacht is \'as described in book 1\'.  Since I found no yacht in
book 1, I have no idea.  There is a 200t yacht (base price 51 MCr) in
book 2, but no reference to it as a benefit.  I\'d probably say use the
merchant ship payment guidelines.  Give that young noble a reason to be
out and about ;-)

First of all...  Not strictly true...  Most of Imperial Encyclopedia

 Why not send your work to _both_?  Freelance Traveller is
 designed to be a strictly electronic "Magazine" for Traveller,
 and a resource of high-quality material, just as JTAS is for
 printed material.  Freelance Traveller doesn\'t require
 exclusivity (both because of my personal philosophy and because
 I\'m not allowed to pay for submissions, or charge for the
 magazine), and will provide an easy-to-remember source to point
 your browser at (how does
 http://www.dragonfire.net/~FreelanceTraveller/ sound?).  In a
 way, FT can act as one of several "core" support sites for
 Traveller, as Sunbane and GEnie did in the past.  The fact that
 Sunbane had a lot of stuff didn\'t prevent material from showing
 up on other\'s ftp sites or web pages; neither should FT.

Pete, I think you should publish these!  I say the "Sex Rules" for D&D
somewhere, maybe you could come up with those for Traveller too and sell the
two in a single product, the TTTC (Totally Tastless Traveller Companion)

Yes, both accidentally and intentionally. In a very early Traveller

there\'ve been more recent occurrences in Trav (unsuccessful) and 
Cyberpunk (most successful).

into the lowest possible common denominator for Traveller players and refs; the 
Starport Bar.

>By the way, anyone ever do a list of Bar names on different worlds???

Here\'s ten of the odder ones from my notebook (I make these things up during 
the game session, write them down, and maybe use them again later):

1.  The Humble Vargr (destroyed by one of my players\' Vargr PC w/ stolen 
FGMP-15)
2.  The Gaseous Anomaly (VERY high-class, hidden in a large hologram of a 
nebula)
3.  The Drop Capsule (first drink free for Marine drop troopers)
4.  The Lifeboat 
5.  The RockDropper (guess what inspired _this_one)
6.  Jump Sickness (unsettling animated holosign out front)
7.  Commando\'s Leg (with a preserved severed leg of a Zhodani commando out 
front)
8.  Norris\' Nostril (This one was in Vargr space, built in a huge (20 meter 
tall) bust of Duke Norris\' head.  The entrance was up some stairs and through 
the nostrils.)
9.  The Tender (huge club inside a retired X-Tender at Glisten)
10. Cafe Terra (a chain of bars all over the Imperium, with robots dressed as 
Solomani/Terran historical figures.  Very BAD historical research; party was 
served by Albert Einstein dressed in a WWII German Officer\'s uniform with 
american insignia, for example)

Some notes on bars that I use for "quickie bar generation" for a Startown bar.
Classes of Bar:
1.  Nightclub - Ultra-swanky place; where the elite meet to eat.  Starport 
needs to be Class A or B, and world needs to be High population, Rich or a 
sector/subsector capital.
2.  Inn - A very nice club, frequented by semi-rich and upper middle class 
types.   Any starport of type A, B or C will have one, if the UPP population 
digit of the world is 4 or higher.
3.  Tavern - Your typical blue-collar establishment.  Holoscreens with local 
sports, pool tables and GravBall Simulators.  Every starport has at least one 
of these (I usually have at least 1 per UPP population digit).
4.  Dive - Similar to a Tavern, but about 50 years older and 75 years dirtier.  
The clientele tend toward the seedier ends of the spectrum, with occasional 
slumming forays by the rich and famous.  You know; the usual place for the 
party to unwind.  Every starport has at least one of these (I usually have at 
least 1 per UPP population digit).

Size and Sundry Details
Determine the number of tables, the number of people at the bar, the presence 
of games,  the presence of live entertainment and the presence of "working 
girls" (guys/sophots.etc).
Tables = UPP Population Digit x 1d6 (1d6-6 tables are open at any given 15 
minute period)
Patrons at Bar = UPP Population Digit x 1d6 (there are 2d6 -6 spots open at the 
bar)
Games = Different tyes of games = 2d6 - UPP Law Level.  Live gambling or gaming 
machines present if  2d6 - UPP Law Level > 0
Live Entertainment = Present if UPP Population Digit - 1d6 > 0
Working Girls = Present if  2d6 - UPP Law Level > 0
Fight (non-PC initiated) = Check once per hour for UPP Population Digit - 3d6 > 
0

Hello, I\'ve greatly anticipated the arrival of T4 unfortunatly I can\'t seem
to find it anywhere.  Anyone have any Ideas.  My local Starport is in
Lancaster, Ca.
If you can help I\'d appreciate it.  For those of you that do have T4
already, do you mind letting me know what it has in common with FFS.  I\'ve
heard it replicates a version of ship and vehicle construction.  Yet, does
it allow construction of other items like
weapons, or other thinks.  Thanks

I had a copy of Dangerous Journeys, along with a number of the supplements
for quite a while...it never got played !

After wading through the first part of the book, trying character generation
etc, you soon realise how complicated it is. It\'s also very detailed. 
What made life worse was the choice of typeface, necessarily small to cram
as much into a single volume as possible I suppose.
The magic system, brushed over in the basic book but available later as a
supplement, (with more pages than the basic rules book !) probably had more
spells than all the AD&D tomes put together.
The system had a lot going for it; intriguing background, Ancient Egypt;
well produced, dedicated magazine
- -- Journeys (imagination failure here I think !); quick appearance of a
number of supplements; loads of depth.

But, ultimately, too complicated for what\'s basically another fantasy RPG.
Good for grabbing ideas from though.

My copy was traded in along with some other stuff before I moved house this
year. Otherwise it would still be gathering dust in the attic !



BTW, anybody thinking of fitting a Cyrix/IBM P+ series CPU to their PC\'s,
make sure you fit a higher throughput fan and bigger heatsink, with plenty
of heat conductive paste. These things run HOT !!!

	You mentioned it. They have a company selling water with some
	mod-cutters for transporting it down. Unlinke the Imperial
	"Mininstery of Colonialisation" who created the Jonkeer\'s
	and tested them in deserts, the Regency "Ministery of the

	Just funny to quote yourself, but after a nigth of thinking
	I got a scenario. A green captain hoping for big bussines
	at Ianic (SM 1924) selling water, unfortuntely its 1083
	and the first Jonkeereer rebellion when the ship arived.
	A ex-prisoner, ex-corsair hired as a chief, and a young
	Medicine school absolvent for steward making the crew.
	A bounty hunter thinks that something is going wrong
	(hey they hired a known corsair) and a *discipline of
	the rigth way* fellower are the first passengers, oh
	not to forget an Ine Givar symatisant who is blind
	passenger and hopes to get to Ianic before the trouble
	starts. And the explosive ferilisers, of cause are
	weapons in reality ;-)

	You see, a short trip through this list makes a scenario.
	I hope to translate them to english next week, to put
	them on my home page.

	Sorry that its not T4. But I neither have T4 rules nor
	one of the starter scenarios some people mentioned here.

	As I have to master a second group on sunday, a T4 scenario
	will still be nice.

Interesting...I was expecting that it wouldn\'t be matchable.  Of course, the
blunder can be salvaged if Imperium Games claims that it was only an example
of a subsector map, here\'s the real one, and replace it with the original 
subsector G in the sourcebook...we\'ll see if they do....  Of course, another
radical option would be to go 3D, but that\'s probably not going to happen,
for many good reasons.

I haven\'t had a chance to look through the Big Black Book much yet, but I have
put together some notes about the era around Dawn from old published sources.
No, I didn\'t say the "C" word.  :)

  * Apparently, sometime between -1776 and -1526, probably closer to -1526 
    than not, a government claiming to be the RoM moved to Sylea (Core 2118).  
    By the end of Twilight in -1526, they no longer are making this claim.
  * The Sylean Federation was founded in -650.
  * According to the MT Referee\'s Companion, they had tech-12 by -150 or so.
    Tech-13 should be widespread by 300; I did see that the Big Black Book
    says Imperial-issue body pistols are already tech-13 at Dawn, so I think
    we can expect Sylea to achieve that tech level well before 300.  These
    dates are known to be very iffy.
  * Twelve Sylean worlds signed the Shudusham Concords in -110.  At that 
    time, Shudusham/Core (Core 2214) was neutral.
  * _Atlas_ apparently defines twenty-five worlds as Sylean Home Worlds,
    which are directly ruled by the Office of the Emperor in the 1100s; all
    are in Core and Kaskii subsectors (G and H, respectively).
  * Cleon\'s campaign started in -30, when he was only 27.
  * At Dawn, when he is elected hereditary emperor for life, he is 57.
    I remember a quote from somewhere that he was President of the Grand
    Senate of the Sylean Federation before that, but can\'t find it.
  * The founding of the Imperium was on January 19, AD 4521, according to
    GDW\'s _Solomani_.  Later MT materials retconned the year to 4518, but
    it appears that the Big Black Book is back to 4521 again.  
  * Cleon II Zhunastu, his son, is not yet born at Dawn.  I guess that
    Cleon was too busy to have children before until then....
  * Artemsus Lentuli, who will become chancellor of the Imperium, and then
    emperor, is 17 years old at Dawn.
  * The Imperial Sunburst has a standard color -- G2V gold on a black field
    -- and is instituted with the calendar and the Imperium.  The star of Sylea 
    is a G2V.  The standard color is abolished in 247.
  * _Atlas_ apparently defines twenty-five worlds as Sylean Home Worlds,
    which are directly ruled by the Office of the Emperor in the 1100s; all
    are in Core and Kaskii subsectors (G and H, respectively).
  * It isn\'t entirely clear just how much territory the Syleans controlled
    at Dawn.  One source claims that they had control of the Core sector;
    another implies that they started with a handful of worlds; a third
    notes that the Imperium\'s reach extended 100 subsectors by Cleon\'s 
    death.  Any could happen, I suppose, but the Imperium must be large
    enough to end ships into the Spinward Marches by 60, and for the
    Pacification Campaigns to make sense.
  * The following megacorporations appear to exist in some form at Dawn:
      Tukera Lines.  It can be assumed that the Tukera family are directly
                     involved with the founding.
      Zirunkarish.   The same can be said for the Shiishuginsa family.
      Ling-Standard. They will found Mora in 60, so they must be big.  They
                     may be involved with the foundation of the industrial
                     complex at Deneb before that.
      GSbAG.         They exist.  Marc Miller\'s article on Luna in Dragon #87
                     indicates that GSbAG may date back to the First 
                     Interstellar War.  No proof that they\'re at the Core in 
                     this time period, but no contrary proof either.
    The other megacorps all have establishment dates known to be later,
    except the three that will join with Vland.  These four give Cleon
    transport, finance, colonial development, and starship construction,
    respectively, if all are at Core and are major.

DGP printed more data in Travellers Digest #9 and #10:

  * Stats for Sylea (TD9)
    7652 km  0.69G  2.2atm  20d32\'5" tilt  24h4m1s day  365d year
    (day/year period seems too convenient, could be argued away if Capital
    is manipulated by Ancients)  Admittedly, Sylea should be a very nice
    world for humans, worthy of being the showpiece of Man in later years.
  * World map for Sylea (TD10)
    Places capital city, Cleon, at about 37 degrees south latitude, in
    clear terrain, on the west coast of the major continent, south of a 
    tropical rain forest.  WBH claims average temperature in the capital 
    is 295K (22 deg. C) with a winter nighttime low of 279K (6 deg. C) and 
    a summer daytime high of 306K (32 deg. C).  Cleon is probably built on 
    a savanna.  The later existance of the Summer Palace on Umgadin/Core may 
    be explained by the tropical summer heat.
  * An illo of the Grand Palace of Cleon is in TD #9.  It\'s a collection
    of pyramidal structures clustered within what appears to be an earthen 
    berm of some sort.  The text suggests that they\'re built as a defensive 
    fortress against possible drop-troop assault.  (From whom?)  It also
    seems to sit on a grassy plain, with hills in the distance, supporting 
    the savanna theory.
  * Cleon established the Sylean Guard regiment as household troops
    at Dawn.  The Marine Escort Force (company-sized) and IISS Imperial 
    Protection Detail (a number of 12-man bodyguard details) were probably 
    also established at this time.
  * Two interstellar governments are mentioned in the issues.  One, the
    "Interstellar Confederacy", is supposedly defunct by Dawn.  The other,
    the Chanestin Kingdom, is centered on Keshi/Dunea (Core 1938) and 
    controlled 25 worlds within 5 pc of Keshi in -107.  Apparently they 
    were still at war with Sylea at Dawn.  [Both could be scrapped at no 
    great loss, since even the old-timers haven\'t heard of them; and 
    maybe they should be.]

Maybe not; LARP is becoming popular for some reason, and has all sorts of

Uh you might want to take a look at the description in T4, page 24.  I quote:
" ... The receipt of membership upon mustering out may be construed as a
reward for heroism or extraordinary service to the Society, rather than an
official benefit of the service."

Silly me, I read this "reward" as coming directly from TAS and not from the
service, just the opposite of you description.  :-)


My question still stands.  Why are the Scout,  of all the military space
services, ignored?  The Marines, Navy both have a chance to be "rewarded" as
do Agents, Entertainers, Rogues and even Nobles (of all people).

whole issue compares very well with that of Imperial time but I won\'t go 
into that again because last time I did on this list I confused even 
myself. 
The way I like to think of it is; there exists an Imperial time against 
which Imperial activity is coordinated, against which hyperspace jumps 
are coordinated, and against which Imperial history is observed and 
recorded. This time is determined universally by reference to movement 
relative to the most distant point/set of points in the universe, that 
way minimising the effects of relativity because every point in the 
Imperium is within a reasonable bound of accuracy to be equidistant from 
the reference point/pattern. In the same way that every point on the 
earth is more or less the same distance from the sun or some distant 
star. Though on individual worlds different time observance may be in 
effect depending on the length of their own days, seasons etc, on those 
worlds that have been contacted by the Imperium, Imperial Time has a 
presence.
In a similar fashion, Imperial Credits (and I am speaking without the 
luxury of reference to what may have been said in T4) have a presence on 
contacted worlds but to varying degrees. I would expect that in order to 
maintain the value of the Imperial credit unit a tight control would be 
kept on its generation. Local worlds would be required to hold reserves 
of Imperial credits in their banking systems and their currencys would 
be traded at exchange rates with reference to Imperial credits and only 
currencys that have been granted special Imperial charters would be able 
to be redeemed for Imperial credits. The Imperial Credit would be like 
the European Monetary Unit to which all European Community currencies 
will eventually be tied. 

I think this subject is worth discussing more.

	The basic rules (which were reprinted as Mythus Prime) were, IMO, 
one of the best written and simplest fantasy systems around.

	this is a fun thing.  I don\'t think it was the font size that 
made it a pain, I think it was that damn stupid fake parchment background 
they used on all the pages.  One of my players was visually impaired, and 
thought we were pulling a joke on him with blank pages...

	The advanced rules were awlful thought, completely overwritten 
and totally contradictory.  For Example:  THere are seperate combat 
systems for: Unarmed NOn-Leathal attacks, Unarmed Lethal Attacks, Armed Lethal 
Attacks, Rnaged Attacks,Spiritual Attacks, Mental Attacks, and Magical 
Attacks (note: Mental and Spriritual Attacks can only be done Magicaly).  
Each of these systems is almost Identical to the others.  Plus there is a 
need to reference a LOT of charts to do anything (all of which can be 
thrown away without losing any flavor).  My favorite part of the combat 
system (75+ pages) was the less than 1/2 a page on healing, which boiled 
down to one rule: Use magic.

	The writing on the basic rules is clean, crisp and Minimal.  The 
writing on the advanced rules is obsfuse and way to wordy (there is a 
seven page essay (in the fine type) on why Social Class  - the only 
completely random thing in character generation - is the most important 
aspect of the charcter. 

> The magic system, brushed over in the basic book but available later as a
> supplement, (with more pages than the basic rules book !) probably had more
> spells than all the AD&D tomes put together.

	Confusing contradictory rules, incoherent writing   :)

	Plus there was a huge chunk of conversion rules for the Horror 
game that was going to be released later (and never was).  I think they 
could have put the real rules for this (Psychic Powers, BTW) into the 
book in the same number of pages (50+ if memory serves).

> The system had a lot going for it; 

	I really liked the basic rules.  I thought that they could have 
been the new major system, but the advanced rules were unplayable...

	The 3 stats I thought were the best thought out part of it.  I 
just wish there was an intermediate level of complexity in the rules 
before you get to the advanced rules 27 (mostly meaninless after char 
gen) stats.

>intriguing background, Ancient Egypt;

	I thought it was a bit much, attempting to fit all the major time 
periods and cultures of the world (plus atlantis, Lemuria, and Mu) into 
one book was just plain overkill (Did I use the word Incoherent yet?).

> well produced, dedicated magazine

It was a nice magazine.  Lots of coverage of all the differnet 
multi-genre games.  Shame that there were only 2 (if I recall correctly) 
Mythus articles not written by Gygax under some psuedonym or another.

> But, ultimately, too complicated for what\'s basically another fantasy RPG.
> Good for grabbing ideas from though.

	I reiterate - the basic rules are a well designed, well thought 
out set of SKILL-based mechanics.  The Task Difficulty system works 
beautiffully (I wish they had used it for the combat system).  Mythus 
Prime is as good as a Fantasy Game you\'ll find on the market.

> My copy was traded in along with some other stuff before I moved house this
> year. Otherwise it would still be gathering dust in the attic !

	That sounds like my copies.


	Of course, I maintain that the basic system was not designed by 
EGG.   It is too well thought out and totally without character 
stereotyping replacing characterization.  There is a very workable Skill 
system and the rules are minimal (Yes, I am only talking about Basic 
Mythus here).  Totally and completely the opposite of the thought 
processes that Gygax has shown over the years.

Let\'s see...

A)	Playing Wizard/Melee on a backpack frame during a Thunderstorm in a
lean-to on Isle Royale (largest island in Lake Superior) during Labor Day
weekend.  GREAT GAME(s) BTW...  Wish someone would revive it...

B)	Playing Trav on the sidewalk waiting in line for the first showing
of "The Empire Strikes Back" the day it premered (a self-declared Senior
Skip Day for some of the participants).  GREAT GAME BTW...  Glad someone
_DID_ revive it...

C)	An all night session of Civilization in a church that catered to
the Gay community in Champaign-Urbana the weekend of the WinterWar
Convention about 10 years ago...  "Yeah, mom. We got down here ok.  We\'re
playing Civ, and staying at the Gay Church.  Bye! <click>"

D)	Squad Leader in a van snowbound on a closed Interstate during a
blizzard (lots of drifting out on the plains...).

I think those are the most unusual.

I apologize for the inaccuracy. However, I will quote from the credits to
the Imperial Encyclopedia, which I have recently gained a copy of:

"Additional Design...........Frank Chadwick,
                             Joe D. Fugate Sr.,  
                             Gary L. Thomas
Editing.....................Gary L. Thomas
                        and Joe D. Fugate Sr."

A friend of mine who owns the Library Data books reports that there are
differences (usually in the form of additions) to much of the data in the
Imperial Encyclopedia.
Also, editors can have quite an impact on a published work.
        It was also pointed out earlier that DGP themselves were
inconsistent about the size of the Sylean Federation.

What was truly offensive about it was the fact that Gygax must have thought we
were all morons or something.  Instead of building with the knowledge of his players
he attempted to reinvent the wheel.

It is pathetically funny to read how he renames \'experience\' \'PC\' (the last ones he
calls \'heroic personaes\'),characteristics etc.  Even if it can be funny for a while, 
it gets boring and then offensive a little while later.  It almost feels like Gygax
wanted to convince TSR that the product he has designed had not been designed while
he had been working for them (according to the intellectual property law, if the 
system had been designed while he was at TSR, there is a reasonnable argument for
TSR to own the rights to the game)

It is like an auto company who would build a car, pretend it is revolutionnary and 
then call it \'HSMV\' (Heavy Self Moving Vehicles) and would then proceed to call the 
wheels LRT (little Round Things).  A driver would become HWP (He Who Pilots), etc.
You get my point.

I don\'t understand why GDW diverted so much energy to another house system while they
were attempting to boost Twiligth and Dark Conspiracy.  It might not have been the
best system in the world, but you don\'t shoot in all directions at the same time.

My recommendation: if you are a collector, get it.  Do not expect to use it ever and
don\'t expect to find it easy reading.

	hm general purpose doesnt mean Int 1, single skill, low data
	robots that we see at tl 8. I would place tl 12 as a margin.
	A low autonomous robots having 5 skills could shurely replace
	a worker (and dosnt ask for money as long as he\'s not self
	aware ;-)

	Thats my idea any tech level increase also increases the
	number of task to sustain this technology by 10. A call
	this diversity increase.

	So at TL 12 you need a population code of 11
	      TL 13                               10
	      TL 14                                9
	      TL 15                                8

	I\'m not talking about overall production capability but
	that increasing tech level increase the diversity of
	technic logarithmical. So this decline of minimum pop
	per tech level would mean that you have 10 robots per
	human at tl 12, 1000 at tl 13, 100000 at tl 14 and
	10000000 at tl 15.

	I think only a puppetier would like the last ;-)

	But there only two way\'s to replace a human, a Tl12-15
	AI-Virus, or a Tl17-19 synaptic AI.

	No. In history every technology offers the posibility to
	to offer work to more people and to feed them. Often new
	techologies where invented when there are no other posibility
	to survive than a new (agricultur) technology. One of
	the most comprehensive book I recently read about this
	subject was "von kanibalen und koenigen, grenzen des
	wachstums antiker hochkulturen" unfortuntely I dont know
	the english title.

	The cycle normaly is :

	- living is easy many childs
	- standart of living (food) drops down to bare survival
	- when new technology is invented continue a level higher

	This book explains very nice why north americans natives
	managed to survie at tl0, south americans figth their
	flower wars and eating each other, indians have holy
	cows they never slauter, china had many dinasties as
	any intruder will become a chinese soon.

	The last capitel about the industrial revolution ended
	with the sentence that "it we try to feed anybody on
	the the world with beef like that produced the US,
	the oil will be empty in 10 years"

	Lets asume US$ at tl7-1995 and Imperial credit at tl15-1100.

        "Handle it?" "Retribution?" -- it was a perfect example of
ROLEPLAYING! The players involved had created consistent personalities for
their characters which were DIFFERENT from their own. Staying consistent
with the characters and the events that had gone before almost REQUIRED that
the PCs get into a fight. I had one experience early on with some munchkin
player who almost wept because a couple of the player characters got into a
fight; that\'s exactly the kind of person I refuse to play with.

        We "handled" it by having a good laugh over beer\'n\'chips in front of
the idiot box later on that night, and one player generating a new
character. No worry about the new character wanting retribution, no hard
feelings, and it wasn\'t a case of the PLAYER trying to get back at the other
player for something. I really miss that gaming group. Half the fun was the
interactions WITHIN the player characters.

        Then there was the time playing "Chamax Plague" when a newbie player
successfully accidentally shot me in the back with a laser carbine ...

        Ummm ... around here a gallon of water weighs 8 pounds ("a pint\'s a
pound the world around"). Unless we\'re talking different gallons. A gallon
of water then equals 3.6 liters (1 kilogram of water weighs 2.2 pounds and
displaces one liter).

I\'m a Mac user and would love a reference CD

In the interest of ease of porting, I suggest HTML format - browsers exist
for all platforms, and the CD could be burned in 9660 format (readable on
Mac/Unix/Windows) for minimal hassle.

Various shareware & freeware utilities for the various platforms could be
included on the CD as well, space permitting.

If you need someone to actually create the pages, I\'d be more than happy to
do that.  Just provide some info, and graphics (if you have any) and I\'ll

When my players came into port, they\'d joke along with 
the cliche (and Douglas Adams) and say "OK, we go 
to a seedy space-ranger bar." 
 
At some point, I turned this into "The Seedy Space- 
Ranger Bar, LIC", a franchise operation that goes for that 
"rowdy spaceport bar" ambiance, hires some out-of-work 
actors to look mean and say "ARRR!!", and such. 
 
Of course, on some worlds it\'s all an act, but on others...

The one that we made goes to the UBC engineer\'s song.

OOOOOOOHHHHHHH!!!!!
I\'M A RAMBLIN\' WRECK

AND A HELL OF AN ENGINEER!

There was a whole song there once but I can\'t remember any more of it.

My GM\'s in Japan till January so there\'s little point in asking him.

In the orbital shipyards of StoneHaven I had a Night Club known as 
"Hanger 15."  This was in TNE and there was an overhead travel lift that 
was infected with Virus.  Someone had hooked up strobes and flashing 
lights the the lift and the whole thing moved back and forth flashing 
lights and such.

  After seeing the phrase above, I had to slap myself to avoid reading

  What I know "kiwi" to mean is that of the phrase "kiwi enema".  A phrase
that meant getting a boot polished with a brand of boot polish strangely
enough called "kiwi", shoved up one\'s rear...

Funny, my characters wouldn\'t be seen in a bar simply because they have 
always meant trouble. Many of our games are played in a bar however. I 
am not sure if that qualifies as a weird place to play, I rather doubt 
it is.
Re; encounters. I can\'t think of the last time an adventure thread was 
picked up in a bar, especially in the games I referee. I prefer to have 
my players contacted at techno raves in abandoned underground chambers 
(bit of a Cyberpunk hangover I\'m afraid). Bar situations seem to proceed 
like this:
"..get that down ya"
"cheers....ah, that one didn\'t touch the sides.."
"hey,check out that chick in the corner...looks a bit suspicious.."
"lets start a brawl..."
"oh ...not again.."
"...what do think you are looking at mate..."
"..see this jimmie.."

There are a lot of things implied by rules simply because it can\'t cover 
everything. The referee really has to decide; What type of world am I 
dealing with given the raw profile I have roled. While the earning of 
Imperial Credits may be important, it is really up to the referee to 
make decisions about the state of the credit rating (in terms of trade 
finance, development finance, and other devices that enable spending 
beyond the colony\'s immediate productive capacity) of the colony, the 
colonies neighbours, and most importantly the colony\'s owners. The rules 
have a very Mercantilist slight to them. I have often said that 
Traveller is very comparable to the days of the great trading and 
adventuring companies in earth\'s history (because of the Frontierthink 
attitudes and the communication time delay) but that shouldn\'t be 
extended to "gold-hoarding" mentality that prevailed then.

Unfortunately the big picture doesn\'t do the small picture any justice 
at all because you end up thinking all the worlds comply with the same 
simple rules - which is basically the problem with working to closely to 
the World Tamers Guide. It is only a guide after all.
Feel free to alter the trade formulas if you think they don\'t make 
sense.

Now you have hit on one of the big failings of Traveller as a 
role-playing game - what, no experience points? 

Ambition? - welcome to the Imperium - if you don\'t have an Imperial 
charter you are little people - keep moving - follow the frontier - 
think Frontier always - live fast, die wide!

if Sternmetal ever finds out about Riseling\'s colony, they will let it run
for a while, and then terminate both him and his experiment if there is a
major publicity problem.
  By the way, the players are looking at setting up a situation similar to
what happened to Bosten during the sunset years of the age of piracy.  The
players are looking to create a starport to handle the needs of battle
scars without asking who produced the scars, or why.  That attitude will
also apply to cargoes.  They hope to set up a low law level, but with a
high law enforcement only with regards to shipping contraband cargoes.
WIth the confiscation they intend to enforce, along with the ability to
sell all arms on the planet - they figure to have it made rather soon.  In
fact, some of the players are thinking about claiming some land on the
colony, and bringing in their own factories from off planet (read that as
imports), and then reap the profits from that...

  Is there anything that I might have missed with regards to how the
Imperium would react to a colony being set up outside legal imperial
borders?  I already intend to plant some "secret agents" from different
organizations.  Heck, one of the players is a member of the Imperial
Security, sort of an FBI organization for the Imperium...

I don\'t doubt it, there is just too much going on in that part of the

I\'m more interested in historical Ianic (since the last Survey) than the next

Don\'t have a lot of the old FASA stuff, so I was not aware of this... 

True...  I guess I based my assumption, that it, like all the other 
Imperial sectors, was also posted by DGP on GEnie, and copied to the 
net...

And I was actually speaking of the portions of Old Expanses 
republished as the RC by GDW

I\'ve been thinking of doing just this, using Illustrator and Photoshop.
(Windows Paint? What the heck is that?) But I\'ve got a thousand other ideas
for my campaign, so it\'s going to have to wait.

It\'s absolutely essential to have lots of floor plans and maps available
when you\'re GMing - I hate having to improvise a Tech-12 Gravliner Port
while the game is in progress. This time out, I\'m going to utterly
prepared; no matter what the situation is, I want to have a map ready for
the job. Fortunately, I dearly love to design weird architectural plans.
It\'s time consuming, though...

In the meantime, do what I do: haunt the Architecture section of your local
library - preferably at a University with an Architecture department. Lots
of plans there; sadly they tend to be reproduced at itsy bitsy scales, but
an enlarging photocopier will deal with that.

For futuristic floor plans, look for the really out-there, visionary,
futurismo designers. I recently copied a *primo* pre-molded
capsule-apartment plan from _Archigram_, a book about the technofreak
plug-in-city designers of the \'60s. 

Paolo Soleri is useless for floor plans, but perfect if you want incredibly
farfetched megastructure cities of an almost Fossian scale - check out his
book _Arcology_ (probably in the Oversized Books section, which happens to
be a good place to look for floor plans; any publisher who is serious about
showing off an architect\'s work is going to go for an oversized format).

In a book on Japanese architecture (forget the name), I found floor plans
for a small floating city, with six decks and a expo/conference facility.
And this thing was actually built! ("Aquapolis" by Kiyonori Kikutake.)
Perfect because it could easily be a space station, or an sub-oceanic
research facility, or whatever. Japanese architecture books are great: as a
society, the Japanese are far more technophilic than us Westerners; they
actually *built* those Archigram tower/geodesics and modular plastic
apartment racks.

Other names to look out for: Dodiaxis, Moishe Safdie (more nifty modular
housing schemes), Antonio Gaudi, and magazines such as _Domus_.

Have fun,

Glenn

ALso great fun was to fill a beer can with sand, and toss _that_ into

How about the local library...?  ;-)

An interesting write up in a newspaper suggested that the Royal 
Geographical Society library (where I worked previously) was a good place 
for women to meet young men.  The kind of dashing young adventurers that 
we had who\'d come to read up on where they were off to.

(Of course we had our fair share of the fuddy-duddy types too!)

Try the local library....  ;-)   - assuming its not a high-tech world


Strangely enough a newspaper reported that the Royal Geographical Society 
Library (where I worked previously) was a good place for ladies to \'run 
into\' dashing young men of the adventuresome bent.  I was never quite 
sure if this was a \'good thing\' or a \'bad thing\'!

Of course, we had our fair share of \'fuddy-duddy\' types too!

You\'re just being contrary here.  In both cases, the government 
didn\'t "draft" people to face these crises.  In the case of the 
Depression, FDR established jobs programs to employ the masses, 
included the largest of all jobs programs, rearmament.  There was not 
a "draft."  The folks involved could have stayed on the dole, and 
lived in Hoovervilles, but given the choice between unemployment and 
working for the TVA, or WPA, most were going to take the latter.

In the case of WW2, essential defense jobs had a tendency to lower 
1\'s draft status, making them more attractive than working for the 
corner market...  It\'s admittedly trivia, but most historians believe 
that WW2 had more to do with pulling the US out of the depression 
than the New Deal...  We drafted people into the military, but nobody 
was jailed because they failed to help make tanks...nobody fled to 
Canada to avoid having to work for Boeing making B-17\'s.

OK, for arguments sake, lets assume that the "real" unemployment rate

You forgot to mention that you are counted as employed if in the 
military, and you aren\'t counted if you\'ve been out of work for a 
year or more...whether you\'re "actively looking" or not...

I will concede the fiction of the unemployment rate...  My main point

By prioritizing things, you are conceding that some things aren\'t 
going to happen immediately, which is my point all along.  Ripple 
effects.  Well, we can only keep half of those South African platinum 
mines going, so half of the industries that use that material have 
higher prices or maybe even no supply at all, lower sales, leading to layoffs...etc...

Actually, it is pretty much a conclusion that the majority of 19th 
century colonies were financial losers for the nations involved, the 
prime exception being India.  Most of the European countries wound up 
investing more money in the colonies than they ever took out...

Probably most of the colonization examples from Earth aren\'t really 
going to work...

Re: real vs. artificial value:

Worth is in the eye of the beholder, and changes over time. 
 200 years ago, no one even knew what oil was...  200 years from now, 
it probably won\'t be used for all that much...other than plastics.

In any case, your flawed argument about real vs. artificial value doesn\'t 
stop inflation, or higher costs of living though.  Ever lived in Alaska?  
I\'ve got a couple of relatives who have...  Yes, the jobs pay well, but the 
cost of living is ridiculous...

Obviously the low tech stuff, but in the early stages, you aren\'t 
going to have the people to produce even all the low tech stuff you 
need.  In the long run, you are absolutely correct.

Who was talking about using a starship to haul stuff point to point.  
If you\'re original colony is near the mine, you won\'t be doing point 
to point hauling...

You are "exporting" the output of the mine.  Otherwise, why did you 
set up a new mining colony in the 1st place?  Maybe later, when the 
colony has developed, then you\'re going to undoubtedly see industry, 
commerce, etc. grow up around the mines...but in the beginning, you 
have the mines, and direct support to the mining and export 
operations...

As far as the orbital shuttle, this would be of course based on the 
assumption that you are operating in widely seperated locations.  In 
a sense there are times when we could both be right...

> And don\'t forget, it makes more sense to "refine" ore on-planet, and

I will concede this point, it would be another strain on local 
technology though, at first...

> metal.

True, but the leap from 1 to the other will be a gradual process.  
Remember, the mining colony was undoubtedly initially established to 
provide raw material to another world, whether in or out of system.  
The economics are going to make them the biggest customer for your 
ingots in the beginning.  Later on, perhaps not...

> So the mines would be on planets that were being colonized for some
> *other* reason. 

Wouldn\'t have to be...  There are only a finite number of resources 
on any 1 world...  If the resources that 1 world are low on happen to 
be in abundance by mining  them on another, you bet they would think 
about establishing a mining colony...  If the industrial world had enough 
resources, why would they bother to establish a colony of any sort?

OK, assume that they\'re mining with high tech means, which is my 
original argument.  In terms of locating it, it would be easier then, 
than it is now.  The same sensor technology that goes into 
densitometers and the like would definitely be useful for locating 
likely deposits...

Most likely though, the final hunting is going to be done on the 
ground...but its not going to take a large group of folks if you\'ve 
narrowed the possibilities from orbit first, and we can already do 
that to some extent, now...

Actually, we\'re splitting hairs here.  This, in essence is what I\'m 
envisioning.  Obviously, if the mine doesn\'t export more that it 
imports in terms of value, it isn\'t going to last long...

And you never refuted my main argument, which is that the un-mining 
colony is not going to be able to produce everything it needs (you 
concede that in your argument).

OK, I can see your train of thought, but making things from metal 
isn\'t high tech.  The Sumerians did that...  The US, which is high tech, seems 
to be letting other countries make things from metal, to a large extent...

Heck...remember slave labor could mean a lot of things.  Entice them 
over to the new planet with the thrill of a job that pays a lot more 
money...then they discover they have to buy from the company store 
that charges 5 times as much...and the bars that charge too much, and 
the housing that the company provides is expensive, and there\'s that 
little clause in the contract that says you can\'t leave until you 
pay off your debts...

And raising cotton in the southern US, and Egypt, and a few other 
places.  Don\'t forget all those guys in the Caribbean growing sugar, 
tea growers in China and India, and several others...

Actually, my feeling is that the Traveller system gets it right.  
Population is only 1 modifier...  Technology doesn\'t really develop 
unless there is a compelling need for it...  In the case of the 
industrial revolution, it was the byproduct of a population boom 
brought on by improving public health systems in Britain, later in 
Continental Europe and North America...  It is quite possible that a 
fairly high population world is going to be relatively low tech, it 
is also quite possible that a low population research station is 
going to be very high tech within its narrow specialization. 

I do think a certain minimum amount of population is going to be 
necessary to achieve high levels of technology in every endeavor.  We 
obviously disagree on what that minimum number is...  So be it...

> What is needed is a certain amount of infrastructure, not some
> specific population.

Infrastructure, of course, is nothing but a fancy, late 20th century, 
new age term for a certain level of economic activity, which would 
support technological achievement, within a chosen field or fields... 
 There are always compelling, economic reasons for technological 
development.  Maybe not for pure research, although this could be 
debated as well, but technology isn\'t pure research.  It\'s applied research, 
based on the discoveries of pure research.

In an interstellar society, remember that the economy is not 1 world, 
but rather a group of worlds.  So the compelling reason for research 
on 1 world may not have originated there...

I\'ve used the libraries, a meeting at a local grav ball tournament,

======Steve Bonneville said:======
* It isn\'t entirely clear just how much territory the Syleans controlled
    at Dawn.  One source claims that they had control of the Core sector;
    another implies that they started with a handful of worlds; a third
    notes that the Imperium\'s reach extended 100 subsectors by Cleon\'s
    death.  Any could happen, I suppose, but the Imperium must be large
    enough to end ships into the Spinward Marches by 60, and for the
    Pacification Campaigns to make sense.
==================================

My interpretation, based on what I\'ve read in the CT Library Data
supplements and Imperial Encyclopedia, is that the Sylean Federation
controlled a handful of worlds around -650 and expanded to control a
sector by about -30.  This was about as big as they could get with the
form of government they had.  Then came Cleon.  He figured on expanding
into new territories but realized that a different form of government
would be necessary.  So, using the fact that one of the RoM governments
had had its seat on Sylea as justification, he declared the 3rd Imp into
existence around year 0 (though I think the "Year 0" thing actually came
afterwards as a retroactive calendar change). Rapid expansion followed.

This is an interesting take on the Lutalan\'s.  I always just thought of 
them as a bunch of ganga smoking anarchistic rastafarians.  Dedicated to 
the ideals of personal freedoms and government with little authority or 
control of the populace.  To this end I thought that they\'d be more like 
a bunch of dope smoking painters wandering in and out of bordello\'s 
writing poetry and trying to understand the nature of the universe.  
Perhaps under that last one there is room for a great deal of religious 
varity and freedom.  

It\'s quite an interesting bent, Southern Baptist Minsters of Lucifer 
preaching on the ways of the Ancients and their amusment park down in 
Okepanokie that everyone should visit and spent lots of money at.

It was always my opinion that if anyone in the RC should have a weird 
almost incomprehnsible guardian spirit kind of religion it would be the 
Spiri.  The kind of society where karma and such were such an integral 
part of their everyday life that others were often confused with what was 
occuring.  Examples from religion and history would be used as often as 
possible, meditation and trance like states to clense the soul would be  
common and the idea of opening your mind to the possibilities around you 
would be paramont.

It\'s early in the morning so perhaps I\'m just rambling.

P.S. I asked this before, but has anyone gotten ideas on using The
Netrunner CCG in traveller?  Maybe I should be asking on a cyberpunk list,
no?

I am planning on hashing something out in this vein with the primary
player involved in the next few weeks, so let me know 1). ideas, and 2).
if anyone else is interested in the results.

and also if anyone wants to know what the heck I\'m talking about.

Actually, I use CT, when I need any rules at all, and am experimenting
with T4.

This was an excercise in fun (and getting carried away), I wouldn\'t use a
random encounter generator, only a "random" NPC (with "random"
personality, i.e. made up on the spot, not rolled on a table) and behave
appropriately (i.e. roleplay).  Getting lucky would depend a lot more on
the judged actions of the characters and their skills/attributes than
anything else.

On the other hand, I had fun going through Greg Porter\'s Macho Women with
Guns (characters have skills like "Shooting Things", "Hitting things with
Other Things", and "Do Technical Stuff") and think the possibilities of
tongue-in-cheek tables (rampant in that work) are great.

Are scouts military?  I\'ve never played them that way.  In fact, my scouts
are aggressively non-military, none of this silly saluting business for them!

As to TAS membership, if scouts are, at this stage in the empire, occupied
with scouting new worlds rather than communicating with explored ones, then
possibly they rarely encounter enopugh members of TAS to have a reasonable
chance of doing a heroic deed - or maybe the spit-n-polish, gleaming-uniform
types steal the credit :-)

I\'ve used the libraries, a meeting at a local grav ball tournament, 
meetings in parks, any number of places.  Let\'s face it the starport 
bar, local tavern, etc where you meet PC\'s is the single BIGGEST

True...a number of the entries were slightly updated with additions.

Not necesarily.  I liked that when I started playing, because experience

My CT solution was to give players skill rolls at the same rate as in
character generation, with the table chosen being based on their activities
during the last four years.

* It isn\'t entirely clear just how much territory the Syleans controlled
    at Dawn.  One source claims that they had control of the Core sector;
    another implies that they started with a handful of worlds; a third
    notes that the Imperium\'s reach extended 100 subsectors by Cleon\'s

==================================

My interpretation, based on what I\'ve read in the CT Library Data
supplements and Imperial Encyclopedia, is that the Sylean Federation
controlled a handful of worlds around -650 and expanded to control a
sector by about -30.  This was about as big as they could get with the
form of government they had.  Then came Cleon.  He figured on expanding
into new territories but realized that a different form of government
would be necessary.  So, using the fact that one of the RoM governments
had had its seat on Sylea as justification, he declared the 3rd Imp into
existence around year 0 (though I think the "Year 0" thing actually came
afterwards as a retroactive calendar change). Rapid expansion followed.

This is an interesting take on the Lutalan\'s.  I always just thought of 
them as a bunch of ganga smoking anarchistic rastafarians.  Dedicated to 
the ideals of personal freedoms and government with little authority or 
control of the populace.  To this end I thought that they\'d be more like 
a bunch of dope smoking painters wandering in and out of bordello\'s 
writing poetry and trying to understand the nature of the universe.  
Perhaps under that last one there is room for a great deal of religious 
varity and freedom.  

It\'s quite an interesting bent, Southern Baptist Minsters of Lucifer 
preaching on the ways of the Ancients and their amusment park down in 
Okepanokie that everyone should visit and spent lots of money at.

It was always my opinion that if anyone in the RC should have a weird 
almost incomprehnsible guardian spirit kind of religion it would be the 
Spiri.  The kind of society where karma and such were such an integral 
part of their everyday life that others were often confused with what was 
occuring.  Examples from religion and history would be used as often as 
possible, meditation and trance like states to clense the soul would be  
common and the idea of opening your mind to the possibilities around you 
would be paramont.

It\'s early in the morning so perhaps I\'m just rambling.

Think about it for a moment:  The system keeps dying, only to be reborn in a
new, better form, striving to overcome its previous faults.  The end goal?
The ultimate Traveller.

It\'s obvious - this is the Buddhist roleplaying game.

You\'re just being contrary here.  In both cases, the government 
didn\'t "draft" people to face these crises.  In the case of the 
Depression, FDR established jobs programs to employ the masses, 
included the largest of all jobs programs, rearmament.  There was not 
a "draft."  The folks involved could have stayed on the dole, and 
lived in Hoovervilles, but given the choice between unemployment and 
working for the TVA, or WPA, most were going to take the latter.

In the case of WW2, essential defense jobs had a tendency to lower 
1\'s draft status, making them more attractive than working for the 
corner market...  It\'s admittedly trivia, but most historians believe 
that WW2 had more to do with pulling the US out of the depression 
than the New Deal...  We drafted people into the military, but nobody 
was jailed because they failed to help make tanks...nobody fled to 
Canada to avoid having to work for Boeing making B-17\'s.

OK, for arguments sake, lets assume that the "real" unemployment rate 
is 15%.  That\'s 39 million to replace 5 billion...  Ain\'t gonna 
happen...

You forgot to mention that you are counted as employed if in the 
military, and you aren\'t counted if you\'ve been out of work for a 
year or more...whether you\'re "actively looking" or not...

I will concede the fiction of the unemployment rate...  My main point 
still stands...

By prioritizing things, you are conceding that some things aren\'t 
going to happen immediately, which is my point all along.  Ripple 
effects.  Well, we can only keep half of those South African platinum 
mines going, so half of the industries that use that material have 
higher prices or maybe even no supply at all, lower sales, leading to layoffs...etc...

Actually, it is pretty much a conclusion that the majority of 19th 
century colonies were financial losers for the nations involved, the 
prime exception being India.  Most of the European countries wound up 
investing more money in the colonies than they ever took out...

Probably most of the colonization examples from Earth aren\'t really 
going to work...

We seem to be a bit arrogant...

Re: real vs. artificial value:

Worth is in the eye of the beholder, and changes over time. 
 200 years ago, no one even knew what oil was...  200 years from now, 
it probably won\'t be used for all that much...other than plastics.

In any case, your flawed argument about real vs. artificial value doesn\'t 
stop inflation, or higher costs of living though.  Ever lived in Alaska?  
I\'ve got a couple of relatives who have...  Yes, the jobs pay well, but the 
cost of living is ridiculous...

Obviously the low tech stuff, but in the early stages, you aren\'t 
going to have the people to produce even all the low tech stuff you 
need.  In the long run, you are absolutely correct.

If you\'re original colony is near the mine, you won\'t be doing point 
to point hauling...

You are "exporting" the output of the mine.  Otherwise, why did you 
set up a new mining colony in the 1st place?  Maybe later, when the 
colony has developed, then you\'re going to undoubtedly see industry, 
commerce, etc. grow up around the mines...but in the beginning, you 
have the mines, and direct support to the mining and export 
operations...

As far as the orbital shuttle, this would be of course based on the 
assumption that you are operating in widely seperated locations.  In 
a sense there are times when we could both be right...

> And don\'t forget, it makes more sense to "refine" ore on-planet, and

I will concede this point, it would be another strain on local 
technology though, at first...

True, but the leap from 1 to the other will be a gradual process.  
Remember, the mining colony was undoubtedly initially established to 
provide raw material to another world, whether in or out of system.  
The economics are going to make them the biggest customer for your 
ingots in the beginning.  Later on, perhaps not...

> So the mines would be on planets that were being colonized for some
> *other* reason. 

Wouldn\'t have to be...  There are only a finite number of resources 
on any 1 world...  If the resources that 1 world are low on happen to 
be in abundance by mining  them on another, you bet they would think 
about establishing a mining colony...  If the industrial world had enough 
resources, why would they bother to establish a colony of any sort?

> And there aren\'t going to *be* mining colonies of that sort. Please

OK, assume that they\'re mining with high tech means, which is my 
original argument.  In terms of locating it, it would be easier then, 
than it is now.  The same sensor technology that goes into 
densitometers and the like would definitely be useful for locating 
likely deposits...

Most likely though, the final hunting is going to be done on the 
ground...but its not going to take a large group of folks if you\'ve 
narrowed the possibilities from orbit first, and we can already do 
that to some extent, now...  

Re: no mining colonies on vacuum worlds:

Change vacuum to exotic atmosphere worlds then...  

I agree with the rest of your points though...

Actually, we\'re splitting hairs here.  This, in essence is what I\'m 
envisioning.  Obviously, if the mine doesn\'t export more that it 
imports in terms of value, it isn\'t going to last long...

And you never refuted my main argument, which is that the un-mining 
colony is not going to be able to produce everything it needs (you 
concede that in your argument).

OK, I can see your train of thought, but making things from metal 
isn\'t high tech.  The Sumerians did that...  The US, which is high tech, seems 
to be letting other countries make things from metal, to a large extent...

Heck...remember slave labor could mean a lot of things.  Entice them 
over to the new planet with the thrill of a job that pays a lot more 
money...then they discover they have to buy from the company store 
that charges 5 times as much...and the bars that charge too much, and 
the housing that the company provides is expensive, and there\'s that 
little clause in the contract that says you can\'t leave until you 
pay off your debts...

Call it indentured servitude, or being Shanghaied if you wish...  I 
don\'t care to bandy semantics...

> That was in a *highly* artifical example. 

True...   We really have 2 different lines of discussion going 
here...

> You don\'t send transportees to inhospitable worlds unless you have

OK...we\'re in agreement here...

And raising cotton in the southern US, and Egypt, and a few other 
places.  Don\'t forget all those guys in the Caribbean growing sugar, 
tea growers in China and India, and several others...

Actually, my feeling is that the Traveller system gets it right.  
Population is only 1 modifier...  Technology doesn\'t really develop 
unless there is a compelling need for it...  In the case of the 
industrial revolution, it was the byproduct of a population boom 
brought on by improving public health systems in Britain, later in 
Continental Europe and North America...  It is quite possible that a 
fairly high population world is going to be relatively low tech, it 
is also quite possible that a low population research station is 
going to be very high tech within its narrow specialization. 

I do think a certain minimum amount of population is going to be 
necessary to achieve high levels of technology in every endeavor.  We 
obviously disagree on what that minimum number is...  So be it...

> What is needed is a certain amount of infrastructure, not some
> specific population.

Infrastructure, of course, is nothing but a fancy, late 20th century, 
new age term for a certain level of economic activity, which would 
support technological achievement, within a chosen field or fields... 
 There are always compelling, economic reasons for technological 
development.  Maybe not for pure research, although this could be 
debated as well, but technology isn\'t pure research.  It\'s applied research, 
based on the discoveries of pure research.

In an interstellar society, remember that the economy is not 1 world, 
but rather a group of worlds.  So the compelling reason for research 
on 1 world may not have originated there...

In one of our first sessions of RPG (it was D&D, more than ten years

One of the players had two characters - a thief and a fighter. The

fighter.

The thief failed his skill-roles and ... yes ... got killed by the

Been there, done that. In a Shadowrun game I was in, we stormed a

"Unless we\'re talking different gallons."
An Imperial gallon (British Empire) is still used in the UK and in 
some of Europe. In Imperial measure 8 pints make a gallon. A gallon 
is approx 4.5 litres. So a gallon weighs almost 10 lbs.

Today\'s issue of New Scientist has an interesting article which

ring of superconducting ceramic spinning at 5000 rpm. The expert 
commentators suggest that the effect may have something to do with 
gravitomagnetism, but from reading this article it would appear 
nobody can really explain it.
Because of this, and because of the withdrawal of the paper relating

This makes a good thread for everyone to chime into:

BTW, with TNE and T4, characters don\'t die during generation. I\'d change it to 
"Character gets injured during generation."

Player makes a Monty Python or Star Wars reference during game: one drink
Character starts bar fight: four drinks.

In my RC game, there was a chain of bars, called (name of world/port/town) Joe\'s. This 
chain was started back in the days of the Imperial Civil War (Barracks Emperor era, 7th 
Century IE) as a franchise, which grew like a wild weed. 

In the New Era, Joe\'s are the seediest, sleaziest, most low-life taverns this side of 
the Mos Eisley(sp) Cantina(tm), which they resemble in most respects. On some worlds, 
Joe\'s is the _only_ tavern. It\'s a place made for rumor-mongering, heavy drinking, and, 
of course, bar fights.

	To quote GDW :

	" Deneb 1324 Jonkeer : The inhabitants of the world, the
	  Jonkeereen are geneered humans, created by Imperial
	  Ministery of colonialisation of desert environments.

	  Jonkereen are tall, thin and dark skinned, with protective
	  membrans shielding thier eys and ears. More important than
	  these cosmetic differences are sophisticated changes to
	  their metabolism that allow them to survive in the temperatur
	  extremes of the dry desert environment"

	To make it short Jonkeereen survive at atmos >= 3 and hydro + 0.
	Experiments with Jonkeereen on worlds with atmos = 2 died with
	the release of virus.

	I dont know why these worlds (containing Jonkeer) are not declared
	Amber. Imho it was forbidden to trade anything with Tl>5 to a

	Never heard about TNE ? The Regency are the surviving "keepers

	was proclaimed at 1132.

You may indeed be talking different gallons. There\'s the U.S. Customary
Gallon, at 231 cubic inches, and the British Imperial Gallon, at 277.42
cubic inches. Hence the confusion, perhaps.

The Table of Conversion in my Houghton Mifflin says 1 gallon = 4.546
litres. But it doesn\'t specify which "gallon" it\'s referring to.

SNIPOLA

Actually, Lexis-Nexis only provides limited information.  This direct 
from the weasel\'s mouth:

(http://www.lexis-nexis.com/lncc/p-trak/p-trak.html)

"Incorrect information is being distributed on Internet newsgroups
regarding the data displayed in LEXIS-NEXIS\' P-TRAK file. P-TRAK is
like an electronic "white pages." The only information displayed is
the name of the individual, current address and up to two previous
addresses and telephone number. In some cases, the individual\'s maiden
name may appear and as well as the month and year of birth. That is
the ONLY information displayed in the P-TRAK file.

Contrary to some messages that have been posted to some Internet
discussion and news groups, the P-TRAK file does not contain any
credit histories, bank account information, personal financial data,
mother\'s maiden name or medical histories. This misinformation has
been posted over and over again to various news groups. An example of
a record appears below:

Name:  DOE, JOHN  E
Current Address:  1066 Anywhere Drive, Dayton, OH   95454
Previous Addresses:  106 Somewhere Drive
                        Dayton, OH 92454
Birthdate:  9/1965
Telephone number:  555-1212
On file since:  6/1/1994"

	They go on to mealy-mouth about only \'highly professional users\' 
like lawyers, cops, pi\'s and skiptracers get to see this data.

	Without going into a flamewar over that one,  You would have to 
wonder at the original post.  People are willing to believe that a 
company would open itself up by providing ALL the information needed 
to commit credit fraud to anyone dialing in.  I don\'t know about you 
or me, but Mastercard, Visa and American Express have lawyers that 
would hop on that like nobodies business; it opens them up to 
billions in lost revenue and losses.

	It\'s fun watching how fast Urban Legends get spread these days...

	Still, I\'m getting my name taken off of it...

 No, No, No!  J4J would be playing MT and trying to convince us

Much as I hate to say this, but it almost sounds like you have a brother
named Chekov who constantly stated that <insert item here> was invented in
Russia, or that <insert quote here> was coined in Russia, or that <insert
famous inventor> was born in Russia.  Of course, this could be something
that happens in Scotland as well, for was it not the famous Engineer
Scotty who once said "fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on

 The name is "Iqigo". With the cute tilde over the n. But you\'ll probably 
see a strange character instead of the q.

 Try it with your browser:

 I&ntilde;igo

Same here.  This is nothing other than good old fashioned DOGMATISM rearing 
its ugly head.  Dogmatism (whether religious, political, cultural, etc.) tends 
to foster cynicism, eliminate proactivity,  stifle creativity, silence the 
voices of less bold individuals, and spoil things.  Let\'s not sink to that 
level.

  8 lbs is an approximation.

1 US gallon = 3.8l 
1 CDN gallon = 4.55l

1 US gallon = 3.8x2.2 = 8.36 lbs 
1 CDN gallon = 4.55x2.2 = 10 lbs

  I used to think a US gallon was 4 liters, but the back of one of my
  texts in college had the actual values.

Thanks Paul. Pleasure to be able to join you. I feel I\'ve been blind and 
can finally see. You may find some of my thoughts on Traveller reflect 
the games development in relative isolation.

I notice there are a few Australians on the list so I won\'t mention 
Cricket.

Kiwi is a common term used for the people of New Zealand of all races 
and place of origin since New Zealand is basically a nation of 
immigrants. The term comes from a native bird called a Kiwi by the NZ 
Maori people. An image of the Kiwi appears on the Australian boot polish 
called Kiwi boot polish that appeared before WW1 (I think). I also 
understand the New Zealand Kiwifruit Marketing Board chose the name 
Kiwifruit for what is traditionally known in NZ as a Chinese Goosberry 
in order to market the fruit in places like the United States. Most 
Americans probably think of a little hairy fruit when they hear the word 
Kiwi. 
Strangely enough in the Vlaahurg tongue the word Kiwi is the most 
vicious of insults imaginable and has been the cause of more horrible 
and bloody interstellar wars than anything else in the history of 
creation.

That sounds like a fine idea. Take your point about experience

Of course, that makes for a lot of ongoing material for a referee to

My players are like the people of Cloud City, "..they have no love for 
the Empire, I can tell you that."  Me, on the other hand, I love the 
Imperium (I used to always play the German in the Colditz boardgame 
too).

I heard on the radio today that this is a hoax (it seemed to be one to me
when I first ran across this).  According to the report that I heard Lexis
never contained much of the information listed.  Apparently at one time it
_did_ have the Soc Sec Number but it has since been removed.

Gary Gygax himself designed the system. I was there (for part of it,

An early reviewer of Traveller said that in Traveller, you gained

Traveller gear-heads.  It\'s called "The Millennial Project:  Colonizing the
Galaxy in Eight Easy Step", by Marshall T. Savage.

The Introduction is by Arthur C. Clarke.  A quote from the introduction on
the cover reads, "I am completely awed, and I don\'t awe easy, by the
author\'s command of a dozen engineering disciplines..."

The project includes mass drivers built inside mountains for space launch
(assisted by laser boost), and floating cites to provide power and capital.
 I just read a good description of a tailored vacc suit.

It has an extensive bibliography and footnotes.

So far it looks a like a good reference for those who like science in there
SF games.

Try "Teach Yourself Web Publishing With HTML 3.2 In 14 Days" by Laura Lemay
from sams.net publishing (www.mcp.com/samsnet/books/tyhtml).  Yes, it does
include *one* chapter on describing the WWW, but most HTML books do.  It
also covers setting up a server, frames, CGI, Java, Javascript, plug-ins,
ActiveX, etc.  It\'s also really BIG and useful and useful in self defense
:-)

You can try using some advanced books but if your only experience with HTML
is cutting and pasting from other pages, they might be too advanced (?).

Try "HTML Reference Library" at http://subnet.virtual-pc.com/~le387818/.
It\'s not really an "on-line" reference... more of a Help file for Win \'95.

Macintosh System 7:  You get in the car to go to the

UNIX:  You get in the car and type GREP STORE.  After
reaching speeds of 200 miles per hour en route, you
arrive at the barber shop.

Windows NT:  You get in the car and write a letter
that says, "go to the store."  Then you get out of
the car and mail the letter to your dashboard.

Taligent/Pink:  You walk to the store with Ricardo

OS/2:  After fueling up with 6000 gallons of gas,
you get in the car and drive to the store with a
motorcycle escort and a marching band in procession.
Halfway there, the car blows up, killing everybody
in town.

S/36 SSP [mainframe, obv.]:  You get in the car and

To put it succinctly he shows that A great amount of gravity can be created

That is true. We here in "God\'s Own" do tend to refer to ourselves as
Kiwi\'s (after our small flightless native bird). Our small country here in
the South West Pacific gained some fame by our NO NUCLEAR stand toward the
Americans and French and for our ALL BLACK Rugby team (the best in the
world!!!)

BTW, New Zealand is the country, the Maori discovered the land before the
Eurpoeans (but tend not to refer to them as natives), and we generally
allow any NZ citizen to call themselves a Kiwi.

Well, this is off topic for the TML, but hey, it\'s my moment to shine
before retiring and resume lurking....

And I\'m speaking up for the OS/2 people.  <g> We can read all your DOS/Win
stuff already so we don\'t say much.  I\'m in favor of
something generic that we all can use.  Let\'s not leave any of us out.

HTML and the Acrobat formata are available across most platforms out here. 
Acrobat has a number of advantages, but the readers are large and the price
of the software to create the documents is kind of high.  HTML isn\'t as
flexible and the browsers we\'d use to read it aren\'t all that hot yet, but
it\'s essentually free both to create and to read.

Ok, let\'s clear this up!

2 gills  =  1 pint   =  28.875 c"  =  0.4732 liters
2 pints  =  1 quart  =  57.75  c"  =  0.9463 liters
4 quarts =  1 gallon = 231.0   c"  =  3.7853 liters

1 British Imperial gallon = 277.42 c" = 4.546 liters

1 liter of water = 1 kilogram = 2.2046 pounds

So...1 gallon of water weighs 8.35 lb, and 1 Imperial gallon of
water weighs 10.02 lb.

  I just finished setting up the basic parameters for my gaming group to
build a viable colony.  I have been using the WORLD TAMERS HANDBOOK and
came across and interesting anomalty...

  The PC\'s were granted the use of 750 million Credits towards their
colony purchases.  The world they are coming from is a Tech 13 world.
They have access to a Colonizer class transport carrying 24,200 or so low
berth passengers, along with quite a bit of tonnage for the cargo hold
(ship has yet to be built - if not possible, then two or more will be
built).  Each "colonist" was granted 3,000 credits towards the equipment
needed for the colony. 
  What the PC\'s intend to do is set up equipment that is roughly tech 10
and build up the economy with the Tech 10 stuff.  This will only employ a
specific percentage of population (a small one to be sure).  The remainder
will be sent to the outback and colonize at tech level 3 (since this tech
needs little or no capital to set up).  Essentially, this planet will be a
tech level 10/3 world.  If one assumes that 80% of the pop is at tech 3,
while the other 20% is at tech 10, how would you go about handling it in
the trade classification?  How would you handle the trader that shows up
in port with Tech level 3 equipment and stuff?  After all, 80% of the
colony wants what it can get it\'s hands on.  On the other hand, if this
colony devotes it\'s entire tech 10 output towards exports, how would the
recieving world handle the trade classification?  More importantly, it
might be possible to have a tech classification that is considered to be
"colonial" which takes anything at par, regardless of the tech level of
the manufacturing planet.  Myself, I intend to handle it as a split level
and trade as would be done were "I" really there on the colony.  This
means that all cargos from tech 3+ will be dealt with on the colony as if
it were a population rating of 4.  Tech level 10+ stuff will be treated as
a population 3 world (5,000 people at tech 10, with 20,000 at tech 3).
Ultimately, the colony advisors (PC\'s) will bring the world up to tech
level 10 standards...

Any comments?  Just wondered if this would be considered a waste of
bandwidth, or if people are interested in the contrast that a colony world
presents.  Imagine: a world were the city folk use contra-grav vehicles
and modern science while in the outback, people are using animal
transportation as well as animal farm equipment (ie plow animals, cart
animals, etc).  A man could ride up a ceramic paved road with a horse
wearing rubber horseshoes.  Piles of horse manure dot the roads as high
velocity grav vehicles race overhead.  Classrooms away from the city tune
into the broadcast lectures presented by the teachers in the city courtesy
of the satelites overhead.  As time goes on, rancher kids head into the
city to get better paying jobs at the factories, or to learn how to use
the high tech food production equipment, and maybe buy some for the home
ranch.
  In the meantime, this planet still has problems with discovering new and
dangerous things.  As time goes on, people begin to see "new" and
"dangerous" as being synonomous with each other...

Damn I like the picture this presents!  It\'s almost Heinleinish!!!

Come to think of it, "Methusalah\'s Children" could be those who have been
genetically "genered" to naturally producing the effect of Anagathics and
Lazurus Long (a character from Heinlein\'s TIME ENOUGH FOR LOVE,
METHUSALAH\'S CHILDREN, THE CAT WHO COULD WALK THROUGH WALLS, and so on)
could really exist!

Hot diggity!

Living in an SCA household made D&D GMing *much* easier. When some
clueless player said "we\'re marching down the 10 foot corridor 5
abreast" I was able to grab him and some others, stick them in the 10
foot wide archway between the living room and dining room, then hand
them each a sword and shield. Then I asked them to *try* to swing the
swords (rattan tourney swords, I didn\'t want any dead players).

After bashing each other for a while they got the point. 

Ditto for the idiot who wanted to haul a 15 foot pole arm around in the
dungeon. 

BTW, as for the difference between what a player knows and what a
character knows, while it can be fun, I advise *against* running a game
where the characters are "themselves". There are lots of ways to set it
up, but the usual result is that the ref finds out his players are
experts at the *strangest* things, and often can use this against him.

Be glad you don\'t game with me. Underworld folks are *not* stupid. They
*will* have someone who knows about the deal, but who won\'t be around
for you to whack. 

Assuming that they don\'t get suspicious when the go-between gets it in
3, or when another guy gets it in 4, they\'ll know for *certain* after
5. This means that you\'ll be on a better dead list, and depending on
their connections, it may be a very widespread list.

And if you turn pirate, that means you\'ll *have* to deal with the Guild
or whatever sort of organization(s) are behind the scenes in
interstellar crime. And if they\'ve heard about this little incident,
your trust rating will be negative. Which makes for a *real* short
career.

I spent about six months living with an ex-con as a roomie. Pros don\'t
*like* people who are unpredictable, it makes them nervous. They
*really* dislike folks who pull the sort of double-cross you describe
above. 

Whacking the bodyguards? No problem. Killing the folks you made the
deal with. *Big* problem.

ps. while the ex-con hadn\'t been convicted of anything violent, he had
lots of stories about folks who had been. I\'ve found his stories
*quite* useful when dealing with "criminals" as a player and as a ref.

Probably won\'t work right. There have been debates about this sort of
thing for over 50 years, and we won\'t *know* until we get a large
enough "shirt sleeve" environment on the moon.

A standing *high* jump is the one jump everybody agrees on. And what
they agree is that the distance you raise the *center of mass* is the
critical figure. 

So trying to grab that ledge with your finger tips works like this. If
in 1 g you can jump high enough to touch an 8 foot ledge, that *doesn\'t
mean that you can jump high enough to touch a 48 foot ledge in 1/6th g.

Instead: you are 6 feet tall. Your arms reach 18 inches above that. So
all you *really* jumped was 6 inches. Time 6 for 1/6th g gives 36
inches. Add 7\'6" to that and you get 10\'6". So you can grab a ledge at
10\'6" at 1/6th g as easily as an 8\' one at one g. 

Jumping *over* something (or up onto something) it\'s how high your feet
go. And that\'s a combo of the center of mass change and how far up you
can pull your feet. 

Standing *broad* jump *probably* depend on velocity, so it lumps in
with runing jumps.

> The same PC can do a running jump of 5m under 1G, 50m under 0.1G, 25m under
> 0.5, 2.5m under 2G, and 1.75m under 3G. Any such jump is going to require a
> task roll against an applicable skill.

Broad jumps depend on the takeoff velocity and angle. Period. Assuming
the angle is the same, and that you can get up to the same velocity
(more on that below) then the distance goes like this with the gravity
change. You have a horizontal and vertical velocity.  The vertical
velocity determines how long between when you leave the ground and when
you land again, as well as how high you get. The horizontal velocity
*multiplied by* the time in the air is how far you move horizontally.

So, vertical velocity divided by acceleration equals the time to peak
of trajectory. Double it to give the total time in air. Horizontal
velocity times this time is your distance.

Now for the gotchas. First, for a broad jump, the minimum takeoff angle
is governed by your ability to swivel your body from launching to
landing position *without* bashing your feet into the ground. Since
lower gravity gives more time in the air, you have more time for this,
and may be able to get by with a shallower launch angle. This changes
the split of your starting velocity between horizontal and vertical.
Higher gravity works in the opposite direction. And the relation isn\'t
linear. 

Worse, at very low gravities you get to throw most of this out the
window as you are noving at a sufficiently high fraction of orbital
velocity that you can\'t treat the path as a parabola. At a certain
(low) gravity, the height you can jump becomes infinite. That is, your
vertical velocity from the jump exceeds escape velocity. And long
before that the heights start getting really ridiculous.

And if you can run fast enough, you\'ll go into at least partial orbit. 

For vertical jumps at really low g, figure the *velocity* required to
jump that high at one g. Next figure escape velocity for the body you
are on. Subtract your jump velocity from that, and then figure at what
altitude that velocity matches escape velocity. That\'s how high you\'ll
go. 

Running is going to be affected by differing gravities in weird ways.
There are equally plausible arguments for running speed *increasing*
with gravity (pendulumn effect) and *descreasing* (other effects). We
really don\'t know. Maybe some of the sports medicine types have learned
enough about how the body moves to get some better data. 

Then there\'s traction. At high gee you have *lots* of traction, at low
gee you have very little.

The yacht *might* be some sort of reward. So it might be paid for.

And the lab ship is likely to be paid for, simply because any career
that gets one is likely to be the sort of thing where some "scientific"
group figured that it was worth it to provide you with a ship. Consider
Jacques Cousteau and the Calypso. He "bought" and refitted the ship ( a
surplus WWII minesweeper!) mostly through a lot of hard work and
convincing research groups to fund him.

Well, I\'d like to request that once Marc gets "hand generated" sectors
to replace the messed up ones, that he plan on *never* changing the
stellar locations again (except possibly for the sort of drif you are
talking about. Ditto for stellar type. Only changes should be over

This will make the stuff that is *easily* detectable from a distance a
"known constant" and keep the heartburn among refs trying to work
around official releases down to a mamageable level.

It\'s a lot easier to tie new system data to an existing map position
than it is to re-arranging xboat routes and the like.

Ever hear the definition of "coyote ugly"? That\'s when you wake up next
to someone and you\'d rather gnaw off your arm than risk waking them up
by tryingh to get it out from under them. ("coyote" reference is to
their escaping from traps by gnawing off foor caught in trap).

Sounds like it might fit a 14 result. :-)

ps. I just had a vision of a human using the phrase, then having to
explain it to his (now slightly irritated at the possible slur) Vargr
companion. I figure the Vargr will react one of three ways:

1. thinks it\'s hilarious
2. gets the reference but doesn\'t understand why it\'s funny
3. "humans are *weird*" reaction

Hey, check out book 5 of the Mageworlds series "The long Hunt" by Debra
Doyle & James McDonald. Our heroes decide to go sight seeing, and after
buying some trinkets, they want some refreshments. Just to keep up his
rep for culture, one insists on a tea & pastries shop. 

I won\'t spoil it for you by detailing what happens next.

And as my message pointed out, it\'s possible for fairly low tech
societies to conserve and recycle water. Roman level tech could even do
a decent job, given some tips.

Nope. It takes a *lot* of work to compress gases to the (rather high)
density of water. Add in the weight of the tanks, and liquid wins. 

If I was hauling large amounts of water (whether for drinking or just
as a convenient way to haul hydrogen and oxygen), I\'d build a
specialized ship. Build it like an asteroid hull, but out of *ice*. Use
a "netting" type hull grid like one of the *old* cargo tug designs in
CT. 

If you can find a copy, "Gallagher\'s Glacier" gives a good description
of a ship like this. Except here the owner is operating it as a
freighter! 

Sure, the equipment slowly melts it\'s way thru the ice towards the
"down" side of the ship (Gallagher used spin gravity, so it migrated
towards the outside). This is from "pressure melting" of the ice.  This
means every time it gets inconvient enough, you melt away the floor
until the equipment is conveniently accessible again. Pump the melt
water to the outside of the hull in an appropriate place and let it
refreeze. 

Sure, the configuration of rooms isn\'t fixed. But that can be a plus.
Gallagher smuggled a lot of stuff without the customs men realizing
that he could have cargo holds that weren\'t connected to anything. When
he needed to get to them, he\'d melt a new tunnel.

While such a ship isn\'t going to like more than a g or so of
uncompensated acceleration, It\'s going to handle some types of attack
*very* well. For example, lasers and particle beams are practically
useless. Furst they have to raise the ice to melting temp. Then they
have to melt it. Then they have to raise it to boiling, then they have
to boil it. Each step takes a remarkable anout of energy.

Also, since you would have *designed* the thing with fuel purifiers,
the entire ship is "fuel". 

Regardless, the concept is quite workable, if a bit odd. Build it into
a *big* chunk of ice, fly the ice to market, calve off as much as you
want to sell, head back out and find more ice, which you cam "weld"
onto the ship easily.

Repeat as needed. If you need to hide out for a while, burrow the
hardware into a *big* ice chunk. You may not be able to jump, but you
can still use your manuever drive, so what if it\'s only 1/1000 of a g?
How long will it take the bad guys to blast through a few km of ice if
they happen to notice you? :-)

Hmmm. I just had a thought. If the bad guys do spot you, rig missile
warheads as an Orion drive setup. You get a boost away from the
baddies, they eat hot plasma. :-)

Meat. Though I *do* have to mention that even Earth\'s moon is far
*smoother* than a billiard ball (check the diameter against the highest
and lowest points if you don\'t believe ne)

Frankly, I think blasting the surface into house sized chunks for a
depth of a km or so would be a good start. Then blast the top layers of
that into smaller chunks, and the top layers on that into even smaller
ones. Repeat until the smallest size is gravel, and the gravel has been
"shaken down" to fill the gaps between the bigger pieces (but still
leaving a solid layer of gravel on top.

This has several advantages. First, it makes the thermal and acoustic
conductivity of the surface damn close to *nil*. So no IR pinpointing.
And shock waves from surface impacts will damp out fast. 

It also has interesting effects with regards to other sensors and other
attack methods.

I can see the sensor ops now.

"Sir, sensors report target has launched multiple thousands, repeat,

1 liter of water = 1 kg (original definition of kg!)
1 kiloliter (aka 1 cubic meter) of water = 1 metric ton).

The unit definitions have changed over the years, but 1000 liters = 1
metric ton is *still* correct to within less than 1% error. 

Also, the US gallon is *defined* as 231 cubic inches. That\'s 3785 cc
per gal. That gives 264 gallons per kiloliter. 

Also, at 3785 cc per gal, that gives 3785 grams per gallon (or 3.8 kg
per gal). Divide by 28.35 grams per ounce (another defined relation)
gives about 134 ounces, divide by 16 ounces per pound gives 8.3 pounds
per gallon.

Looks like your pounds per gallon figure was hosed.

But as you can see, it really pays to keep the fact that the metric
system is *based* on water in mind.

There *is* an alternate source. It\'s called "conservation". All they
neede is enough water to make up for the losses in their recycling. And
when you consider that the basic animal energy equation (carbohydrates
+ oxygen yields water + carbon dioxide + energy) produces *large*
amounts of water, they get a bonus there from every single visitor.

Recycling water is *easy*. And given the massive shortage, the way they
likely do it is that *all* "waste liquid" from whatever source is
collected and recycled. Also, major efforts will be taken to not
contaminate water. Polluting a water supply will be a capital offense.
*That* will encourage industry to clean up their act. They\'ll also use
processes that either keep the water in a closed loop, or that use
little or no water.

Read Dune (the book!). It\'ll give you some ideas. 

Agriculture will not be out in the open. And livestock will tend to be
smaller animals as well as water efficent animals. For example, sheep,
goats and rabbits rather than cattle and pigs. Greenhouses will be used
for growing plants, so that you won\'t lose the water that evaporates. 

Solar stills will recover a lot of water from various wastes. Wind
traps amd other tricks can recover significant amounts of water from
"dry" air. 

Dwellings will be constructed to minimize water loss. This is possible
at quite low tech levels once you know how. For instance,
counter-current heat exchangers can be modified to not only manage heat
transfer, but also *moisture* transfer. Our noses do this...

You can do it with something as simple as narrow, convoluted passages
limed with moisture absorbent material.

Also, low hydrographics is not the same as lacking water. It just means
that there isn\'t much *surface* water. 

The planet could be one big sand dune, but with a massive water table
100 or so meters down.

You know where the Ine Givar base is? You don\'t really want that Ine Givar
leader? Drop a few tons of ceramic Smartpellets onto the area from orbit
and you have one collapsed base and a lot of hamburger. Who needs
Marines?

How badly do you want to teach these guerillas/bandits an "object lesson"?
If they have nothing that you really want, and are upsetting the things
that you *do* want, well, just dump a load of ceramic smartrubble on the
several square kays that they are passing through (from orbit, of course).
Everything - and I mean *everything* - in the region affected no longer
exists! Do this a few times and there aren\'t any more guerillas/bandits.
Do you care if the (few) survivors hate your guts as long as they do
nothing about it? Why would the imperium care if these sorts of actions
got the results they wanted?

Of course, this assumes that the locals have enough tech to even suspect
how the invaders tech works. Why would a Croat or Serb or Bosnian peasant
who probably never got more than an Elementary School education and for
whom the most complicated piece of tech he knows anything about is his
AK-47 clone know anything about Fusion power systems? How would he even
have a clue as to how to jigger the input lines so as to introduce O2 into
the tanks?

It depends on what you\'re fighting over and how bad you want to win.
Actually, I suspect that I\'m the guy Darryl was commenting about in his
initial remarks. Let\'s look at the problem of resisting a high tech
attacker again --

Say I\'m a TL15 Marine Officer and I have a mission to take and hold a
particular planet and certain installations and cities on its surface
(and, probably, above it - if it\'s of a high enough TL). The Planetary
Army (and any armed civilians) are, understandably, not enamoured of these
ideas and decide to resisrt. Say that they are TL7.

OK. What do I do? Well, first of all, I check my intelligence and
determine the site of all major (and minor) military bases through
intelligence assets - humint or techint ... and the latter is going to be
so sophisticated that the defenders probably won\'t even know its being
done. Then, well, I *have* space superiority (maybe they can put up a few
Shuttle equivalents with chemical rockets, and a few Killersats with nukes
or primitive lasers ... but I brush them aside with my TL/15 Close Escorts
or Destrotyers).

So, what can I do -- well, under Striker (or Striker II), Mercenary, or
any iteration of Traveller, I have to go in and refight WW2 with tanks and
APCs. Sure, they have fusion weapons and tacnuke missiles, but it *still*
leaves open the *remote* possibility that I might take casualties from a
sufficiently ingenious enemy ... probably more by bad luck than anything
else. But why should I have to?

The defenders *have* to mass their forces, because of their relatively
shitty tech, in order to mass the firepower to have any chance of
resistance. Great! From orbit, a couple of bundles of smart "crowbars" ...
aerodynamically shaped chunks of ceramics or, perhaps, even steel or
tungsten ... are targetted against point targets as small as enemy
armoured vehicles, trucks, heavy weapon and artillery positions, not to
mention the pitiful ICBM equivalents that could be retargeted (in theory)
against my spacecraft. Within minutes a time on target bombardment
destroys them all ... the enemy has no ECM that can degrade my sensors
and, if I choose, I can use TL14 (or even TL13, even TL12) "mature"
technology to ensure reliability rather than relatively "unreliable" but
"cutting edge" TL15 tech. He probably doesn\'t even have any warning. To
take care of the troops, well, equally "smart" clouds of ceramic "rubble"
are targetted against their deployment areas and, to put it bluntly,
pulverise everything within their area of effect down to several meters.
No-one and nothing within these areas survive.

Having destroyed all the *regular* forces, I *could* move in and -
perhaps, barely - take losses from enraged civilians. OK, so what do I do
then? Well, I take out certain key power distribution nodes (not the
generators, just the transmission lines and the like) and leave all the
major towns and cities in the dark. Transport choke points such as
bridges, mountain passes, highway overpasses and the like are also
destroyed or "neutralised". All this could well happen simultaneously with
the initial strike. This would be a *major* inconvenience for the
defenders civilians - do they really want to starve and freeze/swelter in
the dark? I could ensure that they do without ever setting foot on the
planetary surface!

At this point, I simply demand their surrender. What can they do to
resist? Damn all.

Do I need to garrison the planetary surface? Nope. Simply designate a
government down there to be in charge and let *them* do my dirty work. If
things get too dicey for them to control, further salutary measures
against the civilian population can be taken as needed - all causing
minimal *direct* casualties - but threatening to blow them back to the
stone age if they don\'t co-operate.

And this assumes that there is something down there that I *really* need.
If there isn\'t, well, all bets are off!

Actually, the guy in Battle Dress would kill hundreds, if not thousands,
with available ammo and then simply retreat, using the Grav Belt built
into his augmented BD! He could keep doing this again and again as long as
ammo resupply could be arranged. The guys with the spears simply couldn\'t
touch him. Sure, he\'d be one tired bugger by the time he\'d killed them all
(assuming they didn\'t break and run first - which they would), but, with
even minimal sense (and a lot of ammo) there\'s nothing they could do!

And against *intelligent* and *ruthless* high techs, theres damn all the

But the high tech Marines don\'t *need* to take on the low techs in any way
that requires them to take casualties.

The other option is to do it as JAVA/HTML , so it is hardware independant 
(except for the CDrom)

I have heard some reviews from T$R\'s attempt. It sucked the big one. No 
hypertext at all, just some one typing out the rules into a wp program.

If JAVA/Opendoc/HTML is used (Since Jo is working at Lotus, she will be 
up to date on the stuff that Big Blue / Lotus / Apple are churning out in 
this reguard), we can have a full blown product that is fully hypertexted 
(all relevent terms hyperlinked, ie you press a planet name and see its 
system stats and stellar map.), with JAVA/Opendoc character 
generation/ship construction/planet design, that can be run on OS/2, 
Apple, Unix (most flavors via netscape) Win3.1, WinNT, Win95, Dos (i think)
whatever.

This is absolutely wrong.  For combat use basically need _one_ table 
(which is printed on each character sheet and lists the individual armor 
pieces).  If you don\'t write down stats for NPCs, ok, you\'ll need to 
refer to some tables (I\'d guess about two: the simplified armor table and
the weapon statistics table).

Actually (as far as I know) this was done to prevent legal problems with 
TSR.  Also the new names are not really difficult to learn (take a look 
at the Immortal rpg... that\'s a good example for a truly stupid way of 
re-inventing the wheel).  I\'m a native German and I didn\'t have any 
problems memorizing the names while reading the rules.  The one confusing 
part might be the attribute names and even they are logical if one thinks 
about them.

This is your opinion and IMHO simply stupid.  The editing is not very 
good, yes.  The advanced rules are actually extremely simple (except for 
toying with armors but you can choose several simpler options and for 
spells but that\'s also _very_ easy to fix).

Once you manage to read the manual and actually try the rules, you\'ll 
find that they are very easy to memorize, much simpler to handler than 
GURPS with all its special cases, much faster in combat than HERO, 
Advanced GURPS combat, Rolemaster, ... with as much (or nearly as much) 
detail and generally very user-friendly.  The editing is pretty bad, though.

Back to the topic: are the signed T4 hardcovers already being send out?  Did 
anyone in Germany already order and receive one (I really would like to 
have mine :-).

        Probably, but still it could be later. In Solomani Rim
        sector there is a few worlds colonized by distinct ethnic
        groups during Rule of Man, where the old Terrain languages
        and cultures have remained unchanged. It is possible that
        all major Terrain languages as still used somewhere.

        Fo example, according to "Languages in Traveller" (The Best
        of the Journal, volume IV, 1983), Thorwald is pure ethnic
        planet inhabited by German speakers.

        I once saw an old Swedish RPG magazine that had an Traveller
        article (it was some kind of espionage/shy-hunt adventure,
        but I could not understand Swedish well enough). There was
        two illustrations of a Solomani patrol cruiser, and one of
        these illustrations showed a name plate set on hull:

        "FPC-400C Far Patrol Cruiser,
         Rheinmetal Yards, Saxe/Capella/Solomani Rim"

It isn\'t, I run OS/2. I happen to be able to run some other platforms on
this more flaxible than any other OS, but nobody is breaking down doors
with OS/2 Traveller software. And I was a bit tongue in cheek, it was the
name of the thread that got me going.

As for traveller tools, I like this talk of html/java based tools, then
just about ANYONE could run the exact same tools.

Tom Ellis is obviously a Vilani.  Notice the appeal to written authority.   A
_true_ Solomani would have weighed a gallon of water and reported the
results.   :-)

I will note that the Imperial gallon is nearly 20% larger than the American
gallon, so that a gallon weighs nearly 10lbs in those Commonwealth countries
that still use Imperial, not metric measures.

Parenthetically, historically there have been many different sizes of gallon,
depending on what was being measured.  The American gallon was actually a
standard British wine gallon, adopted during the American Rebellion. 
Opinions differ on whether this was because they had more wine measures in
the colonies, or because the colonial merchants could make more money (rather
like the cereal company slightly shrinking the weight of a package of corn
flakes).

How dare you! (waves his FGMP-15 threatingingly). I\'ll have you know that
the name Ellis in my case dates back to the Solomani Middle Eastern name
"Elias", and was first changed when an ancestor of mine landed on an
island in what was the United States, and island also named Ellis. 

Vilani!*spit* I\'ll give you Vilani, why I outta..... ;)

	I dont think that this is cannon, the first solomanies had
	different languages. Now 1202 Galanglic, which is based on
	Solomany American English, is the only Solomany language
	spoken in the charted space. (Ok there are the islands in
	the riff, where french, russian, and german is still spoken
	on some worlds ;-)

	So I would always, think that names who sound solomany
	are very likely to have solomany origin. And exspecialy
	that names who sound solomany, but not Galanglic should
	be dated back to the first solomany expansion.

	BTW does anybody have an english Kinunir, and can tell
	me if "Allgemeine Raumschiffwerfen" is the original name
	or a !BAD! translation ?

of course, Windows users...
      Andy is heading off imminently for a week so I get to do
these Policy Statement things for now. This is our official policy
as far as platform availability for Traveller Suite:

      "Project Dulinor" is the code name of the effort being conducted
to bring a Suite of software for support of Traveller-4 referees and
players to market.
      The project started with a Alpha/Concept Prototype that was presented
to Ken Whitman and English distributors at EuroGenCon. This Prototype will
be made publicly available early next week over the web at a number of
mirror sites for ease of access. The software will be free but unsupported
and we can\'t guarantee upward compatabilty. The main reason for this release
is to garner user feedback to drive our development and release cycle.
It contains a number of modules similar to ones that may appear in the final
version. 
      Dulinor will be released, itself, over the course of three major 
milestones.
The first milestone\'s major features will be character creation and maintenance,
an astrogator, and a planetary map editor. The target release date is at
OrkCon on the 1st of November. For the other milestones we have tentative
feature lists and project schedules for these releases but they are not firm
enough  to release. Instead we are releasing the Alpha, which contains
representations of most of the final feature set, for free and based on your
feedback we will adjust our development plans.
      Due to market demands the Traveller Suite of software is being
developed with Windows 3.1, 3.11, NT and 95 as the primary release
platform.  We are happy to produce this code on any platform for which there is
demand. Upon completion and release of the first milestone we will
begin looking at what is required to port that over while work progresses
on the second and third milestones.

      That\'s the official statement.
      Speaking as the "technical lead" I understand everyone\'s desires for
cross platform executability. In my day job I work with designing and developing
cross platform tools for Lotus. I\'ve used a number of cross platform development
environments. (My personal preference is for IBM\'s Open Class, and I\'m _not_
just saying that because I work for them!)
      However, any one of these strategies that I have used have one thing in
common: overhead. It takes much longer (2-3 times we\'ve found) to develop
for cross platform use. Yes, in the long run, you save time. But the decision 
that
was made for this project was that "time to market" rated a higher priority than
"available platforms".
      Still, having said that, with the right people using the right tools in 
the right
environments my hopes are high that we will be able to produce additional
platforms with a three month lag time. If you want to volunteer come back to me
in November. In the mean time grab the Alpha when it is available and produce
commentary on that...
         Cheers,
              Jo

Who has information about the folks that are working on the Traveller
CD-ROM Suite?  Perhaps we should forward them all the postings indicating
interest in a Macintosh version.  This would show them the additional
potential sales that have a Hybrid multiplatform version of the suite on
CD-ROM.

Windoze is also not the only choice on Intel hardware. There are far
better choices, OS/2 and Linux to name two. Oh yes...choice was that word

Actually, I couldn\'t agree with you more.  If it wasn\'t for the fact I have so 
much invested in Windows products I would be using OS/2 now.  Heck, we have 
even trained are dogs to bark when they hear Bill Gates or the word 
Micosoft.  I just couldn\'t pass up the chance to tease the Macintosh people. 
<Grin>

Maybe, I missed the point of this CD.  I thought it was going to be a 
collection of software.  Heck, if they want it in Acrobat format they can 
send it to me at I will convert it.

In the TNE game I\'m currently in, we are the Repo team.  I play Eneri
"Pudding" Goldblum, the team attorney.  (don\'t laugh.. his contacts and
liason skill have helped out more times than we can count).  We make a very
comfortable living tracking down skiping starships and other valuable items.
Right now, I\'m defending a Virus infected free-trader which simply wants to
leave Regency space and get on with its life.. 

Repo teams will find you.  Especially if you steal a Free Trader.. A little
money here, and favor there, and I\'ll have every downport worker on seven
worlds looking for you.

looks generally for people in what it considers "noble" professions.
(That\'s what the blackball business is all about: People saying "Oh no, I
don\'t think they\'re _our_ kind of people").  

So Navy people, being the hobnobbers that they are, are a shoo-in, as are
the officers of the elite military (notice that "common" military types in
the Army can\'t get membership).  Agent and Rogues get in as part of a
cover (for those "Debonnaire Rogue" and James Bond types).  

Basically, Scouts don\'t get in because they very rarely travel in social
circles.  They\'re always off grubbing around in the dirt of unexplored
planets and doing other such "anti-social" things.

I know what you\'re thinking, though: Isn\'t this a club for "Travellers"?
Aren\'t scouts really good at that sort of thing?  It is true that they
are, but they aren\'t the kind of travellers who would need assistance most
of the time: they have their own ships and are pretty self-reliant.  The
TAS is for high class Travellers who want to get around without having to
get their feet wet.

This is all, of course IMO.

I posted this message before, but I didn\'t see it here; so I\'m trying
again. Sorry if it got through and I just missed it!

I\'m writing in with some more gripes about the QSDS system as it
appeared in T4. These are things about it that I don\'t really
understand, and I think they are probably errors.

1) In the section on breaking away, on p. 117, the text says that in
order to jump you need twice as many energy points as the jump number of
the jump you\'re attempting. If you can summon the points in one turn,
you can jump in one turn. If you can summon them in two turns, you can
jump in two turns. If you can\'t summon them in two turns, then you
"cannot jump at all."

But in the standard designs shown on pp 100-104, we see ships that
cannot jump at all; their power plant rating is smaller than their jump
number! For instance, the Far Trader has a jump of 2 and a power plant
of 1! There is no way can generate 4 energy points in 2 turns.

This needs to be resolved somehow, preferably by increasing the power
plants of the starships.

2) When I try to duplicate the standard ship designs with QSDS, I run
into trouble with the economics. On p. 101 is an armed fighter that
costs (total) MCr 18. Yet when I look at the table of standard laser
batteries, I can\'t see anything for under MCr 27 for a laser battery
alone! (These weapons are /really/ pricey! Duplicating some of the old
CT adventures is gonna be real tough on the characters\' pocketbooks.)

What\'s the deal here?

Similar problems exist for the gig, free trader, and safari ship.

Well, let me know what you think. I\'m eager to hear fixes,
rationalizations, or explanations.

How did they handle this afterwards?
