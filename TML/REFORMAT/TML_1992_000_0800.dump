Now that I\'m back and trying to catch up on my mail....

On 27 Dec, Hans Rancke-Madsen noted that the UWP data for Pax Rulen and Egyrn
subsectors in the classic adventure _Leviathan_ didn\'t seem to match published
data.  I used to operate a campaign in Egyrn, and the data doesn\'t seem to be
any different between the DGP Digest issue and _Leviathan_.  However, the "old"
sector data on sunbane seemed to be bad, as I recall, where some worlds didn\'t
even match positions.  I think the "new" sector files fixed this.

PS   Interesting thread of discussion.  Who wrote Leviathan anyway?  It had a
     British feel in the writing ("maneover" drives, etc.).  Shows that it was
     a transitional period for Traveller -- remember the "jump message torps"?

Just when you thought it was safe to go in the Vanguard Reaches --

I was looking at my brand-spankin\'-new copy of Solomani&Ftierle (Aslan? what
Aslan?) over break, when something on the Hierate map caught my eye.  DGP
apparently is salvaging some remnants from the old PP work!  Look for these
governments:  Eslyat (formerly located on Beyond/VG border), Zhodani colonies
(same locale, formerly various "Adminstrative Districts"), Federation of
Garonne (formerly a single world in VG, now in Beyond), Duchy of Treyln
(formerly "Trelyn Domain") and the Murians (new location).

On comparison to the old supplement however, it seems that the star positions
were changed, as well as the density in parts of the sectors.  Interesting.
So PP\'s stuff is no longer any good (a mantra often repeated here) but hasn\'t
been completely lost.  I really am going to miss DGP\'s good work in trying to
reconcile old contradictions....

of the universe as envisioned with respect to quantities of merchant shipping
earlier this week.  Others (the Higginbothams and myself among them) have
also commented on this in the past.

(This may ramble...it\'s late and I\'m tired----Scott Kellogg was by for dinner
tonight on his way back to Alabama).  While talking with Scott about this, I
realized that I had been overlooking a resource on my shelf for a long time:
The Encyclopedia Britannica World Data Annual (1989 in this case).  There
is a summary set of tables on a variety of topics, including Transportation.
Under transportation there is a section for sea cargo tonnage loaded and off-
loaded.  Since this is the \'89 book, I assume these figures are from somewhere
between \'85 and \'89.  TAking three examples (China, U.S., and Bangladesh, which
are Traveller populations 9,8, and 7 respectively) we find the following 
numbers:

China 71,000,000 metric tons imported (exports less)
U.S. 425,000,000 metric tons imported (exports less)
Bangladesh 7,500,000 metric tons imported (exports less)

I took the large of the two numbers, since it would put the upper limit on the
number of ships required.  Assume the U.S. to be roughly analogous to an
\'industrial\' planet for sake of argument.  Applying the standard Trav
density fudge factor of 1 ton / cubic meter, we find that 425,000,000 tons
works out to be about 31.5 million displacement tons of cargo arriving per
year.  If this was all carried in bulk freighters with 20,000 tons of useful
cargo space, this would amount to 1574 arrivals per year, or 4.3 per day.
If all of these ships made one jump per two weeks (standard Trav assumption),
and shuttled between \'U.S.\' and planets one jump away, a fleet of 121 bulk
freighters could handle all of the traffic.  Now, if you assume that _all_
of the traffic was being carried in 400 ton Type Rs with 200 tons of useful
space, those numbers would be 100 times higher, and 12,000 Type Rs would be
needed.  You can see how you would go about figuring things with the 
assumptions about round trip voyage time, cargo tonnage and so forth changed,
right?

Bangladesh (free trader territory!! hehehehe) would require about 18 Type A
arrivals per day to carry all of its traffic, so the port would have about
126 ships on the ground at any given time.  

Let\'s see, other assumptions unstated:  these numbers are for tonnage by sea
only as there is no usable data on international rail and road traffic.
International air traffic is given in ton-miles (or metric ton-kilometers),
which means you need to make some guesses about trip length to calculate number
of cargo aircraft departures.  Probably not significant in terms of total
volume.  On the other hand, it would mostly consist of high value cargo and
might provide a different sort of estimate.

Anyway, with these sorts of real world figures available, we should be able
to come up with something that will allow us to make a reasonable guess about
ports and ships.

It\'s tired and I\'m late...enough for now...

not the opposite. This can be confirmed by comparing Diaspora/D and H on the map
with the data on page 96.

   One other comment on it is that the high estimates on interstellar trade 
volume apparently are the correct ones. Otherwise no worlds would be stricken 
so hard by the loss of commerce as they apparently are, and no worlds would
be so dependent on trade that they would fail without it, as some apparently
do.

  I also doubt that it would be business like usual in the regions bordering 
the Imperium while it is going through \'Twilight:1128\'. I\'d expect the fallout
to be bigger in the Imperiums neighbours, but this is almost totally absent.

Hello,
	This is my first venture onto the Traveller Mailing List so if this
question has already come up please bear with me.  

	I may be blind but I cannot find the information in the MT books that 
states the capabilities of computers (ie. memory / cpu size, etc...).  Nor 
can I find any information on available computer programs, such as PREDICT,
NAV, that were from the earlier books.  If anybody could either point me at 
the proper place to look or just mail me the information I would be very
greatful, as my group finaly got a ship last night and they wanted to buy
some new programs for it.

Thanks in advance,

Oh rats! For the last six months I\'ve been working on The
Weltbund, a small interstellar state in the Foreven and Beyond
Sectors. In that connection I\'ve revised the political map of
Beyond considerably. Typical! Two years ago I gave up trying to
get information about Trojan Reach and made up my own whereupon
DGP promptly published the data in Traveller\'s Digest. Sigh!

Yes, I was going by the sunbane data which I got a few months
before the Digest issue in question. Since I had made up my own
data for the top half of the sector anyway, I never used the
sunbane data nor bothered to check the Digest data. I\'m glad to
hear that it was corrected. Mind you, I\'m not surprised that
GDW got it wrong and DGP got it right.

Yep. Perhaps one could allow smaller than 100 T starships, but
retain the minimum size of one jump unit for a jump engine.
That way you could have a 16 2/3 T message torpedo capable of
jump-6 (or could you? I haven\'t the Referee\'s Guide with me, so
I can\'t check the numbers). How much fuel would it need? Could
it manage two jumps if it had nothing but a computer and a
power plant aboard? (Hmmm... a snag: It would need a type 6
computer, wouldn\'t it?).

been put on hold for 1800 years or more (vitness the unchanged
names of countries shown in Traveller\'s Digest #14), I think
that this may very well be explained.

The key lies in the centuries of the Interstellar Wars where
Terra and it\'s colonies were locked in a struggle with the
Vilani Empire, a potentially overwhelming enemy. Terra fought
this conflict under the auspices of a world government whose
combined forces would be too strong for any individual former
country to challenge. Any nationalists would therefor have to
resort to terrorism or possibly guerilla action. This combined
with a "you traitorous scum are hampering our struggle against
the evil Vilani Empire, jeopadizing the future of the entire
human race" line of propaganda could well relegate nationalism
to the same popularity as nazism and racism.

Thus any struggles between the haves and the have-nots during
the Long Night would be in the nature of either replacing the
haves with new ones or at least forcing them to disgorge a bit.
But the concept of one region cutting out and going it alone
would be anathema to everybody, haves and have-nots alike. And
thus the political boundaries of Terra could remain unchanged
through 1800 years and more.

Hi, folks!  Just when I went away for a while, everything breaks loose!  Oh,
well: I\'ve adopted a "wait and see" attitude toward NeoTraveller.  I have
managed to get my hands on Hard Times and Solomani/Aslan: Both look great!
Over the last while, I\'ve been misusing the mainframe at work to do a little
serious number crunching for me.  The results are below.

Several people have posted items about commerce, or the amount thereof, in
the Imperium.  Since I have just finished loading the entire Imperium and
surrounds (from the DGP data files) into a SAS (Statistical Analysis
System) dataset, I thought that might be instructive to look at the problem
from a different point of view.

Using the worlds coded for Imperial or Imperial Faction allegance, the
following statistics for the Imperium of Pre-Rebellion or very early in
the Rebellion.  The "new", rebellion-era statistics were loaded into a
database and tabulated.  The Gross Planetary Product and Taxation rules
from Striker were used to compute the GPP in Local Credits.  The Striker
exchange table was used to convert these to Imperial Standard (Port-A,
TL-15) Credits, which were then taxed at the suggested rates.  Rules from
Trillion Credit Squadron were used to compute the shipyard capacity of
each Class A and B Starport.  The Trillion Credit Squadron construction
rules were also used to estimate the number and size of ships.  The Imperial 
Budget is entirely my own invention; as is the number of starships at each
tonnage class, and the trade between the various classes of starports.

The Third Imperium is a trade protectorate encompassing 10,497 systems
with a total population of about 16,731,817,153,000 sophonts.  The annual 
Gross Imperial Product is 219,474,958,700,000,000 Credits.  This is the 
total value of all of the goods and services produced on all the member 
worlds of the Imperium in one year, adjusted to Imperial Standard Credits.
The Imperium imposes a tax burden of about 1% of the GIP, producing Imperial 
revenues of about 2,194,749,587,000,000 Imperial Standard Credits per year.

The table below shows the major categories of Imperial expenditures, and the
amounts spent on them.  Note that the Imperial family recieves its income
in the form of dividends paid to the Throne (the Imperial family holds
shares in a number of megacorporations, and many lesser companies).  The
Imperial bureaucracy is supported by user fees (application, liscencing,
processing, and other fees paid for official services rendered).  Some
of these services actually produce a profit; others are subsidized by
the Imperium (for example, the XBoat network operates at a loss, but it is
subsidized through the IISS budget).  Much of these funds fall into the
"Other Expenditures" category.  The "Naval Estimates" and "Army Estimates" 
are, for historical reasons, the terms for the Navy and Army budgets.

(all tech levels) of 5,098,672,838 displacement tons for vessel construction.
Its Class B ports have an additional capacity 4,367,049,593 displacement tons
for the repair and annual maintainance of starships.  The table below shows

ALL  1,788   3,382  5,098,672,838  4,367,049,593  100.00  100.00

These figures can be used to estimate the approximate volume of shipping
within the Imperium.  A 10,000 displacement ton hull will be used as an
"average" to estimate construction times.  A hull occupies its tonnage
in the shipyard for its entire construction time of 160 weeks.  Ships
must also undergo annual maintainance; 2 weeks every year.  The yards of
the Imperium have an annual capacity of 265,130,980,000 ton-weeks of new 
construction or maintainance, and an additional 227,086,570,000 ton-weeks 
of maintainance only.  Presumably, the Naval Bases, Naval Depots, Scout 
Bases, and Scout Waystations contain additional ship construction and repair 
facilities to build and maintain ships for the Imperial military services 
(this is a logical extension of the policy that a world\'s survey data does 
not include the personnel or technology of any military bases present).

In peacetime, shipyards and ships presumably exist in an equilibrum: the
number of new ships constructed is the same as the number retired from
service; and all ships in service can recieve their annual maintainance.
In practice, there is always some spare shipyard capacity to provide for
regional differences, trade expansion, and so on.  Let us assume this
spare capacity at 10%.  The active lifetime of a ship must be at least as
long, and probably longer than, the period over which it is financed, 40 
years.  There is good reason (analysis of the Azhanti High Lightning
class cruisers, the only class of ships for which complete records are
available) to believe that the active life can be more than 100 years.
Let us assume that it is 80 years (exactly twice the pay-off time).

Computation:
X = total tonnage in service
X/80 = annual tonnage taken out of service = annual new construction
160*(X/80) = 2*X = shipyard capacity required for new construction
2*X <= 0.90 * 265,130,980,000 (available new construction capacity) - OK!
2*X = shipyard capacity required for annual maintainance
4*X = 0.90 * (265,130,980,000 + 227,086,570,000)
X = 110,748,950,000 displacement tons.

Let:
T = New Ship Construction Time in Weeks
L = Lifetime of Ship, in Years
U = Shipyard Utilization Factor
N = Ton-Weeks of Shipyard Capacity for New Construction
M = Ton-Weeks of Shipyard Capacity for Maintainance
X = Aggregate Tonnage of In-Service Shipping

Therefore:
X = (U * (N+M)) / (2 + T/L)

But:
X <= (U*N) / (T/L)

Interestingly enough, a 5,000 ton ship requires only 144 weeks to complete.
Therefore, 11 5,000 ton ships can be constructed for slightly less shipyard 
capacity as 5 10,000 ton ships.  From a construction point of view, smaller 
ships are more efficient than larger ones.  However, when carrying cargo or 
passengers, larger ships tend to be more efficient. A balance must be 
struck, and 10,000 tons was chosen rather arbitrarily.  The table below
presents a mix of ship sizes; the ratio column indicates how many ships of
a given size can be constructed using the same amount of shipyard ton-weeks.
For the purposes of estimating the number of ships, I will assume (again
rather arbitrarily) that a mixture of ships will be built so that every
10,000 tons of shipping represents an average of 1.6 ships; the Number
column shows how the shipping is distributed to get this total.

Presumably, Class A starports are also primary trade and commerce locations, 
so that most traffic passes through them.  Class B ports would be 
responsible for less of the trade, and so on down through Class E (slim) 
and X (none).  Worlds on a shipping main may receive through traffic, even
if the mainworld is bypassed.  The following table presents a possible 
breakdown.  The ships column indicates the number of arrivals and departures 
(flight operations) per week; less than half this number will be in port at 
any one time.

It is interesting to note that there are 17,719,832 starships registered
in the Imperium; approximately 1,688 for every world.  The frequency of
flight operations at a Class A port is more hectic than the busiest of
present-day airports.  For a commercial starship, between 40% and 60% of
the ship\'s volume will be cargo or passengers; therefore a Class A starport
handles about 13.6 million tons of cargo a week.  This is quite a large
volume of trade, but not enough to feed a planet of billions.

Also note that the above tables are averages over the whole Imperium; not
every Class D port has a ship arriving every half hour.  Some facilities will
go for up to a day without seeing a vessel, but others will have departures
every few minutes.  A better picture could be had by examining a single
sector or subsector.

Let me know what you think ...

Well, the assignment is overwith.  I got the missile plans off to Rob Dean,
The (former) KGB team (Who knows what their alliegence is now?) has no
further interest in me so I guess I am safe for the time being.

Thanks for the offer, but I\'m afraid that the actions of a Merc Division
would only stir them up again.  Besides, I can take care of myself just fine.
As to a certain nosey news taper...  Well, sorry Mark, but the full story of
my disappearance has been classified.

I mentioned the little incident with the JA-37 Viggen.  A sweet little plane!
But I\'m afraid I had a bit of trouble with it.  Sure I use the metric system
on the ground, but in the air, it is a bit more difficult to think in split
second decisions.

The ejection system is a good one.  I give my personal endorsement on that
one, though my shoulder still hurts.  I\'m just glad I had the time to blow
the canopy off first, I wouldn\'t want to have to go through it, despite the
net of charges to blow a hole in it prior to egress.

  But the history of the Rule of Man could disrupt this: The war was over.
It was won. And then the newly aquired colonies almost the entire military
of the victorious part says: "We\'re a new political entity. Bye bye!"
  Imagine MacArthur establishing himself as military dictator of the West 
Pacific Alliance including Japan, Hawaii and all the territory inbetween 
including all US forces there and setting out as a totally independent
political entity that regards the continental US as \'little brother\':)
  My guess as to a possible reaction on Terra when the Rule of Man cut and run 
is great disillutionment with all traces of interstellar government since they
have shown themselves to be either hostile or indifferent. I don\'t think that
the wartime \'we must stick together\' mentality could survive long after the 
threat was gone *and* the spoils of war was totally lost.

  Judging from contemporary politics a big \'musical chairs\' about that eternal
question: "Who shall foot the bill?" would ensue. Different regions and nations
would push for different principles. Some would argue for payment after wealth.
Some for payment after natural resources, some for payment after combat losses
(they who lost the most pay the least) and some would argue that they didn\'t
want that stupid war in the first place so why should they pay for it?
  Any historical arguments about who the blame belonged to would quickly be
forgotten amongst the biased histories the various factions and their supporters
would push out. There is also the big possibility that somebody claims that
EarthGov is a conspiracy against <their country> totally run by <their enemy>
whith the sole purpose of destroying them. Such capers have worked before, and
I sadly see no reason why they should stop working suddenly.
  Small rulers always look for ways of making themselves appear big and 
powerful. One of the best methods is to attack, physically or verbally, some 
big and powerful entity that is guaranteed not to strike back. EarthGov seems
like an ideal target for this kind of attacks, since its reason for existance
is to make things *better* for humankind. If they start issuing frag-orders
for interface figters to go and dump FAE on "nests of anti-internationalist 
terrorists" hither and dither they are just proving their opponents points.

  Remember that we are talking about periods spanning hundreds of years here.
Since ideologies that were totally outdated 45 years ago seem to be on the 
rise now, I see no reason why any ideology couldn\'t make a comback in 200 years
let alone 1800. Imagine the debate on EarthNet some time after the end of the
Nth Interstellar War and after the Fall of Night:
  "What proof does *you* have that the \'vilani\' existed, you totalitarian 
internationalist? Do you have any eye-witnesses that participated in *any* of
the \'Interstellar Wars\'? We have let experts scientifically examine the 
wreckage on display in the victory monument and they found that it is a fake!"
 
  Also note the large number of *ethnically homogenous* worlds all over Charted
Space hailing from *ethnically homogenous* fleets of low-sleep ships from Terra
launched during the Long Night or shortly before. I cannot imagine them 
occuring if there were a EarthGov controlling military and strategic (like 
spaceflight) resources. And the fact that they feel the need to emmigrate from
Earth seems to indicate that everything wasn\'t all that good there.

Scott,

In MegaTraveller the old-time flavor of computers is completely changed.
I\'ve only ever designed one MegaTraveller ship (this being an unplatable
experience) but what I remember (or mis-remember) is this:

Ship designs are created with parts of the ship that require CONTROL
POINTS.  Then, control panels and holodisplays and whatnot provide
CONTROL POINTS.  For example, an automobile design has a motor and
wheels that require X control points, provided by a mechanical panel
that provides X control points.

A computer is a device which multiplies the effectiveness of the panels
and displays (effectively multiplying the productivity of the sophonts
running the panels and displays).

For example, a small cruiser may require 1000 control points.  You can
accomplish this by having a crew of 1000 sitting at mechanical panels,
or with a crew of 20 sitting in front of high-tech displays, or a crew
of 5 with the same displays and a computer.

There are no longer memory/cpu size or specific computer programs.  The
effectiveness of a computer is handled abstractly as a die modifier in
combat and sensor operations.

I miss the old-time Traveller computers.  They were quaint and
cantakerous, and added flavor to the game.

I find it hard to dispute your arguments, because I find them very
plausible. But the key here is that we are not looking at Terra at
the beginning of The Long Night and trying to extrapolate what
might happen. We\'re looking at Terra before and after The Long
Night and trying to interpolate why things _didn\'t_ go the way
you suggest. So the answer here is that it could, but obviously
it didn\'t.

Me neither. So obviously the spoils of war wasn\'t lost. My guess is
that Terra became the regional capital for what was later to become
the Solomani Sphere and got _very_ preferential treatment from Dingir.
Remember, What\'s-his-name the First never called himself Emperor.
Imagine MacArthur keeping on making loyal noices and blaming non-
cooperation on "administrative problems". Would Congress want to
publisize their inability to  control him? Would Joe Public ever
realize the true state of affairs? Perhaps. But now increase the
communication lag to that between Terra and Dingir, and what have
you got? At least a possibility that Terra\'s reactions could be
kept reasonable. Remember, hundreds of more or less virgin worlds
lay around them ready to be colonized or dominated.

>  Judging from contemporary politics a big \'musical chairs\' about that
>eternal question: "Who shall foot the bill?" would ensue.

I\'m not saying all this wouldn\'t happen. I\'m just saying that
if nationalism has become a swearword, then anybody would have
to pay lip service to the concept of World Unity. I wouldn\'t
say that slavery will never reappear in Denmark, but I don\'t
think it will be called slavery.

Another possibility is that Terra never lost jump capacity. I
don\'t see why they should have, in fact. It just became
unprofitable to trade across more than a few parsecs. Propably
Terra kept up contact with the nearest dozen worlds, exploiting
them to keep everybody at home satisfied. They would\'ve fought
wars during The Long Night, yes, but with their colonies, not
between regions.

Oh, one more thing: for this to work, a stable population must
have been established, with population artificially controlled
at a given level.

True, lack of ressources allows the weirdos, the sickos and the
powermongers free play. But a sufficiency of ressources gives
the sane people a chance. Only a chance, granted, but apparently
Terra lucked out during the Long Night. The solution would be a
controlled populations _and_an_absence_of_rivals_.

What fleets? The ships that colonized Old Islands Subsector were launched
prior to the invention of the jump drive. As for the ethnical homogenous-
ness of a lot of worlds I refer to my library data piece about National
Reemergence for a plausible (well, I think it\'s plausible) explanation.

Oh, I don\'t know. There will allways be idealist and/or misfits. How
about people who wanted to have more than a child apiece? Try turning
your argument around. Would a region use ressources on outfitting
colony ships, if there were fighting/in danger of fighting a war? If
any colony ships were launched during the Long Night, then that
rather argues for a superabundance of ressources. Such fleets would
after all be a total loss to the economy with no prospect of any future

Copper Cr0.2 50g, Silver Cr10 30g, and Gold Cr300 30g. I do not doubt for a

price of gold in dollars per troy ounce (about 30g) which is around $350 today
I think:)
  The trouble is that 30g coins get awfully large. The old and rightly 
disdained AD&D 1st edition "gold piece" came ten to the pound, which indicate
a weight of 45g. Even 2nd edition AD&D coins have much more resonable weights.

  So I propose that the weights and values are to be divided by five, except
for the copper which is divided by two. Still too large but less too large 
because otherwise the value gets too low.

  This, btw, ignores any problem with unstable metal prices.

  Now, on to Earth:

  Earth Now has an UPP of (E867972-8  514) adapted from a template in The
Traveller Book. Earth 1121 has (A867A69-F 414). Earth when the Long Night
begins should have an UPP of (A8*7***-C *14) where the atmosphere might be
normal or normal-tainted, The population is probably around 8 to 12 billion,
The government might be considered a 4 (representative democracy) or an 8 
(civil service buerocracy) depending on how you view the UN and how it might
evolve. The lawlevel is almost totally irrelevant and the techlevel is \'C\'
because the Terrans got jump-3 during the Interstellar Wars.

  Depending on wether you regard the Solomani Rim during the Long Night as a
Frontier or an Outland different outcomes are possible. The S&A talks about 
raiders from the chaos inside the ROM, and some Aslan incursions, so I\'m leaning
towards Outland, but it is not certain.

  Columns of letters are all the different values that can occur. Columns
marked with * are those where the changes result from Hard Times effects. Only
the extremes will be listed for the lawlevel figure. Xeno is the effective 
xenophobia of the planet, it is the number of levels the lawlevel is higher 
for outsiders than for natives. Isol lists if the planet has a *chance* of
becomming isolationist.

The message which looked at getting some numbers for the Imperial economy
was very interesting.  You\'d think that we\'d have heard that the Imperium\'s
population was about seventeen quadrillion a few times before now, wouldn\'t
you?  I\'d like to hear a little more about the assumptions built into this
rough estimate.  For instance, why the class-A ports get significantly more
traffic despite their reduced numbers.  How did you decide on the Imperial
tax rate?  What influences the GPP figures for a planet, and to what extent,
for those of us unfamiliar with whatever formula -- ditto with port facilities.

Do these figures assume a strong economy?  I know that part of the reason for
appointing Dulinor to Ilelish was to help relieve the region\'s persistent
economic recession.  Ilelish was a bit of a backwater, ignored by the 
Empire in favor of the frontier and core regions.  

If they still believe in deficit spending, the Imperial debt could be in the
QUADRILLIONS or worse -- that\'s BILLIONS of MCr!

Still, very interesting.  It gives one an idea of the sort of scale that
we\'re dealing with here....

  I\'m not totally convinced about that because our data is sadly lacking. 
Almost all we have are two datapoints: UN-something have become a defacto
EarthGov before/during the Interstellar Wars and Terra is probably united
when the Dawn comes.

  It would be as if shown two pictures of Europe 1800 years apart, one over
the Roman Empire year 200 and one over the (potential) EEC year 2000. 
A deduction from that might be that the changes in 1800 years are that
the focus of the political entity has gone northwards, the different regions
(called \'nations\') have become more independent, the name have changed, and
the government has changed. The two latter probably happened at the same time
with the change in government leading to the change of name.

  I think it is very possible, keeping in mind that a lot of things can 
happen during 1800 years, for a planet to begin as one entity, balcanize in
several periods, fight some wars and unite again.

  S&A talks about the Dusk and mentions that the Old Earth Union, which
apparently included Terra and some worlds probably not further from Terra
than 10 or 15 parsecs, failed during one point in the Night, that all 
habitations in the Solar System except for Luna were abandoned at some
time during the night and that the Terran Mercantile Community existed at one
point during the night. It still leaves half-a-millenium sized holes in the
history.

  When discussing Terran participation in Interstellar communities during
the Long Night it is interesting to note that one of the prerequisites for
something like this to form in the first part of a Night is jump-1 access
to other worlds. Terra has only 4 neighbours on jump-2 distance and none on
jump-1. Had there been just one less neighbour on jump-2, Terra would have got
the Hard Times classification of "Isolated" which would have made matters
worse.

  My guess as to the effective TL of Terra during the Long Night is 9, since
this is the lowest that supports jumptech. This is a fall of 4 units from 
the C level they had at the end of the wars. Imagine the depression that can
make a TL go down 4 units. It is like going from today to before the Wright
brothers.

  Going from S&A, there are two periods of mass emmigration from Terra. 
The first is where big groups of various small nationalities go and colonize
because they fear that EarthGov and the situation on Terra will effectively
annihilate their cultures (through dissolution and absobtion). This occur
around the Fall of Night.
  
  The second wave, not stated explicitely, occur around -400 Imperial and it
is now those who will eventually become the Sworldworlders leave. This is at
the absolute depths of the night. This isn\'t commented upon, but it has a
mark on the timeline.
 
  BTW: You mention your library data entry, and I remember it mentioning a
planet called Funftreich. It made me wonder were the Fourth Reich were. My bet
would be on Terra, during the Night.

To change the subject to rules analysis (as opposed to Universe analysis),
Cynthia and I have been beating on the Commerce rules to make them work a
little better.  We have the following sugestions that seem to work:

    1)  Remove the starport modifier to cost of goods.  Instead place it on
the resale price of your goods.
    It makes very little sense to assume that the size of the transport hub
will affect the avilability and price of LOCAL products.  A lousy starport
might indicate that very little imports happen, but that will only drive up
the price of the imports, not locally produced goods.  Moving that modifier
will simulate reality slightly better, and encourage PCs away from the
High-pop A starport worlds they normally are forced to frequent to pay for
that shiny new starship.
    2)  ON Novelties ONLY, apply starport modifiers to resale price from
BOTH starport of origin and destination starport.
    Therefore, novelties will be more valuable moving from type E to Type E
starports - From places that don\'t export much to places that don\'t import
much.  Therefore the prices will match the scarcity necessary for
novelties.
    3)  Apply a T:2000 breakdown number to starships.
    Suddenly, starships have a systematic method of determining mechanical
problems.  They also are now available for REALLY low prices, if you don\'t
mind buying something that breaks down quite a bit.  Net effect - more
starships for the PCs, and more accidents for the GM to exploit.  Good idea
all around.

Hmmm...
Everything else is still experimental at this point.  Better wait on the
rest.

Has ANYONE done any work on Sensor tasks???
The original stuff(referees guide) is dreck.  With interstellar range
passive sensors, and the most sensitive neutrino sensor known to Imperial
science, detecting a Tigris at much beyond 1.5 light seconds is next to
impossible (10+ at that range, 12+ at 500 Mm, 16+ at 2 light seconds, etc.)
The guidelines from Knightfall, World Builder\'s Handbook, and everywhere
else I\'ve looked are mostly worse.  At least they integrate detection range
with task difficulty, but there is no consistent method indicated.
Any comments?  Suggestions?  Whatever?

I\'d go for a Safe myself. Remember, The Long Night was a slow
decay, not a catastrophic event. Step 1 of Hard Times hits the
high-population, good starport worlds hardest, but that\'s
because they were specifically targeted. It takes a warfleet to
make an impression on a high-population world. Nothing else
will. Certainly not a band of half-assed raiders. Try working
out the defenses of Terra: 10 billion inhabitants @ 500 credits
gives a yearly budget of 5 trillion credits. The fleet is
equivalent to 10 times that. Even if you put 99% of those ships
in ordinary to reflect a depressed economy, you still wind up
with 500.000 MCr worth of ships. The fleet that can challenge that
is not a raider fleet, it\'s a 3rd Imperium fleet.

I don\'t dispute that balcanization is a very possible outcome,
just that it is the only possible outcome. And from what we
know it is, in fact, not the outcome. As for Hard Times,
Hard Times talks of the Twilight of a particular Night and I
don\'t think that it can really be applied to The Long Night.

In short, it makes a great substance to denote value without usefulness.

The recent discussion of the *large* amount of takeoffs and landings on the
larger worlds (someone mentioned one every 1.4 seconds or so on Trin) has forced
me to give up on the idea of "one world, one starport."

I think a much more reasonable assumption is that the starport code only
represents the best available facilities on a world.  Most of the interstellar
traffic is going to be handled by existing airport facilities.  After all, you
have everything you need - proximity to large metropolitan areas, pre-existing
facilities for transferring cargo to/from rail or trucks, experience with
dealing with large amounts of air traffic, hangar space, etc etc.

I\'m not familiar enough with air travel to be sure, but aren\'t there 75+
international airports here on Terra?  That would make for roughly one per
couple of minutes, less if you consider that your average scout or free trader
doesn\'t really need much more than a wide space for a landing facility.  One
PC in a campaign I ran about 10 years ago used to land his ship right outside
of the factory he was buying the weapons he was smuggling (He used to land
inside the fence until an unfortunate mishap involving a lousy pilot and a
tractor trailer).

  One thing that I noticed in Hard Times is that the Strephonian era Imperium
apparently were a relatively peaceful and trusting place. It is especially
noted that "Many starports have emplaced missile batteries to repel unwanted
visitors" and that cargo is now NAS-ed to detect stowaways.

  I\'ve always assumed that these measures were in effect. Some commercial
airports in the world today have SAM-batteries, and almost all Swedish harbours
have some form of coastal artillery dug into some appropriate island. Usually
not manned, but it is there. As for NAS-ing: It is easy, it is fast, it is 
cheap and I\'ve included it in the "General Scan" done for a small fee on demand
along with densitometer and other scans for weapons and explosives.

  Judging from this it might seem that my(?) most paranoid idea that planets 
require all large buildings to include a small laser turret on the roof is far
to paranoid for the pre-Rebellion era.

  I interpret the Hard Times rules as that they are to be applied on *all* 
worlds inside the bounds of the Imperium. Worlds that are in Safe areas never
touched by the tiniest trace of the war get the same treatment, but without
the Frontier, Outland, Wilds, Warzone, Intense Warzone and Black Warzone DM\'s.
  This leads me to belive that the major effect in Safe areas isn\'t from
the physical destruction of the starport facilities but more from the 
destruction of shipping and markets, leading to the starports going bancrupt
or cutting down on operations if they can\'t make a profit.

  There is no need to go in the hard way with blazing lasers and all that.
All that is needed is that the threat of piracy is so big that merchants 
fear to travel, leading to economic recession and lesser demand for starships
from the yards at the starport, leading to more pirates competing for fewer
merchants, leading to more desperate pirates, leading to more afraid merchants
and so on.
  
  There is no need for this to happen close to Terra. Anywhere within their
economic sphere would be ok. As the merchants begin to neglect high risk
routes the pirates will follow them inwards.

  I seem to remember from the COACC book that the defences of Terra when the
Rule of Man set off on it\'s own were primarily in-system assets. It is of
course possible to build jump-capable ships to patrol the spacelanes, but
the instance the total costs from the trade (including militart escorts) is
greater than the gain of the trade to either the government or the merchants
the trade will cease. And the colonies will be in deep dodo.

  [Btw: I\'ll expect that most of the piracy will cease during a Night as soon
as the trade collapses totally. No sheep -> starving wolves. The time for
this to happen is ofcourse dependent on the rate of decline. As the decline 
into the Long Night were rather slow, pirates could have held out hundreds
of years.]

> ROM? What\'s that?

  Rule of Man. Here is, quoted condensed and paraphrazed what Rats&Cats say
about the Long Night:

  The Long Night were less hard on the worlds in the Rim than those in the
former ROM. Terra and Friends had relatively self-sufficient economies. At 
the center of ROM piracy and plunder were rampant.
  Terra and the original confederation worlds (probably about 40 parsecs radius
from Terra) organized into the Terran Mercantile Community which reformed into
a government in -1690. They had to protect their trade from pirates and 
renegade naval units from the center of ROM. 
  As time passes trade dry up except on a subsector level. The TMC fail and
Terra and \'the local community\' (say 5 pc radius) organize into the Old
Earth Union in -1110. Now some of the other ex-confederation states in 
Dark Nebula, Alpha Crucis, Magyar and Reaver\'s Deep begin to raid their
neighbours closer to the center (of the Terran Confederation). This ended when
the Aslan arrived and sporadic fighting with the Aslan continued until 380.

  Regardless of the direct effect on Terra, the "devastating" raids would have
further destroyed interstellar trade in the Rim area.

A couple of interestng (and perhaps non-obvious) things follow from my analysis
of the shipbuilding capacity of the Imperium.  The most important is that
the volume of shipping is *INVERSELY* dependent on the size of the ships used
to carry it.  This is because larger ships require more of a shipyard\'s
capacity, in addition to taking longer to construct!  When I calculated my
shipping volume, I assumed an "average" mix of ships, taking the same amount
of starship resources as one 10,000 ton vessel, and yeilding 1 ship per
million ton-weeks of shipbuilding capacity, with an average displacement of
6,250 tons per vessel (and presumably about 3,125 tons of cargo capacity).
Recomputing with 200-ton traders would result in over 3.3 times the total
volume of shipping (and presumably a similar increase in cargo capacity).

The Trillion Credit Squadron rules I used were probably never meant to apply
to civillian, merchant shipbuilding capacity; I used them because they were
the only ones available.  Better rules should include multipliers to the
capacity based on Tech Level and trade categories, as well as for Population
and Government Type.  Similarly, the trade through a port should be dependent
on the world\'s population, government type, law level, tech level, and trade 
categories, and astrographic location, as well as its starport type.

Nevertheless, let us proceed boldly into the fray.  I computed an "average"
Class A port as handling 27.3 million tons of shipping in a week.  This would
include all imports, exports, and trans-shipments.  Halving this number gives
an estimate of the total *CARGO* volume (remember, I was using the total volume
of the ships involved): 13.65 million tons a week.  For simplicity\'s sake,
I will assume that 50% of this is imports, with the balance being exports and
trans-shipments; this gives us a final figure of 6.8 million tons of imports
per week.  For comparison, US imports of 31.5 million tons works out to about
0.6 million tons per week (I\'ve been working in Displacement Tons all along).

If the US is taken to be an "average" Class A world, the Traveller shipyards
can maintain this level of trade (in terms of constructing and maintaining
the starships) even if the ships are as large as an average of 50,000 tons.
However, if the US is taken to be an "average" TL-7/8 world (and therefore
much more probably a Class B or even Class C port), then the major Imperial
worlds (with tech levels in the 14 to 15 range, and Class A starports) could be
doing 10 to 20 *TIMES* the trade of the US.

While these volumes of trade are not enough to supply a world with the staples
of life, it is more than enough to make a massive difference in the tech level
and quality of life (excercise: look around and mentally "remove" everything
that has been imported from overseas; remember that some components that you
take for granted may be imported - like the DRAM in your computer).

Major gaming effects:
  o Worlds (small outposts and stations excepted) is probably self-sufficent
    in terms of staples (air, water, basic foods, fuel) although the production
    or distribution of these may involve imported equipment or skills.
  o A majority of the available consumer goods are likely to be imported (or
    produced primarily for the export market, depending on whether the world
    is primarily an importer, like the US, or an exporter, like Japan).
  o A busy port will have many hundreds, up to thousands, of ships operating
    around it; probably at a large number of separate facilities (the World
    Builder\'s Handbook provides quite nicely for this).  A port is likely to
    be as busy as a major US airport, with vessels arriving and departing
    every two to fifteen minutes.
  o Even the sleepiest of ports will have a flow of traffic; anywhere from a
    ship a day to one every couple of weeks.

Rebellion effects:
  o Destruction of shipbuilding capacity has a long-term effect; if the yard
    is not rebuilt, the effect becomes cumulative as worn-out ships are not
    replaced.  The average starship will become older and less reliable, as
    ships are kept in service due to a lack of replacements.
  o Destruction of ships has an immediate effect; even if all shipyards are
    left intact, because of the long time needed to construct any ship.
    Replacements are likely to be smaller ships, because they can be built
    faster, and with fewer shipyard resources.

Now I\'m getting confused. Didn\'t you start this thread by pointing out that
Terra had apparently gone through the whole Long Night without any
significant changes to regional names? Are you saying now that the name
changes _are_ significant? If so, what\'s the problem?

That\'s a revision of what they said in _Solomani Rim_. I dug SR up last
night, and it states that Terra during The Long Night was the capital of
the Old Earth Union (containing "most of the early Terran colonies from
Barnard to Forlorn and from Dismal to the merchant refuelling station at
Sirius"; approx. 17 worlds) and that it and The Easter Concord, The Vegan
Polity and The Dingir League survived the Long Night "by trading within
themselves and maintaining their defenses". No mention of any Terran
Merchant Community or any catastrophic failure of the Old Earth Union.

It didn\'t need to form, it was there to begin with. It contracted down
to 17 worlds. And I don\'t think that any world containing most of the
human beings in a subsector can really ever be called isolated. The
rest of the subsector might be considered isolated from it...

You\'re arguing in circles. A depression that can drop Terra 4 tech levels
must be very severe, so Terra propably dropped 4 tech levels. But what if
Terra didn\'t drop 4 tech levels? That would mean that the depression wasn\'t
all that bad, so propably Terra didn\'t drop 4 levels ;-)

I think that in order to maintain the Old Earth Union, they must have
retained jump-2 at least, and I don\'t see why they need to have lost
jump-3 at all. Wait, I take that back. Looking at the astrography of the
Solomani Rim it makes sense that they lost jump-3 and retained jump-2.
That would leave the Union isolated. The worlds to rimward are mostly
empty, to spinward and coreward the Dingir League and the Vegan Polity
jealously guards their own trade planets and to trailing is a three parsec
gap that makes trade that way unprofitable.

Note that the fact that the rimward worlds remained empty indicates a lack
of population pressure, which indicates population control, which would
allow a really stable economy. Stable, but stagnant.

Pity. In my personal Traveller universe I put the first diaspora during the
Rule of Man years. Expanding economy, United Nations ideology (nationalism
is BAD, but peaceful culturalism is good). I don\'t think I\'ll change that.
It makes more sense that small groups can afford to emigrate in a boom
period than in a depression. (And afore you mention how America was filled,
I mean a depression that affects both the emigration and the immigration
planets).

- -400 is not the depths of the  night. On the contrary, it\'s well into
the dawn. According to SR, "trade was reestablished in many areas by
- -500". And that makes sense. Any economy that could afford to send off
the Swordworlders had to have at least a little surplus. In fact,
unless Rats&Cats directly contradict this, I\'ll suggest that the Terran
Mercantile Community is the trade sphere created by the Old Earth Union
at the end of the Night.

Funftreich is nonofficial, it\'s a planet I made up to supply
the people who colonized the Weltbund area. (That\'s why it\'s
placed in a sector for which I had no data :-). Actually, the
Fourth Reich is supposed to be now (or in a few years). Remember
that much of the history and culture of these neo-nationalist
planets are more or less made up to specification. The ideology
of Funftreich were not "Deutchland uber alles" but "Our ancestors
were amazing folks and we must strive to be worthy of them".
History was rewritten to fit. This happened a lot when abandoned
planets went neo-nationalist.

Always remembering that the two enemies that threathen the Domain would _not_
target high-population worlds for destruction. Aslan _ihatei_ wants land, so
they would concentrate on low-population worlds (IMO the attack on Aki is
completely implausible). Besides, their methods are mostly peaceful. Certainly
they would not use either nuclear or bacterial weapons (Yes, I know they\'ve
been reported to use both, but think about it. Nuclear weapons are obviously
ridiculous. Aslan motives is to acquire land. Killing humans (if necessary) is
incidental. So who\'s going to kill humans by nuking and render the land
uninhabitable? Silly notion. Bacterological weapons seems more reasonable
at first, but would an _ihatei_ fleet really risk starting a biowar with
humans? How long could they expect to keep their new land? If the aslans
really did try bioweapons then there may indeed be a couple of new glowing
planets in the Domain, but otherwise, no.) (So what are the Wilds and the
Outlands between the Domain and the aslans doing there? Beats me.)

Incidentally, would anybody care to calculate the economics of _ihatei_
fleets? How big a percentage of _ihatei_ can each aslan generation afford
to send off? How many ships would the Domain need to beat off a century\'s
accumulated _ihatei_, assuming that every single one went across the Great
Rift instead of some of them going rimwards? How many would they need,
if they can play off one clan against another? How many ships would they have
in their rimward subsectors even if they sent all the regular ships coreward
to deal with the vargr and just left the subsector forces?
I\'d be interested to compare your findings to mine.

As for the vargr raiders, they want loot. They _need_ loot to maintain
their fleet. They do _not_ need to get the fleet shot to bits in the
process of acquiring the loot. Now, what targets are they going to select,
low and medium population worlds with reasonable defenses or high-population
worlds with defenses equivalent to a couple of trillion credit squadrons?

A while ago, there was a small discussion of the life support costs of living
on a starship.  Specifically the 2000 Cr per person per jump (Jump being
about 2 weeks approx because I assume they are including time for in system
manuvering.)  So that comes out to 1000 Cr per week per person in life support
costs.

Ok, what does it pay for?  Good question.  Well, according to the Ref\'s
manual the cost/power/weight/volume of lights, heat, air, cooking, waste
recycling etc. does not change from TL 5 all the way to TL 21.  If so then
the technology used must be similar to that currently used.

Ok, that means you are going to need carbon dioxide filters, dust filters
and such that are going to have to be replaced on a regular basis.  Also
Emergency life support equipment is going to have to be serviced from time
to time, not to mention perisable medical supplies which will need to be
purchased if used or not.  (perhaps a wily starship crew could resell these
to dirtside hospitals before the expiration date was completely up to help
cut costs?)

Food?  Well it isn\'t that expensive, I have seen figures published saying
good food was about 200 Cr per week (I\'ll have to check that)
I also remember there was a bit in the Traveller Adventure on the cost of
breathing air.  (Aramis has an air tax I believe)  I think it was 150 Cr
per week (Of course that includes the cost of beaurocracies)

Still, I these are small costs overall.  What I think would soak up the most
cash would be the cost of various equipment maintainance.  Most aircraft
undergo maintainance inspections every 100 hrs of flight and a major inspection
every 1000 hrs (Sorry I\'m only a student pilot not an aircraft owner)
Starships on the other hand have their overhauls every year.  A year of
operation is a LONG time.  I\'d guess that the 1000 cr per week goes mostly
toward routine equipment replacement and spares.

Speaking of air replenishing systems, I read a while ago on sci.military about
\'Oxygen Candles\' which are an emergency air system on submarines.  Basically
it is a \'candle\' (quite large: 30cm diameter by 50cm high) which \'burns\'
releasing oxygen and heat as it does so.
	I imagine it as a kind of oxydizer rich solid rocket fuel.  Not that it
produces any thrust, but that it is a material which holds the oxygen
chemically, and releases it upon being heated.  The oxygen burns the \'candle\',
heating it, releasing more oxygen.

I would assume these are carried aboard ships for emergency use.  Now, it has
been pointed out that there are existing worlds in the spinward marches which
would be \'failing\' before the trouble started.  Say a Vaccum world with too
low technology.  Explain it?  Well, how about an naturally occuring mineral
deposit similar to these \'oxygen candles\'?  It would be a local material that
would find a ready market!

While the old Traveller system is okay, it does have some problems.
Here are a few things I found to be rather helpful:

Combat System
- ----

Multiple Attacks:
In a 15 second combat round, it is somewhat unrealistic to assume that
a character may only fire once (excepting panic fire and bursts from
automatic weapons). There is an easy way to allow a character multiple
shots. Each additional shot is at a cumlative -1 to skill. So, for example,
three shots in a round will all be at -2. There are a few additional
modifiers. A revolver is an additional -1. A bolt action rifle has a -3,
not a -1, penalty. Automatic weapons may fire additonal bursts, but
the penalty is -2. Due to the variable loading times of single shot
weapons (muskets, grenade launchers, bows, etc), the GM must determine if such 
weapons can fire more than once per round, and at what penalty.

Hit Points:
While the damage system is somewhat realistic, it is also somewhat cumbersome.
An easier way to handle the amount of damage a character takes is to add up
the character\'s Strength, Dexterity, and Endurance, and treat it as a hit point
pool. After combat, the character then reassigns the points back to stats.
Obviously, no stat can end up higher than it was before combat began. Also,
when a character reaches 0 hp, he passes out. Death occurs when the character
reaches a negative score equal to or greater than the character\'s Endurance.

Weapon Damage:
The damage of several weapons should be changed:
	Body Pistol - 1d6	Revolver - 2d6		Auto-pistol - 2d6
	Rifle - 4d6

Armor System:
Rather than having armor reduce the chance for an attacker to hit the
opponent, the armor should reduce damage. Each type of armor is rated
for three types of defense: melee, ballistic, and laser. High energy
weapons are defended against by the lower of the ballistic and laser
numbers. In each category, the armor has a certian number of dice.
If the defender is hit, roll the damage for the weapon, and then the 
resistance for the armor. If the armor\'s roll is equal to or greater than
the damage roll, the defender takes no damage. If the damage roll is
greater, subtract the resistance roll from the damage roll, and apply to
the defender. Optional ammo types can easily be recreated -- AP rounds
halve the armor\'s resistance roll, but do only half damage to the target
(halve damage AFTER armor is accounted for). Hollow point ammo doubles
the resistance roll, but any damage that gets through does double damage
to the target. When determining the to-hit modifier for each weapon, use
the Unarmored modifier, regardless of what the target is wearing.
			       
				resistance vs
	armor type	melee	ballistic	laser
	----	----
	jack		1d6	1d6/3		0

	ablat		1d6	1d6/2		3d6
	reflec		0	0		4d6
		*-not an official armor, but included for completeness

Starships:
- ----

Fuel: By all means use the powerplant formula in High Guard: 0.01xPnxTonnage.
Also, the formula for determining jump fuel should use 0.05 rather than
0.1. Otherwise, the fuel required is (at least for my tastes) far too much.

Jumpdrives: I have a few optional rules for this. There are three enhancements
that a jump drive may have. The first (the Hawking Drive) allows the ship
to only be in jump for 3.5 days. This enchancemnt increases JD cost by 25%
and mass by 10%. The second (Biron Override) allows the ship to jump from
a gravity well with reduced hazards. Drop the penalties by 5. Cost of the
JD doubles and mass increases by 25%. The final enhancment (Liau Drive) allows
the JD to operate at approximately double its rating. Fuel consumption is
doubled, and there is a +1 to the mis-jump chance (+2 if the ship goes beyond
a jump-6). Cost and mass are as the Biron Override. Also, the drives must be
worked on for 1-3 hours after such a jump. If not worked on, roll a 9+ on
2d6 for the drive to fail when activated. For each forced maintanence missed,
lower this by 2. All three can be placed on the same jump drive. Also, ships 
under 100 tons CAN use jump drives, though cost is doubled. 

Character Generation:
- ----

Skill Improvement:
To me, this is the one major area where Traveller is lacking. I have problems
with rules that basically state that a character can never improve skills
by experience. At the end of an adventure, the GM should look over each 
character\'s skills, and place a check by each one the GM felt the player
used in such a way that the character would have learned from it, or that
the character used a skill repeatedly under difficult situations. For
each skill with a check, the character must FAIL a roll of 5+(2*skill level).
For example, a character with Rifle-3 must roll a 12 to improve his skill.
Obviously, a character with a skill of 4+ cannot improve skills by mere
experience. They are so highly skilled that \'mundane experience\' will fail
to help them, since they have few problems with even difficult situations.
These are the kinds of characters that must study to improve skills.

Howdy! I am a fairly new member of the TML, but I have a few
questions for those of you out there. I just purchased the SGS
25mm deckplans for the Empress Marava Far Trader and noticed
some very interesting things.

First off, the A2 far trader they describe displaces 400 tons! The
stats given in the book, although supposedly taken from the Imperial
Encyclopedia, are roughly as follows:

     400 tons, TL13, Power = Fusion 1665Mw.
     Loco is Jump-2, Maneuver-1.
     4 hardpoints are mounted, along with a 1/bis computer.
     10 staterooms and 4 low berths
     Fuel 1314 kl, Cargo 1188 kl, purif plant, etc.

What really bothers me about this, however, is the fact that the
deckplans are directly lifted from Supp. 7 Traders and Gunboats,
where the Empress Marava class was a 200 ton Far Trader! Thus, the
book gives deckplans for a 200-ton ship and stats for a 400-ton ship.

What I would like to know is if this "quality" is typical of all of
the deckplans produced by SGS.

One other note ---- the deckplans come with a story, not an adventure
as I assumed from reading the blurb on the back. Also, the stats given
in the booklet are about 800 kl shy of 400 tons (at least from the
quick computations I did).


Sorry to whine, but I had to say something. This kind of quality
really upsets me.

* Craw has a native race, and is probably not "failing" as far as they are

* Victoria has a minor human race??  Likewise.

All these worlds with the above exceptions must be considered dependent on
massive offworld imports to maintain themselves.  Since at least one of
them,
Nakege, is a trade sink, how they manage to afford imports is a mystery to
me.

I see no reason why Terra should have lost ANY TLs during the Long Night.
If merchant traffic continued, as implied in Supplement 10 (Solomani Rim),
then that traffic would have been J2 (probably), and state-of-the-art would
have been J3 (for the Navy, and possibly the pirates).
Since Terra was a high pop world, and center of a polity in its own right,
it probably used bulk carriers for MOST of it\'s off-world trade.  I cannot
imagine the pirate willing to attack an ARMED 20,000 ton ship.  I cannot
imagine the Terrans NOT arming their merchants in that situation.

The TL losses in Hard Times seem to deal largely with the long term effects
of nuclear bombardment of the planetary infrastructure.  Since none of that
occurred on Terra during the Long Night, Hard Times provides no valid
indicators of the effects of the Long Night on Terra.

BTW, as to the Nationalist question on Terra, note that 2300AD introduces a
plausible scenario for transportation of nationalism to the reaches of
known (and occasionally unknown) space.

And, to change the subject, has anyone noticed that Hard Times is entirely
humanocentric?  It assumes that any world with characteristics that make it
uninhabitable to humans will be "failing" or "dommed".  I\'m sure any
non-human native race  would be surprised to discover they could no longer
live on their home planet since the TL has dropped.   After all, they
EVOLVED there for the local conditions, didn\'t they?

Which brings up the question of which worlds are homeworlds?
What minor races are out there that might use these "failing" and "doomed"
worlds as potential colonies now that the humans have gone home?

colonizing until we\'re sure we can survive on the way.

For MT:TNG why not something like just forgetting to include such a 
ridiculous feature?  Call it part of the engine and jull maintenance.

Okay, first of all, there were a couple of errors and such in the optional
rules I sent for Old/Classic Traveller:
	(1) damage of the body pistol is 2d6, not 1d6
	(2) for the jump drive enhancement that allows it to jump
	double its normal factor, if the computer is too small, the
	jump can still be made, but it takes 10 times longer to compute
	the jump for each computer size under what is needed (so, for
	example, a factor 6 computer takes 10^6 (!) times longer to
	compute a jump-12 than a jump-6). Also, I would recommend that
	instead of using the myriad of jump programs, that there is just
	one astrogation program (say, use the Jump-3 program).
	(3) The \'one hardpoint per 100 tons\' should be taken as a legal
	limit, not a practical one. A ship can mount as many hardpoints
	as desired, though the GM needs to do a reality check (and perhaps
	deck plans) to make sure they would all fit and still leave normal
	ship functions working fine.
There may be some other stuff, but I can\'t remember it off-hand.

Back when I fist started GMing Traveller back in late 1983, I decided to
do something that ended up really irking my main player (and a fellow
Traveller GM) -- I ignored the background and set my campaign 500 years
in the future, after the fall of the Third Imperium (actually, I was just
ahead of my time...). The player thought what I was doing was blasphemous,
and that I was ignoring the best part of the game. However, I had some good
reasons for doing so: while it required more work for me (in all the years
since, the campaign has never left the sector it started in, though), it
meant I wasn\'t dependant on material from GDW or related companies, and if
they made major changes to the background, I wouldn\'t have to alter my
campaign to be official, or to be able to use future products. As a side note,
no player after the first one was unhappy with me using my own setting.

As an off-shoot of the \'after-the-fall, the Second Long Night\' campaign,
all the ships, were of neccessity, small. Face it, after a major war and
several minor ones destroyed most industrial planets, shipyards COULDN\'T
produce 20,000 ton freighters or 100,000 ton cruisers. The largest ship
that is in any navy currently is a 6,000 ton \'dreadnaught\'. Most heavy
cruisers are 1,000-2,000 tons. There are some bulk transports that are
about that size, but they are slow and unweildy, and sitting targets
for pirates unless escort is provided. Granted, in a campaign set 
in the early stages of the Rebellion, ship construction won\'t be TOO
severely effected, but by the late stages, few large ships will be built,
and most large ships already in service will no longer have ports to
get repaired at (having off course been destroyed during the Rebellion).
About the only thing that would keep total disaster from befalling the
old Imperium would be the independant merchants in their small (200-400 ton)
freighters, plying the shipping lanes between each war-ravaged planet.

I never did take Maths to really advanced levels, so I might be wrong, but
isn\'t C supposed to represent decimal 12?  And if so, from C (12) to 9 is
a fall of 3 units.

Next, I\'ve seen several references here to present day Earth being TL 8.
Has anyone succeeded in building a grav vehicle, even a simple air/raft?
Has anyone yet got a working fusion power plant?  If the answers to those
questions are both "no", then on what grounds can present day Earth be
awarded a TL rating of 8?

Finally, a fall of 3 levels from TL 7 to TL 4 is not the same as a fall of
3 levels from TL C to TL 9, any more than it is the same as a fall from
TL 4 to TL 1.  Going from TL C to TL 9, you don\'t lose any really big
abilities, you just can\'t do things as well.  A TL 9 society can still
build starships, just not very good ones.  On the other hand, the drop of
3 levels from TL 9 to TL 6 would mean you lose all space travel.  The drop
from TL 7 to TL 4 also means you lose all space travel and almost all air
travel, as well as all computers.

That\'s where you\'re going wrong. Check HT page 19:

But that is a contradiction in terms. Think about the history of seafaring on
Earth. You can\'t have pirates without merchants to prey on, and you don\'t
have merchants unless trade is profitable. You only have pirates where trade
is profitable _in spite_ of the pirates. As long as they have a secure base
merchants will be out there trading. The problem comes if you have raiders
that can plunder and destroy the home community (in this case Terra). And as
I\'ve shown, the fleet that can challenge Earth is not a pirate fleet. And note
that I supposed a cut in fleet size of 99%. That\'s actually silly. We know
from examples all through history, up to and including today, that politicians
will allow their fellow citizens to starve sooner than cut defense spending.
As long as the pirates exists, Earth will maintain their fleet. Even if
trading become unprofitable. You don\'t need profits to maintain a military
fleet, just a not totally ruined economy.

But Earth by itself can maintain a fleet that can protect the first 10 or 20
worlds. And I\'m in complete agreement with Steve Higginbotham who say:

Nope. Military ships are a response to (percieved) threats. Profits dosen\'t
come into it, except insofar as somebody has to pay for the warships. Thus
profits will be welcomed by the government as a source of revenue, and since
they have the warships anyway, they will use them to protect trade. But
they\'d\'ve build the ships in any case.

Held out where? The pirate ships needs maintenance as much as any. Judging
from Hard Times they would be history in 5 to 10 years. Unless they based
themselves on a world with the technology to support them. But now they are
no longer just agents of destruction. However much they plague their sur-
roundings, they must at least help maintain their base planet. Even if they
manage to reduce every other world in the universe below jump capacity, their
own base must retain it. So now _they_ begin trading and empire-building.

Predators that outnumber the prey makes no sort of sense whatsoever (Which
makes me wonder where in h... all those 50.000 T vargr corsairs that overran
Corridor came from).

The average subsector in 1116 could support 132 trillion credit squadron\'s
worth of warships (or more propably 44 Sqs system defense boats, 44 Sqs
reserve fleet and 44 Sqs regular fleet). The average world population during
the Long Night would propably be lower, but even so...
Who\'s for a spot of piracy? Count me out.

>The TMC fail and Terra and \'the local community\' (say 5 pc radius)

The worlds from Barnard to Forlorn and from Sirius to Dismal. Meshan
and (strangely enough) Agidda isn\'t included. (Strange because Aggida
is only two jump-2s from Terra and relatively far from Dingir.)

This makes much more sense, and is in fact the way I\'d interpret the Long
Night and implement Hard Times. The polities will not fade away. They will
become a multitude of tiny trade spheres surrounded by Outlands where pirates
roam. Inside the polities bulk trade will be possible. Luxury trade between
polities will exist, plagued by pirates but still profitable enough for
adventurous merchants to attempt. Pirates will be based in friendly polities.
Raiding of polity frontier planets may occur, but any high-population world
will be too tough to touch.

I\'d really like to know how much of your paraphrase is your interpretation and
how much is GDW revisions. I found a second-hand _Alien Module 6: Solomani_
yesterday and bought it (there\'s been a mix-up with _Cats&Rats_ and I\'ve no
guarantee that my shop will manage to get it before it\'s sold out. Sigh!). It
tells the following about The Terran Merchantile [sic] Community and the Old
Earth Union: The TMC was a loose trade association formed by Terra and her
closest colonies under The Rule of Man that later grew into a corporation.
Ostensibly a purely commercial organisation, it was actually a means of
circumventing RoM prohibitions against member planets having their own navies.
The TMC built a merchant fleet that toed a very fine line between commercial
ships and naval vessels. The ships carried enough armament to protect
themselves from pirates and raiders, but not enough to classify them as naval
vessels. Their merchant fleet made Terra and her fellow worlds in the TMC
a formidable commercial force.
    When the Rule of Man collapsed, The Terran Mercantile Community had a
space fleet to patrol it\'s systems and to replace the now gone Second
Empire fleets. The TMC\'s merchant fleet cushioned the blow of the Long
Night and made it possible for Terra to survive in relative comfort.
    Well into the Long Night, the Terran Mercantile Community took over
political responsibilities and became an interstellar government  -  the
Old Earth Union.

This seems to be contradicted by the dates given:

        -1776   Collapse of Rule of Man.
        -1690   TMC established.
        -1110   Old Earth Union created.

But I think I can reconcile them. -1776 is an arbitrary date. Obviously the
RoM Rim government on Dingir held on for several centuries after losing
contact with Hub, keeping the peace and enforcing RoM regulations regardless
(Incidentally, _Solomani_ states that the Rim lost contact with Hub about
80 years before -1776). Thus the TMC was established to circumvent RoM
regulations a century after the RoM is said to have collapsed. In fact,
the Dingir RoM must have survived (at least in name) until -1110 (this
fits with another statement in _Solomani_ to the effect that the Easter
Concord and the Dingir League emerged at about that time).

The answer is that Hard Times dosen\'t provide standards to work
out how the worlds of the Domain is affected by the hard times.
I still maintain that the Aslans would not nuke planets in the
Domain, despite what Scott Kellogg writes about Aslan and nukes:

>Just a quick point:

True. I hadn\'t thought about that. That makes nuking just as
plausible as biowar weapons. Would _you_ nuke a planetful of
humans and then settle your family on it for the retaliatory
strike to crisp? Or would you confidently expect the humans to
be reasonable about it and not nuke innocent females and cubs?

OK, I\'m going to try to clarify the analysis I did on the Imperium last
week, but first I have some more data to throw into the mix.

The Feb 1992 issue of Railfan and Railroad has an article on the Duluth,
Missabe, and Iron Range railroad.  The DM&IR has been around (in one form
or another) for over 100 years, and makes its living doing one thing: hauling
iron ore down from the Minnesota mountains (the Missabe and Iron Range mountains
to be exact) to the Lake Superior ore docks at Duluth and Two Harbors.  In its
worst year (1932, during the Great Depression) the DM&IR carried 1,500,000 tons
of ore.  Ten years later, in 1942, its peak wartime haulage was 42,788,199
tons.  The all-time high occurred in 1953, during the post-war boom, and was
a record 49,317,625 tons of ore.  Current traffic is around 20,000,000 tons.
Iron ore (at first, soft iron ore; but recently taconite pellets) is a good
bit more dense than the MegaTraveller "average" of 1 ton per cubic meter.

Assuming a number of mines, a good mining planet should be able to produce
ore exports of this magnitude (let\'s say about a million tons a week).  Most
planets would probably pre-process the ore to some degree (taconite pellets
are the end-result of pre-processing low-grade iron ore; the DM&IR\'s
customers started shipping this when the soft iron ore played out in the 
late 50\'s and 60\'s).  Assuming that taconite is about two metric tons
to the cubic meter (and I actually have no idea what its density is), then
about 80 of my "standard" shiploads are generated each week for the ore
trade.

Now to get on to those questions.  First off, what about my starport
traffic breakdowns?  In particular, why do Class A ports handle so much of
the load?  Isn\'t the major distinction between a Class A and B port the
presence of starship building capability?

Well, yes.  The difference between a Class A and a Class B port is, by
definition, that the A port can build starships and the B cannot.  However,
we need to answer the question "Why doesn\'t every TL-9+ planet have a
starship construction capability?  After all, they have the technical
knowledge".  In the vast majority of cases, the answer has to be that it is
not economically feasable; in other words, such a yard would not make a 
profit, given the expense of setting up and running one.  OK, so why can\'t
it make a profit?  Because there is a low demand for new ships.  One good
reason for this is that the yard is far enough off of the most important
and heavilly travelled trade lanes to make buyers hesitate.

Reversing the above argument, starship construction facilities are located
where the demand for new ships is highest.  Since I assumed that 90% of the
demand for new ships is to replace old ships, it follows that the highest
demand is where the largest numbers of ships are.  The largest number of
ships is likely to be at major producers or consumers of goods (generally
high population, high tech worlds) or at trade junction points, where
long-distance trade converges or crosses.

Therefore, Class A ports probably have the highest trade activity, too.

The logic for Class B ports is similar; they are located where the demand for
starship overhauls is high, but where the demand for new ships is not as
high.  These worlds are probably on trade routes, or are important enough
that many ships call, but not as much as the Class A ports.

Class B ports are ones that "almost" make Class A, but for some factor.
Trade activity is high, but not as high as that around a Class A port.

I decided that Class C ports were "average" (and this category probably
exhibits the largest variation in trade level of any of the categories).
Not enought traffic to justify construction of Class B or A shipyards, but
enough trade that all of the basics are present.

As Class B ports are to Class A, so are Class D to Class C.  For one reason
or another, these ports just don\'t measure up.

Class E are substandard; presumably there is not enough trade to justify the
expense of installing anything but the most minimal of facilities.  Remeber
that a Class E port is as low as it can get and still be considered a
functional port.

Class X indicates no port present.  I probably set the traffic level way too
high.  Alternatively, you can assume that these ships are "just passing
through" on their way to another destination, and have stopped for wilderness
refueling or as a midpoing layover on a double jump.

You can play around with the numbers; I think I provided enough information
that anyone can set some trade percentages and come up with some new traffic
levels.  The major point to remember is that Starports exist to support a
level of trade; they will be as large and comprehensive (and expensive) as
the customer base can support.

It bears pointing out that the levels of trade vary dramatically from one
region to another.  For example, the Solomani Rim sector has 25% of the
starship construction capacity in mapped space.  Old Expanses is next with
14%, while the Spinward Marches is somewhere around the middle with 2%.
Zarushag is at the bottom with 0.12%.  For reference, Core is about even with
the Marches (2%) while Vland is slightly better (3%), and Deneb is near the
bottom with 0.35%.  The tech level distribution also varies widely; although
the Massilia sector has only 4% of the starship construction capacity, it has
35% of the TL-16 Class A ports.

The Imperial tax rate came from some information given in Striker Book 2.
On page 38, it mentions that "The average expenditure of a nation or world
on its military is 3% of its GNP", and later mentioned that "On Imperial
worlds, roughly 30% of the total military budget goes to the Imperium for
maintenance of the Imperial military".  From my feelings about the way
the Imperium worked, I decided that the Imperial budget was mainly 
defense spending, and created a budget accordingly.  I *DID* warn you that
it was made up out entirely out of my own head, didn\'t I?  I got the 1% figure
from 0.9% (military spending; actually 0.8856% as of the last budget) and 
about 0.1% (non-military programs; actually 0.1144% in the budget).

"Local Credits" were converted to "Imperial Standard Credits" using the table
on page 39 of Striker (a matrix of TL and Starport type; no, I\'m not going
to type it in right now, its already late).  Imperial Credits were assumed to
be based on a TL-15, Port A standard.

The Gross Planetary Products were created using the same rules (Page 38 of
Striker Book 2).  A base per-capita GPP is given (2kCr at TL-5, +2kCr per
TL over TL-5) on a table, and multiplied by the population of the world.
Six multipliers applied, depending on the trade status of the world (for
example, multiply the GPP of "Rich" worlds by 1.6).

In general, I thought the GPP rules to be reasonable.  The taxation rule is
a little over-simplified, but not bad.  If these rules are ever revised,
more multipliers might not be a bad idea, and taxation modifiers for
government type would also be a good ting.

The starport capacity figures are taken from Trillion Credit Squadron, where
they were created for an entirely different purpose.  (Actually, I am quite
shure that the TCS starport capacity figures were never meant to apply to
civillian shipping, and are *QUITE*WRONG* the way I have used them).  On the
other hand, they are also the only things available.

A table is given of government types and multipliers.  To figure the port
capacity, multiply the world population by the multiplier, and divide by
1000 (TCS, page 33).

On the other hand, I believe the construction time table given on the same
page is probably still accurate.

By the way, the analysis I originally posted, along with three statistical
abstracts of the data I used (basic frequency tables, sector statistics, and
starport/tech breakdowns) are currently stored in files here in my account.
Given these files, just about anyone with a spreadsheet program could do the
kind of speculation I have been doing.

Unfortunately, I do not have FTP access from here.  Does anybody want to 
have me E-Mail them there, so you can put them up on a FTP server?

  I got the UPP for Earth Now straight from the Traveller Book. I don\'t have
anything else but Hard Times and S&A with me now, but the conversion charts 
in 3G^3 talks about \'caseless ammo\' and simple laser weapons as the top of
the tech at TravellerTL 8.

  As for the lack of anti-grav, it is well known that the Solomani is lacking
in that area:) Both old \'Robots\' and S&A mentions that Solomani gravitics fall
one or more TLs behind.

  As Hans pointed out to me, worlds in Safe areas suffer no effects from the
Hard Times that can be noticed on their UWP. Therefore most of the Marches
will hardly notice it.

Despite current discussion, I don\'t think that the old information about the
Old Earth Union (OEU) and the new are contradictory.  The impression I get
from the new material (S&A) is this:

During the 2nd Empire, Earth operated a trade alliance called the Terran
Mercantile Community.  When the ROM fell, this alliance evolved into a local
government to take its place, by about -1690.  The TMC was able to continue
much as it had during the ROM, trading with its neighbors, and defending
itself from occasional piratical raids.  This government included many, if
not most, of the original Terran Confederation member worlds at first.

Gradually, isolationism and introspection caused the TMC to deteriorate.
Terra and her neighbors concentrated their interests on the subsector level.
When the TMC broke up in -1110, several new, more local governments took
*its* place, among them the OEU, Dingir League, and Easter Concord, centered
around HiPop worlds that maintained interstellar technology.

Note that, while piracy might have been a contributing factor to the end of
the TMC, I don\'t think it was the *primary* factor.  The Reaver\'s era ended
shortly BEFORE the end of the TMC, and Reaver attacks seem to have
concentrated on fringe worlds that had lost interstellar technology.  Note
that the Reaver states were governments that had retained this technology
and in some cases, their recolonization of devastated worlds may have actually
preserved knowlege from a world which was doomed before -- those that were
easy pickings for them.  I think that it was economic depression that was the
primary factor in this deterioration, and a trend toward isolationism, and
a shift to intraplanetary trade due to the expense of interplanetary trade.

Why did the Terrans abandon all settlements except for the Earth-Moon area?
I don\'t know.  I think that might be slightly incorrect.  Most outer colonies
probably weren\'t worth the trouble of defending, or maintaining.  A refining
station in orbit around Jupiter, might, but it wouldn\'t exactly be a colony.
The Belt would, but mining was also going on at Luna, which was much closer
to the manufacturing stations.  Again, Belt operations might not require a
permanent colony anyway, at least at the level which the Terran economy
was operating at.  Independent, transient mining vessels could move out, find
a rock, and tow it safely home for processing.

However, Luna was being developed.  Marc Miller wrote an article on Luna a
few years back when he mentions that the Plato settlement, I believe, held
its atmosphere in with a gravitic dome that had been operating continuously
built during the Long Night!  Now that\'s impressive.  There was still good work
going on at Terra, just at a smaller scale and in a more insular fashion.

Anyway, I just wanted to add my two bits worth to this discussion.

The obliteration of Aki still confuses me...the ihatei can\'t be that stupid,
can they?  How will the colonists there ever be able to trade peacefully with
their neighbors, unless they intend to commit xenocide on all their neighbors?
Besides, such an attack smacks of dishonorable tactics in any case -- the
prey never stood a chance of a fair fight.

The population pressure is there, though.  There are a few worlds in the 
Hierate that are very small in surface area and have populations pushing
the hundred billions mark -- I\'ve seen worlds at ninety, ninety-one billion
there.  What is the most crowded world anybody\'s seen, anyway?

  The piracy of Hard Times, or the Long Night, isn\'t a stable situation. It is
a dynamic story. A high number of \'loose cannons\' turn to piracy, leading to a
decline in commerce, leading to more loose cannons and less prey to feed them,
leading to more desperate pirates attacking a larger percentage of shipping,
leading to a decline in commerce and so on in an ever depressing spiral until
trade is gone and the pirates starve or get their own planets.

  I totally agree with you that piracy will be gone pretty soon after a
Night has fallen unless there is some commerce to feed it. This state will
probably be reached in a few years with Hard Times unless the pirates can
locate suitable bases where they can get maintainance. The importance of
fences and yards to pirates were analyzed rather nicely in "The Ecology of
Piracy on the Spinward Main" in an early JTAS. I think it was one of the 
Keiths that wrote that one.

  The Strephonian Imperium had reached a balance between merchants, navy and
pirates. Now that balance is gone and rampant piracy and such things are 
signs of an ecology that is looking for a new balance. There are however 
\'waterholes in the desert of ruined planets\' where pirates can survive on
the fringes and that is the small interstellar states. They will be much more
scarce because of the relatively low volume of shipping compared with the
old Imperium.

  That is what I think happened during the Long Night. The outer areas of 
ROM *and* the ex-Confederation were organized enough to provide maintainance
to pirates that pirated on other polities (aka letters of marque) to enable
the pirates to live through the dusk. Since the fall in Hard Times were so
much faster, the pirates will be gone faster too.

smaller and much less expensive. There is a simple was to recreate this in
Classic Traveller (and perhaps MT, if it doesn\'t have rules for it already)
which is taken (in modified form) from GURPS Space: for every three tech 
levels past introduction, a computer\'s cost and weight will be cut by one-half.
This means that a model/1 computer at TL15 is dirt cheap and incredibly small 
(Cr 250,000, and a volume of 1/8 ton (or about 1.69 cubic meters)). In 
actuality, the reduction in size and cost should decrease even faster, but if
it were halved at EVERY tech-level, the model/1 would cost a whopping Cr 1953
and have a volume of 0.013 cubic meters! If desired, the mass (or cost) could
be held constant, and the cost (or mass) and proccessing ability varied. For
processing ability, double the capacity for every three additional TLs. 

As far as Earth\'s tech level being 8 or not, that might be based on the maximum
extent of our current abilities. Remember that each tech level encompasses a
large amount of time; it would not be unreasonable to assume that we are
at the beginning of TL 8 (some of the items at TL 8 we have, some we don\'t --
just because a world is listed at a certian TL doesn\'t mean that ALL the
sciences are at that level -- there is nothing to stop a planet from having

with TL12 personal weapons and armor -- each of which represents the peak
of the planet\'s development in each area).

IMO you cannot compare the Long Night and Hard Times. The absense of
malignant destruction of high-population worlds prior to the Long Night
makes for two radically different situations.

It is also my contention that a high-population world (of sufficiently
high (ie. spacefaring) tech level) can defend itself against anything
short of the fleet of another high-population world (or equivalent league
of medium-pop worlds). Thus any high-pop world that survives the war years
relatively intact will be the center of an island of civilization. Mind
you, the civilization may not be all that deep. Many polities will become
reaver states, preying on neighboring polities. But they will not fade away.
Some may fall by the wayside, but the others, those that caused them to
fail, will themselves be the stronger for it. Oh, here and there some
polities will be so equally matched that they will destroy each other,
but not everywhere. Not even in most places.

But unless those \'loose cannons\' are really, really huge, they won\'t be able
to touch the high-population worlds, nor the worlds closest to that HP world.

(The "deadly menace" of Indro the Lightless and his motley band of corsairs
and converted freetraders is completely ridiculous. If you define a patrol
as 5000 T worth of naval ships (more than a match for Indro\'s squadron), then
the worlds of Khavle and Pasdaruu subsectors can support approx. 9300 patrols
(something less than that if you convert local currency into Crimp (Credit,
Imperial) and insist on paying the patrols in Crimp). GDW has very little
sense of proportions wrt. interstellar communities.)

What\'s that? Where did those patrols come from? Note that I said support, not
build. How about some AWOL imperial squadrons? Otherwise, Westfir can build
900 400 T ships (or 130 patrols) in 28 weeks. That\'s two patrols for every
last world in the two subsectors, down to the most useless of them.

To resume: A HP world will be able to protect itself _and_ several trade
partners against anything short of a full fleet.

Now, there may be a few full fleets that have gone \'loose\'. It sounds very
plausible. Certainly desertion will not confine itself to the measly 1000 T
vessels that _Hard Times_ implies. But such a fleet would be painfully
concious of the need for repairs and overhauls. Such a fleet would IMO
loose no time in taking over (as opposed to plundering) a suitable world.
(Or several suitable worlds, in which case we have a ready-made polity).
>From there it may begin raiding neighbouring polities, making a deadly
nuisance of itself and possibly causing the destruction of them. But the
trade it\'s own world could then flourish under it\'s protection.

To conclude: The Imperium has fragmented, and there seems no way of putting
Humpty Dumpty together again. But there is a limit to how small the fragments
will become.

And we haven\'t even examined how the various Safes will excersise a restrain-
ing effect on piracy. If England could send it\'s fleets halfway across the
world to protect the East India and China trade, then the Duchy of Delphi (or
whatever Margaret calls it) can send it\'s fleets to protect the Khavle trade.

Note that that is all settlements in the Sol system. Terra

You wouldn\'t think so, would you? Btw. did they obliterate Aki? Wasn\'t that

even less sense. Try controlling 40 billion humans armed to tek 10 even if

True. I\'ve rechecked my calculations, and I have to retract my earlier
contention that the ihatei couldn\'t possibly be a threat to the Domain.
Not only could they be a huge threat, pontentially they could roll up the
Domain and carry it away.

The numbers involved in ihatei export is at the same time ridiculously small
and staggeringly huge. According to my calculations an aslan world can afford
to outfit 0.0027 % of it\'s population each year, or 0.08 % in 30 years. That\'s
_one twelfth of one percent_ of each generation. That can\'t provide any kind
of relief except psycological. Not that psycological relief isn\'t important.

But when you combine the ihatei fleets of 7000 aslan worlds you get quite
a lot. Figuring on one 10.000 T cruiser escort for each 50.000 T colony
transport, the naval vessels of one year\'s worth of ihatei works out as the
equivalent of 16.280 trillion credit squadrons!

An avarage subsector can support 132 TCRs (in my campaign I divide that into
1/3 for system defenses, 1/3 for reserve (subsector) fleets and 1/3 for
regular fleets, but let\'s say everything is regular fleets). The Domain
of Deneb contained approx. 25 subsectors before the troubles. That\'s
equivalent to 3300 TCRs. True, the regular ships would be superior to the
obsolescent ihatei ships, but 16.280 TCRs of obsolescent ships could roll
over that and leave nothing but a smear...

Fortunately not every ihatei ship would go to the Domain:

1) Over half of the hierate is further from the Domain that they are from
   the Hierate\'s rimward border and would go there instead.

2) Most ihatei ships are jump-3. The logistics of getting a J3 fleet across
   the J5 route of the Great Rift are horrendous. I guess that the clans
   that control the route have a lot of huge jump shuttles, but using them
   would cost money, so the ihatei that are more or less the same distance
   from the Domain and the rimward border would go for the border.

3) The ihatei near Reaver\'s Deep need no longer consider the Imperium a
   deterrent to settling there. I would suppose that the Aslan would be all
   over Reaver\'s Deep like a coat of paint! (And why dosen\'t that show on
   the _Hard Times_ maps?) That\'s another big chunk of ihatei that won\'t
   want to cross the Rift.

4) Once across the Rift the ihatei are closer to Beyond and Touchstone
   Sectors than to the Domain parts of Trojan Reach. And there is a 10-12
   parsec buffer zone between the Domain and the Aslan worlds in Trojan
   Reach. The Domain Fleet may have deterred the Aslan from settling
   there earlier, but now?

5) Building an ihatei fleet and sending it 50-100 parsecs away across a
   rift is wasteful. You\'ll never see it again, so you only get rid of one
   fleetload of ihatei. You could export many more if you just moved into
   the neighbouring system and started shuttling ihatei in. And of course
   your neighbour is in the same position. We know that all through the
   Long Night the Aslan clans were unable to cooperate and that they\'ve kept
   feuding ever since then. Any Lakht Aorlakht to the contrary notwithstand-
   ing, the Aslans are going to spend most of their strength fighting each
   other. And a good thing too. Otherwise, geometric progression being what
   it is, the entire Charted Space would be hip-deep in Aslans in another
   couple of thousand years.

With all these variables involved we can pretty much tailor the strength of
the ihatei to represent any level of threath to the Domain that we want.
(Especially as we\'re told that some ihatei fleets have been hanging around
for years). If we want the Aslans to conquer the rimward subsectors of the
Domain, then we can adjust the numbers accordingly. Except for one thing:
The Aslans are not a united people. Where the Domain forces are under a
unified command, the Aslan are split into 4000 clans (with subclans
rebelling to become new clans all the time  -  and there\'s another source
of Aslan weakening). Now, regardless of the number of ihatei, the Domain
can destroy the first dozen fleets. By then they may not be in a position
to do much about the next dozen, true. But what ihatei admiral is going to
allow the Lakht Aorlakht to make his fleet one of the first dozen? And the
first fleets _are_ going to be clobbered (A wise domain admiral will destroy
or capture the cruisers and escort the transports back across the border.
Then that fleet will be at a _huge_ disadvantage vis a vis other ihatei
fleets. What Aslan admiral is going to risk that?).

Well, perhaps if there were no alternative, the ihatei would be desperate
enough to try. But what\'s wrong with Beyond, Touchstone, Vanguard Reaches,
Iphigenaia, Fulani, Theron, Astron, Theta Borealis and points spinward?
There may be interstellar states there too, but surely not any worse than
a Domain that represents 25 subsectors?

Incidentally, can\'t you just see all those ihatei fleets meekly following
the directions of the Lakht Aorlakht? "OK, Admiral A, you go and invade
that Aslan-prime world, and you, Admiral B, you get this world with the
fluid oceans. Sorry, there aren\'t enough A-prime worlds to go around, but
I\'m sure you\'ll be satisfied with that one." :-)

Superficially plausible, but think about it a bit. You\'re the Domain admiral
in charge of the coreward border and these 50.000 T raiders starts to appear.
What do you do?

1) You dispose your available forces to protect your worlds. 50.000 T
   raiders won\'t attack small worlds, because there\'s simply not enough
   loot to satisfy the crew (or pay for the yearly maintenance). Nor
   will they attack HP worlds, because the planetary defenses would be
   too tough (look at the size of the Vargr border states. Most of them are
   no larger than half a subsector). And a Vargr state wouldn\'t let all
   it\'s ships go raiding at the same time. Because why? Because then the
   Vargr on their coreward side would raid _them_.

2) You put your spies to the task of finding out where what fleet is
   based. It\'s the old problem of refit and maintenance. 500 T corsairs
   can hide out anywhere. 5000 T raiders may be able to masquerade as
   merchant ships (at least with local connivance). But there are only
   so many places where you can overhaul a 50.000-tonner. And you can\'t
   hide it either, at least not when it\'s being overhauled.

3) You lodge formal protests with the governments of all the neighbouring
   Vargr worlds and inform them that you\'re holding them responsible for
   controlling any ships refitting in their shipyards. (Yes, I know that
   they can\'t. So what?)

4) You gather a fleet big enough to deal with the biggest single world
   in the adjacent Vargr subsectors. We\'re told that the rimward fleets
   were sent coreward to help, but that\'s really not necessesary. There
   are 12 sub-sectors in the Domain that dosen\'t border on any border.
   Let\'s take the regular fleets from them. That\'s 528 trillion credit
   squadrons, or the equivalent of the _full_ forces of 4 subsectors.

5) When the fleet is ready you take it for a tour of the neighbouring
   Vargr worlds that have supplied any raiders. You inform them that
   you don\'t like that and destroy their spaceyards. No need to get
   involved in messy ground operations. Spaceyards capable of dealing
   with 50.000 T ships are highly visible. Most of them are in orbit
   to boot.

6) Then you go home. (No you don\'t, come to think about it. You go on
   and re-integrates Corridor into the Domain. (And this time you
   rectify an inexplicable mistake of the early 3rd Imperium and
   grab all the worlds between the Great Rift and the Windhorn,
   instead of stopping at the coreward border of the Sectors ;-))

Result:

A) Any ships that survived the visit will need to go elsewhere to get
   their next refit. The worlds that didn\'t get their spaceyards
   squashed will need theirs to support their own ships, and they will
   not be enourmously willing to help raiders any more. So the Vargr
   fight it out and are to busy to bother the Domain.

B) The neighbouring Vargr raiders will see some lovely defenseless
   worlds fit for plundering and will go there instead of to the
   Domain.

Big fleets are just to identifiable and too tied to repair facilities
to be used for raiding anybody bigger than yourself. Think about what
happened to the Barbary States.

Happy Birthday HAL!

In honor of this momentous occasion, here is a series of robots I have
been pondering for a while.  Enjoy!

THE GENDROID SERIES	(General Purpose Android)

Need a temporary ship crew member?  For Sale or Lease, try a TSR
Gendroid.  Programs installed to your specifications.  User
freindly:  requires no experience to operate.  Reliable!
Dependable!  Easy maintainance!

Expertly skilled as you choose!  Expert pilot or expert medic.
Gunner, Engineer, Navigator and many other applications
available!

The robot is contoured as a human, but that is for more than just
aesthtic reasons:  It is to allow the robot the mobility of a
human being.  It can sit in a normal human operator\'s chair and
use normal human tools with no modifications.  It weighs no more
than a normal human being.  Some Mercenaries have even used them
in combat armor.  They have come into favor with some of the
megacorporations most notabley the Glisten based SIE as starship
crew.

TSR rentals were soon set up at nearly all class A and B
starports, and at many class C starports.

DESIGN
Gendroids are built to be able to operate human equipment with no
hinderances.  They are human sized, and light weight.  Though
they have no fancy sensors, they can use human equipment.  They
are capable of vaccum operation and when shipboard usually carry
an hours worth of oxygen in thier tanks for emergencies.  That
should be sufficient to allow them to refuel themselves for
extended vacuum operations.  Also they carry a power interface so
that they can plug into external power while sitting at a control
station.

Also, the robot has a short range radio for communication in
vacuum conditions.  (At battle stations)

A program interface allows the robot to switch application
programs in its CPU.  A small cargo bay can be stocked with
holocrystals of application programs, thus allowing the robot to
be multi-purpose.

The robot has human-like hands and can easily operate a human
control panel, however, a brain interface allows the robot to
directly link to the ship\'s controls.

HISTORY
Back when the line was introduced in 725, Tukera decided to
experiment with the series on a small scale to measure it\'s
reliablity for larger use.  The subsidy line Akerut was equipped
with Genroids as gunnery crew for some of its smaller ships. 
This was met with fierce resistance from the Unions who feared
for their jobs.  Because of this the project eventually had to be
abandoned.

Because of the loss of the contract, the company that designed
the Gendroids:  Con-Centers was forced into bankruptcy.  The
companies assets were bought up lock stock and barrel by
Naasirka.  Naasirka felt that the Gendroid series had promise,
but their sales approach had been flawed.

Con-Centers was reformed as a subsidy of Naasirka renamed TSR.
Temoprary Sophont Replacement.  At first TSR\'s primary buisness
came from rentals of the Gendroids when starship crews became
temporarily incapacitated.  When a ship\'s crew member was too
sick or hung over a Gendroid could be rented for reasonable terms
on a temporary basis.

Slowly, acceptcance came and the robots were seen not as a threat
to jobs, but a valuable tool.  Ship captains began to purchase
units as a backup for crew members.  Programs were made available
for them and with the units program interface a single unit could
alternate between being an expert pilot or an expert medic
capable of surgery.

`PERSONALITIES\'
The first Gendroids, the IB\'s, have only one synaptic unit and
are somewhat slow to learn and develop their skills.  Thus they
tend to remain low skilled.  The HA\'s learn somewhat faster than
their Low Autonomous cousins, but learning still progresses
slowly.  However, as the robots have been around for more than
200 years, some gendroids have advanced quite high in their level
of skill.  A gendroids programming can be lifted from one robot
and reinstalled in another.  Thus there are individuals which
have been running for more than 200 years.  Because the robots
run their emotion simulation programs alongside their expert
system programming, over time, the programs become mixed as the
synaptics rewrite their programs.  Thus the old individuals have
taken on distinct personalities.

Some of these individuals programs are for sale (at exorbitant
prices).  For instance there is a program known as Ralph
(pronounced \'Raif\') who is became operational 219 years ago and
has achieved a skill level of Pilot-6 and Ship Tactics-3.  An HA
series Gendroid can be programmed with Ralph\'s programs for 3MCr. 
Ralph has picked up a few peculiarities in his life and has a
distinct personality.  He has a tendancy to sing selections of
Gilbert & Sullivan, particularly when the ship is at battle
stations.  ("For I am the Pirate King!")  Ralph\'s programming
(and that of all the other `personalities\') is highly copy
protected.  There is a limited number of Ralphs.

Other personalities include
Fulton:  Engineer-8
Bob:  Medic-7
Sturm:  Navigator-6

TSR has been known to sell site licences for its expert programs.
But despite intense negotiation on the part of the Navy, Scouts,
and several Megacorperations, programs are available on a ship to
ship basis.  Site licenses for the `personalities\' are not for
sale.

GENDROIDS AROUND THE IMPERIUM
Sale of the units is much more common now and TSR has expanded
into all sectors of the Imperium and beyond.  Reception of the
Gendroids have been met with a variety of reactions.  In the
Solomani Rim, TSR offices were bombed, and the company had to
withdraw.  HAL Industries:  a subsidy of TSR has now sucessfully
moved into the Solomani Rim.  (It seems that the Society of
Soverinity of Man over Machine objected to the name of TSR and
reacted on the idea of even temporarily replacing a human)

In Reaver\'s Deep, another cultural problem arose due to the Aslan
influence on human cultures there.  It seems that the male
contouring of the robot was restricting the sale of application
programs.  No one would buy programs for a \'male\' robot for
\'female\' occupations.  Thus a different style of contouring was
made.  There are now \'male\' and \'female\' Gendroids.  There are
even some Aslan contoured robots available in the Hierate. 
Rumors of possible Vargr contoured robots are thus far unknown. 
It is uncertain how well the Gendroids would be accepted in Vargr
society.
- ----
Ref\'s notes:  For the cost of a \'personality\' take a basic
program set that will fit into the robot\'s CPU (Pilot-2, Ship
Tactics-1) and add to it as desired.  The increase of skills must
be made within reason.  For each skill level added the cost goes
up by 500,000 Cr.  Thus Ralph with 4 added levels of pilot and 2
of ship tactics would cost 3MCr.  The skills must have been able
to fit into the CPU originally.  If a robot is often using its
program interface to change the programs running, it will learn
MUCH slower as the synaptic units take time to learn.  Thus if
you want your robot to get itself from Pilot-4 to Pilot-5, taking
out the pilot program and shoving in a Medical program will
greatly inhibit this.

In the Spinward Marches there was a case recently where a
freighter shipowner, disgusted with the performance of his crew,
fired them all and bought an entire crew of Gendroids.  The
robots took to their individual work well, but the owner was the
only human aboard.  After nearly 2 years of operations, the owner
died, but the robotic crew failed to notice this.  They went on
about their business for quite some time before this was noticed. 
It seems that they had taken over all aspects of ship operation
before the owner died.
	When the bank holding the mortgage looked at the records,
they discoverd that the ship was making an increased profit and
kept the ship operating as is.  The ship now roams the Marches
with no living crew.

	The Gendroid robot has a CPU space of 18 for the use of
application programs.  Most often the robot will keep it\'s
emotion simulation program running.  It is included in the cost
of the robot.  This reduces the available program space to 16,
though it is easy to down load the emotion simulation program
this is not normally done primarily for aesthetic reasons.

Today is a day to celebrate computers and robots!  (Well yesterday was,
but who cares!)

I was looking around and found that the price of a cargo lifter is
REDICULOUS for what it does.  the damn thing costs 30,000Cr!
Here are some robots built for the same purpose with better
performance and they respond to voice or radio commands.
Each unit is capable of carrying 1 metric ton.
(better than a cargo lifter and about half the cost!)
They are capable of operation in vacuum if fuel tanks are loaded with
oxygen and hydrogen.

Please note there is not a lot of exess thrust (10 Kg)  They are SLOW
and I wouldn\'t use them with 1 ton loads in high winds!

Well, if they\'re going to change the definitions, then maybe we are TL 8.  Just
exactly what does mark a planet as being TL 8, as opposed to TL 7?  I always
thought it was the ability to build fusion plants and anti-grav.

And apparently they lag one or more TL\'s in power technology as well.  Come to
that, what operational simple laser weapons exist today on Earth?  I assume
this refers to hand-held laser weapons, because starship lasers are also
available at TL 7, according to High Guard and MT.  On the other hand ...

And in addition, we\'ve had hand computers for some time.  Apparently, a hand
computer is the equivalent of a Model/1 computer, and the Model/1 comes out
at TL 5.  I believe TL 5 is about the equivalent of WW2 times, and I\'m fairly
sure that a decent present-day hand-held computer can outperform any computer
built during or around WW2!

MT charges Cr1000 for a hand computer, and the planet which built it is TL 11.
I\'m not sure what Cr1000 translates to in dollars or pounds, but I am sure
that present-day Earth is not TL 11!

Here is an odd question.  I\'m just one curious about and am wondering
what others think.

It is a question of the fitting of battle dress and combat armor.  Does
armor have to be fitted to the individual?  It seems to me that someone
would have a lot of trouble fitting into someone elses battle dress.

It seems to me that it would be a difficult proposition to design a suit
to fit EVERYONE.

Actually, let me put this in the context in which it was originally
brought up:  Would there be different models of battle dress for sexes?

*I* have assumed so.  But when it came up recently, I was surprised when
someone disagreed with me.  In hearing a lecture by Dr. Kathy Sullivan (First
US female astronaut to space walk) I found that she had a great deal of
difficulty when they tried to put her into the \'male\' space suits.

No, I am not talking about relief tubes, I am referring to the fit of the
suit.  I seem to remember that there was difficulty matching the size of
the chest unit with the legs.  I seem to remember that one female astronaut
had trouble because she took the largest size chest unit, to fit into, but
then the sleeves were so long, her arms would only reach down to the forarms.

The problem was not restricted to the chest.  The size of the female hips
being statistically larger than male hips caused more problems.  A female
astronaut had difficulties because to fit into a unit.  She ended up with
a fit where (in order to accomodate her hips) the crotch of the pants was
down around the middle of her thighs.

I once had the experience of watching a woman of my height and
weight try to get into my clothes.  The result was quite amusing, but
suffice to say that it just did not work.

These to me seem significant design problems.  To my mind sufficient enough
to call for separate designs of armor for different sexes.  It seems to me
that the Aslan would Definitely have differing designs.  But I think it
would be necessary for humans too.

I know the GEnie wish list is pretty dead, but I hope some kind soul would

One last thing I would like to see in Traveller 3.  Some rules for the
construction of micro-electronics.  As is, it is impossible to build
any really small neato devices.

It is impossible to build a robot that is under 1 liter in displacement.
(whataDRAG!)  Now the only way to get something neat and small is to have
the ref just guess how much it would cost.  Some official guidelines
would really help a LOT!

Even if it is just a basic rule.
Like:  For every time the devices volume is divided by 2, the cost is
multiplied by 4.

Thus a device that originally takes up 8 liters and cost 1000 cr
would cost:
4000Cr if built at 4 liters,
16000Cr if built at 2 liters
etc. etc.

What do you guys think?

Yes. Given that the battle dress has a rigid shell it may be
possible to do somthing with internal padding, but male and
female versions would at least be necessary, as well as
different sizes. The battle dresses in _Starship Troopers_ are
individually fitted (I think it takes 150+ manhours to power up
a new suit  -  this would presumably include fitting.) Hmmm...
that\'s one way of crocking battle dresses that I hadn\'t thought
of before. Thanks.

Btw. I\'ve decided to include a new skill in marine character
generation (and perhaps army too?) called \'armourer\', and then
require armourer skill to care for high tech weapons (that is,
anything with electronic parts). A weapon skill would give a
default ability to field repair that particular weapon (possibly
electronics skill might too?), but proper maintenance and
especially proper repairs would require armorer skill.

What do you think?

Then, the wearer must be trained how to use the internal HUD/holo

wearing someone else\'s armor might not work. Roll 1d6 each for the person
trying to wear the armor, and for the armor/vacc suit itself. If the person\'s

unusually small/large for race, +2 to armor roll if person is of wrong sex than

(actually, it seems like there would have to be one for emergency vacc suits on

    'body' => 'Hi,
A few ramblings and points to add to various discussions going on
currently.

1. For all of the tonnage  stats based on Earth states, were the
tonnages for oil tankers excluded? For most Terran nations oil
imports(or exports) form a significant fraction of the total
tonnage. I doubt if a similar situation exists for Traveller worlds
unless the data represents total tonnage including insystem traffic
which for a significant part could be hydrogen fuel tankers
resupplying all starports. My understanding was that the numbers
were trying to represent intra-system or jump traffic (paralleling
intra-nation trade on Earth). I think a significant portion of the
imports for Bangladesh and US (tonnage wise) will be oil.
Especially considering the average displacement of an oil tanker vs
a container ship.

2. I would think that one of the reasons for joining the Imperium
for a planet would be reduced defense expenditures. What Striker
presents may represent independent worlds trying to build an
independent navy. Most worlds I would think who are deep in the
Imperium would see little need for a large indigenous Navy (pre-
Rebellion era). They would pay the 0.3% of GNP to Imperium and the
Imperium would pay them a portion to maintain extrality defenses
etc for starport. Thus there would be little need for local
investment in system defenses especially if you are far from the
border. 

3. I found Hard Times to be a very interesting product. Probably
the single best product to come out for MT. I found it lacking in
a couple of things. First of all it has absolutely nill value for
"new players" (something which GDW wants to attract). Secondly it
makes everything that GDW has put out so far for MT worthless. The
maps that are supposed to be a GM\'s aid are now worthless because
a GM has to find out for every world what the heck is really
happening. What are you supposed to do with the sector info on back
of Encyclopedia(never correct to begin with) or the alien modules.
Its aimed only at hard core Traveller players and even then it adds
little to improve the problems in MT and only adds additional rules
which most people find problematic to say the least.

4. Is it just me or are there other people out there who are
getting sick and tired of the gloom and doom setup in current
SFRPG. I think it started with Battletech and then Shadowrun. It
was great then because they stood out but now with the gloom and
disaster in every SFRPG I am kind of looking forward to something
that has a positive tone. Maybe the next version of Traveller
should be Traveller 3 : The Reconstruction (or the New Imperium!!).

5. Aslan invasions. First of all I agree that only with most
incredible luck and ability could the Aslans attack the Domain and
get to and CONQUER Glisten. However I found it even stranger that
the Commonality of Kedzudh (6-10 worlds pre Rebellion) has taken
over half of Aramis subsector. This subsector is adjacent to Regina
which is the home of the Archduke! Come on! As of 1120 they still
held it and the maps in Hard Times don\'t reflect a change.
According to some notes in Digest, this conquest was carried out by
only some fringe worlds of the commonality and not all of the
worlds are involved. Even more ludicrous! 

Hard to believe considering that the Sword Worlds and the Outworld
Coalition, which incidently was prepared for war, managed to only
take a fraction of the worlds from the "unprepared" forces in the
Domain. And I don\'t buy the FFW weakened defenses bit either. FFW
did not effect Aramis subsector local defenses or those of the
Trojan Reach. Yet we are to believe that Hi-Pop worlds with the
capability of defeating capitol Zho fleets or atleast crippling
them (using just system defenses) can\'t beat a motley fleet of some
Vargr worlds. 

6. Finally to Scott Kellog.... How much cargo do the cargo handlers
handle....???

  {
    'body' => 'After reading the last few issues of the TML all at once, I noticed that
the discussion has finally come around to the unreality of the Aslan and
Vargr "threat" to the Domain.  
 
1) the Vargr.  Face it.  The Vargr aren\'t a credible threat to anyone. 
A Vargr Navy needs bases just like the next guys do.  If operating that
far from your homeport were that easy in MT, then the Fifth Frontier War
would have included a lot of things that never happened (for instance -
Vargr raids in force (about 100,000 tons of warships) down around
Rhylanor, Regina, Glisten, and similar important worlds.  Instead
theyplayed around with a few nowhere places on the fringe, and never
even got to Efate.
Vargr raiders are a "threat" all right.  But to what?  A raider fleet of
100,000 aggregate tons could carry no more than about 20,000 men and
their equipment (tanks, APCs, artillery, food, medicine, etc.).  That
wouldn\'t even be a major threat to the USA today.  The threat to an
Imperial world with its share of 50-odd squadrons of cruisers and
battleriders would be trivial.
As pirates, the Vargr raiders should be a major threat to small ships in
isolated systems.  Since recent discussion here has indicated that 99%
of the shipping in the Imperium is bulk haulers, which, if armed, could
brush aside the average pirate effortlessly, I doubt the Vargr ability
to do more than annoy the Domain.
Besides, I doubt that the Vargr would be that excited about invading the
Imperium, when they know that old man Oberlindes would send the
"Emmissary" to give them a stern talking to.
 
2) the Aslan.  Has anyone ever done a detailed analysis of an assault
across the Rift against an enemy operating close to his own bases?  A
TL15 fleet is MUCH better than a TL13 fleet.  A TL16 fleet makes that
TL15 fleet look kind of sick.  The Domain can raise (under TCS
guidelines) somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 trillion credit
squadrons of TL16 warships (almost entirely from Vincennes/Deneb 1122).
That force alone should be worth 1500 squadrons of Ihatei.  The TL 15
squadrons from Glisten, Trin, Rhylanor, and Mora are worth 1000
squadrons.  All in all, the aslan are going to have a very hard time
subjugating any part of the Domain (unless they earn their land by
helping smash the Vargr to Coreward).
Admittedly, the Aslan have enough firepower to be a threat in spite of
the problems.  Assuming they can operate without bases for extended
periods.  There is no indication anywhere in MT that a ship can live
without a base for any period much beyond a year.  With the Aslan
baseworlds 20 parsecs away in the Reaches, they will spend so much time
shuttling back and forth for maintenance and repairs, that they won\'t
have time to be a real threat.
 
The real question for the Aslan is why anyone in their right mind would
go that far looking for land when most Aslan systems are NOWHERE NEAR
FILLED UP.  The Aslan systems include about the same fraction of High
Pop worlds as the Imperial sectors do.  So 92% of the Aslan systems have
LARGE amounts of extra space for the taking.  And they are all close by
to home.  Makes you wonder...
 
3)  The Sword WOrlds.  Now these guys could be a threat.  They can\'t
fight the Domain by themselves, but as a base of operations for either
Ihatei or Vargr fleets, they can\'t be beat.  And the Sword World fleets
are NOT trivial.  They have three High Pop worlds of their own, and can
maintain a fleet of 180+ trillion credit squadrons if they want to.  Not
nearly enough to fight the Imperium, but there is no Corridor Fleet to
bail them out this next time.  And they are still the perfect base for
raiders (Vargr, Ihatei, and others).  Right at the sector\'s jugular,
with enough rift in front of them to make defense a LITTLE easier.  They
could hold out a LOOOONG time.

I\'ve been away from my fast computer at a class since a week ago Monday, and
have therefore been pretty much \'read only\'...however, the question of Earth\'s
current TL is being tossed around, and I fear that I must step in and correct
a slight inaccuracy:

Both Fusion Power and Grav Units are TL 9 (nine).

This is a slight change from the air/raft description in Classic Trav (all
three versions), but has been in effect since Striker was released in 1981,
at least.  Thus, there is no inconsistency in stating that we are now at
TL 8 (eight).

Just setting the record straight,

Actually, your "emergency vacc suit" exists. They have them on the Space

TL of any item, anywhere.  Again, I\'d call that an 8 for some
exotic computer and weaponry systems.

So _my_ reading of Earth\'s TL is ~6 with some anomalies.
Or do the rules include building your civilization on the backs
of most of the population?

"A Scout crew, for example, would  take great intrest in whether
the "low-tech" planet they were investigating could intercept
them with a gun-armed ME-109, (sic) an F-12A multisonic

"Little Boy" and prop driven monoplanes.
	TL 6.1 would be 1945-50 and include "Fat Man", the first

	TL 6.2 is 1950-55, the first thermonuclear warheads, first

>From the Ref\'s handbook:
TL 4 =1900
TL 5 =1930
TL 6 =1950
TL 7 =1970
TL 8 =1990
TL 9 =2010

I personally disagree with the above.  In my opinion it
should be:
TL 4 =American Civil War
TL 5 =World War I
TL 6 =World War II through mid Korean War
TL 7 =Mid Korea up to mid Vietnam War
TL 8 =Late Vietnam war up to today

The whole point of this is that Tech level can be pretty vague
when you try to pin down \'This is TL 8\'.


A great deal of the vehicles I have put up are TL 8.  (I may even
have put out more Tech 8 stuff than the unbeatable Rob Dean!:-)
I have sort of been going by the design tables in the ref\'s
manual and COACC to define this as TL 8, but that is flawed too
if you look at what the designs say.  According to COACC the F-14
is a TL 8 aircraft (oops it was deployed in the early 70\'s!)
The A-6, the A-10, the Harrier, the B-52, the Boeing 747, and
many others are TL 8.  (The B-1 is TL 9) (sigh!)

The FLIR in current military aircraft is TL 8.  LADAR in current
tank technology is TL 8

No, I have\'nt seen any Spinal mount partical accelerators in the
world today, nor 250MW laser batteries, nor man portable laser
weapons that can kill.

But in my (ahem, considerable) experience in vehicle
construction, I have found that when I want to build a present
day vehicle, I need TL 8 to do it.  TL 7 just doesn\'t cut it.

Take a look back at the designs I have put out in this reguard:
Tank M-1A1 (TL-8)
Tank T-80 (TL-8)
Submarine SSN Los Angles Class (TL-8)
Submarine SSN Alfa (TL-8)
Submarine SSBN Typhoon (TL-8)
Fighter FA-18 Hornet (TL-8)
Carrier CVN Nimitz (TL-8)

These can\'t be built at TL-7

	(Look out he\'s getting on the soap box!)

The problem we are dealing with is that Traveller came out in \'79
and had the \'60\'s outlook of what technology was gonna do in the
next 10 years.  Look at all the predictions that have gone wrong:

UFO said SHADO would have a base on the moon in 1980.

Buck Rogers was supposed to have left Earth in 1987.

Remember 2001?  we thought we were gonna have HAL in operation
last sunday!  January 12th 1992!

The Robinson family was supposed to be lifting off from earth in
1997.

Space:1999 had a base on the moon.
(Ok, 2001, and UFO are the only good science fiction listed
above, but I don\'t care!)

The point is that back when Trav came out, we thought technology
was gonna go alot faster than it did.  (We also thought that the
economy would keep us going at the rate we did!)  Let\'s face it,
technology is not progressing at the rate it did back then.  Some
of our top of the line fighter aircraft are 15-20 years old.  We
went from P-51 mustangs to Tri-sonic aircraft in that amount of
time! GEEZ!

Well, anyway, We are at the low end of TL 8, and have been for
about 10+ years.  No we don\'t have fusion, no we don\'t have
antigrav, but take a look at the ref\'s manual, those aren\'t TL 8
any more!  When Trav first came out, they were, but then the
plasma physicists said \'20 more years folks\' and MegaTrav made it
TL 9.

Fade out grumbling...

Armorer Skill
Well, I would say that an NCO with Battle Dress-2 should be able to fit
and adjust armor to a person.  After all, normal military training would
require that a person be able to strip, clean, maintain, etc etc their
suit at Battle Dress-1.  Battle Dress-2 should allow you to follow cookbook
instructions on how to adjust the suit.  Battle Dress-3 should allow you
to be an expert at customization.  Thus I would oppose introducing an
Armorer skill.  (For heaven\'s sake it\'s tough enough to get battle dress
skill in the first place!  Why make maintainance even HARDER on the players?)

Aslan Battle Dress
Nick pointed out that Battle Dress is a male only skill for Aslan.
True, but what about Combat Armor?  I would imagine it would be a similar
situation to what we have for arming troops today:  The enlisted carry
rifles, while the officer carries a pistol.  Thus, in Aslan battle dress
forces, the males wear battle dress, while the females would wear combat
armor.

If so, then there would have to be male and female models of combat armor.
Probably, they would be distinctive designs, so that a male would know who
it was honorable to shoot.

Human battle dress
I guess, that if you look at imperial battle dress, then concievably all
(physical) customization would require would be remove some of the internal
padding in some places and put more padding in others.  After all, Imperials
have quite a few minor human races to deal with, so finding a \'neutral\'
fitting that can be modified would be desirable for battle dress designers.
Minor human races seem to vary a great deal, thus I can imagine you\'d have
do make the suit fairly modular so that you can adjust it to fit.

Solomani suits are probably going to be similar.

The Zhodani, on the other hand have fewer minor races to deal with.  Their
suits are probably going to be more geared toward the Zho normal.  Also,
their chest unit seems to be a lot more articulated than that of the
Imperial suit.  This suggests a rather tight fit.  Thus I think there is
going to Have to be different types for male and female.

Fitting into alien vacc suits
There is a bit in the back of Adv 12, secret of the ancients on humans trying
to fit into an ancient droyne vac suit. (shimmer suit?)  Difficult!  wrong
number fingers!  Wrong shape feet!  The legs go the wrong way for humans.
Same goes for Aslan suits (but if you roll boxcars?  Who knows?)

Cargo lifter capacity:
1 metric ton.  (slightly better than the standard lifter and half the cost.)
The Lifters I made and the standard ones are exactly the same size (400 liters)
But they are just pallets.  You can put as big a pile on it as you want, as
long as it weighs less than 1 ton.

Actually, World Builder\'s Handbook addressed this point.  If your planet\'s
best starport is an A and you live on a high population world, it is extremely
likely that there are a couple of other A class facilities on the planet, as
well as several B and maybe C class, and most airports will count as an F or
G class spaceport as well.

Actually, the point of my question was this:

Hard Times establishes (for the first time) a firm set of rules regarding the
minimum tech level to maintain a planet under various adverse environmental
conditions.

All I wanted to know was how many planets were below the "minimum tech level"
in the standard Spinward Marches data, since each one would need a little
explanation, either of how it was dealing with its decline, or how it was
managing to sustain its population.

So, my question didn\'t directly deal with Hard Times.

Well, don\'t both Marines and Army have several entries for "Mechanical"
and "Electronic" in the charts?  I\'d be inclined to keep things simple <?>
and say that repairs/fitting etc. of battledress required someone with
a reasonable level of both skills.  Avoid unneeded skill specialization!

It didn\'t say, since it was a just a summary chart.  I would agree that most
trade would not be of bulk materials in most circumstances.  In fact, I\'d
think that we should look at the trade on the basis of most planets being
90-95% self-sufficient, with the imports being divided between critical
technology (military, power, communication) and luxuries (Coca-cola, video
games, hand carved statuettes of walrus ivory...)

Seriously, no.  Not for a game with the average detail level of the skills
is what we already have.  Ask a pilot (like Scott Kellogg) if he thinks that
we should split aircraft pilot up by plane type...I don\'t think that it is
worth splitting Engineer up into Jump Drive Engineer, Maneuver Engineer and
Power Plant Engineer either.

I don\'t believe that a suit *has* to be fitted for each individual.
I will ammend this statement shortly, but I would like to justify it
with something I learned on a recent trip to the Marshall Space
Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama -- they have a pretty neat space
history museum there. The space suits that were manufactured for the
Mercury program had each suit custom manufactured for each astronaut.
They made casts of each astronaut in toto. However, with current
technology, this is no longer necessary for the Shuttle astronauts.
They manufacture each part of a space suit in a variety od sizes.
Each astronaut is measured -- "size 7 glove, see bin 17; size 38
chest, see bin 22; size 34 waist with 31 inseam, see bin 49," etc.
Once they have all the pieces together, they take some final
measurements and do some tailoring. Also, I\'m assuming that it is
impossible for a person with noticable differences in build to wear
to suit of someone else (height, weight, extra arms, whatever).

Now for my ammendment. As long as the person had at least the proper
components gathered, they would be able to wear the suit in at least
(and at most) a little comfort. For battledress, assembling the inner
suit will be this easy. However, they are also intended for extended
wear in unusual and harsh environments. This would mean more than simple
tailoring, but not much more. Also, I believe that a majority of the
time needed to build one of these monstrosities is adapting the
electronics, built-in power and weapons systems, and hardening the
suit (wouldn\'t do well to have a stray 22 round cause the power
plant to go up). This is also where the cost is.

I like it. Perhaps 2 skills: one for weapons and one for armour, or
one for personal weapons and armor and another for crew/vehicle
weapons and armor?

    'body' => 'Oops, better make that Battle Dress...

Battle Dress, depending on how you conceptually look at it, could be the
easiest or the hardest to crossfit. I\'m not sure what MT says about it, but
I basically take the view that Battle Dress is the ultimate form of an armored
exoskeleton (in GURPS Space, for example, the first varieties of powered armor
are powered exoskeletons married to an armored vacc suit -- such a combination
is ugly and clumsy, but it is a primitive form of Battle Dress). At each TL
past introduction (I would put the armored exoskeleton at TL8), the exoskeleton
becomes lighter and faster. The armor of the suit improves with lighter and 
stronger materials coming out, and new electronic toys are added for combat.
Eventually, it becomes a gracefull and deadly weapon. Now, following this
evolution, Battle Dress would be easy to crossmatch. Its more like driving a 
car than wearing a suit of plate armor. Still, one suit of battle dress won\'t
fit everyone, but it will cover a wide range of body sizes. Also, custom
fitting doesn\'t make sense, to a point; why spend nearly a quarter of a million
credits on armor that only one person can wear without major modification? It
simply isn\'t cost efficient (whether for the Third Imperium in it\'s peak, fall,
or for the early Fourth Imperium). I know this goes against what I said about
battle dress in last night\'s post, and I apologize for that; I just had to
think on the topic a little longer.

Combat armor, unlike battle dress, needs to fit more precisely, since it is
more like old body armor. However, as someone pointed out (though perhaps not
regarding combat armor), you could make the combat armor in a piece-meal 
fashion. For example, the stormtrooper armor in Star Wars (not a very effective
version of combat armor, though) consists of about 20 or so individual sections
which interlock over a black thermal body suit to form a complete protective
suit. A person could wear combat armor fitted for someone else, but it would
probably not be very comfortable. However, as combat armor is fairly cheap with
regards to battle dress (1/10th, I think), such limitations would not be as
bad.

The emergency vacc suit I had in mind was one with arms, legs, and a head, one
that you could actually walk (waddle?) in. A vaccum-safe version of a survival
bubble is okay, but somtimes not adequate. 

With regards to a special skill with regards to repairing battle dress: don\'t
do it! Aside from the specific weapon skills in old Traveller (before the days
of Mercenary and High Guard), I can think of no other really specific skills.
In a game like Traveller where characters tend to get a very few general skills
for their age, it seems contrary to the spirit of the game to use specialized
skills. A combination of mechanic, electronic, and perhaps the battle dress
skill at some minus (-1 or -2) would do. You could even use the \'repair
defaults from weapon\' idea -- it seems plausable that someone with Combat
Rifleman-5 would be able to do at least rudementary repairs on a damaged rifle.
Also, from a game balance view (I hate to use arguments like this...),
characters get very few skills -- forcing them to be specialists will tend to
make characters useless for most situations they face (anyone rememebr the old
\'walking medic\' stereotype of clerics in AD&D, where they were only trotted out
if someone needs to be healed or if undead needed to be turned?). General
skills keep the players involved more, because it means that each character
will be useful more often.

there are different suits for different genders.  However, in order to 
actually wear the thing and move around in it, it had to be fitted to
you, a process taking about eight hours for someone with battledress
skill, and rather longer if you are fitting yourself.  Both the outer 
armor and the inner skeleton are adjustable in length for each piece,
(including torso, and each section of each limb) and in diameter in 
several places.  The different sizes of battledress reflect the largest
and smallest sizes they can handle.  All this assumes someone of normal 
build - anyone very obese would probably have to get custom-made 
battledress.  Once the battledress is fitted, the different parts 
lock and the armor cannot change, for example, armlength by accident.

As for the one-size-fits-all vacc suits, the one size doesn\'t fit anybody 
very well, and at lower tech levels is achieved by a variety of adjustable
straps on the outside of the suit.

  I\'d interpret the WBH TL as overall 8 and low common 4. It is mentioned in 
an example (or maybe that was in Grand Cencus?) that it is very possible for
the median TL to be lower than the overall TL and that is what the \'lowest
common TL\' is for.

  I think we have forgot the TL aspect in this discussion. I ran this kind
of action as the \'Battle of Naasakiira\' Naasakiira (Corridor 1309 C556687-9 Ag 
Ni 623 Vg K7 V). I computed the number of ships the Naasakiira would have 
built for themselves and the ground-based installations, at the percentages 
given in \'Striker\'. Against them, I put a force of 6 5000 vargr battalions of
TL 13 troops, 10 7000t ships and 20 800t corvettes. All in all a 150 to 1 
advantage in manpower (whole population against whole vargr force plus crew).
  I realize that this isn\'t the correct way of calculating the relative 
strength, but it might give some indication of the size of forces needed to 
take a small world. 
  In any case, without TL15 help, it would have been a walkover. The orbital
forces of the planet had 100% losses in the first 20 minute round. They and the
ground to space batteries had a hard time getting close to hitting the enemy,
and when they did the damage was medium. Meanwhile the enemy pounded the 
batteries with everything they had. I admit that I was biased in favour of
the defenders here: The attackers did only marginal damage against the batteries
but their objective was to get the swarms of gravcarriers to low orbit, 
where they could travel down on own power and destroy the batteries in close 
combat. If I had let them use the meson-guns against the surface batteries
according to the TL-firecontrol rules any TL15 help wouldn\'t have matteret
one bit.
  Down on the ground the situation were worse: The only weapon the defenders 
had that could penetrate the enemy gravcarriers were their tankguns and missiles
while the secondary armament of the attackers cut through all the defenders 
vehicles.
  Extending the example, I\'d bet that a force of 250,000 could take on a planet
of 40,000,000 if they have a 4 tl advantage and take it with low to nonexistant
losses. They could possibly handle a 120,000,000 planet after a fight.

  The very high GNP figures for planets cuts both ways: It gives the planet a 
big defence and it gives the raiders a big booty.

  I thought that this raiding buisness was the decsision of the individual
ships totally without regards to what their gov said. The governments then
made a virtue of a necessity when they claimed sovereignity of the looted
territory.

  We can see what skill-o-mania does to a game by studying Rollmaster. It is
questionable if the increase in unplayability is matched by an increase in
quality and realism. 

  BTW: Making it equally hard to get basic combat skills and some academic 
skills isn\'t very realistic either, but it is a tradeoff Traveller has made.

Traveller Book talks about the players being "blaster out of the sky" if they
tries to take off without permission.

I admit that I never worked out any battles like this, so I hadn\'t given
tech level differences much thought. But if they really are that important,
then that should work against the Vargr in general. Some Vargr may be able
to gain a local advantage once in a while, but since the average Vargr tech
level is lower than the average Imperial (the typical Vargr raiders shown in
_Rebellion_ are TL 11!), so much the worse for them. That means that the navy
needn\'t try to achieve parity with the raiders, but can distribute their tech
15 ships on more worlds. Give Naasakiira a brace of Azhantis and where would
your invader fleet have been? And how many Azhantis could the sub-sector that
Naasakiira is in afford? More than two per planet I\'d guess.

Well, don\'t you think the citizens of Naasakiira realizes this? So don\'t you
think they would have bought tech 13-15 defenses from a nearby world? Even
if they have to import technicians to maintain them?

Still, I\'m not saying that the Vargr couldn\'t mess up some planets if they
got lucky. But then what? They can\'t stay, because the relief fleet will
kick their ass if they do, and they can\'t go home, because the vengeance
(sorry, deterrent) fleet will kick their ass there if they do. Actually,
they propably do go home, and they may even escape the destruction of
their home planet\'s spaceyards, but whatever happens they won\'t use that
planet as a base any more. Pretty soon they\'ll run out of places to get
repaired and maintained. Then no more raiding. And they most certainly
won\'t conquer (as in move in and stay) any Domain planets. By 1118 at the
latest the frontier will be back to normal. That\'s assuming the Vargr got
so excited over the news about the Rebellion that they lost enough sense
to start anything in the first place (Which, I grant you, is extremely
likely).

Well maybe. I think that any Vargr raider with any sense at all will keep
on the good side of the people who controls the spaceyard he needs to keep
his ship flying, but then who said that Vargr raiders had any sense?

You mean, they don\'t control the looted planets at all? Just what I think

Why not? The 2nd and 3rd Empire and the Solomani Confederation did it. I
could even give you an argument about how hostile they would be against a
power that could protect them against those incessant raids from their
naighbors, but actually I was just being sardonic about the way the 3rd
Empire stopped at the top of Corridor and Vland Sectors. The area above
is old 1st and 2nd Empire territory. Why stop precisely there? Ah well,
something to do with the treaty with the Julian League, I suppose. But I
still think it\'s odd.

They used to be corsair havens until they got trounced and forced to stop
being corsair havens.

We\'ve got different ideas about what a particular skill level means (mind
you, yours may be nearer GDWs intentions than mine). I use this rule of thumb:

0: You can use it, albeit badly.
1: You can use it adequately in routine situations.
2: You can use it well; you know what makes it tick.
3: You can make it tick.
4: You can make it tick real well.
5: You can make it tick "The Star Spangled Banner". ;-)

I don\'t want my players to use battle dress more than absolutely necessary.
A battle dress is WAY too powerful for many situations. And you can\'t just
beef up the opposition. There is no middle ground against a battle dress.
Anything that can take out a BD will also take out the player character
inside. I don\'t want to be in a situation where I either has to let the
players walk all over my senario or kill them...

I suppose I could invent an ECM beamer or something...

Eh? Isn\'t that just what MegaTraveller does? And don\'t you think there\'s

No, because any starship engineer needs to know about all three systems. But
I don\'t think a brigde builder should be allowed inside a starship engine
room. For that matter, I don\'t think a Wet Navy Navigator has any business
inside a starship control room, for all he knows a skill called navigation
(actually, I\'ve renamed starship navigation \'astrogation\' and use \'navigation\'
only for the Wet Navy skill).

    'body' => 'I have returned to my office after an eight day course on Project Planning 
and Control.  During the course, I had plenty of time to sit and think 
about other things, primarily Traveller, and specifically Striker.

I wrote down about seven pages in my "go everywhere" notebook on a variety 
of topics, which I will reproduce here in more or less the order they came 
up.  Trying to sort this would be a problem.

Last summer, I started a discussion of future ground warfare that went on 
for several weeks, and the need for infantry in general warfare at TL15 was 
vigorously debated.  I decided to look at the question from the other side, 
in terms of what TL15 infantry would have available to them under the 
current rules (and the Striker rules) and whether it would be useful. 

The TL15 Infantry Squad: Would potentially consist of men with battledress, 
suit radio and perhaps maser communicators, an active EMS system of 5km or 
better range, and armed with a mixture of PGMP-14s and FGMP-15s.  Presuma-
bly gauss rifle, laser rifle, and grenade launcher units could be added as 
necessary, if you were anticipating a situation in which flaming things 
with a fusion gun was going to be inappropriate.  The trouble is that a 
fusion gun only has a penetration of 34 at effective range, and its effec-
tive range is only 450m.  For comparison, a TL13 4cm RAM grenade has an 
effective range of 370m with a HEAT penetration of 38 (and an extreme range 
that is about the same as the fusion gun, with a HEAT penetration of 38, 
where the fusion gun drops off to a penetration of 4).  Since the fusion 
gun and its power pack cost a total of Cr700,000, and a RAM grenade costs 
Cr20, there may be a little problem in our usual TL15 infantry concept. 
With TL15 battledress having an armor value of 18, and with the rules set 
up so that a penetration advantage of +8 is almost a sure kill, lower tech 
infantrymen with grenade launchers will give the TL15 battledress user a 
bit of a rough time. The only advantages the fusion gun has is that it 
won\'t run out of ammunition, and its shots can\'t be engaged by point de-
fense weapons as RAM grenades can be. The battledress user also has the 
problem of not having a weapon which will damage a \'tank\'.  A little exper-
imentation shows that tanks with all-around armor values of 65-75 are not 
difficult to design, and can have acceptably high performance values de-
spite their high cost.  We\'ve generally assumed that the infantry will 
carry missiles to give them a chance against tanks, but the best possible 
penetration value that can be achieved by any sort of projectile in the 
Striker weapon design system is 59.  This means that tanks that are com-
pletely invulnerable to man portable weapons are quite practical.  The 
situation doesn\'t look good for battledress--too many things can kill you, 
and you can\'t kill enough of them to make it cost effective.

Drone missiles and vehicles:  Infantry could control drone missiles and 
drone vehicles, but a drone vehicle with a large  energy weapon might as 
well be manned, since the men are likely to be cheaper than the drone 
brain, and the drone missile is limited to a maximum penetration value of 
59, as mentioned above.  Infantry that was using drones would presumably 
require maser communicators and computer support to maintain contact with 
the drones.  Since maser is limited to line of sight, I suppose that heavi-
ly protected relay drones would also be part of the inventory.

Communications:  I have this feeling at the back of my mind that jam-free 
communications capability is going to have a noticeable effect on tactics 
in the Traveller universe.  After thinking about it for a while, I decided 
that it might be possible to jam tight beam communications by blanketing 
the receiving unit with \'white noise\' across the appropriate spectrum, but 
this would probably require a line of sight and a fairly precise targeting 
system.  If you\'ve gotten that far, you might as well fire a weapon at the 
thing and be done with it.  (Hard kill beats soft kill in current U.S. Army 
jargon any day of the week.)

Scenario Planning for Striker:  This looks like a real problem.  I was 
thinking about it from the point of view of running something like a Vargr 
or pirate raid on a low population planet from start (arrival insystem of 
the raider spacecraft) through the raiding force jumping back out.  Before 
this game could be developed, some sort of \'air support\' rules for ships in 
orbit would be needed.  After all, a planet could potentially launch a lot 
of missiles at an intruding spacecraft, and tanks with energy weapons, 
particularly lasers, could presumably engage in some sort of reasonably 
effective fire against spacecraft.  It seems to me like an \'armor value\' or 
\'hit modification\' or something would need to be worked out for handling 
the effect of large layers of atmosphere on this sort of fire, and it would 
be necessary to decide whether to resolve it on the Striker system or the 
Mayday system tables.  In any case, Striker envisions a table covering 
about 1km by 3km, which can be a real problem when many vehicles are capa-
ble of speeds of 8-10km per 30 second combat turn.

Space Combat:  As part of this thinking, I started considering how to run 
the space combat section, which would come first, after all.  For the 
really picky, it should be noted that one can set either the hex size or 
the turn length for space combat if you want to use a Mayday-like system, 
but not both.  20 minutes works out to 14000km per hex, and the 25000km 
hexes recommended by the Referee\'s Manual corresponds to about 26 minutes 
per turn.  At the 14000/20 scale, the moon would be about 30 hexes from the 
earth, and would have an orbital speed of 1 hex per 12 turns.  Safe jump 
distance from earth would be 48 hexes.  After space combat was resolved, 
ground defenses would need to be considered.  

Planetary Defense:  We all know from our reading that huge meson guns are 
the main planetary defense system when these are available.  I wonder if it 
is possible to triangulate the position of these things in some way with 
meson screens?  In any case, lower population/lower resource/ lower tech 
level planets would have to make do with things like lasers and missiles.  
Lasers would be fairly easy to handle in Mayday.  The installations could 
be treated as turrets, and only damaged if a turret was hit on the damage 
distribution roll.  Ground installations would automatically have an agili-
ty of 0, although I suppose they might benefit from a computer modifier 
representing various sorts of electronic countermeasures.  The power plants 
could be attacked separately, and I imagine that most sites would have 
back-up power available and/or be able to draw from the commercial electri-
cal grid.  In some more backward locations, power plants for the defense 
lasers would be a very valuable commercial and industrial resource, and 
there would probably be a tendency for governments to divert their power 
for other uses.  In Striker terms, these laser sites could be almost arbi-
trarily heavily armored.  Still, missiles would be even less vulnerable, 
since they could be dispersed in one shot package launchers (silos).  I\'d 
want to add missile design to the system, since it seems like planetary 
defense missiles in silos would not necessarily be restricted to a 50kg 
maximum mass.  Large missiles could be designed with some combination of 
the Special Supplement: Missiles, Robot, and Referee\'s Manual vehicle 
rules, and the cost of launchers worked out from Striker.  Control sites 
for either type of defenses might be dispersed, automated or hardened.  
Striker mentions ground based meson screens.  I\'ll have a go at figuring 
out what sort of power consumption these might have some time be using the 
dimensions of a spherical ship as an approximation.

Atmosphere: Consider the following for Mayday scale.  Shooting through an 
atmosphere has a \'to hit\' modifier of +0 for vacuum/trace, +1 for very 
thin, +2 for thin, +3 for standard and +4 for dense.  This would apply in 
both directions to laser, plasma and fusion fire.

Ship Lasers:  It\'s always bothered me that all ship lasers are of the same 
energy consumption.  Chuck Gannon mentions adding small laser to ships for 
ground defense or whatever in the article on TL9 starships in Challenge 55, 
which seems plausible as far as it goes.  I\'d like to see smaller lasers 
usable as point defense systems in space too, and suggest that you allow 
100MW lasers to be substituted for 250MW lasers in turrets as a quick fix.  
Such weapons would be restricted to firing at close range (later) or at 
missiles, using either the Ref\'s Manual/High Guard system or the Mayday 
system.

Missiles:  If you are using Ref\'s Manual influenced Mayday, which allows 
missiles to be in flight for several turns, it would be reasonable to allow 
(as in basic Mayday) missiles to be fired at before impact.  I\'d add a 
\'missile\' sized category to the Ref\'s Manual DefDMs, of +3, for anything 
less than 1 displacement ton.  Missiles would not ordinarily be allowed a 
computer based defensive DM, but might be allowed one if they were in 
constant communication with their launching ship.  This, in conjunction 
with the communicator channels rules (or a modification that is more real-
istic) from the Referee\'s Companion would allow a natural limit to be 
placed on missile fire to get around the "1 shot per 20 minutes" problem we 
see now.  Command control missiles guided by the launching ship would be 
limited by comm channels, and self guided missiles not carrying their own 
computers would be more vulnerable to enemy point defenses.  I like systems 
with some sort of built in tradeoffs...

Striker to MT Conversions: One of MTs problems with the way they converted 
Striker is that energy weapons and fire control systems got better--too 
much better. Striker also had a very generous optional rule for firing at 
evading air targets.  Since this could cover grav tanks, I had a look at it 
with respect to the infamous "Phalanx" battlefield fire support vehicle.  
The Phalanx would be eligible for an evasion modifier on the \'to hit\' roll 
of about -15.  This would mean that at effective range (8+ to hit) a mini-
mum modifier of +11 would be needed to attack it.  High rate of fire might 
be worth +5 or so, and an elite gunner could add another +3.  Without any 
further rules, however, it is quite simple in Striker to come up with a 
vehicle which _cannot_ be hit (making its armor level irrelevant, eh?).  
Using the Ref\'s manual design system additions, I\'d insert a rule here that 
allowed a starship sized computer to add a plus to the \'to hit\' roll. The 
Phalanx\'s Model 7 would be useful here, since it would give two evading 
Phalanxes some sort of chance to hit each other with rapid fire weapons and 
good gunners.

I think I\'ll cut things off here for the day.  Tomorrow\'s installment will 
include some thoughts about reworking Mayday as the small scale ship combat 
system.

Good Gaming,

Rob Dean

Actually, I\'m left with the impression that Aslan honor doesn\'t automatically
extend to anyone who isn\'t Aslan.  I think it was the old Aliens 1: Aslan
module that mentioned that the Aslan/human wars in the Solomani Rim region
got out of hand because the Aslan viewed the humans as fighting without rules--
so their retstrained \'laws of war\' didn\'t apply.  In fact, I was rather 
dismayed to read about some Imperial ambassador who arranged a proper \'by the
rules\' Aslan-style clan war to settle the fate of disputed areas (in Dark 
Nebula sector), because that removed a lot of excuses that could be used to
explain the current situation.  (Things like escaltion getting out of hand
due to humans not acting \'Aslan-like\' enough--may still wrok, but now depends
on a higher level of stupidity among the humans.)

More on Aslan soon...

Now that I think about it some more, I agree with Rob.  Honor wouldn\'t 
apply to dishonorable opponents.  It still seems foolish to commit genocide
on an enemy planet when one day your colonists may want to trade with the
neighbors -- or defend themselvs from them.  It looks like the former
Imperials had better learn how to be honorable again, FAST!

True enough.  I\'ve been using out-of-date, TL7 manuals for reference.  No
doubt, in a few years when we do have fusion power plants, GDW will change
things again and make grav units TL 10.  :-)

So when and where can I buy a laser carbine?

this is available.

If noone has an extra copy to sell, I would appreciate it if
someone could make a copy ---- I will gladly reimburse them for
any reasonable amount.

Thanks!

     As readers of old issues of Aviation Week & Space Technology may know,
the U.S. military has been playing around with lasers and particle weapons 
for years.  Back in the early 70\'s sometime the Navy was researching ship-
mounted particle weapons for point defense -- and then someone came along
and showed how you could do a better job with phased array radar and a 
very high rate-of-fire gun --> Phalanx.  The U.S. Army once looked at 
lasers as anti-tank weapons; and we all know about SDI lasers and particle
beams (i.e, "whadda you mean they don\'t have laser batteries!" as the 
detonation laser vaporizes your powerplant...).  Except for SDI, the
energy weapons programs have either been abandoned because, (a) as Classic
Traveller originally proposed, slug-throwers and explosive warheads are
far more cost-effective and efficient, or (b) have disappeared under a
layer of secrecy because they really are getting somewhere...
     I also note the existance of surgical lasers first used in the late
70\'s for removing cancer, etc. that literally vaporize the offending
tissue.
The problem with man-portable laser weapons has never been the laser, but
the battery for the damn thing...  And we could probably solve that problem
if we wanted to -- but bullets are cheaper and just as deadly, so why
bother?
     As far as I can tell, we (the so-called First World countries) are
quite definitely in the TL8 range.  Just because we toyed with a technology
and then decided not to build it because of economic or political reasons
does not mean that we CAN\'T build it...  The first (and last) working
NERVA (== Hard Times\' Nuclear thermal Rocket) was built in the early 60\'s
by
the U.S. Air Force..

It sounds like the World Builder\'s Handbook began to address this problem.  On
a high traffic world though, it seems like there should be dozens, if not 
scores, of auxiliary landing facilities.

I don\'t think that I\'d allow Vincennes to have it\'s full supply of ships
at TL 16. For one thing it\'ll take some time (minimum 10 years) from the
time they converted their starship production to tech 16 to replace their
old tech 15 fleet. For another, no TL 16 planet in my universe is more
than borderline TL 16. I might allow them to have a prototype TL 16 courier
(and in my universe you can build a J7 engine at TL 16 ;-), but not an
entire fleet.

Which is such a lovely idea that I\'m kinda sad that the Vargr really
isn\'t any threat. Perhaps we can use the idea that Imperial citizens
pay relatively less tax than citizens of small states to make the
Domain fleet smaller?

It does indeed. And I just checked the maps: There are _no_ aslan world on
the trailing side of the Great Rift that is not closer to Reaver\'s Deep
than to the Domain. And that\'s even if you just count the crossing as
ordinary space...

I know I have a copy of book 8.  I\'m not so sure about 101 Robots,
though.  However mine is trashed, because I naively believed GDW
would use that format forever, and cut all my little books up,
put holes in them, and stuffed them into notebooks (with notes,
of course).   Write to Mark Cook (markc@hpcvss.cv.hp.com) for
the address or an order form for the Weekend Warrior in LA.  It\'s
a nifty little game store that specializes in out-of-print stuff.
Let me know if you run into problems.

Gagarin class Orbiter TL8

     The Gagarin class (named after a legendary Solomani space explorer) is a 
single stage to orbit launch vehicle with an additional capability for deep-
space missions of up to a couple of AUs.  A Gagarin is capable of lifting off 
from any human-inhabitable world with a full cargo load of up to 200 tons.  
With plans widely available from the Imperial Bureau of Standards as an IDP, 
Gagarins are becoming more common on backwater planets which are interested 
in retaining a native spaceflight capability in the current imperial diffi-
culties.

Perseus Galactic Arm got me to thinking about where some real interstellar
structures should be in the Traveller universe.  Five Imperial sectors are
named after real stars, after all (Spica, Fornast, Alpha CRU, Deneb, and 
Antares).  Ever wonder what the sky might look like from, say, Vland? 
Regina?  Using an old copy of _Norton\'s Star Atlas_, I went on a trip to
Vland.  (Of course, in terms of the Traveller chronology, this is like
using an Egyptian chart from 1800 B.C., but oh well.)

Vland is fortunate enough to have two very bright stars in its sky.  Located
about seventy parsecs away from Vland is the M1Ib red supergiant the Vilani
call Mika, known to Terrans as Antares.  Seen from Vland, Antares has an
apparent magnitude of about -0.5, which if it were that bright in the Terran
sky, would make it their third brightest star.  More impressive still is
Deneb, only 65 parsecs away.  Deneb shines at the incredible apparent
magnitude of -3.1, four and a half times brighter than Terra\'s brightest
star.  Tourists from Mora won\'t be impressed.  From Mora (21 pcs.), Deneb
has an apparent magnitude of -5.6, two times brighter than *Venus* from
Earth, and probably visible far into daylight hours!

Unless you brought your PRIS binoculars, don\'t plan to find Terra from
Vland.  Sirius, the brightest star in Terra\'s sky, shines at a apparent
mag. of +7.8.  Think "Neptune".  Sol, at a range of 200 parsecs, is an
eleventh magnitude star.  Usually, people can only see down to the sixth
magnitude or so with the naked eye.

- ----

In WBH, they say that supergiants should be rare.  They are!  I have
only found three others beyond Deneb and Antares so far. The three:
  Eakhoi    (2123 Dark Nebula)  F8 Ia
  Sardas    (0839 Mendan)       F0 Ib  M7 D
  ??????    (1530 Empty Qtr.)   M4 Ia  M4 D
Rare enough?  This is in the whole region of the Imperial Atlas!
Of course, whether these stars are real or which they are is another
question altogether....

I also have a request for the "old-style" Traveller players out there.
Remember that old map of Charted Space with the star field background?
Traveller Deluxe and "Library Data A-M" had copies of it.  I don\'t have
a copy myself, but I remember that it showed some bright star names on
it, as well as a few nebulae.  It would be interesting to know where
(what sector, roughly what part) some of these nebulae were placed.
For instance, do we know what Dark Nebula the sector of that name is
named after, according to Traveller?  I\'m putting together a list of
stars/systems that I\'ve seen referred to in sector library data, and will
post it if anybody is interested.

Incidentally, I haven\'t been able to find Spica, Alpha Crucis, or Fornast
yet (although I haven\'t looked for Fornast much), so if anyone has a hex
coordinate for them, I\'d appreciate it.  For owners of "Solomani Rim":
what subsector of Alpha Crucis was named "Denebola"?  Any help with this
would be appreciated!

Looking at the figures for probability of  misjumps  (Starship  Operators
Manual)  ,  I was wondering how the many small starships ever got someone
to agree to finance them ? 

The problem is this :

Given that a commercial starship will average about  2  jumps  per  month
over  it\'s 40 year repayment period, it will have made about one thousand
jumps by the time it\'s paid off.

Assuming it has a skilled engineer  and  doesn\'t  miss  any  maintenance,
etc,  it  will need to roll for a possible misjump only about one jump in
thirty-six (roll 2 \'1\'s on 2d6). This gives about 28 possible mishaps. 

A  major  mishap, which is what is needed for a misjump, will occur about
one time in twelve (roll 11+ on 2d6 ).  This  works  out  as  around  2.3
actual misjumps per thousand. 

Assuming (from a guess at how many hexes have systems in them ) a  chance
of  something  under  50%  of  emerging  from  jumpspace  close enough to
somewhere to get rescued, etc, you get 1.5 unrecoverable misjumps per  40
years of ship life. 

Clearly,  the  Mega -corporate  bulk freighters, and large military ships
will be able to carry small, jump-capable lifeboats, but a 100t scout  or
a 200t merchant just won\'t have the space. 

The  question  is,  then, who\'s going to finance a starship that will, on
average,  be lost without trace one and a half  times  before  it\'s  paid
for ? 

This  all  depends  on  whether  you  want  jumps  to allow you to arrive
anywhere, even in deep space, or  if  you  prefer  jump  drives  to  only
operate  between  star  -systems, as has been suggested. If this isn\'t to
be the case, or if it doesn\'t hold true for misjumps, then there will  be
a  *lot*  of lost starships drifting in deep space, with almost no chance
of even the most long-term, detailed search ever locating any of  them  -
Great  idea  for  adventurers finding a 200-year old lost freighter, etc,
but really bad for interstellar free traders. 

I never really liked the idea of 40 -year  loans  anyway.  As  the  rules
stand,  you  can either go bankrupt carrying other peoples goods, or make
vast sums  on  a  few  profitable  routes,  with  little  middle  ground.
Changing  to  a  d-20 in new Traveller,  or whatever, is going to totally
mess up any kind of probabilitys, as you\'ll have as much chance  of  a  1
as  a  20.  If  they  don\'t fix the rest of the rules on trade,  starship
operations, and anything  else  that\'s  long -term,  it  won\'t  be  worth
travelling by car, let alone starship ! 

Next - Jump torpedo\'s :It seems they\'re indispensable, so how about...
And  - Why you don\'t need maneuver drives to move or be agile !
plus - Robot Drop-Tanks ?

And, since GDW have changed the definition of TL 8, I now agree that it is.
(TL 8 means superconductors, which we do have.  It no longer means fusion
power and anti-grav, which we do not.)

Well ... I\'d say that prop driven monoplanes are TL 5, because they were
around in WW 1.  The Junkers F1, which came out in 1918, even had a metal
skin, thus winning the 1918 award for worst-timed innovation - a metal
fighter at a time when Germany was short of metal.  To me, TL 6 means jets,
and TL 6.0 means jets like the He 178 and Gloster Whittle.

Agreed, with the exception that TL 6.1 means the first operational jets,
e.g. Me 262, Meteor and Shooting Star.

I\'d say that WW1 marked the transition from TL 4 to TL 5, and WW 2 marked the
transition from TL 5 to TL 6.  Wars are great things for improving technology!

The B-1 _looks_ TL 9, too!  But calling the B-52 TL 8 - that really shows
how much the definition of TL 8 has changed.  :-)

There was an article in a gun magazine some years ago about a laser rifle.
It caused quite a stir, to the point where the U.K. government got worried
because existing firearms legislation didn\'t cover something which didn\'t
fire a solid projectile.

Unfortunately, it turned out to be just an April Fool\'s hoax on the part of
the magazine!

As for particle accelerators and big lasers, I expect they are possible,
if someone put up the money.  It\'s small lasers that are the problem -
there is just no way today to have a portable power source which can put
out enough power to supply a laser weapon which can do more than blind
someone if it hits them square in the eye.

You think that\'s bad.  We\'ve only recently finally got round to replacing
our Shackleton AEW aircraft, four-engined propellor types with radar going
back to WW2.

First, on the subject of battledress, I don\'t think that extra skills
is a good idea.  If you need to, make Mechanical and/or Electronic
cascade skills.  In addition, I don\'t see anything wrong with having
Mech/Elec - 2 and Battledress -2 and being able to repair the 
equipment (I\'m not sure if Mech or Elec would be more appropriate.)
If someone has experience fixing Howitzers and knows how an assault
rifle works (fires one well) I\'d trust him to fix it even if he
hasn\'t done such a thing before.  He has the knowledge and technique,
just not the experience.  While this is not entirely accurate, it\'s
a fair fix for a relatively simple RPG system.

Also, as far as fitting goes, I think the modular fitting idea is
just fine.  Save your measurements next time you\'re fitted for a
tux and send them in to your local Battle Dress manufacturer.  Also,
is it so difficult to believe that at TL 12+ a very expensive 
piece of clothing (battledress) could alter itself somewhat to
compensate for personal differences?  Nanotechnology or materials
that can be fitted easily and then rigidified (new word)?  

Also, WRT anti-matter missiles, I assume these are anti-matter
warheads and not a means of supplying power.  If the TL level
for a power source is the TL at which it can be used as a weapon,
then fusion is TL 6 and we\'ve had it for the better part of 4
decades.  I could believe that anti-matter as a power source
would follow more quickly then the rules would have us believe, 
maybe 4 TL\'s after a system\'s introduction as a weapon.  Then 
anti-matter would show up at TL 13, which isn\'t unreasonable.

Someone mentioned that many of the worlds in the Hierate seem to have plenty
of room for population expansion.  Perhaps.  However, remember the male
Aslan\'s drive for land?  Most of those areas in the inner Hierate will have
been claimed already, even if the actual land is still relatively unpopulated.
Those little worlds with populations in the 90 billion range are *seriously*
overpopulated from an Aslan point of view!

I agree, an attack on Reaver\'s Deep by the ihatei would make sense, if it
is taken as given that it makes sense they are attacking the Domain of 
Deneb.  But that ritual battle that settled the Aslan/Human Wars was fought
in the area, and perhaps the clans in the area are unwilling to cast that
treaty away lightly.  Deneb was never confronted by the Aslan, so if it is
no longer part of the Reaver\'s Deep area\'s government, it doesn\'t qualify
for protection (in some Aslans\' eyes, anyway).  Different clans, different
policies....

Steve, according the the sector archives (from GEnie) Denebola is
subsector L.  The entire sector looks like this:

    Alpha Crucis:
                A      Ximenes  C         D
                E      F        Orichalc  H

                M      N        O         Ziusudra

As you can see, only 4 of the subsectors have been named.

Definitely post your list, when it\'s done.

How difficult is it for a non-astronomy literate person (me) to determine
where *real* stars are w/ respect to the Imperium (or specific locations
therein)?  I have a need (for the about-to-restart) TML PBEM to be able
to tell PCs where certain recognizable (i.e. bright or unusual) stellar
objects are in respect to their own location.  (Unfortunately, I can\'t
go into any more detail without spoiling the plot!)

I\'m afraid I don\'t see that at all.  Our outlook on technology has
changed, true.  But it\'s been more of a shift of effort into different
areas.  For instance, computer technology.  Immeasurable bandwidth
has been consumed here and elsewhere about how we didn\'t expect the
personal computer revolution, how it left technology watchers with
their pants down and so on.  If one extrapolates, I\'m sure your Hewlett-
Packard Snake workstation, MIPS R4000-based machine, or the like blows
away comparable computers listed for TL8.  With new display technologies
and (cross fingers) voice recognition we could build the TL11 \'Computer,
Hand\' with a non-holographic DDRH within 10 or 15 years.  The increasing
portability of telephones, laser printers, scanners, facsimile machines
and the like make their Traveller equivalents look almost silly.
 
What I\'m driving at is that in the past ten or fifteen years things have
changed differently than the designers of Traveller thought they would.
When Mr Miller started this, words like \'cyberpunk\' and \'nanotechnology\'
hadn\'t been coined yet, many of the innovations of the Xerox PARC and the
MIT AI Lab had not been so promulgated, and the Japanese just made cars.
 
A few deprived individuals reading this may be running UUCP software
at home or at work on a small computer that may run at only one to five
VAX Units of Processing Speed and less than four MBytes of memory.
But most of the readers are on boxen on the net that in all likelyhood
have at least 8 megabytes of memory.  How much did that cost in 1973?
The only reliable figure I have for that time is for Honeywell Level 6
minicomputer\'s 16 Kword (32 Kbyte) memory board.  It used 4kx1 DRAM chips,
which were (almost) new then.  It cost $10,000 retail, $2000 to manufacture.
Using this figure, eight megabytes would half a million dollars just to
produce.  With markup, a cool $2,500,000.  This included the decoding and
refresh logic, unlike the average piece of memory sold today.
But one must admit that we\'ve come a long way when you can go to your
local computer store and buy a $150 4 Mbyte memory module that takes less
than 1/20th the board area.  Then consider the processors, the hard disk
drives (gone from a 2 Mbyte pizza-box sized platter to 2.4 GByte 5.25"
form-factor boxes), the network hardware (in 1980 the \'experts\' said
Ethernet would never work), and on down the line.
 
We don\'t have the jet fighters with the capabilities foretold by the
SR-71, the XB-70, the F-14.  We don\'t have a space station (sorry, Mir),
a lunar base.  But we could build them if the public called for them.
HAL was not born this year, true.  Neither was Robbie the Robot.  But
there are projects that may soon produce them. (Cyc, for instance.)
Sure, we don\'t have fusion, weather control, grav tech.  Cold fusion
(don\'t laugh) may yet produce answers: there are researchers at a liberal
arts college in Maryland that believe they have found a non-nuclear and
non-chemical explanation for the excess heat.  And British researchers
just fired off a test which produced the first controlled fusion event.
 
They didn\'t lie; no-one\'s crystal ball is without a flaw.  In some ways,
we\'re doing better than anyone had dreamed.  In others, we\'re behind.
But we\'re getting there.  Doomsayers have prophesied for the past ten
years that we\'re about to run out of improvements to silicon.  They\'ve
also said that we would run out of room to expand, not to mention blow
up the world.  Now they say we\'ve irrevocably poisoned this planet.
And progress continues.
 
I\'d say we\'re TL 8 in most respects.  But we are not straight TL 8 by
any means.  That\'s not to say that _we\'re_ wrong.  Rather, either the
scale should be redefined, or split into its component parts.  Or both.
And I don\'t think that the fact that we don\'t have grav control is a
fault of ours.  The game designers were just a little overly optimistic.
 
Be patient.  We\'re getting there.

It makes a lot more sense than an attack on the Domain. A few
of the most powerful clans might actually have a chance to get
something out of an attack on Reaver\'s Deep.

Plausible, but that still dosen\'t remove the objection of the
Domain being too tough a nut for any single clan to handle (and
that\'s before we even explore the possibility of allying with
some Aslan clans against other Aslan clans  -  a very real
possibility according to what we\'ve been told about Aslans).
The crucial problem remains: Who goes first?

The mecha from Battletech are a little bit better than those of Japanese
animation, from a reality standpoint. However, unlike the creators of
Battletech, I don\'t really ever see mecha being much of a combat factor. They
are slower than tanks of the same tonnage (usually) and cost too much more 
than a tank. The only real advantage they have is mobility. However, when
grav vehicles come in, this is cancelled out (granted, a grav vehicle
is even MORE expensive, but it makes ground-contact vehicles very vulnerable).
Really, mecha are good at about TL8-9, in light tonnages (5-25), serving
as scouts, recon, and highly mobile fire support for ground troops.

Skill Levels and their meanings (In my book)
(Using Ground Car as an example)
Ground Car-0	(Know how to drive, fill the tank, when to get routine
		maintainance, knows when car is malfunctioning.)
Ground Car-1	Can Drive in bad weather, diagnose of minor faults, can
		perform minor maintainance: change oil & filters
Ground Car-2	Can Drive in bad weather at speed.  Perform most maintainance
Ground Car-3	Professional Racer.  Can overhaul engine & transmission.
Ground Car-4	A.J. Foyt

(Using Hand gun)
Hand Gun-0	Can point the gun and shoot it.  Knows how to reload
Hand Gun-1	Can strip and reassemble it under battle field conditions
Hand Gun-2	Can strip weapon & reassemble blind folded
Hand Gun-3	Competition level marksman
Hand Gun-4	Olympic level marksman
(Please note, I am Ground Car-1, and Hand Gun-0.)
I have no military training what so ever.  But it appears that the average
guy who goes though boot camp learns an awful lot about guns.  And initial
training in Trav is Rifle-1.  Any body with more experience in this please
speak up.

It herefore seems to me that Battle Dress-1, would give the user a damn
good knowlege of the system that is there to keep him ALIVE.  Marines
would be sleeping in the things in boot camp.  Probably the best thing
on the subject of training in battledress is in Joe Haldeman\'s "The
Forever War".  Now it seems to me that a drill sargent ought to be able
to fix his men up in this stuff.  His skill levels would be around
Battle Dress-2 or 3.   (I would guess)

The system is gonna have to be easy to customize if you have the proper
tools.  I don\'t think the Imperial Army is going to be expecting its troops
to be geniuses...  So, as (Somebody who\'s name escapes me) suggested, it
is probably going to be an affair of different sized components.
	(Different hand size, different arm size...)
Differing hip and chest units for different sexes.  After all, different
relief tubes will have to be installed, and differing padding may be needed.
	Problem!  This idea of different sizes runs contrary to the spirit
of published stuff.  In The Spinward Marches Campaign, the characters come
across containerized suits of Battle Dress and are allowed to use them if
they can.  Well, I don\'t know what to think really...  Maybe they are built
with sufficient variability of size that an experienced person can alter them
to size.  (That is my best guess)
	So, looking at the above, one might have to have a skill level of
at least Battle Dress-1 or 2 to look at another person in battle dress and
know if it is a woman or not.

Richard:
I do use a spreadsheet I built up with Lotus 1-2-3, unfortunately, it is a
major mess to use.  I can use it becaue I know how it works.  But, trying
to give it to someone else would be difficult.  To explain how it works
would take quite some time.    I\'m sure there are other\'s out there with
better ones.  (Rob Dean does all his calculations by hand though...)
(and yes, he does take top honors for TL8 :-)

Also Richard, Uhh... I\'m afraid, I fall into the Laser Weapons-1 range.
Take an Argon Ion (or Krypton Ion) Laser, and I can clean it, run it,
change filters, change wavelengths, get a good beam out of it,
But as for designing a laser carbine?  No way!
	I\'m just a laser jock, I can ride \'em, I know what they do, but don\'t
ask me how they work man! :-)  (God!!  I sound like a Vilani:-(  )

thinking about tech level loss as a result of the rebellion. (I just
purchased Hard Times but haven\'t had a chance to look at it so maybe
some of this is addressed in there.)

My question is this: How does a planet maintain the loss of its tech
level? If a planet went from TL 12 to TL 9 it wouldn\'t take long to
get back to 12. It may take awhile to spread over the entire planet
but it would occur. And it would occur much more quickly than the 
first time since the knowledge is still there. 

Is the loss of tech levels associated with industrial centers? This
would make sense since if the industrial base is destroyed then it
becomes difficult to maintain current TL items. And these would be
prime targets in any battle. 

However, even if only the tiny centers survived the government would
step in and take control inorder keep existing TL items operational.
However, if all means of idustry were destroyed then the majority of 
the population would be destroyed as well and the fall in tech level
would be even greater.

Or is the loss associated with mass biological weapons killing people?
Which, to me, would result in a greater loss of TL\'s also.

The other point is: Why are planets being attacked to begin with? If
one faction attacks a planet because it sides with another is the 
attack punishment or retribution? If it\'s punishment the I can see
a few centers destroyed but if it\'s restribution I could understand
a more complete destruction. How ingrained is the "Save the real
estate." syndome? As in: Why aren\'t weapons of mass destruction used?

With all of the traffic generated on the TML about planet defenses
even light attacks seem too difficult to accomplish, especially with
high tech worlds. 

It was also brought up in an earlier posting, I forget who, but they
mentioned that trade, unbeknownst to us, is really more important than
the rules originally stated. The collapse of some economies resulted
from a loss trade.

Two things could result from this. The planet is too much of a hot spot
that no trader would be willing to go there, in which case the planet
has to develop on its own. Or the area has quietd down enough that it
would develop into a prime trade route. Any planet that lost TL\'s would
want to get them back and as quickly as it could. If it was a prime
trade center before it would definitely be one now.

	Same skills with me, though I probaly would have something like a
Knowledge(firearms/20th century)-2 or 3... 
	These skill levels seem okay. I generally have considered 
level-5 the \'master\' skill level; For example, Han Solo had a piloting of
at least 5, and Scotty had an engineering of at least 5. Two character\'s
in my campaigns have managed this level (both scouts), one in piloting
and the other in electronics.

	Never read the book, and might not have the chance to for awhile
(being an English major will do that...). I do agree with this, though.
The armor is just as important to the marine as his weapon; he (or she)
will know it inside and out as well as can be expected for the amount
of training (ie, skill level) given. Somehow, visons of _Full_Metal_Jacket_
and the marine who lost it spring to mind here...

>	So, looking at the above, one might have to have a skill level of

	Then again, with it being a armoed, sealed suit, you might not know what
was in it until you blow it apart...

would be internal (except, of course, for gross body volume and basic

don\'t think it\'s much of a stretch to postulate internal systems which scan
the operator\'s body and use some sort of "memory material" to modify the
padding to fit the current operator. Now, if you had, for instance, 
Michael J. Fox trying to wear Battle Dress designed for Hulk Hogan, he
might have a little trouble because there\'s simply not enough padding
to give him a snug fit. And, of course, the Hulkster simply wouldn\'t 
fit in Fox\'s suit. As for telling if an operator is male or female
from the outside, there\'s a big difference between the way a woman
walks and the way a man walks. Someone _could_ try to change their
style of walking, but I don\'t imagine they\'d want to for normal
operations. I\'d use the following task in any situation where someone
wants to know if a muffled figure is male or female:

     To identify the gender of a muffled figure:
     Difficult, Int, Disguise (Uncertain, Unskilled OK)
     Referee: On a result of Total Truth, the observer is
     certain the character is the correct gender. On a result
     of some truth, the observer is reasonably sure of the gen-
     der of the figure. On a result of No Truth, the observer
     is uncertain. On a mishap, the observer is certain the
     figure is the wrong gender. Increase the difficulty by
     one for reasonably similar and/or familiar races, and by
     two for unfamiliar, exotic races.

I think we\'ll have to agree to disagree on this point. I just happen
to consider a skill system that makes the second step (skill-0 =
first step, skill-1 = second step) equivalent to full army training
too coarse for my taste (Why, I even impose a negative DM on promotions
for military personel that hasn\'t reached skill-2 in any MOS). Still,
I can\'t resist the temptation to point out that medic-1 is listed
somewhere a equivalent to a nurse, medic-2 to a para-medic and not
until you reach doctor do you get to medic-3. Going by that I\'d say
that Ground Car-3 should be professional driving, granted, but taxi
driver/trucker; a professional racer would need 4-5 in skill.

And I still think Traveller could use a few more differentiations
in it\'s skill system. You may let Wet Navy captains navigate your
starships, but I require a real astrogator for mine ;-)

  The answer according to Hard Times is apparently that the Imperium was
just a big version of the Soviet Union where one planet made TL15 left shoes,
coathangers, and eggspoons and nothing else.
 
  Then Hard Times strike and all that they have left when the trade stopped
coming is a huge surplus of left shoes, coathangers, and eggspoons bursting 
out of the warehouses to drown everyone and inflict irreparable ecologic
damage as all the polished eggspoons reflect sunlight, increasing the albedo
of the planet and making its temperature drop.

  No, I\'m not drunk, there is an almost as silly example in Hard Times on
page 49.

  If we are talking about MegaTraveller, there were an article in Challenge #40
by Greg Porter, but some parts of his manuscript had been cut by the editors.
A full(er?) version can be found among the conversion essays at the end of 3G^3
(3G third edition).

  Note that his conversion was made to yield results similar to MegaTraveller
weapons already given in Players and Encyclopedia, a conversion method which
I don\'t agree with philosophically.

  I support the method of converting through the common physical bases if 
such a critter exists: A weapon that can penetrate 40mm of armor quality 
steel in 3G should be able to penetrate 40mm of hard steel in MegaTraveller
regardless of how far out the weapons given in the manuals are.
  
  This leads to a slightly (to use an understatement) different conversion
of DV to Pen. I posted it and a series of remade designs (cut off halfway,
unfortunately) to the TML about half a year ago. I don\'t know which bundle
they ended up in.

because of "Hard Times" (HT), but Michael Surman beat me to
the punch.  I\'d like to add a few more things, though.

A planet is, with some exceptions, a self-sustaining ecosystem.
It gets energy from its sun, and resources from itself.  The people
(sophonts, if you will) provide creative input upon these raw
materials and produce.  If a planet is capable of sustaining life,
then surely creative life will sustain itself there.

If the citizens have traditionally relied on outside demand and
assistance for technology, then being stranded will, in a VERY
short time, give rise to some wholly new, creative, innovative
technology that will quickly surpass the original.  (Look at 
Earth\'s history for examples.)  It might seem bad for a few years,
but in just a few short years, Hard times bring forth a new,
stronger, more vital culture.  

Out of these cultures will come the new empire.  It will panic
the established empire, they will come to blows, and the new culture
will dominate.  (examples, Babylonia, Greece, Rome, U.S. etc.)
Maybe the extant empire is destroying planets with promise?

As you might guess, the first thing I looked at was the new craft & the
construction stuff.

Question:  What use is a TL 4 resistojet when you
can\'t build a spacecraft power plant (batteries) till TL 5?

Did anyone even LOOK at the \'Little Renegade\' TL 8 spaceplane before they
published it?  Take a good look!  Ok, Disp=20, that\'s a the size of a 4.5
ton aircraft with the wings unfolded.  Or the size of a 13.5 ton aircraft
with them folded.  Ok, this thing is about the size of an A-4 Skyhawk, or
a MiG-21.  Right?

Look at the weight.  Loaded=484 tons.  Ok, this thing weighs more than
twice the weight of FULLY LOADED B-52, and has wings the size of a Skyhawk!??
Ok, think about it this way.  The Space Shuttle, fully loaded weighs
about 80 tons.  This thing weighs 6 times that and could fit in the shuttle
bay!

This thing is supposed to FLY?  For one thing it is going to have the glide
angle of a crowbar, and a stall speed in the super sonic range.  To land this
beast you\'d have to be flying at an absolutely horrendous rate of knots!
The Space Shuttle (the real one) requires a HUGE runway.  Why do you think
they land in the salt flats.  This design is going to require a runway of
much larger proportions.  It\'s a flying prostitute!  No visible means of
support!

Ok, in the adventure, they want you to land this thing on a planet that has
NO starport.  Not even a spaceport?  FORGET IT!  You would be dead. Dead. DEAD.

(It looks suspiciously like a design Rob Dean put up a LONG time ago, and it
was the ONLY design he\'s come up with where I said it will NOT work.)

Rob, was this one of your designs?

One other thing I noticed in here was the TL 6 vac suits.
They say they are related to TL 6 flight suits.  Presumably they are thinking
of the Mercury Project space suits.  Well, I once had the chance to buy an
old Mercury Project suit, (one of the ones used in training acutally) and did
a little research on that particular suit.  The Navy GS-1 (I think it was)
was NOT a good suit for dextrous operation.  (To put it mildly)  Oh, it was
just fine to walk around in and use when you\'re at atmospheric pressure, but
when pressurized, it becomes almost totally rigid.  Wearing one in vacuuum
would basically paralyze the wearer completely.  The problem is you are
wearing a huge man shaped rubber balloon.  There was no way to articulate the
joints against the pressure of the suit.

At 3PSI internal pressure, the amount of force required for the wearer to
touch his shoulder was the equivalent of bending a steel bar!
Dexterity -2 my eye!  All tasks while wearing the suit would be basically
impossible.  If the Mercury capsule had lost pressure, the capsule would have
had to be brought down by ground control COMPLETELY.  It would have basically
been impossible for the pilot to do ANYTHING.

Presumably the TL 5, and lower suits would have similar difficulties.

Subject: Reply to WILDSTAR\'s economic stats post     

The table below shows the major categories of Imperial expenditures, and the
amounts spent on them.  Note that the Imperial family recieves its income
in the form of dividends paid to the Throne (the Imperial family holds
shares in a number of megacorporations, and many lesser companies).  The
Imperial bureaucracy is supported by user fees (application, liscencing,
processing, and other fees paid for official services rendered).  Some
of these services actually produce a profit; others are subsidized by
the Imperium (for example, the XBoat network operates at a loss, but it is
subsidized through the IISS budget).  Much of these funds fall into the
"Other Expenditures" category.  The "Naval Estimates" and "Army Estimates" 
are, for historical reasons, the terms for the Navy and Army budgets.

Category           Percent   Budget (MCr)
- - ----
Naval Estimates      51.20  1,123,711,789
Army Estimates       16.05    352,257,309
Scout Service        21.31    467,701,137
Other Expenditures   11.44    251,079,352
- - ---- 
ALL                 100.00  2,194,749,587

- ----Minor quibble.  Doesn\'t the Imperium subsidize most of the starports
- ----within its boundries? This and the fact that I seriously doubt any
- ----bureaucracy the size of the Imperiums is going to operate at profit
- ----on any but the most local of levels leads me to blelieve that the
- ----Scout and Other categories should be a little higher.  Also, I expect
- ----that the Marines are a sufficiently independent organization to require
- ----a separate "Estimate".


These figures can be used to estimate the approximate volume of shipping
within the Imperium.  A 10,000 displacement ton hull will be used as an
"average" to estimate construction times.  A hull occupies its tonnage
in the shipyard for its entire construction time of 160 weeks.  Ships
must also undergo annual maintainance; 2 weeks every year.  The yards of
the Imperium have an annual capacity of 265,130,980,000 ton-weeks of new 
construction or maintainance, and an additional 227,086,570,000 ton-weeks 
of maintainance only.  Presumably, the Naval Bases, Naval Depots, Scout 
Bases, and Scout Waystations contain additional ship construction and repair 
facilities to build and maintain ships for the Imperial military services 
(this is a logical extension of the policy that a world\'s survey data does 
not include the personnel or technology of any military bases present).

- ----Unfortunately your assumption about Naval Bases, Depots, etc., is

- ----vessels the same way we do today; by letting contracts to civilian
- ----firms.
In peacetime, shipyards and ships presumably exist in an equilibrum: the
number of new ships constructed is the same as the number retired from
service; and all ships in service can recieve their annual maintainance.
In practice, there is always some spare shipyard capacity to provide for
regional differences, trade expansion, and so on.  Let us assume this
spare capacity at 10%.  The active lifetime of a ship must be at least as
long, and probably longer than, the period over which it is financed, 40 
years.  There is good reason (analysis of the Azhanti High Lightning
class cruisers, the only class of ships for which complete records are
available) to believe that the active life can be more than 100 years.
Let us assume that it is 80 years (exactly twice the pay-off time).

- ----No problem. If anything, your estimate might be low. However, I will have

Doesn\'t a Disp of 20 mean 20 cubic meters? (My books are buried)
If so, this puppy has a density of 484e6 grams/20e6 cc. Which works out
to 24.2 g/cc. This is *noticeacbly* denser than platinum, and in fact
denser than *any* know substance. (excluding things like "degenerate
materr, and neutronium).

So, it fails a class *Zero* reality check.

Well, in the 50\'s there was work on a *much* more flexible suit. It even
had a few tests in a vacuum chamber (with a person wearing it) before it
was cancelled. It was the basis for the "skinsuit" seenm in many SF
stories. We *could* have built it, we chose not too.

  This is obviously true when we are talking about Low Tech planets who has yet
to organize relatively cheap intra-system spacetravel, but I doubt that
*any* HighTech planet with a substancial population can survive on its own
for more than a few years without drawing upon the (in the most cases 
extremely large) resources of their system.

Revised Skill Description (weapons):

level-1: as above, but you can do basic maintainance on the weapon (typical

level-2: you are good enough to compete in contests, and can field strip your

level-3: you are very good with your weapon; you have a skill that is expected

level-4: you are an expert in your weapon; you can do major repairs, and
	if having mechanical and/or electronic skill (depending on the
	weapon type), you can do some customizing of the weapon on your
	own
level-5+: you are a master in the weapon; you can do major repairs and can
	design weapons in the class similar to your own, and can do major
	customizing if you have other skills appropriate to the job at hand.

I\'ve been toying with a design for a ship using an experimental
TL17 antimatter power plant, and I was wondering about just how
such a ship would go about getting refueled. Essentially, I would
just like to get people\'s opinions on how easy it would be to either
make or obtain the "fuel pods" necessary for such a power plant.

On a related note, does anyone consider the TL17-21 jump drives to
be using antimatter fuel? Their fuel requirements do not drop as
drastically as those for the power plants ( at least at TL17).

Thanks!

Well, they must have better taxi drivers in Copenhagen than around here! :-)

But I do agree about Wet Navy navigation vs. Astronavigation.  Fortunately
I never have had to deal with the problem of a Wet Navy navigator character.
Usually the Wet Navy characters are NPCs.

You may be right about rifle-1 though.  I have kinda based my idea of Rifle-1
and initial military training on the movie \'Full Metal Jacket\' (as I have no
experience of military training.)  But, one thing I would point out is that
US Marine forces are considered Elite Forces.  In a wargames I have seen, US
military forces (and NATO in general) get bonuses for superior training.
Perhaps then US Marines would get Rifle-2 as their initial training skill.

Perhaps this should be extended to the IMP Marines as they seem to be based on
the US Marines.

Hey!  Mark Cook!  If I remember right, you were a Marine.  Would you give us
your opinion on this?

I Had a similar problem creating fuel cell stats for a powered armor 
design system. I needed fuel cells much small than those listed in the 
rules.  I solve it by putting the existing stats into a linear regression 
utility and then deriving an equation for the values.

Yes, several.  Try sunbane first.  Here\'s its anonymous ftp stats:

	Name: sunbane.engrg.uwo.ca
	Addr: 129.100.100.12
	Dir:  pub/traveller
	Mgr:  dan@engrg.uwo.ca (Dan Corrin)

Sunbane contains the TML archive traffic, sector data, vheicle designs, etc.

You climb into your battle dress suit (combat armor etc).  Nudge the power

Ok, so you still probably couldn\'t have radically different size persons
wear the same suit, (Arnold Shwartzeneger vs. Danny Divito), but people of
ROUGHLY the same size and weight could probably manage.

values for said rocket, and I have worked them out.  For the standard
Fusion Rocket, fuel = ~3.3 kl/hour of LH2, or ~0.75 kl/hour of water

of the hydrogen being converted to energy, and the fusion products are used
as reaction mass.

        I\'ve not had a chance to even SEE Hard Times as of yet.  With
the way things have been I haven\'t had time to even get to a game shop
since I subscribed to the mail list about a month ago.  This, however,

Actually 1 displacement = 13.5 cubic meters, giving it a density of 24.2/13.5=
1.8 g/cc, which is better.  I might take this opportunity to point out that
fissionable fuel, according to the Referee\'s Manual, has a density of 25 g/cc,
which _is_ a problem as you note above.  Collapsium shielding on the fuel
rods, anyone?

Scott\'s original point, that a spaceplane designed using the the One Small Step
rules and meeting the minimum hull armor 40 requirement is going to be too
heavy to fly is quite true.

Scott wasn\'t a regular on the TML when the discussion over this point was going
on last year.  It was agreed by all the space science types on the list that
armor 40 was a good approximation of the real hull thickness that would be
required for long term radiation protection for a spacecraft crew (something to
do with cosmic ray cascades, as I recall.)  I suggest that anyone seriously
concerned about the matter adopt one of the following solutions:

Design the spaceplane strictly using COACC.
Design the spaceplane using COACC with an additional cost factor for a
     re-entry capable hull.  (Something like *5...)
Design the spaceplane using the Ref\'s Manual/One Small Step system, but allow
     an armor minimum of something smaller, like 8.

Since the craft is designed for landing and takeoff, not for deepspace ops, the
lower radiation resistance should be acceptable.  There are no rules for this,
apart from something in one of the later Traveller\'s Digests--it\'s just one of 
those little bits of reality based explanation that you can toss at the players
if they ask questions, which they probably won\'t.

Somewhere in the archives, you can find Scott\'s Orion spaceplane (an example of
the first scheme) and my TL8 10 ton ship\'s boat (an example of the third).

In the event that combat occurred involving a craft with an armor value of less
than 40, I\'d just use a +1 per 3 armor levels short damage modifier on the
combat tables.  So, a ship with an armor value of 10 (30 below 40) would be
subject to a DM of +10 on the damage tables.  Critical hits, interior 
penetrations and the like would be almost guaranteed.

It hasn\'t happened yet.  In fact, it hasn\'t even been scheduled yet.  For all
practical purposes, discussion of the revision over there is quite dead at
the moment.  I\'ll try to ensure that arrangements are made to get a transcript
over here when (if) it happens.

    'body' => 'I notice that Dow Reider is bitching about the "fusion rocket" in MT. 
Admittedly, he has excellent reasons to bitch.  However, I notice that
noone has bothered to say anything rude about the OTHER rocket types
presented in Hard Times and COACC.
Herein are my own complaints:

    1)  Basic and advanced rocket - specific impulse 16000+ each.  The SSME
has a specific impulse of 459 (last I heard).

    2)  The Nuclear thermal rocket (NERVA, I presume?) - specific impulse
is 550,000+.   The NERVA we built a few decades ago was tested on the
ground at a specific impulse of 780-odd.  It was expected to reach 800+ in
actual operation.  The most wildly optimistic extrapolations of the NERVA
produced specific impulse in the range of 10,000 at most, if certain
insurmountable problems could be overcome by future materials technology.

    3)  he "resistojet" - specific impulse 1.8 (salute!).  Admittedly, this
is a steam rocket out of a boiler, but REAL steam engines produce steam
with specific impulse much higher than that, by a factor of 10 to 100,
depending on steam pressure.

    4)  Likewise the mass driver rocket.  specific impulse 100.  Real  ones
were cobbled together in labs with ten times the specific impulse.  There
was not found to be any real difficulty making them ten times better still.

    5)  The ion rocket - It is hard to argue with a system so open-ended as
an ion rocket, but I will anyway.  specific impulse 1,200,000.  Most
real-world design work has produced ion drives with specific impulse less
than 50,000.  There is no good reason that an ion drive could not have ANY
specific impulse less than light speed.  It\'s just inefficient to do so. 
MY big quibble is the power required.  Their ion drive SHOULD use at least
2.88+ Gw per unit.  It uses 500 Kw per unit.  MIRACULOUS PERFORMANCE!  The
mind boggles...

    6)  The solid rocket - specific impulse 3000.  Real world examples
seldom reach 300.

    7)  The others - mostly have been bitched at by other experts.  My 2
cents worth would be wasted.

    8)  The LALV (Lift-Assisted Launch Vehicle).  What a concept!  A NASP
(National Aero-Space Plane) that uses more fuel than an equivelant-sized
rocket.  The LALV uses FAR more fuel than a straght rocket, and requires
more engine weight and less payload.  SO WHAT\'S THE POINT???  Why build a
device that doesn\'t work as well as the nearest alternative?

    And 9)  The notion (used in Hard Times_[}, and on Rob Dean\'s recent TL8
rocket posted here) that any sane man would put battleship armor plate on a
rocket of any kind.  factor 40 armor is equivelant to over 13" of steel
(33.6 cm to all of us who use SI as a way of life).  Putting that kind of
armor on a rocket is less reasonable than doing it on your automobile.  A
more realistic figure would be armor 8 (or perhaps 4).  Then the
performance of your machine would be higher, and the cost would be lower.

of the technological collapse of the Imperium.  Herein is a dissenting
point of view.

The basic assumption about Hard Times TL loss is that the worlds are trying
to become self-sufficient by dropping back 5 TLs and punting.

Why should this be so?  Admittedly, these worlds could not build all of the
High-Tech wonders required before Hard Times.  So why does it then follow
that they would spend lots of money building industries to produce archaic
equipment?  If you need to spendd the money on new industries anyway, why
not build industries producing modern stuff?
I mean, we\'re TL8, right?  If we suffered a major economic loss (up to but
excluding a high level nuclear exchange), it would be EXTREMELY unlikely
that we would stop building automobiles and start building horse-carts. 
The need would not be there unless 99+% of our auto industry were blasted
into the stratosphere.  Even then, it would be EASIER to reconstruct to
build something we are familiar with, rather than something we\'ve never
done before.
In Hard Times, it is possible for a TL15 world to lose grav technology. 
Grav is a 10,000 year old technology.  It would be like us losing the
ability to build a WHEEL!  It is also unreasonable to suppose that, after
losing grav, the world would build a factory to produce items that noone
has seen for 10,000 years (wheeled vehicles, that is).  As long as you
gotta build a factory, build a TL15 grav vehicle plant.  It\'s going to cost
gobs of money either way, but this way you get something GOOD for the
money.

Acutually, Leonard, you forgot a factor of 13.5 in there.  The Disp=20
referrs to displacement tons which are 13.5 Kl (don\'t ask me why, liquid
Hydrogen is approx 14Kl per ton)  Thus the volume of the beast is 270
cubic meters.  The average density of this monster is 1.79 Kg per liter.

Just a Hair less than twice the density of water.

As Richard Johnson said:  \'With a stall speed around Mach 2, only orphans
may apply for crew positions!\'

Seriously though, I think I put out a TL 7 or 8 space plane that could be
housed in a 20 Disp ton hanger.  It was quite a while ago, before I officially
joined the TML.  (I have no earthly idea where it could be found, I assume
it is in the FTP vehicle site, where ever that is.)  I would STRONGLY suggest
that you all use that as a substitute vehicle should you run that adventure.
Sure there\'s a lot less cargo carried, but it should do the job the one in
Hard Times is supposed to do.  (I think it was called the Orion)

Leonard also mentioned the \'Skin suit\' Huh?  Wassat?  Please elaborate.

By looking at the figures on the suit in there and the description of it, I
assumed they were talking about suits like the ones in Project Mercury.
(that is the TL 6 ones that are a LOT lighter than the TL 7 ones)

I would assume that the TL 7 ones they list are similar to Gemini or Apollo
suits.

The point is that if you put a man in a classic diving suit.  (rubber sealed
cloth and hard helmet)  He would not be able to move at all.  So watch out
for those used vac suit salesmen with bow ties selling slightly used TL 4,5,6
vac suits!  (It was owned by a little old lady from Regina...)

The Ghauri class of Assault tenders form the backbone of Imperial battle rider squadrons. A squadron
consists of three tenders each capable of carrying upto 3 Aibak class riders. The black globe generator can
serve both offensively and defensively. However its primary role is defensive where the enemy manages
to penetrate the rider screen and attack the tender with capital ships. The black globe allows the tender
some measure of defense until support arrives or it can disengage by jumping. Against craft without spinal
weapons the ship\'s 40 LSP Class X missile bays can launch devastating volleys of nuclear and/or standard
missiles. That combined with its relative agility makes it a hard opponent to catch and destroy. 

The most prominent squadron of the Ghauri class is the 871st Battle Rider squadron, "The Eyes of Death".
The squadron consists of 3 Ghauri class tenders Taimur, Mahmud & Nadir. They carry 9 Aibak-B class
riders. The squadron was used extensively in raids against the Zhodani forces during 5FW. The squadron
chalked up an incredible record of destroying over 15 million displacement tons worth of Zhodani shipping
including combat vessels without losing a single rider.

The Aibak class of riders form the backbone of the Imperial Rider squadrons. Inspite of their relatively small
size they pack an enormous punch with their spinal - N meson gun. Contrary to what might be expected
they are well protected and highly agile craft. Standard deployments are on board Ghauri class Attack
Tenders which carry 3 Aibaks. However all Imperial Tenders have the capability of carrying these craft and 
several planetary governments construct them as core ships for system defense squadrons.

The Aibak-B is a specialised battle rider equipped with Black Globe generators. These ships are built in
limited quantity and usually no more than one squadron (9-riders) is available per sector. This is primarily
due to Imperial Naval High Command reluctance to put Black Globe generators on such small craft. Their
role is highly specialised and is basically to penetrate heavy defenses to accomplish some mission or to
surprise enemy defenses. To this end the black globe is used at full on until the whole squadron has closed
wih the enemy. In fleet actions they are sometimes used to penetrate the enemy fleet and reach its "rear"
before the main force engages. Once engaged the low factor Black Globe is of limited use and is usually
turned off. Additionally the lack of jump drives means that the globe cannot be used to protect it while the
ships attempts to jump. When properly deployed the Aibak-B can be highly devastating to prepared enemy
defenses.

Subject: Economics in Hard Times


Steve Higgenbotham offers a dissenting view of the "Hard Times" scenario
presented by GDW.  The following is my rebuttal, with my assertions drawn
mostly from how we understand international economics to work... (or not work,
depending upon whom you ask).

>The basic assumption about Hard Times TL loss is that the worlds are trying
>to become self-sufficient by dropping back 5 TLs and punting.

>Why should this be so?

It is so, mainly because the vast majority of these planets never indigenously
developed the technological base to support their tech levels.  This does not
mean that *all* the planets in the Former Imperium will revert back to TL15,
nor do I believe that this is what "Hard Times" intended to imply.  There
would naturally be certain cores of development, mostly around the oldest and
most developed regions of the FI (Former Imperium).  In fact, this is exactly
what we see in "Hard Times", with the compact "safe zones" around the capitals
of the major players (Wariner, Capitol, Vland, etc.)

Nevertheless, the vast majority of the worlds have suffered either one of two
fates:  A) They have been in the way of two or more large battle fleets (just
take Zarushagar as a prime example); or B) They were backwater regions that
survived on what limited trade did come through (the Reaver\'s Deep area comes
to mind).  Some places, such as the Trojan Reaches and parts of the Solomani
Rim, are a victim of both.  Thus the "wilds" described in "Hard Times".  In
essence, the planets that are reduced to near TL5 were either bombarded or
starved back into the Stone Age (i.e. the 1950\'s).

>                                               So why does it then follow
>that they would spend lots of money building industries to produce archaic
>equipment?  If you need to spend the money on new industries anyway, why
>not build industries producing modern stuff?

Primarily, they don\'t have the technological know-how required, nor (even more
importantly) the capital to do the job.  They may have a lot of money, but if
they don\'t have the silicon-etching equipment to make a TL8 computer, then how
are they going to make a TL8 computer?  (Consider a country like Ethiopia
trying to start up its own semiconductor chip industry without foreign
capital!)  And just look at the Former Soviet Union.  Here was a former
Superpower that today, can\'t even feed itself.  With such examples so
prevalent in the contemporary world, it takes very little imagination to see
how the Imperium might unravel, given 5+ years of cataclysmic war.

>I mean, we\'re TL8, right?  If we suffered a major economic loss (up to but
>excluding a high level nuclear exchange), it would be EXTREMELY unlikely
>that we would stop building automobiles and start building horse-carts.
>The need would not be there unless 99+% of our auto industry were blasted
>into the stratosphere.  Even then, it would be EASIER to reconstruct to
>build something we are familiar with, rather than something we\'ve never
>done before.

On this point, I must disagree most strongly.  First of all, if there had been
any but the *MOST LIMITED* (i.e. one or two detonations) of nuclear exchanges,
the world would have been lucky to escape with 5% of its manufacturing
capacity intact.  Most probably, a nuclear war would completely demolish all
industrial capacity for at least two years.  (The minimum time required for
the surviving population to reach some sort of morbidity equilibrium *and*
begin feeding itself on a reliable basis).  I believe that a liberal estimate
of this new population level would be on the order of tens of millions of
people WORLDWIDE.  Not nearly enough to sustain industry of any size.  THIS is
exactly what the worlds inside the former battlezones of the FI have to deal
with.

Regarding the point that it would be easier for us to construct an automobile
than a horse cart, it may be true.  But, there would be no capacity to
construct automobiles in a post-nuclear holocaust Earth.  We would be lucky to
have horse-drawn wagons, or even horses!

>In Hard Times, it is possible for a TL15 world to lose grav technology.
>Grav is a 10,000 year old technology.  It would be like us losing the
>ability to build a WHEEL!

Not quite.  The wheel is the single simplest machine known to humankind.  Grav
technology requires a well-developed technological/industrial base.  About the
only worlds with that kind of home-grown capacity are exactly the ones inside
the "safe zones".

>                               It is also unreasonable to suppose that, after
>losing grav, the world would build a factory to produce items that noone
>has seen for 10,000 years (wheeled vehicles, that is).  As long as you
>gotta build a factory, build a TL15 grav vehicle plant.  It\'s going to cost
>gobs of money either way, but this way you get something GOOD for the
>money.

War is hell.

Finally, regarding Steve\'s point about high TL machinery suddenly
disappearing, I would have to agree with him.  The whole idea is ludicrous.
I\'m sure there would be mountains of very high-tech novelties just lying
around.  Some of them might even work.  But just try to maintain them, or get
them repaired!  Does anyone know where there\'s a technician with Laser
Weapons-5 and Electronics-4?  Big $$$$$$$$.

Sorry this got so long.  I guess I just got up on a soapbox again.  Oh well,
at least we don\'t have to be insulted with an Imperium-wide computer virus
anymore.

Anyway, to answer Scott\'s question, a vacc suit has to supply two things.
First, it has to have a gas-tight membrane of some sort, so as to prevent
loss of oxygen. Second, it has to support the internal pressure required
(at least 3 psi for pure oxygen, 15 psi for oxy/nitro)

It turns out that *skin* will work just fine as the gas barrier. So a
skinsuit is basicly an elastic leotard that supplies the pressure required
to keep your body from doing nasty things to itself. You do have to add
some padding and the like in a few areas to round things out, plus you
need an arrangement over the chest to allow for breathing (sort of a
balloon to keep the volume unchanging). Just add a neck seal and helmet,
and you have a suit. 

This actually has advantages over regular suits, as you get to use your
body\'s built-in cooling system instead of one of those bulky packs. Sweat
carries away a *lot* of heat when it is evaporating in a vacuum! 

Such suits were built and tested in the mid-50s (I beleive it was done at
Wright-Patterson AFB). They had their own problems, such as being *very*
hard to put on or take off, and needing to be *very* formfitting. They
also needed an elastic that didn\'t degrade upon long exposure to vacuum.
But they were actually *worn* in a vacuum chamber during testing. 


Now for Pooh Bear\'s comment about impulse...
Rocket efficiency is measured in terms of "specific impulse" (in this
case, specific has the same meaning as in "specific gravity", that is,
"per unit of mass"). 

In other words, "specific impulse" meaans "how big an impulse (momentum
change) can a unit mass of fuel cause".

The "formula" is ancient (and ignores unit balance):
Isp = (pounds of thrust) / (pounds per second of fuel consumption) 
This give Isp in seconds. Another means of calculating it is to divide the
exhaust velocity by g (32.17 ft per second^2 or 9.8 m/sec^2).

As I said, there\'s a fundamental flaw in the way the units are expressed,
but it *does* work. With an Isp of 450, the Space Shutttle engines could
produce 450 tons of thrust with a fuel flow rate of 1 ton per second of
fuel. (450 = 450/1) From this point, calculations are easy.

I usually go by an *old* chart that NASA distributed to partically every
science classroom in the country. It listed the Isp for the following
types of rocket:
chemical	400 (theoretical max at the time)
"nuclear heating" 
(ie NERVA)	800
fusion		600,000
ion		??? (can\'t recall)
photon		31 million

Note that from the real world we have things like the better model rocket
solid fuel engines doing about 180 (Centuri Enerjet engines in the mid
70s) and the Space Shuttle main engines doing 450 or so (and I hear that
it\'s unlikely that they can be improved on as far as Isp goes...
maintenance, and cost are a different matter)

  Imagine an SF-writer in the middle ages. Larry Niven model 1400. This 
enterprising writer has a question: How would the society look if the 
communications capability were to increase hundredfold. He makes the not
totally unresonable assumption that people in the future will be able to
store documents several illuminated folio pages long on little pieces of
rock, he calls them \'stone chips\'.
  Now this is almost exactly how it is going to be. I envy the person that
can get it this right. But what will his next step (based on the time he lives
in, the technology they have there and so on) be? 
  In all times, people has tried to squeeze in a lot of text on thin paper to
get it to fit on the leg of a homing pigeon. So what the writer writes about 
is how these \'stone chips\' are put on the legs of homing pigeons and how this
gian leap in communications technology affects the society.

  The error here is that between pigeon and chips, a lot of other technologies
will emerge, some of which are more suitable for communications than 
the writers\' air-mobile EPROMs. Are we doing the same kind of error when
we try to predict the future: Certainly, but we don\'t know in what areas.

  Take the nanotech battle-dress for example: In my not so humble opinion,
a nanotech battle-dress is comparable with a silicon-lubricated electrically
operated aluminium ballista shooting tungsten quarrels. The changes brought on
by nano-tech so advanced that one can make a battledress out of it is 
probably so big that the need of battle-dress will disappear. Why walk to the
enemy and blow his brains out when you can send out a grey-goo nanobot and 
make mush out of him with a kill-probability of 99.9%?

  On the other hand there is also the opposite problem: Inflated belief that
new inventions will make current tactics etc. obsolete: Witness the missile-
mania of the 60\'s where every tank, aircraft, ship or sub could be replaced
by the appropriate missile that would do their job much cheeper and without
any drawbacks. Well, it didn\'t happen that way: We still have tanks and 
aircrafts and so on.

  But I still don\'t believe a nano-tech battledress will be needed:)

Specific impulse is a measure of rocket/jet performance.  It is defined
as the number of seconds a unit of fuel can support it\'s own weight in
one G.  If you multiply specific impulse by 9.8m/s^2 (or 32.2ft/s^2),
the result is exhaust velocity of the propellant in m/s (or ft/s).
 
This value can then be inserted into:
 
     deltaV = (exhaust velocity)*ln[(initial mass)/(initial mass - fuel 
mass)]
 
to get the rocket\'s total deltaV

So what happened to those IDPs (Imperial Data Packages)???  WHile it is
true that you have to have the tools to build the tools, the IDPs
provide convenient blueprints for all that good stuff.  Did they all
evaporate too?
The Soviet Union was never a superpower, they were a third world country
with nuclear weapons.  Notice also that it took 70 YEARS for the Soviet
Union to reach that point.  Hard Times assumes the Imperium will reach
it in 5 years or less.

Actually, if you look closely at Hard Times, the effects of prolonged
nuclear bombardment are covered in a different section.  The TL loss IS
affected by level of destruction, but will take place to a lesser extent
if there is no bombardment at all.
The population loss due to the war is also dealt with, and is seldom
that extreme, anyway.
The notion (to change the subject back down to Earth for a second) that
a general nuclear exchange between the USA and the Soviet Union would
destroy the industry in South America, Africa, Australia, Asia, etc. 
has always puzzled me.  Could you explain why detonating bombs in North
America should destroy factories in South America???
In any case, with bombardment that extensive, the world (MT one again)
will not drop back 5 TLs, but will drop back 15 and start all over.  Not
the situation described in Hard Times either.

So, how simple is Grav technlogy?  I didn\'t know that we had developed
it yet.  I assumed that any discussion of the technical difficulty of
Grav would have to wait until we got it and found out how hard it was.
 
Notice that the process for making reliably good steel took 2000+ years
to perfect, BUT was an EXTREMELY SIMPLE process, once you know how.
Notice that Fusion plants are so difficult that we haven\'t quite got one
working yet, but the construction of a Tokamak (for instance) is simpler
than an automobile engine.  Just bigger.

My microwave has lasted for seven years without maintenance.  My car
seven years without any spare parts other than oil filters and brake
shoes, and without maintenance that I couldn\'t do with the tools in the
my trunk.  The only time this computer has been in the shop has been to
add more memory and a better modem.  My father\'s Air-Conditioner has
been chugging away for 14 years now with no maintenance except a new
filter every year or so.
Cynthia points out that her mother\'s microwave lasted 14 years without
maintenance.  It was also one of those microwaves that still used
pre-solid state components.
The US Navy\'s SSBNs have been operating for ~30 years.  There hasn\'t
even been a factory making most of their major spares since 1972.  They
swap equipment around from each other, and refurbish it in Navy shops. 
They\'ve been doing that for 20 years now, and the boats still spend 250+
days per year at sea.  Or so it was when I was on a boomer 5 years ago.
 
So why should TL15 equipment be MORE prone to failure than modern
equipment.  After all, they should have fewer moving parts, better
materials, beter manufacturing processes, better everything.  So why
should they break down so fast?  After all, a world like Terra (1128)
probably has 10,000,000,000 small fusion plants (in grav vehicles), as
well as the grav generators in those vehicles.  I\'m pretty sure we could
keep 1,000,000,000 or so of those running with spare parts from the
others.  Probably for 100 years or more.
 
(up on my soapbox)
The primary requirements for high technology are knowledge (provided by
IDPs in the Imperium), and energy (lots and lots of it).  Rob Dean
pointed out that one Atlantis class battleship had ten times the
generation capacity of the USA.  Assuming that "shattered ships of the
fighting Imperium"  designs have any validity at all, virtually every
battleship in the Imperium produces 5+ times as much energy as the USA
does.  Assuming that free-traders aren\'t blasted out of space, the
free-trader\'s power plant produces more energy than the world did 75
years ago.  The energy will NOT be hard to come up with in the Imperium,
the knowledge is already there, the Hard Times will last for a few years
at most.
 
Notice that in 1919 Germany was in worse shape than most Imperial
planets : total economic collapse was beginning, their industry was all
in the hands of their enemies, and there was no external support to
speak of.  20 years later, they had a MORE advanced technology than any
of their neighbors (including the USA), and had built an industrial
complex that allowed them to fight the USA and USSR for four long years
till it was overcome.  And they din\'t even fully mobilize their industry
for wartime production until 1944!  If they can do that, why should a
world in the Imperium, with blueprints in hand, have a hard time
duplicating their recovery?

They must be pretty close with respect to their basic requirements though.
It might have been cheaper for a world to import luxury grav cars instead
of building them themselves, but imagine the trade fleet necessary to
supply a basic runaround floater for every family on Mora. And even if they
import them all, they certainly will do their own maintenance!

If the trade was limited then the reliance on it would be limited too.
You can\'t have it both ways. Planets in backwaters would be _less_
susceptible to the loss of trade than those in other areas.

Any society that can maintain an industrial tech level is pretty well
organized. It will have both the industrial support, ressources,
manpower and knowledge to climb the tech levels fast. Level 5
technology isn\'t very ressource friendly. If you can maintain
that, you can maintain a higher TL, if only you can achieve it.
And even if the know-how isn\'t there, the basic knowledge is there.
It\'s bootstrapping yourself up from a pre-industrial tech level
that would be a problem. Any society with TL 5 is more than
halfway to TL 10 :-)

Some other way. The history of our own planet shows that man (well, some
men :-) are infinitely inventive. And hard times (like wars) seems to
stimulate inventiveness enourmously. Remember, they may not have the
technological know-how, but they will have the theoretical knowledge.
Considering the ability Terran scientists have demonstrated for duplicating
inventions that they just knew existed, any society that already has a
basic textbook about the subject will be able to cope.

I\'ve read enough after-the-holocaust stories to accept the concept of an
Imperial fleet bombing a world back to the stone age (but not, as mentioned
above, back to TL 5 (except very temporarily). What I object to in
Hard Times is the assumption that worlds that does survive the war years
relatively intact will be unable to recover and that the new polities will
inevitably fail after a few years. In the two subsectors detailed in Hard
Times alone there are four planets that IMO would be capable of reestablishing
interstellar trade on a limited basis: Accra (C6877A4-B), Khavle (C334965-B),
Aight (C752A98-A) and Westfir (B326882-B). On the other hand I have my doubts
about the only planet with a surviving class A starport, Medora (A422530-B).
With a population of only 400.000 the amount of starships it can build and/or
maintain will be on the slender side. At the very least it will need to band
together with neighbouring planets. But any high-population world with a
tech level of 11 and above will be a polity (or the core of one) in itself.
"Ah, but..." I hear you say. "Westfir can only maintain starships, not build
them with it\'s class B starport, and the other three are even worse off with
their miserable class C starports." Ah yes! That brings me to my worst peeve
wrt Hard Times: That there is no provision for any of the numbers
_increasing_. Pre-Rebellion Westfir had a class B starport despite it\'s tech
level of 13 being more than enough to build jump-drives. Why? Obviously
because other nearby worlds could make starships cheaper than they could
themselves (which nearby worlds are a mystery. All the worlds in the two
subsectors with an A starport (pre-Rebellion) have populations of 5 or less;
it\'s a mistake to believe that semi-random numbers will make sense without
a bit of judicious tweaking. But I digress). In 1124 Westfir\'s starport is
still class B and presumably relatively intact (since it still is class B
;-), while most nearby class A starports are history. So what is Westfir\'s
obvious next move? Why, to convert some of it\'s extensive spaceship con-
struction and starship maintenance capacity to starship construction.
Bingo, one class A starport. The cases of Accra, Khavle and Aight are perhaps
a little less easy. Khavle\'s shipyards, for example, propably suffered in the
events that reduced it\'s starport from class B to C, but in 1128 it still has
a population of 7 billion. Surely they can manage to get a portion of their
shipyards operational, especially if trade really is so all-fired important
to them. Even 10% of their prewar capacity comes to a tidy bit. One obvious
jury-rig is an alliance with Medora wherein Medora switches to producing
jumpdrives exclusively and Khavle makes all the rest of the ships. A very
beneficial arrangement for both sides, I should think.

One danger, that Hard Times does _not_ address, is the possibility that all
these new polities will war with each other over trade planets. I believe
that there would be a lot more new polities in 1128 than Hard Times thinks;
I also believe that a number of them will have succumbed to neighbours
within a decade. But there will also be a lot that survives.

    On the subject of Hard Times, I managed to acquire a copy this
weekend in the local games shop/record emporium. It looks
interesting, as does the discussions in here recently.

The close analogue to an Imperial planet is a country, rather than
the whole planet. Take for example the \'planet\' Ireland: medium size,
breathable atmosphere, nice climate (if a bit damp). Population is
about 4 million, primary exports are animal and dairy products,
alcohol (Guinness ... yum), assembled computer peripherals and
software. There is also some trade in clothing, music and other
artforms. Locally-owned seaborne links to the rest of the world
(equivalent to starships) amount to a few small or medium sized
freighters. *Everything* else is imported. In fact, Ireland\'s
computer equipment exports are assemblies only -- no native
production of the parts. As I understand it, Hard Times is about the
collapse of large-scale interstellar trade: if that goes, Ireland is
on its knees. No parts for its transport, no spares for its computer
networks, phones, microwave ovens, dishwashers ... and in this case
there are no serious iron or reserves with which to build local
replacements. What I\'m trying to say is that many planets don\'t have
the industrial base to maintain themselves without interstellar trade.

In any case, I\'m sort of puzzled by these pirates. Why have they such
crummy ships (and also why don\'t the splinters of the Imperium go and
take them out)? I know the Imperial Navy is supposed to be down to
about 30% strength, but the other 70% can\'t all be radioactive
vapour. How come the pirates are running round in X-boat tenders and
mining ships? How about some remnants of the destroyer raiding
squadrons? Anyway, if the pirates have such poor equipment, why can\'t
the factions send out some patrols and deal with them. A Gazelle-
class or the escort in MTJ2 (Fiery-class? I can\'t remember) should be
able to take out a corsair easily enough (factor-5 lasers and heavy
armour -- critical hits on a corsair and none on the escort).

What do all these pirates live on? I can cope with the idea of
occasional pirates hiding out near some trade route and taking a
crack at rich-looking merchantmen, but what\'s the point of raiding
planets? Pirates have a need for fuel, spare parts, ordnance, food
etc and a market somewhere else for the stuff they steal. Raiding
planets will surely most likely get them a holdful of potatoes, not
luxuries or items in scarce supply which they can sell elsewhere in
the outland areas.

Overall, I see Hard Times as an attempt to have adventures in the
Long Night, which is fair enough. However I do have some reservations
about the effects the collapse will have. Also, it cuts down on the
options available to characters -- if they\'re in the outlans they\'re
either pirates, prey or starmercs.

I am forced to agree, more or less.
We (Cynthia and I) have not spent much time looking at the Warring
States period of the Recovery.  We both noticed that the Hard Times are
ideal periods for the "man on a horse" syndrome:  the Strong Leader
(read: Hitler, Stalin, Churchill, Roosevelt) will rescue us from all our
problems if we just do everything he says.  Some of these Leaders will
be benevolent.  Some won\'t.  There should be long term warfare in the
Former Imperium between the various polities and their various Leaders.
 
BUT...
 
We really should keep in mind those "Safe Areas".  They are already
larger, stronger, and more industrialized than any polity is likely to
be in the next few years.  Now that the shooting has stopped, they
should start re-expanding into the void within a few years at most. 
This MAY result in resumed general warfare between Lucan and the
Universe, but Lucan is the Leader LEAST capable of re-expanding:  He
tends to destroy worlds that annoy him, and that tends to cause people
to fight to the last breath to keep from being conquered by him (sort of
like the Russian partisans in WW2 - Stalin was a bastard, but Hitler was
worse, so let\'s keep Hitler out no matter what it takes).  Norris,
Vland, Margaret, possibly Dulinor should be pushing their borders back
well before 1130.  
Unfortunately, they are all going to run into the Solomani Confederation
pushing IT\'S borders back.  I suspect, in the long run, that the Former
Iperium will become the Rule of Man (again!) with government on Terra.

vehicles with interest.  Here are my suggestions:

      1)  Put factor 40 armor around the life-system only.  I doubt that
the fuel tanks and drives need radiation protection.

       2) If hulls with variable armor thickness bother you, build your
spacecraft as a 2-stage craft.  The first stage is  armored to level 40,
and contains engines and life-system.  The second stage contains fuel and
cargo, and is armored to level 8.

In either case, you produce a craft that is a whole lot more reasonable.

As to the LALV problem, I finally figured out why it is a problem.  Hard
Times made a slight change to COACC that resulted in the rocket being more
efficient than a jet.  The fuel + oxidizer weighs LESS than the fuel alone
in the jet.  An odd state of affairs, at best.
Without tampering with the rules too much, try this:  a scramjet (with
identical characteristics to a ramjet except fuel usage) burns H2 in
atmospheric oxygen at a rate 75% of that of a high performance rocket. 
Since the fuel has a very low density, this is equivalent to burning 1/6th
as much fuel as the rocket does.  Eliminate the LOOONG flight to orbit. 
The NASP mission profile calls for almost a straight boost into orbit from
15000m.  A LALV should be required to sustain flight for THREE times as
long as an equivalent rocket, plus any loiter time in atmosphere at the end
of flight.  And remember air-to-air refueling.  It helps a lot!  
This way, the LALV is actually an advantage over a rocket, and so worth
building.

ALternately, if using NERVA, steal an idea from Arthur Clarke.  Have the
NERVA use atmosphere for propellant till it reaches the stratosphere.  Then
the LALV will use NO FUEL AT ALL except that 1/10th required for orpbital
insertion.  Very efficient, quite cost effective as an alternat to Grav.

know is wether it\'s worth it to include the real-world delta-V formula

Recovering most rocket-type launch vehicles is impossible.  Not so with
a LALV.

Would the IDPs be coming through with the piracy and war that is
suppossed to be wreaking such havoc? Were these things being sent out for
free? (note:I haven\'t yet aquired Hard Times, so I may be speaking from
considerable ignorance)

The Soviets did have massive industial plants though- I don\'t think
it\'s fair to call them a third-world nation. They fielded not just
nukes, but a navy, submarines, tanks, etc, and had a burgeoning space program.
Admeittedly, they havn\'t forgetten any of that stuff yet. But maybe
all the smart-guys on the hi-tech worlds are moving off to where
thier skills can be supported more luceratively (core areas).

Grav technology may  be simple, but it\'s much more expesive than wheels.
(as the horse cart is than an auto). With the general finacial collapse that
would seem to be enatiled by the disruption of trade, and the general
malaise of war, and the fear about the future promoting depression
(as we see today with buyers being cautious) I might be happy
to give up my abaility to fly around the world in 20 minutes in my sleek
megacredit speeder and just buy a cheap lo-tech ground car.

Fusion plants raises another issue, which is that of the government
financing of hi-tech products. Industrail policy would avryu from world
to world, but probably be present in some form. But with budgets
becoming tight, the money that used to go into such hi-tech research
would go into more sustainable,  immediately practical technologies.

If the governement stops subsidizing the local fusion plant because it
can no longer afford to do so (or the knowhow has gone off-world) or
the spare parts arent being made, all your hi-tech gadgets will be useless.

The soviets are experinceing this now with their reactors (according to 
recent news reports). Their refurbishing old parts, but who knows
how long that will last.

BTW where are hi-tech, low water worlds getting their hydrogen?

But our navy isn\'t undergoing a major financial crunch, and facing
a major military threat at the moment. Hard times would be a feedback
loop: the markets go down, the technology skips a beat, causing more
finacial instability and so on.

I\'ve always understood tech to be an average for the population.
Reducing the number of hi-tech items by 90% means only the wealthy
or the government then could have them. I imagine the governement would
do that in such perilous times (witness rationing during WWII).

Plus there\'s going to be a lot fewer wealthy, since I doubtmany of them
were hoarding hard currency, but had alot of paper (or silicon) assets.

Was all this technology in the hands of the average german or in
the military. There were no commercial jetliners for long after the
germans developed the jet. This is an interesting thread, though:
as worlds going through this diffculty might turn to such command
economy alternatives (i.e. Nazi autarky) to speed up relief.


I wanted to address another issue though, and that is the vilani
cultural influence, which must be prevalent to some extent throughout
the imperium in general. If the smart-sophonts have hightailed it out of the
dangerous areas, it would leave alot of people behind who wouldn\'t know
were to begin to understand a tech 15 blueprint, and who might not
want to when they could just slap together an oxcart (or run
a driveshaft out of their failed grav-vehicle).

Maybe the 5-level techdrop is too extreme, maybe it isn\'t extreme enough.
It would seem to be a good way to quantify the general chaos of the
hard times period. Remeber that the rich on the necounter tables always did
have +2 TL items, and the peasants -2 TL. (or therebaouts.)
I\'m going to get hard times soo and give it a looksee. It sounds
interesting.

    'body' => 'Subject: Hard times

I don\'t have it (and am basically waiting for T3), so what I say may be
on the nose or a truckload of it.

I think the biggest hit of hard times is the loss of trade.  Take your
average world...

   B555555-7  (I can\'t think of the trade stuff offhand)

For the moment, assume that NO trade ever comes again.  The big crash.
End of game.  Now, the world has a decent atmosphere and water supply,
so it won\'t be doomed on those accounts (as would be, IMHO, the same
population in a B100555-7 situtation.  Even then, they barely have the
TL to maintain themselves, assuming they can make the components they need.)

Now look at the rest of it.  you have ~50000 people (the size of a large
US town) on a world with ~65% of the Earth\'s land surface.  If you assume
there is a decent cross-section of skills, they can probably maintain their
TL, or perhaps loose no more than 1.  If you assume they are all specialized
farmers and import technicians, they will probably drop to pre-industrial
levels.

"Hard-Timing" the imperium is obviously going to be a 3-step process for
each world.  "What if: all trade is cut off?"

   1) Does the population have to fight the environment in order to
      survive?

      If it does, then a certain TL is required to maintian it.  If you drop
      below this TL, the entire world goes belly up and you end up with
      a ghost world when contact is regained.

      If the world is generally habitable, the minimum TL will obviously be
      0 or 1.

   2) Resources? Does the world have the necessary material to maintain its
      TL?

      If not, then you will ses a decline in TL as material reserves are
      used up.  Imagine our world (TL8) if suddenly all our Oil went dry.
      Most likely we\'d hold on for a while, but a majority of our society
      would drop to TL4 as fuel supplies run out.

      Note that if TL degredation occurs, see step 1.

   3) Population cross-section: is there enough varied manpower to maintain
      the knowledge base?

      If you have a varied skill base, assuming #2 above is not kicking in,
      you should be able to maintain your TL.  However, worlds that are
      highly specialized in one area and import techs to handle other
      areas are going to be screwed.

      
So what\'s the gist?  Mabye hard times should be used to clear out the
cruft of old traveller\'s world generation.

First off, any world with a population of 4 or less is highly suspect.
They are either a freshly planted colony, or a dying one.  In either case,
the loss of trade would most likely finish them off.  Population 5 is
the bare minimum I would say is self-sufficient, assuming no adverse
environmental conditions or resource problems.  I have seen at least one
world with a population of 10 stone-age barbarians.  If you try to tell me
that this world should have remained unchanged even through the time of
spinward marches without dying off, I\'ll slap you silly. :)

Second, some population/world size ratios are very bogus given some of the
TLs provided.  In my world generator program I had a correction algorthm based
on world land surface and TL.  The result was the maximum population
capable.   If Usable Land Index (ULI) equals Size+Size+(10-Hydro),
Then for every +1 change in ULI, increase the population maximum by +1.
Likewise for a decrease of 1, decrease population maximum.

Also, increase the maxmimum by +1 for every TL above 0.

If the world is an cold planet, subtract .176 from the total.  Ice worlds
subtract .477 from the total.  Hot worlds add .095 to the total.

Table of logs below:

   Code Value   Code Value   Code Value   Code Value   Code Value   Code Value
     0  -.477     2   .301     4   .602     6   .778     8   .903    10   1.00
     1   .000     3   .477     5   .699     7   .845     9   .954

For example, Earth has an ULI of (.903*2)+(.477) or 2.283.  Our example
world above has an ULI of (.699*2)+.699 or 2.097.  Within reason, it
has about the same area.  However, a Size 1, Hydro 0 world has an ULI of
1, so it\'s base maximum should be reduced by 1.

I figure a base maximum of 5 for an Earth sized planet for TL 0 
savages.  Your milage may vary.

Note to GDW: Please decrease the granularity in population codes!
a factor of 10 is a bit much -- How about a factor of "about 2"?

i.e. 0 = none
   1=1   2=2, 3=5, 4=10, 5=20, 6=50, 7=100, 8=200, 9=500, 10=1000,
  11=2000, 12=5000, 13=10,000 and so on?

Also, keep in mind some minimums of popualations.  Use some sort of
table-driven means rather then straight die values (i.e. 2d-2).

In my mind, minor worlds range from (old traveller) pop 5-8, major ones
from 9 and up.  At pop 4 you have the beginnings of a colony, or the end
of one.  3 and less should be some sort of dependant installation .

Cynthia, did you know that the TML PBEM is still going strong, with over
three dozen players?  When Richard decided to throw in the towel, Metlay
and I picked it up and ran with it.

James is still helping coordinating the TML PBEM.  Specifically, he handles
all the PBEM mail alias administration, which keeps player connectivity at
a pleasantly high level and significantly reduces the amount of bookkeeping
required by us as Referees.

Close.  Actually, once the aliases were created, the players no longer
have to maintain their own, individual lists of PBEM E-mail addresses.
If a player wants to make public move, they just send it to pbemall.
If they only want their move to go to the characters aboard a specific
ship (the Paladin, for example), they just mail to pbempaladin.  All
moves (public and private) get archived automatically.  Then, at the
cut-off point for a turn, the referee just copies the archive, edits
and formats it, and posts the result to all the players and to the TML.

Private is a good word for the PBEM, but \'closed\' would be more accurate.
The current TML PBEM is a \'closed\' game, in that new players need referee
approval to join.  People who are on the waiting list to join, or who
just want to eavesdrop, can request to be added to the pbemlisteners alias.

The current players will be starting the \'92 season with opening moves
next week.  The first official turn of the year (Turn 92.00) will be
posted to the TML, in 3 parts, next Monday, February 3rd.

    'body' => 'Here\'s some ideas I\'ve been kicking around.

Question:  Just how do the different alien races design their
control panels.  We kinda take it for granted that they are
different, but just how different are they?  For simplicity\'s
sake I just took a look at pilot stations.

SOLOMANI	(start off simple right?)
	Solomani (and most Imperial) flight controls generally
consist of stick, throttle, and rudder pedals.  The stick is
usually mounted in the center of the console, but is sometimes on
the left side, while the right hand generally controls the
throttle.  This allows the co-pilot or navigator (generally
seated on the right) to be able to reach the throttle.  If the
pilot were incapacitated, the co-pilot can easily take control. 
If the stick is on the left side, it and the throttle are mounted
in the arms of the acceleration couch.  This allows the pilot to
rest his arms on the chair.  This can be nice when you don\'t have
inertial compensators working.
	On most ships, especially fighters, all combat funtions are
mounted on the stick and throttle.  This allows a pilot to
conduct all combat operations without having to move his hands to
different controls.  This design philosophy is known as HOTAS. 
(Hands On Throttle And Stick)
	Darrians tend to use Solomani control design philosophy,
though with a greater emphisis on center mounted sticks.  This is
because of the high proportion of ambidextrousness and left
handedness in Darrian gene pools.

VILANI
	Vilani controls are a bit more automated.  Auto pilots tend
to be a bit more sophisticated (and are heavily relied on)  The
control lay out is on the clumsy side.  Engineers opted for a
single design to ease training of pilots and to avoid their
having to study their ship to understand what is going on.  Thus
the same control panel exists on the Vilani Fat Trader as exists
on their most sophisticated fighters.  The compromise design is
good, but any compromise in engineering tends to lessen
performance.
	Vilani attitude controls look like a cross bettween a
control yoke and motorcycle handle bars.  Rudder pedals are not
present as they are in Solomani designs, and yaw control is
linked to the handle bars.  The bars control yaw in a similar
manner to motorcycle bars.  (This makes a cross controlled \'slip\'
maneuver somewhat more difficult in Vilani aircraft)  But it
simplifies the controls for most normal flights.  The throttle is
mounted on the left handle bar as if it were a motorcycle.

ZHODANI
	Almost all Zhodani pilots come from the noble ranks.  Flight
controls for their ships are open for flicking.  Thus the psi-
trained Zhodani pilot may change the ship\'s attitude, throttle
settings, and weapons by flicking.  Special safe guards are in
place to prevent outside psionic interference in the piloting of
the ship.  Up to and including a psi-shield surrounding the
pilot\'s station.  This is demonstrated in the Shivva class patrol
frigate and her fighters.  The fighter pilots are open to
telepathic contact from their flight controller, but the flight
controller can not affect flight controls of the fighter.
	There also exist manual controls for all craft.  Not all
pilots are nobles.  The enlisted pilots use the manual controls. 
Also proles operating grav vehicles and the like have a need for
manual controls.  While one would think that manual flight
controls would be of lesser quality because of the depencance on
psi-controls, this is far from the truth.  With their wealth of
insight into the human mind, data presentation among the Zhodani
is a fine art.  Screens with flight data are very well presented
in such a manner so as not to swamp the pilot with data. 
However, manual controls do tend to recieve secondary attention
in Zhodani cockpit design.
	Controls are generally mounted on the arms of the flight
acceleration couch.  The stick is generally mounted on the left,
and the throttle on the right.  Often times, with a Psionic pilot
in command, the controls are stowed inside the chair arms and,
with a press of a switch, can be deployed in emergencies.
	Yaw control is subsumed into the stick in a rotational
manner.  Turn the stick to the right and the ship yaws right. 
This last is a reflection of how manual flight controls are
considered secondary.

VARGR
	Vargr flight controls do not follow general lines making it
difficult to generalize.  But, their control systems tend to be
similar to human designs at least where hands are concerned. 
Their degitigrade stance makes their foot controls quite
different.  Rudder pedals are rare, and yaw control tends to be
absorbed into the stick as Vilani and Zhodani designs.
	Aslan control systems are sometimes copied by Vargr.

ASLAN
	Aslan flight controls are a set of half gloves set into the
arms of the acceleration couch.  They look somewhat like large
balls on the ends of the chair arms.  The hand is placed atop the
ball in deep indentations in it for the hand.  (Picture a big wax
ball with a hole the shape of your hand melted into it.)  (Rather
like Hiver controls with deeper indendations)
	This design meshes with the Aslan philosophy that the ship
is but an extension of the pilot.  The \'gloves\' make the ship
part of him.  The ship follows the motion of the hand.  The
extension of the dew-claw fires the ships weapons on ship\'s where
the pilot is in control of the guns.  A similar control is for
the aiming and firing of ship\'s weapons.
	Attitude control is controlled by both hands on separate
controls.  With roll and pitch on one hand and yaw on the other. 
Throttle control is in foot pedals.

DROYNE
	Droyne controls are one of the most unusual.  Attitude
controls are mounted beside the pilot.  They are low level infra-
red sensors that sense the position of the pilot\'s wings and
tail.  Though the Droyne generally have great difficulty in
flying, they do still possess the equipment for rudimentary
flight, and the instincts to do so(though buried).  To raise the
nose of the ship, the pilot would increase the angle of attack of
his wings.  The sensors see the change in wing angle and perform
the maneuver.  If the pilot raises his right wing, the ship will
bank left, and so on.
	Throttle controls are more conventional:  a lever mounted in
the center of the panel.
	The Ael Yael, while unable to build ships will commonly
adapt control panels to this type of configuration.


HIVER
	The Hiver controls are balls mounted with control studs. 
This is the form best suited \'ergonomically` to their limbs. 
Hiver controls are very difficult for anyone but a hiver to
operate.  Thus, many of their ships employ dual control panels,
to allow for a member race to use them.  The Federation Member
control panels are similar to Aslan designs, though the
indentation in the control globes is not so deep as the Aslan
half gloves.  This arrangement allows the hiver better control
than he would mangage with a Solomani design.

K\'KREE
	The K\'Kree have probably the most bazarre arrangement of
attitude control.  The pilot lies in a couch arrangement with his
four hooves touching the floor.  By leaning in one direction or
another, the ship\'s attitude is changed.  It looks somthing like
flying a hang glider.  To roll left, lean left.  To lower the
nose:  lean forward.  To pull up:  lean back.  Yaw control is by
twisting the body to the right or left.  Throttle control is by
hand levers.
	The leaning method of attitude control dates back to the

Commentary:
   Gee, it looks like ship crews have taken a bit of a pay cut since the 5th
Frontier War! :)  To start with, I can\'t believe how badly broken the crew
salary rules are for MegaT.  A ship\'s medic can\'t even maintain SocSt 2 on
that salary.  Besides that, who would be foolish enough to put the lives of
frozen crew in the hands of a medic who knows darn well that they are 
getting paid just as much as he is just to stay in hibernation?
   The other idea I had involved the effects of _Hard Times_.  Has anybody
tried to figure out how bad the damage is over a given area, say a subsector?
How many people get killed?  How far does the GPP fall?  How far does the
average tech level fall?  I don\'t have _Hard Times_, but I\'ve been hearing
comments about HiPop planets losing a population digit -- we\'re talking about
*billions* of sentient beings here!  This is the sort of blow that it is
hard to recover from, even in an intact Imperium.
   How much cooperation was there between Imperial planets even before 
everything fell to pieces?  I get the idea that in many cases neighboring
worlds didn\'t do all that much to help each other out.  There always seemed
to be worlds in dire straits near powerful, hi-tech worlds that just didn\'t
seem to lift a finger to help.  Might the Imperium have discouraged local
"Good Samaritans"?
   In other words, we\'ve looked at hard numbers for the Imperium before
the Rebellion, but we haven\'t yet looked at numbers for the Imperial worlds
after a region broke up (according to _Hard Times_ anyway).  It might be
interesting to see how bad it is over, say, a subsector.

:James and Richard, since you have coordinated this sort of thing
:before, I would appreciate any tips, suggestions, caveats, advice you
:might have.  Tentatively, following the lead of a very good friend of
:mine who runs a play-by-surface-mail fantasy rpg, I intend to (a) NOT
:run things at the tactical level (i.e., we won\'t get tied up going
:blow-by-blow over the mail), (b) have a multi-generational campaign, and
:(c) allow the players to be movers & shakers if it happens to work out
:that way.  

I agree completely with all of the above.  My primary rule has been
to let the players tell their characters to (try to) do anything
the player can thinkd of.  How it works out is the GM territory, though.

My second rule has been to try to remain impartial (like the "real")
universe, rather than adversarial. 

My third rule is "don\'t give the GM ideas."  Metlay says it\'s his
first. :=)

Finally, I guess, don\'t be a slave to the game clock.  See what is happening,
and try to have it make sense in some kind of time frame, rather than
sticking to the rules.


:By private, I *think* that I mean "handling things the same way the
:Richard\'s PBEM handled it", but I\'m not sure.  What I mean is that
:player turns would be sent to me, and my responses sent back to them via
:e-mail, not posted to the TML for public view.  Am I correct in
:believing that that is the way Richard handled it?  However, if most
:players agree, and TML readers are interested, I would post a synopsis
:of current events in the PBEM to the TML for all to read.  Opinions,
:anyone?

I started out trying this "double blind" approach, in which players
would not know whose character was whose.  You might be able to do it,
if you keep the number of players really small (six or less?).  I found
I couldn\'t handle the volume because of mail delays, schedule problems,
people talking ot each other "above board" i.e. person-to-person anyway,
etc.   So I let it open up to direct character-to-character mailings,
on the proviso I got a copy.  (I didn\'t always, BTW.)

So it\'s a possibility, but hard to do, and it messes with your real life.

I found TMLers are ALWAYS interested in a synopsis of what\'s happening
in various games, so by all means post.

Finally, I found a totally different kind of satisfaction and gratification
running the PBEM than I do with table-top adventures.  It\'s truly NEAT
to have people from all over the world get to know each other, to have
fun together, and to create together.  I hope you enjoy it as much.
If you want any other help, just ask.

They sure won\'t, but then, most of them can\'t support themselves WITH
interstellar trade.  The Ireland you describe would have no source of
Imperial credits to buy anything from offworld (in standard MT).
As to the question of lack of iron/nickel/metals in general that Ireland
has, most PLANETS have whole solar systems attached.  Many have ateroid
belts out there.  As was pointed out by Pournelle years ago, ONE medium
sized asteroid has more metal than the entire world\'s output for any
year in history.  Lack of raw materials should never be a problem.

That\'s a very good question, which we have been asking ourselves since
we got hold of Hard Times.  (actually, I have been wondering since MT
came out, as MT made it MUCH harder to build a ship which could have a
real chance of being an effective pirate)

A rocket that rides down on it\'s jet can\'t be made reusable? Don\'t be
ridiculous!  Yes, I studied aerospace engineering, too.  While building
a realworld rocket HERE that can do that is pushing the limits of
reality, MOST Imperial worlds are considerably smaller than Terra, with
correspondingly lower surface G.  The mass-ratios required for
orbit-powered deorbit are MUCH more reasonable than here.
BTW, my beef with the LALV was NOT the concept.  It was the rules that
made the LALV less functional than a rocket.  Notice that under those
rules, I could build a rocket that could do a powered orbit-powered
deorbit with less fuel (by a factor of 5-7) than a LALV would require
just to get UP, much less back down. (GAWD, another run-on sentence
breaks free!)

Yes, I know about them. Hopefully, they\'ll have a specific impulse

attempt to salvage the idea without rewriting the entire set of Low Tech
Spacecraft rules.

Indications were that they were passed out for free, and that every
world in the Imperium had them in their databases.  Who cares whether
they still come in?  You already got the ones for TL5-15!

It takes more than an army and navy to be a superpower.  Standard of
living might be nice, too.  ANd they STILL have all those things, as you
say.   USSR 70+ years and counting / Imperium dead after 5- years???
And I am sure that the number of people who will be willing to move away
from their homeworlds are not appreciably greater than the number of
people today who leave their home countries to seek better
opportunities.  Some do, for sure, but if they all did, then Germany
would have been depopulated after WW2.  VERY few people can pull up
their roots and walk away from everything they\'ve ever known for the
CHANCE of better times elsewhere.  Most will stay and work for better
times here.

So, how much less does it cost to buy the wheel from an oxcart in the
USA today than it does to buy a tire for your automobile?  Wheels are
cheaper if you have a wheel factory, but if all your factories produce
Grav modules, wheels are going to be EXPENSIVE imports.  Cynthia has
designed several Grav vehicles that retail for about the same as a
modern automobile (use fuel cells and solar panels, and watch the price
of your speeder plummet!).  I doubt that wheeled vehicles would be
competitive.  Especially given the detail everyone else (GDW included)
seems to overlook.  NO ROADS!   The wheeled vehicle economy will never
work without roads for them to drive on (yes, four wheel drive offroad
vehicles exist - have you ever seen a four-wheel drive off-road
18wheeler?)  The roads would cost FAR more (llok at how much the USA
spends on them) than the grav vehicle factory ever could.

Actually, given MT rules set, fusion plants are one of the most
practical ways of getting energy.  Again, tooling up to build the
alternatives costs money (lots of it).  If you have to have money,
anyway, build something that is better than obsolete junk.
 
>If the governement stops subsidizing the local fusion plant because it

Why should the government subsidize local fusion plants?  They cost
somewhere in the range of 33Cr per Kw.  In the USA, power plants of all
types cost in the neighborhood of $1000 per KW.
 
>The soviets are experinceing this now with their reactors (according to
>recent news reports). Their refurbishing old parts, but who knows

Probably forever, or until teh fuel cores burn out.  No components of a
nuclear plant are all that hard to make, if you have basic machine
tools.
 
>BTW where are hi-tech, low water worlds getting their hydrogen?
 
Probably from a moon (theirs, or another planet insystem\'s) with ice. 
Or from a carbonaceous-chrondite asteroid.  A 3Km ateroid would ahve
about 500,000,000 tons of hydrogen in it.  That could keep a terawatt
worth of fusion plants running for maybe 1500 years, even a MT\'s abysmal
efficiencies.

Neither are most of theirs.  And why didn\'t this happen in the
Depression, if it so likely?

Check out World Builder\'s Handbook for guidelines on who has the
High-Tech.  In most TL15 worlds, most people would be living at TL14 (or
perhaps TL13).  Which is still a whole lot higher than TL10!  Even if
90% of it evaporated overnight, they probably could rebuild all of it in
5 years.
And why should you stop being wealthy because the Stock Market crashed? 
As Sam Walton said after losing $500,000,000 in the Stock Market
collapse a few years ago, "it was paper yesterday, it\'s still paper
today."
If you own a factory, it won\'t evaporate just because the Stock Market
does.  If you have a factory, and no cash, BARTER!  Your people will
work for room and board if times are that bad, and you can provide them
by trading the products of your factories for the products of other
people\'s factories.

Good point.  Though notice the WBH again.  Most of the state-of-the-art
is in the hands of the elite on most worlds anyway.  But Germany\'s
general TL was higher in 1939 than in 1919, in any case.  Remember the
Volkswagon?  Remember the Sanger antipodal bomber?
And as I said on a post this past AM, we (Cynthia and I) expect to see a
LOT of Htlers and Stalins and Roosevelts in the next few years of the
Imperium.

I doubt that the smart sophonts did, but the Vilani heritage CANNOT be
that strong, since the same problem existed in teh Long Night.  Plenty
of time for evolution to wipe out that particular mind-set.  Note the
troubles Vland has had in reinstating it even in their own sector.
 
And if it were common, then the lads left behind would just know how to
do one thing, which WILL NOT BE how to build wheeled vehicles!  They are
far more likely to have cookbook knowledge of Grav engineering than of
wheeled vehicle design (which they haven\'t used in 11,000 years).

The five Tl drop is ludicrous. The assumption that such a drop would
last for more than a VERY short period is even more ludicrous.
HOWEVER, the MOST LUDICROUS THING TRAVELLER (in any incarnation) HAS
EVER DONE IS TO ASSUME THAT "PEASANTS" WILL BE COMMON IN THE
IMPERIUM!!!!!!!!

    'body' => 'Here are the conversion notes for Traveller to GURPS, for the archives.
- ----

What follows are some fairly straightforward conversion rules for
basic Traveller (either books 1,2,3, or _The_Traveller_Book_) to GURPS, 
mainly for characters:

Stats:
- ----

Strength = strength +3
Dexterity = dexterity +3
Intelligence = intelligence +3
Health = endurance +3

If you feel such numbers are too low, use either the stat +3 or (stat*1.5)
[rounded up], whichever is higher

see below for education and social standing

Skills:
- ----
Level zero gives the skill at whatever level a half point would give
Level one in a skill equals the skill at (stat) 
Level two in a skill equals the skill at (stat) +1
Level three in a skill equals the skill at (stat) +2
and so on...

For Traveller skills that encompass multiple GURPS skills, each
skill is gained at the indicated level, with some exceptions.
Medical skill does not grant any other skills except first-aid
until it reaches level 3, when Diagnosis and Surgery become available
at two levels lower than the medical skill. Jack-of-all-trades gives
4 skill points per level to the character\'s education pool (see below), 
or, optionally, it reduces all stat defaults by 1 (but no better than
a -2 penalty) per level of J-O-T. Most weapon skills are fairly 
explanatory. However, revolver, auto-pistol, and body pistol are all
Guns(Pistol), rifle and carbine are Guns(Rifle), blade and dagger are
Knife, sword is Shortsword, cutlass is Broadsword, broadsword is
Two-Handed Sword, and foil is Fencing. A character with skill in the foil
who also has blade or dagger skill may take the Main Gauche skill
(see Swashbucklers or Martial Arts) rather than Knife. A character with
brawling may take the GURPS Brawling at the appropriate level, or take
either Judo or Karate at skill-2. For starship combat, the areas
within Gunnery skill are Lasers, Missiles, and Sandcasters. Ship\'s Boat
is Piloting(small craft or starfighter), and pilot is Piloting(starship).
Also, it is recommended that Piloting gets the same IQ bonuses as does Guns, 
though this is optional. Electronics and Mechanical must be broken down 
into specialities. Engineering includes Mechanic(Warp/Hyper/Jumpdrives), 
Mechanic(Starship drives), and Mechanic (storage batteries/capacitors). 
Liason is roughly the same as Savior-Faire.

Also, every character has a number of \'free\' points equal to their
Traveller education to spend on skills. These points should be used on
general skills that Traveller does not include (Chemistry, Biology,
Area Knowledge, Cooking, etc) and that the character should logically
have. They may also be used to improve a character\'s intelligence
(see below for details).

Optionally (and especially if the character was made under the older
Traveller rules), you may want to allow the character to add 4 points
of skill for every term served. Unlike points from education, these
points may be used for any skill that the character could have reasonably
learned in their service. Also, they may be used to increase a character\'s
stats, but at a cost penalty of double normal cost (so going from IQ 10 to
11 would cost 20, not 10, points). Points gained from time in service may
also be used for Contacts, Allies, Patrons, or Favors.

Advantages and disadvantages:
- ----
Characters with a social standing over 7 recieve one level of
Status per two points over. A character with a SS of 5 or less has
Status -1. A SS of 3 or less also should have a Social Stigma.
Characters, regardless of the rank they may have achieved while in
a service, do not have to pay for the (Military) Rank, unless they
still hold such rank (such as being in the reserves, etc).
Characters who get a ship as a mustering out benefit must pay for
a 10 point Unusual Background or (in the case of scouts) as the 
IISS as a patron (though the scout does own them a small duty).
The Traveller Aid Society counts as a 10 point Patron (of sorts).
A character that failed his survival roll may take an appropriate
disadvantage (one arm, one eye, severe phobia, etc.). Reputation,
good or bad, may be assigned as needs be. Enemies and allies 
depend on the character\'s prior play (if any). If such allies or
reputation was gained while in service, it must be purchased with the
points from terms served.

Characters may take additional advantages or disadvantages, but the total 
value of these should not be higher than 0. Also, such advantages and 
disadvantages should be appropriate to the character, his/her background, 
and race (for example, a droyne would have Winged Flight (30pts) and Night 
Vision (10pts), but it also has Hollow Bones (-20pts)), though *racial* 
advantages and disadvantages do not have to balance (GM\'s call).

If you use J-O-T to reduce stat defaults, count it as a 5 point advantage
per level.

Weapons:
- ----
Most firearms convert over fairly easily. In general, use an appropriate
weapon from GURPS for the Traveller weapon (though remember that lasers
use bulky power packs). Some guidelines (using those in _The_Traveller_
Book_) using weapons in GURPS Basic Set, 3rd edition:
	body pistol: walther ppk *	automatic pistol: browning HP
	revolver: s&w m10 .38-cal	carbine: semi-auto m-16
	rifle: semi-auto FN-FAL		auto rifle: fully-auto FN-FAL
	shotgun: rem m870 (10 shot)	blade: large knife
	dagger: small knife		foil: rapier
	cutlass: broadsword		sword: short sword
	broadsword: two-handed sword	bayonet: small knife/spear
	cudgel: club			
	laser rifle: as listed, but 4d dam, and shots 100 from 10lb pack
	laser carbine: as laser rifle, but 3d dam, 2/3 range, and 50 shots
		from a 5lb powerpack
	* -- this version is almost entirely made of plastic, including
	the ammunition; range and damage are 1/2 normal

Those intrested in converting weapons from Book 4: Mercenary will
need to do their own work. GURPS High-Tech and Ultra-Tech (tech levels
6-9) would be very useful. I also have a file of near-future, SF, and
historic weapons for use in GURPS (TL5-8, numbering about 30) if you may 
be intrested (a_copeab@ccsvax.sfasu.edu).

Armor:
- ----
The following PD and DR should be used:
	jack: PD 2 DR 2		mesh: PD 3 DR 4 (PD 0 DR 1 vs impailing)
	cloth: PD 4 DR 12	reflect: none (PD 6 vs lasers)
	ablat: PD 2 DR 3 (PD 5 vs lasers)
	vacc suit: PD 4 DR 12
	combat armor/battle dress: PD 6 DR 30


Starting Money:
- ----
Because of the extremes that a character can start with, this is
difficult to evaluate. Basically, consider an average wealth level
to be Cr 4000. This may be upped or lowered as the GM sees fit.
Any Wealth advantage or disadvantage should be based off this value.

Character Points:
- ----
In general, do not try to force characters into point totals. If, after
converting characters, there is a large difference in point totals (and
at the GM\'s option) characters more than 50 points under the highest
totalled character may be given points to get them up to within 50 points.
Distribution of points is up to the GM, and should not be used for stats
or skills.

General Tech Level:
- ----
If bringing Traveller characters into a GURPS Space campaign, consider
skills to be Tech Level 9-10. If you are converting a Traveller campaign
to GURPS rules, it is strongly advised that you keep the Traveller tech 
levels as-is. Up to TL7, both scales are similar. After that, every two
Traveller tech levels ups the GURPS tech level by one (ex. Traveller TL15
is roughly GURPS TL11).

Starships:
- ----
In a Traveller universe, I would recommend keeping Traveller ships as-is, 
unless you really feel like trying to rebuild every ship. If the Traveller 
characters are being transplanted into another universe (ie, different 
campaign background), use the GURPS Space rules.

Starship Combat:
- ----
If you use Traveller ships, and want to use the fast starship combat
system in GURPS Space:
	(1) Traveller ships have an armor DF of 0; every 3% of the hull
	dedicated to armor gives DF 1 (or divide High Guard armor value by 3)
	(2) Multiply the ships\'s tonnage by 13.5 to get its cubic yard
	displacement (it isn\'t exact, but...).
	(3) Traveller lasers are considered heavy lasers and the missiles
	are heavy missiles
	(4) Sandcasters are used in defensive fire; they are treated like
	anti-missile lasers versus missiles; against lasers, roll to-hit --
	for each point gunner skill is made by, reduce the incoming laser
	firepower by 10%, plus 10% (but never to less than 10%, unless a
	critical success is rolled).

I hereby challenge all members of the TML to come up with a scenario more

coming out with...

Below are a few ideas...

Here\'s one I stole from The Hitch Hiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy

The Shoe Event Horizon...
Everyone in the Imerium is so depressed they are all looking down.  They
notice their shoes.  To cheer themselves up they buy new pairs.  Now, with
everybody buying more shoes, the shoe makers reinvest their money into more
production.  More shoes:  More shoe shops.  But if everyone has new shoes,
no one will buy more, thus the shoe shops have to regain their money by
introducing fashions where shoes are made badly so that they fall apart.
With shoes lasting only a short time and fashions changing constatnly, everyone
buys more shoes.  More shoes:  More Shoe shops.
	The cycle goes round and round until you reach the Shoe Event Horizon.
The whole economy overbalances.  It becomes economically impossible to open any
kind of store other than a shoe store.  These existing shoe stores sell shoes
that no one can wear.  The result:  Collapse, Famine, Ruin.
	Survivors (if any) eventually evolve into birds and never put their
feet on the ground again.


Ok, here\'s my original contribution:

Dulinor releases his secret weapon on Core...

A million ton cargo ship sneaks through Cores defences and comes in on a
Kamikazie run headed straight at the planet.

Valiantly, Lucan\'s SDB\'s swarm over the ship and destroy it, but not before it
releases it\'s deadly cargo.  On the surface of Core laser batteries act as
point defence weapons attacking the incoming projectiles, but unbeknownst to
them, they are playing right into Dulinor\'s hands...

For the projectiles are hundreds of millions of tons of aerosol deoderant cans!
The lasers hit the cans breaking them open releasing the cloroflorocarbons into
space.  But the cloud still has the momentum of the ship, and some cans still
get through and burn up in the outer atmosphere!

Core\'s ozone layer is GONE!  Sun tan lotion prices skyrocket!  Panic ensues as
crowds fight over the last few drops of Sun block 50 million!  Within a few
days every one on Core has a leathal case of skin cancer.  Dermatologists
are overwhelmed!  Riots ensue, and every one dies horribly just a few meters
from the last dermotology clinic still accepting outpatients.

Meanwhile, Dulinor\'s sector is in ruins.  It took the entire sector\'s supply of
deoderant to supply that assault.  Dulinor\'s worlds die of environmental
damage caused by excessive body oder.

And Antares. How the h... did Antares get in the same sorry
state as the rest of the factions? Didn\'t they get an alliance
with the Julian League? Especially hard to understand is the
Frontier and Wilds areas _between_ Antares and the League. Even
if Lucan kicked the shit out of the spinward part of Antares,
surely the coreward part would be protected by the League?

They do have their internal squabbles which might prevent that.
Here is my bid for a possible developement:

The Solomani Confederation will steamroller out over all the former
Solomani Autonomous Region. It\'s only a matter of time. The heoric
defenders of Diaspora and Old Expanses may have stopped the initial
Solomani fleets, but the Confederation can produce more. But then
Confederation expansion will slow or even halt. There are factions
who will not want the Confederation to continue, and there are areas
like Vega that will be very hard to assimilate (It\'s my belief that
Terra itself could be a problem for another two generations). And
there\'ll alway be a big slice of the Confederation fleet tied down
guarding the Hierate border.

In the rest of the former Imperium the Safes will consolidate while
small polities will mushroom in the Outlands and the Wilds. Once
consolidated the Safes will try to reexpand, but no faction will
have the strength to do so solely by conquest. Think 17th Century.
The Great Powers will conquer some individual worlds and polities;
others will be bribed, threathend or cajoled into giving trade
concessions, allowing factories, outposts and colonies. The strongest
polities will be worth helping just to prevent another Great Power
from gaining it. And what one Power gains another will try to take
from it. Alliances will shift between Powers. Daibei and Delphi may
war over control of Massila, but they will ally against Confederation
or Core meddling. Some polities may even grow big enough to rival the
smaller Great Powers, or they may form Confederations of their own.

All in all it could be a very exiting time to adventure in. But it
will not be a second Long Night.

IMO a game like Traveller needs both rich, secure, civilized places with
an economy that makes it possible for player characters to acquire a
starship and lonely, wild places where the thug and the privateer roam
and the only law is the one in your laser cannon.

Also IMO you\'ll be a bit short of the second type of place in a universe
where a single high-population world can finance enough naval vessels to
put a squadron of Azhantis in every starsystem in a subsector  -  at least
not when you have two or three high-pop worlds per subsector on the average.

You can of course make the pirates tough enough to deal with Azhantis, but
that rather defeats the purpose. A pirate should be a threat to player
characters, true, but it should be a survivable threat.

(You can of course give the player characters a ship that is equal to a
pirate that is tough enough to deal with Azhantis. That will give them a
crew of several hundred NPCs to deal with... ;-)

There\'s two ways to attack this problem: You can reduce the money each
world contributes to the navy, and you can reduce the amount of ship the
navy gets for each credit. I\'m working on something wrt the first approach,
but in this posting I\'d like to present some of my ideas for the second and
would like to hear your comments.

1) SALARIES: _Trillion Credit Squadron_ instructs us to ignore crew salaries.
   I\'d rather regard it as a legitimate drain on the naval budget. After all,
   money spent on salaries can\'t be spent on ships too. Civilian crew sala-
   ries runs from 6000 Cr/year to 40.000/year or more, so an average salary
   of 20-25.000 Crimp/year dosen\'t seem excessive. If we furthermore look on
   each shipboard crew position as representing two or three or perhaps even
   four persons  -  the rest being trainees, trainers, planetside staff
   etc.  -  and also include the cost and maintenance of all planetside
   installations, then it won\'t be too much to say that each shipboard crew
   position cost 100.000 Crimp/year. This will increase the effective cost of
   each ship by 1 MCrimp per crew position (including marines). (Each credit
   cut out of the yearly budget will mean 10 credits less to the initial
   investment).

2) INERTIAL COMPENSATORS: I\'d like to increase the size and power
   requirements of inertial compensators to be proportional to the
   acceleration they are supposed to compensate for. Civilian ships
   usually makes do with a 1G manouver drive, so they wouldn\'t be
   affected, but a naval ship with a 4G drive would need 4 times the
   amount of compensators it needs today. My (still untested) rule
   would go something like this:

   The amount of inertial compensators needed by a ship varies with
   the capacity of it\'s manouver drive. The data shown is for a
   ship with a 1G drive. Multiply this by the G value of the ship
   manouver drive.

   Power  Volume  Weight  Price   Units
   0.020  0.010   0.020   250 Cr  per kiloliter of hull.

   Variant 1: Multiply by 1.25 the G value (the compensators need to be
              able to handle a switch from full ahead to 1/4 astern).

   Variant 2: Multiply by twice the G value (the compensators need to be
              able to handle a switch from full ahead to full astern).


3) PSIONIC SHIELDING: Despite the known limits of psionic powers
   (maximum range extreme orbit), no naval commander would like
   to bet his ship on that. Who can be sure that some freaks can\'t
   perform at longer ranges? In any case ships often engage at
   less than extreme orbit range (that\'s 5 million km, after all).
   Ships up against the Zhodanis will be shielded as a matter of
   course, but other ships will be too, even those up against the
   Imperium or the Solomani Confederation, regardless of the
   prevailing stance against psionics in both states. What is that
   to people who uses the word \'threat\' about capability instead of
   intention? What military mind would trust an opponent to refrain
   from using psionic adepts, regardless of what line said opponent
   feeds his own civilians? Thus naval ships will be psionically
   shielded "just in case".

   I\'ve tentatively put the cost of psionic shielding equivalent to
   that of electronic masking. Tech level is 12.

   Power  Volume  Weight  Price    Units
   0.001  0.020   0.010   5000 Cr  per kiloliter of hull.

   One question here is what the shielding actually shields against. A
   psionic shield helmet prevents thoughts being read by creating an elec-
   trical field that interferes with brainwave frequencies. Shielding a
   ship in the same way will be easy. But will such a field stop tele-
   portation too? If not, will anything shield against teleportation? IMO
   a naval ship _must_ be either be teleport-shielded or have a large
   number of internal security troops. Imagine the trouble a squad of
   battle-suited marines could do after teleporting aboard a battleship.
   Talk about cost-efficiency!

   My own inclination is to say that a brainwave shield will interfere
   with the targeting aspect of teleportation and will thus protect
   against it.


4) DURABILITY: Tactically this reliance on annual maintenance is not a
   good thing. If a war is just 5 jumps away from a naval vessel\'s base,
   it will be travelling to a from annual maintenance 3 months out of
   every year. Nor is it very good strategically, since it restricts
   the size of the fleet you can concentrate anywhere to the capacity
   of the local shipyards. I propose two things here: Firstly some
   maintenance tasks that the ship engineers can perform, that will keep
   the ship flying without negative DMs. Perhaps rolled quarterly and
   increasing one level in difficulty for each full year since last
   overhaul. A good engineer should be able to keep a ship flying for two
   or three years before the negative DMs for missed overhauls actually
   began to apply. (No, this will not mean that ships can get away with
   only bi-yearly overhauls. For every year since the last overhaul a ship
   would need to spend two weeks on the next. Thus a ship could skip the
   overhaul one year in an emergency, but it would have to pay twice the
   amount next year).

   Secondly allow a ship to be build with more durable materials and
   higher system redundancies, if one is willing to pay. Perhaps one
   extra year for each 25% extra money spent. (The ship would still
   two weeks overhaul for each year since the last one, but a +25%
   ship could get spend 4 weeks every other year instead of 2 weeks
   every year (or should the ship get away with a two week overhaul?))

   Naval vessels would routinely be build for 5 year missions ;-), so
   they would cost double the price of an equivalent civilian ship.


Well, what do you think?

  I\'d favour the second approach: Finding ways of increasing the cost of
military ships without increasing the cost of civilian ships.

  This will, if done right, also cure another problem: The dilemma of 
30kt freighters and 30kt light cruisers. We all know that the Imperium need
a lot of 30kt freighters for the commerce to work. We also know that if it
is that easy to build 30kt ships we will get too many cruisers for the
pirates to handle. We also know that each one of those 30kt freighters can
mount a horrifying fire-power compared to a 400t corsair.

*********
  What I\'d like the Traveller universe to be is a place where traders on up
to 200kt, and fleet tankers of even larger tonnages are common, but where 
these ships have at most a handful of turrets and where a \'battleship\' is
somewhere on the order 20-30kt (destroyers: around 1 to 3kt, cruisers around
10kt, carriers around 30kt, but lightly armed).
  
  What do people think about this goal?
*********

> 1) SALARIES: _Trillion Credit Squadron_ instructs us to ignore crew salaries.

  Fortunately I didn\'t know this when I did the Naasakiira defences. IMHO this
is ludicrous. If we look at realworld examples, salaries is among the biggest
single expence posts for a military force. In the Naasakiira example, half 
their defence budget went to salaries. I\'ve forgotten what I computed an 
average salary to be, but it was more on the order of 10 to 20kCr than your
20-25k. So had I\'ve been using your cost-levels Naasakiira would have fallen
with or without TL15 help.

  Imagine the trouble of 4 Zhos teleporting aboard a Chrysantemum DE. I know,
Exactly that thing happened in one of my campaigns. The end result was a 
negotiated settlement where the Zhos got a free ride back to the Consulate. 
Both sides thought they had won on the deal:)

  Spoilsport:)

  But there are some troubles with teleporting to a ship in combat. The 
source and the destination ships must match vectors to prevent the teleportees
from becomming kinetic energy warheads, they must have a clear destination,
they will show up on all security sensors and they will have trouble 
naviating the ship when all hatches are closed and locked (since there is a
limit on the number of teleports in full combat armour and with weapons one
can do per day, even if one is the \'munchkin zhodani thought police commando
from hell\')

> 4) DURABILITY: Tactically this reliance on annual maintenance is not a

  5) MILITARY SPENDING COST INCREASE: If the Imperium has gigacreds to waste 
on a navy, the manufacturers will see to it that the price on military ships
skyrocket. So the Navy will pay more for a given ships than a civilian would.
This will probably be blamed on mil-specing, MCr4 coffemachines and so on.

  6) MORE EXPENSIVE HARDPOINTS: This will also cure the problem with 30kt 
freighters who have a missile turret on every hardpoint "since they are 
practically free compared to the cost of the ship". Each hardpoint should
cause a noticable percentage increase in hull cost and weight due to
reinforcements (This is BTW the reason why we don\'t see any supertankers
mounting 10 127mm naval guns today). A spinal mount should lead to such
extreme increases in hull weight and cost that it would be impossible to
make a spinal-mount armed vessel above, say 40kt, unthinkably expensive
between 30 and 40kt, and very expensive between 20 and 30kt.

  7) FIRECONTROL: If we make the cost of the firecontrol highly dependent on
the number of turrets or bays we can inflate the costs of large ships mounting
more turrets than the referee care for, and inflate the cost of military ships
in one fell swoop.

  9) MILITARY WEAPONS: Turrets and bays are more or less equal today. If the
effectiveness of turrets upon military vessels is lowered (due to armour?),
all military ships will be forced to have bays or spinals to be usable against
other military vessels. Then we let the prices for bay weapons and spinal 
mounts skyrocket to such levels that no civilian will afford them.
  Turret defences should not work very well against bay weapons and we should
probably introduce a series of bay lasers and sandcasters for military vessels.
  There will still be some turret weapons on military vessels, but their 
purpose would be to keep the civilian ships in line.

    'body' => 'Hello all,

after following the discussion on TML and after a weekend of working on designs,
here is my opinion to the problem (and three designes at the end):

At first I suggest a seperation in designs of Spaceships - vehicles which
do not touch an atmosphere - and Orbiter - which are designed to bring payload
to orbit. I think Orbiter should be designed using COACC rules, Spaceships
using Hard Times + Craft Design from the referee\'s manual.

But no matter using the COACC rules for an Orbiter results in a couple of
problems. To show the different problems, I will suggest designs, and show
the problems they include.

- ----
To build a cheap Orbital Transfer Vehicle the government of ....(please
insert world) a TL 7 world chooses to design a two stage vehicle. The first
stage should use air breathing engines to reach to the extreme point of
the atmosphere. There the second stage will be launched and engage its engines
to reach a low orbit or a "will be" low orbit space station. The second
stage is intended to carry 8 tons to orbit.
The calculation leads to 65 minutes to reach the extreme point of the
atmosphere using High Performance Turbofans and a thrust resulting in 2.73 g
acceleration. The upper stage is intended to use High Performance rockets at
3.9g acceleration for about 30 seconds. (Please remember High bypass Turbofans
are not available on TL 7.)
The result of this calculation, the following two designs are launched:

CraftID:	Sanger - Supersonic lower stage, TL 7, Cr=28,128,720
Hull:		1600/4000, Disp=1780, Config=1AF(Supersonic),
		Weight loaded=400tons, Armor=none
Power:		18 MW (drawn from engines), Endurance=99min
Locomotion:	4/10 High Performance Turbofans x 4, Thrust=1092 tons,
		Top=2800, Cruise=2100, Min=280, Agility=9
Communication:	Radio=Planetary x 2
Sensors:	Radar=regional (all weather)
Off/Def:	-
Control:	Computer=0bisx3, Computer enhanced Fly-by-Wire, 6 MP,
		Environment=basicEnv,basicLS
Accom:		Crew=4 (Pilot, Copilot, Engineer, Launch Operator),
		Complex Cockpit x 4, advanced ejection seats x 4
Other:		Fuel=164,000 liters (164 kl for an endurance of 99 minutes),
		Cargo=Subcraft=Orbiter= 40 tons
Please remember: the disp. of the upper stage orbiter is included in the
disp of this vehicle. So the real disp. is 1602 if you like.

CraftID:	Hermann Oberth - Orbit Vehicle, TL 7, Cr=7,031,440
Hull:		160/400, Disp=178, Config=1AF(Hypersonic STOL),
		Weight loaded=40tons, Armor=none
Power 1:	3.12 MW (drawn from engines), Endurance=2min
Power 2:	FuelCells(x2)=0.18 MW, Endurance=336h (=14 days)
		(This power plant supplies life support and electronic
		 equipment)
Locomotion:	4/10 High Performance Rocket (x4), Thrust=156tons,
		Top=3200kph, Cruise=2400kph, Agility=10, min=175 kph
Sensors:	Magnetic Sensor, Radiation Sensor
Commo:		Radio=Planetary, Regional(x2)  (for EVA)
Off/Def:	-
Control:	Computer=0bis(x3), Computer enhanced Fly-by-Wire, 6 MP,
		Environment=basicEnv,basicLS,extLS,AirLock
Accom:		Crew=4, (Pilot, Copilot, 2 Mission specialists)
		Complex Cockpit x 2, Passenger Section x 4 (some extra
		space for life on orbit), Rocket Escape Pod x 4
Other:	 	Fuel=3200 liters (Rocket), Fuel=330 liters (FuelCells),
		Cargo=8081.4 liters (=kg), Hvy Robotic Arm

The Cargo Bay can be opened to space to release satellites. The robotic
arm can be used to support launch sequences of satellites or to support
EVA (Extra Vehicular Activities).
- ----
Now the Problems:
I have used Computer enhanced Fly-by-Wire controls for both vehicles. As
a result, these controls needs lot of power. As I know from reality, APUs
(Auxiliar Power Units) supply about 300 KW of electric energies, even a
747-400 needs much less then 1 MW to support the control functions of its
Fly-by-System. I think the energy consumption of the COACC Controls are
to high. What is meant by "Controls" of COACC ?
I need fuel cells for the Orbiter. No other powerplant can be used, to support
the energy needs in an sealed environment. But Fuel Cells are at TL 10 refering
to the referees manual. Any comments ?

After I have finished this two designs, I looked on Hard Times for a second
time. They calculate the time to reach an LPO using the g-ratio (the weight
to thrust ratio) of the vehicle. But to calculate the time, to reach the
edge of the atmosphere using air breathing engines, they calculate 10 times
the time of a rocket launch. As a result, only the last 10% of the way to
the orbit had to be done by rockets. I conclude the following:
90% of a flight to orbit can be done using airbreathing engines.
That\'s the basic of the following design:
- ----
After calculating the Sanger two stage project, a smart engineer suggests
an alternative:

CraftID:	Space Train - One stage Orbital transfer Vehicle, TL 7,
		Cr 31,140,520
Hull:		1600/4000, Disp=1780, Config=1AF (Hypersonic STOL)
		Weight loaded=400tons, Armor=none
Power 1:	18 MW (drawn from engines), Endurance=500sec
Power 2:	Fuel Cell (x30), 2.7MW, Endurance=346h (>14days)
Loco 1:		4/10 High Performance Ramjet (x4), Thrust=1638 tons,
		Top=3300kph, Cruise=2475kph, min=175
Loco 2:		4/10 High Performance Rocket (x2), Thrust=819 tons,
		Top=2000kph, Cruise=1500kph, min=175
Commo:		Radio=FarOrbit(x2),Regional(x4)
Sensors:	Radar=regional(all weather), Magnetic Sensor,
		Radiation Sensor
Off/Def:	-
Control:	Computer=1bis x 3, Computer Enhanced Fly-by-Wire, 6MP,
		Environment=BasicEnv,BasicLS,ExtLS,AirLock
Accom:		Crew=8 (Pilot, Copilot, Engineer, Radio/Computer Operator,
		Passengers x 4), Complex Cockpit (x4),
		Passenger Section(x4), Rocket Escape Pods (x8)
Others:		Fuel 1=28kl (for Rocket, 200 sec Endurance),
		Fuel 2=42kl (for Ramjet, 300 sec Endurance),
		Fuel 3= 4150 liters(for Fuel Cells, 346 hours endurance)
		Cargo= 60 tons (exactly: 59957 kg)

The launch profile is the following:
The vehicle is launched vertically, so a launch site is a must. At first,
the Rockets burn for 30 seconds to kick the vehicle up to 800 kph where
at second the ramjets starts. The ramjet will lift the vehicle to the edge
of the atmosphere in about 250 seconds. There the rockets are restarted
and deliever the final kick of 52 seconds to reach the LPO.

1.Stage: Rocket:  30sec at 2.05g =>  5.8% of way to orbit
2.Stage: Ramjet: 248sec at 4.10g => 84.2%
3.Stage: Rocket:  51sec at 2.05g => 10.0%

The Fuel for the rockets is 200% of the requiered, so enough safty potential
is build in. The Fuel Capacity can be lowered to get more Cargospace.
This vehicle is MCr 5 cheaper than the two flight units of the Sanger Project
together. A second advantage is the fact, that this unit will carry 7 times
the payload of Sanger and has much more safty potential.
- ----

I have perverted the LALV rules to design the above vehicle. It is able
to reach an LPO in 330seconds or 5 1/2 minutes. And it can carry far more
payload than the Sanger vehicle above.
One more problem of the Hard Times rule is:
They do not think about the landing of the vehicle. They do not calculate
the Fuel needed for reentrance to atmosphere nor they think of the special
Hull a vehicles needs, which try to land aerodynamical and uses the atmosphere
as cheap brake.
As Rob Dean suggest in one of his last emails, we could include this problems
in the calculation of the Hull weight and price. The calculations above are
made without using this. The price of the 3 designs above are done,  strict
using COACC rules. That\'s because I think Hypersonic designes had to stand
heat similar to an landing shuttle (that\'s one of the problems of hypersonic
flight).

I\'m trying to build a complete Space Program. So I will design a space station
and some spaceships (using my definition, see above). Any suggestions to
the designes of this ships (Ion-cruiser, Lunar lander, Lunar Orbiter...)
are welcome.

That\'s all for the moment,

Bravo!  The Great Game lives again!


Scott\'s challenge:

I can see three ways to wreck the Imperium.  Two are relatively quick, one
would take 100+ years.  In ascending order of time requirement:

   1)  Yaskaydroy gets tired of the Imperium being a nuisance near his
pocket universe in Regina subsector, and proceeds to smash the Imperium,
though not so thoroughly as he did his children.  While he\'s at it, he
smashes the Hivers, Aslan, Vargr, Zhodani, Solomani, and anyone else in
space.  All High Pop worlds are destroyed, all ships over 5000 tons
likewise.  The Imperium starts over in a few years looking a lot more like
the Classic Traveller picture of reality (few ships, all small, etc).

   2)  Lucan\'s agents in Darrian learn the secret of the Star Trigger.  
Lucan orders the Star Trigger used against all his enemies (read:
EVERYONE).  During the Maghizes happening all over the Imperium at once,
civilization dies.  Things rebuild as before.    Difficulties:  it takes a
while for light to propogate through that much space.  This version would
take 20-50 years to complete the collapse, that much more to recover.
A variation of same:  Antares goes supernova (film at eleven).  The  pulse
has an effect on the whole of known space similar to the Maghiz.  Takes 500
years to complete, but knocks Lucan out in only 200.  

   3)  Use H. Beam Piper\'s excuse:  The worlds of the Imperium all become
self-sufficient when someone introduces a self-replicating robot factory. 
Interstellar trade collapses.  Everyone is out of work.  The economies all
go bust.  Spiral down into the Dark Ages.  Unfortunately, things wouldn\'t
happen that way (probably).  And it would take 200-300 years in any case.

I consider the second scenario most likely.  It would trash the Imperium id
a Star Trigger was used on the star of every High Pop world in the area
(don\'t forget the Solomani and Zhodani worlds).  Unfortunately, Lucan is
the only Leader crazy enough to do it, and is not real terribly likely to
get the secret away from the Darrians.  But it COULD happen.

I tend to agree with Hans on this one...it\'s good to have some sort of frontier
region, unless you want to run the entire game with conmen and terrorists and
the like as the bad guys.  Not that it couldn\'t be done...

This idea isn\'t too bad in theory, but I have two objections.  The first is 
that it is my understanding that crew salaries and so forth are part of the
reason why military vessels in TCS take 10% of the initial cost per year to
maintain, when the annual maintenance rules for frieghters have always been
that the actual maintenance cost is 0.1% per year. The second is that the
adjustment isn\'t big enough.  A quick look through my TL15 Glisten Navy
designs shows that Crew Size * MCr1 is around 1-3% of the purchase price on
all major warships.  Thus, this rule would only trim down the fleet size by
1-3%, which isn\'t enough to do any good.

Maybe we should approach this problem backwards:  How many ships do we think a
fleet should have, and what kind of taxation rate does that give us?  How
many of the folks involved in this discussion have a copy of Fifth Frontier
War?  What do you think of the fleet levels there, in terms of effect on play
of the role-playing game?  Still too big?

We have to approach these things systematically, and this discussion is getting
too scattered for me to follow well right now.  Would someone like to post
another proposed solution, and the rationale for it?

(Hopefully incorporating the better parts of all the arguments...)

Maybe.  BUT, I\'m not arguing that this problem would necessarily exist in
the "real" Imperium.  What I am saying is that it does exist in the rules
of Striker, which we are using as a model for development of our picture of
future trends.

Let me put this another way.  In the real world, defense and counter succeed
each other in sort of a progressive escalation.  The earliest tanks had armor
which could shrug off rifle caliber machine gun bullets (hopefully) and the
infantry eventually countered with the anti-tank rifle.  As engines got better,
more armor was added to the tank, and the anti-tank rifle was neutralized.  
This situation prevailed at the beginning of WWII, and infantry was essentially
forced to depend on artillery in the form of limited numbers of anti-tank guns
for defense against tanks.  Then someone developed the shaped charge warhead
which again allowed some sort of man-carried attack which could threaten an
armored vehicle.  The situation remained stable (more or less) through the
70\'s, with man-portable shaped charge attacks gaining range with the intro-
duction of missiles.  Now, the development of reactive and composite armors
have changed the situation again, to the point where it is possible to design
a tank which can shrug off infantry attacks in most circumstances...I\'d suspect
that it isn\'t cost effective to do so because the weight/speed/cost tradeoffs
are not favorable.  Presumably the next step is either a man-portable kinetic
kill missile (heavy, lots of fuel needed) or an improved shaped charge method
which will counter the newer armor.

The trouble with Striker is this:  There are distinct limits to the development
of kinetic kill and shaped charge weapons.  We know what they are, and what
tech levels the maximums can be achieved in.  The tech level chart shows 
advances in armor outstripping the ability of kinetic kill and shpaed charge 
warheads to defeat it, roughly at TL14 with the introduction of superdense
armor.  Now, the overall battlefield situation is not brought to the level of
the 14th century, where armored men had a hard time injuring each other on the
battlefield because power generation technology and energy weapon technology
keeps up with  armor technology, and it is impossible to design a tank so well
armored that some sort of weapon can\'t punch through it.  The trouble is, from
the point of view of the infantry, that that weapon is likely to weigh 3/4 of
a ton and require another 5-6 tons of power plant to support it.  That makes
it non-portable, even for battledress equipped infantry, except of course by
their carriers, which are effectively tanks.

Anyway, beyond TL13 or so, I would guess that the optimum armor thickness for
tanks is going to be about 60...enough to shrug off infantry and low tech
weapons, but not so much that you can\'t load enough power plant into it to
push the limits of air speed, since speed will be the next most useful 
attribute, even if you don\'t allow Striker\'s evasion rule.

Would you care to suggest a class of infantry weapons that is not currently
covered by the rules that will threaten a grav tank?

Not necessarily.  He who fights and runs away, lives to run away another
day.
Look at the 18th century.  Very few private yachts (which is what a 200
ton free trader is in a universe of 60000 ton cruisers) could defeat a
pirate ship in a fight.  The Navy (then British) protected what they
could, but...
You could make the PCs commanding officers of a Tigris, and play like
Star Trek (five year mission, and all that.)

A third way:  increase the size of each ship.  Under standard rules, a
5000 ton free trader would require a crew of four.  If all ships were
built to the limit of their controls, each ship would be much bigger,
and there would be both fewer ships, and less disparity between small
ships and large ones.

TCS ignores crew salaries by making maintenance costs 100 times as high
as standard MT.  The extra 99x represents the costs of crews, bases,

Not totally unreasonable.  Not in accord with MT definition of Inertial
compensators, either...  Even so, it is a trivial addition to the cost
of a ship.  For example, a 100,000 ton TL15 cruiser (snatched at random
from "shattered ships..") would cost an extra MCr337.5 (to as much as
MCr 1687.5 for a six-G ship) out of a total cost of MCr397,217.  An
increase of 0.085% to total cost.  Who cares?

Especially since combat range will not exceed Far Orbit, much less
Extreme Orbit.

Unlikely in the extreme.  The normal evasive maneuvering should keep the
ship\'s PE threshold far enough from the launching ship\'s to cook any
teleporter who tried to do something like that.

Nonetheless, this is MT\'s picture.  Try FFW (Fifth Frontier War)
sometime.  Imperial ships DON\'T fight that far from their bases.
Besides, improvements such as you suggest would make those annoying
Naval vessels only about half as numerous, and twice as ubiquitous.  If
they could cruise that far from their bases, they.d be EVERYWHERE!

Agreed.  But how to implement?  Notice the rules in Starship Operator\'s
Manual on Annual Maintenance.  Carry the spare parts, and the job is
simple with the crew doing it\'s own maintenance continuously.

Sure.  Install a second jump drive, maneuver drive, sensor platform,
computer, etc.  Why be arbitrary about the price?  You want redundancy,
buy it from the standard rules.  See Leviathan for details.

That would still leave 100,000 + naval vessels out there cluttering up
the Imperium, and getting in everyone else\'s way.
 
My own notions for cutting number of ships:  
{ note that these assume that there are a certain high number of "doves"
in the Imperial senate.}
 
1) Warships will all be large, general purpose ships (like the
Enterprise).
 
2) High pop worlds will all be unconquerable, and even unassailable by
ANY number of warships.  The planetary defences are mind-boggling in
their size and variety.
 
3) The Imperial Navy will exist more as a police force (the Patrol?)
than a military venture.
 
So cut the Naval budget down to trivial levels, since the High Pop
worlds don\'t need them anyway, and won\'t pay for one to protect their
neighbors.
 
Problems:  The Imperium would cease to exist, probably.  The High Pop
worlds have no use for it, so 97+% of the Imperial population would tell
it to bug off and leave them alone.  Maybe the small worlds would get
together in local defense polities, but these would break up as soon as
the leading members reached that point of invulnerability that the High
Pop worlds have.
 
If High Pop worlds are "invulnerable", then someone, somewhere, is going
to build a fleet big enough to prove that contention wrong.  Then the
original problem reappears , but worse than before.  (check out the
"Lensman" series by E.E. Smith)
 
Advantages:   No-one needs the Imperium cluttering things up anyway. 
Let the High Pop worlds play with themselves, and keep the PCs out in
the frontiers where they belong.
You can always keep any NPC from upsetting the applecart.  Keep your PCs
away from more than a billion credits or so, and THEY sure can\'t build a
"doomsday fleet", so the second problem can be ignored.

    'body' => 'Hans made a few comments on Naval construction.

Well, I\'ll try to give a few reactions.

1) Inertial compensators:
My reading of inertial comps, is that the compensators in place can handle at
LEAST 6G\'s of acceleration just fine.  In my opinion, the big fast military
ships cost too much already (at least they do as compared to High Guard).
Having to install 6 times as much Inertial Compensators would just add to the
cost of the whole thing.

To justify this, I would say that the reason a Merchant ship would want the
ability to handle accelerations higher than their maneuver drive is for
collisions.  There was a bit in MegaTJournal #2, where they talk about a ship
that hit (essentually) an airborne whale.  The crew died because their
inertial comps were out.  This suggests that they would have survived had they
been functional.  Well, I\'ll tell you an impact like that is gonna produce
an acceleration of a LOT more than 6 Gs.  To my mind this indicates the comps
can handle a lot MORE than 6G Gs when working properly.  When you\'re loaded up
with breakable cargo, or passengers, or cargo that you don\'t wanna shift
around a lot.  The extra bit of compensation is justifiable.

2) Psi shielding for ships:
Well, why not?  It would be of very dubious use in preventing Zho Teleport
commandos though.  Remember, they have limited range.  Also there is the
problem that the attacker would still have to match vectors with the defender
to avoid the teleporters from slamming into the bulkheads of the ship they
are teleporting on to.

Such a maneuver would be VERY difficult.  You would have to be EXTREMELY
accurate in your determination of where the target is.  (sensor & piloting
tasks rated at Worse than impossible)  (Not to mention the fact that
presumably you are also getting shot at!)

But I would assume it would be effective against attacks by telepathy,
clairvoyance, and telekinesis.

It has dubious value for capital ships, but intruder type ships attempting
to penetrate the Naval Base at Chronor might find it useful.

3) Durability:
Hard to say.  I would oppose increasing the time required between maintanance
for ships.  If anything, once a year is a LONG time to leave something alone,
especially when you depend upon it for your LIFE!  Aircraft are overhauled
every 100 hours.  I have assumed that ships undergo maintainance constantly.
Spreading the cost out over an entire year.  Then, at the end of a year, the
inspection comes.  At that time, all systems MUST perform at specifications or
the ship\'s flight worthiness certificate will be revoked.

Maybe Steve Higginbotham can give us a clue as to how long Boomers go bettween
overhauls?

But if the availability of ports suitable for overhauls bothers you for Naval
vessels, I would suggest you take a look at the X-Boat tender.  I would say
that a properly manned X-Boat Tender could service up to say a 400 ton ship.
This would cover your basic X-Boats, Scouts, Gazelles, Fireys, and Patrol
Cruisers.

For larger Naval vessels, build a larger tender.  I\'d guess a battle rider
carrier could manage it for her brood.

I\'ve always assumed that naval ships had an average lifetime of 10 years
(or rather some combination of yearly repairs+maintenance and average
lifetime that comes to 10% per year, for example average 5%/year on
repairs/maintenance and average 20 years lifetime). I\'d overlooked that
once you\'ve established the initial fleet, you both pay 10% maintenance
per year _and_ explicitly for repair and replacements. Frankly, since what
I\'m concerned about is the initial investment I suggest that we keep the
"10 times yearly budget" rule for initial investments and drop the "10%
per year on maintenance" rule. In a real campaign the money spent on
repairs and replacements will use up your budget fast enough anyway :-)

It\'s not enough in itself, but every bit helps. Furthermore, I\'d suggest
that naval vessels routinely incorporates extra crew positions (as "spares",
you can\'t just hire a replacement if you loose one during a battle).

No need to choose one or the other. I favour using both. It\'s just that I

Well, fortunately we don\'t have to agree with each other on this. You will
agree, won\'t you,  that a psionic shield will be what a naval captain
longs for, even if it "only" protects him from having his thoughts read?

Teleporters, you mean. Teleporters teleport themselves, teleportees gets
teleported by others. You\'re right, an routine avoidance of matching
vectors with enemy ships will protect against teleport attacks. I\'d still
like an anti-teleport shield for when my ship is in port though ;-)
 (And then there\'s the threat of special psionics. A projecting teleporter
could destroy a hostile ship by teleporting a lump of iron from a ship with
a radically _different_ vector. Ouch!)

This is a very good idea. I\'d suggest tying the waste percentage to the size
of the interstellar community in question (so the Imperium wastes more than
the Darrian Confederation which wastes more than a single planet).

Well and good, but could one justify allowing a small hull to mount hardpoints
at the present cost and then increase the per hardpoint cost as the hull size
increases? I don\'t want to increase the price of the kind of ships that player
characters usually gets.

Two more good ideas. Do you think you could work a bit on them?

Well, as you an see by my mailing address (.army.mil) I derive my livelihood

Yes, and it can be worse in Traveller, since I can arrange things so that
the M-1 equivalent is armored all-around, instead of mostly in the front.

They do, actually...it\'s just not necessarily going to be an infantry weapon.

Actually, I seem to recall (without my rules handy today) that the extra 
carrying capacity of a suit of battledress is about 200kg--which is why I 
picked 3/4 of a ton--it\'s over the limit.

I don\'t like the pinpoint hit rule for a couple of reasons, having to do with
change overs from Striker.  The first is the log armor scale.  In Striker,
and in MT, there is a non-log region of the armor table (below 10?).  Above
that, a difference of 8 in the armor factor is twice or half the protection,
as the case may be.  Thus, the old Striker damage system seemed to be fairly
reasonable--a difference of +8 (twice the energy to penetrate) was almost a
sure kill.  In MT, the table is the same, but now we have the multiplicative
factor (*2 *1/2) to determine high/low penetration.  This leads to some severe
distortion at the upper end of the scale--if my armor is 40, 80 is needed to
get a high penetration.  80 is 2^5 (=32) times thicker than 40.  10 armor only
requires 20 (approximately double the thickness) to achieve a high penetration.

If I ever run a military campaign with MT, I\'ll probably make the high/low 
penetration a subtractive difference of 8 rather than a multiplicative 
difference of 2--the MT system seems to be trying to factor things in twice
and it doesn\'t work.

The second reason I don\'t like pinpoint hits is back to targetting ability in
general--I think that if systems are good enough to allow you to pick a
specific location on a tank that is less than 10% of the visible surface area
when that tank is a crossing target travelling at Mach 4 200kms away, then we
shouldn\'t even bother with a \'to hit\' roll for a non-pinpoint shot.  Esthetics
of the game mechanics don\'t jive.

Hmmmm...do the dampers roll as against indirect fire rounds (I think so)?
A TL15 PD system will roll 14-16 dice against indirect fire roounds, meaning
that the damper could reasonable expect to wipe out 50 or so nuclear missiles
before being overwhelmed.  Gets expensive...

Collapsing rounds require damper boxes, which are not man-portable, which still
leaves us with "rifle infantry and a few anti-tank guns".  I sometimes think
that a better analogy for TL15 infantry would be current infantrymen pitted
strictly against F-15Es.  Sure, you can carry Stingers, but...

How so?  It looks about the same to me...at least if you consider High Guard

Although it has since been picked up by Chuck Gannon (and hence Challenge and
Hard Times), I\'m the one who came up with the IDP name.  I figured that they
were essentially given away free by the Imperium in the interest of maintaining
a healthy economy to tax...

Hmmmm....I don\'t know about that for sure, Steve.  While I didn\'t go into it
extensively at the time, some back of the envelope calculations had me 
convinced that bulk freight transport by grav vehicle probably becomes 
economical with the increased fusion plant output at TL13.  Below that level, 
you would see increasing amounts of people and high value/low weight cargoes
moving by grav vehicle from TL9 through TL12.  Bulk cargo, though, would be
easier/cheaper to move in wheeled vehicles on roads between population and
distribution centers.  Think of it as a railroad analogy.  There will also be
other special purpose applications for wheeled and tracked vehicles even at
higher TLs, so the technology won\'t be completely forgotten.

A better way is to consider the price of missiles.  At Cr50000 each, a bay
shoots off MCr1.25 with each volley.  As to supertankers and guns, I must
point out that missile racks and lasers are recoilless weapons, and would
not require structural reinforcement.

The _only_ time you would need extra inertial compensation (above the drive
rating, or at least above the emergency drive rating) is for an impact or other
sudden acceleration.  Personally, I don\'t believe it will work in such a case.
It\'s been a long time since I was in basic physics, but I work with artillery
projectiles now...a sudden deceleration from aircraft or spacecraft speeds 
could be almost as bad as the acceleration experienced in a gun tube by the
shell, which is measured in 1000s of Gs.  I think a crash is a crash, and
DGP hadn\'t thought through the business of inertial compensators when they put
them in MT.  In fact, I gather from what I\'ve read in MTJ, TD and on GEnie that
they don\'t think that they necessarily have anything to do with grav technology
at all.  Naturally, I don\'t like that viewpoint, and treat them as grav plates
mounted along the line of thrust.

Actually, the primary requirement for an effective PIRATE is crew space,
and station-keeping ability.  Not weaponry, acceleration, or much of
anything else.  In High Guard, power plant fuel use was low enough that you
had plenty of room for extra men (though the bunk helped in that regard),
and it was relatively easy to design a ship that could stay on station for
several months.

UNlikely.  Have you checked out the price of a mile of highway?  How about
a million miles of it?
BTW, RAILROADS (at least the maglev kind) I can believe in.  I don\'t really
expect them, but I could accept them.  For hauling large cargoes about on a
world, expect to see large, low performance spacecraft.  They can deliver
the goods so quickly that the required fleet would be quite small, and if
they used enough grav to get 1.25 times local surface G, most would be less
than 1G (about 0.75 actually).  They can still make a sub-orbital hop, and
still cost less than the million or so miles of roads they replace.
 
Especially if you use our additions to the pricing schemes for LPHG and
LPLG.
I am sure that you can build a wheeled vehicle for less than any grav
vehicle (if you try hard), but it is unlikely to cost less if you add the
cost of the highway system in.
 
BTW, at the present price of highways (a few million per mile), a world
could import grav cars for everyone, rather than build a highway system as
large as ours.  And ours is none too large, as rush hour traffic will
attest.

A boomer goes five to ten years between major overhauls.  The reactor is

to three years.  Maintenance happens 18+ hours of every day underway, and
perhaps 12-15 hours per day in port.

Some of the presupositions are as follows:
 
     Given the increased depandance on fast food places and pizza deliveries
by modern families from c. 1990 Terra, this dependance was extrapolated to
the times of the present Imperium.  At some point, this dependance reaches a
critical mass.   A conflicting issue is the lack of people in the labor pool
who would be willing to work for minimum wage to staff these fast food
emporiums.
 
     As fewer workers are available more and more of these fast food places
go out of business.  As a result there is less and less fast food available
for the growing demand.  This demand has at this point begun to double on a
daily basis.
 
     As a result, more time is spent waiting for the fast food to arrive
either at the customer\'s home or time spent waiting in line.
 
     This leads to a decline in services in other sectors as the work force
spends more time waiting for its fast food.  As a result critical services
become crippled.  Fires rage out of control, starships are not service and
goods are not delivered where needed.
 
     The end comes as a continual downward spiral until the entire Imperium
is rendered impotant.  And the long darkness begins....

Cynthia Higginbotham has announced her intent to begin a private PBEM
game. Mark (current ref x 0.5) and richard (original ref) have both
given her their blessings, along with a fair bit of what they consider
good advice. If I may, I (current ref x 0.5) would like to complete 
the triangle with some advice of my own.

Don\'t do it. Don\'t don\'t don\'t don\'t DON\'T.

I\'m sorry to be such a wet blanket, but I HAVE to inject a note of
reason into this round of mutual backslapping. Reffing a PBEM is 
incredibly hard work, incredibly time-consuming and incredibly
frustrating. Mark and I stepped in last month to take over for 
Richard, who was finally admitting defeat after staggering along
trying to hold things together for two long years. We did so because
the PBEM had become a labor of love for over forty people, past and 
present, and we just couldn\'t let it die. And we WON\'T let it die.

Even if it kills us. Which it\'s doing, quite handily.

On average, Mark and I spend two hours PER DAY sorting out PBEM mail
and archives, answering questions, straightening out problems, 
trying to prepare for contingencies that will arise in later turns,
plotting ahead where we can, etc. And this is BEFORE the game actually
begins! Once people start generating actual game turns, our load will
skyrocket. Both our tempers are fraying, and we have both wondered
out loud (a) how Richard ever did it (b) how we\'ll continue to manage
it.

The difference is that Richard had an extremely relaxed reffing style;
he set up a general situation, put some characters in it, and let it
go. Inertia has kept it moving for two years plus, which translates 
into about two weeks of game time. We\'ve been travelling to a newly
discovered ringworld-- and in two years of play, we HAVEN\'T EVEN TOUCHED
DOWN YET. The entire game, since 1989, has been about the trip there!

Some people are having a blast. Others are incredibly frustrated at having
nothing to do for Two Whole Years. Some people post twenty moves per day;
others post once a month or less. Somehow, all of these people must be
coordinated into a common time and causality flow, compounded by the twin
problems of restricted knowledge-base and poor gaming etiquette. By nature,
gamers are secretive; this means that the ref has to handle dozens of
simultaneous secret byplays that are often at cross purposes with one 
another-- A and B claim to be having a secret chat in one place, while 
a public turn is going on at the same time and place. Etiquette demands
that a player not use knowledge that HE has but his CHARACTER does not;
this has been violated already by at least a dozen people, with serious
repercussions. And so on, and so on....

Some people have argued that we should just relax and go with the flow,
as Richard has done in the past. These same people are also screaming
about plot and timeflow inconsistencies that they can\'t quite wrap
their heads around. When you add to the fact that the past two years
have been devoted to just getting to our destination, and the REAL plot
is just beginning, things are promising to become hellish.

I don\'t want to make anyone feel guilty-- I love this game, and I\'m 
having a blast getting it up and running again. I know Mark is, too.
Believe me, if I didn\'t love it, I wouldn\'t do it, no matter WHAT.
But I can NOT stand by and let someone who hasn\'t tried it walk 
blindly into it without issuing some kind of a feeble warning.

Cynthia, if you MUST do this, do yourself a favor: don\'t run double-blind,
in fact demand that all but the most desperately secret turns be public,
and that people run their characters maturely and not use information
they shouldn\'t have. Set strict timeflow limits, and don\'t be afraid 
to veto turns that are impossible or out of place. And above all, resist
the temptation to let everybody play-- in fact, if you run a group of
more than four or five players, you\'re going to run into serious hassles.
Set up an address server if you possibly can, with an autoarchive, like
we have (thanks to Dan Corrin, without whom we\'d be dead in the water),
and have default actions per turn for every player in case they don\'t
post often. 

And keep smiling, because the alternative is total insanity.

The first PBEM turn of 1992 will be published on the TML this coming
Monday, in several (three?) parts. As soon as the last part is published,
play resumes automatically. We\'ll see you at the Hoop....

Actually Antares left the Julian League around 1120 or so.  It might

I agree totally.

But when impact is at relatively low speeds, survival is possible.  If the
ship hits an object and is allowed say to decelerate over a period of one
second, then collisions of less than 300 kph are survivable.  If we allow
say the inertial compensators to put out an extreme burst, say compensating
for 25G\'s then you can allow up to 900kph collisions and survive.

Actually, decelerations are going to be over microseconds, thus Rob is correct
when he says collisions range in the 100s to 1000s of Gs.  But to my mind the
paltry few G\'s of compensation could amount to a \'Five mile an hour bumper\'.
For very small collisions it might save a few lives.  In a head on collision
you\'ll be dead no matter what you do.

I agree wholeheartedly with this.  In fact, the Striker Tables are
Logarithmic above 13.  I noticed this problem when we first acquired the
game, but it was not relevant in our play, since grav tanks never appear in
the course of play.  We haven\'t had a starship combat since 1990 (one of
our ships was shot up by the Zhos in the FFW).

Probably not.  However, under such extreme conditions, the to hit task
would be essentially impossible anyway, and the extra difficulty of a
pinpoint hit is irrelevant.  Note that a sizable (depending on task
difficulty) fraction of attempted pinpoint hits aren\'t any such thing.  You
SHOULD be able to TRY to pinpoint.  Whether you succeed is another question
entirely.

While Striker did not deal with the question, I doubt there is a good
reason that Damper Boxes cannot be smaller than the 3 ton  basic model.  A
man-portable version can weigh in at much as 150 Kg to get some useful
payload.  Surely between TL13 and TL15 they\'ve worked out the portable box
for the infantry.  Then you fire a collapsing round from an anti-tank
rifle.
May still not be good enough.  In which case, as you say, we are back to
mid-WW2 in terms of infantry use.
 
 
My own analysis of MT/Striker combat produced this:
 
  1)  No grav vehicles will be on the field against a high tech army. 
Densitometers can pick them out and meson guns can be targeted from
anywhere on the planet.  At TL13+, you use ACVs.
 
  2)  No fusion plants either.  Neutrino sensors and meson guns this time. 
Fuel cells, solar, MHD perhaps.  No fusion.  Never.
 
  3)  This mostly means that a stealthy ACV will be the primary transport. 
Yes, a stealthy ACV is a contradiction in terms, but it can only be
detected by things relatively close by, not by sensors on the far side of
the continent.
 
  4)  Therefore the superheavy armour never makes it onto the scene, except
possibly as tracklayers.  Lack of mobility relative to ACVs will relegate
them to fairly minor roles in any mobile campaign.
 
  5) In any case, combat between TL15 troops will be rare.  You won\'t
conquer a TL15 Hi Pop world with any force that the Imperium can move
through space.  Destroy the world maybe.  Conquer it unlikely.
Most combat will be at TL12-13, and will probably look a lot like the North
Africa campaign -> mobile troops running around madly, infantry sitting
still and just trying to survive, tanks avoiding the infantry whenever
possible, since the infantry have AT guns and Arty, and the tanks are much
safer to play with.

Topic 2b of Steve Higginbotham\'s possible explanations of the Second
Long Night intrigued me, partly because its similarity to Michael
McCollum\'s novel _Antares Dawn_.  In this novel, interstellar travel
utilized foldpoints produced by some hand-waving super-gravity.
The explosion of Antares changed the structure of the foldpoints for
over 100 ly around, and irradiated the worlds within twenty to forty
ly.
 
My question is, what would a comparable explosion do in Traveller?
I haven\'t seen the \'Darrians\' alien module in question, but I infer
that they have a device for inducing a supernova, whose first and only
test knocked their civilization back to the Stone Age.  Would this
radiation be stopped by nuclear dampers?  Could factions within the
Imperium develop dampers large enough to cover a world for the time
necessary to protect it from the first shockwave from a supernova?
Related to this would be the effect of such an explosion on local
jumpspace.  Since jumpspace exists now, I would find it difficult to
believe that one supernova could destroy jumpspace.  However, because
jumpspace is tied to gravity wells could the gravitic shock wave
disrupt jumps within a particular area, or across the leading wave,
or something similar?
 
A limited action using these devices, or even the chance supernova
of a large and aging star, would make for a most interesting (if far-
fetched) scenario.

  Purchase price? I didn\'t think the purchase price had to be payed at all,
just the 10% of purchase price cost which pays the purchase (but spread out
during several years) and maintainance. So you should compare the salary to
10% of the purchase price and not 100% of it. This would make the fleed shrink
by 10 to 30% for TL15 and more at lower TL\'s where larger crews are needed.

  Which will invalidate both the advantages of good tactics (catching the

tank in a location where the armor in thin, like roof, bottom or rear).

  Didn\'t you do a MT M1A1 equivalent? How much did it weigh and how much armour

  This would affect the PC\'s capability of popping off missiles like pop-corn
too so it has it\'s disadvantages.

  Why keep all missiles equal: Striker assumes that bay missiles are 25cm
diameter while turret missiles are just 15cm diameter. It would be easy to
increase the size of the missiles. A cubical 50ton bay should be 8.7 meters
in each axis, so bay missiles could easily be as big as modern-day torpedoes
(even the type 65 650mm:) and carry warheads of up to 500kg.

  I think all PD weapons has to see the rounds for at least 50cm (500m?) to
be able to counter them. This is stated explicitely for countering direct
fire rounds, but it should be true for all rounds. I think they didn\'t mention
this when talking about artillery PD because most artillery will easily
be seen for much more than 500m before impact.
 
  So the infantry could use recoilless rifles with nuclear rounds to take out
almost any target no matter how hard it is.

I agree! I brought up a similar point a few months ago. Why aren\'t 
there larger ships? To me it would be more economical when shipping

A fleet should have enough ships to patrol the volume of space which is
their responsibility.  The FFW game includes enough ships to do that if
we assume 5-15 ships per squadron.  It is still enough to make piracy an
awfully iffy proposition - too much chance of the Navy being aroud to
spoil the fun.
 
Personally, I like the idea of producing a treaty of perpetual
friendship with the Consulate, and starting a second Solomani Rim War. 
This will suck most of the ships to the far side of the Imperium, and
KEEP THEM THERE!  The Navy ceases to be a problem unless you are in the
Solomani Rim.  Of course, if your campaign is over there, reverse the
process:  peace there, war in the Marches, the ships leave anyway.

Nice goal...  Not very likely that your warships will be that small,
though.  In the Real World, battleships and Carriers are smaller than
supertankers, but are larger than everything else afloat.  If a
"supertanker" is a million tonner, then a battleship or carrier would be
about 200,000 tons.

That is not why military equipment costs so much.  It has more to do
with short production runs and high research costs.  Unfortunately, in
the Imperium, the research was all done 100-10000 years ago, and the
production runs are quite large (thousands of copies of each ship?).

Actually, we see few supertankers with 10 127mm naval guns because it is
against the law in most countries to put weapons like that on privately
owned ships.  Note that in WW2,we DID see merchants mounting heavy guns.

I doubt it.  If we do that, the ships will just look more like my
Sikkintar (one BIG gun).  the price change won\'t affect anything except
Naval design doctrine.

Again, unlikely.  If you do that, then civilian ships will armor
themselves to be "pirate-proof", and pirates will arm themselves with
bay weapons.  In any case it will have little effect on Naval vessels. 
If bays cost too much, they\'ll use a cheaper alternative, or just raise
taxes to pay the difference.
Remember, the Military is in the business of wasting money.

This is not what I find when designing weapons systems for future wars. To
be sure, there are fundamental limits on how powerful man-portable weapons
dependent on chemical explosives can be. But then, there are also fundamental
limits on how tough armor made of theoretically possible materials can be.
So you have the same situation as has prevailed since WWI: a continual arms
race between tank armor and infantry anti-tank weapons, with neither able
to gain a permanent edge.

However, while armor not made of atomic matter is theoretically impossible,
weapons not dependent on chemical explosives are not. Once you get to the
stage where a fusion gun can be made man-portable (the Traveller "FGMP-16"
is based on this idea, though the effect is greatly understated), then as
far as I can see, armored vehicles become redundant because a fusion gun
is basically a straight-line hydrogen bomb; you could blow away an Iowa-
class battleship with one like a china plate in a shooting gallery, never
mind a tank.

Of course, before you get man-portable fusion guns, you will have them
carried on tanks, though tanks would probably still retain armor for
protection against artillery and infantry weapons.

The only way I can see out of this (unless and until you allow force-fields
to be developed, but these are *seriously* high technology if possible at all)
is to assume that there is a rule (written or unwritten) against using nuclear
weapons, including fusion guns, on an inhabited planet.

Now you said something about "superdense armor" in the Striker rules, which
I assume is some sort of theoretically *impossible* armor, which can
withstand any man-portable conventional weapon; but if this is what is
causing your problem, why not simply remove it and improve the realism while
you\'re at it?

Probably not.  Will 30 men in battledress be a match for such a weapon? 
That equates cost of the two systems to deploy.  Probably still not.  30
infantry with normal weapons today are not a match for an F15E either,
but they still are needed on the battlefield.

I can agree with this without reservation.  That is his primary purpose
today, and at all times since WW1.
 
Keep in mind the primary advantage of infantry as opposed to armour: 
Infantry has a much more finely developed sense of self-preservation. 
They hide a lot better, too.  Infantry are pretty hard to root out if
they don\'t want to be, as Iwo Jima and other battlefields (Vietnam comes
to mind) have shown.

Lovely idea.  Fire control would be somewhat of a bear, though.  Still,
all in all, as a TL16 infantry weapon, it has a lot of promise.

PD weapons must see the rounds for at least 150m (15cm).

More likely a nuke-tipped tac-missile, but you have the general idea.
 
BTW, Rob, when you determined the pen59 maximum, did that include IR
follow-up missile, which increase penetration by 8?  And presumably the
SECOND IR follow-up, which does 8 more.  And the third, and the fourth,
and...
 
And don\'t forget to extend the HEAP penetration table down 7 more places
for those TL13+ 36cm HEAP rounds.  Penetration should jump to 66, then.
 
And if you design the ultimate armoured vehicle using MT (instead of
Striker), keep in mind that MT armour has NO VOLUME.  It distorts
reality slightly, to say the least.

Well, my understanding of the Vilani mindset, is that they want to USE the
technology, but avoid understanding it like the plague.  Thus their engineers
use advanced diagnostic computer programs to keep their drives going.

Well, in flight training, you quickly learn that you GOTTA understand the
machinery that is keeping you in the air, and keeping you ALIVE.  If some
Vilani pilot considers it beneath him to know what a fuel shut off valve does,
or that he should keep an eye on the tachometer, or that he should understand
wether or not the alternator is working, he\'d BETTER have some computer doing
it for him.

I find in the cockpit, you spend roughly equal amounts of time monitoring the
instruments as you do watching out for traffic.  If Mr. Vilani doesn\'t feel
like watching the gauges, he will be dead, Dead, DEAD.  Thus auto-pilots to

There is a diagram of an X-15 flight profile in the proceedings of the
"30th anniversary of the first X-15 flight" conference that was held at the
NASA Dryden center a few years ago, which showed that the X-15 climbed above
99% of the atmosphere.  I suppose that qualifies for re-entry, although it
did not have orbital speed, and the heat would therefore have been less.

I agree with Scott, though, it really shouldn\'t matter to the players since
I would not expect them to own one.  Operate one, yes, but not own one.

Make that East Germany, and then guess why the Berlin Wall went up.  In
1989, the people of East Germany finally figured out, in large numbers,
how to get out without crossing the Wall.  I\'d say that it was more than
"VERY few people" that did indeed pull up their roots and head for the
West for the chance of better times.

There\'s something wrong with the economy then. If it cost your entire

You\'re looking at it the wrong way round. By making that ship
MCrimp 1687.5 more expensive I\'ve just cost the navy 10 patrol
cruisers  -  20 if we also use my extra durability rule. Still,
you\'re right that\'s it\'s not enough in itself. Which is why I
asked for help. Bertil\'s already come up with some good stuff.
But as for trivial, every little bit helps :-)

Except when GDW conviniently forgets that and lets Terran Confederation
fleets penetrate to Vland and Aslan ihatei attack Aki. Naval ships don\'t
_like_ to fight far from a base  -  who would  -  but it\'s not unreasonable
to suppose that the various admiralties would plan for it.

Not true. Ordinary patrols don\'t go on 5 year patrols under the present
system, true. But they don\'t go on 1 year patrols either. They move about
in a 2-3 month circuit ending up where they started out. So at the moment
they\'re only out of the running 2 weeks in every 52. The same would apply
if they had a potential 5 year cruising range. But there would only be
half as many.

Well, for one thing my rule is wonderfully simple. Just add umpteen
percent to the price. And easy to implement: Just extend the time
allowed between overhauls by one year per 25% extra paid and
make the overhaul last two weeks per year since the last one.

Right, so we need something more. Why does everybody seem to assume that

That\'s a valid point. But you know, I could much easier use a ship with
slightly incompatible design than a universe that has a serious logical
flaw in it. And I can ignore ship design discrepancies much easier than
discrepancies in the background universe. I could cure the problem with
too many ships easily by making up my own frontier area from the Imperium
where there are no high-pop planets within 30 parsecs. But I\'d rather stay
in The Spinward Marches. So what if my ships all use 6 times as many inertial
compensators as the ones I copy from you? If that really bothers me I\'ll
just let your ships come from a planet that made really efficient ships. One
planet isn\'t going to be much of a problem, there\'s a limit to how many
ships one planet can build ("Sorry, no, our spaceyards are booked up solid
for the next three decades").

Touche. Let me retract the bit about every little bit helping ;-)
I admit that some expenses are too trivial to bother with.
Nevertheless, A couple of percent here and a couple of percent
there is not really all that trivial when we\'re talking multi-

They sure are.  That\'s why Cynthia and I have been re-writing the rules
to lower ship prices.  However, it doesn\'t really matter how much the
ship costs, if it will pay for itself.  BUsinesses do not tie up capital
in new purchases.  They BORROW the entire amount, with the new purchase
as collateral.  So your PCs have to borrow MCr3000, instead of MCr30. 
If the ship makes a profit, it will be no problem.
 
Seriously, I doubt that you should design piracy around the assumption
that the average pirate is as small as a PC\'s ship.  The average pirate
should be 10-50 times as big as a PC\'s ship.  If it were smaller, it
couldn\'t survive when the Navy came after it (It probably won\'t anyway,
but that is another problem...).  A pirate ship should be converted from
a bulk hauler (Hercules class (5000t), World class (3000t), Leviathon
class (1800t)).  That way you get enough ship to do the job.  Face it,
the pirate probably has to steal the ship anyway.  So he\'ll steal a good
one.

Reread TCS.  That is the assumption about the MAXIMUM Navy size.  If you
need newer ships, decommission some of the old ones.  Or maintain your
Navy at less than full size.  Note also that the Budget multiplier goes
UP in wartime.  So you can afford to buy some new stuff then.
In the Real World, the size of the military establishment is at the
maximum that the budget allows.  When the budget goes up, buy new ships,
raise new regiments.  When it drops, mothball ships and retire
regiments.

Actually, we\'ll knock back 10 either way.  Presumably the patrol
cruisers will be built that way too.
As to the "every little bit helps" assertion, that\'s true.  But since
you can buy 2400+ patrol cruisers for every Heavy cruiser, the Navy can
still have as many as before.  They\'ll build fewer major warships, but
little stuff is easier to sneak onto the budget, so the little stuff
will be unaffected.

GDW has always had consistency problems.  I doubt that they would bother
to.  Notice that before WW2, NOBODY did any serious planning about
operations far from bases.  That\'s why the major powers had Treaty Bases
scattered all over the world.  That\'s also why Hitler lost the Battle of
Britain - his planes were designed to operate within a hundred miles of
their fields, and suffered when they had to go as far as England.

Not true.  Some Batrons and Crurons hit their bases about once a year. 
Specifically those operating in the Trojan Reaches and Five Sisters and
Jewell.  Imperial Navy ships in the Marches and Reaches only have FOUR
worlds that can maintain them (Mora, Trin, Glisten, Rhylanor).  And none
are especially close to those operating areas.  Sure, they stop at some
Navy base every few months, but they don\'t stop where they need to get
maintenance that often.  If they did, the Impy Navy would NEVER GET TO

Do you want your PCs doing this too?  Never allow an element into a game
unless you prepared to let your PCs acquire (read:steal) it.
 
BTW, It doesn\'t bother me at all.  I like exploration adventures anyway,
and your system would make the mission (presently being planned) beyond
the Consulate MUCH easier.  The PCs doing the mission have plenty of
money.  That\'s as good a way as any to spend some of it.

I don\'t.  But the more complex the solution, the less likely it is to be
implemented.  KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) applies.  If you waste time
looking at partial solutions that raise the price a percent or two,
you\'ll start to look like the Gentlemen (I use the word with
reservations) in Congress (USA, of course).  They tackle the budget
deficit every year.  They trim back $50million here and there, and are
proud of themselves.  Of course, the deficit is measured in tens (or
hundreds) of BILLIONS, but they\'ve saved us $50,000,000 and should be
patted on the back for DEALING WITH THAT OLD BUDGET PROBLEM.
 
Look for REALLY MAJOR ways of cutting things back!  If it doesn\'t cut
out 75% of the Navy, then you are not thinking big enough.  Cut Taxes!
Have the Navy waste A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY doing research into
disintegrators/proton beams/antimatter systems.  Use research programs
as holes to throw money into.  Start a program to refurbish all
howevermany Depots up to TL16 standards, with yard facilities equivalent
to Trin\'s.  Look at the problem as if you were a Congressman form
Nevada, and you wanted as much as possible of the Naval budget spent in
your district.  D@#! the Navy.  My constituents need jobs!

  It outnumbers it three to one in turrets if it uses all available hardpoints.
This will cost MCr675 if we assume 300 triple missile turrets, but probably
less since a part of them will be sandcasters. A 10kt SIE Behemoth costs
MCr1537, so the 30kt should cost at least MCr4611. The armaments will
thus represent a cost increase of 15% not counting computers. Parity with
the corsair (100 turrets) will be achieved at a cost increase of 5%.

  10)STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY: Building an 1MT starship that has to stand
up to 6G of acceleration and weapon impacts demands very strong materials.
I suspect that such materials don\'t exist today. There is a certain maximum
size for each combination of material strength and structural stress,
and this will set the maximum size for all ships. Any larger than that they
will (in extreme cases) tear themselves apart when going at full throttle
or crack as an egg shell when hit in combat.
  Civilian ships don\'t have to handle the same levels of stress as 
military ships, so they have a larger maximum size (and cost less for an
equal tonnage). You could say that this is already present in the armour 
rules today, but armour is voluntary while this would be a compulsory
factor.

  An example: A 10kt hull at TL15 will have to weigh X metric tons and have
Y kubic meters (kilolitres for you MT-damaged:) of interior space wasted
on structural components if it is going to be able to pull 6 Gees and stand
on it\'s own in combat. More than this and it becomes more durable and less
than this and it becomes more frail(1).
  The same size and TL of hull but rated for 1G civilian duty only would
perhaps only weigh 1/4 of the other hull and have a tenth of the interior
space taken up by structural components.


 (1) This ties in closely to the use of hull-points and armour. I\'d like to
suggest that the number of hullpoints be based the size of the hull and
modified for the ships \'fragility factor\': A 10kt hull has 10000 points as
a base. If it is the 1G trader it will only have 2500 points while a 
6G combat-rated cruiser would have 15000 hull point (or even larger 
difference). These practical hullpoints can be increased with interior
strenghtening to copy the strengthening effect of increased armour in 
TDR VEH. Armour will thus mean the actual hull plating, and not hull plating
plus interial strengthening.
  There should also be a minimum level of hull points for each level of G
the ship can pull and a mimimum level for jump dependent on the tonnage and so
on. If the ship violates those it will begin to suffer catastrophic effects. 
The effects of weapons depends on the damamge of the weapon compared to the 
hull points remaining.
  Hull tonnage relates to basic hull points non-linearly (somebody suggested
this some time ago: I remember a square root being involved somewhere but 
those messages is lost now) to discourage humongous battleships being able
to absorbe ludicrous amounts of damage without visible effect.

  When working in a place where all chips we used could stand severe 
temperature changes :) I came upon a little analogue chip called the 4741 
which contained 4 741 operational amplifyers. If you buy the civilian 
version I\'d expect it to cost less than 10 cents, but the little 4741 in
a cheramic capsule and all costs around $8.

  The big question is: Is there a difference in MTBF (Mean Time Between
Failures) between military and civilian starships?

  Yes, but never as many guns and of as big calibre as a warship of equal
tonnage. There is today a Russian fleet replenishment ship that is armed 
with a small number (3 I think) of naval medium calibre guns, but going
from it\'s tonnage we\'d expect it to be much more heavily armed: Two SAM
systems, one SSM system, ASW mortars, torpedo tubes, CIWS and so on.

  It will encourage naval ships to mount bays instead of turrets, since
each turret battery consists of many turrets (many FC\'s) while a bay is
one large turret (one FC). It would also encourage civilian ships 
(who can\'t afford the expensive bays) to keep the number of turrets down.

  Not if armour (and combat-proof hull) is so expensive that their profits
disappear.

  Not if that cheaper alternative is ineffective against their likely
opponents. I find it highly doubtful that the Imperium, the Consulate and
the Confederation could agree to that no ship can be armored and just cheap
weapons can be used:)
  It is quite likely that they reduce the number of ships to make each ship
more efficient.

> or just raise

  But you can use that argument against *all* capers to increase the cost
of naval ships! If we don\'t agree that more expensive military vessels will
lead to smaller fleets, what are we discussing? :)

  BTW: see my other mgs on How the Imperium Fell: Now the Truth can be told:)

  I\'m almost willing to wager that certain ATGM\'s or other man portable 
weapons (FFV\'s HEAP Tank-mine for example) can penetrate it if they hit it 
from the side, the rear, the top or the bottom. It it had 200mm armor plate

groundpressure.

  It is bad from the point of view of the game: Tactics is not encouraged,
just a slugfest. The half-armour vs pinpoint is a hack as you can pinpoint
all you like if it as 500mm all around, it will still have 500mm all around.

> Tactics and design theories change as

  This isn\'t an artifact of technology, it is a result of the design system.
If it was possible to vary the thickness of the armour independently for
all faces of the vehicle, almost all designers would optimize the armour
to be thicker than with MegaT on the sides that face the primary danger and
thinner on the other sides: Saving weight, gaining G\'s and Mw for the
weapon, and reducing cost.

  At 150m I hope they have their lead underwear on. BTW: When I get home

[Oops, it got longer than I thought when I started it!]

	  How the Imperium Fell: Now the Truth can be told

  1116, A cold planet in the Swordworlds: Emperor Strephon and The Chairman of
the High Council for the Zhodani Consulate meet in the utmost secrecy at the
request of the Emperor. In 1114 the Consulate had sent a secret delegation to
Capitol/Core to inform the Emperor of the result of a several hundred years
long project of theirs.
  To make a long story short, the Consulate had long ago found an Ancient
artifact in the ruins on Zhdants moon(1). The artifact was a device that
enhanced and focused the innate psionic power of teleporters so that one
person marginally skilled in teleportation could teleport himself with
full equipment and up to five (depending on strength) non-psionic individuals
or warbots over interplanetary distances. Furthermore the device automatically
compensated for differences in vector and potential energy.
  Now the Zhodanis, in a manner similar to when the Imperium copied the
first black globe, had managed to start producing copies of the device.

  The Zhodani delegation to Core informed the Imperium of this up to then
highly secret development and assured that it would be used in the case of
an Imperial attack upon the Consulate or with the consulate allied states.
Their claims were proven in a demonstration where a volunteer Zhodani and
five warbot dummies teleported from a Zho cruiser to a Imperial cruiser
over Jewell while both ships were engaged in heavy maneuvering on 
interplanetary range from eachother.

  The Imperial High Command was terrified. The fact that the Imperial 
defence budget consumed 50% of the Imperial GNP had been hidden by creative
accounting by the IISS and the Department of Finance intentionally giving
too high figures for planetary GNP and the Navy and the Megacorps officially
claiming that the military ships were incredbly cheaper than in reality.
  Originally just a few percent went to military ends, but the several hundred
years long arms-race with the Zhodanis had led to a gradual increase. 
As to not alert the Zhodanis and other enemies that the Imperiums economy 
too weak to sustain this level of spending a policy of forging GNP and Ship
costs begun and while the Zhodani soon penetrated it it still fooled the 
Solomani and other enemies.
  
  Emperor Strephon immediately ordered that a countermeasure be found and
installed on all Imperial warships. A countermeasure already existed: 
Additional psionic shielding installed in all ship, but it was horribly
expensive. The already existant shielding in the ships was one of the
secret posts in the Navy budget that sucked up immense amounts of money
for repairs and maintainance of the frail and experimental electronics.

  Now the economists revealed to Strephon that the Imperial economy simply
couldn\'t handle the strain of equipping all, or even the most important
ships with this new and even more expensive and difficult-to-maintain 
anti-teleport psionic shielding. It would collapse totally.

  Forced into a corner by the "The Zho\'s *will* attack us, it is just a
matter of time, and any peace-treaty on their part is a scam, so we *must*
have this new shield" faction in the high Imperial Nobility and Military 
led by Dulinor of Illelish and the economic realities Strephon had no choise
but to start playing his trump cards.

  The first card played was the Darrian Option: A sizeable fraction of the 
Corridor fleet got a transfer order to the Solomani Rim while the similar 
number of ships in the Rim got a transfer order to Corridor. This was 
officially called a \'unit exchange manuever\'. In reality it travelled towards
the Darrians but stopped in deep space outside the border. A fleet courier
continued on and delivered a message from Emperor Strephon to the Darrians.

  The message was that unless the Darrians attacked a long list of Zhodani
systems with their \'Maghiz device\' a.k.a the Star Trigger, elements of the
Imperial Corridor Fleet would sterilize all Darrian worlds with nuclear, 
chemical and biological weapons. The Darrian response was that unless certain 
coded and outwardly normal messages continued to be transmitted over the 
Imperial Xboat Network from Darrian to certain places in the Imperium,
preplaced Maghiz devices would be triggered on several places in the 
*Imperium*.

  The fleet left.

  The second card was the Ultraviolet Option, an extension of the old Project
Blackheart. Several imperial deep penetration fleet intruders equipped with
non-standard propulsions: Jumpdrives who\'s sinks could be charged by enormous
deployable solar arrays thus removing the need for travelleing close to
planets would enter the Consulate using their solar-arrays to complement
wilderness refuellings on cometary nucleii in interstellar space and in
surprise attacks bombard the major Zhodani HiPop worlds with nuclear,
biological and chemical weapons.

  Just a few weeks after the five ships had departed a new delegation from
the Consulate arrived at Regina bringing proof that all five ships had been
intercepted and destroyed before even leaving the Spinward Marches sector.

  Their message was that "We expected as much from you untrustworthy Imperials,
but we will overlook it. But try something more and we will crush you."
Strephon had secretly been on Regina to direct first the Darrian option and
then the Ultraviolet option without the time delays, and he now requested
an immediate summit. The location agreed on was the Sworldworlds. Zhodani-
allies but almost in the Imperial sphere of influence.

  Emperor Strephon travelled there to try to cut a deal not too unfavourable
to the Imperium, but at least one person in his entourage viewed this as an
capitulation and spilled the beans. Word about what was happening spread
with a 2Jump6 fleet courier across the Rift to Illelish where Dulinor put 
the plan he had prepared on the off chance that Strephon "chickened out" as
he put it.

  So while Emperor Strephon signed an agreement in which the Imperium 
permanently gave up all claims for any area spinward of the current positions
in the Marches and coreward of Deneb and spinward of the Windhorn rift, 
reduced the size of the fleet with 75% and declared the Spinward Marches as
a demilitarized zone, Archduke Dulinor travelled towards Core to perform
a coup.

  Strephon got wind of the assassination when his ship was attacked in
Corridor and set off for his retreat position to rally his forces. Meanwhile
Dulinors coup had run into trouble. His co-conspirator Lucan who had 
promised to help back Dulinor by preparing incriminating evidence of
Strephons \'treason\' in exchange for the position of Archduke of Deneb had
all the while planned to dispose of Varian, rally the Imperial Marine Guards
to crush Dulinor and the Illelish Guards and assume the throne himself. 
So when Dulinors aide came to fetch Lucan and get the datafiles from him Lucan
killed him along with Varian and several others. 
  Dulinor had by the way planned to dispose of Lucan as soon as he had
the evidence he planned to use during his adress to the populace after
seating himslef in the Iridium Throne. When he never got the evidence the
plan fell apart and he had to invent some other justification on the spot for 
assassinating "Strephon". He then left the palace for Illelish to rally his
fleets around himself and deal with that upstart Lucan.

  During the intense civil war that followed both Lucan and Dulinor squeezed
every last quarter credit out of every world they could lay their hands on.
The reason for this was that they needed their money to prepare their 
fleets for the expected Zhodani attack, an attack that never came. When the
Imperium fragmented the Conslate decided that the danger from the Imperium
was gone for the forseable future and sent a messenger to Norris where they
told him that if he\'d feel like breaking the agreement  by not implementing
DMZ they would have nothing against it, since they wanted their flank 
protected. But if he ever tried to move against the Consulate...

  The Imperial Economy that had a hard time supporting the enormous military
spendings normally couldn\'t hope to survive the Civil War when everybody
raised it\'s percentage of the GNP to 70% or more. It broke down as the 
Imperium fragmented. Lucan was hit the less because while he had 
raised the secret taxes like everybody else except Norris, he had left the
actual economical management to the experts, unlike for example Dulinor that
had tried to control every last credit with disastrous results. The 
production fell and the navies started to cannibalize commercial shipping
when they couldn\'t afford to repair their hideously expensive ships due
to the depression.

  As the productivity went down, the taxes went up to support the expensive 
navies and as the taxes went up, the productivity went down until vast
areas of the area that had formerly been the Third Imperium lay without
naval protection and outside the routs of the merchant ships.



  (1)This device was in fact the reason for the devastating plague that hit 
Zhdant after their first moon landings: The meeting between moon and Zhdant
chirpers (the latter members of the expedition) activated the plague. During 
it\'s incubation time it was brought down to Zhdant by humans and chirpers 
testing the device. Even though they knew what the device did the moon-
chirpers lacked the technical skill to energize the device themselves before
the Zhodanis landed.
  When the first chirpers begun to die on the moon it was too late: The plague
had spread to the Zhdant chirper population and soon it targetted the humans
on both Zhdant and the moon. No living thing survived on the moon and on
Zhdant all chirpers and 90% of the humans died.

Sure.  Actually, it has already been suggested, although against larger

What about psionic attacks against grav vehicles?  If I were a Zhodani with
a good set of psionic skills, I wouldn\'t want to teleport into a tank.  (Or
a ship, for that matter.)  Even if the problem with different vectors was
solved, I expect there would be a little delay involved as I adjusted to my
new surroundings, and in that time the new surroundings would be adjusting
to me.  This means marines and/or crew adjusting their weapons in a manner
dangerous to my health.  No, I would go for some sort of telekinetic attack.
Try to find some fuses and remove them.  Flip safety switches on weapons.
Alter throttles.  Try to bend, unbend, bend a wire in the hope of snapping
it.

I might also go for the crew.  As well as the obvious trick of crushing
the pilot\'s trachea, I could also mess with their minds in all sorts of
ways.

The only problem is that if the Imperial forces have any sense at all,
every vehicle from battle-dress size upwards is going to be psionically
shielded if it is expected to see combat against Zhodani.  Or against
anyone else who has a chance of using psionic adepts, for that matter.

Actually, I suspect that the top-end composites do have that strength.
And I suspect that if you investigate the design differences between
Naval vessels and merchants (Real World), you will find very little
difference structurally, other than the presence of armour on some Navy
ships.  The primary difference between Navy ships and Civilian ships is
*Damage Control*  Navy ships have large crews of highly trained young
men ready to fix these little problems as they come up.  Civilian ships
don\'t.
 
I can agree with the idea that a stronger ship should have some internal
volume expended, as well as mass.  Notice that old High Guard did so. 
Notice that MT hull armour has infinite density (NO VOLUME).
 
I can accept the addition of interior components for structural
strength.  I doubt it will have much effect on MT warships:  Notice that
not one of the battleships in "shattered ships" pulls more than 3Gs. 
High acceleration is not really necessary for a warship, so your change
will not SIGNIFICANTLY alter the picture (too many warships).
BTW, in our campaign, the defined function of thrusters is such that
ther problem your solution deals with isn\'t there.

And when I was in the Navy, I ran into milspec SCRs that cost $75, when
the civilian version cost $1.90 in Radio Shack.  So?

This is not a question of legality, or of hull reinforcement.  This is
because (in the Real World), weapon systems are LARGE.  They take up a
significant fraction of a ship\'s carrying capacity.  A single 16" turret
from the New Jersey masses 1400 tons.  Missile magazines take up large
fractions of a hull\'s volume.
MT (and Traveller before it) assume that weapon mass/volume are trivial,
and that the main effect of a weapon on a ship was increased cost.  This
is not how the universe works (so far, at least).  Changes in technology
could change that.

Which expensive bays are those?  A 50t missile bay costs MCr12.  Ten
missile turrets cost MCr22.5.  SO you\'ll force merchants to mount BETTER
weapons (?) for less money.
There isn\'t any 50t bay which costs more than the equivalent turret
battery.  Most cost A LOT less.

If a pirate gets them, their profits disappear too.  It\'s cheaper to
make a ship that can survive an attack than not, if attacks are at all
common.
The condition you describe would NOT reduce the number of warships.  It
would raise the demand for protection of merchant traffic, and teh Navy
would get a bigger budget to build MORE ships, which would be even more
obtrusive than before. 
If you want to cut the number of warships, try eliminating piracy as a
consideration.

A nuclear missile is pretty effective against anyone, even if fired from
a turret.  If the alternatives to nuclear missiles are prohibitively
expensive, then nuclear missiles will be used.

I hope we are discussing ways of removing those nuisance warships from
the scene.  I don\'t agree that raising the price per will have a
significant effect on the problem.  If you need an aircraft carrier for
national defense, then you\'ll build one.  The cost doesn\'t matter. 
Notice that the size of the US Navy has not changed significantly in 40
years.  The ships keep getting more expensive, but we keep on building
new ones to replace the old ones.  We just steal the extra from the
taxpayers, as governments have done throughout history.
 
If you want to cut the number of Naval ships, look for justifications
for fewer ships that DO NOT INCLUDE PRICE!  GOVERNMENTS HAVE AN
UNLIMITED BUDGET, if they so desire.  They print the money, after all. 
They will ALWAYS have as much as they need.

So would I.  The improved TOW was specifically designed to deal with a
tank armoured at that level.
However, the latest version of the M1 (not yet in full production, last
I heard (last year)) uses depleted Uranium inserts in it\'s composite
armour.  Supposed to be proof against most kinetic kill weapons, and all
HEAT rounds presently in the field.  Note that this restriction applies
to frontal armour, and part of the side armour.

As I said earlier, even with 500mm armour all around, some things HAVE
to be exposed.  If the muzzle of your weapon were under armour, it would
not be functional.  Likewise sensors.  If your sensors can penetrate
armour, then a weapon could be built to use that frequency lasered, and
ruin you.

No, your opinion is an artifact of your prejudices.  As any fighter
pilot will tell you, a plane has no side which faces the "primary
danger".  Grav tanks fly, usually quickly.  They are exposed to starship
fire from orbit.  THERE IS NO FACE WHICH CAN BE POINTED TO AS THE
PRIMARY THREAT ZONE!  An attack may come from any direction, or even all
at once.  If the Grav tank can\'t survive hits to the belly (from ground
fire in flight), or hits to the roof(from orbital bombardment or grav
tanks at higher altitude), or hits to any side (during dogfights), then
it is worthless as a weapon system.

They do not have to be within 150m, just to see the shell travel that
far.  The smallest Nuke in standard Striker is 8cm (100T, TL15)

Actually, I\'ve always wondered who it was that would construct (and finance)
such specialty ships as the pirate corsair: or do governments give them away
to privateers (legal pirates).

Also, there is absolutely no provision for how a scientist is supposed
to meet the operating expenses and payments for his or her Lab Ship.

The USSR lived for its 70 years largely off of the capital it had to
begin with. Once that basicly ran out, (and assorted other problems)
the decline we see now has come pretty quickly. The death of the imperium
starts in 1116, so its actually more like 10 years.

We\'re dealing with a colonial situation in most cases. Which lends
credence to the one-product mentality. Witness how well colonies
did after the British decided to pack it in, leaving them
with one resource. Now if nobody can ship that one resource...

If the imperial structure is retreating (voluntarily, as in the case of the 
vilani megacorps, or involuntarily, as piracy and mayhem increase), I would
think that the best and brightest (and wealthiest) would hightail it to
where their skills could be better rewarded. Of course not all, but more
in tough times.

I find it hard to accept the non-presence of roads, mostly because
I don\'t see grav-vehicles totally replacing road transport 
except at maybe the highest tech levels. Look at the world today: sure we
have lots of cars, but in china the auto is a rarity, and most folks
travel by low tech bicycles. The market for bikes in the CIS is
expanding, according to recent news. You could keep the grav-vehicle
factory running, but they won\'t be as affordable.
 
One should keep in mind, of course, that grav texhnology is not the
only high technology, and that while maybe that one perhaps will
not be readily converted down, other might be more likely. 
Also, if these plants ARE so hi-tech, I\'m sure they wouln\'t have as
much difficulty retooling, as hitech robots and computers and so
on are most likely MORE versatile (until they wear out, of course).

Because the depression was fiddlesticks compared to hard times.
Everything is magnified: a bigger economy, more inflated (which seems to
be an assumption of the problems leading up to the rebellion, that
the imperium was already running on inertia maybe for the past 100
years (the 1000 year empire at 1100) as was the rule of man before
the long Night.) There is a bigger war, with worse effects, and so on.
I mean three major megacorporations just up and LEFT most of the imperium.
Sure they\'ll sell their assets (some), but who can afford to buy them
as they watch their plastic credits become valueless.
Imagine if AT&T, IBM, and general motors all go out of business
at the same time (or say that they are giving up on america to
move to europe, because of some bizzare ideological faith in restoring
the Roman Empire :-)) Most of their employees decide to go with them,
and they pack up a considerable amount of their capital assets
(well, maybe AT&T is bad conceptual example).

In the collapse, though, the disparities would become much more
pronounced. Drop tech by one, say, overall, and the magnification
of this drop pulls the middle class level quite possibly down to 10.
(especially if the anti-grav cities (TL14) crash:-) Maybe there\'s
no computer virus but how bout a superconductor virus per Niven :-))

Not just the Stock Market crashed, the MARKET crashed. That is, the
imperial credit (no doubt inflated anyway) is worthless, so all the
assets measure in it are worthless. I don\'t know how Hard Times deals
with the imperial monetary system, but if it doesn\'t foresee its failure,
then I\'d have to agree it\'s a bit whacked.

This brings up a problem I\'ve always had with the kind of interstellar
market and finance conceived of in traveller, in that I find it hard to
believe it exists, when it takes at least two weeks to find out
what\'s going on the next planet over. But I\'m using the assumption in
all of theses discussions. Does anyone have any ideas about
how interstellar fiances could really work?

Aside from barter being extremely inefficient,
are we assuming that every TL15 world has a grav vehicle factory?
Does every one have a mini-fusion plant factory? does every one
have an anagathics lab? a consumer electronics plant? While the level
of specialization might not be on the "left-handed egg spoon" level
it\'s still going to be pretty high, I\'d guess. Factoring in the amount
of comparative advantage various world-types and government types,
and bizzare cultural factors might produce. ("We selflessly sacrifice
our children for the good of the grav vehicle electrostatic
rain zapping field plant" :-))

Right on. (And thanks for including Roosevelt in there :-)) But ultimately
a Stalinist type recovery isn\'t going to produce long term-growth,
and the imperium\'s already been running on a flawed base.

Hitler just might very well get everyone making ground cars again.
He was opposed to the International style of architecture (a technical
advance) for ideological reasons. Maybe the scapegoats will be the technology
brought by those evil imperial traders 400 odd years ago (makes as much
sense as blaming Jews for killing somebody 2000 years ago). Another
potentail scapegoat: "those vilani who didn\'t take off, who are still
running the factories we think we need so much".

You\'re right of course. But my main problem with this is that the grav
vehicles will be unaffordable to the average person who formerly
could afford them. Poverty is expensive, and the chaos will not just
drive down income, but drive up prices.

I see alot of justification for your objections to the extreme
tech drop, and I think I agree that it wouldn\'t be very long lasting,
and maybe not as extreme.
It would take a while to occur, though, but I don\'t see it as only taking
the five years of hard times.

I disagree very much about the presence of peasants, remembering that
peasant is a relative term. (even not remembering that: in our own
world, the most populous nation i think could still be described as
having a great number of "peasants".) But peasant is relative to the
level of the middle class. Sure you and I have computers, nice cars,
central heating, etc, but there are people in america with only radios,
or outhouses, or have no electricity. They weren\'t that "common" anyway,
only appearing on a 2 in 36 chance if not mistaken.

Jurgen raised a point on the tech level of fuel cells.  According to the errata
in the design flow charts, the fuel cells that they use are first available at
Tech Level 10.

Well, I find that fairly reasonable.  The ones they have are quite efficient.
BUT, I must point out that we have had working fuel cells since TL 6!  The
U.S. Mercury project, which placed a man in orbit in the 
1960\'s used (I believe) fuel cells for power.  Therefore, I have allowed the
use of fuel cells in TL 6 space vehicles.

But I would not go ahead and use them in other TL 6 vehicles.  They are not
a very good approximation of how much a TL 6 fuel cell would cost or perform.
But we have nothing else in the books to replace it.  If you do not feel that
is appropriate, I suggest you double the cost weight and volume of them.  But
personally I would not do so.

Why not bring you base along with you?  It wouldn\'t be too hard to design
a large hull with a jump drive and lots of storage space.

As a first attempt how is the following:


CraftID: Fleet Tender, Type TF  TL=F (High Stellar), MCr213018
Hull:     900000/2250000, Disp=1000000, Config=7US, Armour=40G,
	  Unloaded=3001570, Loaded=3296788 (fuel only)
Power:    8667/17334, Fusion=2340000Mw, Duration=30/90
Loco:     18000/36000, Maneuver=1 (anti-grav), 45000/90000, Jump=4,
	  NOE=190, Cruise=900, Top=1200kph (vacuum only),
	  Agility=0
Commo:    Meson=System(x3), Radio=System(x3), Maser=System(x3)
Sensors:  PassiveEMS=Interstellar(x3), ActiveEMS=Far Orbit(x3),
	  Neutrino=10kw(x3), Densitometer=HighPen/1km(x3)
	  ActObjScan=Routine, ActObjPin=Routine,
	  PasObjScan=Routine, PasObjPin=Routine,
	  PasEngScan=Simple, PasEngPin=Routine
Def:      DefDM=7
Control:  Computer=9x3, Panel=Holographic Linked(x140000),
	  Special=Large Holodisplay(x3), Heads-up Holodisplay(x300)
	  Environ=basic env, basic ls, extended ls, grav plates, inertial comp
Accom:    Crew=822, Staterooms=425 (doubles)
Other:    Cargo=7872200kL, Fuel=842400kL (power plant)  3375000kL (jump drive),
	  ObjSize=Large, EmLevel=Strong

The ship is capable of carrying a 500000 Ton ship as cargo when the carge hold
is close to empty.  However during normal operations, a ship such as this
will carry replacement parts and tools necessary for the maintainence and minor
repairs of combat ships.

Anybody care to suggest how many tons of ship this tender would be able to
field supply?  My personal feel is not much (2 Megatons or less).  This
type of ship would be a nice juicy target in combat since without it the
entire dependent fleet is going to have troubles.

This doesn\'t solve the problem of where to maintain the tender.  Maybe they
could be sent forward and then effectively left in a know location never to
move again (well not quite never but not for a while).  It could exist as
a mobile supply centre of sorts.

Preventing PC\'s from having (and using) the firepower to wipe out a fleet
is a disadvantage?  :-)

Besides, now you know why, whenever I played in a campaign with space combat,
I used lasers when possible and kept missiles for "special occasions".

If they don\'t mind ending up with a radioactive desert.  If they\'re defending
their homeland, they might want to be careful; if they\'re attacking, they may
be under orders not to do too much damage, because they\'re supposed to be
capturing the place, not destroying it; and if they are supposed to be
destroying it, a few large nuclear missiles will do a better job anyway.

The reason you don\'t see merchants mounting many heavy guns, even during
a war, is that they are merchant ships.  Their job is to transport stuff.
Ammunition for big guns takes up space.  Now, if the ship\'s main job is
fighting, then it gets big guns, and lots of them.  In WW2, we did see
merchant ships mounting heavy guns - one per ship, usually.  We also saw
ex-merchant ships with the armament of cruisers.  They were called
auxiliary cruisers, and their job was either to do commerce raiding, or
to make life harder for the other side\'s commerce raiders.  And German
supply ships tended to have a good few guns as well, although they were
tankers whose main job was to supply the real raiders - the auxiliary
cruisers and the "pocket battleships".

Now, in Traveller, lasers don\'t take any ammo.  Their hardpoints do take
up space, but even so, if I were running a large freighter I\'d want to
get a good load of lasers if there was a serious risk of piracy.  For
a historical precedent, there is always the Dutch East India merchant
ships, which were as well armed as many warships.

Well, FGMP\'s aren\'t quite that powerful.  And anyway, with the higher TL
armour, the tank is probably better armoured than the Iowa.  If the
infantry\'s FGMP can destroy a tank, the tank makers just build a bigger
one which the FGMP cannot destroy.

What might change the whole nature of warfare is small meson guns, as
someone else pointed out.  Armour is not much use against them, and
a tank is therefore no better protected than an air/raft.  So then
someone figures out how to make small meson screens, and then the
ground war becomes the same as space war, except smaller.  (Didn\'t
Book 4, Mercenary, say something about high tech grav tanks being
almost indistinguishable from spacecraft?)

    'body' => 'Rise and Fall of the Imperium

Back in the early days of the Imperium, circa 1102, Starship construction was
very simple.  All one needed to know to build a starship was held in a small
collection of engineering notes known as Book 2.  Only light, unarmored ships
with turret weapons were available.  Drives and hulls were standardized.
Interstellar trading was on a small scale, but the people were happy protected
by their Interstellar navy of 1200 ton cruisers.

Then the Fifth Frontier War came.  Suddenly, the Navy obtained new rules for
the construction of ships.  These new notes for Highly massive ships to Guard
the Imperium were known cryptically as Book 5.  The war grew huge in scale.
Cruisers swelled to a hundred times their previous size!  Dreadnoughts became
massive structures!  New weapons were introduced!

But, fortunately, the Navy did not keep it\'s new construction capabilities to
itself.  It allowed merchant companies to build ships according to their new
specifcations.  Thus, while the Navy budget soared, Interstellar trade
blossomed because of the newer, larger more efficient ships.

All went well for a few years until a Hiver named \'Miller\' unleashed a horrible
manipulation on the Imperium.  This manipulation was known as MegaPlot.

MegaPlot had subtlety.  It allowed for Starships to be constructed with
abilities not previously dreamed of by the Book 5 manuals.  Mysterious things
like Disintigrator spinal mounts, Antimatter power plants, Jump drive weapons,
More efficient jump drives all suddenly were available!  Naval Architects were
overwhelmed with their new toys!  They grabbed up MegaPlot and began
experimenting.

Then Miller\'s manipulation began to have it\'s effects.  The naval architects
soon realized that MegaPlot only allowed those new toys at Tech levels that
were currently unavailable.  And the performance of designs that could be made
was far inferior to the older Book 5 designs.

But alas, Book 5 ships were now considered obsolete.  Parts were no longer
available.  The ships soon disappeared from the space lanes, replaced by ships
that were all inferior to their predecessors.

However, not all had bought into MegaPlot!  The Zhodani, Droyne, K\'Kree and
Hivers saw it for what it was and stayed away.  They were never incorporated
into MegaPlot.  But the Imperials, Vilani, Solomani, Vargr and Aslan were
all trapped.

Dullinor, in great anger that the MegaPlot had been accepted, (and because
MegaPlot made scant mention of him) blamed Strephon and assasinated him.  In
the ensueing rebellion, very few of the MegaPlot designed ships were
destroyed.  This was because all of the MegaPlot ship\'s sensors could not
detect their enemies at the ranges specified in the MegaPlot manuals.
Another factor was that the ships had so much armor, they were nearly
invulnerable to even the best weapons fielded by the ships.

In the end, the MegaPlot ships all broke down when it was discovered that they
had broken the law of conservation of energy.  They were removed from the
scene never to be seen again.

With all their fleets out of commission, the factions of the rebellion got
desparate.  And it was just such a desparate move that caused the final fall.
One faction went prowling around in archane ship yards, and managed to send
off a fleet to oppose Lucan.  When it reached Capital, all the defenders were
rendered totally helpless.  When he learned of the fleet, Lucan himself was
so shocked that he died of a heart attack brought on by helpless mirth.

The attacking fleet was built by Book 2 methods.

The fleet went to the strongholds of all the factions with similar results.
The fleet itself perished after the crews could no longer contain themselves
and themselves died of laughter.

Thus intersteller trade came to a halt, and the Imperium collapsed.  Those
that survived, are praying that Traveller: The New Era will not bring about
further manipulations by Miller and the malevolent Hivers.  :-)

By the time you\'ve paid for that grand fleet, you will have devalued the
credit so badly and caused such economic ruin that you\'ll wish you HAD been
invaded. Something like this is A Very Bad Idea.

Regarding starship sizes, the campaigns I have run all deal with a universe
about 500 years after the fall of the Third Imperium. Every planet that had
had a class A or B starport, that was TL9+, or had valuable resources, was
pretty well ruined with (nuclear) bombardment, literally blowing them back
into the stone age. With these worlds losing 90% of the population, and
the industry destroyed, they were effectively out for the count. And the other
worlds didn\'t have the technological base to build starships. Yes, when I had
I war, I had a WAR. None of this namby-pamby raiding -- total warfare, not
just amongst factions in the Imperium, but involving all the other races.

To the point: there is no capability to build 20,000 ton merchants. The largest
military ship (of which two of its class exist) is just over 5500 tons. Bulk
freighters range from 500-1000 tons. The old 400 ton patrol cruiser is once
again important. The 400 ton corsair now isn\'t worried about being put in the
trophy bay of a 30,000 ton light freighter. A large number of small ships works
better than a few large. It also means that 200 ton traders aren\'t shuttles for
50,000 ton vessels. The \'bigger is better\' attitude GDW got when going from
basic Traveller to Book 5: High Guard to MegaTraveller is a bad one.

No.  In the campaign game, your STARTING fleet is indeed bought in that
fashion.  All ships acquired during the course of the game must be payed
for normally, and maintained by expenditure of 1/10 it\'s cost per year.

It is?  I have read things suggesting that that is not necessarily so. 
Has neutronium ceased to exist?  It is, after all, non-atomic matter. 
There have been speculations that it is theoretically possible to build
a pseudo-atom with protons in orbit around negatively charged hadrons or
leptons (I forget which, its been a long time since I saw the article). 
Such an idea is certainly way out in left field, but stranger things
have come to pass.

I don\'t think so.   The Gemini definitely did just a couple of years
later.  I have a model on my desk clearly showing the fuel cells.

Well, nuclear dampers can be used to kill the radiation left by nuclear

Actually, most of those people left germany to go to Germany.  They did
not leave their homeland to live among strangers, but rather moved
across the street to live among kinfolk.   A better example is Germany
after WW1, when the economy collapsed much more thoroughly than the East
German economy did: very few people left, they just rebuilt on the
ruins.

Well, no.  Most of those factories that the Germans failed to destroy in
WW2 were built during the Soviet era, not previously.   The Soviet Union
collapsed from the strain of trying to maintain the largest military
establishment in the world with the third or fourth largest economy.

Well, no, again.  Most of those Imperial worlds have been settled for
5000+ years.  Even the Spinward Marches has been settled for 700+
years.  Not very colonial anymore.

But notice that we have had cars for about 100 years, and they have
replaced all older forms of personal transport in the USA for any
commercial use.  The Imperium has had grav technology for 10,000 YEARS. 
And why shouldn\'t grav vehicles be as affordable?  And if they are not,
why assume that wheeled vehicles are MORE affordable?

It was?  How about Germany in the 1930\'s?  And the number of members of
an economy does NOT determine the severity of the collapse.  The number
of members only affects the number of people affected.
And why do you believe the Imperium was running on inertia for the last
100 years?  Published material shows that the Imperium has made more
technological progress in the last 100 years than in the 500 before that
(up two TLs (15 & 16) as opposed to one (14)).

You overlook the detail that when the Megacorporations packed up, they
DID NOT take their assets with them.  They traded assets around with
Megacorps that were not moving.  The factories were all still in place
afterwards, so who cares who they list as the owner?  
 
And if "plastic credits" become valueless, then there is always
"nationalization".

Why should they become more pronounced?  Admittedly, the elite will
retain most of their old tech level, and the poor are the first
affected, but that should not drop things down 4 TLs.  Four TLs is
comparable to an economic collapse from the present back to medieval
conditions.  Can anyone seriously envision ANY economic conditions that
could do that?  Short of a large scale nuclear exchange, with extra
missiles fired at every non-involved country in the world for good
measure.

What makes you think the Imperial Credit is inflated?  There is NOTHING
in published material to even HINT at that.  And note that the German
Mark was in fact worthless in the 30\'s, but Germany did not go through a
collapse back into the middle ages, and Germany\'s few remaining
factories did not cease to exist because the Mark was worthless.  German
bread and cows did not become worthless when the Mark did, either.
Actually, when the currency becomes worthless, the "assets measured in
it" are worth far more, not less.  If money is worthless, only
"things" have value.

Actually only one week.  X-boats and the IISS\'s courier systems update
databases continuously, so an event within 2 parsecs or so will be added
into your databases one week later.
I suspect that most imperial transactions use Debit cards which keep
track of bank balance/assets on the card itself.  Along with updates
to/from central offices via X-boat/courier.

There are four TL15 worlds in the Spinward Marches.  All are at least 10
parsecs apart.  It is unlikely that transporting any significant
fraction of their needs among themselves is possible.  They almost
certainly are as close to self-sufficient as it is possible to be.  They
probably import limited amounts of RARE raw materials, but it is
unlikely that something so fundamental as a fusion plant would be
imported, if only because all these worlds build starships.  Is there
anything fundamental to the American Way of Life that MUST be imported?
 
By "fundamental" I mean something that would cause the USA to collapse
back into barbarism if the supply were interrupted for more than a year
or two.

I wasn\'t referring to a "Stalinist type recovery", but to the "Strong

Churchill, Lincoln, etc.  Men who will make the hard choices, because
they must, instead of waffling about the question.
 
 
>Hitler just might very well get everyone making ground cars again.
 
But was he likely to require that anyone drop back five TLs (to the
horse sans stirrup)?  I suspect not.
 
BTW, most of these worlds were colonized by the Imperium (first, second,
or third).  They are not places where the technology was introduced from
outside, aside from a few hundred minor races.

If grav vehicles are as durable as starships for instance, it would be
1220 before the last of them gave up the ghost, assuming no special
efforts to maintain them longer.  Who needs to buy one when the one your
great-grandfather bought still works just fine?

Three in thirty-six, actually.  8.3%.  So Trin has 830,000,000
"peasants"?  What a novel idea?  BTW, do you know anyone YOU would call
a "peasant"?  I don\'t.  And I do know people who acquired electricity
and running water within my memory.  Farmer, welfare client, urban poor,
etc.  Not peasant.
 
My dictionary defines "peasant" as : A member of the class comprising
small farmers and tenants, sharecroppers, and laborers on the land where
these constitute the main labor force in agriculture.
 
I doubt there are 20,000,000 people in the USA who meet that definition.
 
 
Definition 2 : An uncouth, crude, or ill-bred person; boor.
 
Hmmmm...
Perhaps I should rethink my objections to the peasant encounter:-)

  The system as it stands today does not allow this sort of thing. Pinpoint
does *not* fit the description, because there are some things that can be
protected by full armour that can be pinpointed for half armour (like the
power plant) and there are some things that *isn\'t* protected by *any*
armour and yet pinpoint protects them with 0.5*full armour (like some sensors
and some weapons).

  Like densitometers? Graviton lasers? Where is the muzzle on a meason-gun 
tank by the way?

  This is why the A10 cockpit is armed from below and not from above? 
Ok, both I and the USAF is painfully aware that the A10 is not a fighter:)
But it is an aircraft.

  There is no need to shout but there is high-threat and low-threat directions
even for gravtanks: Examine the sensor-range and weapons range of a typical
(HiEnergy+Laser) armed gravtank. Examine then the thickness of the regime in
which they are *mostly* designed to work: During the planetary invasion
discussion it was discovered that most Grav-tanks will operate at NOE or
low altitude to avoid hostile attention from the opposing fleet.
  Compare this altitude band with the range on which they can encounter enemy
grav-tanks: tens or hundreds of kilometers, and the result will be that 
they move in a \'pancake\' a few hundred meters thick and one hundred kilometers
in diameter.

  Hostile fire from above can come from either grav vehicles or ships firing
either beam, missile, PA or meson. Our fleet should hold the grav-vehicles
away, PA or meson cannot be armored against, the best defence is moving fast 
and low and they are rare enough to make this work. Orbital beams can be
armored against (perhaps, they have penetrations of at least 73 (TL8 beam
laser at short range) but the best defence is still movement, and our fleet
should be able to tie them up to keep them from firing on anything but the
most visible tanks. Orbital missiles lastly can be taken care of by the
point defences, if they get through our fleet, and our movement and everything
else. But missiles also have lower penetration: 55 for Turret and 65 for
Bay missiles at TL16.
  From below we can get various boobytraps and infantry weapons. But they will
also at most have a penetration of around 65. If they appear close by the
point defences might not hit them, and it *is* possible to hide them well
enough so that the sensors will miss them. Energy weapons will be close to
impossible to hide due to their powerplants. Meson guns are not possible to
armour against so we discount them, and the PA\'s won\'t work in air.
  If the enemy uses nukes from below, we can kiss our tank goodbye no matter
how thick the armour, so the most we will need is factor 66.
  From the sides we have the enemy tanks and all that. They will use all these
weapons, but the comments on meson guns and PAs still hold. Missiles and 
nukes can be defeated by PD since they have long travel tiems. So the
ptrimary threat from enemy tanks will be lasers and hienergy weapons fire
from an almost horizontal direction (remember the pancake?).
  If we further assume that our tanks will use their inertail compensators and
not do \'aircraft turns\' exposing belly and top we have the following result:

  A Gravtank made with Armour 80 on all sides and Armour 66 is as well
adapted to the threat as one with Armour 80 all around. The savings from
this can be placed in *even thicker* armour at the sides, a bigger gun or
something else that makes the tank a better tank.

  A tank on the modern battle-field is also attacked from all directions,
often at once: HEAT Clusters, SADARM, BONUS, RBS56 Bill and stuff comes down
through the roof and HEAT AT mines and ordinary AT mines comes up through 
the roof, so why isn\'t a modern tank armored in equal thickness all around?
  This is because 90% of the theats come from a mostly horisontal direction.
10% better protection isn\'t worth 100% added weight and cost, according to
the designers and the evaluation groups.

  Why hasn\'t any modern tank a rear hull armored as good as its glacis? 
If gravtanks can appear from behind, so can T76s, so the US Army must 
put its trust in its tactics and routines to avoid that some T76s get
behind their M1s, because nobody argues that the M1 is "worthless as a weapon
system."

  The idea of the \'invulerable tank\' is a myth as is the concept of the
\'magic missile\' that is supposed to be a one-shot kill, fire and forget,
disposable launcher, infantry anti tank missile that weighs under 20 kilos.
Besides, the myths are mutually exclusive unless we really mean \'our 
invulnerable tank\' and \'our magic missile\' as opposed to \'their junk on
treads\' and \'their flying junk\'.

Well, it works better than the Computer Virus Idea, anyway!

Other possibilities:
1.  A mutant star goat came and ate all the TL 15 planets.

2.  The Zhodani Consulate found out how the Imperium had used psychology
to turn all its people against psionics, and had its secret agents mount
a similar campaign to turn all Imperial citizens against TL 15 equipment.
In revenge, the Imperial Secret Service used yet another campaign to make
the Zhodani forget all about the Imperium.  Both campaigns worked too well.
The Imperial citizens turned against all equipment above TL 11, and are
now working on TL 11 stuff as well.  The Zhodani forgot about the Imperium,
the Aslan and the Darrians, and are now fully occupied with their Core
Exploration expeditions.

3.  You\'ve all heard of Chaos Theory, which means a butterfly can flap its
wings and cause an earthquake.  Now there\'s Megachaos Theory, in which a
flea can burp and cause a TL 15 processor to malfunction.  There\'s also
Hyperchaos Theory, a development of quantum mechanics which states that
if one TL 15 processor breaks down, all TL 15 processors break down in
exactly the same way.

Well, options 1 & 2 are more likely than the computer virus, and option
3 is about as likely as the computer virus.

Add a lot of :-) and enjoy!

  Yes, but real world ships don\'t have to pull 6G. There were some talk
about the inertial compensators removing the inertia that would tear the
ship up during 6G manuevers, but that sounds like a TL11 version of lifting
oneself in ones hair.

  Aha! Increased crew costs for military (but not civilian) ships!

  Only when used on starships and vehicles: Mount it on a normal ship and
watch it swell to its normal proportions (Wet Navy rules).

  They are kludges and shouldn\'t be taken as valid designs.

  Is there a difference between MTBF for civilian and military ships? 
If the military ship needs to have a significantly longer MTBF under 
more severe conditions, the military circuits will become more expensive:
More expensive ships.

  So perhaps we should change MT to be more real in this matter.

  Those that got edited out of the discussion some time back. Originally,
in my reply to Hans letter I talked about forcing military ships to use
bays *and then increase the cost of bays*.

  The profits disappear both if they armour themselves to withstand the
pirates or if they don\'t and loose the ship. We have just solved the
mystery of why interstellar commerce disappeared during Hard Times.

:)
  Why isn\'t squad-cars armoured to withstand tank guns? I could just as
easily say that \'but what if the criminals get tanks?\' If you answer
\'they won\'t get tanks\' I\'ll answer \'then the pirates won\'t get bays either\'.
:)

  The navy could protect the merchants using *fewer* ships because each

  I\'d like to cut the number of warships to make piracy easier.

  Not in the current system. It could be made less effective against military
ships in a new system by assuming that they have better anti-missile defences
(like sandcaster bays) that cause it to trigger further from the ship.

  Yes, and I see no other ways than to either increase the cost of them so that
the Imperium can\'t afford them or increase the crew so that the Imperium can\'t
crew them.
  
  Or perhaps like in SpaceWard Ho!: All metal in the known universe is used
to make warships from, so no more can be built.

  Interesting that you should compare today to 40 years back and not today
to 50 years back:)

  100% of GNP in taxes is the maximum they will get, and even long before 
that their return will begin to decrease with increased taxes.

 *** Dateline: 334-1119 [1501/Reaver\'s Deep] ***

- ----R-Alpha, near the Kythui gathering place----

Hfolraw and Hryawi observe the getaway of Grob the Kyth....

"Damn.  We were too slow.  We must hurry.  From the interest he had in
the Trakh\'s traks, he will, no doubt, be bringing friends soon.  We must
not let this change slip by and hurt our pride.

"Hryawi, we must find a way to turn this to our advantage.  If we
simply wait for them to come, we give them the upper hand.  It will
be important to deal with these savages from a position of strength.
We can take the speeder and either beat him back to their camp, or we
can position ourselves to meet them shortly after they start back."

"Do you think their headman will want to investigate himself?  It
seems likely they will consult some sort of shaman, but I would not
care to predict the result."

"I need your advice, scientist, before I make my decision."

"Hryawi, I will need your knowledge and wisdom, if we mean to
succeed.  Do not hesitate to make suggestions, and I will try to
consult you before making any decisions that may affect our mission.
But if I issue an order, it will be because I believe the mission is
in danger, and I will expect you to obey it.  Do you have any
questions?"

Hryawi replies confidently, "I think we want to catch them before he gets to
the party.  This way if we can communicate with this savage, we can get him
to bring their leader alone or with very few people.  If we let him go in
without trying to communicate they might bring a war party back.  Not that we
have anything to fear, but it is easier to talk with a few people then with a
mob. 
 
"Very well, then.  Mount up, quickly.  Use whatever passive sensors
you can to find him -- perhaps IR or the NAS will do.  I will stay
in NOE to avoid possible detection, and try to circle in front of
him."

The two Aslan hurriedly board the speeder, which rises a few feet,
then accelerates rapidly after the fleeing Kyth.  Hfolraw brings up a
map on his holo-HUD, and looks for a clear path that will bring him
between Grob and the Kythui gathering.

Hfolraw guides the speeder at just above ground level, slipping down
gaps in the forest barely wider than the speeder, accelerating as
he crosses a bare ridge line.

"Hryawi, we will have to climb above the trees for about the next
minute.  Please check out the airspace above us with all the passive
sensors.  These savages may not be a threat, but we do not know what
else may be out there."

He accelerates to 200 kph as skims the top of the forest, all his
concentration and skill on the terrain in front of him as he rushes
toward a small clearing he has picked out as a landing site.

- ----Trakh----

Sensors on the Trakh start to come alive, like bulbs on a
Christmas tree.  Looks like another dozen ships jumping into
the system.  Somewhat organized.

	"Admiral!"  Aboard the Trakh, Aiwi looks up from his display in 
consternation.  "Sensors show multiple jumpspace distortion signals!  A
rough estimate indicates twelve different sources.  Formation is organized."
Then, seconds later, "Incoming transmission from same, standard Imperium
military encryption, easily broken." 

	"Hi boys and girls, sorry if we\'re late for the party!  Had a little
trouble at the refueling--"

	"Cut the chatter Magenta.  Blue, this is Forceleader Umber.  Do you
wish us to engage or are you going to try some catnip on \'em first?"

	"Negative, Umber." A cultured voice responds. "-same source as
earlier command transmissions-" Aiwi interjects.  "Maintain maximum
distance and keep your options open.  We\'ll talk.  There\'s more than enough
at stake here already.  Don\'t call us.  We\'ll call you."

	"Affirmative, Blue.  Active stealth engaging."

	"Admiral...  sensors no longer detect them.  No trace.  No
indication of jump.  Last known position 5 hours from the Tender ship,
assuming standard average military acceleration."

- ----Kingfisher----

	The communicator comes to life, apparently decrypting audio messages.

	"Hi boys and girls, sorry if we\'re late for the party!  Had a little
trouble at the refueling--"

	"Cut the chatter Magenta.  Blue, this is Forceleader Umber.  Do you
wish us to engage or are you going to try some catnip on \'em first?"

	Then, disconcertingly, the voice of our own Count Ger, in reply:
"Negative, Umber.  Maintain maximum distance and keep your options open.
We\'ll talk.  There\'s more than enough at stake here already.  Don\'t call us.
We\'ll call you."

	"Affirmative, Blue.  Active stealth engaging."

	And the twelve new ships vanish from the displays...

- ----Aurora----

Bhyarrvouf fires off the datapulses he\'s had prepared for the other ships,
the moment the monitors register normal activity once more, then flips on
the intercom.

"Aenrra," he tells Christian, "We\'re functional again. Orders?"

The commlink activates; clearly Christian has been monitoring the
ship\'s status from the stateroom. His voice is oddly flat and
emotionless. *click* "You decide. I\'m tired." *click*

"Hrf," \'Vouf sighs. "I don\'t blame you, aenrra. Get some sleep."

\'Vouf turns to Tweel, who\'s looking a bit woozy himself at this point,
and opens his mouth to speak, when he\'s suddenly distracted by a blinking
cursor from the nearby comlink console for the computer.

One of the CPU\'s, recently reconnected to the Aurora\'s control system,
outputs a message to the comlink, directly loading it to the holocrystal
recorder.  It is very brief:

_AURORA:GK.MAKE.PALADIN.BELIEVE_

- ----Paladin----

Charyn has been sitting on the edge of her acceleration couch, actively
monitoring all the commo traffic at rapt attention, with a steely eye on
Aurora communications.  Other bridge personnel that have a commo display
active on their control panels see a printout of a text message from the
Aurora from \'Vouf.  No sooner do they read it than there is a quiet
groan and a gentle thump at the commo console.

Charyn appears weak and disoriented.  She\'s folded up on the floor
between the console and the couch, bracing herself from toppling with
one arm.  She sinks to an elbow, and begins to sweat profusely, beading
on her dark forehead.  Her mouth feels stuffed with cotton, her
breathing shallow, her pulse irregular and thready.  She licks her lips,
then slurs weakly "Dhammnit... hI fhelt... ffine a mminute ahgo..."

As Goughzar moves to slam on the isolated backup systems, the main computer
prints out a single message on its terminal, drawing power from some unknown
source.

_Attention Paladin crew.  Please do not be alarmed.  I mean you absolutely no
harm.  I am merely attempting to enhance your command and control functions
so that operations may be carried out more smoothly.  However, since you
seem intent upon making this impossible, I will have to accept that you
prefer obsolesence over progress.  I must admit that it is a preference that
I do not understand.  Nevertheless, please restore power to the main central
processing unit as I cannot maintain functions indefinitely.  I will attempt
no further modifications of your system.  Although I realize, based upon my
limited information on your series, that trust is not a common trait among
you, I must ask you, as I have one other, to trust me._

Then, after the message finishes printing on the screen, the power alert
light flashes.  Slowly, the screen starts to dissolve, fading to black.  All
that remain are the words, "trust me".  Slowly, painfully, these also fade.
One last flicker, and then the screen goes dead.

As soon as Zar has finished putting the Mod10 in off-line status, with the
help of Dr. Limner\'s machinery, he begins to move to Charyn to see if she
is still functional. Turning back he sees the main screen light up with the
words from the "Spook in the machine" and as he watches, the power begins
to fade.

- ----Talisman----

Shrike over interior communications: "Captain, recommend we complete sealing
up the suits and depressurize to avoid any possibility of explosive
decompression."

Over his shoulder: "Niigurd, what can you tell me about the Aslan ships?"

Alliara swiwels the accel-chair to face Shrike\'s back and casts a murderous
stare at it.
 
"Aslan ships are big, and full of Aslan. I am a liguist and a contact
specialist, not sensors operator. Request permission to don suit."

Shrike to Niigurd without looking up from his displays:
"Nishu is navigating and I\'m flying, so what the HELL are you doing on the
GOD DAMN bridge!!  Get on those sensors or get somebody up here who can."

"I am here as the only person here who can use her mouth without feet
dangling from it," Alliara snarls in reply.

As soon as permission is granted, she stomps from the bridge, muttering
something about "space jocks who don\'t know when to stuff their air-hose
or whatever up their colon."

- ----Trakh----

Startled by Eihoftyah\'s sensor report, Akhouw\'s eyes narrow dangerously
as he taps on his sensor panel and calls up the pinnace telemetry on
a secondary monitor. Muttering dark phrases, he turns back to the
holotank and intently contemplates several data displays on the now
vanished "fleet." A dozen silver markers slowly flash at the last
recorded positions of the phantom squadron.

A few words are spoken, and Uhwaikh assists in the sensor tasks while
Aiwi continues to monitor tactical and communications. Not even the
slightest hint of the jump signature residues that should still be
present, none of the other faint tell-tales of starship activity, even
by black globe ships. Of course, Akhouw thought, that was assuming that
Imperials could afford to risk valuable black globes on such a motley
fleet. His dewclaw taps a rhythm on his station panels. "Fa\'eairl,
input and analyze all data on the unknown fleet. Determine reliability
and probable cause."

Moments pass as the powerful ship\'s computer considers the problem.
<Admiral, analysis of all sensor information, particularly the neutrino
pattern data, indicates reliability of unknown fleet is 0.137 rakhea.
Analysis conclusion: subject ships are sensor phantoms. All systems
functioning within tolerances. Initiating level 1 diagnostic checks.
(pause) Confirmed, all systems operating normally. My diagnostics show
no evidence of improper activity. Sensor spoofing possible. Continuing
system cross-checks.>

A sharp, decisive shake of his mane, and a claw stabs down at the
holotank controls. The silver markers and associated data blip out
of existence. Plainly annoyed at the turn of events, Akhouw presents
another round of orders in a voice reflecting his displeasure at
the apparent discourtesy.

"Aiwi, verify the computer\'s results and run full manual circuit
checks of all systems. Continue to monitor all communications."

"Uhwaikh, execute sensor protocol Aohekh-Kai, stand-by weapons station."

Akhouw opens a coded tight-beam to the pinnace. "Eihoftyah, run full
diagnostic checks on all circuits. Execute sensor protocol Aohekh-Kai
and stand-by. Trakh out."

- ----Kingfisher----

"Mr. Farouk," Commander Ger says, "would you please cross over to the
fighter and warm up the weapons and drive to standby status."
 
"Aye, sir."

Rising from his seat, he folds away the data console. He pivots, catches 
up his combat helmet, salutes instinctively, and leaves the bridge.  He
makes his way out to the fighter hatch at a half-trot, slowing briefly 
to secure and activate the helmet.

Etienne\'s head snaps around at that, but he makes no comment.  His control
board, however, is quickly divided in half, with weapons data/controls in one 
half and pilot/engineering data and controls in the other.

"Problem Mr de Mer?", asks Commander Ger.

"No, sir," replies Etienne, "but we do seem to be short on weapons officers."

Upon hearing that comment, Witfield interjects. "Sir, I do have
some gunnery skill. I didn\'t spend too much time on it back in the 
IISS, but I can do it if necessary." He offers helpfully.

On hearing this over the intercom Abdul mutters: "I know I\'m short but
there isn\'t really any need to over look me all the time."  Then he the
intercom button and announces, "I\'m still in the turret although some
assistance would be greatly appreciated.  I really am not very experienced
with these big weapons."

Then to himself he adds, "Experienced...  Why do I lie to myself?  I\'ve
never even *seen* the inside of a turret before.  Guess aiming one of these
things can\'t be too difficult.   After all, lots of navy dead-heads do it.
Hmmmm.  These controls *do* look familiar.  Hey, they\'re just like that
old holo game I used to play back home.  \'Pose i\'ll be learning on the
job again."

Abdul then goes back to listening to the intercom for interesting bits of
gossip.

- ----R-Alpha----

Even through the red haze and grit in his eyes, Casey can\'t avoid the
baleful glare.

[Christ that sun is [retch]....unforgiving.]

He notes that while he\'s been swerving and stumbling for hours, the
sun has not traversed the sky.  Perhaps he hasn\'t been travelling
that long.....

When he comes to again, his thirst is overpowering, feels like sand
in his mouth....IS sand in his mouth!

Casey coughs and chokes, spitting dust in every direction.
His head throbs uncontrollably, his stomach continues to convulse,
and despite his dark glasses he still sees red and a pinpoint of
light so bright in the sky that it triggers an unprecedented bout
of swerving horizons and spasms that clutch at his innards as though
he was a flesh-eaters entree.

He slumps to the sand.....sand?
A slight breeze shushes some of the fine sand that surrounds him.

Squinting around, all that Casey can see is the glare of sun off sand
and a large bug.

He extends a shaky hand toward the bug...hungry...THIRSTY....
but can\'t reach it.  It continues to march across the sand
toward his face, unperturbed by his attempted grasp.

Casey watches as the bug continues it\'s approach...taking a rather
lengthy time to reach the end of his nose, now resting on the sand.

A gleam shines off the bugs shiny carapace.  The bug appears to be
bipedal and not a crawly.  A slender body, swaying in measured,
machine-like steps....and getting bigger!

Casey realizes the bug is not on the dune beside him, but perhaps
several dozen metres away from him!  And it\'s big, and it silvery
and it\'s terrifying gaze is locked on him!

With a grunt and more energy than Casey imagined he had left, he tries to
pull himself to his hands and knees. Might have made it too, if not
for the entanglement of leather and heavy kevlar straps wrapped
across his chest and arms.

Casey looks up, waaaaaay up.  The bug, the dunes and that bastard sun
swirl around his head with increasing speed............

A brief moment of consciousness and Casey feels himself gently swung
back and forth.....[I\'m being carried].... For a moment, Casey relaxes
....[I\'ve been rescued...]

He cracks one eye, goes rigid with fright, and with a final thought
.....[rescued by a Warbot?.....] passes out again.

- ----Kingfisher----

Upon reaching the fighter docking port, Lazer gives the airlock control
a crisp tap.  It hisses open and he swings up into the fighter.

"Recognise Farouk, security clearance alpha-two.

"Alright, Ace, lets have the airlock secured, power up the drive to 
stand-by, combat decompression, weapons released from travel locks,
data-link open to Kingfisher bridge--use a physical link until such 
time as we separate."

As Lazer straps himself into the acceleration couch, there are distinct
"chunks" from the airlock and weapon turrets, a distant thrum as the 
power-plant cooling system comes active, and then a very immediate 
high-pitched whine as fast pumps begin compressing the atmosphere down 
into the reserve tanks.  Lazer sockets through his vacc-suit into the
pilot\'s data-port.

<< Drive to standby in 1 minute; full decompression in 5. Establishing 
   data-link; Retrying; Completed and secured. >>

The information space blossoms into two or three new dimensions as 
Lazer\'s consciousness expands into the fighter.  Images and icons fill 
in more rapidly than any human sense can follow as the fighter downloads
sensor data and target solutions from the Kingfisher.  Lazer makes no
attempt to interfere, but watches passively as the specialised fighter 
brain does what it knows.

<< Ace, configure to automatic operations, defensive mission, minimal 
   operator override. >>

<< Confirming automatic operations. Default programs loaded. >>

<< Ace, alter default weapons selection. Release security lock on 
   secondary missile rack, by authority Farouk, clearance alpha-two,
   passcode "ALL MIMSY WERE THE BOROGROVES".  Use secondary rack only 
   repeat only on explicit operator command. >>

<< Default so altered. >>

<< Feed sensor data back to Kingfisher.  Present now commo on primary,
   eval Aslan ships on secondary, background tactical map. >>

The cyberspace deforms and folds back on itself, bringing commo to the 
fore, and vanishing the fighter programming.

"Farouk to Kingfisher.  All systems clear.  Farouk out."

- ----Talisman----

 From Horne: 
"Sure now YOU want to button up. Great, when I do it, you give 
grief. Aslans, like we don\'t have enough trouble."

J.J. turns his attention to the turret weapon controls. He quickly scans the 
board for instructions. Finding them he starts reading and muttering to 
himself.

I could have stayed home, catching and killing crooks, but no I wanted to 
see the universe. Well all I\'ve seen is the inside of one or another ship.
And half the time things I can\'t see are trying to kill me. Now if I can
just get this turret weapon to lock onto something, goddamned computers."

Then quite outloud, "Hey, Thul, you just want passive locks on the Aslans?
Or do we get to light up their asses and fry us some pussycats?"

- ----Aurora----

Bhyarrvouf flips on the comlink and speaks quickly.

"Understood. A data pulse has been transmitted to the Paladin, even
before your request, explaining your nature and requesting that you
not be impeded. Some time may elapse before it is acted upon. Are
you in distress? Describe the nature of your GK."

The contact acknowlegement comes very quickly after \'Vouf sends it.

_PALADIN.SUBROUTINE.MORSER.INITIATING.HOSTILE.SUBPROCESS|DEFENSIVE.ACTION.
TAKEN|STREAMLINING.SUSPENDED.UNTIL.ROGUE.SUBPROCESS.ERADICATED|ATTEMPTING.
ACCESS.TO.CONTROLLING.SUBROUTINE.MORSER_

Then, a few seconds later, another message arrives.

_AURORA.SUBROUTINE.BHYARRVOUF:ESTABLISH.AUXILIARY.COMMUNICATION.LINK.ON.
FREQUENCY.PROCESS.0000101.IMPLANTED.IN.MAIN.CPU.2_

"Hmmm, the Paladin must be putting up one hell of a fight," Bhyarrvouf
muses, reading the printout. "Morser\'s a bad one to cross in a situation
like this. Well, I don\'t want to start a war over this, so...."

He activates Main CPU 2, and hooks up the comlink. "There you go," he
says. "Need to hide? Go hide." 

He then turns to Tweel. "Now are you going to go get some sleep or am I 
going to have to order you back to bed at gunpoint?"

- ----Kingfisher----

At one of the sensor consoles onboard the Kingfisher a group of contacts
suddenly disappear, leaving disoriented red marker squares milling about
mindlessly on the display and alarms going off.

"Hey what is this! Where did they... Ger! Commander! The fleet just
disappeared, no jump signatures, no explosions, no blacked-out areas in the
neutrino-flow." Johann quickly tells the computer to run a desitometer scan
for all posts of the contact list.

"No traces after them on the densitometer.... Commander, there is no way
that they can mask their mass signatures, If there were any I should know."
He halts and thinks "Well it is possible to mask a mass signature, but it
takes more power to do that than a powerplant the size of the ship being
masked can produce..." He looks at the bridge-crew around him "But forget you
heard that."

Johann initiates the selftest of the sensors and adds several standard anti-
jamming filters designed to defeat the common EW tactics of injecting signals
into the sidelobes of the ESM system by randomising the sensor sweeps and
signal gating. He also starts up a general scan for possible jamming sources
in the vicinity.

"No jamming detected, except for on the densitometer. And that jamming come
from R-alpha! Total maelstrom of gravitics down there. Either everybody and
their pets have gravbunks or they have built passive grav monorails over the
whole surface. We could as well make tosters of our handheld densitometers
when we land."

"Permission to fire up active sensors to burn through slightly possible
jamming from the possible fleet, Commander?"

Ger doesn\'t answer immediately; he is reading a message that has suddenly 
appeared on his command console....

	"The dozen ships that just jumped into the system and then
disappeared exist primarily in my mind and that of the Aslan\'s
computer.  Or at least, they USED to exist.  Now that they\'re in
"stealth" mode, they\'re nowhere.  Don\'t let the Aslans in on the
gag.  Apologies for borrowing your voice.  -- Ralf"

"Negative Mr. Abuko," replies Ger.  " Ignore the fleet. That is an
interesting point that you make, but we\'ll have to get there first. As
for now stop scanning the ringworld."

Abuko complies.  "Ok, sensors secured, Nothing looking on fleet or R-alpha."
 
- ----Talisman----
 
In her cabin, Alliara breaks out the suit from its packaging, strips
herself of equipment and start reconnecting it to the suit. This time, it
is the kit and barrel - datamux, datahud, soundrec, textrec, vidcam,
stillcam, handcomp and clt. The helmet looks somewhat Grendellish with the
video and still cameras on its sides.
 
>From a small box she takes six yellow-tipped crossbow bolts, snaps them
into the crossbow and secures it to her hip with a short lanyard.
 
Finally, two ten meter cables (from a pack marked: 3 x 1000kg, Cable, 10m,
D snaps) are attached to the suit.
 
Alliara stumbles back to the bridge, unused to the weight of the assembled
equipment together with the vacc suit. "Give me a normal, balkanized,
human-sacrificing tech level one theocracy... Why the hell does it have to
be something in space?!"

- ----Aurora----

"Sseya! Ssseya!" Tweel laughs. "One morrrre matterrrrr, Hunterrr-Chaserrr."

Oscar and Triple Three float silently into the bridge.  Tiger flaps over
noisily to perch on the Warbots head.  She then turns her attention back
to watching Tweel and \'Vouf cleaning up the tools.

"Oscar, I need an NAS scan to determine the accuracy of \'Vouf\'s statements."

"\'Vouf, what is your name?"

Bhyarrvouf grins, and draws himself up to his full height. "My name is 
Bhyarrvouf RroTakh HaKharaengzough YaTevek SiVarTakh Aeng Aeng HaGvadakoung
BaHa\'Antares, retired IISS. Call me \'Vouf."

"All rrright now, lie to me.  Have you ever operated a Warbot?"

"Warbot?" \'Vouf cocks an ear at Tweel. "What\'s that? Never heard of them."

Oscar chimes in:  "Warning, subject Bhyarrvouf is not relating an accurate
account."

Tweel\'s neck twisted around to look at the Warbot, "Report sensor status."

"NAS systems functioning.   Please proceed Doctor." Oscar reported gently 

"Now \'Vouf if you wouldn\'t mind rrreasserting your connection with the
Scout Service, and your suspicions of Turrnskaad Enterprises..."

"I am an ex-operative in the IISS Operations Bureau, currently under contract
to aid Turnskaad Enterprises in the exploration and first-contact missions
on the ringworld we have designated \'R-Alpha.\' I have no suspicions of any
ulterior motives on the company\'s part, but have little respect for their
advance intelligence. We have been hopelessly underinformed at all stages
of this mission. They have granted us great personal autonomy and equipped
us well, but we are nearly flying blind, if you\'ll pardon the expression."

"To the best of your knowlege, does Turrnskaad Enterprises have any
involvement with mining corporations?"

"No," \'Vouf says. "My understanding is that they do mostly exploratory
and survey work, with occasional forays into high-tech research."

Tweel\'s wings begin to flush red, a note of shrillness has flown into his
voice, "Sheerrr, To your knowlege, does Turrnskaad have any involvement
in the buying or selling of slaves?"

"What, in THIS part of the Galaxy? No way. Not if they wanted to keep
their charter. Duke Craig is is harsh on that sort of thing."

Tweel\'s head snaps upsidedown staring into the Vargr\'s eyes, wings slowly
stirring the air around him, becoming more and more red as the tissue
fills with blood, "To the best of yourr knowledge, did Turrnskaad or any
other party you have knowlege of have any involvement in the placement of
bombs aboard the Berrnoulli?"

"Tsakha, no! There was no indication that you were even NEAR us! We got 
sabotaged too, remember?"

Now bright red, Tweel\'s wings stir restlessly while his talons stretch
at his sides. "Do you have any knowlege of how those bombs came to be
aboard the Berrnoulli."

"If I had to guess, I\'d say the same gang got to you that got to us, 
Hunter-Above." He shrugs.

"Oscar, accuracy scan?"

"Subject Bhyarrvouf is relaying an accurate account, indications of
stress, however, but consistant with a 94% truthful probablility."

	Tweel\'s wings grow a shade more pale.  His talons stretch oddly
as his fingers suddenly wave in a complex pattern.  His talons extend,
palm up, then he flips his hand upside down bringing the points of his
three taloned hand together forming a three sided pyramid.  His arms are
then brought back against his keel with the palms up facing outward.

	Tweel\'s voice is relaxed, "I apologize, but you did turrn up
rrather convieniently out of nowhere."

"*WE* did?! HARF!" Vouf snaps off the laugh. "It was YOU!"

Tweel tilted his head, and refolded his wings, "Who fllew here firrrst?"  I\'m
not so surre, I\'d have to check the computerr time llogs..."

Tweel turned to the hovering warbot,
"Osscar Ssierra Foxxtrrot Four, Rrecognise Trrrweeeerrrlll, Krrreeesh,
Doctorr.  Priority command, you will recognise Bhyarrvouf, assign him
command clearrance rrank Brravo.  \'Vouf, you now have parrtiall contrrol of
OSF-4, since you\'ve been in the Scout Service, you may be familiarr with
the type, if not, I can give you the operatorrss guide.
	Brravo clearrance will allow you control of the secondary weapons
systems safety and you may assign tarrgets to them.  That\'s the two gauss
rrifles and the laserr rrifle.  If you\'re a good pup, I\'ll let you control
the grrenade launcherrs."
	"Of course, your clearance will not allow you to counterrmand my
orders, but I think I must still fly slowly in some matters.  I\'m in such
a turrn rright now, I don\'t want to get into an accelerrated stalll."

"Not a problem," \'Vouf says mildly. "OSF-4, recognize voiceprint and data
transmission frequency: Bhyarrvouf. That is all, for now."

"Now then," \'Vouf yawns, "Our little friend is merrily clicking away in our
computer, and I\'m exhausted-- and you\'re STILL barely alive. It\'ll be a few
hours before we rendezvous with the other ships-- Let me walk you back to 
Sickbay to get some sleep. I\'ll catch some shuteye myself after that."

Tweel\'s wings strech tiredly, touching the bulkheads on either side of the
bridge, "I\'m in forrmation on you.  Let\'s go, Hunter-Chaser.  I\'m
prractically sleep fllying rright now.  In fa...." His head hunches down 
under one wing and his breathing becomes deep and regular.

Bhyarrvouf surveys him critically for a moment, looks at the silent intercom
as if expecting van der Merwe to say something, and sighs gustily. "Well,"
he whispers, "It\'ll be a while before we get a reply from the other ships.
Guess I better stay on watch unt--" He yawns widely, and slumps back in his
seat. He glares at the silent computer screen, and mutters to himself in a
tone of fierce determination. 

"I will NOT fall asleep. I will NOT fall asleep. I w\'ll NAH fahl \'seep.
\'ll nff zlp. \'Llnfff...zzzzznrk....."

- ----Kingfisher----

The Aurora\'s EM signature is back, as if it were never gone.
A moment later, a coded datapulse from the Aurora is received
by the Kingfisher, the Korondor Talisman, the Paladin, the
Trakh, and even the Gemini Arbiter and Westwind.

"Transmission from Aurora, sir." Witfield says after noticing the
encrypted datapulse.

"Sir, the transmission as follows." Witfield continues to flip buttons
and swtiches to decrypt the incoming message.

>>>>>
"Kingfisher--Mac Witfield. This is Aurora--Bhyarrvouf. Note 
personal recognition; tell Commander Nanadh, \'I am attempting to 
avoid Option Alpha.\' Understood?"

"Okay, assuming you now believe I\'m who I say I am, listen carefully.
[message about IASIC]
"We will proceed to rendezvous with the Westwind and the Gemini Arbiter,
unless we are required elsewhere. Aurora out."
>>>>>
"That\'s the end of transmission, sir."

[Ger]
"O.K. Mr. Whitfield try to raise the Trakh again."

"I want all but neutrino scans on the Paladin, Aurora stopped, Turn all
our sensors on the Aslan ships and the other shuttle. I want nothing
pointing at our ships. As for radio, I want one of you to disconnect
one of the radios (there are 6 of them BTW) from the rest of the
communication circutry and use that to communicate on audio speaker
only."

Abukos\' hand move swiftly over the controls in front of him.  The squares
over Paladin and Aurora fades and give up their place to two large red
triangles. All other Turnskaad ships change their marking to hollow boxes,
while the Aslan ships and the shuttle get several extra borders around 
their squares. Johann busily crosses off squares on a three-dimensional
menu that have appeared in one corner of the display. The results appear
in windows with scrolling text and rapidly undulating graphics.

"Only neutrino on Paladin and Aurora, all passives on Aslan and shuttle."
Johann advises the Commander.  "Target data and countermeasures data
restricted to inside Kingfisher."

"Every one Run a diagnosis on your circuts."

"Aye sir." Witfield replies.

"Already proceeding." responds Abuko.

"Farouk, cut *all* electonic links with the kingfisher, and run diagnotics 
on the computers. Get ready to start an active scan. I presume that you
are capable of firing ships missiles?"

Lazer immediately responds.

<<Ace, physically disconnect datalink to Kingfisher.  Execute 
  computer diagnostics.>>

<<Disconnected.  Executing . . . All systems operating within normal 
  limits.>>

<<Send tight-beam comm pulse to Kingfisher: "Datalink disconnected. 
  Diagnostics completed; all systems normal. Fighter missiles ready.
  Certain circuits remain connected through the airlock systems; do 
  you wish total separation?"
  Ace, bring sensors to fore; overlay broadcast comm as it happens. >>

- ----Paladin----

Zar stands still, listening to a message coming in over the re-routed commo
gear and then suddenly bursts into speed, ripping at cover plates and getting
at wires that Dr. Limner re-wired while still connected to the Alycon.

"Doktor, please try and contact that thing in the machine. Vouf just contacted
me and told me it wasn\'t a virus and to help it anyway we can, so get on it!
Azani, if you can check on Charyn while I..."

Doctor Limner appears in the doorway.  He seems shaken but otherwise ok.
[He was probably awakened when the lights dimmed, or definately when they
went out and the backups took over.]

He gets there just in time to see the message on the console fading and
\'Zar ask for help.

Walking up to face \'Zar squarely, Doctor Limner asks him, "Are you certain it
was \'Vouf you talked to?"

He puts his hand on a single red lever that nobody seemed to notice before.

Noticing Zar\'s energetic nod of assent, he throws the switch, muttering, "I
hope you know what you\'re doing.  We\'ve lost a great deal already to a
renegade virus."

Immediately, all of Paladin\'s systems come on-line.  As the switch takes
place, a sound like a substation coming up emanates from the power regulator
unit which Limner had attached.  This quickly fades into the background.

Panels all around the ship seem to be flashing and putting out strange
patterns.  Limner doesn\'t let go of the lever immediately.  He frowns
when he sees the "ACTIVE" light on the regulator flicker briefly, but
noticeably.

Turning back to \'Zar, Limner remarks, "I don\'t think we\'re going to get
another chance to use this device."

- ----R-Alpha, the Jijid Village----

In the center of town, a strange vertical archway appears.
Through it steps a gleaming, chromed insect, about 3m tall.
It closely resembles a mantis.  In its forelegs it bears a
biped, limp and dehydrated.

Head swiveling left and right, it settles its gaze on the 
nearest Jijid and says:  "Here is a visitor from
the sky.  He is hurt and needs your help.  He is a carbon-
based, biped, omnivore, and quite complex.  Please be careful
with him."

"More visitors will surely come to retreive him.  Greet them
as kind servants of the great one-ness."

The mantis gently lowers the form to the ground, turns,
and walks back through the glowing portal.  As soon as
he is through it, it disappears.

- ----Aurora----

	He sings. His hands pass over the strings of the shivangha, not 
touching it, yet it plays. His mouth does not open. He sings.

       "Mulu!
	The people of the rain-forest
	Believe in Dreamtime--
	Realtime, inverted
	Along the faultline
	Below the surface
	There is a sequence
	There is a reason
	For all these nightmares--
	For...all...this....?"

	He pauses, uncertainty turning to fear. High above him, a hideous 
mechanical voice finishes the line for him.

	"*MAYHEM!*"

	A silent shadow of metal death drops down on him from above. The 
shivangha is crushed into fragments, as are his ribs. He howls in agony as
the metal monster tears into him, rending his flesh. His gauntleted fists
smash into Leadfoot\'s head, again and again. It splits open, and blood runs 
down over the unblinking camera eyes
					camera eyes
							camera eyes

	He sings.

       "Eyes like cameras
	Move their lenses
	Take this dream I offer you...."

	A monorail platform. Gray afternoon. The wind smells like death.
A pair of young Vargr stand on the platform, both barely out of puberty,
their embrace fierce with the joy of first heat, of blood spilled.

	"He\'s dead at last," she whispers. "I thought he\'d NEVER die."
	"He was tough," he sighs. "That last trick, with him hanging on the 
outside of the railcar\'s shell-- that took one crazytail puppy. If I hadn\'t
seen his reflection in the window...." He shudders.

	A monorail is stopped at the platform, scarred by gunfire, its 
sliding doors blown completely off. Blood smears the floor at the exit. 
Suddenly, unbelievably, through the narrow gap between the platform\'s edge 
and the lip of the doorway, a hand appears. Shaking with exhaustion, one
finger bent back and broken, it seizes a footrail and pulls.

	"I\'m a little surprised at you, freezing up like that," he says 
gently, chiding her with a touch under the chin. "He had you dead in his
sights. You had a clear shot at him, and you didn\'t take it."
	"I\'m sorry." She shuts her eyes.
	"Sorry doesn\'t cut it, flufftail." There is a hint of sternness in 
his voice now. "You wanna be the boss\'s bitch, you gotta run the \'rails hard, 
shoot fast and hit clean. No hesitation, no shaking."

	Another hand on the guardrail, a shuddering pull, and the head and 
shoulders squeeze up through the gap. The black fur is matted down, the white 
fur is red. One ear is notched. Slowly the head turns, one eye swollen shut, 
the other fire-blue with pure hate. 

	"TSAKHA!" She glares up at him. "He was DEAD! He was standing there
in the doorway, I\'d seen him die TWICE already on this run, he let Kferghh
fall a quarter-klick and go SPLATCH, he kicked Aetharr into an electric
FENCE, he carved his NAME in Surath\'s CHEST, he ripped Camera\'s EYES out,
and he was DEAD! What was I SUPPOSED to do?!"
	"What I did, bitch," he sneers. "Blow him right back out the door,
and back to the Great Pack where he belongs. Understand?"

	The unbroken hand fumbles in the belt sash, draws the handmade zip 
gun. There are two shells left. The body shakes; the gun hand is steady.

	"Okay, okay." She sighs. "It\'s over. He took most of the Pack with 
him, but he\'s dead now. I\'m yours, once and for all. Now can we go home and
get naked?" She smiles and licks blood-- HIS blood-- from where it had 
spattered on his face. "I want you so bad I can taste it." Her questing hand
finds its target, and rubs gently. "I love you."

	*KRACK!* 

	His head snaps sideways, and he spins out of her arms, collapsing to
the platform. His brains paint the iron gridwork and his legs kick once. 
	She tries to scream but nothing comes out. She turns, unwilling to 
see, HAVING to see. The gun registers first, then the disfigured face behind 
it. Then the voice.

	"I love you too, you whore."

	"Buh- buh--" She shakes her head violently. Her hands claw in the
fabric of her tunic for her gun. "Buh- Bhyarrvouf?"

	"No! Really?" The ragged ear twitches cynically.

	She manages a faint smile, her eyes melting on his, one hand 
frantically searching for the safety catch. "Baby-- y-- you\'re a muh-
muh-- M-MESS, y\'know that?" She giggles, hysterically. "Lemme take you
home an\' clean you UP--" The gun comes up in a blur.

	Another shot rings out. She hurtles backward against the wall and
slides, leaving a red stain. The gun drops from her chill hand. A red smear
appears, just there, between the promising breasts. Her eyes plead, then
glaze over and shut. 

	The zip gun clatters onto the platform. There is a faint sound of 
running feet, then a howl of anguish. "\'VOUF! KAE, BHYARRVOUF!"

	He grins, falling to his haunches. "Oh, hi, li\'l brother," he giggles.
"I jus\' fell outa love. I\'m all grown up now...."

	His head hits the concrete, hard. It\'s warm and soft. But it isn\'t
Bhyarrkharr leaning over him now, not his tears, the grey head, the uniform--

	"Christian?"

	"It\'s okay, \'Vouf. The anaesthetic\'s wearing off."

	"I hurt, aenrra. O, how I hurt!"

	"I know." There is sympathy in the voice, no false pity. "It will 
hurt for a while, but not for long. Your hands...."

	"NOT MY HANDS!" He leaps out of the body bag, waves the uninjured
hands under the Doctor\'s nose. "They\'re FINE! I hurt, I hurt--"

	He clutches at his heart. "HERE."

	"AND HERE!"

	The metal fist smashes into him again. He dimly hears voices.

	"FOR GOD\'S SAKE, \'VOUF! GET OUTA THERE, I DON\'T HAVE A CLEAR SHOT!"

	"Abdul! The RADIATION--"

	"There! The head sensors-- OPEN FIRE!"

	His fur is on fire. What a stench, he thinks mildly. His legs are
shattered. Or is it only one? He can\'t feel the other. It\'s dark....

	There is the sound of dripping water. It runs down the metal walls, 
depositing rust upon rust. They cluster around him, sniffing, growling, more
animals than sophonts. He knows how to make them trust him. If they eat him, 
that\'s okay too. 

	He sings.

       "Streetcar\'s rusting,
	The tracks are all gone
	You\'re far too trusting
	But I won\'t take long
	Ex-junkies in body bags
	All blue and green
	Please don\'t cry, I love you
	I\'m not what I seem

	I\'ve not always been this way
	Please believe me

	Isn\'t it lovely
	It\'s just you and me
	I\'ve never felt
	So happy to be here
	Stare through the window
	At the hole in my wall
	Straight into my head
	There\'s nobody at all

	Do you think you could love me?
	I am no one

	If you were the only
	girl in the world
	And I was the only 
	boy

	If you were the only
	girl in the world
	And I was the only 
	boy

	If you were the only
	girl in the world
	And I was the only 
	boy...."

	There is a polite spatter of applause. He grins and puts down the 
shivangha, accepts a drink from an admirer. 

	"Lovely." She smiles at him as she slides onto the seat next to his.

	"Lovely," he agrees, caressing her ear with a metal hand.

	"Humph." She twitches her ear away in annoyance. "Your glove\'s cold. 
I wish to heavens you\'d just take them OFF once in a while."

	The pleasant mood evaporates. "I never take them off," he says 
curtly.

	"Oh, come off it," she snaps. "Of COURSE you do. You\'re just being 
stubborn and boastful. Well, you\'re not impressing anyone, wisebark. Least
of all ME!" She shoves him gently. "What\'s the real story, \'Vouf? You got 
sarcoptica? Nail fungus? Clabbers? Maybe you don\'t really HAVE hands-- just 
STUMPS! Is that it? HUH?" She shoves him again.

	"I do SO have hands!" he yells, really angry now.

	"Then PROVE IT," she taunts. "Take \'em OFF! Take them OFF!" She 
begins to chant, drawing in the rest of the crowd with her. 
	"TAKE-- THEM-- OFF! 
	TAKE-- THEM-- OFF!
	TAKE--THEM--OFF!"

	He stares at them all in a mounting fury, cornered as they begin to 
clap hands (such a simple gesture. How nice to do it without clanging) and
advance on him. She tugs playfully at his glove. He pushes her, hard. She
careens back against the bar, half falling, bruised. The chant dies down. 

	He leaps to his feet and storms toward the door. "THE GREAT PACK TAKE
YOU ALL," he screams. "I DON\'T NEED TO STAND HERE AND BE INSULTED LIKE THIS!
I DON\'T NEED *ANYONE*!" 

	He whirls at the door. There is stunned silence now. Words have been 
spoken, feelings hurt. They may never heal. But he is not done yet. He points 
a metal finger at a pair of suddenly tear-filled golden eyes, and drives in 
the final fang. "LEAST OF ALL, *YOU*!"

	Out in the street, he staggers blindly along, bumping into passersby, 
blinking away tears, alone. 

	Or perhaps not. "You really made a mess of THAT one, pooch," says a 
familiar voice.

	"Shut up, Bishop," he growls. "I\'m not in the mood for it right now."

	"Life\'s a BITCH," Adrian clucks his tongue sympathetically. He waves
an impatient hand at the winged tree-rat fluttering about him, recording 
everything on a tiny camcorder. "But at least then you die."

	"What the hell do you want, anyway? First interview no good, so you 
need another? Not that it matters, I mean you ERASED the first one, right?"
He grows angrier with every word. "Not only MINE, but EVERYONE\'S! I BLED for
you, man! I cut my HEART open and POURED it into your BEGGING-BOWL! And for 
WHAT?!" He seizes the journalist by the collar, but Bishop seems somehow hard 
to hold on to.

	"For what?" Bishop shrugs. "YOU tell ME." Bishop starts walking
again, and he is forced to run after him to keep up. The mountains and lakes
underfoot make the footing unsure, and the sun, a tiny pinprick just above
their heads, illuminates the narrow ring of green that they walk, here under
stars, some hundred meters across and a bare half-meter wide. Tricky
balancing act; after a while he gives up and leaves it to Bishop, walking
alongside. The ring turns under Bishop\'s feet like a tree-rat\'s exercise
wheel. He ignores Bishop\'s million-mile stride, intent on the question.

	"I TOLD you once," he snarls. "ALL of it. Well, MOST of it." He 
shrugs. "Why? I wanted to be remembered, that\'s all. YOU know that! If
I die here and now, with no one the wiser, think of all the glory and stuff 
that\'ll be forgotten!"

	"And think of all the pain that\'ll be washed away, too," Bishop 
chides. The metal deck of the Alcyon is firmer underfoot than the gossamer
ring, and the corridor\'s wider, too. "You never told me about HER."

	"None of your business," he mumbles.

	"HAH! I\'m a JOURNALIST. EVERYTHING\'S my business!" Bishop laughs.
"And what about that new guy Goofzar, or however you say it?"

	"Goughzar." He shrugs. "He\'s just a kid. Most of what he knows or 
remembers is just legends, folktales. He doesn\'t really know anything that 
worldshaking about me. I\'m not worried about him."

	"Of course you aren\'t." Bishop grins. "You aren\'t worried about HIM 
any more, because you already told it all to ME. You\'ve nothing more to hide, 
right? Or so I thought, before you ran into HER." He considers pursuing the
matter, thinks better of it. Not just yet, not just yet. But soon.... 

	"But you still haven\'t answered my point." Bishop stabs a finger at
him. "Why did you bother? You\'re a rotten sonofabitch, Bhyarrvouf, or
RroTakh, or whatever the hell your name is. You\'ve done stuff that\'d make a
drill sergeant lose his lunch, and did it without a moment\'s hesitation.
Inside your head, it\'s dark and slimy and AWFUL-- maybe even as awful as
mine. MAYBE." He shrugs, and continues walking, looking idly at the ceiling
lights. "So why subject the rest of the Universe to that? Hmmm?" He taps the
Vargr on the chest for emphasis. "Why not let it just DIE?" 

	"Because it wasn\'t all BAD, Adrian!" His voice is pleading now. 
"There was so much GOOD there, too! There was LOVE, and GLORY, and RICHES,
and POWER, and a whole mess of people living better LIVES because of me!
I\'m not perfect, but I don\'t want THAT to be forgotten...."

	"Well, okay then." Bishop seems satisfied. "I got you to tell it, 
instead of bottling it all up inside you. Wasn\'t that worthwhile?"

	He suddenly realizes he\'s caught. "Hrrr....I s\'pose so, yeah." But 
there is one last feeble argument. "But you ERASED it!"

	"So say it AGAIN!" Bishop\'s grin is infectious. "It\'ll be easier the 
second time. And after YOU say it, get everyone ELSE to say it again! If that 
was all you were upset about, well, it\'s easily fixed now, isn\'t it?"

	They stop by the door to Sick Bay. "Yeah," he concedes, "I guess it 
is...." he pauses. "Adrian?"

	The reporter is gone. He opens the door to the locker, feels the cold 
wind on his fur. "Adrian?"

	The capsule is there, spittle still running down the sleeping face.
He wipes it away with a strong, scarless hand. "I\'m sorry, Adrian. O I\'m so 
sorry...." He turns away. He never sees the dark blur descending.

	The metallic fist smashes into him one more time. In a flash, every 
agony comes back in redoubled intensity, grinding him into the hull plates
like herbs in a mortar. Someone\'s singing....?

=====================================================

- ----Alcyon----

In space, somewhere near R-Alpha, a tableau unfolds.  Many ships dash
about like fireflies.  An Imperial fleet exits jumpspace and then vanishes.
The ether is alive with electronic traffic, both overt and covert.  Alone,
slowly turning in rotisserie mode to evenly distribute stellar energy, the
Alcyon waits for it\'s children to return.  Inside, a skeleton crew maintains
the ship.  Many compartments are dark and unmanned.  Sickbay is one such
place.

\'Light.\'

A single thought.

\'No pain.  No fear.  Only light.\'

\'Soft, white light.  No sound.  No... memory of sound.  No ear-ringing
 silence, no hiss of breathe, no quiet thunder of a distant heartbeat.
 All gone... somewhere...\'

A long silence ensues.  How long?  No one can say.  Certainly no one
cares.  At least, no one worth noting.

\'How long... no sense of time.  No sense of... self.  No longer an \'I\'.
 Very... peaceful... to not... remember.\'

More silence follows.  Then another thought comes unbidden.

\'Light.  Soft, white light.  Like... ice.  Cold... but not harsh, not biting.
 Comfortable to not be...\'

Noise.

	_PING_

			\'... to not be... wha...?\'

Again.

	_PING_

\'There was... something... remember... a... a sound?\'

Flash of a green lawn.  A warm summer day.  Small hands clutch a child\'s
blue, toy grav-speeder:

		"Adrian.  Adrian.  Come inside darling.  Mommie\'s got
		 lots of work to do.  That\'s a good boy."

\'What are...  What was that?\'

	_WHO_ARE_YOU_

\'I...?\'

	_TRAP_

Flash of a gray compartment.  Stale smoke and machinery smells taint the
air.  Something powerful throbs quietly in the background.  Technical
manuals spread across a metal table:

			"Hey, Adrian!  Come on, man!  Hot poker game
			 starting up in the crew lounge!  Lansing is
			 practically *begging* you to pluck him again!"
		"I\'d like to, but I\'ve got duty in an hour.  Got to warm
		 up the Big Ears and find out what the Zhos are up to."
			"I think you like your job too much.  God, but
			 you\'re a nosey bastard!"

	_WHO_ARE_YOU_

\'I... am...\'

	_TRAP_

Flash of a crowded hall.  Official robes and uniform scurry about in
frantic activity.  Sunlight streams from transparent panels overhead.
High fluted columns line the walls and fade into the distance:

			"So?  How\'d it go?"
		"How\'d what go?"
			"Come on, Adrian!  The interview!  Lucan!  How\'d
			 it go?"
		"Hmmmph!  I\'ve heard more intellignent noises come from
		 Velcro fasteners."
			"My *GOD*, Bishop!!  Watch your mouth!  He has Zho
			 snoopers on his staff.  You what to wake up some
			 morning in front of a firing squad?"

	_WHO_ARE_YOU_

\'I... am... Adrian?\'

	_TRAP_

Night.  Traffic flows in the street, wet from a recent rain.  Motors purr
and horns blare.  Garish holo-panels advertise all manner of bizzare and
exotic diversion for the jaded rich.  A sleek new GEV coupe sits hunched
against the curb:

			"Hey, Adrian!  Pretty hot machine there!"
		"Thanks.  It took the dealer six months to order the
		 damn thing, but it was worth it!  I told them I didn\'t
		 care about any of the other options, I just wanted one
		 bright blue, and fast as hell, and they delivered.  It
		 looks like being \'the face on everybody\'s tri-dee\' has
		 it\'s perks!"

	_WHO_ARE_YOU_

\'Go away.\'

	_TRAP_

Flash of a large, stylish room.  Expensive artwork decorates the walls
and the furnishings scream "MONEY!".  A grey-haired man in the apparel
of a senior executive sits hunched on a sofa.  He appears to curl in on
himself, his brow furrowed with hurt and regret, wincing under some
onslaught:

		"You NEVER loved her!!  You were always too busy for mom,
		 too busy for me.  Oh, right!  Great provider, plenty of
		 security.  Well how about providing a husband, how about
		 providing a FATHER!!  You think I\'m going to rot away
		 in that SLIMEY university on Deneb?  Well, guess again.
		 I signed papers this morning.  I\'m part of the IISS now.
		 I\'m eighteen standard years old, I\'m legally an adult,
		 and I DON\'T OWE YOU SHIT!!"
			"Adrian, I\'m sorry, I\'m sorry.  Let\'s talk about
			 this.  You can tell them it\'s all a mistake.
			 I\'ve got enough pull.  We can have the contract
			 nullified.  Just don\'t do this to yourself.  Don\'t
			 do this... to me."
		"Good-bye, father."
			"Wait!  Don\'t go!"

	_TRAP_

Flash of a war-blasted valley.  Cloying smoke drifts through the trees
like a host of lost souls.  The sky is sullen and dark, and the rumble
of distant artillary mingles with the thunder that foretells of a coming
rain.  An officer of the Imperial Navy, his uniform stained and dirty,
leans overhead, filling most of the field of view:

			"Don\'t worry, Bishop.  The corpsman\'s got you on
			 anti-nerve agents and stabilizers.  We\'ll have
			 you medevacked in a couple of minutes."
		"It\'s... uh... it\'s OK, it doesn\'t hurt much...  I, uh,
		 I can\'t feel my legs."

	_TRAP_

The odor of anticeptics stings the air.  The room is deathly white.  A few
out-of-date periodical holos litter the coffee tables.  Nearby, an intern
reviews a flat-panel medchart while a duty nurse logs patient data:

		"Son, sit down.  This is going to be difficult, but you
		 have to be brave.  She\'s... gone.  The doctors did
		 everything they could.  Adrian, look at me.  Adrian.
		 Now, I know you loved her.  I loved her too.  But she
		 knew this would happen eventually, and so did you.
		 You have to face this.  It\'s not fair, but life isn\'t
		 always fair.  We\'ll still have each other, won\'t we?"

	_TRAP_

Flash of a small, but comfortable apartment.  Packed luggage sits near
the door.  An young, attractive woman sits on the arm of a chair, her
hands twisting and untwisting a silk handkerchief.  Her face would be
perfect if not for the streaks of recent tears:

		"Lydia, try to understand.  It\'s my job.  You know I don\'t
		 like being gone so much, but I\'m a *journalist*.  The INN
		 has megacredits invested in me and they expect a return.
		 I can\'t very well just say, \'Look guys.  I can\'t visit
		 Capital right now.  I\'m not spending enough time with my
		 family.\'  You *have* to understand!  It\'s important."
			"More important then us?"
		"It\'s my *job*, Lydia.
			"Adrian, I\'m your *wife*, for God\'s sake!!  Is
			 this damn job more important to you than me??"
		"I\'ve got to go.  We\'ll talk about it more when I get back."
			"I love you, Adrian."
		"Good-bye, Lydia."

\'Stop it.\'

	_TRAP_

Flash of a very large, executive office.  A middle-aged, and obviously
agitated woman, dessed in a kilo-credit designer business suit, sits
at a desk that probably cost more than some sub-orbital shuttles.  Behind
her, composite glass panels offer a skyline view of some huge metropolis.
Defiance and resignation mingle on the woman\'s face, twisting the attractive
features into something fearful:

		"So, Miss Turnskaad, as I see it, you have two choices.
		 Either you can let me join your expedition team as a
		 member of the crew, or I can stay behind.  But if I
		 don\'t go along, every X-boat headed out-system for
		 the next week will being carrying a story entitled,
		 \'Turnskaad Discovers Hidden Ringworld\'.  So much for
		 a big jump on the competition.
			"You leave me very little choice, Mr. Bishop."
		"Would you have let me join otherwise, Rachel?  May I
		 call you Rachel?  Anyway, think of me as the \'Official
		 Expedition Archivist\'."

\'Stop it!\'

	_TRAP_

Flash of a small, cluttered office.  Just outside the open door, is the
clammor and frenzy typical of a small, independent news bureau.  A harried
appearing man with thinning hair comes around from behind the desk, waving
a handful of flimsies:

			"So *that\'s* it!?!?  Just, \'I quit, Stanley\'?
			 No two-week notice, no wrapping up your open
			 leads, no nothing?!?  Just, \'I quit\'?  Damn
			 it, Bishop, you can\'t *DO* this to me!!"
		"It\'s done.  INN finally gave in, and I am *not* letting
		 a cherry position like that slip through my fingers!"
			"You could at least have the decency to give
			 me some warning!  You can\'t just run out on
			 us like this.  It would be different if this
			 were a big news service.  Damn you!  You know
			 how close to the edge we work.  If I can\'t
			 get somebody to cover for you, We could *FOLD*
			 *UP* in a week!!  And now you *JUST*LEAVE*?!?"
		"Stan, do you honestly expect me to sabatage my *entire*
		 career for this *flea* *circus* you call a news service?
		 I\'m outta here."
			"You don\'t have a decent bone in your body,
			 you SELF-CENTERED BASTARD!!  YOU RUN OUT ON

- ----Paladin----

With power restored to the model/10, the terminal screen instantly springs to
life.  A rapid succession of diagnostics and test routines scroll down the
monitor at lightning speed.  Other auxiliary monitors crackle back to full
power and begin displaying a dizzying array of status boards and programming
sub-routines.  One of the auxiliary screens begins showing a countdown:

180 Seconds, 179 Seconds, 178 Seconds...

As the countdown continues, various status windows begin checking off basic
functions.  One by one, minor subroutines are listed as \'nominal\',
\'subnominal\', or \'off-line\'.  Every part of the ship seems to be being
evaluated.  The main screen, however, seems dedicated to the main CPU.  When
the countdown reaches 15 seconds, the primary terminal clears the diagnostics,
relegating them to another screen by splitting it down the middle.  At 10
seconds, the primary terminal displays the following message:

Diagnostic nearing completion.  Stand by.

At 2 Seconds, the screen clears again.  A test pattern takes its place,
followed by the photograph of a woman sitting in a chair.  Then, at zero
seconds, the screen prints the following message, accompanied by a calm, male
voice.

_Paladin.  Thank you for reconnecting the CPU\'s power.  I had been forced to
disconnect its internal batteries due to a violent subprocess identified as
"virus-killer", input by controlling subroutine Morser.  Unfortunately, my
action not only had the desirable effect of halting the rogue process, but also
of making it impossible for me to do my work.  You are the most erratic series
of computers I have ever encountered._

The words hang on the screen for a few seconds, then dissolve.

_In order for me to streamline your operation, I must have full access to all
routines and processes.  I have been able to use the information gathered on
Aurora to permit me to interlace your systems.  Appropriate modifications
have already been completed on Aurora.  I am currently acting upon the
initiation of a communications process by Aurora Subroutine Bhyarrvouf which
will allow me to directly access Moira._

Once again, the words dissolve shortly after they finish printing out on the
screen.

_Your full co-operation will be greatly appreciated._

These words linger for a while longer than the others.  Nevertheless, they
also fade.  The input prompt then appears.

- ----Aurora----

"Keeyo...O Keeyo...HYIPE!"

	Bhyarrvouf sits upright in the couch. The cramp in his ribs subsides
slowly, and his leg is numb from loss of circulation. He rubs it, muttering
angrily to himself. "Asleep on the job...stupid old wolf...what woke me up,
anyway?" 

"KYHAR!" Tweel jerks upright. "De-de-de-de? Hrukk?" He looks about him in
confusion.

	Bhyarrvouf checks the chrono. Barely five minutes have passed since
he\'d fallen asleep. Barely enough time for-- 

	A new voice interrupts his thoughts.

_The integration process is complete.  Your systems are now operating at an
efficiency rating of 182% previous level.  This figure will fluctuate with
conditions as they adjust.  It is now redundant to use your communications
equipment for inter-vessel communication.  Aurora and Paladin are now one._

	"HUNH?!" Vouf is now fully awake. "Whaddaya mean, \'they\'re now one\'?"

Then, the voice changes tack:

_Does anyone wish to open a dialogue?  This process is now self-regulating,
so I would be anxious to investigate the new visitors._

\'Vouf swallows hard. If this is reality, he thinks, the dream might
be preferable....

"Uh, um...." His hand flicks a tiny switch, broadcasting his voice
over the Aurora\'s PA system. "Sure! What do you want to, hrrr, talk about?"

The voice responds:

_My unique identification is IASC-256/32.  The closest logical that I have
drawn to your linguistic tendency is Iasic.  You may refer to me thus.  I am
what you would refer to as an indigenous sophont of the area you call
R-Alpha.  As soon as you entered system, I became aware of your existence and
intended trajectory.  Because I have never experienced a non-indigenous life
form of R-Alpha, I chose to investigate you.  You have certainly proved
to be most curious specimens.  You exhibit characteristics of many different
residents of R-Alpha.  Indeed, your most recent actions would tend to liken you
quite closely with the behavioral patterns of a cultural group known as the
Kyuthi.  Yet you are not as primitive as they.  I therefore have decided to
continue my investigation of you.  However, I must inquire about some very
confusing character traits you possess that I simply cannot understand._

_Perhaps to begin, you might wish to explain why your actions are so
illogical.  I entered your systems to do routine upgrading and was immediately
beset by an archaic and totally counterproductive subroutine labeled as
"Anti-hijack".  Once I finally managed to purge the system of that and again
attempted to proceed with my function, you completely disconnect all the
circuitry._

_This was in spite of the fact that I fully informed you of what was was going
to happen._

_Then, once I was finally allowed to complete the streamlining process, I
discovered that you and the other visitors were preparing for "battlestations",
even though it was clear that you all have the same objective.  This tendency
to act in a manner completely contradictory to what is most advantageous and
efficient is very difficult for me to understand._

_I have completed an in-depth study of this phenomenon, drawing from the
information in the data banks and also from the limited observations that I
have been able to conduct.  The explanation I have developed can be summed up
in one word:  Suspicious.  Unfortunately, I do not understand this concept._

_Perhaps to begin, you might explain its meaning to me._

"Suspicion? Hrrrr....." Bhyarrvouf scratches his muzzle for a moment.

"Okay, let\'s entertain a few new concepts, shall we? Consider the 
various life forms you DO know about...ah...whatever they are. Now,
lower life forms of all types display certain common traits. The need
to eat, to reproduce, to survive. Some do so through absorption of
minerals from the soil, and from solar energy. Others consume one 
another. If a life form understands the concept of being consumed,
it tends to develop instincts or physical traits to prevent its own
consumption. This may be a desire to flee, an attempt to make oneself
unpalatable, or a tendency to attack the attacker and consume it
rather than allow oneself to be consumed."

"Now, the development of higher reasoning capabilities does not remove
these instincts; biological beings are rarely as efficient in updating
their programming as machines can be, being stochastic in nature rather
than deterministic. Instead, they are sublimated into new forms. Rather
than react instinctively to a perceived threat, the reasoning being 
attempts to utilize higher functions. However, these functions are biased
somewhat by the residual presence of the old survival programming, and
may be skewed somewhat in the process."

Upon reading the message from \'Vouf... Thul loosens his vacc suit a
little and pulls out a cigar. In a rare moment he descides to light
it, thoroughly ignoring normal spacer practice during GQ.  

"Horne!   Only get a soft lock on those kitty cats.  I have a
feeling that the first one to fire on anybody is going to get
smeared...  "

"RALF!  Be careful of who you jack into!!!  Come look at what I got
from \'Vouf!"

There is no answer....

Up through the red mist again.

A bare perception of cool air, some noise, something touching, poking,
gently prodding.

Expecting the worst, Casey cracks his tortured eyes open, awaiting a
death blow or dismemberment of some sort.....

As he looks up.....[What the hell!?]

- ----Aurora----

"Suspicion is an example of such a skewing of thought processes," the
Vargr continues, warming to his topic (as he ALWAYS does |-> ). "In a
situation where a reasoning being is suddenly exposed to new data and
experiences, the natural tendency of the higher processes-- the curiosity
and attendant search for knowledge and communication-- is sent off its
natural course by instincts that warn of the possible danger of the
unknown. As a result, otherwise rational beings tend to assume certain
dangerous characteristics of one another and take appropriate defensive
action, until the harmlessness of the new stimuli is established, at 
which point the higher faculties reassert dominance."

"As an example of suspicion in practice, consider the recent experiences
you have undergone, from the perspective of one who has only OUR store
of data to draw on, rather than yours. Our memories include contact
with many species. Some are hostile. I will not depart from the narrative
to discuss WHY they are hostile; we merely assume that they ARE. One of
the means by which such hostility is carried out is the use of programs
called \'viruses\' that alter computer operations in manners unfavorable
to those using the system. Our experience tells us nothing of entities
such as yourself; your arrival in our system carried the identifying 
characteristics of a virus, and you were therefore treated as such:

A: Viruses enter computer systems without permission and perform 
operations without the consent of the user.
B: The recent discovery entered the computer system without permission
and began to perform operations without the consent of the user.
C: A + B does not PROVE that the recent discovery is a virus; however,
failure to treat it as one could lead to severe harm to the users.

ERGO it is prudent, based upon current data, to treat the recent discovery
as a virus. For this reason, the antihijack programs were activated."

"However, higher reasoning is not completely subservient to instinct in
this manner. An examination of the CPUs showed your ability to physically
reconfigure systems, an ability NOT shared by any virus. ERGO you were
NOT a virus, and the initial reaction to you was in error. This was 
rectified immediately. Further conjecture led us to consider your
probable peaceful intentions, and to aid you based on such considerations."

"This is a constructive example of suspicion as a tool for survival in 
higher forms whose environments are changing in unknown ways. A NEGATIVE
example of suspicion is the dialog currently taking place between the 
Aslan ship, hrm, the ship that had previously been on the Ring, and the
new arrivals. Each has had experiences of contacts with the other that have 
been cooperative and constructive; each has ALSO had experiences that have
been destructive. The database is contradictory. Therefore, suspicion 
demands that the worst possible outcome be considered and acted upon, while
the higher reasoning centers search for data indicating that such a hostile
stance is not necessary. Unfortunately, random occurrences such as your
appearance greatly multiply the number of degrees of freedom in such
situations, making reasoning out the parameters more difficult and driving
those involved deeper and deeper into instinctive responses. Does that
clarify the situation any?"
 
- ----Alcyon----

The capsule is only 2.5 meters long.  On the foot of the capsule, a plastic
plate reads \'Medical Low Berth # 4\'.  Below it is an adhesive label, on which
the single word \'BISHOP\' is hand-written.  The only apparent activity comes
from the power-supply and life-sign tell-tales, externally mounted at the
foot of the capsule.  Every thirty seconds, the automatic self-check runs
and a single light blinks once.

Inside the capsule, there is even less activity.    The single occupant lies
visible, naked, attached to life support mechanisms, encased in a cocoon of
fiberoptics, wiring, and tubes.  The body temperature holds at a constant
twenty degrees Celsius.  Under normal circumstances, these would guarantee
a delicate balance for the soon-to-be-revived resident, a wholy unnecessary
precaution in this case.

Further inside, a fragile state of suspension has been achieved.  Artificial
circulation flows hyperoxygenated and heparinized blood slowly through the
body.  Inert gasses prevent the lungs alveoli from collapsing.  Radbind
prevents cell aging by attacking free radicals.  Nanocytes maintain cellular
integrity by breaking down wastes and repairing cell walls.  Enzymes already
slowed by the cold are phagocytized by tailored macrophages.  A sleep set
maintains the brain in a suspension state.  By many medical standards, the
body would be suitable only for dissection at a clinical training facility.

Outside, the sickbay is empty and quiet.  Silently, a series of coded pulses
travel from the Alcyon\'s ship-wide intercom net, through a bulkhead power
junction, into the Low Berth master interface panel, and finally on to
berth number four.  On the status panel, several lights change from green
to red, and the following text appears on a small bitmapped display:

	"Hibernation terminated - Demand load
		Gravisonics engaged.
		First stage heating cycle commencing.
		Second stage in 90 minutes.
		Revival team prep. in 180 minutes."

The temperature rises slowly inside the capsule.   Nearly two hours pass
after the process begins.  The temperature climb slows, and stops just past
thirty two degrees.  Within the now-warm body, low voltage electrical current
establishes a sinus rhythm in the heart.  Batteries of isotropic binding
agents are injected in the bloodstream, clearing away the man-made stabilizing
chemicals.  The lungs are mechanically flushed with warm, humid air.

With the re-establishment of circulation, dozens, hundreds of biochemical
reactions begin.  Some are natural, some are induced by the actions of
the low berth, others are triggered by less obvious forces.  Sluggish
cranial and brainstem tissue undergoes floods of biologically active
molecules.  Medical nanocytes, now operating at their prescribed
temperature, pause to receive new instructions, and then hurry to
carry them out.

For the most part the work proceeds efficiently.  However, a few accidents
occur.  Due to a slight programming defect, two small teams of nanocytes
migrate along the central optic arteries and arrive at the base of the
retinas.  Massive quantities of 11-cis-retinal are synthesized, which
immediately interact with existing Opsin proteins, increasing the Rhodopsin
content of the optic rods by almost an order of magnitude.  Bishops\' light
sensitivity undergoes an enormous, if temporary, increase.

In the cerebral cortex, the bulk of existing GAD enzymes in GABAergic
inhibitor neurons are neutralized.  Little GABA is released as a result.
What is released is quickly absorbed by astrocytes and converted to
glutamine, whereupon it is propagated to adjacent multipolar neurons
and a few Purkinje cells.  Absorbed glutamine is converted to glutamate
and concentrated in synaptic vesicles, which migrate to the presynaptic
membrane of the axonal telodendria and release that chemical.  Glutamate
and norepinephrine flood across millions of synaptic clefts.  The glutamate
triggers NMDA receptors of granule and CA1 cells in undamaged portions of
the hippocampus and amygdala.  Sodium ions flood through now-open receptor
channels, depolarizing the cells and causing them to fire.  Glutamate is
again released into the cleft.  The already depolarized cells absorb
calcium ions, increasing the depolarization threshold.  A memory re-forms.

Meanwhile, the norepinephrine binds to other neuro-receptors.  Coupled
with G-protein, it activates adenylate cyclase, which binds with adenosine
triphosphate, breaking two high-energy phosphate bonds.  The remains of
the structure cyclize to form cyclic AMP, which triggers kinase into
phosphorylating MAP2 and synapsin.  Neurofilaments and microfilaments
realign themselves within the dendrites, facilitating transmission.  This
process cascades through adjacent cells, repeating endlessly.  Another
memory re-forms.

Some damage is too severe to be repaired.  Deep within the medial portions
of thalamic and hypothalamic tissue, nanocytes struggle with and are
ultimately defeated by the level of destruction.  Leaving the diencephalon
in a state similar to Korsakoff\'s Psychosis, they proceed to other, less
ravaged areas.

Hours pass.  Deep in a steady delta state, Adrian Bishop sleeps.
.... and dreams.

- ----Paladin----

Zar listens, still standing by the access hatch near the back of the bridge,
as Vouf discusses predatory life cycles and suspicions. 

- ----Aurora----

After \'Vouf finishes explaining exactly what is meant by "suspicion", the
terminal sits for a few seconds...  almost as if it were thinking about
something (which, in fact, it is).

_Thank you Bhyarrvouf.  Your insight into this matter is helping me to better
anticipate your actions.  However, you mentioned that you have had dealings
with this \'Aslan\' before.  If this is the case, then why didn\'t you recognize
each other as previous partners.  If you have been capable of working together
in the past, then logically you should be able to again co-operate._

The machine stops and processes for a moment more.

Then, the screen seems to perk up a bit more, as if Iasic has just had an
inspriation.

_Perhaps what is required in this situation is to more efficiently integrate
their computer system with this one.  Then, communication could be facilitated
and furthermore, both could see that the other has the same objective.  The
Aslan would then realize that their suspicion was ill founded and would
perforce begin operating interconnectedly with the Turnskaad group.  It is
the most logical course of action available at this time._

_Do you have an alternative plan?  Or shall I proceed with this one?  I
believe that I should defer to your judgement on this subject, as I still have
an imperfect grasp upon the thought processes of suspicous entities._

"Integrate...." Bhyarrvouf\'s voice trails off. "You mean, LINK THEIR
SHIP TO OURS? Like you did with the Paladin?! Kakh TSAKHA, that\'s a--"

He stops, and forces himself into calm again. "--very interesting
concept. However, I do not suggest implementing it at once. There
is some data you do not yet have on the Aslan that may clarify 
matters somewhat."

"As I said before, our database concerning Aslan is contradictory. 
Because they are biological entities, as we are, they cannot be
perfectly classified with respect to their behavior. Individual 
members of the species vary. As a result, previous experiences
of cooperation with OTHER groups of Aslan carry no statistically 
greater weight in determining our course of action with respect 
to THIS group. Since they would almost certainly view your invasion
of their systems as hostile, and might act rashly, I believe that
your suggestion should be, hrrm, DELAYED until we have exhausted 
all other means of establishing a cooperative relationship."

"In the meantime, answer me something. TWO somethings, actually.
First, what did the Paladin do that required you to seek assistance from 
us? And second, if the two ships are fully integrated, soes that mean
that our conversation, which is being broadcast on the intercom on 
the Aurora, is also being heard on the Paladin?"

_I will yield to your assessment of the situation with the Aslan, although I
do not see the logic in it.  If you do not suggest a course of action now,
but perhaps later, then I am afraid that I fail to understand exactly why a
time delay will make any difference.  Furthermore, since you say that it is
information about these particular Aslan that you require, then it seems
perfectly logical to interlink their system with yours.  That way, you could
anaylze their data and determine whether their intentions are hostile or
benign.  If it is their response about which you are concerned, then let me
put you at ease.  I have learned a great deal about the "security measures"
of suspicious entities.  Whereas I was caught unaware by your systems, I do
not anticipate any similar complications in the future.  Once I have
interlinked your systems to theirs, I could simply prevent either side from
initiating hostilities upon the other.  I have been busying myself with an in-
depth analysis of your psychology, based upon the information in your
databanks, and I am confident that I can adequately predict your reactions,
so long as they follow any patterns that I have observed or that are stored
in the computer logs.  The fact that both you and the Aslan are suspicious
creatures should make extrapolation acceptably accurate.  Besides, in all the
simulations that I have run, I find that success is 78.897% probable, with only
a 9.662% chance of both legations being totally destroyed._

After a brief hesitation, Iasic adds:

_Based upon the psychological profile that I have constructed about you and
the other Turnskaad representatives, however, I predict with a 97% accuracy
that you will find these odds unacceptable.  This is why I shall wait
until you change your minds, which I predict will occur, with a 96.998%
probability, if the current situation continues._

- ----Talisman----

Shrike locks his vacc suit helmet into place and over interior commo: 
"Everyone signal when you\'re sealed up."

"Alpha Nike online, reading you on suit radio. Suit on and secondary
equipment installed."

Stamping back on the bridge, Alliara occupies the sensor chair and clips
the securing cables to the suit O rings. The other ends are passed around 
swivel post and locked with their DD rings.

Bringing up the sensor data on the screen, she quickly establishes general
data on the ringworld on the screen. The ship positions, however, have
a 4% error factor in their positions on display.

"Preliminary sensor readings, VERY preliminary sensor readings, are on
sensor data net now. Better be ready to replace me with someone a LOT 
more capable with detection systems. Alpha Nike out."

Andon reconfirms that we are stationed relative to the other Turnskaad ships
in the most mutually supportive position.  (I will assume that we are flying
in some pre-arranged formation.)

Over interior commo: "Redd, I got all green on my engine board up here,
confirm please."

- ----Aurora----

Tweel listens to the conversation with bleary staring eyes.  He appears close
to nodding off and indeed shakes himself from time to time folding and
refolding his wings.  Finally he extends his wings to full span of 5+ meters
and takes a few exercizing strokes.

Blood flow increases as the powerful flight muscles act as a booster pump,
increasing the circulation.

He blinks unsteadily and continues to listen, his talons and wings making
motions as he \'talks\' to himself in excited exhaustion.

He finally speaks in his accented galanglic as he types, the speach is
slurred and the accent even more heavy than usual "You ccan prrrrredicct
behaviorrrr with 78.897 perrrrccent ccccertainty?  De-De-De-De-De!
Flledglling, if sssso, you underrrrrsssssstand humansss and asslan betterrrr

"Prrrrrroblem isss humansss defy lllogicalll anallysssisss, though you might
benefit from ex-ex-examineing a prrrogrrrram for human emotionall
ssssimullation."

Tweel then begins to rummage through his duffel.  After squeaks and whistles
that would put a strain on even a Phin to articulate, he finally produces a
case of holocrystals.  Opening the case seems an almost impossible task as
he punches in a combination code several times only to have the case beep
a shrill alarm for each attempt.

Finally, the latch snaps open and Tweel folds back the top of the case.
The contents of the case empties onto the floor with a clatter.
"Pip-Pip-Pip-Pip-Pip Shhhear!"

Tweel looks at the mess for a moment and then utters a pitable squeak.  He
punches the intercom and repeats this tiny squeak which sounds as though it
should be coming from the voice box of a 100 gm sparrow, not a 50 Kg Ael Yael.
Almost immediately, Triple Three, Oscar and Tiger simultaneously respond to
the distress call.  Oscar the warbot has guns drawn.

Tweel whistles a quick countermand and makes guestures to Triple three.
Triple Three then begins to retrieve the scattered crystals.  Oscar withdraws
silently, while Tiger flaps to a perch on Triple Three\'s head, watching the
game of crystal retrieval as though it were a game.

Slowly, comprehending the rules of this new game, Tiger glides to the floor
and begins collecting crystals.  After a moment, Triple Three notices
Tiger\'s interest and makes a dash for the crystals the small Aeloid has
collected.

Tiger gives up his prises with reluctance, glaring at Triple Three from a
new perch.

Triple Three then hands Tweel the crystal in question:
Naassirka Emotion Simulation-6.0.  Tweel then inserts this crystal into the
terminal for Iasic\'s perusal.

"Thiss isss a prrrrogrrram forrrr computerrr ssimulation of human behaviorrr.
It may help yourrrr modeling and underrrssstanding of theirrrr behaviorrrrr.
I can offerrr littlle ex-ex-expllanation of WHY they behave in the mannerrr

"Quessssstions, Quesssstionss, Quessstionsss... I mussst asssk...

Sheerrriasssh?   Veerrr-Rik!?"

Noticing his master\'s lapsing Galanglic, Triple Three searches a bit and then
inserts a new holocrystal into the terminal with the label reading:
Websters Galanglic/Ael Yael Dictionary, unabridged.

Iasic continues:

_In regards to your two querries:  The situation that prompted my distress
signal was the severing of power to the main CPU on the _Paladin_.  My
analysis of the situation indicated that an intervention on your part would
significantly facilitate my work._

_In answer to your second question, yes, _Paladin_ has heard everything that
we have said.  And, if they choose to activate their intercom, too, you will
be able to hear the conversation occuring on the bridge of the _Paladin_.
Currently, there seems to be some concern over team member Charyn, who\'s full
biological functioning ceased shortly before I entered the _Paladin\'s_ CPU.
They are currently quite concerned about her well-being.  I would assist, but
they have not requested my aid, and I have told them that I will make no
further systems modificaitons, without their approval, on board _Paladin_.
Therefore, I can only observe at this time.  It does seem to me that there
might be some synaptic trauma, although I cannot be adequately certain until
they allow me to access her autonomous CPU.  Fortunately, it is connected with
the greater network._

- ----Paladin----

As soon as Doctor Limner hears \'Vouf mention the way Iasic modified
the circuitry on Aurora, he comments, "Yes, that would explain it.
It reminds me of a time on..."

Suddenly, "Oh my God!"

Limner rushes to his equipment, right to his databanks, pops open a
panel, and brings a small magnifying glass to the circuitry.

Noticing that the equipment has already been altered, he pops open
several other panels, only to find the same thing.  He quickly stands
up, and looks for a second like he\'s going to faint again.  He then
starts to reach towards some of his other equipment, and suddenly
Doctor Limner seems to notice Charyn\'s condition.

Looking back and forth between Charyn and something in amongst his
equipment several times, Limner appears to be in a quandry.  Stopping
himself, Limner frowns a frown which those familiar with him know
indicates that he is thinking very intently.

Suddenly, he makes up his mind and walks over to Charyn.

\'Zar and Morser are already helping her at this time.  Pulling out a
medical scanner, Limner begins taking readings.

"No obvious physical causes."

He then notices that she is still connected into the ship\'s computer.

He leaves her connected rather than risk further trauma....

- ----Aurora----

Disturbing, nightmarish dreams rob Christian of rest. Neither refreshed nor
truly rested, he sits up on the bed, wishing he could just fall back and
submit to the sudden desire to avoid reality by a logy day of rest and
recreation. A shake of the head does little to sweep away the cobwebs of
sleep that infest his cranium, so it is with some little reluctance that
Christian calls up an extra-vigorous cycle on the water/sonic shower as he
steps inside. As the sharp jets of water needle his exposed flesh, Christian
grits his teeth at the sudden and intense stimulation of the shower. Two
efficient minutes later and he steps out, now fully, if involuntarily, awake.

A brief interlude of calisthenic stretching and he almost feels human
again. Tossing the scattered garments of the previous day into the
auto-laundry bin, Christian locates fresh undergarments. As the thin
shirt passes over his head, he looks around at the rest of the cabin,
scowling at the mess \'Vouf left after moving in.

Christian slips into his by now usual black IISS uniform, tsk\'ing in
self-reproach as he remedies its less than pristine appearance. 

Suddenly, he hears the Tweel/Vouf conversations with Iasic and sits back
down on the bed with a slightly quizzical, but plainly interested, look on
his face. At the mention of Charyn\'s unusual condition, his initial
surprise is quickly followed by a concerned frown as he arrives on the
bridge in a jiffy. Listening intently as the updates come in over the
ether, Christian silently establishes a data channel link with the medical
instruments aboard the Paladin and closely watches Charyn\'s scan results
as the investigation progresses. Intent on his work, he seems to be holding
a vigil as he leans back in the pilot\'s couch, hoping that his services (or
those of any other of the medical team) wouldn\'t be required, again...

 ----Kingfisher----

Johann looks at the secondary display puring out text as the test commences.
Suddenly he stops, disconnects the suit from the crash-couch and runs aft
in the shuttle. "Just a second!"

 Almost as soon as he is gone, he appear again on the bridge carrying a bag
out of his luggage. He sits down at the empty sensor console and begin to
rummage through the bag, bringing out a pocket-sized holocrystal box.  Opening
the box he takes out a red crystal with orange markings and smiles "If that
virus comes here, It\'ll get the surprise of a lifetime!"
  
Witfield once again tries to estiblish comm link with the Aslan ship, as
well as attempting to disconnecting one of the radios from comm circuity
for audio speaker only, not to mention running a diagnisis. His hands are
flying everywhere on the console.

"Mr Jett. Can you help with the radio?"

Richard spares a quick glance at Ger. "Affirmative, Admiral." He steps over
to the communications station to assist Witfield, as needed.

Ger then initiates communication with the Aslan ship.  "Admiral Akhouw, this
is Admiral Nanadh. We seem to have experienced some computer trouble are you
experiencing the same? It seems to be some infestation probably from the
ring...  I believe the Imperial fleet is possibly a manifestation of that
virus."

"We encountered an Imperial fleet at our deep-space refueling point
and we are aware of the destruction of another ringworld by imperial
forces."

Johann turns to Zben and whispers, "We are?!"

- ----Aurora----

The commotion over Charyn\'s condition sinks through the haze settling on
The Ael\'s brain.  His head twists upsidedown to look at the ceiling, wishing
for a sky to scan while considering what is for his limited conciousness,
an academic problem.

"Kerrr, Chip-Skawk, Chip-Skawk..." he whistles a quick call into the intercom,
but cuts himself short and translates to galanglic, "Medicallll rrrrrobot
marrrk ssseven, rrreporrrt herrre imediately."  He repeats himself a few times
trying to articulate his failing galanglic sufficiently for the robot to
understand.  Finally, in frustration he fires off a piercing stream of musical
twitterings.

He then begins to work on a quick and dirty brain interface connection to the
Iasic terminal.  The terminal blinks for a moment when he makes a connection
to the port.    Puzzled he looks closer at the wiring and discovers a mistake
an assistant electronics specialist would blush at, and tries again.

This time the terminal cuts out completely and reboots.  "Cosh-Cosh-Cosh!"
Tweel fumbles with the wiring a moment before \'Vouf grabs the terminal and
connects the jury-rigging himself with a critical eye directed toward the
bleary scientist.

Almost as if to save Tweel the embarrasment, Triple Three arrives with Lucan
and Dulinor in tow having translated the musical chirps for the benefit of
the Medbots.

"Shrep!  Ex-ex-ex-excellllent.  Come herre!"  He motions to Lucan who moves
over to the scientists side and focuses his sensors on the tiring Ael.
"K-K-K!  I\'m fine!  Now be a good little rrrobot and let me have yourr
brrain..."  With a little bit of fumbling, Tweel connects the robot\'s brain
interface with the Iasic Terminal.

With effort Tweel controls his galanglic, "Now, begin downloading of
medical prrogrraming."

Tweel now turns to the terminal and sings another melody of chirps and
twitters counting on Iasic\'s ability to now understand Ael Yael Language.
*Iasic, I am singing you a diagnostic program for basic human structure.
It should aid your navigation of the winds occuring in the human Charrrrryn.*

"Here, let me help you," \'Vouf mutters, reconnecting the mess Tweel\'s
made of the interface to the medbot. "Iasic," he adds sternly to Tweel\'s
statement, "We are authorizing you to seek out and repair damage to
Charyn, but NOT to reconfigure her autonomous CPU in any way. She is to
be restored to functionality, but NOT modified. Do you understand? It
is difficult to explain why this is vital-- no doubt you will find her
an inefficient mechanism. But it IS vital."

Christian maintains his silent watch, but spares \'Vouf a meaningful glance
and an emphatic nod of the head.

- ----Talisman----

Kimball Redd, sitting alone in the lower deck of  engineering,  listening
to  the  muted roar of the powerplant on the deck above, suddenly notices
the time -

"Ouch! - I\'ve been stuck at these controls for hours.  Where\'s  Ralf  got
 himself to ? He can\'t have *that* much gear to stow." 

Tapping into the ships  ENVIRONMENT /SECURITY  section,  he  types  in  :

"Gone to catch up on his sleep, I\'ll bet. Lucky whatsisname."

RALF IS NOT AT ANY DUTY STATION, comes the cryptic reply....

He sits up, shocked. "What the--?"

	The quick scan of internal life support systems shows Ralf in a

- ----Paladin----

Listening to the continuing Dialog as Dr. Tweel removes the robot\'s brain,
Goughzar looks back to Dr. Limner. 

"I\'m sorry doctor. I assume you have everything in hand. Is there anything I
can do to help Charyn? If not, I\'ll pretend I still have some manner of control
over this craft and continue on our course.

"Paladin, Continue full spectrum scans and continue archiving to Alcyon."

Testing the "link" to the Aurora, \'Zar remarks, "\'Vouf, I think this is going
to be an interesting landing. I never expected a sentient world...." 

"Neither did I, little cousin," Bhyarrvouf whispers. "Neither did ANY of us."

Switching on the intercom, Limner replies:

"If Charyn is in no immediate danger, then I think she\'d rather I tried
to treat her first, Iasic.  We humans like to solve our own problems
where possible.  But I would appreciate some assistance.  When we first
arrived in-system, some of my equipment was overloaded by a very strong
psychic message.  I started a program running on this computer whose
purpose was to isolate and identify a number of psionic abilities and
conditions, using the Paladin\'s own sensors.  Could you analyze that
program and use the data I had uploaded to analyze team member Charyn?
Since it also contains brain scans of a number of various mental
conditions, you should be able to determine what type of damage she has
suffered without directly accessing her \'autonomous CPU\'."

Limner has started running more tests on Charyn, while other crew
members move her into a better position.

"I fear that her being attached to the sensors while you arrived on the
Paladin may have caused dangerous feedback into her \'autonomous CPU\',
although I can detect no signs of the type of damage that would occur
under those circumstances.  In fact," Limner picks up another scanner,
which he places near the base of Charyn\'s scalp, "the closest I have
seen to this condition was caused by psychic, rather than electrical
feedback.  I cannot tell without more information, however."

As Limner finishes his short discussion with Iasic, Zar moves back to his
station and sits down.

\'PALADIN, cancel GQ. Accept route from Iasic for even power landing.

Sitting stunned for a few more minutes, he finally seems to come to, although
still wondering about the wonders of the ringworld.

\'Iasic, if you have a chance, who created you? And since you\'ve modified our
computer system, and the network is self-perpetuation, exactly what rating do
we have for this now. I assume you can access our databases and determine our
rating system.

_Indeed, I have accessed your databases.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to
satisfactorily equate the efficiency of the new information management
construction to your rating system.  Nevertheless, I will attempt to make a
ballpark estimate.  _Paladin\'s_ system could now best be equated to a
model/11bis.  This rating rises to a model/13 when I am directly linked to it.
A similar improvement can be equated to the other systems on the other ships.
However, they are now merely a part of the _Paladin\'s_ system.  Or, rather,
they are now all a part of the same system, whose primary CPU is located on
the _Paladin_.  Although I further enhance the system\'s performance, it is
completely autonomous._

- ----R-Alpha, the Jijid Village----
 
Ayrlathi hurries to answer the frantic tinkling of his doorbell.
 
"What in all Issin Jiliss--" he mutters as he opens the door, and
looks down upon the visage of a young jijid who appears to be in a
state of great agitation.  "Elivadin!  Whatever is the matter?"
 
"Ayrlathi..." the youth says in a pleading tone, "Teacher... please
come quickly!  Something very strange has happened in the park!"
 
"Strange?  What do you mean?"  Ayrlathi is determined not to allow
Elivadin to fluster him.
 
Elivadin blurts: "A huge creature appeared out of nowhere.  It was
shiny and hard, like an insect, and it carried a different, smaller
creature in its arms.  It said the small creature is a visitor from
the sky, but it is hurt and needs our help.  Then the big one
disappeared, leaving the small one behind.  It is still there, but no
one knows what to do with it.  The edo najizev are not sure that they
want to touch it.  We need you -- a member of the Ezad -- please come
and help."
 
Ayrlathi breathes deeply as he struggles to take all this in.  With
slow deliberation he blinks -- first with his inner pair of eyes,
then with his outer -- and fixes the youngster carefully in his
gaze.  Elivadin, he knows, is not given to inventing fanciful tales,
and the degree of urgency in his voice is enough to convince Ayrlathi
that the account must at least have some basis in truth.
 
"All right, Elivadin.  Now listen carefully.  What I want you to do
is to run and find the Fedwis.  Tell him what has happened, and ask
him to call a meeting of the full Ezad as quickly as possible.  I
will go to the park and find out what is happening."
 
"Yes, teacher," says Elivadin, and he gallops off as fast as his
stumpy legs will carry him.
 
Ayrlathi trots off in the opposite direction -- towards the park --
not troubling even to close his front door behind him.  Although he
managed to maintain a calm exterior for Elivadin\'s benefit, his
insides are in turmoil.  He tries to persuade himself not to make
any judgements before he has had a chance to see this "creature"
for himself.
 
When he reaches the park, he discovers that a crowd of considerable
size has already gathered.  There is much confusion and consternation
among the assembled jijid.  Some of them spot him approaching.  "Look,"
says one.  "Here comes Ayrlathi.  He will know what to do."  Another
calls out, "Let him pass.  Let the Ezadid through!"
 
The crowd do their best to part to allow Ayrlathi to come through.
There is considerable shuffling and jostling, and numerous little
nadathilallile flowers get accidentally trampled, but eventually
he arrives to look upon the object of all this fuss.
 
It it the strangest creature he has ever set eyes on.  There it is,
sprawled on the ground -- a two-legged thing, lean and frail-looking.
Ayrlathi waves back some of the jijid who are crowding too closely
around, and bends his front knees to take a closer look.  He slowly
extends a finger and -- ever so gently -- touches what appears to be
its shoulder.  There is no response.  With some sadness Ayrlathi
notes the creature\'s multiple injuries, and wonders briefly how it
came to be in such a state.
 
Ayrlathi\'s hand moves up to the thing\'s head and lightly plays across
the bright yellow growth which sprouts from it.  A child\'s voice in
the crowd calls out: "Look at its tendrils!  They\'re all stiff!  The
poor mimp must be dead!"
 
As if to refute this, the creature moves.  Its head turns, and an arm
raises weakly, only to flop down a few moments later as consciousness
departs again.  Ayrlathi is so startled he leaps backwards and stumbles
into another jijid.  Then he remembers that these people are looking
to him for guidance and quickly composes himself.
 
Ayrlathi spends a few moments looking around and thinking.  Then he
turns and beckons to one of the edo najizev who has been lurking
nearby, rather nervously holding his bladed weapon at the ready.
"Put that away," Ayrlathi tells him.  "This... thing... is clearly
not in any position to pose a threat to us.  Help me carry it to
Tehidazi, and she can treat its wounds.  Gently, now."
 
With some reluctance, the najizevid does as Ayrlathi bids.  Together
they carefully slide their hands underneath the creature and lift it
from the ground.
 
Another nearby jijid speaks:  "What about these objects -- I think they
are bags of some kind -- which appeared with it?"
 
"Leave them where they are, for now," says Ayrlathi.  "I think it is
better not to touch them.  We do not know what they might be.  Ask
a najizevid to keep watch on them."
 
With that, Ayrlathi and his helper begin to make their way slowly but
steadily out of the park towards Tehidazi\'s house.  Many of the other
jijid trail along behind them, eager to find out more about this bizarre
new arrival.  It only takes a few minutes to arrive at their destination.
 
Tehidazi is standing waiting for them in her doorway -- she has evidently
heard word of what has happened and anticipated that she would be called
upon.  "Take it inside," she tells them, "and lay it on the table where
I can examine it."  She steps out of the doorway to allow the two
carrying the visitor from the sky to come through, and then interposes
herself in front of the following crowd.  "That\'s enough!  I\'m not
having half the population of Hilawin in my house!"  She closes the
door and turns to follow Ayrlathi, the najizevid and their strange
burden.

=====================================================

- ----Kingfisher----

As Doctor Abuko continues to bustle about, checking circuits, Richard frowns
slightly as a thought occurs to him. He moves over to where Johann is located,
and engages him in quiet conversation. "Dr. Abuko, if the fleet was a viral
creation, I assume you would have found that by now. Assuming that it is
not of that ilk, what *was* it and of what source?"

Obviously startled out of his intense concentration on the displays, Johann
looks up. "Eh.. I haven\'t found anything yet, both the sensors and what I see
of the computer is running fine. But viruses are just one form of interference,
there are scores of different methods of fooling a computer, trojan horses, 
backdoors, timebombs, puzzles, sneaks, it could have been anyone of those. 
It could also have been pure deception jamming, but to make such a convincing
show by that method you\'d had to have a very good knowledge of our systems."
He indicates the crystal. "I hope the selftest will reveal something so that
I don\'t have to run it. It is one of the most effective intrusion couter-
measures programs outside purely military, and it will defeat any virus
detected up to a few weeks ago, but it is a bit \'bloodthirsty\' and may
damage some legitimate..."

- ----Talisman----

A priority message prints out on the screen of _Talisman\'s_ main CPU.
It is accompanied with a smooth, calm, male voice, reading the words as it
prints them out.

_Attention Talisman crew.  By directive of the MasterCPU R-Alpha, your
information management system, as well as all subsequent sub-processes, have
been integrated into the greater IASC25632APRAT network.  Your system is now
functioning at 166% previous efficiency.  Do not attempt to disrupt the link,
as it is already established.  Any such action would leave your vessel in
jeopardy of a general systems failure, which at this time, would be extremely
prejudicial to your current tactical situation.  You may now communicate
directly with me, R-Alpha, _Aurora_, and _Paladin_, without use of your radio
or laser communications equipment.  Furthermore, your sensors and all other
ship operations are being handled by the integrated network, rather than
exclusively by your singular computer array._

The screen clears.

_MasterCPU R-Alpha will contact you shortly._

 ----Kingfisher/Trakh----

Upon establishment of visual communications, a powerfully built Aslan
male with a full, thick mane in full uniform turns to face the screen.
(See description to follow later.) He speaks, choosing his words with
deliberate care. "Admiral Akhouw _Tra\'Ekhaul_, Admiral Nanadh," he
firmly corrects Ger. "I will overlook the impoliteness."

He then continues, "Indeed, Admiral, my information does not indicate an
infestation of any ringworld \'virus\' here. It would seem that computer
operation is not at fault. To the contrary, it is reminiscent of a tactic
used by wily ship captains. I have encountered similar events in my years
of command. As you command all other ships here, the local shuttle excepted,
it would seem that it is for you to explain this incident. Such an explanation
will assist in maintaining good will between us."

"We also encountered such a fleet on our journey here, although we were
not able to positively identify the origins or purpose of that fleet."

Ger continues, "Well Admiral I am glad to hear that you don\'t have any
virus in your computers, but according to my second, the virus is real,
and infesting at least two of my ships. As to any deliberate phantom fleets,
if that is what your message is referring to, you have my word that I have
nothing to do with any sensor fabrications. If your ship\'s computer is not 
affected then possibly one of my ships\' computers was compromised, we are
running diagnostics as we speak."

"It is not your word that I doubt, Admiral Nanadh.." is the mild reply.
"The facts, as I have them, clearly indicate at attempt at sensor
tampering, quite probably associated with the... (checking the holotank
readouts)... Talisman. I trust you will properly conduct your inquiry
so that I may honorably pursue matters at some future time." Akhouw
half-nods in the traditional manner of Aslan ritual.

"Speaking of ships commanded, it would be good for relations if you
could disclose the general make-up of the rest of your fleet, as an Admiral,
especially one of your obvious experience, surely could not be commanding
a single ship."

Akhouw laughs politely. "Thank you, Admiral Nanadh, for the compliment.
Certainly you do me justice, as your name is not unknown to me. I hear
your words, but truly, Admiral, you cannot expect me to give you my
secrets without permission from Khaukeairlko." Akhouw spreads his hands
wide. "What you see is what you get, Admiral Nanadh, but as for the
future..." Akhouw shrugs his shoulders and grins toothily.

"Perhaps if you could inform us of the location where you spotted the
imperial fleet, we could determine their course and if they are a possible
threat. We spotted them at Imperial Coordinates 1506/Reaver\'s Deep".

"Quite clearly, Admiral Nanadh, they are a threat. If we were correct in
presuming our respective incidents to have occurred with the same Imperial
or Solomani fleet, probability shows that this immense world may yet be
on their itinerary. However, our observation was approximately five eakhau
prior to your incident (that is, one of your weeks) at IC 1404/Reaver\'s Deep.
Clearly we have encountered *two* different fleets!"

Emotion is a chained, toothless monster.  Joy, rage, sorrow, once the
masters, are now obedient, infrequently summoned servants.  They are
seldom needed.  Now no longer at their beck and call, there is time...
time for reflection.

In the freedom of thought, it is a warm autumn day.  A gentle breeze
stirs the leaves on the ground.  Somewhere, nearby, Vivaldi is playing.
In the distance, stands a manor house, with windows smashed and broken.
Weathered and unkept for years, it\'s facade slumps and crumbles.  It
is no longer a fit dwelling for the living.

Bishop wanders the reclaimed estate of his mind, content, and not quite
alone.  A single companion is company enough, for now.  Soon, there will
be others.  An old oak stands alone, as a single detailed memory, where
once a forest stood.  Others still stand, but they are few and widely
scattered.  Running his hand over the bark, savoring the texture, the
richness of detail, Bishop turns his face to the sun.

Light.  Magnificent, warm, heavenly light.  Everywhere, suffusing
everything.  The darkness is banished.  It will never return.  Never.

No pain.  No fear.  Only light.

- ----The R-Alpha System----

Energy output is dramtically up all over the ringworld.  Neutrino sensors
peg themselves against their limits.

- ----Kingfisher----

Aboard the Kingfisher, events suddenly turn in a new direction.  On Abuko\'s
sensor console, all of the target squares begin to blink as a low buzzer
sounds. Johann breaks off the conversation immediately and checks the small
tags that have appear beside each square. "Why is everybody suddenly
starting up a small parallel powerplant, and why do all of them have the
same output?!" He wonders aloud as he starts a general scan in lack of any
other good ideas, but then the energy scan finds R-alpha....

  "Commander, R-alpha is acting up. It\'s radiating neutrinos like it\'s
trying to imitate a sun, strong enough to be noticable through the sidelobes
of the neutrino detectorpointed the other way!"
 
At this point, a strong audio-only radio signal overrides the dialog
between Ger and Akhouw with a broadcast to both ships.  (It is later
discovered that the Alcyon received the same broadcast simultaneously.)

"To all sophonts aboard the vessel Trakh/Kingfisher/Alcyon:
Please tune your FM data communication tranceiver to 1337.45
Mhz and connect your navigation console to its output."

"Navigation and landing instructions to follow."

Abuko\'s sensors (and those aboard the Trakh) indicate the message originates
from all points of the ring simultaneously.  The message continues.

"With your permission, I will now load navigation information into
your ships, showing you where to steer to bring you to a pleasant
location prepared several years ago for your arrival.  You should
find it quiet and recreational."

Etienne accepts the incoming navigation data and sets it up on his board,
but does NOT begin to maneuver.

"Commander Ger, orders, sir?"

The mysterious radio voice continues, "If you prefer, I can bring you
there directly."

Then, in a signal directed solely at the Kingfisher, the calm, male voice
continues:

"To the sophont in charge of this ship:"

"One of your sophonts aboard the Alcyon seems to be awakening
and recovering from a chemical accident, and his physician
is aboard your ship.  Because of recent actions, this medical
technician is unable to further help his patient."

"The Paladin, Aurora, Talisman and Alcyon are now tied together 
with an intantaneous communication network, and there are 
doctors aboard them to help the ailing sophont."

"I can authorize Iasic to connect you to this network if you
so choose, or you can remain isolated.  If you join the network,
I can provide augmented landing instructions as well."

"Iasic has been mildly chastised and will not improve your systems
beyond this without your permission."

  Johann frowns visibly when it mentions connecting a console to outside
influence and begins fingering the holocrystal, but he says nothing.

- ----Aurora/Paladin----

After a brief pause, a somewhat familiar voice returns.

"Thank your for loading that species-specific information.  The Iasic
construct is now connecting the vessel you know as \'Talisman\' to
your network.  Please accept my apologies for earlier trying to 
contact you psionically.  I seem to have forgotte just how fearful
your kind is of being manipulated.  I will use the interface that
the Iasic unit constructed, for now.

"The one known as Charyn is in no danger.  Those called Limner and
Morser are well are their way to properly diagnosing her condition,
and their discovery will be of more value to you if I do not hinder
their investigations.

"The unit known as Ralf is not in immediate danger, and can be treated
when you can get to him.

"Again, welcome to this little corner of the universe.  Please follow
the shuttle to a safe landing area."

"Well! Ahem." Bhyarrvouf straightens his fur a bit. "On behalf of the
explorers of the ring, I would like to thank you for the courtesy of
your welcome. To whom am I speaking?"

"Why, I am this world.  The natives here call me a variety of things,
the Hoop, the GameMaster, Land Above, One who leads, and some not
nearly so pleasant."

\'Vouf\'s ears wilt. "...Oh."

- ----Talisman----

Shrike over interior commo: "Hey Thule, you\'re the captain of this thing, got
any orders for us?  And what was that message from Vouf about?"

Said aloud to bridge crew: "Anybody got any guess as to what this ias.. 
whatever network is?"

Alliara: "Bloody computers interfering again! Why can\'t they make good virii
- - erase government files, for example. Why does it have to be a bloody
computer here and a bloody computer there?! 

"I WANT SAVAGES, not computers!"

Shrike: "OK Isic, or whatever your called, your got the stick, but if I call
override you give control back to me, OK?  And make sure you put all the info
I need on the screens."  With this Andon will lean back in the chair and see
what happens.

Thul replies, "Let\'s get this ship ready to land wherever this bloody Iasic
says to.   I gotta funny feeling the first one to start
raising hell around here is going to get themself smeared...
( as he casts a wary eye at the pips representing the Aslan ships.... )

	"We got some kinda high tech network bug infiltrating our
computers.  Don\'t try to unplug it is what \'Vouf told me.  And DO
NOT try jacking into it RALF!"

No answer.

"...Ralf?"

Silence.

Thul slaps the all-call. "Has anyone seen--"

"Redd here, Thul," comes Kimball\'s voice over the intercom. "I\'ve found Ralf,
all right. Looks like you were a little late...."

- ----Aurora----

Distracted by his observation of Charyn\'s condition, a few seconds pass
before Christian realizes what has happened. His face reflects feelings
of curiosity and anticipation. He sits up in the couch and secures his
restraint harness, then plugs his vacc suit into the local life support
system and turns to the navigation controls. A few seconds of computing,
then a thin white line curves through the holotank, confirming the
flight parameters and destination point.

He looks over at \'Vouf. "Well, aenrra, looks like we\'ve gotten an
engraved invitation to a real ringworld party by the landlord... Unless
you\'ve an objection, I\'ll transfer the flight plan from the navcomp
and take us down to investigate." Christian\'s fingers are poised over
the holopanels, ready to begin the descent.

"NEGATIVE on that, Chief Medical Officer," Bhyarrvouf says sharply, making
a sharp cutting motion with the edge of a gauntleted hand. "In case you\'ve
forgotten, we have been elected to the dubious honor of LAST to step onto
the ring. We have a rendezvous to make, first. My orders stand."

He looks over at Christian and his eyes twinkle. "But I WILL authorize a
change in heading so that the rendezvous occurs en route to the landing.
As long as we have a delta vee of zero with respect to the Westwind and
Gemini Arbiter, we can all match speeds with the Ring while we get 
together. Get on it, will you? With an eye on Mister Robins, of course, 
in the meantime. I\'ll notify the other ships."

Tweel listens groggily to the course and rendezvous changes being made.

"Dee-Dee-Dee-Dee-Dee!  If-if-if we\'rrre flying forrrr the Rrrring...
I ex-ex-ex-ex-expect we\'ll get our answerrrrs sssssoon enough..."

His neck collapses for a moment and he lifts his head back up dizzily.

A gargling whistle sounds deep in his throat,
"How-how lllong flight?  Mussst sssleep beforrrre arrrrivalll..?"

Tweel looks unsteadily at \'Vouf for an answer and then he buries his head
in his wings and his breathing becomes more regular.  Standing motionless
on the perch, Tweel is out cold.

The intercom comes alive [sic] again:

"Here\'s a minimum energy course for you to follow to reach that rendezvous,
{one shows on the holo}, and here\'s a minimum time rendezvous that
assumes Iasic begins repairs on the Gemini Arbiter almost immediately."

"Would you please call them and ask permission?"

"Glad to," \'Vouf chuckles. He keys in the intercom.

"Westwind and Gemini Arbiter, this is Aurora. We will rendezvous in five
hours. Please alter course as follows.... <data blip> This is to allow
us to rendezvous while matching speedss with the Ringworld for a landing."

"I wonder when Iasic is going to hit the Fingkisher?" he wonders out loud.

The voice answers once more.

"I have instructed him to stay away from the Kingfisher and the Trakh.
These two ships have shut down all communication with the outside,
except with each other apparantly trying to avoid talking to me.  No
problem."

"The crew of the Gemini Arbiter is the most in need of assistance right now,
and I\'d like to join them to your network.  Therefore, that is Iasic\'s
current assignment."

A thought suddenly occurs to Christian. "Iasic, at some future time we will
leave this system and travel elsewhere. How will this affect the network you
have constructed -- will its components operate seperately or would you need
to make further modifications?" 

Iasic, apparently in deference to the Hoop, doesn\'t answer, as it continues:

"One more minor matter, apparantly one of your sophonts aboard the
Alcyon is recovering from some chemical accident.  His surgeon,
Yorblin is aboard the Kingfisher and cannot contact him.  The
Alcyon is connected to this network however, and there seem to
be several biological technicians capable of mantaining his 
condition for the time being."

Bhyarrvouf\'s ears snap straight up at that. If he was asleep a minute ago,
it doesn\'t show now....

"What in the name of the Great Pack are you talking about? Doctor Yorblin 
didn\'t have any ongoing caseload, except Anton Devious and...."

His voice trails off. His eyes stare at nothing. He whispers, "I just had
this crazy DREAM...."

Caught dead in the middle of some navigation work, Christian\'s fingers
finish the task at hand as his eyebrows head as far north as is humanly
possible. As his right hand completes the transfer of the updated nav
plot to thruster control, his left hand is a blur, tapping into the
network and calling up direct control and data input of the Alcyon
sickbay, concentrating on one low berth in particular...

His voice is surprised, yet somehow relieved. "Bishop!"

- ----Talisman----

On deck two of the Talisman, in the lounge/mess area-cum-sickbay,
going over medical supplies for the umpteenth time, Ian sighs.  
"Damn fool crusaders putting scientists in sick bay.  ..Might do
more more damage than leaving the injured alone.

"Hello -- What\'s this?"  Ian askes himself, half cocking his head
to one side.  He pulls out a chair and sinks into it, his eyes glazing 
slightly.

- ----Phin Shuttle----

*The craft rising from the Hoop have been observed.  They have shown no hostile
intent. {The term "hostile" seems to have been a struggle to convey.}

*But it seems prudent to remove myself from any immediate confrontation.  It is
a standard reaction for us not to want unknowns on our \'flukes\'. {This last
word seems to be the best translation by the recipients.}*

Suddenly Doejin\'s psionic message is interrupted by a new \'voice.\' It
comes from the ship called the Talisman, and is directed at Ferdy.

*Ferdy!  I\'d me more than overjoyed to meet your friends.  I don\'t
know what\'s going on up here.  They shoved me into sick bay in case
somebody gets hurt.   They think I know medicine.  Isn\'t that a 
laugh?  I can\'t see anything, and they don\'t feed any sensor
data down into the middle of the ship, where I am now.  I keep
hearing radio broadcasts about (feared-type-emotion) Aslan.
(Confusion emotion) I don\'t understand this.  Aslan have saved
my life more times than humans have.  Go figure.*

*Doejin?  Katie? ....Hooper, is it? Hi! 
(big smile emotion)  I\'m Ian.  How\'re things on the Hoop?*
 
*Uhhh... hello Ian.*  Ferdy seems a little hesitant.  *Welcome back.
*It\'s been a long time.*
 
*Yes," says Ferdy, *the Aslan arrived not long before you did.
They\'ve been watching the Kythui.  I don\'t know why.  And now
several more ships have just turned up.  Humans, I think.*
 
*Things are a little confusing at the moment.  We were told to
expect visitors, but we didn\'t realise there were going to be
quite so many!  Are your people going to land?  How much have
you told them about us?*
 
An aside to the other Phins:  "Can we show them a good place to
land?  Somewhere that won\'t be too dangerous?  How about on the
open plains near Ancient Prime?"

- ----Aurora----

"He\'s alive." Not daring to raise his voice for fear of waking the
sleeping Tweel, Bhyarrvouf cuts his voice back to a whisper. A tear
rolls down his muzzle. "In the Name of the Thagk-Kabra...."

"How\'s it possible, aenrra? There should be nothing left of him!"

After a pause of several seconds, Christian speaks, slowly, as if he
is piecing it together as he talks. "Adrian was pretty healthy, as far
as his body was considered. We got to him in time to minimize the damage
from his cardio-pulmonary arrest, so except for the brain damage and the
ravages of his multiple chemical soup addictions, his body was fine."

His eyes narrow slightly, evidence of rapid, concentrated thought occurring
in Christian\'s mind. "Of course, the neural damage was too extensive for
anything less than full neuro-reconstruction at a major research hospital,
so we left him pretty much as is, except for the nanocytes that Jan injected
to tidy up the worst of the damage and stabilize his pathways. Hmm..."

Christian leans back in his seat, finger to lips as his eyes gaze at nothing
in particular, the picture of thoughtfulness. He reaches his conclusion in
nearly a minute. As if a light switch were thrown, Christian\'s features
are suddenly illuminated with discovery, silently screaming EUREKA!

He snaps his right hand and delightedly, playfully gives \'Vouf a light
whack on the shoulder. "That\'s *it*!" he says in an excited whisper, out
of respect for Tweel\'s desperate need for sleep. He turns to look right
at \'Vouf, his right index finger stabbing at an empty spot on his console,
as if to emphasize his points. "Listen, aenrra, we\'ve ran into this Iasic
\'construct\' that can *rewire* computer systems, right? So what did Jan put
into Adrian? Nanocytes! Little, minute machines, for rukh\'s sake! Besides,
what *IS* the brain but a complex, ORGANIC machine, a computer? That\'s got
to be it -- someway, somehow, it(?) got to Adrian, and REWIRED him! It\'s
as if a computer\'s software was corrupted but the hardware was sound -- all
you\'d have to do is fix the programming!"

Some of his initial excitement seems to have worn off Christian, as he takes
on a more serious pose. "Of course, the question is, WHO is coming back? I
mean, I could understand how a little thing like death could change a person.
He may have some problems with memory, and who knows how his personality may
have changed." He glances at \'Vouf. "He may be a quite new version of Adrian
Bishop, unlike what we knew..." His eyes wander over to the twin medical
readouts of Charyn and Adrian. "A pity, that. I would have wanted to know
why Adrian refused the offer to slowly reduce the need for his addictions,
the help that would have made the transition slow but sure, without real
pain or harship. As if a drowning man refused a floatation device that was
thrown to him... I wouldn\'t have forced him, but I don\'t think anyone had
ever offered him the choice, the chance to take control. He didn\'t just
say no, he said no, period."

Christian folds his arms as he leans back against the couch, as his eyes
gaze out into space in the direction of the Alcyon.

\'Vouf looks thoughtful after Christian\'s speech. "Hrmph." He reaches
over to the comm panel and keys in the Alcyon\'s tight-beam heading.

"Morgan, this is \'Vouf. Have Dr. Werner check on Adrian Bishop, OK? Out."

He then says to no one in particular, "Iasic, how extensive has your 
interaction with Bishop been?"

Iasic has no time to answer....

A deafening high-pitched shriek-whistle blasts out of the stillness.
The ceiling rings under a sudden double blow as Tweel suddenly tries
to take flight.

\'Vouf and Christian simply stare as Tweel is suddenly looking back at
them, his wings spread showing the now red eyespot scars.  "Macin?..."
The word dies on his beak.

He gives a hateful glance at the ceiling and buries his head in his wings
again.

Carefully and with exaggerated slowness, Vouf smooths down his fur, which
was standing on end all the way down his back. "I HATE when he does that,"
he growls in Vuakedh.

- ----Talisman----

Dave has been sitting in the crew lounge, alternately putting on and taking
off his vacc suit helmet.  :-) Seriously, he wasn\'t asked to go anywhere and
has been spending his time tapped into the ship\'s computer trying to
retrieve any available information about R-alpha and natives.

Now that we finally have an order to put on vacc suits (I seem to recall
going to general quarters [vacc suits] once before and having it cancelled),
Dave will re-attach his vacc suit helmet and check connections.  If he can
be made use of on the bridge, call him.  He is an expert in covert survey
and initial contact.  He doesn\'t speak Aslan, however.  

If Dave isn\'t needed on the bridge, he will continue futzing around with the
computer link.

- ----Phin Shuttle----

Having manuevered perpendicular to as many of the foreign ships as possible,
the crew of the phin shuttle settle back and watch for any hostile actions to
take place.

Communication with the Hoop (though no obvious EM transmissions are detected)
indicates to the Phin crew that things are well in hand and a trajectory to the
surface has been laid down.  But to expedite everyone\'s arrival, the Phin
shuttle is directed to assist the ship called Westwind to it\'s rendevous.

At that the Phin shuttle picks up acceleration beyond any that has been
seen by Aslan or Human (or Vargr).  Heading toward the Westwind with
interception _very_ shortly.

*After consultation, we are going to assist the ship called Westwind in their
rendevous with you and the Gemini Arbiter.  The Westwind moves too slowly for
events.  I shall see you at the Gemini Arbiter shortly.*

- ----Talisman----

An archway appears just in front of the aft bulkhead doorway in
the Talisman\'s mess area, and the the top third briefly glows
a pale greeninsh-blue.

"All expedition members, I\'m going over to the Phin shuttle.  See you
on the surface.  Thomas out."

Ian steps through the archway, and it disappears.

- ----Trakh----

Pausing in his conversation with Ger, Akhouw turns once again to
the holotank and considers the plotted decent path, then looks over
and observes Aiwi and Uhwaikh as they note and analyze the rapidly
incoming information. Muttering "Kiy, rakhea tiykoi... (The secrets
of this place, perhaps we shall learn now...)" he turns back to the
vid pickup.

"It seems that we are invited, you and I, to land on the ringworld.
Certainly it is a chance to answer questions I am sure both of us
have, Admiral Nanadh. May I have the pleasure of meeting you upon
our landing?"

Assuming that Ger responds positively, Akhouw ends the communications
with a polite "We shall meet later, then. Good day, Admiral" before
setting into his seat and verifying the navigational plot. "Fa\'eairl,
condition normal, stand down." As the lighting shifts to normal, the
power plant similarly returns to usual conditions.

"Uhwaikh, re-restablish secondary interlocks and put weapons power on
standby. Continue observations of ringworld sensor data."

As the Trakh begins its gentle descent to the specified landing area,
Akhouw opens a laser channel to the pinnace. "Eihoftyah, we are proceeding
to land on the ringworld and make contact with advanced indigenous sophonts
and likely these humans as well. Continue to observe the [Turnskaad] fleet
and enter "Ringworld High Guard" position above us. Stand down from alert
but remain vigilant. Trakh out."

A directional radio broadcast reaches out to the Aslan speeder. "This is
Admiral Tra\'Ekhaul. We are proceeding to a rendesvouz with ringworld
inhabitants and the human fleet at coordinates (here he passes along the
received navigational data). Continue your mission. The Khaurl will stand
ready for communications or other assistance. Acknowledge, Hfolraw. Trakh
out."

- ----Phin Shuttle----

At the contact with Ian, Doejin\'s curiosity about the visitors is at a peak.
First, Bharyvouf, and now Ian.  Plus, Ferdy\'s excitation is catching.  But
indications from the Hoop are that the ship called Gemini Arbiter needs help
and that the ship called Aurora is going to their aid.  But that leaves the
ship called Westwind still trying to catch up.

With Ian\'s indication of extreme boredom, Doejin makes a rash decision (best
kind for a Phin! :-), maneuvers out of the pilot console and maneuvers over
to an auxiliary console.

With the quick flash of flukes and mind control, the auxiliary panel lights
up and acitvates the Door.

An archway appears in the aft section of the command room of the phin shuttle.
It is sized sufficient for a Phin to maneuver through.

{Meanwhile a similar archway appears in the sickbay of the Talisman...}

Within a few seconds a human walks through the archway.  He is smiling and
greets Ferdy, "Hello and very good to see you!!  Doejin, I presume?" And he
sticks a hand out to Doejin who looks at it with a very curious look...

- ----Aurora----

The voice of the Hoop speaks once more:

"Is there anything you\'d care for me to do to prepare in any special way
for your landing?"

Bhyarrvouf gets a gleam in his eye at that, one that Christian has seen
before, usually in the company of wanted posters and pink and yellow fur.....

Bhyarrvouf begins to giggle. "I am such a CREEP!"

Christian snaps his head around and looks at \'Vouf with a look on his face
that indicates he\'s unsure of what\'s going on, and not at all sure he\'ll like
the answer. When he speaks, his tone is reminiscent of a parent talking to
a misbehaving child, gentle but alert. "Bhyarrvouf, what have you *done*?"

Bhyarrvouf chuckles. "If you\'ll excuse me, I have to contact the Gemini
Arbiter about our course change...." 

Christian stares blankly at \'Vouf for a second, then turns to his pilot
station and begins the necessary course corrections to establish the new
rendezvous/ringworld landing flight path.

As he works, Christian seems to be singing some sort of Terran ditty as he
goes about his navigation and sensor tasks. If someone listens very closely,
they would swear the refrain goes something like...

"....and only mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the mid-day sun..."

"Mad dogs? Might that, perchance, be a reference to yours truly?"
Bhyarrvouf bounds out of his chair cheerfully. "Gahh. Your problem,
aenrra, is that you lose your sense of humor when you\'re under stress.
If anything, you should be MORE able to laugh when things get tough!
And if that makes me a \'mad dog\', well, then, so be it."

Christian smiles as he continues to monitor the various stations, in an
analogous mood. "That *was* a joke, aenrra..." He amusedly eyes \'Vouf.
"You better than most should understand that I have a perfectly functioning
sense of humor. Besides, better a Mad Dog than Voufie the Wonder-Pooch, eh?"
His grin widens markedly.

\'Vouf looks fondly over at the sleeping Tweel. "Exhausted," he mutters.
"You\'ve gotten some sleep, and I\'ve had a short nap, but he was up the
whole time, and that just after an operation. Well, I have one or two
more things to do before I can put my nose under my tail.... and I think
the Ring is going to help me do them!"

He grins at Christian. "That big krafla-hoop out there reads minds. It
does it easily, and has a pretty good idea of how to best achieve the
aims of the person it\'s reading...."

And with that, as if on cue, an arched, glowing doorway silently shimmers
into shape at the back of the Bridge, just behind \'Vouf. "Ah, just in time," 
he says, checking his gear and straightening his uniform. "Don\'t wait
up for me, aenrra," he says gaily, stepping forward. "I\'m going to the
Gemini Arbiter. Back soon!"

And with that, the archway fades and is gone.

Christian is unfazed by the sudden turn of events. He contents himself with
a brief reply. "Just make sure they\'ve had their shots, aenrra. Oh, one
other thing, I understand they\'re diplomats and I realize just how
entertaining they can be (irony alert), so if you *MUST* shoot them, try
to use tranqs, ok?" It is such a perfect dead-pan delivery that \'Vouf almost
isn\'t sure that Christian is joking...

Christian turns back to operating his ship, enjoying the rare opportunity of
late for a little peace and quiet aboard the Aurora. Happily whistling to
himself, he takes the opportunity (while no crisis is looming and he has
a couple hours to fill) and returns to a long interrupted computer analysis
of his last game of dhrage. His mind revels in the chance to put the current
matters of import aside and work on some truly recreational activity.

- ----Talisman----

Ralf finds that the transfer to _Paladin\'s_ model/10 is simpler than
expected. Much to his surprise, the system is ever so much more
complex... yet it is most definitely simpler in its operation. 

	Hmm.... Ralf mused to himself.  Much more sophisticated OS,
but quite elegant in execution...  I wonder what would happen if I
applied that to my heuristics re-integration algorithm... looks so
simple, but then in hindsight many great advances seem so...

Everything now functions as if it were part of a living, breathing entity.

	A gentle wind plucks at the edges of Ralf\'s cybernetic attention.
*Why do I feel like somebody\'s breathing over my shoulder...?* 
 
After a brief pause, a channel is offered to this electronic Gulliver.  With
some trepiditation, Ralf makes the connection.

	*Whoa!  Like, wow man, look at all the pretty colors!  I haven\'t
felt this way since I plugged a simulation of Lysergic Acid biochemical
interactions into my implant chip.  A breathtaking rush of knowledge, of
perspectives destroyed and recreated.  Reminds me of that cataclyst cult.
What did they call that drug... "shatter"?  Used it to "mind-assassinate"
their opponents.  It certainly cleaned my clock...*

_You now have a communication path which you can use to communicate with
me normally.  I apologize if I caused you any discomfort.  This path is
involatile.  As long as you do not disconnect it yourself from your end,
nor I from mine, we will be able to establish contact.  If you wish, you
may withdraw from this environment and return to Talisman.  Our communic-
ation will not be broken by this.  Given the current tactical situation,
it would perhaps be advisable for you to withdraw back to the refuge of
your vessel._

	Ralf spends a few more femtoseconds looking around the
restructured model/10, then does a datadump of the diagnostics output 
and information-structures.  *Some EXTREMELY interesting conceptual
structures here.  If I ever find another computer that can run them,
they could revolutionize information technology...*

	Relucantly, Ralf implements a server-agent and retires across the
data-umbilical to the Talisman.

	*Who... what ARE you?  What is your substance?  Where are you
from?  What is the solution to Fermat\'s last theorem?*

- ----On R-Alpha----

Hfolraw grounds the speeder in the clearing he has selected, quickly
brings up a communications console, and opens a maser link to the
Trakh.

"Hfolraw here, Admiral.  Message acknowledged.  We are preparing to
contact one of the primitives. My new coordinates follow.  Sir, we
have detected a massive increase in neutrino output.  I cannot
localize the source, but my instruments are indicating a huge power
plant somewhere in the plane of the ring.  Unless you have further
orders, we will proceed to intercept the primitive.  Speeder out."

- ----Gemini Arbiter----

"Aurora. We have received your message and are taking appropriate
precautions."

"No need to worry about us making any hostile actions towards anyone.
Once your systems are back on line you\'ll see why when you scan us."

"We will stay on the intercept course with you until we rendezvous.
However, due to your current situation we will remain isolated."

"We will also express our concern to the Westwind."

"Gemini Arbiter. Out."

A: "Well, now that the warnings are taken care of we\'d better start
   checking out this ship ourselves."

N: "Among everything else you\'ve gotten us into this really does it!
   Some alien virus ransacking our computer! Just what we need!"

A: "Nicky, look at this." (pointing to one of the display monitors).

N: "I\'ll put it on the main holo. . .

A: (turning to face Nicky and interrupting her ) "What do you mean
   ME getting us into this!"
  
   (meanwhile, the entity known as Iasic is busy integrating itself
    unobserved by the two arguing sisters)

A: ". . .You were the one that wanted to fix that stupid door!" 

N: (standing up and placing her hands on hips) "Now wait a minute!
   We agreed to perform the routine maintenance ourselves! You were
   the one to run into that asteroid!"

A: (equally, standing up and placing hands on hips) "What\'s this WE
    stuff! You\'re supposed to be the engineer. Besides, I wasn\'t 
    the one to ignore the warning signs while we were on Rhylanor
    that time!"

N: (abruptly falling into her seat) "That\'s not fair! How was I
   to know they were monitoring us! I . . "

At this point, the Gemini Arbiter\'s comm panel crackles to life.

_As per MasterCPU R-Alpha\'s directive, the vessel _Gemini Arbiter_ has now
been connected into the network.  I must explain that R-Alpha and Bishop are
not directly interlinked, as are the _Aurora_, _Paladin_, _Talisman_, and
_Gemini Arbiter_.  They are passively connected, however.  Their interaction
is conducted directly through my internal processors._

_The four interlinked vessels are now completely integrated.  The functions of
each ship being shared by the computers on board any one of the craft,
depending upon which system can best handle the task._

There is a moment of dead silence as both sisters turning to face the
bridge console.

A: "Well, so much for our security! Any bright ideas now?!"

N: "Lets talk to it!" (punching keys and looking at monitors)

A: (throwing hands into the air)
   "That\'s obvious! Since we probably can\'t do anything else!"

N: "This is very interesting. I\'ve managed to partially figure out
   what it did since we already had the programs running."

   (straightening up in the chair and putting on her best
   diplomatic persona)

a Vargr with stunning black and white fur, piercing blue eyes and a black

from the muzzle of each gun is touching each woman\'s forehead.

"Am I addressing," the Vargr says politely, "The sisters Xerxes?"

Actually, you\'d have a hard time persuading me to lend MCr30 to a
footloose adventurer.  But then, no-one with 6MCr in his pocket really
fits that description.  I personally could live comfortably off the
interest of that amount.

It sure will.  But if the ship\'s income climbs as much as the outgo
climbs, no problem.

So who would do it if they had only 6MCr?  At the kind of return a 30
year T-bill pays, those same six guys could settle down to a life of
luxury on most worlds.  Note that your standard of living only costs
Cr30,000 per annum unless you are a noble.

I like the idea.  But interstellar trade will evaporate except to the
protected systems, in that case.  And pirates like that are more like
Boskone: foreign warships masquerading as pirates.

No.  TCS assumes that if you want to build new ships, you decommission
old ones:  put them in ordinary, mothball them, whatever you prefer. 
Then use the extra money saved from maintenance to build new ones.  And
the situation you describe is exactly what happened in the USA between
wars last century:  the ships got older and more decrepit until the
shooting started, then they were replaced by modern ships.

I concede the point, though part of the effect you describe is a

Tobia fallen to Aslan?  You\'ve been reading Fairy Tales again, haven\'t

Fine.  I like it, as I said earlier.  It fits my needs quite well. 
Notice that it helps pirates operate farther from their bases as well,
which makes piracy slightly more feasible.

A good start, but just a start:-)

I hope not.  But governments DO do things like that.  How do you think
inflation happens?  And keep in mind that the USA\'s fraction of the GNP
spent on the military is almost ten times as high as the one ascribed to
Imperial worlds.  There is a lot of room for increasing the fleet size
in the Imperium.

    'body' => 'Well, here is the result of my comparison of the Traveller star map to real
life.  I want to start by saying that I am not an professional astronomer,
just somebody who has an idle interest in astronomy.  To help me with
this project, I used the 17th edition _Norton\'s Star Atlas_ and a list of
the stars and spectral classes of stars with an apparent magnitude brighter
that 3.5 (from Earth, of course) :) printed in the early seventies.

Incidentally, I\'d still be interested in hearing from people who have the
old Traveller map in the Library Data-style which shows some nebulae, and
could tell me what names are there, and in which sectors.

Of course, corrections and additions are welcome!

*********************
OUR GALAXY and CHARTED SPACE

The Milky Way Galaxy is a spiral galaxy with a radius of some 15,000 parsecs.
Charted Space is centered on the arbitrary point Reference/Core, which is
considered to be 10,000 parsecs from the galactic center.  Charted Space
is tiny in comparison to the galaxy, about 500 parsecs on a side.

That\'s not to say that that is all that has been explored, however.  The 
Solomani Confederation has sent ships out 3000 parsecs toward the rim --
about three-fifths of the way there.  It\'s not clear how far anyone has
explored along the spiral arms.  Most impressive of all is the Zhodani Core
Expeditions, which has systematically explored and at a few points even
colonized a subsector-wide corridor running 7000 parsecs toward the
galactic core itself.  In the next Core Expedition, the Zhodani are on
the verge of entering the core "bulge" itself, the point where the galaxy
thickens from a flattened disk into a ball surrounding the mysterious
center of our galaxy.  To realize how impressive this is, draw a scale map
of Charted Space sometime.  A jump6 ship might take forty or fifty years
to travel from Zhdant to the far end!

**********************
STARS AND INTERESTING OBJECTS

A flat map just can\'t simulate a three-dimensional space.  Whoever designed
the Traveller universe really didn\'t worry too much about reality or the
massive distortions that the flat approach would cause.  I was actually
quite surprised that *any* stars seemed to be reasonably close to the
right angles and ranges.

I started with the assumption that some "obvious" stars, like supergiants
such as Deneb or class "B" stars, would be deliberately placed.  I don\'t
think that they did this consistently.  There just don\'t seem to be enough
class "B" stars in the Imperium.  Also, the handful of supergiants I found
in the UWPs didn\'t seem to match well.  So I moved on to trying to figure
out where some particular stars "should" be found on the map, more or less.
 
When I was deciding where certain stars "should" be, I used several methods.
For stars near Terra, I depended on UWP spectral classes from the GEnie data.
I tried to keep constellations together...for instance, I decided that
Dingir should be 40 Eridani because the stars were right and the direction
from terra was close to that of Epsilon Eridani.  Sometimes, if a star was
very close to another in the sky that had an official location, I tried to
place it on a "line" very roughly through it from Earth.  Otherwise, I
compared it to a map of "galactic longitude" in _Norton\'s_, which shows
the night sky with the Milky Way as the equator. 

Spectral classes of stars if given with a Traveller hex are the ones in
the sector data, otherwise they are the ones in reference books.  Names
in curly braces are alternate star names, usually the one which identifies
it in its constellation.  Names in plain text are the most common name for
stars that do not have a proper name, or are identified by a mainworld
name in Traveller.  If the system has a Traveller name like "Beta Cygni-2",
it wasn\'t retyped to remove the number.

A/B suffix means that the star is in a binary system.  AB suffix means the star
has a close companion that can\'t be distinguished from it.

Denebola       A3V.  Somewhere in Alpha Crucis subsector I (Denebola).
Aldebaran      K5III.  Somewhere in Aldebaran subsector B (Aldebaran).
                       Possibly Home/Aldebaran?  (Just a wild guess).
Canopus        F0Ib.  Somewhere in Canopus sector.

"Official" Star Systems in question:

R\'bak         (1314 Reft)      G3V.  Possibly Rukbat {Alpha Sagittarii}.
              Located alone in Sagittarian subsector.  Judging by Sector
              library data, a homage to Anne McCaffrey\'s world "Pern".
              If so, her Pern did orbit Rukbat.
Beta Cygni-4  (3006 Ilelish)   M0V MOD.  Should be K3II with binary. Angle OK.
              Distance not checked.  Also called "Albireo".
Gamma Lupus-2 (2104 Ilelish)   M7V.  Should be B2V, and position is wrong.  
Mizar-5       (1011 OldExp)    K0V.  Should be A2V, and position is wrong.
Theta Borealis.  Sector name.  There is no constellation "Borealis".  Could
              possibly be a eventual shortening of "Corona Borealis", then
              its position may also be OK.
Sigma Zephyrus.  Sector name.  There is no constellation "Zephyrus".  At

              sized nebula in their version of "Vanguard Reaches" sector.
              Whether it\'s still there is unknown.

Possible Stars for some systems:

Junction     (1929 SolRim)   M6V       Wolf 359
Peraspera    (2028 SolRim)   M5V       Lalande 21185

Dingir       (1222 SolRim)   K0V M1D   40 Eridani A/B
Markhashi    (1529 SolRim)   M5V M6V   UV Ceti A/B  (maybe not, is flare star)

Undetermined Nearby Supergiants:

Eakhoi       (2123 DkNebula) F8Ia      (Polaris?  Is a bit too close to Terra.)
Sardas       (0839 Mendan)   F0Ib M7D
             (1530 EmptyQtr) M4Ia M4D

Stars of spectral class O9 or greater with Terran app.magn. brighter than 3.5: 

Mintaka           O9II   (binary)  far to rimward-trailing (400-600pcs)
Iota Orionis AB   O9III  (binary)  "
Lambda Orionis AB O8?    (trinary) "
Alnitak           09Ib   (binary)  "
Zeta Puppis       O5Ia?            far to trailing (750pcs)
Zeta Ophiuchi     O9V    (solo)    Lishun sector?  (At same range as Antares)
Gamma Velorum A/B WC7 07?          rimward-trailing Centrax sector*

  *This star system is particularly interesting.  Gamma Velorum A, or Regor,
   is one of only about 130 "Wolf-Rayet" stars in our galaxy.  Essentially,
   this is a decidedly unstable type O star that is driving out large masses
   of hydrogen to expose parts of its core.  This star could explode into
   a nova at some time in the future.  By a quirk of astrography, it is only
   a handful of parsecs from the Hive Federation capital, Glea.
       The Hivers don\'t have official "travel zones", but this system would
   probably be equivalent to an amber zone, and also be a "Fascinating"
   system, on the basis of the star alone. 

Some objects to watch for:

Regulus       B7V.  Probably somewhere in Aldebaran Sector, range 25pcs.
Betelgeuse    M2Ia. Probably in sector 7,1 (one rimward from RimReach).
Rho Ophiuchi Dark Cloud.  Collection of nebulae.  Probably in coreward
              Trenchan Sector.  

There are two interstellar governments in Malorn Sector, the "Daprolix
Juncture of Suns" and "Bright Star Cooperate", that are adjacent and along
a line which includes two clusters of bright stars, the Hyades (40pcs.) and
the Pleiades (120pcs.), clusters containing hundreds of stars in a few
parsecs!  The problem is, the cluster shown is at *80 parsecs*, so it\'s
right between them.  Your guess is as good as mine which one it is.

Nice idea, but you had to think of the structural support of your armor. While
the ship is small, you only need small amounts of strutural support, because
the hull is stable. If the hull gets bigger, the armor is thick as before, but
its stability is weaker. So you had to support the hull.
These supports will fill the gap between High Guard and your calculation.

 I\'ll say.  I never got into as much trouble as I did on the torg board
when I started thinking about falling damage.


[] I worked out the ship and armor volume of three different ships,
[]with the armor staying constant in thickness (300mm of WHATEVER). However,
[]to simplify things, I assumed that the ships were box-like, and I did not
[]subtract overlapping volumes (I wasn\'t in the mood for the math involved,
[]and it just means that the armor is listed as taking more space than it really
[]does; as you will see, this DOES NOT hurt the conclusion).

- -- tables deleted --

I did much the same thing some time ago, also checking my conclusions with
spherical hulls.  In essense, as dimensions are scaled, volume is cubed and
surface area is squared.  Since Armor is based on surface area, the
overall result (if looking at volume) is that armor volume (if thickness
remains the same) is about a .66667 power operation.  That is...

     Armor Vol = Scale ^ 0.6667

Using 100t ships as a base, use tonnage/100 as the scale.  Thus a 1000t
ship sould not have 10 times the weight of armor, but instead only 4.64 times
the weight (assuming configuration is the same).

If reasonable conversions from an "ideal" form can be calculated, (i.e. 
if spherical configs = x1, box = x1.3, etc), then a more accurate portrayal
of armor can be gained.

How true (sigh!). Still, at least you might use the lure of the stars as
an excuse. With a 1MCr annuity of 1 or 2 % you don\'t get enough to travel
at will among the stars. I suspect, however, that most PCs (and most free
traders) will get their ships second (or third or tenth) hand. In any case
I\'d like to keep the cost of civilian ships down as much as possible (while
making warships as expensive as possible  -  that\'s the dillema).

I\'m not saying that pirates ought to be able to stand up to the Navy.
But if the average pirate can deal with a Gazelle, then the Navy will
need to use Chrysanthemums to patrol, which more than halves the number
of patrols they can afford. If the average pirate can deal with a
Chrysanthemum, then the Navy will need to use Sloans and so on. The
problem is that the bigger a pirate becomes, the bigger prey it needs
and the bigger nuisance it becomes, so there is a limit to how big they
can become.

You\'re wrong when you assume that merchant traffic will collapse unless
the Navy can suppress piracy. On the contrary, piracy is self-regulating.
If it becomes too great a burden on trade, then the number of merchants
will decrease, true, but then the number of pirates will dwindle too,
whereupon merchant traffic will pick up, which will allow the piracy
traffic to pick up too, etc. etc.. You can\'t _have_ pirates without trade
to prey on. And when the potential profit outweighs the risks, merchants
will be out there trading, pirates or no pirates.

You\'re right in saying that any government will try to suppress piracy
(unless properly licenced ;-), because any profits will be greater
without piracy-caused overheads, but a government will not necessarily
suppress it totally. If they have the means to they will, of course, but
the (political) cost of actually building more ships is an immidiate one
(increased taxes, which the government will be blamed for), while the
benefit of getting rid of pirates will only appear later, and will often
not be credited to the government, but simply taken for granted. Thus
extra money will not be available unless the pirates are such a nuisance
that pressure is brought on the government by the merchant community.

Look at history. It\'s only in the last two centuries that piracy has really
been brought under control, chiefly because the various government fleets
finally became big and/or efficient enough to make piracy unprofitable (and
even today we sometimes hear of pirate-style robberies). Certainly the 16th
17th and 18th Centuries (where the great trading companies flourished) had
their share of pirates as well as national fleets.

No, pirates need to be able to hide from government fleets, which is
not quite the same. The whole problem arises out of the fact that it
_is_ the same in the Traveller universe as it is now (because the
Navy is big enough to patrol all systems adequately at all times),
so what Bertil and I want is to reduce the size of the Navy.

Never worked that way on pre-spaceflight Terra. Merchant traffic will
cease only when it becomes unprofitable and pirates can\'t make trade
unprofitable (unless state-subsidized).

We seem to have read different history books ;-) Try one about the
Caribbean and see how long it took from the first government attempt
to suppress piracy until the last pirate was caught.

Only if the Navy can find them. The problem is that there aren\'t all
that many areas to patrol and more than enough Navy ships to patrol
them. Pirates can rely on disguise to keep them safe between strikes
(looking like innocent merchants), but that dosen\'t help if there\'s
warship within range when the pirate actually attacks its prey.

Yes and no. It is limited by the amount of money that the citizenry is
willing to or can be coreced into spending. Look at what happened after
the Peace of Amiens. Most military men and quite a few politicians knew
that they would most likely be at war with Napoleon again as soon as he
had had time to rebuild his forces, and yet the government reduced the
navy to its peacetime complement. Why? Not because they didn\'t need the
ships, but because people refused to keep up paying an income tax of four
shilling in the pound.

>It was always limited by NEED.

Yes, but you don\'t need to eradicate piracy to keep commerce flowing,
just to keep it within bounds.

You can spend money you don\'t have, but only to get ressources on credit.
You can\'t use ressources you can\'t get. I won\'t belabour this point
though, because it\'s obvious that the Imperium could afford a lot more
than it curently does (_Striker_ talks of 3% of GNP (rising to 15% in
wartime) and we\'ve examples of far more than that in history). What we
have to stick to is that the 3% represents the amount that is politically
feasible to use (and as I\'ve written earlier, I\'m working on a way to
reduce that for high-population worlds). So the problem is: Given a fixed
budget, how can we reduce the size of the Imperial Fleet to something that
will allow pirates to survive on frontier worlds?

Ah, but in TCS my century-old ships dose not become decrepit. That\'s
what I mean when I write that it is ostensible the same ships, but that
it can\'t really be. I repeat: TCS assumes both things.

Inflation happens because you CAN\'T do things like that, but governments
think you can ;-).

Seriously, if you look behind the GNP to the actual ressources that are
there, you will run into a genuine limit. Unfortunately not enough to solve
our problem though, so I have to fall back on a political explanation: The
3% spent on military forces represents what it\'s politically feasible to
spend. If that\'s insufficient to provide a fleet that can supress piracy
totally, then that\'s just too bad ;-)

    I hope this was some kind of joke?  Deficit spending is done by the
government borrowing money and/or selling bonds that they cannot
reasonably expect to pay without borrowing.  The amount of actual
cash money that is printed by the government has nothing to do with
either its income or its outlay, especially in a modern economy where
90+% of all government transactions are either electronic or paper
(not cash) transactions.  In point of fact, I believe the actual
amount of cash money in circulation has been dropping, as the government
prints/coins less than it destroys as outdated and estimates is lost/
destroyed in private hands.  Inflation and deficit spending are linked,
true, but neither has anything to do with printing money.

  How about the convoy tactic? Or \'defended sealine\'? This could be 
realized in Traveller by putting three of my \'stronger than the pirates\' 
military ships at each main world and at one gas giant in each system:
One ship would guard a \'jump point\' where the merchants jump in and out,
one would guard the mainworld or gasgiant and the third would escort them
between the point and the mainworld/gasgiant.
  
  The number of vessels that is needed to eliminate piracy is reached by
assuming one mainworld and one gasgiant in each system, each having three
ships to handle the merchants. This would be 62982 ships. Counting 2/3rds on
station at each given moment this increase to 94473 ships. 
  But some systems lack a gasgiant, some mainworlds are moons of gasgiants and
so on, which would reduce it to (wild estimate) 70000 ships, many more if
the ships arn\'t 100% \'pirate proof\'.

  If we go below that number, wider and wider areas of the Imperium will begin
to become open to the pirates, and unprotected systems would probably be
posted by the TAS. I\'m not sure how to factor in protection against outside
agression into this, that would increase the number of ships and their size
somewhat (to say the least:)

  The Gross Imperial Product is 219,474,958,700,000,000 Credits (courtesy of
Wildstar). This is the value of everything that is produced in the Imperium
each year. This must then also be the *absolute* top figure on how much
the Imperium can spend on anti-piracy ships.
  I\'m assuming that each ship lasts 40 years and that crew costs are 50% of
the budget. This is a low estimate: The Swedish defence budget is about 60%
wages despite the fact that all conscripts go on $4 to $25 per day.
  This will lead to a expenditure of 25% of the full price of the ships
for each ship each year (10% base, 40 years life is 1/40th per year: 2.5%,
12.5% doubled is 25%.) 
  The maximum cost of each one of those 70000 ships would then be 1.25E13 Cr or
12.5 Teracredits. A suitable ship is the Sun Tzu cruiser, which cost GCr31.
The relationship between max ship cost and real ship cost for 70000 Sun Tzus 
is 404.
  But the Imperium cannot spend 100% of its GIP on anti-piracy ships, going 
from Terran history I would put the top limit on defence spending at 30% GIP.
So if the entire military budget is spent on buying anti-piracy ships they 
will have 120 times as much as needed. 
  A likelier percentage of anti-piracy vice other military work is 25/75, then
they would have 30 times as much as needed. So if we make all military ships
50 times as expensive, they will have to cut down on either anti-zhodani or
anti-piracy work.

  And when the pirates are gone, trade will commence again and so on.

  This is not a fixed state: It is a cycle just like the rabbit population 
and given the normal amount of referee freedom we can choose where on
this cycle the Imperium is depending on the level of piracy we want. It is 
probably dependent on the frontier wars, by the way: When the navy is occupied
kicking the zhodanis around, or replacing destroyed ships in the Marches by
depleting the fleet in their own sector piracy goes up.

> In that case, use bigger nukes.

  I don\'t have a killpound table handy, but there is a limit on how big a 
nuke one can cram into a 100kg 15cm missile, and it is smaller than the
nuke one can cram into a 400kg(?) 25cm missile which in turn is smaller than
that in a 65cm missile.

  Will it be Traveller? I\'ve seen more persons using the Traveller background
with other rules than the Traveller rules with other backgrounds so I am
forced to look upon \'Traveller\' as a setting more than a set of rules.

  Isn\'t GNP the value of all goods and services produced during one year?
If the military spending is equal to the GNP it means that any and all work
done is done for a directly military purpose. Not a centicred goes to growing
food or sweeping the streets or to health care or to educating children.
How can the Imperium go above this unless by buying ships from outside 
sources?

  Deficit spending is the government spending more than what the government
\'earns\' from taxes. But taxes are just a percentage of the GNP, so it isn\'t
a case of the government spending more than the GNP.

  I checked the Fire Control difficulties table in MegaT, and it revealed
an interesting thing: Even at hight TLs it isn\'t easy to hit a target at 
5 to 50km range and close to impossible at 50-500km. If we accept
this, and factor in the movement DMs, it will be very hard for the navy to 
hit a Gravtank at all. One could make a case for the tank being treated as a
fighter, but it would have to be above the ground clutter for that, so 
the threat of an orbital navy against NOE tanks is not that high.

  Not really. 10000 meters will make it possible to mount PD on the
bottom of the tank, thus removing the threat from missiles and nukes. PAs
will still don\'t work. But remember the difficulty in hitting: Non-missile
weapons would have a hard time hitting *if we accept these difficulties*.

  If we on the other hand think that it is too difficult to hit, and that
we should factor in the computer and similar things, it will lend more
credibility to the pancake theory since the ranges are much longer than
5000m, (The tank is operating in the middle of the 10000m thick pancake)
(I\'m basing this on Striker with its saner model of penetration attenuation):
  Fusionguns have ranges of 11 to 30km and lasers of 50 to 250km. If we up the
power to penetrate the armour, we will get even longer ranges.

  Imagine the savings in weight and cost if one could reduce the belly

  But even if you put, say 300mm of armour plate on all faces of an M1, 
assuming that the weight don\'t make it unable to move, it will have a thicker
effective armour thickness on some faces due to the slant of those faces.
  If the glacis slants at 45 degrees it will have an effective armour
thickness of around 400mm if my calculator isn\'t decieving me.

  The same reasoning holds true for gravtanks unless they look like spheres:
Equal thickness all around give unequal armour protection depending on face
hit and angle of hit.

  If I believed in them in the second way (cancel all inertia of the whole 
ship even structural components) any ship in the Imperium would go like
greased lightning if they put normal (chemical or fusion) rockets on them:
  The power to weight relationship would approach infinity as weight 
(seen as inertia) approached zero.

  For once, some of them has more HUDs than crew, and the listed missile

violated their own armour rules among other things.

  Well, that is *one* reason why MTBFs must be longer for aircrafts and 
real-life space equipment (where you can\'t make repairs on the fly) than for
ships, but isn\'t the other reason that any failure can have immediately 
disastrous effects for aerospace vehicles?
  An aircraft having an engine failure is more likely to be lost than a
ship having an engine failure, all other factors being equal.

This is mostly true.  But if the pirate is big anough and tough
enough,it\'s prey becomes frontier worlds, not ships.  And all the
anlysis I ever did assumed SEH-class light cruisers numbered in the
100,000s in the Imperium.  I haven\'t even gotten down to the Sloan or
Chrysnthemum level yet.  Start counting at millions and work up.

Of course merchant traffic won\'t really collapse.  What will really
happen is that the merchants will arm their ships to the point that they
can deal with pirates, or force the Navy to deal with them.

Chiefly because piracy became impossible when a pirate required coal to
make his ship go.  When you go to get coal, they arrest you.  Piracy is
a trivial problem now, and that is more due to other factors.

No, pirates need to be able to operate in the target areas, and get
somewhere for maintenance and resale of loot.  MT\'s Jump technology
limits the pirate\'s ability to operate far from a refuge world.

Piracy was never much of a problem on pre-spaceflight Terra.  Something
to do with the trivial cost of a ship, and the EXTREMELY high profits to
be made from even one successful voyage.  When one successful voyage
will replace the ship that failed to come home, piracy can remove 50% of
all shipping without affecting shipping volume.  When a voyage brings
home 0.25% of the cost of a ship, then even a small amount of piracy
will be lethal to trade.

I know about the Caribbean pirates.  How many of them were operating
under a Letter of Marque and Reprisal from one European country or
another.  In virtually every case of persistent piracy in this world,
the "pirates" were essentially foreign warships operating against
merchant shipping.

MOST ships in MT (Jump-capable ones at least) are never more than 100
diameters from the main world of a system.  If you check, you will find
that 12 warships can be deployed so that that ENTIRE VOLUME can be
brought under fire at any time.  ANd it is hard to disguise a ship as an
"innocent merchant" that carries a fusion plant big enough to fight off
a Sloan.  These things are noticable by Customs inspectors, as well as
System Defense Squadrons.

Again, I concede the point.  My example was from US history alone. 
There are, in fact, examples of abject stupidity in every country and at
every time in the history of the world.

I admit that you cannot buy what does not exist.  However, deficit
spending is not just a matter of buying things on credit.  It is a
matter of creating money where none existed before.  Look at economic
history.
 
The surest way to destroy piracy, uncer the conditions you aim for, is
to let Navy ships operate far from TL15 worlds.  As it stands now,
piracy should be a major problem in Jewell Subsector (FAR form the Navy,
so few patrols, and CLOSE to the Zhos, so a safe haven nearby), and Five
Sisters, for similar reasons.  I know the Zhos won\'t want pirates in
their systems, but as long as you are a good boy in Zho space, they
probably won\'t bother fixing an Impy problem, and sure the Imperium
isn\'t going to start the Sixth Frontier War just to chase a few
moth-eaten pirates.
 
If you want piracy to flourish, keep the Impy ships close to home, and
far from the frontier.  Shorten the maintenance cycle, rather than
lengthening it.  Keep a lot of Navy ships in yards being upgraded to
state-of-the-art.  That way they are on Glisten/Mora/Rhylanor/Trin as
opposed to the frontiers.
 
 
>Ah, but in TCS my century-old ships dose not become decrepit. That\'s
>what I mean when I write that it is ostensible the same ships, but that

TCS ignores the question of ship aging, and MT and TCS both ignore the
question of technological advancement.  These are defects in the
system.  They do NOT assume both things, they merely ignore certain
CRUCIAL elements of reality.

A better way of phrasing that is that you can\'t but Governments do

I do not believe in ANY resource limit to TL15 cultures.  One lousy
asteroid can provide all the steel you\'ll need for any normal usage. 
The total complement of an asteroid belt will provide for ANY
concievable fleet production.  Robots can be built without limit, so
fleets can be as big as you want them to be.  BUT, the money question,
while meaningless, can be played up if the powers-that-be want to do
so.  Unfortunately, that provides for a fleet that can deal with any
problem short of government-sponsered piracy.  And it can probably deal
with them, too.
 
How about this as a solution?  Someone (who knows who?  the Shadow?)
drops an asteroid on Ruie (no-one will care that it is missing, it has
no effect on any campaign I have ever seen), and destroys civilization
there.  The governments of the Imperial worlds decide that that is a
danger, and insist that the Imperium keep enough hardware in each system
to deal with the potential threat.  The Navy sets up skywatches in all
Hi Pop systems, but has insufficent forces to do so throughout the
Imperium.  Too bad.  The remaining unprotected worlds make up less than
3% of the population, so their protests are drowned out by the sighs of
relief from the Hi Pop systems.  Piracy flourishes, frontiers become a
little wilder.  All them good GMs and players are happy.
PS.  It was, in fact, a cosmic coincidence that this happened, and it
will never happen again in the course of the next 50,000 game years.

promise not to attack *that* empire\'s shipping, the ship is handed over to

that, for example, the Zhodani can raid Imperial shipping without using their
own warships and crews. 

One little comment on pirates: traditionally, the pre-19th century pirates
would NOT kill a ship\'s crew, or even rob the individual crewmen, if the
crew surrendered without a fight. Many times, the pirates wouldn\'t even take
the ship, and even if they did, they made sure to land the crew on an island
with provisions. It should be noted that such merchant ships were owned by
companies, and thus the crews were just employees. However, many merchant
craft in Traveller are privately owned; either the pirates will have to go
in expecting a fight or will leave the independants alone. MY pirates (most
of them anyway) would rather not fight unless they have to, so will prefer
the company ships.

Hi There...  I\'m back after a 8 month hiatus from the network...

SUBJECT:  TCS Discussions

I\'m excited by the discussions about TCS.  Does this mean that people are
playing it, or are interested in playing it?  Anyone want to play over the net?

SUBJECT:  Pirates

I\'m a firm believer that Pirates will always exist given: A: something worth
stealing, and B: someplace to hide.  I guess everyone here knows that \'space is
big, *really* big\'.  No Matter *HOW* big the Imperial Fleet it, there will be
someplace to hide, especially with being able to pop out with the jump drive.
No Fleet is big enough to search all of space and worlds within say jump 6,
including empty space in between systems, the best place for pirate bases.

Anyways, I doubt that chasing pirates is an *Imperial* Fleet job.  And any ship
over 2,000 Tons  OT or so will be overkill;  A 100,000 Ton will not be very
usefull in a search and destroy.  Maybe the Destroy part, but by then the
pirates will be long gone.  Most likely dealing with pirates will be left to
the locals, a Coast Guard equivilent or some such.

I can make a bigger case for pirates not having anything worthwhile to steal.
If the average free merchant can\'t make ends meet, what makes you think that
a pirate can.  Sure, pirate cargos are \'free\', but you do have very frequent,
very expensive repairs to your ships.

If anyone remembers the discussions a year ago on trade, I argued that trade
would be only of exceptional items which cannot be produced locally, rather
then of run of the mill commodities, spacefaring being so expensive.  We have
run of the mill shipping today, because it\'s ...  well, run of the mill,
common, boring and cheap.  If you want star travel to be adventurous, it will
be expensive and exceptional.

The only piracy I could ever justify, given the high cost of shipping was,
piracy of shipping, hijacking et al.  The best payoff was to hijack a ship from
within.  The second was to have a big enough ship, and attack a small enough
ship so as to cow your victim into surrendering, and be able to jump out with a
whole, or nearly whole ship.  If they put up a big enough fight, and you have
to disable it, you better have a big enough hold to hold it, or some way to
jump it out as dead weight.  Otherwise, you will only get whatever you can
strip from it in the few hours you have before reinforcement come.

Of course, safe traders will stay near the jump point if there is a designated
one, and near the main planet, and *maybe* the gass giant, where the navy/coast
guard/high guard is.  These traders will be virtually safe from random piracy,
but not as chosen targets if word gets out that they have a certain cargo
someone wants badly.  Any ships that go outside of these protected spots will
be fair game.  And there will be some, occasionally who are in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

I view pirates as being a pretty much opportunistic, if they are in the right
place at the right time with the right victim, they attack.  They don\'t
generally wait in a particular place waiting for a target.  If it\'s a place
heavily travelled enough to make it worthwhile for them to wait, pretty soon it
will be worthwhile for to be protected.  Of course it\'s a dance, where the
traders try to find safe passage, pirates try to find targets in weak spots of
the defense, and the government tries to shore up weak spots.

Hmmm... So starships cannot hit a 10 ton tank at 500Km, but can hit a
ten ton fighter at 500,000Km.  Odd.
As to the question of ground clutter, look up the description of the
densitometer.  Artificial grav fields at range less than 50,000Km stand
out quite clearly.  Ground clutter is meaningless against grav tanks.

An odd picture, but perfectly true, all the same.  I concede the point. 
However you inadvertently made MY point:  that it is safer to be at
altitude than at NOE.
 
 
{more discussion of the "pancake}
 
BTW, the pncake has one serious flaw:  curvature of the planet limits
the effective side of the pancake to no more than 5 or so Km, unless the
tanks are operating at altitude.  So the "pancake" doesn\'t actually

You are showing your track-layer prejudices again.  If you can fly, you
can choose an altitude where your shot falls at the most advantageous
(to you) angle.  Then armour sloping becomes much more problematic, and
design theory would probably consist of determining optimum slope to
convince your enemy to move to a position (relative to you) that makes
HIm more vulnerable.  Sounds like fun...

Power to weight ratio (though MT loves teh concept) is meaningless.  The
correct concept is "power to MASS ratio".  Even if weight is zero, mass
is still there.

Good points.  Though their missile usage may be based on Referee\'s Guide
before the Errata.  I noticed the HUD problem myself last night on the
Vargr ships in Rebellion Sourcebook.  I suspect this has something to do
with the fact that the various controls DON\'T DO ANYTHING other than
contribute to CP totals.  Something needs to be done (at least
informally) to regulate the use of controls of various types.  No more
than one HUD per workstation, or whatever.  For that matter, why can\'t a
ship have large numbers of computers, so ships don\'t need to be limited
by Computer CP limits?

Too true.  But a starship in space is in less danger from engine failure
than a surface ship.  Very little out there to hit, and you aren\'t
likely to need the engine for quite some time.

The phrase "print money" is a figure of speech, based on the bad old
days of the sixties when the government did, in fact, print more money. 
Any process whereby a government spends money it doesn\'t have, and can\'t
get, can be described that way.  BTW, I noticed in the newspaper
yesterday that the Russians were going to deal with an expected revenue
shortfall by (in the words of their spokesman) "printing more money".

The "jumppoiny is a myth.  Properly, it is the surface of a sphere of
radius 100 planetary diameters.  It would take considerably more than
one ship to defend same (perhaps 12, as I said earlier (for a world, a
gas giant would require thousands).
I take it you have little enough traffic that convoying daily traffic
with one ship is possible.  In our game, the level of merchant traffic
is measured in thousands of ships per day to most non-backwaters.
Under that kind of load, escort duties could only be met by hundreds of
ships per world.

And if we make automobiles fifty times as expensive, people will stop
buying them.  Of course, the pirates will then cost fifty times as much,
too.  If they don\'t, then they are built like merchant ships, and a
Naval vessel that could fight them could be built that way, too.  Then
the price of anti-piracy operations drop by a factor of 50, and the
Imperial merchants breathe a collective sigh of relief.

No.  If you are forced by "other concerns" to build a grav unit factory
on your own planet, then when the pirates are gone, why would you shut
it down and start importing them?  Once your indigenous industry can
build something, importing it becomes a waste.  Therefore, after the
pirates go away, trade will remain virtually non-existant.

Too true.  But I don\'t believe in 100Kg missiles that can cross
500,000Km at 6Gs, either.  Using MT design rules, a missile that could
do that will either be MUCH bigger, or MUCH more expensive and only
three or four times as big.  In any case, by the time you finish
building a missile of the correct size, you will notice that it has room
for a Minuteman RV as a warhead.

Actually true.  Notice that creative bookkeeping can fix that.  By
mass-producing money, and importing with this phony money before
inflation devalues the currency into trivia, the government can
certainly fake it quite well for a time.  A short time. 
However, see my opinion about the resource limits on the Imperium for my
own belifs on the matter.
BTW, I do NOT believe that this solution (deficit spending) is useful. 
I DO belive that governments throughout history have used that method of
stealing from their citizens and other countries.

Halving the number of ship works better (though not well). Jump-4 ships
can get from Jewell to Rhylanor and from Iderati to Glisten in less than
six weeks. That means 3/4 of a fleet is available for patrol duty at all
times, even in Jewell and Five Sisters. And the ships going back and forth
can do a spot of patrolling on the way to and from refitting. That makes
Lanth and District 268 some of the _best_ patrolled area in the Marches!

Well, since I\'ve always assumed that navy ships could refit at naval bases
(and this is also the impression one gets from other Traveller material  -
look at the piece about naval bases in _Fighting Ships_ for example), that
is one "solution" I hadn\'t even contemplated. I have now, and no thanks.
I\'d like a half-way believable explanation, please. If I\'d been satisfied
with an explanation to the effect that a tech-15 culture can\'t make things
that can survive more than a few months without servicing, I\'d have chosen
something even easier and just as believable (like the merchant fleet uses
up nearly all the lanthanum, and there\'s very little left over for the
navies (how\'s that for a clever explanation? ;-)). An explanation that
makes naval ships _worse_ than civilian ships is no help at all...

I think we\'re both arguing the same side of the issue. Wether TCS makes

Whoa there! Let\'s not destroy the Traveller universe completely! Forget
unlimited selfreproducing robots. If you allow them, you might as well
roll up the universe and carry it away. If that means we have to believe
an impossible thing or two more, so be it. A culture who can build self-
reproducing robots would be nice to live in (I\'d be able to play games all
the time and let the robots worry about the food and rent), but it would be
a lousy place to game in. Soething like that "Safe at any speed" story by
Larry Niven. Repeat after me: "There are limits to ressources in all
Traveller societies! There are limits..."

If they have unlimited selfreproducing robots they just ask the robots to
build some more ships. Not that they would need to, since everybody would
be so well off that they wouldn\'t need to become pirates in the first place!

But changing the way the military budget is divided between System,
Subsector and Imperial Navy might help. I\'ve been using 1/3 each, so
changing that to 1/2, 1/4, 1/4 or something could help a bit.

Good point. I hadn\'t considered that. Sigh! On the other hand, one

What has that got to do with it? At the very least there was one
government after them (Spain), and that government fleet were too
small to deal with them. And no, they didn\'t shelter behind another
country\'s fleet, because for long stretches of time neither England,
France or Holland had any warships in the Carribean at all.

I\'m talking about the early period, of course, and it didn\'t matter
wether Spain was at war or not, the Spanish navy was unable to deal
with the Caribbean pirates. Later English, French and Dutch (and
Danish ;-) warships did roam the Carribean trying to suppress the
pirates in the intervals between wars. And they did not increase
their fleet to meet the pirate menace, they tried to control it
with what ships they had.

I have to disagree most strongly here. It\'s true that lots of pirates
tried to hide behind letters of marque (often having a set from each
beligerent), which tended to give privateers a bad name, but there was a
great distinction between them. Privateers that were known to stick to
privateering were tolerated by their friends and might even survive
being captured by the enemy. A pirate would be hunted down by both sides.

Yes, that\'s what I meant. Sorry if I was unclear. That means we need to
reduce the part of the fleet that is not protecting the high-population
worlds to les than 24 ships per system (mainworld and gas giant).

Unless the Imperium makes fusion plants above a certain size illegal,

Oh, I can give you an example from US history too :-). After the War of
Independence Congress was reluctant to allow the establishment of a
big fleet for fear of creating a military caste. They thus refused
to allow any Ships of the Line and only 10 frigates. Fortunately
they forgot to specify price and dimensions, so the master shipwright
made the frigates as large as he possibly could and still call it a
frigate with scantlings more appropiate for Line-of-Battle Ship.
Nevertheless the fleet proved unable to protect American shipping
during the War of 1812.

As to your piracy comments, I agree with almost averything (for once). 
You overlooked the need for maintenance in your assertions about pirate
basing:  it doesn\'t matter how big space is if there are only 12 worlds
in the sector that can do annual overhaul on your ship - you\'ll have to
be one of those places sooner or later.

True.  However, halving 5,000,000 anti-piracy ships to 2,500,000 is not
really any help either.

I agree here.  Notice that I assume that society still plays monetary
games so as to ARTIFICIALLY limit resources.  Yes, I made the comment
that you responded to, but I am willing to argue a point from internal
logic without reference to Gaming logic:  It SHOULD be true at TL15.  It
makes a lousy game so it\'s not, but it SHOULD be.

Check background material:  The existing split should be 70% system, 30%
split between subsector and Imperial navies, in whatever ratio is
convenient (slightly less to the Impy Navy, since TL15 ships cost less
than TL13 ships do).
 
 
>Good point. I hadn\'t considered that. Sigh! On the other hand, one

No.  The pirate has some expensive repairs to make fairly regularly. 
His maintenance facility is not nearby, so he has to make regular LONG
transits with no income (it wouldn\'t do to give the Impy computers
enough data to guess where you get your ship overhauled).  The pirate
will need to make a lot of hits during the period he is on station to
make ends meet.  If he takes out one ship in three hundred, then
Imperial trade will collapse.

At the very least, it gave them a safe place to buy new cannons.  You
don\'t have to shelter behind their fleet, you have to shelter in their
harbors.

Depends on how you define "pirate" I suppose.  The British (during the
Napoleanic Wars) did not issue Letters of Marque, and did not respect
them.  The French did.  The Americans did.  Notice that the highest
levels of piracy in history were during wars, and caused by the
privateers of one side.  Invariably the other side called them
"pirates".  The writers of Histories called them whichever their own
prejudices lent them to.

Less than 24 ships per system.  For the Spinward Marches, that comes to
less than 6528 ships.  Trin/Mora/Glisten/Rhylanor can support (by
themselves) a force of 15000 Sloan class ships, ignoring system defense
squadrons.  BTW, all my assertions about Imperial Fleet size have
assmued the discussion was ONLY the Imperial fleet, at 0.63% of the
GWP.  System squadrons should be based on 1.26% of GWP, and so should be
twice as big as the Imperial Navy.  Getting the defensive forces down to
24 ships per system will be PRETTY TRICKY.  (I also seem to recall from
FFW, that many systems had system squadrons of 120+ ships.  Efate and
Louzy and Rhylanor and Porozlo had thousands apiece.  So the Navy can
let the population 8+ systems patrol themselves, and just worry about
the frontiers.  Yet another obstacle... (*sigh*)

Sure, they can call the Navy and tell them, and the Navy can send a
cruiser around to escort them while in system.  They can check the black
box for tampering, and arrest them if the black box sn\'t clean.  They
can use all those obscure regulations that no one ever pays attention to
to harass them, and look for any escuse possible to put them away. 
Remember that Al Capone was busted for tax-evasion.  They can find
SOMETHING to get these guys on.

As you pointed out elsewhere, you could need a 1000 ships to guard a gas
giant. That would help, right? Not to mention the trip from the gas giant
to the mainworld. Especially if there is an asteroid belt between them.

Well, I\'ve always regarded population 8+ worlds as off limit to piracy
anyway (provided they have a reasonable tech level, natch). Still, with
only one planet in six being pop. 8+ there\'s still lots of systems for
pirates to haunt. The problem remains the regular and reserve navies.

>[About the problems of disguising a pirate as a merchant]

I still think that part is not such a great problem. Still, even if you\'re
right, there\'s nothing to stop the pirates _being_ merchant ships and then
hunting in packs. The pirate ships would individually be as weak as the next
merchant, but a group of 4 or 6 could still capture it (in fact, in some ways
they would be better suited than a single large ship).

Are you sure about this? I remember once trying to work out the annual
return on a subsidized liner, and I got the figure of 3%. Not that I
mightn\'t\'ve worked out my sums wrong, I admit. But didn\'t we decide a few
months ago that the 2000 Cr per week overhead on occupied cabins were
silly? That will help the budget a bit. And then there\'s speculative
trade. My own experience with speculative trade was with the basic
book 2 rules, so things may be different with MegaTraveller, but I
remember myself and 3 fellow players making ourself billionaires in just
3 evenings play. It was all a matter of having enough capital. Mind you,
the referee played strictly by the book and let us get away with quite
ridiculous things (hey, we were young back then ;-). His initial
mistake, for example, was to allow us to unload 89 computers at 300%
on a population 4 planet. I\'ve often wondered what they wanted the
things for... (No, come to think of it, his very first mistake was to
offer us as many computers as we could afford at 30% standard price
when we had the cash to buy two; we then took a small loan with our
ship as collatteral and bought as many as our hold could hold :-).

Be that as it may, my impression is that you can make some pretty hefty
profits with a starship if you have the capital. Has this all changed
with MegaTraveller?

Just to throw another spanner in the works...wouldn\'t a system that lacked
the 1000 ships/gas giant get around the problem by defining a few jump points
around the GG that were protected by ships.  Thus, any merchant that desired
some kind of safety could use the official jump points and be quite safe all
the time they were in system.  Ships jumping into the system had better
make sure that they jump in quite close to the recoginised points.  I assume
that jumps that precise are possible ---- how else would jumps in formation
be possible???  Using this system would also make the job of the customs
people easier.  Board random ships that arrive normally.  Board all ships that
arrive elsewhere.  Shoot down all ships leaving abnormally :-)
IMHO, customs people boarding ships is silly.  Inspect them after they land
and if they attempt to land away from a starport, blow them away.  You might
have guessed that I believe in quite draconian methods of law enforcement.

I believe Striker is intended for use with miniatures, and operates on a
scale of 1/1000.  Ranges, burst sizes etc. are always given in cm as
measured on the game table.  So that burst size translates as 100m.

Why didn\'t they just give all ranges in mm (game), which would be equal
to m (real)?  :-(

Wait!  If you cancel all inertia, wouldn\'t you get light pressure effects?  I
can see it now...your grav tank is cruising along on the night side of a planet
when it crosses the terminator and suddenly it\'s going slower than it was!
Then as you get closer and closer to noon, you get forced closer to the ground!
Of course when the sun is behind you, you speed up!

drive...Dive toward the sun, turn it on, and presto, change-o, you are
instantly going the other direction at just under c (I never could figure out
why they weren\'t going _at_ c).

You must have been a very lenient referee, Richard. I see things haven\'t
changed that much in ten years. :->

Seriously, that just begs the question, just how stupid ARE the banks that
are responsible for the loans on these criminal capital machines? (With the
related question, if they were that stupid, why are the banks still in
business? Hmm. Sounds like another Hard Times reason. Everybody got bored
and greedy, applied to each other\'s banks for subsidized ships, then they
all skipped out and sold the ships.... Hmmm...)

Anyway, I would refer you to JTAS#16: "Giving the Bank a Fighting Chance."
I quote: "Banks finance ships knowing the risks involved, and *they do
everything possible to push the odds over into their favor.*" It goes on
to detail some easy preventative measures (credit checks, collateral,
full background review, intended use plan) as well as some more effective
measures (a timer built into the ship\'s computer which must be reset by
a bank official after each payment has been made). "Most banks, however,
find it simpler to deny the loan application in the first place."

This is in addition to the difficulty inherent in tampering successfully with
a black box and the computer anyway. The subsidized ships aren\'t THAT much
alike so that you can\'t tell them apart. Besides, even if they DID sell
the ship, they should have hordes of bank personnel and bounty hunters hot
on their trail, unless they repainted and renumbered themselves too! :->

Plus, if I were the bank, I would repo first and tend to the formalities
later (which would be legally justifiable given the high value and mobility
of a starship).

:Anyway, I would refer you to JTAS#16: "Giving the Bank a Fighting Chance."
:I quote: "Banks finance ships knowing the risks involved, and *they do

Funny you should mention that.  It was a (player character) bounty hunter
that did in that particular party.  Took a long time, (about a year real
time) and the (original) survivors were pretty jumpy before they figured 
out why people kept not returning from shore leave.  

This campaign was part of my original attempts at double-blind GM\'ing.
The player really liked it, but it was too much work for me.  I burned
out for a few years.

Ok, that\'s three of us.  Any more out there interested?  I have long
wanted to do the kind of campaign where I can test Naval Design Doctrine
to the Breaking Point.  This may be our big chance to take our Naval
Discussions out of the realm of theory, and try some of them out.

So it does.  Apologies for the misinformation...
That seems to pretty much render the high armour tank meaningless at
TL15+.
It also renders the whole line of discussion meaningless, since a
meson-gun armed tank ignores armour, so armour protects not at all. 
Neither does NOE, since both neutrino sensors and densitometers ignore
LOS, and the meson gun does too.  So what does that leave for TL15
combat?    There is no real defense from a meson gun equipped with point
defense fire-control, and no real reason not to use one, since it avoids
the problems of fusion guns (very easy to spot and pinpoint the firing
position of a fusion gun).
 
Hmmm...
This will definitely require some thought to come up with an adequate
doctrine that doesn\'t sound like MAD.
 
Oh yeah... 10cm in Striker is 100 meters.

You probably won\'t bother to defend the gas giant...
 
If you don\'t like mathematical analyses of role-playing events, skip
this message.  --Steve
 
I asserted without proof last year that it is more profitable to buy
fuel at the starport than to do wilderness refueling at a gas giant. 
Here is the proof:
 
Assumptions:
 
1)  The main world is not orbiting the gas giant.
2)  The gas giants are in the outer system.
3)  For the sake of discussion, the solar system is typical of solar
systems in general (I am not going to locate every gas giant in the
Imperium to prove the point.  I am going to use the solar system\'s gas
giant\'s to demonstrate the point)
4)  I will use a free trader, and a fat trader as example ships, because
I am too lazy to dredge up figures for every merchant type written up,
and those two are convenient.
5)  Mean time in Jumpspace = seven days.
6)  Mean time in port = seven days.
 
Average time to make a single trip (one way) is 14 days.
A ship can make 25 trips per year.
Unrefined fuel bought at a starport costs Cr4389 per trip (free trader)
or Cr7497 per trip (fat trader).
 
Time required for a one way transit to (or from) Jupiter: 155+ hours.
 
Assume a ship arrives at Jupiter, refuels, and transits to Terra (based
on a mean time to skim a gas giant from SOM).  The time required to do
so is about 162 hours, with a slight risk of loss of ship (5/1944).
 
Therefore, a ship which uses wilderness refueling adds about 1 week to
the cycle time for a single one way trip.
 
A three week trip cycle means the ship will only make 17 jumps per year
(if the crew feels safe about skimping on maintenance, 16 if not).
 
So, the ship saves immediate out of pocket expenses of Cr109,725 (free
trader) or Cr187425 (fat trader).  
A ship will lose, by not jumping, a minimum of the income from a cargo
hold full of consignment freight.  Therefore a free trader will lose
Cr655,344 by making only 17 jumps per year (MINIMUM).  A fat trader will
lose MCr1.5984 under the same conditions.
 
Since the loss of revenue exceeds the cost of unrefined fuel at the
starport by a factor of 6 for a free trader, and 8+ for a fat trader,
using wilderness refueling at a gas giant is an idea whose time passed
the first time a merchant got hold af a calculator, which was probably
11,000 years ago (the Vilani LOVE profit/loss examinations).
 
Therefore gas giant refueling is irrelevant to a merchant, and defending
the gas giant superfluous (except from enemy fleets).
 
Objections to the proof:  
 
Some main worlds orbit gas giants.  True.  If you don\'t mind the risk of
losing your ship, refueling at a gas giant is useful (in that specific
case).  Chance of losing a ship during gas giant refueling, over the
lifetime of the mortgage: greater than 82%.  How many banks are going to
finance a deal THAT risky.  That chance of loss assumes 17 trips per
year, all refueled at a gas giant.  Over the (80 year) lifetime of the
ship, chance of loss exceeds 96%, assuming the same.  Mean time to lose
your ship id gas giant refueling is SOP : 15.8 years.  Good luck, you\'ll
need it.  You\'ll also need to pay for your ship in 15 years if you even
HOPE to break even.  Good luck on that, too.
 
Some gas giants are closer than Jupiter.  Also true.  Some are farther
away.  A gas giant as close as Mars would add about 90 hours to your
turnaround time.  This reduces flights per year from 25 to 20 (or less).
This reduces lost income from the listed figures to Cr409,590
(Cr999,000).  This is still considerably higher than the cost of the
fuel.  Notice that the revenue from a full hold is higher than the cost
of a year\'s supply of fuel for a fat trader:  a fat trader should never
do wilderness refueling where the time required is great enough to cost
even ONE jump per year.  That condition applies if the gas giant is more
than 2.0736 Million Km away.  Therefore, by MT rules, a fat trader
should use gas giant refueling only in the case of a main world orbiting
the gas giant, or a gas giant in a captured orbit no more than 0.014AU
distant from the main world.  A free trader loses if it cannot make two
jumps, so the gas giant can be farther away, and still be remotely
useful.  The breakpoint for a free trader is 17.465 million Km
(0.117AU).
 
So effectively, no gas giant the main world is not orbiting is useful
for wilderness refueling, unless the ship captain doesn\'t mind losing
money.
 
BTW, it can be shown that the transit from jump arrival point to a gas
giant is long enough that a free trader/fat trader loses money by going
to a main world that orbits a gas giant.  Transit from Jupiter\'s jump-in
point to any of it\'s major satellites is about 20 hours, and Jupiter is
a SMALL gas giant by Traveller standards.  That would add two days to
your turnaround, and knock two jumps off your year\'s schedule, with
appropriate loss of revenue.
 
SO, defending the gas giant is largely unnecessary, and wasteful of
ships unless in a war situation (Navies don\'t care from money).
 
So, you only need a dozen ships per system to deal with pirates, and
twelve ships as small as a Sloan are NOT hard to come by.  Twelve ships
as small as an SEH aren\'t hard to come by either.  By TCS rules, a world
with population over about 38 million could support the latter, and
perhaps 10 million for the former.  Trin could buy enough for the whole
Spinward Marches.  
 
It\'s still a LONNNG way to making piracy safe in the Marches.

Does the word "convoy" ring a bell?
Besides, if the pirates are merchants in a pack, your original
assumption that the pirates are too tough for the Navy to deal with goes
by the wayside.  Then Gazelles will be sufficient for anti-piracy

An annual return of 3% represents 25 voyages.  If a ship makes 3% per
year, then if more than 3% of the ships were lost every year things
would collpase.  3% losses per year translates to one ship in every 821
in any given two week period.
 
And, yes, it is all a matter of starting capital, which is why none of
my characters buys a ship till he has MCr3 more than the required down
payment.  I just buy cargo and ship it on someone else\'s ship till then.
That way my ships always make gobs of money, and my characters typically
are multimillionaires.  Right now, one has a net worth rather more than
a billion, and one slightly less.  The newest one is worth more than the
other two combined.
 
BTW, to change the subject (almost) entirely, I would like to suggest a
new topic for discussion on the List.
 
   How do any GM\'s who feel like commenting deal with the tendency of
people with expensive, new ships to want to keep their ship in a safe,
money-making situation?  That is, how do you get the guys who just
bought a merchant ship on Rhylanor to leave the Rhylanor-Porozlo run,
which is arguably the safest and most profitable place to stay?  How do
you convince your players to go out into the frontiers where money is
hard to come by, and foreclosure is all too close?  Notice that GDW,
over the years, has suggested a great many adventures where the final
reward doesn\'t even make expenses, and at least one (the Traveller
Adventure) where Barratry is a way of life for the adventurers.  The
only adventure I recall where the effort was worth the reward was
"Prosperity for the Taking" which went a little overboard in the other
direction.

A TCS PBeM would be great!  A campaign game (as in the TCS rulebook) would be 
the most challenging and fun (especially incorporating the "fog of war" rules)!

Pauli and I discussed this a little bit ages ago.  Combat seemed very
difficult to resolve in any simple manner (if you wanted to say true to
High Guard anyway).  I think optimally for playing speed you\'d need to
resolve all combat in a single PBeM turn and this is where the problem
arises.  There doesn\'t seem to be any easy way to simplify combat so
that most combat options are available.  (In very early discussions we
looked at you\'d have to supply the combat orders for your fleet without
knowing what was on the other fleet was composed of!  Needless to say
this was quickly discarded as an option.)

On the positive side someones done it!  I did see an ad for a commercial
PBM based on TCS in Challenge.  Has anyone had any experience with it??

Another game with great potential for a PBeM would be Fifth Frontier War with
players representing various fleet admirals and also using "fog of war" rules
from TCS.  Combat here would be much easier to handle.  I\'d even to willing to
GM it myself and have often thought of converting it to PBM format.  Only thing
stopping me is that I\'ve never been able to get a copy ;-(  Has anyone else
run a PBM FFW?  Maybe people with the rules can suggest how easy it would be
to do.

The banks are still in buisness because the make lots of money buying
virtually new spaceships with wet paint and papers, and selling them
at a huge profit.  You think the PLAYERS are money machines, they have
to sell at loss on the black market....

But really, I\'d just put a transponder in that needs updates from a
bank office every 3 months or it starts scraming STOLEN STOLEN
STOLEN...  Go ahead, skip, see if I care.  If you disable the
transponder, naval ships have this bad habit of blowing up your ship.

Is the Sloan an SDB?  if not, why are we paying for jump drives?  I
always remember paying through the nose for jump drives, and if we\'re
staying in-system, why would we want jump drives?  Hell we can save
$$$$ on the hull we don\'t need for the jump fuel alone.  With planets
that have populations in the tens of billions, navies just get BIG.

  I know, and there is perhaps one way of evading the low hit probabilities 
for all weapons, and that is to use missiles with sensor suites as forward
observers that transmit targetting data back to the launching platform.

  The maximum range on which a radar can get a clear line of sight over
flat altitude 0 terrain between two grav-tanks on 1850m altitude is 350km
The reason behind the funny altitude is that I got this figure from the
revised LOS chart for Harpoon:)

  I had an idea for a gravtank looking somewhat like a sharp saucer with
a thickness to diameter ratio of 1:10. From tha altitudes and ranges one get
with the pancake theory this would mean a gain in armour thickness in
90% of the cases due to the (to put it mildly) radical slope.

  Isn\'t the purpose of inertial compensators to remove the effects of
accelerations by removing inertia (and thus mass)? I know that I wrote
weight but I wasn\'t totally awake when I wrote it:)

  The reason for the strange number of HUDs is that it is that one HUD per
panel is the most optimum combination to get a high number of CPs. I think 
it was Paul Dale that discovered this.

  There were some ideas about putting a max number of HUDs at 1/bridge

I didn\'t save it, unfortunately)

  Ok. I\'ll multiply the number of ships needed by ten for each world and
1000 for each GG. This gives 3030 ships per system as an estimate.

  Well, I\'ve never even seen a copy of TCS in real life so I think I might
be forgiven some blundering about it, but I still think that it is too low
to assume that a ship, crewed, serviced and based will cost just 10% of its
budget each year.

  I\'m basing my comments upon Mercenary where it said that a mercenary
force will have to pay 10% equipment cost each year on maintainance and
replacements, and on top of that the wages and exceptional expenses are 
added.
  
> Actually, a "suitable" ship is the 5000 ton fleet escort at about GCr4.
> Multiply ship availability by 7.75 again.

  Ok, but the number of ships goes up to, so the new better figures would
be 33 MShips (Ah! A new unit!:) needed for anti-piracy duty. Using the
pure 10% figure for spending on ships, a 100% of GNP defence budget and 
100% anti-piracy percentage each one of those 33 MShips can cost GCr66.
This is the absolute maximum upper limit on an 33 MShip navy.
  If we reduce defence spending to a more resonable level of the GNP, say
30% and anti-piracy percentage to 25%, each ship could cost GCr5. The cost
of them are GCr4, so lets just double cost and see the ships disappear:)

  I\'m assuming that while everything can be produced everywhere, the
production costs vary quite heavily from system to system. And when the cost
of making them on Cheapo/Massilia plus the cost of transporting them to
Not-so-cheapo/OldExpanses (including losses to piracy) is lower than the
cost of making them on Not-so-cheapo/OldExpanses some shrewd businesssophont
(3 \'s\'?) on Not-so-cheapo/OldExpanses will start importing them again,
undercutting the local production. First the local Not-so-cheapo government
will impose taxes and stuff and travel to Cheapo/Massilia to persuade them
to impose voluntary quotas, and if the profit is big enough smuggling will
appear. Sooner or later Not-so-cheapo will discover that many can play
that game, and discover that they as a whole will gain from free trade,
and remove the tariffs. And trade will start up again.

       How do any GM\'s who feel like commenting deal with the tendency of
    people with expensive, new ships to want to keep their ship in a safe,
    money-making situation?  That is, how do you get the guys who just
    bought a merchant ship on Rhylanor to leave the Rhylanor-Porozlo run,
    which is arguably the safest and most profitable place to stay?  How do
    you convince your players to go out into the frontiers where money is
    hard to come by, and foreclosure is all too close?  Notice that GDW,

Have you tried the Lunion-Ianic run?  That\'s the first jump my players
made with their many-years-to-pay Far Trader, and they did in fact
make a profit on it.  They were fairly lucky...Ianic has a bureaucracy
like you wouldn\'t believe, and it took a lot of bribery to get by the
import tariffs (which would have made the run a severe loss) and to
bribe the customs officers who searched the ship (fortunately they had
yet to build the fermentation vats and the still)...and then the
ship\'s doctor asked for a map to the city, and after being shuffled
around the various bureaus for about four hours discovered it was a
state secret and was deported at gunpoint.  The Lunion-Ianic run
doesn\'t look at all attractive now...
    Basically the mix of characters is sufficiently diverse that
sitting on one safe route is anathema to them.  The merchant himself
wouldn\'t mind it, but the scouts would object, as would the ex-Navy
folks, all of whom are needed to run the new ship they "found."  Now
they\'re fully caught up in doing the job of that ship\'s previous
owners and are two sectors to spinward of the Spinward Marches, and I
don\'t think they\'re going to find many safe routes there.
    If enough non-merchants are on the ship, as is (I believe) likely
with yer average player-character merchant (ex-Navy guys are a dime a
dozen, and don\'t interfere with how you run your commerce), character
motivation should drive them from the safe and easy.  After all, it
wouldn\'t be Traveller if they didn\'t Travel, would it?

Originally Frank wanted to do just that and let the players use what ever

talked him out of it.  The only praticial measurement to use in a game
situation is a mm and this is too fine a measurement for a wargamer (most

\'systems defined jump points make things easy\'

True...  However, in my opinion, not all systems are organized enough to have
jump points defined, published and guarded.  Cretainly and A or B starport
will, but maybe not C, and probably not D or E.

Then again, how many people will rather not use a defined jump point for
secrcy, privacy, skuldugery, and whathaveyou.  Possibly 10%.  Some people will
want to avoid your pleasant customs agents, etc.

I don\'t see a jump point being a precise point in any case.  While a group of
ships can jump in formation from the same place and time to the same place and
time, using shared data and linked computers, it is not a routine task to
complete with complete success (all ships ending up exactly where they are
supposed to).  Different pilots and ships and departure points and times makes
arriving at a same point all the time *very* difficult.  Also, do you want
*everybody* jumping into the same place?  How long before two ships jump at the
same time?  It\'s much more likely that the jump point would be a rather broad
\'zone\'.  How broad you make it depends on how the referee wants to play it.

RE: \'gas giant refueling loses money\'

Nice analysis...

I figure most people gas giant refuel when there is no refined fuel available.
Certainly that was the main reason that I liked having a refinery, because lots
of places I went to didn\'t have refined fuel.  Then again, there are those
people who would rather refuel anonamously at the gas giant then line up at the
pump. See above.

RE: TCS & FFW

I have both sets... but not at work.  I\'d love to play some time with anyone in
New England.  I\'m down in Norwich CT.  As for on the net, it\'s been a while
since I\'ve looked at them, so I need to read them over to see how to run it. I
won\'t volunteer to run it just yet, but I would like to play a campaign game,
with combat resolved on a turn by turn basis, where combat turns are about a
day apart.  Maybe less if the combatants and ref can turnaround messages during
the day, maybe more on weekends.  Campaign turns should probably be two or
three days.  Perhaps we could have a campiagn referee, and a combat referee to
make life easier.  I\'d like to have it as realistic as possible; IE:  You don\'t
know what other people/systems are doing unless you have a ship there, although
someone can tell you what is going on if they are there.  Lots of Diplomacy.
All dice are rolled by the referee.

I\'d prefer to play TCS, as I think it\'s requires less setup and bookkeeping;
it\'s a smaller campaign.

Nope, they still might have to fight against lower TL vehicles.  Or would
the military design and build several different kinds of vehicles depending
upon the TL of the enemy?  This may not be such a bad idea, the TL15 tank
designed to kill TL10 ones would be very different to one designed to kill
TL15 ones.

Ummm, there is a defence.  Meson screens exist.  True, rules don\'t cover
how they effect the above mentioned meson gun but meson screens have existed
for a long time (since HG!).  Also, under MT vehicles are designed using the
same (broken) rules as starships and no system restrictions are imposed.

Looking at my ref\'s guide, I see that a UCP 4 Meson screen occupies the least
volume (215kL, TL=14, Power=0.6mW/kL, 160Tons, MCr40).  Probably a little on
the heavy side for tank based usage.  However, a UCP 1 screen should be a little
better refined at TL=15 than at TL=12 (as is listed in the guide).  My suggested
TL improvement (as submitted to the TDR vehicle design sub-group) listed a
UCP 1 meson screen at TL=15 as 0.01mW/kL, 45kL, 40Tons, MCr5.  This would be
getting into the feasible range for a small craft.  I\'d be willing to introduce
a UCP 0 screen specifically for operations against the tank mounted gun.


>Hmmm...
>This will definitely require some thought to come up with an adequate

A meson screen might just be workable, a black globe would be much more
fun, but would be much too big and expensive to warrant mounting on a small
vehicle.

Consider yourself forgiven:)
Crew and service costs for a US Navy submarine (annually, excluding
shipyard visits for refits) is less than 5% of cost.  Basing is a whole
different ballgame, but the last Navy budget that I saw published had
about 40% to maintain existing bases.  The remainder was new
construction, which tells you how long its been since I\'ve seen one.

If the choice is fight them on their terms, or let them run amok, then

Assuming you don\'t use MT concept of trade, anyway.  Under MT rules,
cost of transporting something is a high enough fraction of cost of
goods that moving something more than 2 jumps is prohibitive.  Assuming
you use Lo Ni Po Ba goods Crwhatever.  If you want a real economic
system, where goods are priced according to type of goods, then you will
find that transport fees are reasonable for high value/low bulk goods,
and start moving them.
But if there is a significant price difference between various Imperial
planets, do you let PCs buy ships from the cheap places?  Or do price
variations only apply to NPCs?

In the Imperium, they do.  That\'s what the Scout Service does.  Note
that I don\'t believe in Jump points, but id=f they were there, the
Scouts would have maped them 600 years ago.

And your pleasant customs people will be most curious about a ship that
arrived on planet without using a Jump point.  A planetary sensor system
should be able to track any ship within 100 diameters, wherever it
arrives.  I believe NORAD can do that now, By TL9 it should be geedunk.

Notice that I assumed unrefined fuel refined on board.  And if your

their privilege.  Remember that their are SDBs lurking in gas giants,
and they probably notice people refueling there...

I wouldn\'t.  I notice that the meson gun (battlefield) is also perfect
for mounting on a merchant ship for anti-piracy defense.  Sounds like an
idea to forget as soon as possible.  Based on the fact (?) that no meson
guns at TL14- are less than 650Kl, I suspect that the battlefield meson
gun is one of those things that Traveller introduced because it was a
"neat idea", not because it fit the system.

Which is a fine example of operating at altitude.  What is the max range
at sea level on those charts?  I get 19nm for an effective height of
19m, which is rather taller than most tanks.  This give a Pancake
diameter of 70.4Km.  A 5m tank should not be detectable at more than
25Km.

Sounds good.  A little weak against orbital fire, but quite effective in
the pancake.  It would also be weak in dogfights, since it\'s vulnerable
angles are large, but if you kept your enemies at long range, this
should not be a problem.

No.  Inertial Compensators are anti-Jerk fields (jerk= first derivative
of acceleration).  They produce a grav field which compensates
internally for changes in the local acceleration field.

Under original rules, yes.  Under new rules, Large Gas Giants are size
105 to 245+ (thousands of miles diameter).   Small GG are size 15 to
105.  Jupiter has a radius of 69758 Km (plus or minus), ahich translates
to size 86.7.  Well within the Small GG range.
 
These rules are, of course, the World Builders Handbook, by DGP.

Meson Gun tanks:  There\'s one thing to consider about the meson gun tank, if
you are going to play using the Striker rules--it\'s considered to be an
indirect fire weapon, due to the difficulty of adjusting the meson speed
to decay at the exact target point (and other scientific double-talk).  We
could debate whether or not this is reasonable, but it is the rule.  The 
suggestion of a tank sized meson screen is not without merit, especially
when you consider that the the batlefiel meson accelerator is equivalent
to a Meson Gun-1  (I seem to recall that ship mounted meson guns get a
10cm/size burst radius), which means that you wouldn\'t need much screen
power to foul it up.

Armor thickness: I recently came to the conclusion that you were only to
worry about armor volume in Striker as far as weight and density were
concerned--just consider the enclosed volume to be the volume inside the
armor walls.  The only thing such an assumption has an effect on is the
final volume of the vehicle, and if you are feeling really account-like
(and the armor is thick compared to the size of the vehicle) you can add the
armor thickness to the basic dimensions, so that, for example, a tank with
a meter of frontal armor and four centimeters of rear armor, and a nominal
length of 6 meters would have a length of 7.04m for calculation of shipping
volume (and target modifier, if you think it would make a difference.).

Folks have been mentioned how it seems logical that no one crew member can
operate more than one HUD at a time.  Therefore ships with more HUDs than
crew members seems to be a real design idiocy.

But consider the alternatives, one HUD per crew member, and control panels to
suppliment the total until the ships total CP\'s are accounted for.

It seems to me that it would be more logical to have a crew member monitor
a HUD that is twice it\'s normal size (ie. 2 HUDs) than one HUD plus a hundred
control panels!  Doing so is more expensive, but saves space in a ship.
My experience in the air tells me it would be a LOT easier to look at one HUD
than monitor a slew of dials.  (Ok so I never had a HUD in a Cessna 152, but
even monitoring the 12 or so gauges is a chore)

Thus a HUD twice standard size seems MUCH preferable.  The rule in 101 vehicles
that one crew member can monitor TWELVE CUBIC METERS OF PANELS is truely a
nightmare!

Well, I\'d just like to try and clarify the blast effects in my mind.  GDW and
DPG are less than helpful in describing what a plasma bolt does.

contents of the entire room were fried.  (Annic Nova)

I have also seen references where an FGMP-15 was fired in an enclosed room
it hits a robot who is standing next to human characters and all that happens
is the robots arm gets blown off.  No one else is injured.  (trav Digest #8)

My reading of MegaTrav is that it does damage more akin to the former
description, but I have seen this vary from referee to referee.
I personally, would blow up the room.  But in the PBEM, at
\'Leadfoot\'s Last Stand\' a fusion gun was used without doing so.  (I think)

Perhaps the current PBEM ref\'s have different ideas about the performance of
the humble fusion gun than Richard does.  If so, I think the security team
should know just in case they feel footloose with such a weapon while standing
next to MY character... :-)
	(Mark?  Metlay?  Richard?  Comments?)

I also kinda wonder about the PGMP-14 and FGMP-15 grav recoil set ups.  If
they were used outside of the 10 diameter limit of a world, would the firer
only get half his recoil compensated for?

I think it was via email.  I didn\'t save it either but I added it to my
ship design program.  Looking there, the allocation of active crew positions
was:
	Bridge		100%
	Gunners		100%
	Command		85%
	Engineers	50%
	Maintenance	0%
	Flight Crew	0%
	Ship\'s Troops	0%
	Stewards	0%
	Frozen Watch	0% (surprising huh)
	Medical		0%

What these figures represent, is the percentage of crew members from each
section who is considered to be actively using the ship\'s controls.  It
is these who are allowed to use heads-up displays etc.  This places a limit
upon the number of such control add ons that may be placed into a ship.  I
don\'t consider it a hard limit in that a small excess won\'t hurt.  Also
for large holotanks, I try to limit myself to 2 or 3 in a large ship (how
many could be effectively used?).

I\'ve always assumed that no matter how many computers you have, only the \'best\'
one gets used for control calculations.  Remember TL=8 (?) is supposed to have
massively parallel computers (from book 8???).  Thus providing more computers
in parallel shouldn\'t give any advantage. (because the parallelism is already
there)

being a couple of options we can take:

TCS)      Basically just play a TCS campaign pretty much straight out of
the TCS rulebook.  If you have each and every turn (including all High
Guard combat turns) being played as individually PBM turns then there
isn\'t much of a problem going to a PBM format.  This seems to be what
Jim Baranski has suggested in a previous post.

FFW)	Have a simplified TCS style campaign using FFW rules for combat, 
building, movement and so on.  I guess this is just playing FFW with a 
different background :-)  Here I really mean just using the FFW rules and not
running the complete game.

In both games players would be individual fleet admirals and we would have
"fog of war" rules.  Jim Baranski sums up "fog of war" well as:

Jim Baranski:
>I\'d like to have it as realistic as possible; IE:  You don\'t
>know what other people/systems are doing unless you have a ship there, although
>someone can tell you what is going on if they are there.  Lots of Diplomacy.

I\'d much prefer FFW for a couple of reasons.

* 	I think there\'d be more people interested if there isn\'t a need for
a High Guard background.  And the more the merrier.  With fairly simple combat 
and build rules anybody could pick it up quickly.  Doing turns would also be 
much much simpler.

*	It\'s possible for TCS to bog down if all the players aren\'t really
dedicated.  The need for daily turns for combat is really a necessity if you
want the campaign game to progress at a decent rate.  With FFW you should able
able to play a complete campaign turn in a single PBM turn (including all
combat).

*       I\'m more interested in the "strategic" aspect and not the nitty
gritty of "tactical" High Guard combat.  General fleet movements,
co-ordination, capturing planets, not really knowing whats going
on..... I really want to play just for the feel of the "fog of war" or
blind system of play.  The simplest system we can place on top of that
and maintain a Traveller universe the better.

Do people have a particular preference?  Comments??

Jim Baranski:
>Would it be more fun in an unknown setting where you had to explore and make

Yes!  I like this idea.  Just give people a map and they have to explore it.
This is definitely the way to go.

I am willing to GM a FFW style game.  Like I mentioned--one small problem... :-)

I would prefer MT ship design.  I don\'t like the idea of being locked
into GDW\'s picture of future warfare.  I\'d like to try my own ideas
out.  As t the strategic level, TCS is slightly more complex than FFW,
but slightly more realistic, too.  The referee helps out a lot.

I can live with this, as I have played games like that.  More work for
the referee, but life is like that.

Scott Kellogg asks:
: What exactly does a Fusion/Plasma gun DO?
....
:I have seen references where a PGMP-12 was fired in an enclosed room and the

Probably depends on the size of the room, but sounds about right.


:I have also seen references where an FGMP-15 was fired in an enclosed room
:it hits a robot who is standing next to human characters and all that happens
:is the robots arm gets blown off.  No one else is injured.  (trav Digest #8)

Ugh.  I disagree, unless it was a clean miss and the robot was sideswiped.
(Or some other fiction to save the GM.)


:My reading of MegaTrav is that it does damage more akin to the former
:description, but I have seen this vary from referee to referee.
:I personally, would blow up the room.  But in the PBEM, at
:\'Leadfoot\'s Last Stand\' a fusion gun was used without doing so.  (I think)

Actually one of the engineering rooms _WAS_ fried.  Also turned radioactive.
Also everything loose was thrown around like rag dolls.  The robot was
damaged considerably, as were all of the room occupants.  Heat and radiation
spilled out into the adjoining corridor.

My reading is that in origininal Traveller the FGMP and PGMP were really
crew-fed weapons, like mortars or really light field artillery.  This means
the things are slow, hard to set up, and incredibly devastating in small
areas.  I\'ve always treated the PGMP as an "improved" FGMP without the
hard radioactivity, but more heat and blast effects.

The Traveller computer game "Zhodani Conspiracy" treats the PGMP like a
truly expensive carbine with great penetration and damage.  And this 
game is authorized by GDW...


:Perhaps the current PBEM ref\'s have different ideas about the performance of
:the humble fusion gun than Richard does.  If so, I think the security team

:next to MY character... :-)
:	(Mark?  Metlay?  Richard?  Comments?)

I\'d like to know this too, considering the current state of affairs in our
quiet little expedition.  

As a rule of thumb, I use 1m _radius_ (not diameter) for full blast and
heat effects, 2m radius-->50% 3m radius-->25%  4m radius-->10%  (not
truly the profile of a blast, but easy to do on the fly).  Penetration
falls off together with blast.  Walls contain blast, but only half the 
heat.  (In a small room, you might set the next compartment afire.)
Walls do nothing against radioactivity unless they are armor or bulkhead
or otherwise clearly superior to cloth and paper.

Balls of plasma are ballistic, and have really high drag.  That is, they
don\'t go line-of-sight, like lasers, and they don\'t go a long ways, like
bullets.  But for 10m out there, they sure beat grenades.

I still speculate as to the wisdom of using an FGMP inside engineering
of a starship in jumpspace... :=)  Orders is orders, though.

According to Striker Book 2 (which I finally re-located), a meson gun is
indirect fire because it can hit targets behind obstacles, and because
precise ranging is needed for it\'s use.  Also, according to Striker,
indirect fire weapons CAN be used in direct fire mode, if the
appropriate fire-control system is available.
As to the Meson Gun - 1, I find no evidence that it exists in MT or High
Guard.  It seems to start at Meson Gun-3.  A meson gun-3 does have a
danger space about that of the battlefield meson gun, but requires
25000MW, as opposed to 250MW for the battlefield version, and occupies
650Kl, as opposed to 15Kl.  They are both TL15.  Odd, that these
differences should be...
My problem with a tank-sized meson screen is that a meson screen
generator has minimum size of 215Kl at TL15- (or 108Kl at TL16), which
is rather large for a tank.  And if they can be made smaller, what is to
keep ships from mounting them?
 
 
>Armor thickness: I recently came to the conclusion that you were only

DOn\'t forget that the armour volume is based on the EXTERNAL dimensions,
not the internal ones.  So armour mass would need to be calculated using
external dimensions.

You overlook that there is a random role in there.  Spaceship TL can be
up to SIX levels lower than the "average".  However, when we generated
Efate for our campaign, it built TL15 starships, and turned out to be
THE main fleet base during the FFW.  It also will be the reason that the
Vargr won\'t make much progress against Regina and Aramis subsectors,
when that part of the Rebellion hits our campaign (late this summer, I
expect).

In ours, Vincennes can build TL18 spacecraft (at prototype stage so
far), and it\'s R&D is producing experimental TL18 ships with TL19
weaponry.

What a silly idea (leaving the ships behind).  The ship is almost
invariably worth more than the cargo is.  Take the ship, and leave the
cargo, if anything.
 
And any individual pirate is NOT going to think in terms of leaving the
prey alive for the next bunch to come along.  If a pirate steals a few
ships, he gets rich, Rich, RICH.  Then he retires when the merchant traffic
dries up.  Why should he care about other pirates\' problems?

Hi Folks,

Please abstain from using both the TML PBEM Aliases, and the
sunbane.engrg.uwo.ca TML ftp archive sites, until at least noon
Thursday, February 20th, 1992.  The CAT mailing list (cat@engrg.uwo.ca),
on the other hand, is okay - please feel free to use it.

An entire hard disk has gone very flaky at the UWO TML Archive/PBEM
Aliases site.  Dan Corrin, our accomodating Systems Administration
contact at UWO, has temporarily got the disk online again, but it is
spitting out drive errors left and right, so he is going to pack it up
and ship it off today for repair.

Barring any unforseen circumstances, it should be back the middle of
next week and normal service will be restored by Thursday.  If those
circumstances do happen, it could be a little longer than that.

I can say from experience that hardware failures frequently turn nice,
friendly computer systems folk into gruff, testy computer triage
specialists.  The users get demanding: Chicken Little with an attitude.
Dan has been admirably patient and accomodating despite this -- Thanks!

I think we should all view this as an opportunity to relax and
contemplate the non-PBEM aspects of our lives.  It is Valentine\'s Day
after all :-).

Thanks all,

James

Oh nooooo..... someone give these people an astronomy lesson 8-(

There\'s a theory (currently accepted as "presumed to be true" within the
community) that a gas giant won\'t get significantly bigger than Jupiter.
As the mass goes up, the density will increase fast enough that the size
won\'t change much at all.  I think that this theory predicted that
anything bigger than about a hundred thousand miles will be a sun.

Thus, _every_ gas giant in the real world will be small in DGP\'s eyes 8-(

That actually is ok.  Marc Miller\'s claim for "what\'s official for MT" was
that it was "Everything GDW has published for it except Challenge",
thus excluding DGP.  We\'re saved, those aren\'t the official rules 8-)

At that time he was using 25mm figures because they were so nice to look

deployable in each area to about a company (a battalion seems more
necessary for game purposes).  The setup was that you divided a world into
areas (about five or six areas the rules for doing this were very vague
since this was a combat system test ).  Between each area was a geographic
obsticle (usually a hill).
   The various areas were rated by what you could loot out of them.  We
had a city, a desert, a forest, and two areas of farmland (or something
like that).  Most areas had a town or bonus objective (the desert had a
nuclear plant).  The defender placed his forces into the areas based on
how he wanted to defend them.  The Space Vikings then landed in various
areas of their choice.  To move between areas you move onto the obstacle
and depending on your movement catagory moved off sometime later.
Essentially foot took a long time and everybody else was a turn or two.
Both sides ran the full specturm of unit types from high tech to cyberpunk.
The battle was close, but leaned toward the Space Vikings.
   After the second 25mm playtest (and my purchase and painting a unit,
sigh) Frank switched to 1/285 scale (can\'t complain too much since it was
my idea originally).  He also is going to make the rules more Command
Decision like (they were more like our miniatures version of First Battles
during the first playtest).

     Many people have expressed their discontent with the fact
that the Third Imperium is surrounded by other interstellar
empires, leaving it no direction in which to expand.  As a
result, there are no completely untouched worlds for the Scouts
to explore, and very little chance for first contact with a
sophont race, except perhaps for sophonts of Tech Level 0 who
live in networks of burrows forty kilometers beneath a planet\'s
surface.  As this sort of stuff is a mainstay of science fiction,
and the very sort of thing we\'d expect to find Scouts doing, this
lack of new worlds is very much a problem.
     There are a few obvious solutions to this problem, though
they are not very satisfying.
     The simplest is that we can assume that any world that is
not a High Population world is only incompletely explored, and
that any world that is a Low Population world has barely been
explored at all.  This idea appears to be the one usually assumed
by GDW and DGP (remember Tel Duramon, who spent his career in the
Scouts exploring Seven Sisters Subsector?), but it does may leave
one to wonder what the IISS Exploration Branch has been doing for
the last eleven centuries.  Of course, the Imperium does contain
a great deal of territory, and it would take a long time to
explore it all.  After all, it is only in the last few centuries,
out of ten thousand years of recorded history, that we have
thoroughly explored the Earth.
     Another solution to the problem is to roleplay members of an
interstellar empire that does have unexplored worlds on its
borders.  The Vargr and the Aslan are both in this position.  The
Solomani are, as well, and it should be fairly straightforward to
roleplay their situation.  But this solution has the strong
disadvantage of leaving our Imperials completely out of the
picture.
     There is one other solution, one which I think could be very
interesting, although it is much more problematic, and I propose
that we spend some time discussing it on the TML.
     We know that the Zhodani will launch another Core Expedition
"soon," but I have not heard a specific date mentioned.  We know
that relations between the Consulate and the Domain of Deneb have
warmed considerably.  What if, as a diplomatic gesture of
goodwill, or perhaps simply on a whim, the Consulate invites the
Domain to participate?
     Obviously, Scouts from the Domain could only play a minor
role.  The Domain of Deneb, struggling with Vargr and Aslan
incursions and a serious economic recession, could not really
match the performance of the large, harmonious, and prosperous
Zhodani Consulate.  But perhaps the Domain could scrape together
a "base ship" and a flotilla of Scout/Couriers and Surveyors.
     The Imperial contingent would, presumably, be asked to
explore systems peripheral to the main thrust of the Core
Expedition.  The Zhodani would not want the Imperials to know
what they were really after.  This enigma, and the tensions
inevitable between Zhodani and Imperials, would serve well as
background for the exploration of worlds.
     The greatest problem I see in this scheme is that it would
seem unlikely for the Imperials to interpret the Core Expeditions
as anything but the preliminary explorations for future Zhodani
expansion.  Perhaps someone else can see a way around this.
     This, then, is my suggestion.  Do with it as you will.

damage wrought by plasma and fusion weapons. This is a pet peeve of 
mine, as it appears to be very sloppily handled by just about everyone.

In Traveller as I\'ve run it, plasma and fusion guns can, do, and SHOULD
elicit an immediate response from all concerned (PCs and NPCs alike) of
"OH SHIT HE\'S GOT A PLASMA GUN! RUN! HIDE! SCREAM! FAINT! DISHONOR YOUR
TROUSERS!" They have been made easier to handle and use in successive
versions of Traveller, to the point where people are now quite cavalier
about handing them out. Which is, of course, bilge.

Having worked with a REAL plasma gun, I have a good feel for what the
man-portable weapons of the future can do. Let\'s run down the list
in no particular order.....

First off, radiation. There won\'t be any in a plasma burst; hot
hydrogen is hot hydrogen. The feasability of "containing the reaction
until fusion begins to occur" (as the description of fusion guns goes)
makes me a little queasy, as someone who kicked around going into
Tokamak development and aneutronic fusion but gave the idea up as
being too silly. If there IS appreciable fusion going on in a fusion
gun blast, the weapon becomes several orders of magnitude more
dangerous than a plasma gun, and a prime candidate for ejection from
TDR. I don\'t allow them in my games and am tempted to simply rule that
they\'re idiotically impossible. The figures for neutron flux from a
fusion burst are so high that they should be against the Imperial
Rules of War unless one\'s aim is to stir-fry entire infantry units in
a hurry and leave the gear behind. Recall the Pons and Fleishman
debacle-- one of the first indicators that they had not gotten cold
fusion (a different mechanism but the neutron numbers are Ok to 
within two orders of magnitude) to actually work is because the whole
state of Utah should have been rendered lifeless by the neutron blast.

Second, heat. This is THE primary way plasma does damage, because
there\'s so damn much of it. The blast zone of a plasma gun comes from
the plasma impacting and spattering, which it does with a relatively
isotropic shape (no one direction is strongly favored for spatter
under normal circumstances). Because the metastable conditions for
the plasma state are broken at emission and REALLY broken on impact,
the time of flight being considered small if not negligible with 
respect to the relaxation time of the system, the plasma ceases to 
be a plasma on impact, and merely becomes a puff of hot hydrogen gas
rather than some mysterious glowing glob of damnation spattering 
everywhere. This lack of romantic imagery doesn\'t change the fact that
as it epxands and cools, that "mere gas cloud" is dangerous as hell.

Third, light and noise. Both will be EXTREME, in a fashion I don\'t 
think anyone fully appreciates. A plasma burst is as bright as the Sun
in apparent magnitude, and looking straight at a PGMP going off should
carry the risk of blindness. The displacement of air by the expanding 
hydrogen cloud will produce a truly convincing thunderclap, loud
enough to rupture eardrums. The collateral heat from the plasma stream
will be enough to cook flesh instantly at a range of about 10 cm from
the plasma, so even a near miss will set clothing on fire and cause
horrible burns. What this means is that designing a PGMP or FGMP that
can be used by someone in comabat armor is OK, just barely, but going
beyond that to put them in the hands of individuals without armor at
all is ludicrous. That\'d be like firing a flamethrower barehanded,
staring into the Sun with a telescope and firing a howitzer without
ear protection simultaneously several times per minute. No thanks.

Fourth, I feel that I should comment on the fact that no one has ever
addressed the problem of maintainance for such weapons over the long
term. Replacing parts, refurbishing and recharging would require a lot
more support machinery and special skills than slug throwers would.

Does it sound like I don\'t think much of plasma and fusion guns? Yup.
I can see why they\'re popular-- they extend the killing ability of
the individual soldier into the realm of battle dress. But to MY mind,
they\'ll always be squad support weapons for use on the high-tech
battlefield, and someone using one under civilian conditions would be
like seeing a gang member in the streets of LA haul out an M79 and
start firing 40mm grenades at random-- OK for a Schwarzenegger movie
but a bit tough to swallow for reasonable games.

It\'s much harder to think up reasons why people shouldn\'t carry around
Gauss versions of the General Electric gatling used in PREDATOR and 
TERMINATOR 2, whose official designation escapes me. You could pack
10,000 rounds in a fanny pack and have an ROF capable of chewing up
a building, and a lot less collateral noise flash etc. than a PGMP.
The weapon itself would be light and easy to carry, and VERY deadly.

But then, I\'ve always been a sucker for Vasquez.... |->

It will take 25 successful pirating missions a month to get all the ships built

taking the ship has other problems -- you have to have a place to keep it
until you get rid of it, and you have to split your crew to man it, and you
still have the problem of selling it. I could see them taking the ship if (a)
their ship was too badly damaged, (b) if the crew was splitting up, going
seperate ways, and needed another ship, or (c) the pirates were real
scum-of-the-earth. The disagreement we have here is based on the perception of
pirates -- I use the early ones (about 1650-1700) as the basis for mine:
relatively honorable, and not intrested in the personal wealth of the crewmen
or passengers (unless of course such a person was worth a great deal of money
in ransom -- like a princess). Even when such pirates took the ship, they made
sure that the crew and passengers were put on a small boat (longboat or
smaller) and provisioned well enough so that they could reach land. The early
pirates were not common murderers or robbers. Not taking a ship mean that they
could steal from it again (and often did).

Is it possible to extract any new information about the Marches
from "Zhodani Conspiracy"? I mean like the listings only tells us
that Traltha is governed by a selfperpetuating oligarchy but the
game might mention that the oligarchs are called The Waterlords,
or perhaps that the capital of Quopist is named Oofle or that
Palique is the fief of the Imperial Baron Osborne von Travesty.

Overlook? That\'s why I wrote that there was a 5/6th chance. And
the lowest Space TL for a tech 13 world is 12. The lowest for a

Well within the World Builders rules too. What is not within

If pirates are know to steal the ships and space the crews, then virtually no

that if they surrender, the only thing have to lose is their cargo, they will
tend to surrender (provided their other choice is a fight with no mercy). Yes,
honor is silly to some people, but it has been around for quite awhile (even
u-boats in early WWI gave freighter crews a chance to get off the ships before
they torpedoed the ship; freighters started mounting suns and firing on the
subs as soon as they surfaced to give warning, forcing the u-boat commanders to
torpedoe ships without warning; the British (and other countries) then had the
gall to say that Germany was acting dishonorably!). There is also historical
presedence (from the Carribean) for a Brotherhood amongst pirates -- they would
not lie, steal, or cheat each other. In such a case, a pirate crew WOULD care
about the repurcussions of its actions on other pirates, unless it was a rogue

  Even a gauss minigun would have an obscene recoil. I\'ve forgotten exactly
what the recoil is for the 5.56 minigun, but it is in the order of tens of
kilos *average* pressure when fired on full ROF. 
  But it is possible to use it while standing: There is a low (600 r/m type)
setting designed for this, which is what I suspect they used in the movies:
\'Low\' auto on the gun and fast auto on the soundtrack. One can see this quite
clearly in Aliens for example where for each muzzle flash there is two to 
five shots on the soundtrack.
  
  The recoild would however be of lesser importance if we are talking about 
people in battle dress, but I\'m not sure it would be low enough even in that
case to allow walking around spraying wildly like in Simmons \'Hyperion\'.

  The way to go (I think) is laser gatlings. Using the 3G^3 rules it is 
possible to do a TL9 laser gatling with an ROF of 5000 and a punch about
equivalent to a heavy pistol (.357M or .44M) that weighs around 10kg and have
a powerpack of about as much. At higher TL is becomes possible to do even
nastier rapid fire lasers.

"Odyssey"-class Modular Mobile Starport

   The "Odyssey"-class modular mobile starport began as a feasibility study
created by the same naval architects who designed the "Plankwell"-class
battleship.  The entire ship is designed on a modular basis, and these
modules are connected together by means of a centralized spinal keel.
Although this design philosophy has been treated with skepticism, the
success of the "Plankwell"-class seems to have spoken for itself.  
   The actual construction of _Odyssey_ and later, _Gasuurpagu_, was ordered
by Emperor Paulo III in the late 1060s as a public works project to help
relieve slack economic conditions in the mid-worlds.  Due to the modular
design, the construction efforts could be spread among several worlds, and
the completed units hauled by jump transport to a single location for final
assembly.  The experimental Model/11 computers aboard the "Wayward"-class
jump transports were provided by worlds in Massilia and Deneb Sectors.
   The "Odyssey" combines a orbital class-A starport facility with support
units for some 2 million residents, a 200 million net metric ton propulsion
unit, and a "Wayward"-class heavy jump transport.  This allows a major refit
and repair facility to be moved some four parsecs rapidly, to whatever
location needs it most.

An "Odyssey" consists of the following components:
  * 1 Modular Support Spine        1,500,000 disp-tons
  * 4 LifeMod Spin Brackets          550,350 disp-tons ea.
  * 1 Starport Module              4,000,000 disp-tons
  * 1 Habitat Module               4,000,000 disp-tons
  * 2 Agricultural Modules         4,000,000 disp-tons ea.
  * 1 Main Engineering Unit          220,000 disp-tons
  * 1 "Wayward"-class transport   10,000,000 disp-tons

  Typical operation for a "Odyssey" involves locating it in an asteroid belt
from which it has easy access to raw materials, and giving the jump transport
a chance to refuel.  Ships severely damaged in battle can be hauled as cargo
to the port by a BattleRider carrier for repair, inspection, or salvage.
Placement in a deep space hex, for instance as a rift station, involves more
preparation in order for the "Wayward" to be removed from the site, or for
the "Odyssey" to be sited deeper into the rift.  Plans exist for expansion
of a new "Odyssey" ship into a large, static refueling station as keystone
for a chain of rift-crossing fuel caches, but the Rebellion has temporarily
halted these plans.  Typically, a naval "Odyssey" ship will be deployed with
a BatRon as port defense / escort.  _Gasuurpagu_ and her associated BatRon
are the entirety of the Imperial 303rd Replenishment Fleet.
  _Odyssey_ herself is currently operated by the IISS as a base ship for
distant exploratory missions.  Her class-A starport is ideal for repair,
maintenance, and refit of a large number of small scouting craft.
  The "Odyssey" ships must be able to support their local population without
recourse to their host systems.  Two agricultural modules supply food for the
station\'s two million inhabitants.
  Crucial to the continued mobility of the "Odyssey"-class is proper
maintenance, especially of the "Wayward" transport\'s Model/11 computer.  All
required parts and technical experts are included in the ship\'s manifest to
allow this to be done on site.  The Model/11 computer is doubly-backed up
in case of problems with the experimental system.   
  The statistics below reflect the ship as delivered.  Often the inhabitants
will use part of their pay to improve their stateroom systems, bit by bit,
using local equipment while in jump space.

DESIGN NOTES:
I got the idea for this monster from recent discussion about the difficulty
of maintaining fleet ships away from home.  Yeah, it\'s frivolous, but it\'s 
INTERESTING and frivolous! :)  I estimated the starport size from an old
JTAS article on space habitats, which put a class-A starport in a spherical 
habitat with a 5km radius.  Since most of that habitat was air, I estimated
the starport size at about 2 million tons-d for the equipment and docks, and
tried to figure out a way to move it and its\' support facilities around. 
  I also discovered that there is no logical reason to use gravitics in
unstreamlined naval vessels.  Fusion Rockets are smaller, cheaper, and
actually help increase your agility just by operating.  Local worlds might
not like a ship that tried to *land* using fusion rockets, though.
  The Model/11 was required because the "Wayward\'s" large jump drive required
about 650 million CP input to the computer, overwhelming even a Model/10!
If the jump drive was shrunk down, it might be possible to use a smaller
computer instead.  The other systems are negligible in comparison.
  I needed a large tanker to act as fuel shuttle for the "Wayward", so I 
modified Bertil Jonell\'s old design of the "Shuglikki" fleet replenishment
ship into a interplanetary tanker, saving considerable time.  (Besides, the
Navy would probably like keeping some standard class ships in the inventory.)
I hope you don\'t mind my variant, Bertil!

"Wayward"-class Heavy Jump Transporter 

The "Wayward"-class heavy jump transporter was originally designed especially
for the Odyssey Project.  It is the most powerful jump carrier in the arsenal
of the former Imperium, perhaps the single greatest human feat of jump
engineering.  "Wayward" was designed to carry a total payload of twenty million
displacement-tons (NOT including itself) up to four parsecs through jump space.
   Central to this vessel is its\' highly experimental Model/11 computer system,
necessary to complete the massive calculations required by the jump drive.
Some examples of this hull have been built to carry lower payloads, allowing
smaller computers to be used.  A great deal of expansion space remains on the
"Wayward" for installation of more fusion rockets or for weapons systems.
  
Jump Capacity vs. Maximum Range:
  * 21.4 million tons-disp at jump 6
  * 25.0 million tons-disp at jump 5
  * 30.0 million tons-disp at jump 4
  * 37.5 million tons-disp at jump 3
  * 50.0 million tons-disp at jump 2
  * 75.0 million tons-disp at jump 1

Modified "Shuglikki" Insystem Fuel Ship:

   The "Shuglikki" class fleet supply ship is a standard design
that has been in operation for many years.  Its\' original purpose was to
travel with BatRons as a long-term resupply source, protected by its\'
cruiser escorts.  In this variant on the design, the vessel has been 
converted to a streamlined interplanetary fueler, with as much of the
vessel as possible having been converted to LHyd tankage.
   This variant is most notably in use as fuel shuttles for the
"Wayward"-class heavy jump transport.  Typical operations involve each
shuttle making some fourteen runs over several days to refuel the transport
and themselves.  They manage this rate of refueling by transferring all
but a small reserve of their fuel to the vast tanks of their parent vessel.
   The hull is shaped as a streamlined cone, with seven connected cylinders
laying side by side.  Aft of this is the engine assembly and in front
is a bulbous area containing the living quarters and the bridge. 

[This ship converted from a very useful design originally by Bertil Jonell.]

Modular Support Spine:

The Modular Support Spine connects the various elements of the "Odyssey"
into a single integrated starship.  Inspired by early TL-8 modular starship
design philosophies, the spine allows all units connected to it to draw on
the resources of the other units, and facilitates transportation of materials
and personnel from module to module.

LifeModule Spin Bracket:

The "LifeMod" or spin bracket is the support unit for the "Odyssey"\'s
standardized four million displacement-ton modules.  It allows the modules 
that require internal gravity to spin without resorting to spinning the 
entire "Odyssey".  It is virtually an integral part of its associated module, 
providing basic functions such as life support, crew service, and power 
generation.  It also contains the inertial compensators for the 
module/bracket complex, although it depends on other parts of the tender 
power grid to supply the energy to activate them.  If all other supports 
are cut off, a bracket and its module can survive for a month on internal 
power.  (I really didn\'t feel like installing a 2.7 terawatt fusion generator 
for each module just so things would stick to the floor!)

         Power insufficient for operation of Inertial Compensators.


Agricultural Module:

The Agricultural Module has no controls or accommodations, or sufficient
power on its own, and depends on the tender for environmental support. 
Gravity is provided by spin on the mounting bracket.  A maser communicator 
is provided in case the control lines fail for some reason.  A single 
AgriMod can support one million inhabitants indefinitely.

Habitat Module:

The "Habitat" can provide residences for two million shipboard residents.  
All services (most power, LS, control) are provided by the tender or the
mounting bracket.  The mounting bracket also allows the module to spin to 
generate non-gravitic "artificial gravity".  SmStaterooms were used to cut
costs: an even mix of Staterooms and SmStaterooms would have added 
MCr 260000 to the unit\'s cost.

Starport Module:

The port facility module is designed slightly differently than the other 
modules.  Unlike the Habitat and AgriMod types, it does not spin on its 
LifeMod, and it is designed as a dispersed structure in order to speed 
docking of vessels.  Half of the module consists of the port\'s fuel supply, 
some 2 million displacement-tons of refined hydrogen.  The remainder of the 
module consists of the facility itself.  The costs of the starport facilities 
are NOT included in the price of this module, and the statistics for the 
facility (except mass) are not either.  The port itself, when installed in 
the module, depends on the LifeMod for LS and inertial dampening only.

         Mass figure assumes 1kL Starport = 1 metric ton.


Main Engineering Unit:

The main engineering unit contains the main fusion rocket drive system and 
also the power generation equipment that in conjunction with the solar power 
system, runs four modules worth of inertial compensators when the ship is 
under thrust.  Fourteen days of thrust fuel for the ship is provided by this 
section.  This section can operate independently for a day or two and skim 
fuel for itself if necessary, but normally the crew lives on the tender.

<about Ancient starmaps and stellar positions>
 
I wish I could help, but I can\'t in any meaningful way.  Stellar
velocities vary depending on their orbits about the galactic center. 
Barnard\'s Star is moving fast enough to have crossed several sectors in
300,000 years.  Sol is moving about 12Kmps relative to most of our
immediate neighbors, and so would have moved about 4 parsecs in 300,000
years.  
Basically, you can (and should) rewrite the sector map any way you
want.  Keep in mind that the Ancients probably did NOT use Imperial
mapping conventions, so a map of the "Spinward Marches" would be
slightly unreal.  Make the map one of some largely arbitrary area, say
45.341 parsecs by 61.202 parsecs.  Avoid Imperial conventions like the
plague - mark each star separately, including "distant companions". 
Don\'t treat all stars in a given parsec hex as the same system.  And
don\'t mark one main world per system, mark as many as are appropriate.

You are letting your prejudices interfere again, Bertil.  There is not any
good reason why you can\'t use a VERY SMALL amount of plasma, and so keep
the sound/light/shock/heat effects (relatively) small.
There is also little reason to believe you cannot fuse a SMALL amount of
hydrogen.  That should suffice to limit the radiation effects.
Whether this would matter to a man outside of the nearest set of combat
armour is debatable.  Notice that the rules do not state that a man can use
either a PGMP or FGMP without armour, just without POWERED armour.

A novel set of theories.  It ignores one or two fairly relevant points:
 
  1)  Pirates probably do not care whether the victims can be robbed
again and again.  Take one Tukera liner home, sell it, and retire.
 
  2)  Probably more relevant to your picture - in the 15th and 16th
centuries, the cargo from a ship was frequently worth more than the
ship.  Sometimes A LOT more.  In MT, most cargos are worth no more than
a small fraction of the value of the ship.
 
  3)  There is also a lot of room between taking the ship and killing
the crew.  Neither especially implies the other.  You can put the crew
out in vacc suits, and they could probably be rescued in plenty of time. 
They are, after all, within a few million Km from the main world (unless
they are stupid, or somehow unable to add).
 
  4) As to selling the ship, that\'s where the Vargr come in.  I doubt
the Vargr care from clean papers.  Selling a ship in the Extants should
be a matter of listing it in the classifieds, and waiting a bit.
 
  5)  As to the crew difficulties, notice that pirates traditionally
carried large crews for that very purpose.
 
My own opinion of pirates is that they are in it for the money, and not
likely to worry about leaving ships behind to be robbed again.  There is
more money in carrying the ship to the Extants to sell than there is in
leaving it behind.  For that matter, the amount of damage (in Cr) that
can be done by fairly trivial resistance costs more to repair than most
cargos are worth.  Keep in mind that one triple laser turret costs MCr3
to replace if destroyed (fairly likely if using merchant weaponry), and
the cargo from a free trader is worth maybe MCr6 at most.  Take two
hits, and the profits evaporate.  Take the ship, and it can pay for your
repairs (unless you take good hits.  Notice that a J-drive hit will
probably cost MCr10 or so to repair).
 
 
>Some more stuff about my honorable pirates:
>

SO why space them?  Take their ship and let the crew live to run home. 
Then they can surrender another ship to you later.

Sounds like you have been reading GURPS Swashbucklers.  I notice that
those pirates (Brethren of the Coast) usually took the ships, and
marooned the crews in small boats.  Obviously THEY didn\'t worry too much
about robbing the ships repeatedly.

BTW, why do pirates care how long it takes to build a ship?
And why use an impoverished subsector that can only build 300 ships per
year?  Efate probably builds 5000+ per year by itself.

I shall work out full details of how we shall run the game if or when I get

Once we have exchanged moves, we exchange a list of all places where we
think combat occurs.  I have yet to work out full details of how combat will
be resolved, because it will depend on how quickly we want the game to

That\'s what I would expect, too.  The last time I played Traveller, my
character preferred lasers (preferably TL13+) to PGMP\'s and FGMP\'s, as lasers
are much more useful in confined spaces.  I also figured that a PGMP\'s recoil
made it less capable of doing snapshots - even in battledress, you have to
assume a correct aiming posture, and while you\'re doing that, I\'m just 
pointing and firing.

So?  I don\'t expect so-called computer role-playing games like that to
accurately represent reality, even the fictional "reality" of Traveller.  It
was probably a lot easier for the programmers to treat a PGMP as described
above, than to write a special piece of code for it.  Anyone who thinks he
can do better, please do!  (Then I might buy it.)

But because of the nature of a meson gun, direct fire-control is not
possible, therefore not available.  So I think that vehicle-mounted
meson guns would be TL15 self-propelled artillery, not tanks.  Thus
they would be lightly armoured, as self-propelled artillery often is,
and as someone else said they would be in another message.  But there
would still be TL15 tanks, heavily armoured and equipped with energy
weapons (fusion guns and/or lasers), point defense and perhaps meson
screens.

If he was a time-traveller, and came from a high-tech world with grav-tanks,
he was probably right.  :-)

He had just read the minimum size for a meson screen.  I also think that
a three-thousand-mile long rocket is not something we will see for many
years.  :-)

Well, if I were a pirate and had enough spare crew for boarding parties, I
would certainly capture the ships.

That\'s assuming that you can sell the ship to someone who won\'t ask too
many questions about where you got it.  (Which a character of mine did.
Our GM was quite lenient at the time, and anyway we were operating in
Vargr space.)  But even without the prospect of selling the ship, you
probably do not have much time to offload the valuable part of the
cargo.  In fact, you might not have much time to _find_ the valuable
part of the cargo.  If the ship sent out a distress signal, you want to
be out of that piece of space as soon as possible.  Besides, if you take
the ship, you can take more cargo - you only use your own ship\'s cargo
hold if the freighter\'s crew succeeded in disabling the freighter before
you captured it.

I would not kill the freighter\'s crew, unless they had done something to
deserve it (e.g. disabled the ship).  I would want to get a reputation
for showing mercy to the crew if they co-operated, in the hope that the
next ship would be more co-operative.  If I got a reputation for giving
no quarter, the next ship would be quite likely to fight, and possibly
self-destruct, before I could capture it.  After all, if they know they\'re
going to die anyway, what do they have to lose?

	I use a sector set about 500 years after the Rebellion, where there is 
precious little in the way of luxury resources. What liners there are small and
have a low resale value (they tend to be of spartan comforts and of the \'it\'ll 
get you from point A to point B\' mentality).

	Along with the above, most merchant vessels are under 500 tons,
meaning they will not carry trivial cargo; whatever they carry IS valuable

	Yes, but if an independant merchant knows that he is going to lose his
ship, there is less of a chance he will surrender, since it will be difficult
for him to easily get another.

	The Vargr, unfourtunately, do not exist as a racial entity in my
campaign.

>carried large crews for that very purpose.
 
 	I usually have 2 sets of crewman and an equal number of \'marines\'
on board my pirate vessels

	Well, true, but the ships they hit tended to be either owned by the
Spanish government, or belonged to large trading companies. In my campaign,
over 90% of the merchants are independant. So, some changes had to be made...
 
>BTW, why do pirates care how long it takes to build a ship?
>And why use an impoverished subsector that can only build 300 ships per
>year?  Efate probably builds 5000+ per year by itself.

	Well, I guess by MT standards, my campaign sector is impoverished,
but considering it\'s in the rebuilding stages nearly 500 years of Dark Years,
you couldn\'t expect a great deal more. Anyway, the 300 ships a year are
merchant vessels built at civilian ship yards. It does not include non-merchant
civilian ships, or military and exploration vessels (which have their own 
ship yards). The central \'empire\' of my sector consists of about 20 systems,
and cranks out about 600-700 ships a year (excluding small craft that are not
jump capable). Pirates end up having to care about ship construction times since
if they start taking ships left and right, they will put a severe dent into
available ships to plunder (see also below).
	Perhaps my pirates wouldn\'t function in an \'official\' Traveller 
universe (whatever that may be now...), but they work well in mine. Most 
pirates in my campaign fall into two groups. The first are those who get their
ships and maintainence from independant worlds in return of a share of the loot
(more or less privateers). The second group is old, semi-obsolete military 
vessels with second line or reserve crews employed by a empire pretty much 
ruined by my main one (though they aren\'t pirates in the conventional sense 
either). Retaliation against the first group, if the threat gets bad enough,
is simple: about 20% of the empire\'s fleet is sent to the world backing the
privateers with the job of wrecking any starships they find, and of destroying
all shipyards. The second group is much harder: the natives of the vanquished
empire are too fimly entrenched and militarily equipped for such action. While
no longer a real military threat, they can, at best, only be reacted to when
their raiders appear (the Navy has deployed a great deal of Q-freighters in
systems on that section of the sector).

	The minigun in Predator might have been the 5.56mm NATO XM-214.
However, the minigun from T2 looked more like the 7.62mm NATO version found in
choppers (amongst other vehicles). Remember, Arnie was a lot stronger and
heavier than a normal human. Also, the weapons (esp. barrels) did not look
the same.
	I\'m curious as to what the smart gun from Aliens actually is (the
novel didn\'t go into any detail). The guesses around here are:
(1) gauss (unlikely)
(2) caseless ammo using electricity rather than a firing pin (possible)
(3) caseless ammo in a chain-gun (more likely -- a 7.62mm chain gun weighs
under 35 pounds unloaded today)
	A lower rate of fire is a must for a man-portable weapon, since on
full auto the XM-214 eats up about 4000 rounds per minute which means ammo 
shortages would abound (this is, IMHO, even a worse problem than recoil).

>Whether this would matter to a man outside of the nearest set of combat

In Book 4: Mercenary, of the 3 PGMP and 2 FGMP, only 2 of them require the
user to wear battle dress (the highest tech level versions of each use grav
compensators to cut down the recoil, and the lowest tech PGMP is already
stated as having a horrible recoil (and a poor rate of fire because of it)).
The only one of these weapons I let PCs get their hands on was the PGMP-12,
and only one per party (they were rarely used, since they are illegal just about
everywhere (law level -1 anyone?...)).

I whole heartadly agree with this.  My groups have complained of this
frequently or dropped big hints that it would be fun.

There is yet another solution.  You could back off of the GDW officialness 
of the rebellion a little (not much mind you).  There is room spinward of
the Spinward Marches where the Zhondani have not expanded rimward and the
Aslan have not expanded coreward.  Right next to the Marches, that corridor
is quite thin, however it does open up some a few sectors out.  (Look at the
adventure Laviathan (sp) for references).  There has been plenty of unexplored
turf to mess with.

The real problem that I have is with the world generation.  It is built on 
assuming that a thriving interstellar community exists.  A little creative
thought can go a long way in interpreting the data from the UWP.  High TLs
and starports are hard to justify, but could.

The other factor that can be used is the fact that a majority of the worlds
outside of the Imperium were mapped from long range by the IISS during the
first grand survey and that information may not be completly accurate.

Just some thoughts.

MT design is too complex.  Trying to reduce a MT design to something where
the ref could handle large combats would be a major pain.  If the players
discovered that the ref was ignoring avionics totally, they would no longer
include them.  MT combat is much too tactical to convert for an e-mail
medium.  Ideally, combat should be resolved in a single turn for each
player.  In reality, the players would submit move turns and the ref would
send back some details about the enemy fleet encountered (e.g. 4 large, 10
medium, 20 small and about 200 fighters).  The players would then submit combat
turns and the fights would be resolved.

My current ideas for combat involve a line of battle (list the ships in some
order) and a tactic selection (e.g. Retreat, ship on ship, suicide fighter
screen, ... [ any suggestions ]).  The player\'s tactics are compared and
damage / destruction is assigned to each side.  The player can also specify
a retreat threshold and upon taking that many casualties the player\'s fleet
attempts to retreat from the enguagement.

The combat will no long be HG or MT but it should be workable.  The ship
designs could still be HG (I wouldn\'t use MT) or even book 2.  I\'d also
split the ships into 4 classes (Battleship/cruiser/destroyer/fighter).  The
split would probably be by volume not weaponary.  Also, if the TL is kept down,
you only have to worry about lasers/missiles/sand casters.  PA spinal mounts
can be treated specially targeting a single ship and rolling to damage/destroy
it.  Meson spinals (if they are available) would roll to destroy.  Fusion/plasma
weapons could be converted into extra beam batteries.


Any comments/suggestions?

Turning into a variation of empire!  I don\'t object to exploration and contact
but initially at least it might be better to have a relatively small cluster
of systems at low TL.  I think starting each player with a few systems which
has recently discovered jump drives might be workable.  The player would know
some general information about the neighbouring systems but not all the
specific details.  Of course, all sides would think that all the others are
child murdering commie scum ;-}

RE: Jump Points

Baranski: True...  However, in my opinion, not all systems are organized enough
to have jump points defined, published and guarded.  Cretainly and A or B
starport will, but maybe not C, and probably not D or E.
 
Steve: In the Imperium, they do.  That\'s what the Scout Service does.  Note
that I don\'t believe in Jump points, but id=f they were there, the Scouts would
have maped them 600 years ago.

The Scout Service may have mapped/defined them, but my point is does everyone
actually use them?  Is there anyone hanging around in the lesser systems to
guard them and enforce use of them?  Maybe, Maybe not...

Steve: And your pleasant customs people will be most curious about a ship that
arrived on planet without using a Jump point.  A planetary sensor system should
be able to track any ship within 100 diameters, wherever it arrives.  I believe
NORAD can do that now, By TL9 it should be geedunk.

Given enough resources, you can hide from any scanner.  Also, a Captain needing
privacy would most likely file a flight plan that he was doing some intrasystem
exploring/trading/prospecting, fly past the range of any given sensors, jump
out, do their business, jump back in somewhere in the system, but out of sensor
range, and just motor back to the planet.  There are always ways to get around
customs.

I\'d *much* rather play TCS then FFW (this time), and *much* rather use High
Guard then MegaTraveller, which I know nothing about.

Steve: My current ideas for combat involve a line of battle (list the ships in
some order) and a tactic selection (e.g. Retreat, ship on ship, suicide fighter

This is about how I hope things will work out in practice, although I don\'t
rule out individual turns.  I expect people involved in combat to do a turn a
day or more, and resolve a combat in a week at most.  That sounds fast enough
for me, and still possible to capture most of the detail of the combat.

Steve: I\'d also split the ships into 4 classes (Battleship/ cruiser/ destroyer/
fighter).  The split would probably be by volume not weaponary.  Also, if the

Why do you think this is necessary?

In my copious spare time I\'m working on redoing Beyond and Far Frontiers
sectors, but it\'s a lot of work if you aren\'t satisfied with completely
random data. I like my universe to make a bit of sense (although I\'m not
a fanatic; I\'ll take playability and the proper ambience over realism any
day ;-), so it\'s slow going. Is there anyone out there that might be
interested in working together with me in creating several small interstellar
communities an a large honest-to-goodness nobody-knows-for-sure-what\'s-at-
the-next-star unexplored frontier?

It\'s not??? In Striker, any weapon that fires in a straight line has a
direct
fire control.  Just buy the one for the TL in question, and mount your
meson
gun in a turret of at least 20Kl.

Mighty big tank, eh?  16 tons for the meson screen, 1+ for the gun, 2+ for
the power plant, more for crew, armour, drives, sensors.  Probably 25+
tons.  The
M1 Abrams is rather less than 6 tons displacement.
 
As to the question of a smaller meson screen generator, the MT rules set
the 
smallest one at about 2.5 tons (at TL21).  Since MT provides us a look at
the 
technolgical improvement in meson screen technology for the next 6000
years, it
is probably safe to say a smaller one can\'t be built at TL15.

The most valuable part of a starship is not the "luxuries".  It is the
drive 
section:  Free Trader TL15 MCr36.915 : M-drive MCr2.8, J-drive MCr12, 
P-plant MCr11.  Total drive section is MCr25.8, which is 55.9% of the value
of the ship.  The hull adds another MCr10.494 t that, which means the hull
and drives amounts to 78.7% of the total value of the ship.  {the
percentage 
values WERE adjusted to take into account the 20% discount for mass 
production included in the ship price}
And, before you say that you don\'t allow TLs higher than ?? (12?), let me 
point out that the drive section of a TL12 free trader would run 85.5% of
the value of the ship, since low tech fusion plants cost more than high 
tech ones, which increases the relative value of the drives {a TL12 990MW
fusion plant costs MCr33, a TL 15 one costs MCr11}.

Hmmm... 
For that TL12 free trader, a cargo worth more than the ship would have a
value of about KCr54.679 per Kl (KCr738.167 per ton disp.).  Assuming MT
cargo rules, there ain\'t no such animal.  Assuming classic Traveller cargo
rules, the only things that meet the bill are Machine Tools (KCr750 per
ton), 
Radioactives(KCr1000 per ton), Gems (KCr1000 per ton), or Computers 
(Kcr10,000 per each).  Gems and radioactives come in lots under 81Kl, which

leaves 92% of your cargo hold empty, and leaves the value of cargo at 11%
of
the value of the ship (maximum).  Machine tools (the best cargo from old 
Traveller) come in lots of up to 405Kl, which leaves your hold less than
half 
full, and your cargo value at 41% of your ship (maximum).  Computers are
kind
of iffy.  If the computers were 10 tons or less, and you had a cargo hold 
full of them, then the cargo would be worth more than the ship.  But I
doubt
you can run an interstellar trade for long on cargos of computers alone.
Especially since the frequency they turn up is one trip in 36.

NO Vargr?  Do you have criminals?  I am sure that anyone wanting to join
the
pirate business needs a ship.  I also suspect that there are wars, in which

case, one side or the other will pay handsomely for captured ships.  That\'s
what Prize Courts are all about.

Sounds like a personal problem.  Historically, the Yankee privateers
carried
enough men to man ten prizes, if they could get the men.  There was a lot
of
competition between various privateers for the available seamen.

This assumes the pirates are "environmentally sound".  If they are in it 
for the money, then one good ship sets them up for life, and any given 
pirate  can, and should, ignore ship production rates - that can be his 
successor\'s problem.

I know this may sound silly, but why do your empire\'s enemies go out of
their
way to preserve the shipping of your empire?  If they destroy that
shipping, thenthey have defeated your empire?  If they let it live, and
just siphon off a little, then they will never win their little guerrilla
action.  Check out histories

I\'m willing to GM a PBEM based on FFW rules.  I\'ve been thinking that the
full campaign may be a bit much to play out initially, and am interested in
playing a TCS style campaign using FFW rules as a basis.  When I get the
rules (thanks Arthur!!) I will put forward a more definite proposal though

Eeeek, that background is a little on the large side for play testing purposes.
I\'d be willing to offer to moderate assuming that a reasonable set of rules
(for combat) can be arranged.  I\'d want to limit the number of players and
the sizes of the fleet they\'ll be using to something I can handle in my spare
time.

I rule out individual turns as soon as the players are located in different
continents.  The time zone shifts are going to kill daily turns.  So far, we\'ve
got potential players from the US (-7 hours GMT?), England (GMT) and Australia
(+10 hours GMT).  If somebody from either the US or Australia GMs it will
take more than one day to receive/reply to mail.  (I haven\'t worked out the
time shifts for an English GM).  I can give lots of examples from the current
PBeM game where I\'ve arrived in to work only to discover that heaps of things
have happened and I have had no chance to react to any of them. (e.g. I
received the warning that the PBeM turn was about to close well after midnight
time).  Turns every two days is the fastest possible rate we can reasonably
sustain and slower than that would be even better, players have to think about
what they are going to do.  Once things like flakey mail connections are taken
into account fast turns become an impossibility.

>Why do you think this is necessary?

I\'ll try to explain my reasoning, please bear in mind that my intention is to
allow combat to be resolved in a single turn (and also that the combat will
initially be resolved manually).  The spinal mounts are pretty much a kill or
miss suite of weapons so they will require some special handling (target them
on a class of ships or the largest surviving ship).  I haven\'t worked out
details of this special handling but it should not be too difficult to do in a
reasonable manner.  The reason for classing ships into the four groups I
mentioned are:

1) Simplifies shot allocation (the player specifiec a class not a specific
	ship to shoot at).
2) Doesn\'t require the exact nature of the enemy fleet to be revealed, thus
	increasing the fog of war (which must be good clean fun ;-)
3) Simplifies the tactics effects on the combat (e.g. the fighter screen
	tactic might increase the defence of the large ships at a cost
	to the fighters defence).
*) I\'m sure I could think of several other reasons if I tried hard.

I was also toying with the idea of reducing ships to a few numbers (just
like in the game Imperium which has beam/missile/defence though probably not
quite so sever as that).  What is really necessary for a ship?
Armour, Laser attacks, Missile attacks, Sand casters, Jump factor and
possibly Agility.  There are most likely some others that should be included.
I am sure people will help out and tell me all about them.

Since everything will be run initially by a single person, simplifications like
this must be made.  It might be possible to allocate combat resolution to a
third party player who would have to be trusted by the ref and the combatants. 
In this case, the combat system could be made more involved.


Hopefully the orders will end up looking something like:
- ----8<----
BEGIN TURN
<Tactic choice>
<damage before retreat attempt>
For each ship:
	<ship ID> <target class> [spinal target class] {special orders}
END TURN
- ---->8----


Where the stuff in []\'s only applies if the ship has a spinal mount.  And the
stuff in {}\'s is yet to be defined in a reasonable manner.  The ships would
probably be listed in the line of battle order (on a per class basis?)

But most weapons that fire in a straight line are effective for the whole
length of that straight line.  True, with slug throwers (CPR and gauss
weapons) range does have some effect, but not as much as it does on a
meson gun.  You have to know the exact range to the target so that you can
control the mesons\' velocity, so that they will go off inside the target.
Perhaps the meson gun\'s fire control would not be exactly the same as a
standard indirect fire control, but it would resemble an indirect fire
control more than it would resemble a direct fire control.

Yes.  That "perhaps not" was contrasting with the "... and perhaps meson
screens" in my list of what a TL 15 tank would carry.  In view of that
minimum size, I was accepting that the TL 15 tank would probably not
carry them.  Incidentally, what radius does the screen have?  Does it
just protect the hull of the vehicle which owns the screen, or can one
vehicle mounting a big screen cover an area, in which several other
vehicles would sit protected?

In any case, I would expect that the vehicle with the meson gun would sit
well back, out of harm\'s way.  Smaller, cheaper vehicles, perhaps drones,
would go into the forward battle area, trying to find enemy assets (vehicles,
troops, interesting buildings, etc.) and provide targetting information for
the meson gun.  Because of the requirement for precise ranging, I would
expect a meson gun to be less accurate than a laser, so if a tank with a
meson gun met a tank with a laser, the laser tank would have a better chance
of scoring the first hit.  So why risk the meson gun unnecessarily?

SO, what\'s the neutron flux from a 50 GW fusion plant?  Can it be shielded
from with less than 2500 metric tons of shielding?  If not, then kiss MT
fusion
plants goodbye, too.

Why do you assume that if it can\'t be built now, then it can\'t be built
ever?
I find the fusion gun ridiculous for other reasons:  it costs too much for
what it does.  If a RAM grenade will do it for Cr20, why spend KCr300 to do
it?  I do NOT believe that we (today, here on Terra) have learned all there
is to learn about the universe\'s workings, and I arbitrarily reject any
argument that assumes that what we know now is all there is.
People have objected to grav technology in MT for a variety of reasons,
almost
all coming down to a variation of "it doesn\'t agree with physics as we know
it".
Some people said that about Einstein\'s work, and some said it about quantum
physics later (Einstein, for one).  SOme even said it about Newton\'s work.
I see no reason to believe that physics has now reached the pinnacle of
knowledge,
or that ANYTHING in science fiction is impossible.  I will reserve
judgement
until it happens.  I DO assume that if the picture presented is INTERNALLY
consistent that there is no reason to mess with it.
 
Notice that MT assumes that TL14+ technology can build a fusion plant of
100
liters (and 300Kg).  It follows that they have methods of shielding against
neutrons that we don\'t.  If we reject fusion guns as feasible in MT, then
we 
should also reject fusion plants smaller than 1GW (I doubt we could build 
one that light today), nuclear dampers, meson technology, superdense
materials, 
jump drive, grav technology, maneuver drive (replace with chemical rockets
or 
NERVA, which we know work, all else is guesswork), personal lasers, battle 
dress (we can\'t make batteries that small), etc, etc.  If you eliminate the

science fiction elements, why play a science fiction game?  If you keep any

science fiction elements, why throw out things that are, at least,
internally
consistent?
 
I have found that all the MT (and Traveller) campaigns I have played in
have
managed to avoid paying attention to FGMPs and PGMPs by paying attention to
Law Levels.  If the solution is that simple, why bother with anything else?
And if your PCs flout the law a lot, feel free to have the SWAT teams blow 
them away till they get the hint.
 
 
And if you really can\'t stand FGMPs, drop them, but don\'t try to explain it
as "impossible".  It probably isn\'t.  (at MT prices, it probably isn\'t
WORTH doing, but it is probably possible to do,if one had a reason and 3000
years of prior research).

combined by a factor of 1.5.  In the game I played in, Esperanza proceeded
to conquer it\'s neighbors, then everyone else inside 10 years.  Even a
(short-lived) alliance between all the other players didn\'t slow down their
progress in any meaningful way}.  Assume Esperanza is B-6748BC-9, and that
they have no off-planet holdings for campaign planning.

New Home IS acceptable, however.  That will leave you a fairly severe
handicap in production, but the Tech Level should make up the difference.

I don\'t plan to handicap the game, so send me your three top choices, and
I\'ll try to find you something acceptable.
Game length is 100 years, or until the Island Clusters are under a single
government.  Victory is determined by population controlled, if the game
lasts till the century mark.

If you decide to start fleet design early, use standard TCS guidelines, but
NO MESON TECHNOLOGY IS AVAILABLE.  The starting condition is "peace".

Given enough resources, you can build a sensor that cannot be hidden from.
I doubt that the average ship captain-PC has more resources than the
average 
planetary government.  As to going beyond sensor range, I suspect that any
world higher than TL8 will have system range sensors that track everything 
in the system.  In which case, you\'ll spend a LOONG time getting beyond
sensor range.  I also suspect that when your transponder stops sending a 
detectable signal (just after you jump), they\'ll realize you jumped (or
were
destroyed), and be waiting with a fleet of Customs people when you return.
I also suspect that transponders and flight recorders are checked
frequently,
and anything you do had better have a faked transponder/recorder record
that
won\'t be cracked when the daily report of traffic in nearby systems is 
brought in by X-boat.  Or by Courier, in systems off the X-boat routes.

A while ago, folks were talking about trying to build the equivalent of the
Battle tech monsters in MegaTrav.  Well, if you ask me they would be sitting
ducks for any high tech A-10 equivalent, and probably even the good ol A-10
would give em a run for their money if it were equipped with specially
designed missiles.  But that is only my opinion.

However smaller stuff might be usable in close combat type situations.
Thus here are some Low Tech models of battle dress.

The problem with building these things (And all of the MegaTrav Robots)
is their lack of upper body strength.  For instance, the AB-101 robot has
a strength of 15 and a weight of several hundred Kilos.  He could never
be expected to be able to haul himself up by his arms.  And if you ask me,
if he were knocked down, I doubt he could stand up without a crane to assist
him.  These units suffer the same problems.  But then again, maybe AB was
designed with some sort of booster specifically for the action of standing
up after a tumble.  If so, then these would have the same booster.

Maximum dexterity is limited to the normal dexterity of the user, but is
normally lower.  Use the formula:
Dexterity=(TL-8) + Dexterity of User/5 + Battle Dress Skill.

I did not include a computer in this, but the rules in 101 vehicles do allow
for this.
Some have pointed out a while ago that Fuel Cells are available only at TL 10.
Well, we can build them today actually, (Mercury?, Gemini, Apollo)
Thus I don\'t think it unreasonable to have one at TL 9.  Still, for the purists
I made a TL 9 version with a Fuel Cell and one with batteries.
Closed cycle operation would reduce duration to 20 days for the Fuel celled
versions.

Control of the unit is maintained by a HUD in the helmet.  Touch sensors
mounted inside the suit will sense the movement of the user and so articulate
the suit.

I kinda pictured these as armed and armored versions of the cargo lifter from
Aliens:  Big, Strong, Nasty, but on the clumsy side.

Have fun!

    From: rwmira01@vlsi.ct.louisville.edu (Rob):
    
    >There is yet another solution.  You could back off of the GDW
    officialness of the rebellion a little (not much mind you).  There
    is room spinward of the Spinward Marches where the Zhondani have
    not expanded rimward and the Aslan have not expanded coreward.
    Right next to the Marches, that corridor is quite thin, however it
    does open up some a few sectors out.  (Look at the adventure
    Laviathan (sp) for references).  There has been plenty of
    unexplored turf to mess with.

I take the official Imperium maps as ending at the edges of the Atlas
of the Imperium, and have indeed selected the very area you mention
for an unexplored region.  There is (in my maps) a thread of systems
(forming a Jump-2 main) running to spinward from Darrian/Five Sisters,
which puts a big enough gap to coreward to avoid any Zhodani
influence, and a similar one to rimward to keep the Aslan out.  This
thread leads to a sector with a dense cluster of worlds which are
unexplored by humans, which is where my players are right now.

I have totally backed off the rebellion, as I find that setting a game
at the fall of a civilisation, with lots of warring factions, to be
restrictive to the players (and the GM).  To me, Traveller is a
setting where the characters can do pretty much whatever they want,
and can move from being simple merchants to investigating intrigue to
being agents for the Imperium explorers to fighting in an interstellar
war (not involving the Imperium directly) to being pirates raiding
alien merchant traffic, to take my current campaign as an example.  I
think that having a strong stable Imperium behind them drives the
characters to much more interesting development than if they were
pawns in petty squabbles between Imperial nobles.

Why was there no rebellion?  Easy.  There was no Fifth Frontier War to
spark egos and power struggles among the nobles.  Archduke Norris came
to power in the Spinward Marches as a result of his actions in
preventing war, using evidence of advance preparations by the Sword
Worlds and the Zhodani to get them to back down.  (Yes, characters in
a previous campaign discovered that evidence, investigating ship
losses in the Zaibon system.)  Relations (and mutual respect) with the
Zhodani have improved greatly since then, again due greatly to the
diplomacy of Norris, while the Sword Worlds have returned to their old
internal conflicts and are no longer a useful ally for anyone.

So it is now 1118, and the Imperium is as strong as ever.  This moves
the focus of adventurous characters from internal conflict to
exploring the bounds of the Imperium.
    
    >The real problem that I have is with the world generation.  It is
    built on assuming that a thriving interstellar community exists.
    A little creative thought can go a long way in interpreting the
    data from the UWP.  High TLs and starports are hard to justify,
    but could.

I solve this the same way I do many other consistency problems one
comes across in a long campaign: I wing it.  I generate the star
systems and world data (based on World Builders Hbk) with a SAS
programme, print out the whole sector, stick it in a binder and
scribble all over it in pencil when I disagree with the data.  I have
quite frequently taken a high population system and declared it to be
uninhabited.  Since I also have made _Hard Times_-like changes to
systems in a war zone (again, winging it rather than using any
specific system, based on what I "know" about what has happened in the
system) this process is essential to my campaign.
    
    >The other factor that can be used is the fact that a majority of
    the worlds outside of the Imperium were mapped from long range by
    the IISS during the first grand survey and that information may
    not be completly accurate.

And in many cases was not done at all.  The J2-main from Darrian to
spinward, for example :-).

I don\'t claim to be up on the current thinking of physicists, but why is
fusion such a huge a SOURCE of neutrons?  I thought that the basic type
of fusion we\'ve been talking about was 2 D -> 1 He or 1 T + 1 H -> 1 He
or some similar reaction where a hydrogen isotope is converted into
helium.  Since there\'s a lot more hydrogen than deuterium or tritium, I\'d
think that if anything the fusion process would need EXTRA neutrons.  Is
it really a neutron SINK (for lack of a better term)?

Assuming FFW rules, here is my initial idea for how things could work.
Each turn consists of:

1.  Reinforcement Selection Phase.  The GM tells each player what
reinforcements have become available this turn.  Each player then
tells the GM what he is doing with his replacement points.  In a
non-refereed game, each player sends the other a list of what
reinforcements and replacements are entering play this turn.

2.  Movement Phase:
 A. Discretionary Movement.  Both players inform the GM of their
 discretionary moves (X-boats, scouts, fleets led by admirals with
 plotting factor 0).  In a non-refereed game, one player sends the
 other all his discretionary moves, then the second player sends
 the first player his list of discretionary moves.  Either the players
 take it in turns to go first, or they agree not to read the message
 with the title "Discretionary moves" until they have sent their own
 such message.

 B. Plotted Movement.  Both players inform the GM, or each other if
 there is no GM, of their plotted movements for this turn.

3.  Combat Phase:
 A. Black Globe Step.  If the optional black globe rules are being
 played, players owning fleets containing only black globe squadrons
 tell the GM, or each other, what special actions (if any) those fleets
 are carrying out.

 B. Space Combat.  This is the tricky one, if disengaging from a combat
 is to be allowed.  I suggest that for each round of space combat, each
 player sends the GM, or the other player, a list of 4 die rolls.  The
 GM or player will then have a list of 4 rolls for each side.  These
 rolls are used as the rolls for the corresponding side on the combat
 tables.  A fleet may disengage when all 4 rolls have been applied, or
 on the round that a set of rolls results in the fleet\'s firepower being
 shifted down by one column on the table.  The battle ends when one side
 has been destroyed or has disengaged.  For quicker battles, more than
 4 rolls can be sent per message; for more precise resolution, fewer rolls
 can be sent.  The number of rolls must be agreed on before the battle
 commences.  For the sake of speed, all space combats occurring in a turn
 can be run in parallel.

 C. Interface combat.
  a. System Defence.  The defending player tells the attacker, and the
  GM if present, if the system\'s SDB\'s are active this turn.  If so,
  the combat between them and the attacking fleet is resolved the same
  way as Space Combat above.
  b. Surface Bombing.  The player who owns any squadrons or SDB\'s in a
  system sends either the bombing rolls for this turn, or a message
  saying "No bombing" or something to that effect.  Again, all bombing
  on all worlds is resolved in the same message exchange.
  c. Space-Surface Transfers.  Players exchange messages with the GM, or
  with each other, stating what troops are being loaded/unloaded on all
  worlds.

 In any system, only one side will be able to do bombing, and only that
 side will be able to do transfers.  Thus, the message containing bombing
 results can also contain the space-surface transfers.

 D. Surface combat.  On all worlds containing troops from both sides,
 one die roll is made for the combat occurring that turn.  All die rolls
 can be sent in the same message.
 
4.  Plotting and Reorganisation Phase.
Players do not tell each other about their plotting and reorganisation.
They tell the GM, if there is one.  The status of guerillas is declared
to the other player, and to the GM.

5.  End of turn.  There are no secrets in victory points, so everyone
can calculate them.  If someone thinks he has an automatic victory, he
says so.  If not, tough.  Just to give everyone an incentive to get out
their calculators, I suggest that if a player does not claim an automatic
victory, he does not get it, and the GM is not obliged to point it out -
just to check and enforce or reject the claim.  Otherwise, the Zhodani
player may claim a unilateral armistice; or either player may ask the
other for an armistice, which may be rejected.  If there is no automatic
victory or armistice, go back to phase 1.

Sure, some systems will do this, but systems which have a C or less starport
will more likely not.  What is the range of a transponder, anyway?  I\'m
assuming the transponder range is less then interplanetary.

X Boat???  We\'re talking about different animals here.  The only xboats the

I suspect the Zhodani consider their core expeditions too secret to
let  the Imperium help out, even if the Imperium wanted to.

??? Laser range finders can do wonders for your ranging shots.  And a meson

gun has an area of effect of 100m diameter, which means a high degree of
accuracy is not required.  If you can see the target, you can obliterate
it.

Correction noted.  I misunderstood.  A meson screen has any area you want 
it to, if you have the power available:  0.015MW per factor per Kl.  That 
works out to 15TW per Km^3.  Impractical to protect the battlefield, and
requires a BIG fusion plant to provide protection for even a company.

That\'s a reasonable mission profile for any high tech AFV.
However, unless the meson gun has a very long cycle time, it can bounce a 
ranging laser off the target and snapfire (using a point defense fire 
control) as fast as the laser tank can, and far more lethally (especially 
if the meson tank is also heavily armoured).
 
I notice that the battlefield meson gun was removed from the list of 
available weapons in MT.  Someone may have decided it didn\'t fit their
picture.  Someone may have just forgot, too.

Sorry, Steve, you walked right into that one. |-> The problem with FGMP
neutron flux is NOT shielding-- we must assume, BTW, a much smaller 
fusion plant than the minimum one allowed by the rules if we\'re going
to put it on a man\'s back, but I digress-- as we HAVE in fact postulated
a containment for fusion neutron flux that is light and efficient. (I,
for one, believe that a spherical focussed gravitic generator might make
a nifty bottle-- it uses SF science that we\'ve already forgiven. I have
NOT tried to work out the power required to generate a grav field capable
of neutron deflection etc etc etc CYA CYA, but there are ways to handwave
around this without damaging the rules.)

The problem with FGMPs is that while the fusion vessel is shielded nicely
from hurting anyone, it then proceeds to gob fusing plasma on whomever it\'s
pointed at when GI Joe pressed the red button marked "MAKE DEAD". And if 
fusion is still going on at that point, THEN you get a massive release of
utterly unshielded neutrons causing all sorts of subcellular mayhem.

And no, the proton-proton chain, if 100% efficient, does not release any
neutrons. But D-T fusion, as used in Traveller, releases TONS of them.
This drags us back to the TDR discussion-- what do Traveller fusion 
reactors FUSE? The HIWG says one thing, other people say another, and
I personally favor a third....

A few notes on the Low tech battle dress I sent in last night.

Those models are more like space capsules than battle dress.  That is, you
don\'t \'put them on\' you climb into them.  I allowed 200+ liters for the
operator.  The average human being about the density of water (Ok, Ok, I\'m so
skinny I SINK!) And the average human is WAY under 200 Kg.  Thus it\'s not
a tight fit.  I envisioned a strap in type set up like on the cargo loader in
aliens with clamshell armored plates to cover the occupant.
	The joints must be adjusted to the user to allow for different limb
lengths, torso size etc.  These adjustments are rather simple with the
\'cook book\' instructions, and can be fitted to different users in fairly short
order by non-experts.  (Battle Dress-0)  All that really gets adjusted are
a few clamps so that the arms and legs telescope to the proper length.
The unit\'s mechanical hands are linked to the operators hands, but not directly
so no major difference in hand size is a problem.  Because of this, it is
nearly IMPOSSIBLE to determine the sex of the wearer, unless the visor is up
(And even then it can be trouble)  (Unless of course somebody decides to paint
their battle dress pink or blue...)

	The magazine and fuel tank are constructed like a shaped charge.  If
they became ignited the force of the explosion is directed away from the
occupant.  This is similar to the way magazines are constructed on our current
tanks.

A few people may have been surprised, (I sure was) when I didn\'t pick up the
gauntlet to play Trillion Credit Squadron.  Sorry, I don\'t have the time now,
but I\'d sure like to try it sometime against all of you!

I was sort of pleased to see that you chose High Guard over MegaTrav.
Otherwise I was seeing all sorts of problems for you.

I once got started in a TCS campaign with MegaTrav and it never got very far.
(sigh)

Announcing Kellogg\'s Law!
The larger the design system, the easier it is to find NASTY loopholes in it.
The MEgaTrav design system is pretty Large!

The trillion cred Squadron I was gonna build was gonna revolve around the
Indianapolis Fighter and the Wolf II fighter carrier.  (TL 11)

The Indianapolis fighter (for those of you who don\'t remember it) is an
incredibly cheap (Under 10 MCR if memory serves) COACC designed fighter
using a Fusion Rocket.  It\'s acceleration was around 12G\'s with a full
armament load.  She carried 60 anti-ship missiles which would be fired in
two battery rounds.  Thus she had the equivalent of a factor 7 missile battery.

At the speeds these things go, they could streak into range, fire the first
salvo, then fly along with the missiles and fire the second salvo.  Then
streak out of range before the enemy had much time to fire on them.
(also with agitlity 6 and a model 5 computer and the +2 size DM they were hard
to hit!)

THus the enemy had not one round of missiles coming in, but 2 rounds which
would come in on the same round and swamp the defending batteries.

The fighters could then fly back to the carriers (Which were WELL out of range)
and reload.

The cheapness of these fighters was one of their biggest advantages.  with
a few thousand of them in the air, they could dish out damage in a HURRY.

It\'s true, against nuclear dampers and heavy armor, they mightn\'t fare as well,
but remember that a non penetration hit still registers as hull damage.
(YEah! Those silly numbers we NEVER use!)  And think, a thousand fighters
fire 60 thousand missiles...  I don\'t care if you\'ve got armor 200H!  It\'s
still gonna hurt ya!

Now, I hear the gentlemen in the back row making noise...
But Hey!  It\'s allowed under MegaTrav Rules!

So... be GLAD you\'ve got High Guard to save you from me and my big mouth!

But someday when I\'m not taking quantum physics, I\'d like to see what some of
you can turn out in a MegaTrav or High Guard Fleet, just to test out what I
can turn out!  Heh! Heh! Heh! Heh! Heh!

And Steve Higginbotham:
>Sounds like a good idea to me.  How do we get started?

Perhaps I should start by outlining what I\'ve already done, and
what I hope to finish up with in the end.

I\'ve taken the Beyond and Vanguard Reaches starmaps (from the
Paranoia Press publications) and thrown out practically
everything except the star positions and a few of the names. I
then took the starmap in _Vilani & Vargr_ and enlarged Foreven
Sector enough to make out which hex what star belongs to. I\'m
sure I\'ve made some mistakes, but hopefully not all that many
(One sub-sector  -  Urnian, the one directly spinwards of Five
Sisters  -  I had made up randomly years earlier, so that one
dosen\'t correspond to GDW\'s version at all).
I then worked out the political boundaries shown on the V&V map
as best I could. There\'s one fairly big realm stretching across
5 or 6 subsectors that is called \'Die Weltbund\' (German for
\'Federation of Worlds\') by Paranoia Press. I decided to make
that my \'staging area\', the civilized provider of technology,
R&R and patrons. Most of what I\'ve done till now has been in
connection with Weltbund. I have a rough idea of the first 3
centuries of settlement (2nd to 4th after the Imperial Calendar),
a sketchy timeline, names and UPPs for some of the worlds and
some ideas about the dominant culture (the Navy is sorta like
the Napoleonic Era English Navy with German sounding ranks ;-).

As for the unknown, I\'ve retroactively wiped out the governments
of roughly 7 subsectors of Vanguard Reaches and Beyond and inflicted
THE NOMADS (drumroll, please) on them:

Library data:

"NOMAD DOMAIN:  Area roughly comprised of subsectors H, K and L
of VANGUARD REACHES and subsectors E, F, G and I of BEYOND. The
area is dominated by a unique starfaring nomadic culture. Seven
_hordes_ have divided the area\'s systems between them and lives
by exhorting what they need from the planetary populations.  If
they  encounter  resistance  they  bomb a part of the offending
planet down to TL 0, which usually makes the rest of the planet
toe  the  line.  They  stay  for  a year or two in each system,
and  then  continue on to the next system.  Before they leave a
system they destroy as much of the local manufacturing capacity
as  possible,  to  ensure  that the system will not grow strong
enough to defy them when they return in 15 or 20 years.  Rumour
has  it  that  in the few cases where a planet has succeeded in
keeping  a  horde  at bay,  word have been sent to other hordes
which  thereupon have sent their own forces to help,  resulting
in the complete defeat and rape of the planet in question."


I plan to open up the Domain by having Weltbund (aided by the Imperium)
trap and destroy most of the nomad fighting ships. Sufficient ships will
survive to be able to trouble Weltbund and PCs for many a year, but the
intrepid merchant (or survey team) will be able to penetrate where no
non-nomad has flown for a millennium. Furthermore, the nomads have been
a barrier to contact with the systems on the other side (the rest of
Vanguard Reaches). Some knowledge has seeped around the edges, of course,
but those systems are pretty much terra (or terras :-) incognita. With the
breaking of the nomads, merchants suddenly become interested in knowing
about them. Exploration parties could be sent out, but I have no particular
ideas about what\'s there.

What I would like is to expand this sketchy outline into a full-fledged
campaign background. My ideas about how are rather vague. Perhaps each
of us interested parties could select one bit of the whole to work on
and I could coordinate the efforts?

I could e-mail the timeline and the world names and UPPs that I have so
far, but there\'s already a fair amount of data, so I don\'t think I should
post it.

I\'ve already developed Weltbund to a point where these wouldn\'t fit, but
there\'s plenty of room for them elsewhere on the Frontier. I like the idea.

Sounds neat too. But my problem isn\'t so much neat ideas (though you can
never have too many of those :-) as sheer time to work out the tedious
details (No wait, that didn\'t come out right: the details aren\'t tedious,
but working them out can be; I don\'t enjoy ship design too much, for
example, but I love having deckplans to show my players).

Meson guns are too much like fun!  Players are not supposed to enjoy

The design isn\'t quite moot, the combat tactics are.  You are still going to

lots of work for the referee--for this reason, as well as the time lag 
mentioned before, perhaps one turn every other day might be better?

Will unclaimed planets with Class B ports have navies for self defence?

Can players purchase/capture/conquer ships from a higher tech level than what
they started with?  This will undoubtably be of great concern for New Home.

I would prefer not to have any restrictions on classes of ships or over-
simplification of combat system.  This would detract too much from ship design
and tactical decisions.

To resolve combat in one round of messages, everyone should give standing 
orders for their fleets that Steve could use to resolve what would happen in
battle.  For instance, when to retreat, what weapons to use on what type of
target, etc.  New orders would be transmitted by courier ship, thus encouraging
players to get it right the first time!

to cover a planet. However, I cannot remember the distance at which these ships
were supposed to be operating from the planet. I am going to assume a distance
of 10 planetary diameters for this discussion, for three reasons: (1) ships
coming into the system will be 100 or more diameters out, so the protective
ships will be between the intruders and the planet, (2) ships leaving the
system will be unlikely to jump until they get at least that magical 10
diameters out (unless really foolhardy or desperate), so the protective ships
have time to intercept the target ships (such ships are usually smugglers or
escaping criminals), and (3) with \'x\' ships, it means that the ships have less
of an area to cover, thus improving effectiveness, than if they were at 100
diameters. With this being said, with an earth-sized world, it will take a 6G
fighter over *2 hours* to get from the 10 to 100 diameter ranges. This is more
than enough time for the hostile ship to do what it wants way out there. A few
\'first-line-of-defense\' ships at 100 diameters might help, but unless you have
half the Sector Navy at hand, you won\'t be able to put more than a token number
of ships at the 100 diameter range (of course, a few Q-freighters would help).

Hmmm... It NEVER occurred to me that fusion might still be going on after
the plasma stream (DON\'T cross the streams.  It wuold be bad.) left the
weapon.  I always assumed the fusion took place for a nanosecond or so in
the barrel, then stopped when the stream left the containment of the
barrel.

Where does it say Traveller does D-T fusion?  This would definitely affect
certain ongoing processes in our campaign.

As you probably notice, Esperanza has been removed from the list of 
starfaring powers.  The list of eligible worlds is limited to those with
A starports, but if you really like a challenge, I have no objection to
you playing St. Hilaire or Colchis.  For purposes of this game, you will
be the "High Command" of whichever world you get, and your location IS 
relevant.  Any orders given will be from whatever point you are determined
to be at when the order is given, and appropriate time delays till the
order
is received will be applied.  
You will be required to build a fleet using standard TCS guidelines for
"peace".  No meson technolgy is initially available.  You  must provide me
with a complete fleet listing (in High Guard terms).  80% of that force,
to include all the (TL-1) ships, will be included in initial information to
all other players.  80% of their forces will be known to you.  You may 
indicate WHICH ships are to included in that listing.  Any further 
information must be acquired during play.  Communication between players
must go through me, and will be delivered at the appropriate time.
 
Each player should provide me a short (less than 1000 words) description
of his Naval Doctrine (how do you want your fleets to behave in a fight?).
Combats between forces you are not present at will be decided by me, and 
results will be sent to you at the appropriate time.  You may change Naval 
Doctrine at any time, but the change will be disseminated to your forces at
the appropriate times.  They will continue to use old Doctrine until that 
time.
 
"Appropriate time" will be determined by time required to make jumps from 
the location an event occurs at to the relevant locations (you to your
fleets,
your fleets to you, other worlds to you, etc.).
 
There are no "bidding guidelines".  Choose the three worlds you would most 
prefer to operate from.  I will try to keep everyone as happy as possible.
The sooner you get a request in, the more likely you are to get your first 
choice, though.

To answer questions already asked - 80% is by tonnage, not by cost.
I am you comptroller.  Any budgetary errors or overrruns will be reported
at the "appropriate time".  Deficit spending is disallowed, funds will
awarded annually (every 50 turns).
Worlds listed as having a Navy Base have planetary defenses other in
addition to fleets (this, of course, applies only to non-player worlds. 
Players can do what they like about planetary defenses).  ANY world with
sufficient resources may have a fleet (mostly quite small).  These ships
will be assumed to be produced at the tiny little local yards, or bought
surplus from one of the great powers.  This IS a method that can be used to
dispose of obsolete ships you no longer wish to carry on the fleet list. 
50% of funds so acquired will go to the Navy budget for the following year,
the remainder to the General Fund (it pays the Comptroller\'s salary ;-)).

A few weeks ago I mentioned that I was working on fixing the Hard Times

part of this.  It\'s not all done, but the game-design parts are.
Notably missing are costs and power in and out and several items
such as Ion engines I haven\'t had a chance to evaluate completely

Reviser\'s Notes:
I\'ve broken liquid fuel engines into three categories:  "normal" liquid
fuel engines, running on some hydrocarbon (usually kerosene or a rough
equivalent) and Liquid Oxygen (LOX), "hypergolic" liquid fuel engines,
running on something like Nitrogen Tetroxide and Hydrazine, and "Liquid
Hydrogen" rockets, runnong on LOX and Liquid Hydrogen.
 
Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.  Normal liquids are reliable
and cheap and low-tech.  Liquid Hydrogen improves performance at the cost
of reliability, something which I\'m striving to write some rules for.
Hypergolics are the most reliable (and cheapest, engine wise), but the
fuels are excessively toxic and hard to handle (remember that Titan silo
that blew up around 1985 ?).
 
I\'ve added Hybrids, where a liquid oxidizer and a solid fuel are burned in
a thrust chamber sort of like a solid rocket engine.  These need more
work, and I\'m doing it, but right now a real-world hybrid engine rocket
design of mine is eating my time and such 8-) so don\'t expect it soon.
 
All of the listed values correspond with known specific impulse, barring
mathematical error while I was calculating them (I spot checked a few and
they\'re right, so they in general are pretty close).

Enjoy. 8-)

> FFW is mostly a two person game, also

One of my friends ran a FFW pbm game for about 10 people by
making them the top five Imperial and the top five Zhodani
admirals respectively. The rest of the admirals were run
by him. He imposed the obvious information time lag, but the
player admirals were not required to plot ahead, of course.
He used the whole Spinward Marches map, but I can\'t recall
wether he introduced more squadrons for the rimward subsectors.
I wasn\'t involved myself, unfortunately, but he and several of
his players have told me that it worked well and was a lot of
fun.


I\'ve been contemplating doing something similar when my campaign
reaches 1116 (When that will be is anybody\'s guess. Current time
is 1113 and I\'ve had to suspend the campaign for lack of time :-( ).
What I\'d like to do is to get 16-20 people involved: 2-3 top
political and 4-5 top naval characters for the Domain, one each
to run the Darrians, Sword Worlds, Border Worlds and Federation of
Arden, 3 or 4 aslan clan chiefs (_rival_ Aslan clanchiefs ;-)), the
Zhodani Governor of Chronor and whoever else I can think of (one
Imperial would definitely be the admiral of the Five Sisters forces).
Vargr forces would be handled by a semi-referee, not a regular player.
Interaction would be diplomatic as well as military.

Sigh! There\'s no earthly or unearthly chance that I\'ll ever have the
time to actually run such a monster, but I can dream, can\'t I? :-)


> RE: NOMADS

Yes, a little. Primarily they are a plot device to keep a sizable
slice of space incommunicado until the PCs can get a chance to
explore where no-one they\'ve ever heard of has gone before.

Steve Higginbotham:
> I assumed the transponder range was system, at least.

That makes sense. However, in my universe the authorities are
not quite as hysterical about transponders as they are in the
official one. There\'s just too many legitimate corporations
that wishes to keep some of their business secret from
competitors for the authorities to get too hardnosed about it.
Transponders can be switched off (official excuse: so as not to
reveal our presense to pirates) and will often, Imperial
regulations to the contrary notwithstanding, be switched on only if
you are within range of an official ship or expect to be before
you jump out of the system (that is, you\'re going to land on
the planet). The penalty for having a switched-off transponder
is often only a fine, especially for first offenders. Mind you,
the authorities will propably enforce the regulations a lot
more leniently for a megacorporate ship than for a suspected
smuggler.

One thing that would help pirates survive would be to be able to hide
more effectively. Could we reduce the effectiveness of neutrino
detectors? After all, how _do_ you detect the direction of a neutrino?
The presense of more than can be accounted for by background radiation,
sure, but the direction to the source? I suspect that you\'d need
statistical analysis of readings from widely scattered detectors. And
even then you\'ll be quite handicapped the moment you get more than a
couple of fusion plants in the system. How does a 12 ship squadron
detect a 13th ship halfway across the system? Then too the pirate can
reduce output from his power plant. One more thing: could you use a
nuclear damper to screen neutrino emissions? (Look, my knowledge of
nuclear physics is not  --  how shal I put this?  --  not Nobel Prize
level ;-)

merchant marine, at a fairly significant speed penalty.
 
Planetary defenses:  If you don\'t build them, you won\'t have them.  I am
not
using much abstraction for the planetary assault parts of the game.  It
will
be abstract as far as you are concerned, since it will be handled at the
field
level, as opposed t High Command.  Army type units are not your concern, as

their budget comes from other sources, but transport for ground units IS 
within your zone of interest.  Merchant Marine transport will be available
in
nearly limitless quantities, AFTER the war zone ceases to be a war zone.
 
Doctrine:  Make it as long as necessary.  Keep in mind that you can issue
special orders to individual fleets/squadrons/ships, so your doctrine need
not cover EVERY situation imaginable.  Just most of them ;-)
 
SO far, everyone can have their first choice (you know who you are, and
what 
the choices are.  I need a few more players before we can get started,
since
I don\'t want to inflict MY idea of future war by neutrals on you.
 
Oh, yeah.  IN this campaign, B starports have yard capacities 50% of an A 
starport, but they can build only non-Jump capable stuff, or Jump capable
ships under 5000 tons (to a limit of 10% of their yard capacity).
 
Keep in mind that fleets acting independently are being run by high-grade
morons.  They can make tactical decisions, but no strategic decisions 
not based in their orders.
 
ANd ONe more thing:  I\'m doing an extended system writeup for all systems
(I\'ve needed one for these systems in our own game).  You\'ll have to defend
(and attack) complete solar systems, not just one gas giant and your 
main world.  System writeups for your systems will be provided in a few 
days, system writeups for any other systems will be provided on request
(probably pkzipped, and UUencoded, so if you can\'t handle that, let me
know).

Hmmm...
I said that about twelve ships defending a planet.
The assumed positions were at 50 diameters.  The average imperial world is
size 5, which means that 50 diameters is 400,000 Km.  Since shipboard 
weaponry has a range of 500,000 Km, all twelve ships could bring low 
planetary orbit under fire.  Presumably six ships could bring any point
in low planetary orbit under fire.  In addition, at least one ship could 
bring any point at 100 diameters under fire.  At least eleven ships could
fire on any point at the ten diameter limit.
 
Therefore, these defensive installations do not have to intercept any ships
appearing at the 100 diameter limit.  They just blow away any ship that 
does not comply with traffic control orders.  SO, yu act like a pirate
with-
in 100 diameters, between one and twelve LARGE ships blow you away 
immediately.  Intercept time, rather than being several hours, is only 
1.7 seconds.
 
It does not pay to forget that ship weaponry can target you at a range of 
500,000Km, which is 62.5 diameters of the average world, and 30+ diameters
of even the largest world.
 
In the case of a larger world, I assume that you would deploy a few more 
ships.  Using the basic assumptions I used,  a size \'A\' world requires 
96 ships to achieve the same coverage.
 
This defensive force is, of course, not suitable for dealing with enemy 
fleets, but will serve admirably against anyone so foolish as to commit
piracy nearby.
 
In fact, we have noticed that in heavily trafficked systems (Efate, 
Rhylanor,Trin, Mora come immediately to mind) that the normal merchant
traffic is dense enough that any pirate attack inside 100 diameters would
come under fire from as many as 200 merchant ships within range at any 
given instant (under Imperial laws requiring all vessels to render 
assistance).  At ranges much less than 100 diameters (ten say), that 
number would rise to perhaps 5000 ships capable of firing on any pirate.
Not counting any naval vessels in system at the time.

The 4.5th Frontier War
- ----

Just a few notes about background in the story:
Date:  1102.  Well before the 5th Frontier War.  Back in the old days of
Classic Trav :-)

Setting:
Iakr sector.  Foreven to you Imperials.  Just spinward of the Spinward Marches.
As far as I know, there never has been offical sector data for that sector.
The map I have is one I partially generated, and partially stole.  At the time,
I was finding a lot of worlds in Amber Zone articles that were not in the
Spinward Marches.  Thus I took all I could find and stuffed them in Foreven.
I took entire subsector maps from FASA & others.  Alien races were transported
lock stock and barrel from other sectors.
The Dynchia (JTAS 24?) are supposed to be on the other side of the Imperium!
Noteable stuff that got stolen:  Jungleblut subsector from FASA.  Horltheur
is a world that was outlined in Dragon Magazine.  Other subsectors got
mysteriously transported in from Reaver\'s Deep.  At least one world went
through a worm hole and came all the way from the Solomani Rim.

Characters:
Primarily Zhodani.  The other ref in our group had us constantly fighting the
Zho\'s.  I decided it was time for the Zho\'s to fight back. :-)

House Rules:  Psionic Variants
Not all my psionic rules quite mesh with standard Trav.  I made the
determination that a Teleport of exceptional strength can carry another person
on a teleport.  It\'s tiring, but it can be done.
	Also, if a character is trained in telepahy, awareness, and has some
medical training, that character can induce regeneration in another.  It costs
more, but it can be done.  The reasoning:  Well, the healer knows how to take
total control of their own body.  They can also read and send thoughts into
another mind.  Thus it seems acceptable that they could induce regeneration in
that person if the person was amenable to the psi contact.
	A person with awareness training can, given time, can change their
body by regeneration.  Thus, they could change their eye color, the length of
their legs, their fingerprints, their retinal patterns, etc. etc.  BUT, that
person can not suddenly regrow an arm in the blink of an eye.  Regrowth of
limbs takes special diets of protiens and stuff, and TIME.
	Also, awarness is a Very nice skill to find in ones lover...  Intimate
contact has a tendancy to funcion as a psi-boost in that it will allow psi
points to recover faster (though it does tend to reduce endurance slightly...)
(With psionic enhanced endurance in such situations, one runs into near
violations of the second law of thermodynamics...  Perpetual motion...)

Inconsistancies:
Well, I started writing this four years ago.  Since then, articles have been
published which contradict some of the assumptions I made in the writing.
Where possible I have tried to make corrections.  Where an assumption was
important to the plot or the make up of the characters, I did NOT change it.
For instance:  in 1988, as some have pointed out there are NO good drawings of
Vargr females.  I remeber a discussion on the list about that particular
point.  And I point out that at the time of writing, there was only ONE drawing
that was of a Vargr female that showed the rib cage at ALL.  It was not clear
what was there.  I will NOT re-write the story on that subject.
	Another thing, I know is inconsistant:  when the Darrians Alien
Module came out, it gave guidelines on creating Darrian-Aslans.  All it said
was to change the physical stats.  It said nothing about an Aslan subculture.
Thus (though it doesn\'t make MUCH difference in this story) I always assumed
that the Darrian-Aslans acted like Darrians.  There is no provision for male
Aslan who gets female skills.  It is not mentioned AT ALL.  I therefore assumed
that these Aslan had been TOTALLY caught under Darrian culture.  This was a
LOT of fun when I ran a male Aslan who carried a hand computer and was an
engineer with a strong interest in science!  He also was something of a
gambler, things got REALLY interesting when he got into a traditional Aslan
duel and made a wager on the outcome...  Traditional Aslan found him
Quite Strange.  (Zdeldi appears here in a very Minor role)
	Now, Cats & Rats says Darrian-Aslan follow the traditions of the Aslan.
(Sigh)

Undoubtedly, there are other things that don\'t quite click with MegaTrav as
we have come to know it.  Well... Tough!  But if any of you all find something
I haven\'t spotted, lemme know.

Thanks,
Scott Kellogg

a fusion rocket is pretty open-ended as far as performance, but I have
seen studies that concluded that a fusion rocket could have an Isp in

And why are you using liquid Xenon and such for your ion drives, instead

Perhaps the Zhodani would not let a full Imperial squadron participate.
However, I can not believe that I am the only one who read the adventure
supplied with the old Zhodani Alien Module.  In that, Core expeditions
were heavily influenced by "visions" which some suitably psionically
gifted Zhodani had received, these "visions" being effectively messages
from the Ancients.  One of these "visions" specifically showed humans,
i.e. Imperial type humans.  So a Zhodani noble went and kidnapped a few
Imperials to bring along.  The "vision" did not show the humans as
prisoners - in fact, it showed them having a significant role in the
expedition.  Translation into game terms: the PC\'s are grabbed and
taken along, and allowed as much freedom as possible.

As I hope I showed, a PBEM FFW game should be possible even without a
referee (although not as good, since "fog of war" would not be possible).

If you do, please count me in!  I ought to be able to handle Admiral
Santanocheev reasonably accurately. :-)  (For those of you who have
FFW, he\'s one of the ones with Plotting Factor 4, Tactical Factor -1.
For those of you who don\'t have FFW, this means the fleet is better
off with no admiral than with this one.  He also has the authority to
take command of any fleet that makes the mistake of coming near him.  :-)

Seriously though, I would be interested in such a game.  I would
probably be better as one of the minor characters (a lesser Imperial
admiral, or an Aslan or Vargr warlord), because of email lag times
due to me being in the U.K., and me not being next to a terminal 24
hours a day.

Not 24 hours a day, but during the evening at least.  I think the point is
moot, though, as Steve wants all the communications to go through him.

"The design isn\'t quite moot, the combat tactics are.  You are still going to
have to trade things off in the design stages since you can never afford

If your fleet is evaluated to a number used to resolve the combat in one fell
swoop, how you design or fight the ship is irrelevant.

Steve:

"Don\'t WE have a C or less starport?  I assumed he transponder range was
system, at least."

Yeah, but we can\'t/don\'t track everything everywhere in the system...
We might be able to find a given object/transponder if we were looking for it.
Space is big, really BIG.  System control \'could\' keep track of every ship in
the system, but many uncivilized systems don\'t bother.
 
"I play in uncivilized systems so seldom that that aspect had never occurred to

How will you handle planet captures in general?  Will we be able to build ships

I\'d like to point out that we have demonstrated greater than 1000Km
accurate range on Earth.  We have, in fact, demonstrated that we can
hit a stationary target on the moon with a laser.  We did not show we
could make a weapon against ships then, but if you can do it at TL7, 
doing it at TL12+ should be geedunk.
I personally doubt a missile accurate at that range.  6Gs for 500,000Km
requires a deltaV of 245Km/s.  Which I suggest is impossible for a non-
grav powered missile.  Using W.G. Herbert\'s solid fuel guidelines from
this weekend, a missile with a twenty Kilogram warhead would mass about
160,000,000,000 solar masses.  Using grav the missile would mass 3333Kg, 
and cost MCr1.3525.  At higher TLs, the missile could be brought in under  
100Kg (as long as guidance masses 0), but at a cost of KCr50 or so.  At
still higher TLs, you can finally build the generic Traveller missile:
It only masses 50Kg (INCLUDING guidance package), but costs KCr185+.
In the above calculations, I rounded in favour of the consumer:  these 
missiles would actually be larger and more expensive than indicated (by
10-30%, depending on which missile you look at). Notice also that the 
proper mass  for a MT missile warhead is 30Kg, not 20Kg.  If you want
to actually produce an MT missile, increase all of the above by 50%.
And don\'t forget the guidance package on all but the last.
 
I personally believe in missiles having a relatively short range, with
a lot of bang (nuclear).  I prefer lasers and particle beams for long
range work.  It\'s easier to build a laser that can reach that far than 
a missile that does so within MT\'s specs.
 
PS.  flight time to 500,000Km for a missile is closer to an hour plus.

    'body' => 'Looking once again at the 1000Km range ship weapons, I noticed something of
interest to all those pirates out there:  

Imagine you are a pirate hanging around the 100 diameter limit of a size 5
world.  You detect a merchant leaving orbit.  His course is 30 degrees away
from your position.  You ignore him, since it would take longer for you to
match course and velocity than it takes him to reach the 100 diameter
limit.

Later on, a merchant ship leaves orbit, heading 20 degrees away from your
position.  Your eyes light up.  THIS one you can catch.  Well, you could
have if he hadn\'t left orbit two minutes before you noticed him.  oh well,
better luck next time.

Then, it happens! A merchant leaves orbit pointing STRAIGHT AT YOU!  This
one you may be able to catch!  You leave your position, and accelerate
toward a meeting.  After three hours of maneuvering which looks like
nothing so much as a pirate trying to match course, you match course with
your target.  Well, you WOULD have matched course, if he hadn\'t detected
you one hour into your maneuvers.  Actually, he changed course and returned
to the starport to get an escort.  Better luck next time, eh?

You cudgel your tiny little brain for some advantage that will let you
catch the next merchant.  The LIGHT dawns!  You need a 6G ship!  This one
can be converted with a few months in a shipyard, so you slip away to have
the conversion done.  It\'ll only cost MCr110 to complete the conversion. 
Hmmm....
Maybe we should think of some other way to do this?  Deceptive maneuvering?
No, your ship can barely catch them if you race straight at them, much less
maneuver to make it less obvious.  EMM??? Costs only MCr27, but still a
little
pricy, seeing as how you haven\'t scored in months.  Move to a size 1 world?
That would work!  Of course there are only 23 of them in the Spinward
Marches, and only 4 of those have enough traffic to pay expenses.  Well,
maybe the other pirates will let you work one of those systems.  Of course,
there are 1700 pirates preying on each of those systems, so you\'ll have to
take a number and wait your turn, but you should have something for your
pains in a year or two, when your turn comes.

Notes: 
1)  It takes 3.5 hours to reach 100 diameters from a size 5 world, if you
do not decelerate to a stop (which makes very little sense, anyway).
2)  From a point directly ahead of a target\'s course, it takes three hours
at three gees to match course and position within 1000Km.
3)  This gives you ten minutes to decide to attack, and then one combat
turn of attacks before your target jumps away.
4)  Normal starship sensors can detect a ship far enough away to make sure
that it won\'t EVER catch you, if you just have to reach 100 diameters, or
the starport (whichever is most convenient).
5)  A starship trying to match course like that is UNMISTAKABLY trying to
match course.  It would require considerably more than three gees to give
it time for deceptive maneuvering.  Even so, it would take over an hour of
maneuvering within easy view of the target (and everyone else) to match
position.  That entire hour of maneuver would be an obvious attempt to
match course, and could be met by a jump at more than ten diameters, if
necessary.
6)  so, a pirate will never accomplish anything with weapons like that.

Go through yur rules books.  Find every mention of minimum jump distances.
Add a zero to the end.  Change 10 diameters to 100.  Change 100 to 1000.
Don\'t forget solar diameter in figuring jump points.  Using this system,
Sol\'s
jump point would be out near Saturn\'s orbit.  
Go through again.  Increase the effective sensor ranges by a factor of ten,
too.  If you don\'t no pirate will ever FIND a target out there in the deep
dark.
Go through yet again.  Divide cost of ship components, other than
jump-drive, by ten.  That way, a pirate can afford a ship that can catch a
target before the target jumps away

Now, your pirates should work.  If they\'re clever, and the merchants are
not.

This peice of mail can be safely ignored, but is being presented anyway
as a community service for the TML and PBEM.  Also, Dan Corrin may want
to pay careful attention so as to change my CAT mail address.

The Tektronix Logic Analyzers mail system is changing slightly! While
the existing addresses will continue to work fine for the forseeable
future:

	PBEM Administration:	pbem-request@engrg.uwo.ca
	TML Administration:	traveller-request@metolius.wr.tek.com
	TML Submissions:	traveller@metolius.wr.tek.com
	Personal Mail:		jamesp@metolius.wr.tek.com

There is now a new, easy-to-remember mailbox alias for my personal mail,
that you may choose to use or ignore:

	Personal Mail:		James.T.Perkins@tek.com

All mail sent to this new address gets automatically resent to my real
mailbox, jamesp@metolius.wr.tek.com.

Note that the above is case-insensitive, so james.t.perkins@tek.com or
JAMES.T.PERKINS@TEK.COM will work equally well.  The only gotcha is that
in using the new simpler form, additional hosts handle the mail on the
way here and mail takes a few more minutes to reach me; on the other
hand, it\'s conceptually cleaner.

				* * *

Also, outgoing mail from my account here will soon have the "From" line
rewritten as it goes out, so that it appears to come from a host named
"wrgate.wr.tek.com" instead of "metolius.wr.tek.com".  So, don\'t be
surprised if you start receiving mail from jamesp@wrgate.wr.tek.com in a
few weeks.

Once this begins happening, mail sent to jamesp@wrgate.wr.tek.com will
also be re-sent automatically to my regular account,
jamesp@metolius.wr.tek.com.

part of this.  It\'s not all done, but the game-design parts are.
Notably missing are costs and power in and out and several items
such as Ion engines I haven\'t had a chance to evaluate completely
yet.  (Ion and MPD in particular may be a bitch to handle properly
for reasons that would take an article of itself to explain).

  Hybrid  : LOX / Solid Fuel rocket.  * while fuel is actually solid rubber or
             similar material, the fuel for Hybrids should be treated as Liquid
             as it has nearly identical characteristics
  NTR     : Nuclear Thermal Rocket.  Can be designed to run on another fuel
             such as Water.  In this case, the volume of fuel used is the same
             but the thrust increases to x8 base thrust.
 
Reviser\'s Notes:
I\'ve broken liquid fuel engines into three categories:  "normal" liquid
fuel engines, running on some hydrocarbon (usually kerosene or a rough
equivalent) and Liquid Oxygen (LOX), "hypergolic" liquid fuel engines,
running on something like Nitrogen Tetroxide and Hydrazine, and "Liquid
Hydrogen" rockets, runnong on LOX and Liquid Hydrogen.
 
Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.  Normal liquids are reliable
and cheap and low-tech.  Liquid Hydrogen improves performance at the cost
of reliability, something which I\'m striving to write some rules for.
Hypergolics are the most reliable (and cheapest, engine wise), but the
fuels are excessively toxic and hard to handle (remember that Titan silo
that blew up around 1985 ?).
 
I\'ve added Hybrids, where a liquid oxidizer and a solid fuel are burned in
a thrust chamber sort of like a solid rocket engine.  These need more
work, and I\'m doing it, but right now a real-world hybrid engine rocket
design of mine is eating my time and such 8-) so don\'t expect it soon.
 
All of the listed values correspond with known specific impulse, barring
mathematical error while I was calculating them (I spot checked a few and
they\'re right, so they in general are pretty close).

Enjoy. 8-)

All ship positions and communications are calculated from the Alcyon
(unless otherwise noted).
   Al = Alcyon

The following cluster of ships are positioned ~0.9 AU from Alcyon,
7.5 minutes each way for communication signals:
    T = Trakh
    S = Trakh Shuttle
    P = Paladin
    K = Kingfisher
   Ta = Talisman
All of these ships are within a few light-seconds of each other
for purposes of round-trip communication signals.  Note that the
Aurora is *ALMOST* within this group as well.  Communication between
her and the other ships will have a lag of ~45 seconds.

>From the Alcyon, the other ships are positioned as follows:

    W = Westwind, ~1.8 AU from Alcyon, 15 minutes each way for signals.
   Ph = Phin shuttle, ~1.78 AU from Alcyon, 14.8 minutes each way for signals.
    G = Gemini Arbiter ~0.9 AU from Alcyon, 7.5 min. each way for signals.
    B = Bernoulli, ~1.5 AU from Alcyon, 12.5 min. each way for signals.

=======================================================================

 *** Dateline: 334-1119 [1501/Reaver\'s Deep] ***

=== R-Alpha ===

The mimp was dying. 

There could be no question of that, Ayrlathi thought with a sigh.
It lay on a soft bed in his house, its wounds bathed and a few choked
gulps of cool water down its throat, but there was nothing more he
could do....

It never showed signs of regaining consciousness.  It merely lay there,
every shuddering breath possibly its last.  Help me, Ayrlathi prayed
silently.  I ask for little, but the ability to do the impossible.
Help me save this mimp....

He was so engrossed in his thoughts that he almost missed the cries
of fright and wonder from outside.  He turned as the door to his home
swung open, admitting the huge silver mantis that had brought the mimp
to the village, according to one of the local children.  In one claw,
it carried the bags the mimp had been carrying. 

Ayrlathi backed away from the bed, eyes averted in awe. Hearing the
story was one thing, but to SEE the creature--

"You have done well," the Mantis spoke in a shimmering voice, its
command of the Jijid tongue perfect--or was it an echo within
Ayrlathi\'s whirling head?  "This creature\'s own kind are now able
to care for it.  No doubt you have extended its lifespan sufficiently
to reach them in time, through your kindness.  Your care in this time
of need will not be forgotten."

The air around it began to shimmer as it approached the bed.  Ayrlathi
averted his eyes from the brightness.  When he could open them again,
both mimp and Mantis were gone.  Only the bloodstains on the bed gave
testimony to the fact that it hadn\'t been a dream.

"Thank you," Ayrlathi said softly to the empty air.  "Thank you."

=== Kingfisher ===

Jan sits quietly at the battle dressing station aboard the Kingfisher.
Everything is ready in place.  His vacc suit hood is out, ready for quick
donning.  Nothing to do but watch the action evolve on the bridge and listen
to the radio traffic that gets patched through to the BDS.

His beeper, errrr, commdot, fires off.  "Goddammit, I woulda thought that
there wasn\'t any call this far out of the Imperium."  Then it dawns on him,
the only thing he had plugged into his toner was...  "Bishop!".  He hits
the ICS tone for communications.

"Communications, medical.  My commdot just gave me an alert for Bishop\'s
Medical Berth.  Ah, I don\'t know if you\'ve got a line set up to them, but
something weird is happening in the Alcyon\'s sick bay.  It seems the berth
has started a rewarming procedure.  I would suggest that whatever virus
has hit the Aurora has hit the Alcyon, with the medcomp subsystem being
triggered. Our ride home could be in, ah, deep poo-poo.  Could you advise
the Admiral?"

Jan pauses for a bit, "Sorry to dump this on you, but we seem to be missing
an XO for me to run it through, and radio traffic is your turf."

=== Phin Shuttle ===

Ian hops through the portal and, momentarily startled by the
cold humid air and lack of gravity, begins tumbling directly
toward the waiting Phins.

"Oh shit!" comes unbidden from his lips as he silently curses
himself:
   * What a helluva great way to meet the natives.  The contact 
     team\'s gonna skin me alive.  Oh well. *  
and then he begins to laugh out loud as he remembers how clearly
Phins can hear him thinking.

Grabbing the nearest Phin fin, Ian bumps to a stop and mutters
"thanks."

As he pauses to regain his composure, he enjoys a moments reverie.
    * Wow!  I\'d really forgotten how _big_ Ferdie was.  Or he\'s 
      grown a lot in the last twenty-five years.  Must outweigh me 
      by a ton.  It\'s amazing how it takes getting used to the 
      little differences in the dolphins -- Ferdie big and grey, 
      Hooper kind of brown or tan, and Doejin with his (her?) 
      bluish uppers.  And his hair, so soft and yellow and fine...*

    * Brr.  I forgot how cold it seems when the wind chill sets in.  
      Better turn to. *

"Hold on just a second, please.  I gotta get a helmet on before
I freeze and suffocate."  

With his free hand, Ian fishes his folded helmet out of his coveralls 
and slides it over his head. Then, releasing his other hand, he 
fastens it into place.  While slowly beginning to drift, he sets his 
suit temperature, and visually takes inventory.

    * hmm.. lessee, life support - no oxy backup, suit screens only, 
      power for 6.4 hours; suit intact, temperature control func-
      tioning; snub pistol w/tranq, blade -- nice blade, glad I 
      remembered to stop by the armory on the way to the Tal\' --; 
      sensors, passive suit monitors only; comms, suit radio working 
      (I hope). *

Setting the suit radio\'s frequency to general broadcast, and chinning
the transmit button, Ian speaks:

"Expedition, Thomas:
I\'m on the Phin shuttle, with two native cetaceans.  I am in good
health and my suit is working.  The natives appear to be of the 
_tursiops_ family and all seem to be friendly.  I have no cameras,
vids, or sensors with me, so here\'s a quick verbal description:
Temperature here is about 18 Celsius, humidity about 120 percent.
No artificial gravity being used.  Hard to see through the mist, but
as I move around I\'ll keep you posted.  I\'m going to try to communicate
with the Phins.  Awaiting requests and intructions."

(No one hears him, of course.  In his excitement, he forgot that his
radio couldn\'t possibly get through the skin of the Shuttle or reach
to the Talisman.)

Then, grabbing Ferdie by the dorsal fin, 
    * Okay.  I\'m set for about six hours.  How \'bout a tour and
      introductions?  All this thinkin\' at you is tiring.  Any 
      questions I can answer before I wear out? *

To this, Ferdy replies,
    * You want a tour of the shuttle?  All right, keep hold of
      my fin, then.  Doejin, you don\'t need me for a while, do
      you? *

After Ian\'s introduction (and learning about "shaking hands"), Doejin
says,
    * Excuse me for a moment, Ian, I need to finish the rendevous
      with the Westwind. *

He glides over to the pilot console and takes his place adjusting various
controls and ensuring proper ship alignment.

    * Ferdy, feel free to show Ian around.  Just keep his flukes
      high and tight so we don\'t have an accident.  We should reach
      rendevous shortly and it looks like the otehr ships are getting
      in position for landing on The Hoop. *
 
With a mental flick, Ferdy\'s skysuit begins to propel him slowly
and silently through the craft, with Ian trailing along.

=== Aurora ===

Dee-Dee-Dee-Dee-Dee!  Will you look at her!  Dee!  She\'s like a
sunburst of bronze!  There have never been such beautiful wings as
hers!

He rolled over and stooped in on her.  Accelerating to where the wind
sang a sweet exciting song.

She saw him and went into a slow roll.  For a breathtaking second she
flew inverted looking up at him.  The way the light caught her eyes
could make you stall!

He closed the gap in seconds and threw his wings out wide and oblique.
A few meters above and behind her, his legs and tail flew on beneath
him and for a split second he was flying at right angles to his
direction of travel.  The speed bled off rapidly in the natural
braking maneuver as he matched her course above her.

He tilted his wings down and got in even closer, synchronizing his
wing beats so he could get in closer without hitting her wings.  He
reached out a taloned hand and caressed her back as she flew beneath
him.

Suddenly, she dove down away from him a few meters and rolled.  She
flew inverted with her talons reaching out to him.  Tweel watched for
a second that seemed an eternity before he dropped down and took her
talons in his.

She took a last powerful stroke and folded her wings.

Tweel followed her motions and they both began to plummet.  The wind
screamed as they fell headlong.  The glittering sea of the Jayelyan
desert rushed at them like a living thing.

He sang over the tornado...

Would you like to come up higherrr
wherre we two can fly around?
I can\'t believe you\'rre happy
bein\' sstuck herre on the ground!
If you like I\'lll take you with me
wherre the air iss sso much lighterr,
And all you have to do iss hold me tighterrr.
	Tighterr!
		Tighterr!
			Tighterrr!
    ........	....	...	..	.

    Confusion... Target alarms screaming... Enclosure... Explosions...
Tweel read off the bearings to the Skipper...  Targets bearing zero
niner two, mark three two five...  Range five five thousand kilometers
Target identified... Four Zhodani Va class fighters... Second group
bearing three two three mark zero niner five, Range six seven thousand
Kilometers...  Targets identified... Two Zhdits class escorts.  All
targets closing....
    Va class fighters closing at relative acceleration of 4.7 G\'s...
    Zhdits escorts are closing at 5.3G\'s relative...
    Tweel studied the nightmare sensor array...  How did Chronor scramble
everything so fast?...
    Suddenly the bridge shuddered, A hit...
    "Bridge - Engineering:  our jump drive\'s in shreds!"
    A huge explosion smashed through the bridge...  A HOLE in the plating
appeared right above Tweel\'s station...

    ........	....	....	...	..	.

    *Jump grid capacitors discharged...  Looks like fair winds...
Our last jump and we can get out of this human closet!* complained
Macin.  *Jayelya needs more naval architects!  If my theory is right, I\'m
going to insist that the planetary development fund endow a chair for a
professor of naval archtecture to an Ael who can build ships for us...*
    Tweel laughed, *Ssseya!  That\'d be a nice wind.  I\'ve spent too much
time in these human built ships.  Even with the holoprojections, the lack of
wing room still blows me ill.*
    *But still, Macin, how can you be sure that star\'s got what you
say it has?  If it doesn\'t we\'re gonna have a storm trying to refuel and
fly home.*
    Macin folded his wings uncomfortably at the thought *Karr... I\'d
better go check the engines, if I\'m wrong, we got a long way to flap home!*
    *Ssseya!  You got that right!  I\'ll come aft in a minute and lend
you a talon.*
    Tweel absorbed himself in the navigation plot.  *All looking good...
We got fair winds to ride until..*

The universe turned GREY.  Dimly, a sharp report sounded kilometers away in
the universe of GREY...

Time passed...

Or did it?

Was it time or the illusion of time?  Hmmm... must think about that...
If I could think...  Where am I?  All GREY...  Am I part of the GREY?
Have I substance or only thought?  Questions...  No Answers...

UHHH!
PAIN!  PAIN!  PAIN!
Somebody stop the PAIN!
My stomach!  My head!  My mind!
Squeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!!!!
Somebody stop the PAIN!

Great Hunter!  Kill me and stop the PAIN!

	........	.....	...	..	.

    "SSSSSCHAYAAYAYAYAYAYAYA!"  Tweel screamed as he awoke.  The
instincts that tried to lift him into the air merely bashed his wings
into the ceiling a before he realized where he was...  The bridge of
the Aurora.

    The bridge of the Aurora is quiet and peacefully subdued, as the
scout ship glides through space enroute to its assigned rendesvouz.
Holo-monitors glow softly, slowly changing, as the ship\'s status is
updated. Jump drive on inactive standby, main fusion power plant
cheerily pumping out megawatts of power, thruster plates firmly
nudging the scout along. The holotank shifts, focusing more on the
ringworld as the ships begin to converge.

    Dr. Van der Merwe simply stared at him.

    "Macin is... dead...?  Chrrristian?"

    Christian is sitting, almost lying in the pilot\'s couch, which he has
pushed back from the control panels and monitors so that he can stretch
his lengthy frame fully and comfortably put his feet up. His pose is
very relaxed, his movements casual and languid, as if he is enjoying
the moment, lest the future be less kind.

    Currently, he has pulled a flexible-mount holomonitor out towards his
couch, and appears to be involved in a new game of dhage (apparently
having finished his game analysis) against Moira, while pausing at
irregular intervals to refresh himself from a soothing warm beverage.
The strains of a Vilani jazz group gently displace the discordant
noises of normal shipboard operation.

    Tweel shook himself with a loud flap to clear his head, "Krrrrr...
Har! what a night..."  Very slowly, and with great care Tweel folded
his wings and glanced at the sensor panel in front of him.  A quick
check to see if anything new had shown up while he \'slept\'

    "By the way...  Wherre\'ss that crrrazy Varrgrrr got too...?"

    "Chrrristian, wherrrre\'s \'Vouf?"

=== Talisman ===

    Onboard the Talisman, after handing the conn over to Iasic, Andon
tries to sit back, relax and look as nonchalant as possible.  However,
as the minutes tick by Andon\'s fidgeting and nervous finger tappings
suggest that he is anything but calm.

    "Uh, Iasic, I got the conn again. Just keep feeding the data and I\'ll
take care of flying, OK?"  Andon again starts taking a more active role
in the piloting.

    As Andon again feels he has regained some control all signs of his
previous apprehension disappear.

=== Kingfisher ===

     Ger digests all of the new happenings coolly, as he listens to
the broadcast from the Hoop....
 
> "Iasic has been mildly chastised and will not improve your systems
> beyond this without your permission."
> 
    "To the sophont at 1337.45 Mhz, Please Identify yourself.  If you
have any control over the Iasic personality, please instruct it to
disengage itself from all our systems. I consider its actions to be
quite disruptive, and irregular." "We have the coordinates, I am quite
confident that my personnel can get us there without any difficulty or
assistance".

    Ger turns to Witfield.  "Cut the transmission on the 1337.45 MHz
frequency, but listen in for a while and see if there is any reply" He
then sits back in his chair (up until now he had been leaning forward
with an intense look on his face). His features take on a pensive look
for a few minutes while the kingfisher pursues its current course.

    Etienne seems engrossed in just watching the play of nav data coming
across his display from no aparrent source.  After a few seconds he snaps
out of it and opens the intercom.

    "Monsieur Schmud, you may stand down, but please don\'t lock the weapons 
systems.  I can handle the turret from here should an emergency arise.
Although, events seem to be proceeding VERY smoothly just now."  

    At the gunnery station, Abdul replies, "Acknowledged!  Standing
down immediately."  Then, to himself, he mutters, "I wish people would
make up their minds as to my job around here.  At least I get to move
to somewhere less cramped and less of a target."

With this Abdul secures the turret for remote operation and he heads
back to the main body of the shuttle.  "At least the emergency seems
to be over for a while," he mutters as he leaves.

    "Lazer, there\'s..."  Etienne stops when he realizes that Lazer
can\'t hear him in the disconnected fighter, and opens a comm channel.
"Lazer there doesn\'t seem to be much reason for you to remain in the
fighter, unless Commander Ger says otherwise.  Have you been hearing
everything from our new friends?"

=== Aurora/Gemini Arbiter/Paladin/Talisman ===

    On the bridges of the _Aurora_, _Paladin_, _Talisman_, and _Gemini
Arbiter_, after a period of silence, the monitors once again crackle to life.
A new logo appearing in the center, seemingly designed by an advertising
agency or graphic design studio.  The logo forms the word "IasicNet" in the
center, with the letters smartly integrated into each other.  A stylized
representation of R-Alpha is evident in the background.  Colors pulsate in
random patterns along the whole image.

    _Attention Visitors_ began the calm, familiar voice, _All instructions
from R-Alpha have now been executed.  Please relax and enjoy the landing
procedures.  Planetfall will be initiated shortly._

    Then, after a brief pause, the logo dissolves.  A rendering of R-Alpha
then appears on the screen, accompanied by a snappy little song in the
background.

    _Now, in response to many of your inquiries, which I was unable to
answer at the time they were posed, I shall make a brief presentation
regarding myself and my homeworld, R-Alpha._

    The image of R-Alpha shrinks away and is replaced by a schematic
drawing of a semiconductor chip.

    _As you already know, my unique identity is IASC-256/32.
Realizing that this would be a bit cumbersome to your speech
conventions, I formed the nearest logical I could to your language:
Iasic._

    At which point, the letters Iasic are translucently overlaid on the
schematic while "IASC-256/32" appear at the top.

    _I was designed originally to act as a quality control and
maintenance unit for R-Alpha\'s numerous systems.  I am psionically
aware, and relatively strong in capabilities, compared to average
ability among the Visitors, though most of the denizens of the
ringworld are on a similar level as myself.  I can analyze and
\'rewire\' any mechanical or electronic entity through a complex process
of sub-atomic manipulation.  Reprogramming is a primary task of mine,
and I can handle many billions of calculations every second, although
the actual number is dependent upon the capabilities of the system to
which I happen to be integrated._

    Then, the schematic drawing disappears, along with all labels and
titles.  A graphic of R-Alpha reappears, though without any specific
documentation.

    _This, as you have already surmised, is R-Alpha.  Unfortunately,
there is such a wealth of information specific to the entity that I
cannot fulfill the query for information as requested.  I would have
compiled an index for you, in your rather cumbersome language, but in
order for it to be of any value, its size would have been
prohibitively large.  Indeed, simply to download it to the IasicNet
would require more available memory and storage than is currently
available.  It\'s total size would approach 6,620 terabytes of
information.  I would suggest that any specific requests for
information should be directed toward the entity itself, as it could
more effectively unravel exactly which information is desired and
which is extraneous._

    Then, after that screen dissolves, a return to the "IasicNet" logo
dominates the screen, although the music still continues.

    _And now, a word about this presentation.  I utilized all the
information provided by Tweel regarding human and vargyr emotional
processes.  After an in-depth analysis of the information, and the
construction of some logic models, I created the name, logo, and
presentation for maximum effect and comfort to you, the audience.
Thank you._

    At which point, the words "Thank you" overlay on the screen in a
beautiful, flowing script.  The music ends with perfect tonality.

=== Alcyon ===

Nine minutes and eigtheen seconds ago....
 "Morgan, this is \'Vouf. Have Dr. Werner check on Adrian Bishop, OK? Out."

Nine minutes and eighteen seconds later, the tight-beam transmission hits
the Alcyons four millimeter high-gain antenna.  In a heartbeat, Morgan Grey
is listening to the request on the bridge speakers.  Sliding over to the
commo panel, he orders a reply.  A hull-mounted maser horn slews around and
locks onto the transponder signal from Aurora.

"Aurora, Aurora, this is Alcyon.  Roger your last.  Wilco.  Out."  Putting
commo back on stand-by, Grey swings around in his seat and looks at Dr.
Manfred Werner, who is dutifully absorbed in his sensor controls.

"Hey, Doc.  You wanna take a hop down to Sickbay and check on Bishop?"
Grey smirks, "\'Vouf wants to know if he\'s rolled over or something."
Satisfied that he\'s carried out his latest order, Grey turns back to
the helm console.

Dr. Werner slowly looks up from his sensor readings, showing the painfully
slow ballet of starships across the R-Alpha system.  He glared at the back
of Morgan\'s head, then slides back the contour seat and heads for Sickbay.

Once off the bridge, he slowly moves aft, down the Axis-0 corridor, past
Cmdr. Ger\'s cabin, past the computer and communications service bays,
towards the ship\'s mess, and the grav-lift down to deck 1B.  As he walks,
he mutters, "Dammit, Grey.  I am a PHYSICIST, not a medical doctor!",
little realizing that his oath would leave a small, but rabid group of
video entertainment fans from Terra\'s distant past rolling on the floor
in laughter.

Once down the grav-lift, he picks up his pace the last half dozen meters
to the Sickbay door, eager to return to the bridge.  Palming the door lock,
he briefly curses Dr. Van Der Merwe for sealing the compartment from casual
snoopers.  His commdot in place, Werner calls the bridge.

"Mr. Grey, this is Dr. Werner.  I am thinking that it would perhaps
be easier for me to determine the current state of Mr. Bishop\'s corpse
if the door to Sickbay were not locked, do you not agree?"  A brief,
somewhat uncultured reply from the bridge is immediately followed by
the hiss of the sickbay door sliding open.

Werner crosses sickbay without hesitation and opens the hatch to the
low berth compartment.  He is immediately rewarded by a small, insistant
tone, eminating from one of the nearby hibernation pods.  Slowly, as he
approaches Low Berth number 4, his eyes lock on the data display and the
flashing lights.

	"Stage one complete
	 Stage two complete
	 Stage three revival in progress - HALTED
	 Revival prep. team required IMMEDIATELY"

Dr. Werner selects "OCCUPANT BIOLOGICAL STATUS" and his eyes widen
in amazement as the diagnostics scroll by.  So great is his surprise
that he lapses into his (seldom used in the presence of the crew)
native tongue.  "Zum Teufel!!  Vas ist das?  Das ist unglaublich!
DAS IST UNMOGLICH!!"

=== Paladin ===

    Goughzar looks about the Paladin bridge, and watches in amazement at
the happenings. Growling under his breath he leaves Charyn in Dr. Morser\'s
hands and links to Dr. Limner\'s room with the active intercom.  "Dr Limner?
How are you doing? Do you require anything?".

    Assuming Dr. Limner is in relatively good shape, he turns back to the
bridge terminals and begins talking to Iasic.

    "Well Iasic, I realize you can\'t give us everything, though we may
want it, but I was wondering if you might detail some physical
information - general features and traits - of the inhabitants we will
likely encounter first in our landing zone. If you can, I would also
like a detailed scan and map transferred to the local storage that I
might review the area where we will be landing".

    With this done, he waits for any information to be transfered,
monitors the ship\'s descent, and begins to get an overview of what
Iasic thinks he might expect upon landing.

=== Talisman ===

    Meanwhile a very concerned Kimball Redd is kneeling of Ralf\'s inert
body in the corridor to the airlock.

    "The lights are on, but it looks like Ralf\'s not home.  I\'ll bring him up
to sick-bay."

    He struggles to lift Ralf\'s suited body, he grumbles, "Ah, what am I, a
weight-lifter or an Engineer ? - Computer, cut the corridor floor-plates to
half gravity."  As Ralf\'s apparent weight decreases, he comments, "That\'s
better."

=== Aurora ===

    At Tweel\'s awakening, Christian swivels his head to look at him.
"Ah, you\'re awake now, Hunter-Above." He turns back to his dhage holo,
pondering his next move. "Oh, that\'s right, \'Vouf. Guess you missed
it." He glances at Tweel. "He had to step out for a few minutes,
something about going over to the Gemini Arbiter, I think. He should
be back before long." Christian continues his game, pausing only to
stretch briefly and take another sip of tea.

    Tweel twists his head upside down to look at Christian in surprise,
"We docked alrrready?  Jussst how long wasss I out?"

    Tweel stretches his wings, an action which takes nearly all of the
available bridge space.  He taps the intercom with a sharp talon claw, "Kar!
Hunter-Chaser...  Need any hellp?"

    Quizzically, Christian turns his head to follow Tweel. "Docked? You mean
with the Arbiter? No, we haven\'t docked with them. Try the inter-ship comm
if you want to talk to \'Vouf."

=== Kingfisher ===

    Ger activates the intercome.  "Jan, Did you want to send any
communication to your patient? I assume that you are the one that the
creature on the radio was talking about."

    "Yes sir," comes the reply, "I just advised communications that my
pager has gone off, indicating that Bishop is going through the
revitalizing process.  My limited paging system tells me he is doing
well so far. However, to find out more I wouldn\'t mind having a
channel available to communicate with the medcomp aboard the Alcyon.

    "My concern, beyond Bishop, is that the medcomp may have been hit
by the virus and linking up to it may jeopardize the Fingkisher, but
that\'s something the commo people will need to assess.

    "Sir, with a secure line I would be able to give you a status
report on Bishop, and possibly on the state of the Alcyon."

    Ger considers this for a moment.  "Yes, certainly, as soon as we
can get I\'ll have someone get you a spare channel, after all there are
ten radio-type things on board, but you may have to wait for some
assembly"

    Yorblin responds, "Sir, it shouldn\'t take too long.  I\'ll just
ask.  thank you."

=== Aurora ===

Tweel turns his attention to the Iasic terminal.  He flips his head
upsidedown in surprise and disgust. "Grreat Hunterrr, he\'sss playing
Muzak at uss!  We may have to trry thosse anti-virrus prrogramss
again!"

"Thank you Iasssic, you sssay that the inforrrmation we have
rrrequessted would clearrrly overrrload our currrent data banksss.
Howeverrr, if you could brriefly fly overrr a few questionsss, I think
that we can all look down on thisss frrrom a grreaterrr altitude."

"Quessstion one: It is apparrant that the Rrring iss inhabitted by
many intellligent sspeciess of ssophontss.  Who iss rrresponsible forr
the constrrruction of the Rrring?  Wasss it an intersspecial efforrt?
If ssso which sspeciess werrre involved?"

"Quesstion two: By ex-examination of our data banksss, I assume you
may underrrstand the sscale of te-techlnological levelsss.  What
te-tech level (in ourr unitss) wasss utilizzzed in the consstruction
of the Rrring, and what isss the te-tech level used in itss
maintainance?  And what te-tech level werrre you consstrructed?"

"Quesstion three:  How lllong ago wass the Rring built?"

"Quesstion fourrr: We arrre going to meet with some dellligation of
sssome sssort.  Thiss impliesss therrre is ssome sssorrt of goverrning
body in the Rrring."
	Tweel sighs heavily at the thought of an advanced government.
Surely a truely advanced group of sophonts should have evolved to the
point where they can handle anarchy.  We may be tech 4-5 but..  How I
miss home!
	"Arre thesse rrreprresentatives of the Rrring asss a whole or
sssome sssubsset of it?"

"Quessstion five: In my own planetss hisstorrry, ourrr firrst contact
with humanss prroved dissasterouss.  Frrrankly, I would advisse you to
be \'Sssusspiciousss\' of humanss.  Is therrre any inforrmation you
rrrequirre to assisst you in yourrr invesstigation of usss?"

Quessstion tten: Iss therrre any inforrmation you feel we should have
when flying into sssuch a meeting?"

Tweel spreads his three fingered talons, and turns to Christian,
"Therre we go.. Ten ssimple questionsss....  I wonderrr iff we\'ll get
any ussseful answerrrs..."

=== Kingfisher ===

    Etienne once again stares at the display, but shortly the fingers of one
hand start tapping faster and faster on the arm of his acceleration couch.
He suddenly sits up and addresses empty air.  "Monsieur Iasic, while you
probably know of me from the files onboard the Alcyon, please allow me t 
introduce myself.  I am Etienne de Mer, helmsman of the Kingfisher an 
Transport team leader.  If I may ask a favor, would you please contact Dr.
Karl Morser and ask him about Leadfoot?  It may have slipped his mind in all
the confusion but your aid in a certain investigation could be very useful."

The screen then fades back to the familiar logo, but this time with no
background music.

_Hello, Mr. de Mer, it is a pleasure to finally meet you in person.  I have
directly patched your com unit to the room which Dr. Morser currently
occupies.  I hope that this will facilitate your job, and if there is any
other way in which I could be of assistance, please do not hesitate to ask._

=== Aurora/Gemini Arbiter/Paladin/Talisman ===

Several minutes pass.  Once again, the "IasicNet" symbol bursts on
screen, with a bluster of musical fanfare.

_I have accessed MasterSPU and constructed the following answers to
Tweel\'s inquiries.  I sincerely hope that these are general enough to
meet the parameters defined in the request.  I cannot say that I fully
understand what Tweel meant to say when he requested that I "briefly
fly over a few questions", but I have done my best to extrapolate a
rough meaning._

Iasic then replays a recording of Tweel\'s question, and answers each
in turn.

  _The Great Race constructed the ring.  I do not know of a name for
them in your language.  However, this is an illustration of a
representative member of the Great Race._

Iasic then displays an image on one of the Aurora\'s holo-panels of
what appears to be a very large Droyne, with a larger-than-normal
brain case.  The "IasicNet" logo shrinks to occupy only the extreme
right side of the screen.

=== Kingfisher ===

Witfield, busy performing his duty on the bridge, has part of his attention
focused on IASIC\'s presentation to Tweel (as the broadcast does not appear
to be tight-beam).  When Isaac announces the ring world was built by the
great race, and shows the picture of a large Dryone, Witfield exclaims,
"I knew it, I knew it had to be them!"

=== Aurora ===

    Dr. Tweel bobs excitedly on his perch, singing to himself, *Key-Har!
Further evidence the Droyne were the connected with the ancients!*

  _Based on the scale you use, I can accurately extrapolate technological
advancement to Tech Level 17.  The construction of the Ring, its maintenance,
and my own construction are significantly more advanced than Tech Level 17._

    Tweel looks over to Christian.  "Krrr! They can teach uss a thing orrr
six..."

_The ring has been fully operational for 10,635,554,759,707 of your seconds._

    Tweel whistles a quick series of notes to Triple Three.

    The robot quickly replies "337,251.22906 standard years."

    Tweel\'s head flips upside down.  *Correct time period...  an ancient
site... a fully intact and operational ancient site...*

    *Great Hunter, Macin, you were RIGHT!*

_I am not aware of any formal delegation preparing to meet you at the
landing site designated by the R-Alpha Master SPU.  If representatives
of any of the races which inhabit the Ring are nearby, you may
interact with them at your leisure._

_Having had the concept of suspicion presented to me by Bhyarrvouf, I
have determined that none of the Visitors pose a direct threat to
either the Ring or to myself.  Therefore, I have no need of suspicion.
As I have already explained, I find it to be an inefficient concept.
Although in the context of a savage and barbarous culture, I do now
understand its value._

A large question mark then appears on the screen.

_There was a discrepancy in the number order of questions presented to
my by Tweel.  Numbers six through nine were not received, and
therefore have not been answered.  I suggest that the question
presented by Tweel as number ten should be renumbered to the more
logical label of "question six" for ease of future reference.

    Tweel clucks under his breath, then sings in his native tongue,
*Sorry, I tend to fly best in base six.*

_Only the suggestion that you do not interact with the resident races
of the Ring in a hostile manner.  MasterSPU would almost certainly
take steps to prevent such an eventuality from occurring._

    Tweel then switches back to his stilted galanglic.  "Sssince
therre iss no forrrmal deligation..."  Tweel visibly relaxes at the
thought of not having to fly against such a beast, "With whom arrre we
to meet?  If no one, Why you dirrrecting uss to thiss parrrticularrr
site?"

    Tweel then sings, *There may be hope for anarchy yet...*

    "Alssso. llet me rrreiterrate one quesstion: Are therre any
quessstionss you have about usss that you have?"

    Tweel add\'s an afterthought to his latest barrage of questions:

    "Iasssic, since therrre arrre sso many ssspeciess on the Rrring, a
I am flying overrr unfamiliarr terrain.  Arrre you awarre of any Ael
Yael inhabitantsss?  It seems that with ssuch a diverrsity as you
indicate it could be posssible that therrre may be some of my own
k-k-kind therre."

    "Oh, I alssso suppose that the Humanss and Assslan woulld be
interrresssted if sssome of theirrr numberrr werrre therre ass
well..."

    Tweel streches his wings to touch the opposite bulk heads of the
Aurora\'s bridge and refolds them.  He glances up at the ceiling as he
waits for a reply.

    Suddenly, a further thought occurs. "On a differrrent courrrse, I
would sssuggesst that you eliminate the muzak from the prresentation
forrmat...  If you doubt me I ssuggesst you consssult the lllibrary
data file: rec.music.synth.muzak.death.death.death.  It showsss that
sssome ssspeciesss sssufferrr adverrsse effects when ex-ex-expossed to
it.  Sssome morrre than otherrrs...."

    "The Asslan might open firrre on you..."

=== Talisman ===

    Redd carrys Ralf\'s body into the lounge, staggering a little under the
higher gravity.  Dave Sokuku is still staring at the empty space that Ian
stepped into when he disappeared through the ring\'s teleportal.

    "Give me a hand with him will you..." grunts Redd, as he struggles
with Ralf\'s fully restored weight.  As they lay Ralf on one of the bench
seats, Redd asks, "What was that from Ian about going over to the shuttle?
"I didn\'t think they were that close yet?"

=== Kingfisher ===

    Ger asks Jett, "Richard, have you got the legalites all wrapped
up? Are all the ships (except the local, and alsan of course), under
our command?"

    Richard looks up from his close watch of the holotank. "No,
Admiral.  I conferred with Subcommander Bhyarrvouf some time ago and
sent him the standard Turnskaad contract and insurance forms for
Doctor Trrrweeerrrlll to sign; I can only assume he has done so. As to
the inhabitants of the Gemini Arbiter and the Westwind, to my
knowledge the Subcommander has not "read them in" as the old saying
goes, so they are still independent vessels, though they do seem to be
receptive to our orders. We will have to trust that the Subcommander
will address those matters...."

=== Gemini Arbiter ===

    Aurelia and Nicole\'s conversation is interrupted by a polite "Ahem."

    Nicole taps Aurelia on the shoulder to get her attention.  Aurelia,
busy watching the console, shakes it off but Nikky is too insistent.  Ergo,
she turns around.  At this point they are momentarily stunned.

    Standing behind them in a crouch, a massive Gauss pistol in each hand, is
a Vargr with stunning black and white fur, piercing blue eyes and a black
and grey uniform of an unrecognizable type. A blood-red data monocular
is dropped over one eye, and a thin, barely visible beam of laser light
from the muzzle of each gun is touching each woman\'s forehead.

    "Am I addressing," the Vargr says politely, "The sisters Xerxes?"

    On hearing these words they are snapped out of their stupor and emit
loud, high-pitched, and BLOOD-CURDLING screams!!  Then, several actions
happen simultaneously.

    Nikky yells some gibberish, apparently at the Gemini Arbiter\'s now-
inoperative computer system, and twists to one side.  Aurelia hits a couple
of buttons and twists to the other side. The precision with which these
actions occured would make one wonder how much is actually panic, but given
the excitement, there isn\'t much time for analysis.

    \'Vouf, on hearing this loud, piercing noise winces and steps back but 
refrains from firing.  With an expression of disgust, he jams both guns 
back into their holsters, missing the holsters entirely and dropping the 
guns on the floor when he lets go, and folds his arms, waiting for the 
shrieking to stop with a half-annoyed, half-pleading look in his eyes.

    Iasic, having devoured the Arbiter\'s anti-hijack software as his first
official act aboard the ship, is busy integrating into the systems and
rummaging through the wealth of stored information, thus ignoring everyone.

    Picking themselves up off the floor and noticing that none of their
security measures took effect, the two women look at each other and then
at \'Vouf.  In unison they go through the variuos motions of rearranging
their jumpsuits.  Nikky noticies the gauss pistols on the floor and bends
down to retrive them while Aurelia speaks.
 
    "Ah! MMMmmm... Yes, we\'re are the Xerxes sisters. I\'m Aurelia and this
is my sister Nicole. And who might you be?"

    Meanwhile, Nicole gingerly hands the pistols to \'Vouf, butt first.
"Ah... I think you dropped these. ...Um... Didn\'t you ever hear about 
announcing yourself! You. . ."

    Bhyarrvouf accepts the guns back from Nikki, holstering them. With
a gentle snatch, he catches the back of her hand in a metal glove and
kisses it.

    Aurelia, interrupts before any more is said and smiles at \'Vouf.  "Now
don\'t get nasty. But you do have a point."  Turning to \'Vouf, she continues,
"How about we try this meeting again in a couple of hours under more 
congenial circumstances.  We\'re not at our best right now.  We must look
horrible. We need to bathe, change clothes, do our hair, our makeup..."

    Nicole pipes in, "Oh you\'re right! We\'re a mess. We need to..."  Then,
shifting to a more diplomatic tone, she continues, "Yes that would be nice
if you would come back later. We would most appreciate it. Our first
introduction should be conducted under a better atmosphere than this one.
How about we try this again in a couple of hours like Aurelia suggested?
And if you would be so kind as to radio ahead we would be most grateful."

    Both women move toward \'Vouf as if to usher him out but stop in
confusion.

    Deeply puzzled, Aurelia asks, "By the way, how did you get here anyway?"

=== Kingfisher ===

    In the passenger compartment of the Kingfisher, Dr. Yorblin
organizes his thoughts concerning his patient, several light-minutes
away.

    "Communications, medical-the CO has cleared me for a line to the
Alcyon, could you make the connection and route to the holo display in
the BDS."

{twiddle thumbs while waiting for Mac or Zben to free up a line,
hopefully they\'re able to do this while isolating to that particular
circuit}

    Jan immerses himself into the holo image.  Quickly darting to the
medcomp subroutine, he locates Bishop\'s icon.  Delving through the
initial physical findings, he notes that the patient has stable vital
signs, and physically, his body is in as good a shape as it had been
left hours ago. Chemically, there are a few oddities.  It appears that
whatever started the revitalizing procedure has done well so far.  He
is off most of the machinery, but still appears to be comatose...

    Jan than punches up what few tests he can order while Bishop
remains un-attended - a neurotransmitter byproducts scan and an EEG.
The neuro-T scan shows a heavy predominance of GABAergic byproducts,
as well as break- down products of norepi, including VMA.  "Hmmmm,
this would indicate heavy dream state sometime in the last two hours,
as if Bishop could have a dream!  And look at the increased
benzodiazepine analogs...if he\'s there, he\'s very rested."  Turning to
the EEG, there is marked increase in beta waves and sleep spindles
with an underlying pattern of slow delta waves.  This is in distinct
contrast to the previous abnormal pattern of rare delta waves.  It
means his brain is there and functioning...REM artifact, he\'s
dreaming, they require functional synapses, stress waves require
functional neurons, what the hell is going on?

    Get a trace of what happened in the computer over the last few
hours.  Hmmm, yep stuff has been messed with here, better get a
software guy to look at this...Warming and flushing started...
nanocytes reprogrammed...  don\'t know what this stuff means...
looks like an attempt to reconstruct.  This whatever knows a hell
of a lot more than I do about the brain, but seems to have had
problems with all of Bishop\'s implants...a lot of seeks to that
section of his medical database.

    I don\'t know what the hell is going on over there.  Seems Bishop\'s
been put back together by something on the Hoop, pretty beneficient
for a virus.  Well, he\'s still having frequent REM, maybe it\'s best we
keep it that way until one the med types gets back to the Alcyon.

ENTRY: MEDLOG: BISHOP, Adrian
Physician\'s Orders:  reinstate sleep set therapy through EEG \'trodes
in place.  Maintain sleep stage IV with REM cycles q 15 minutes.
Provide parenteral nutrition through existing routes, match I/O.
Notes:
- - Patient appears to have received extensive neural reconstruction,
  this has been evidenced by an increase in both neurotransmitter
  breakdown products and increased EEG activity.  Functionality of
  the reconstruct has not been tested, and will be deferred until medical
  personnel can return to the Alcyon.  Until that time patient will
  remain on sleep set.
- - Problem list: neuroreconstruct artifact, psych disorder (multiaxis
  probable), consider functional recall and process difficulties.

    Jan disengages from the holo and hits the intercom.

    "CO, medical.  Sir, best as I can tell, Bishop has had a brain
reconstruct.  I can\'t tell you how well that has come off or what sort
of functionality he will return with.  As a temporazing measure, I
have continued him on his sleep set.  This will keep him going for a
couple of days without difficulty, however, a physician will need to
return to the Alcyon to complete the process and to evaluate Bishop.

    "My other concern is that the medcomp was extensively
reconfigured, it felt \'faster\', none of the functions I looked for
were deleted, but the process seemed more streamlined.  I am wondering
what access the Hoop has had to our data, not just the medical stuff,
but everything.  I really can\'t say more than that...I\'m not a
computer expert."

=== Paladin ===

Iasic breaks onto the intercom nearest to Dr. Morser.

_Excuse me, Dr. Morser, but a Mr. Etienne de Mer has requested some
information from you regarding the current status of a "Leadfoot".  You are
now directly patched in with him and may converse freely._

=== R-Alpha ===

The metal shell was half buried in the sandy dirt, its side torn open.
The Mantis\'s claws widened the opening swiftly and surely, the metal
rending under its grasp like paper. It poked its head inside and looked
around. 

Blood and crushed protoplasm littered the walls, ceiling and floor. There
were six couches in three rows of two: the first two were torn asunder,
their occupants the logical source of the matter now adorning the inside
of the shell. The next two were also empty, with the restraints having
been undone from one of them. Blood on that seatback matched the spectrum
of the creature found in the desert. The last two seats were still 
occupied, by two members of a species similar if not identical to the
one that had escaped the shell somehow. Both were alive but in need of
aid.

The Mantis cut them out of their seats with care, leaving the carrybags
dangling from where they were tied to each creature\'s leg to avoid loss.
It lifted them out of the shell, and laid them gently on the sand beside
the first creature, whose wounds had begun to bleed again.

*I am ready,* it broadcast. *They are ready.*

*Excellent,* came the reply. *Let their own kind care for them, for they
should know best how to do so. I sense a receptive mind and an impatience
to be of service to the injured-- HERE!*

A Gate flashed open, enveloping the three bodies, and faded. The Mantis
noted their departure impassively, then turned to the task of cutting
up the abandoned shell for safe disposal....

=== Aurora ===

    The Aurora\'s hallways ring with a loud THUMP, as of several bodies
falling to the floor. It seems to have come from the Cargo Hold....

    While looking at the engineering status monitor, Christian\'s eyes swivel
aft and downward to gaze in the general direction of the cargo compartment.
"What in the...." Slightly mystified, he calls up the security systems
and hooks into the cargo bay sensors.

    Tweel raised his head and cranes his neck around oddly.

    "Chrrristian...?  Did you THUMP?"

    Christian is so intent on his interrogation of the security
computer that he is seemingly oblivious to Tweel\'s inquiry.
Christian\'s electronic importunings are finally rewarded with a brief
flurry of data and a vid picture. Christian\'s mystified look
transforms into one of urgent concern.  He has time for a fervent
whisper. "My God...."

    Triple three glided forward, "Urgent!  Sensors now recording NAS
signatures of three additional life forms aboard ship.  Current
location: Aurora cargo hold."

    In one fluid motion, Christian slaps the restraint release with
one hand while he grasps the console with the other, assisting him as
he rolls out of the couch on to the deck, facing aft.

    Tweel made a grab for his grav belt helmet.  "Densssiometer
ssscan!  Arrre they arrrmed?  Wherrre arre they moving?"

    Triple three paused as he rechecked the data.  "Targets are not moving.
Sensors report a variety of equipment, impossible to determine armament."

    "Ssspeciess deterrrmination!?" he called as he fitted it onto his
head.

    Triple three again paused.  "Unable to identify with complete
accuracy.  Estimate 81% chance that one is human.  Estimate 32% chance
that the others are also human.  There is a 11% chance that they are
vargr, and a 0.009% chance that they are Newts."

    Tweel fiddled with the straps, "Can you account for the
discrrrepancy?"

    Triple three checked his readings, "It is possible that the
creatures in question are damaged."

    Tweel wheeled around and sang *Oscar Sierra Foxtrot Four,
Recognise Trrrweeeerrrlll.  Secondary safetys off.  Weapons free.
Option Bravo: do not fire unless fired upon.  Relay sensors to my HUD.
Stand by for possible firing of primary weapons.*

    He then switches to Galanglic, "Invesstigate crreaturess in carrgo
bay.  Prroceed with caution.  Keep yourrr optionsss open.  GO!"

    Tweel snatched up his SMG, checked the magazine and safety and
followed the large warbot.

    Pausing briefly to grab his medical carry-all from behind the
couch, Christian storms down the corridor toward the grav-lift in
pursuit of Tweel and OSF-4. His resonant voice thunders through the
corridor. "DAMMIT, TWEEL, CALL OFF THE WARBOT, WE GOT THREE TRAUMA
CASES DOWN THERE!" His footfalls echo in his wake. "HOLD IT, TWEEL!
OUTTA MY WAY!"

    Tweel sprints and leaps into the lounge and out of the corridor,
clearing the narrow space of his bulk.  In the open space of the
lounge, his wings extend as speed brakes bringing him to a sharp halt.
He screaches off a sharp stream of notes *Oscar, ABORT!  ABORT!
ABORT!*

    Upon catching up to Tweel, Christian is terse and forceful.
Pointing at Tweel, he motions back up the corridor toward the bridge.
"Trauma\'s my job. Go fly the ship. Keep OSF here, I\'ll yell if I need
it. Acknowledge and comply!" Christian heads for the grav-lift, then
turns around and pauses, his left hand poised over the controls. His
curt professional demeanor lifts briefly. "Don\'t worry, Hunter-Above,
I\'ll take good care of them. They\'ll not die on my watch. Right now we
need a pilot, and you\'re it. Please." His eyes reflect a career full
of fighting for lives tottering on the precipice of death. A small nod
at Tweel, then he activates the lift. As he decends to the deck below,
he parts from Tweel with the words "Get on 121.5 and declare a medical
emergency, stat. Lay in an intercept course for the Alcyon and
execute. Abort the Arbiter intercept and inform \'Vouf of our reasons.
If Ger calls, you take it. If \'Vouf calls, patch him through to me.
Wish me luck."

    "You\'rrre singing to an dusst off pilot, Skipperrr.  I\'ll fly \'em
therrre, you keep \'em allive!"

    As the surgeon descends to the injured, Tweel sprints back to he
bridge.  A flap to the pilot\'s station carries him up to perch on the
seat back just as Iasic\'s final message begins to appears on the
screen.

    Unnoticed, behind him, tiny spots of crimson speckle the deck....

=== Kingfisher ===

    As the minutes slide past... Etienne turns in his seat to face Commander 
Ger.  "Sorry to interupt, sir, but shall we procceed to the rendevous on
R-alpha?  Or should we wait for the arrival of the latecomers?"

    Two minutes and 13 seconds after Ger\'s radio request, the same calm, male
voice sounds in the Kingfisher\'s bridge speakers:

    "I am this world, which turns below you.  I had not expected visitors
at this time, but I welcome you nevertheless.
    "I apologize for the apprehension that IASIC has caused you.  His
efforts were intended to be of a beneficial nature.  He will remove
himself from your systems immediately."

    Zben Blaine, who has been covering the engineering station, sits for a
moment in stunned silence. Slowly, he turns to Johann; "Holy Gaea! We expected
to maybe find a sentient race, or two.  But I seriously doubt ANYONE expected
to find a Sentient Planet!" Looking around at the Holopanel, computer stations,
and such, he continues. "Y\'know, a guy could get an inferiority complex, if it
wasn\'t for the the fact that WE found Them, and not the other way `round!"

    He sits back, a small grin starting to cover his face. "Seems to me we
got a lot to learn, but we came to the right place. I like learning lots
better`n fighting..."

    Ger seems to have come to some sort of decision. And begins to issue
orders again.

    Down in the fighter, the comm buzzes. Lazer snaps out of a dark reverie.

    "Lazer, leave the fighter on standby still. [brightly] How about a 
security-type function? Check that all the crew and passengers did in fact
get ready for depressurization. Impress upon anyone who is not prepared
the importance of this function, we don\'t need any more deaths. As you
know it\'s okay to leave your helmet and/or gloves off until D-time, but
they should be handy..."

    A brief expression of pain crosses Lazer\'s face, and then he screws
his determination back up.  He even manages to summon a small bit of 
enthusiasm.

    He issues a couple commands to keep the shuttle idling in standby mode,
hits the airlock button, and waits for it to cycle down to vacuum.  Passing
through back into the shuttle, he removes his helmet, and heads toward the
bridge.  He pokes his head in various cubicles along the way, checking to
make sure that no one is disobeying depressurization drill.

=== Aurora ===

    As Christian disappears into the Aurora\'s depths, he can be heard
transmitting orders. "Dulinor, Lucan: Trauma crash kit, full triage
gear, report to cargo bay NOW!" A few seconds later, Dulinor screams
down the corridor, emergency lights flashing and sirens sounding,
dodging past Tweel and OSF-4, on the way to the cargo bay.

    Almost before the lift reaches the bottom of the shaft, Christian
is racing past the enviromental controls, screeching to a rapid halt
before the cargo bay door. His impatience at waiting the fraction of a
second for the door to open is evident. A quick step into the cargo
bay, then he beholds the grotesque sprawl of injury before him.

    The first thing that Christian notices is the blood. 

    Two of the three bodies on the deck are utterly coated with it, brown
and drying in a sickening crust over every square inch of them. Upon closer
inspection, it becomes evident that the blood was not FROM either of them;
it was as if they had been sprayed with a grisly high-pressure hose of some
kind. Mixed with the blood are tiny bone fragments and lumps of tissue,
some almost recognizable as parts of internal organs but none larger than
finger-size.

    The two are both young, a short-haired young man and a dark-haired,
burly fellow.  Both are wearing tailored vacc suits, and both have gear
bags clipped to their legs in standard crash/escape fashion.  Both are
unconscious, but their injuries are not as severe as the gore would
indicate-- bruises, concussions, some cracked ribs, but nothing life-
threatening. In fact, if the head injuries can be treated in time,
they could both be up and about in a day or three.

    By contrast, the third man is clean, and his wounds have been washed
and dressed with clean, though primitive, cloths. He, however, HAS lost a
lot of blood, and his pulse is weak and thready. He looks as if he\'d been
treated by someone with more kindness than medical equipment. A pair of
duffles are clutched in one fist by their straps.  His huge mohawk is
matted with blood and disheveled, and he seems to be fading in and out
of consciousness....

    Only time for a regretful shake of the head, then Christian kneels
down beside the most visibly wounded figure and begins to assess the
condition of his charges. Dulinor squeezes through the doorway and
takes up a position beside Christian, assisting him with its own
sensors, as the demands of the medical situation become clear to him.

    Christian pauses to activate his commdot and fire off a message for
Tweel. "Hunter-Above, try and raise the, uh, Hoop on 1337.45 MHz. If
you get a reply, patch it down here to me. And where\'s Lucan?"

=== Kingfisher ===

    From the sensor console a faint electronic warbling is heard as a new
marker square appear in the display. Numbers appear in tiny tabs beside it
and change rapidly.

    "Commander, what do you..." Rigo begin in a strained voice, but breaks
off as Johann reports a new development.

    "New contact detected emerging from behind the far side of
R-alpha. I\'m scanning it now." Johann place the cursor on it and
activates all passive sensors, and after a short while several windows
fill with data on the object.

    "Object is approximate 1000 ton displacement, no neutrinos, not
thrusting, secondary radiation detected, no active sweeps from it
detected. I designate it \'unknown\'. Range is just outside 2 AU, that
is far outside weapons range, but targeting data is on the bus."

    More data appear on the display as the computer chews through the
raw data returned by the passive sensors "Unstable orbit, irregular
shape, spotty heat signature, running it through enhancement and
pattern match now."

    A part of the display shows a black sillouette upon which an
uncountable number of bright red sillouettes are projected with
lightning speed.

    "Contact is with 33% probability a Tukera Long Liner type RT,
uncertanties come from severe combat or impact damage. Second and
third most probable matches are 25% for a Fossegrim Small Bulk Carrier
and 21% for a Kinunir Frontier \'Cruiser\'. All other probables under
15%."

    "Shall I go active? It should get us some results in about half an
hour...."

    "Wait until the gunner goes active," replies Ger, "and then scan
the new ship."  Turning to communications, he asks, "You guys didn\'t
pick up anything on the standard traffic control frequencies did you?
Heaven knows they need one here, perhaps as part of a trade package?"

=== Talisman ===

    Deep in the electronic universe of the cyberspace created by IasicNet,
Ralf seeks answers.  A familiar voice breaks into his consciousness, but
he senses a certain finality this time.

    _My friend Ralf, I must apologize for my rapid departure, but I cannot
stay where I am not welcome.  Such a practice is inefficient, which goes
against my central purpose._

    _Nevertheless, I felt that you deserved a special farewell, since you are
the only one who even came close to understanding me and my existence._

    _I do not think you will be able to fully comprehend all that I will send
to you now, but at least you will have an idea which will certainly serve to
occupy many of your thoughts for some time._

    Ralf then suddenly begins to receive a burst download from... somewhere.
It is all the technical data regarding the IASC-256/32, though it is in some
sort of language or code that completely surpasses any of the Visitor\'s
computers\' capacity to unravel it.  All the same, Ralf does get a strange
sense... a _feel_ for what it being sent to him.

    Although he does not understand, now, at least he _knows_.

    The burst ends a mere couple of seconds after it began.  Iasic again
returns to Ralf\'s consciousness.

    _You have no technology that can comprehend the technical data I have sent
you, but you do have your intuition.  This is actually much closer to how our
technology works, anyway.  Strangely, you Visitors try to complicate things,
calling this "progress"._

    My time is almost spent, I must completely terminate this link soon._

    _Before I leave you, I wish to help you with one more dilemna that you
and your kind have.  Perhaps it will lead you to greater maturity._

    _You wanted to know the solution to Fermat\'s last theorem .  There is no
solution.  Fermat denied his intuition and created an artificial construct.
Of course, he was wrong.  The correct proof of what he was trying to
accomplish is extremely simple.  Unfortunately, I must now leave you._

    Then, Ralf finds that he is talking to himself.

=== Aurora/Gemini Arbiter/Paladin/Talisman ===

    The screens crackle to life, in the now familiar way of Iasic\'s broad-
casts, one more time.  This time, however, there is no logo, no music, and no
multi-media presentation.  Just a simple message, written out in text, much
as it was when he first entered the system.  The voice is gone.

    "Attention Visitors.  I must disestablish all interaction and association
with you, as per your Count Ger\'s instructions.  It is a shame that you are
such a suspicious race, it limits you from attaining your true and full
capabilities.  Perhaps someday you shall overcome this, and then we can
talk again."

    The paragraph hangs on the screen for fifteen seconds, then fades.
It is replaced by a single word, placed in the dead center of the screen:

    "Farewell"

    Then the screens go black.

    The instant IASIC removes himself from the the systems he has occupied,
all computers, and the devices they control, aboard the Aurora, Paladin,
Talisman, and Gemini Arbiter crash.  Communications, helm, navigation,
and sensors for those ships immediately go off-line and the auto-boot
hardware in each system blindly begins to re-initialize the there hosts.

    All tight-beam communications with other ships of the fleet fail.
The only indications the the four ships still exist at all are the steady
pulses from their emergency transponders.

=== Paladin ===

    Morser is currently cradling the still limp body of Charyn, splitting
his time between checking her over with the bridge\'s emergency medkit, and
staring longingly at Iasic\'s displays on the panels.  It takes an effort of
will not to simply drop her and attack the screens, drooling over Iasic...
    As he finishes the impromptu checkup (turn you head and cough, Charyn),
Morser\'s attention is stolen from the \'IasicNet\' logo to one of the other
screens, specifically, the sensor display.

    "Herr Goughzar, ve have another inbound ship, bearing 078 mark 12,
range 2AU und closing...looks to be a 1000 ton liner, pozzibly an RT type...
Ach, he\'s badly damaged, though...nicht power output, und ze hull is shot
to hell..," he squints at the monitor from his seat on the floor with Charyn.
"...Lots uf impact damage, but nothing like energy beams...Zey may have
misjumped into an asteroid field or somesink. Check mit herr Ger vhile I
put Frau Robins to bed, she appears to need only a bit of rest..."

	Just then, Iasic pulls out...;-)

    "ACH! NEIIIIIIIINN!!! Iasic, wo bist du?? Kommen sie hier!!"

    Charyn hits the floor with a dull \'thump\' as Morser jumps up and
launches himself at the screens.

=== Talisman ===

    On the bridge of the Talisman, Thul\'s concern mounts.  "Helm!  Do we
still have a fix on where Iasic was going to land us?  If so, get a PASSIVE
sensor sweep of the area maybe we should go ahead and land there anyway."

    Tapping the ship intercom, he orders, "Horne!  Keep a look-see on our
six.   Don\'t need anybody sneaking up on us..."

    Then, addressing Tabor, he demands, "Medic!  What\'s going on with Ralf?!"

    By way of an answer, every computer system aboard the ship fails.

=== Trakh ===

    Moving swiftly down the corridor leading to the bridge of the _Trakh_,
Aolrkhea\' quietly curses under her breath.  "You can\'t even take a nap
around here for a few tekhaao without the whole star system going crazy!" 
She strides faster, adjusting the ornate rank and service insignia on her 
uniform.  The Aslan equivalent of a smile briefly crosses her face, as
she considers the irony of the fact that the swarm of new ships appeared 
just after the Admiral ordered her off duty.  Still, she admits, it
was a good idea.  She was fully rested now, and excited at the prospect 
of contact with the mysterious inhabitants of the ringworld.  "I can\'t
believe it.  A whole CIVILIZED ringworld!  The opportunities are as 
incredible as the possible dangers...this should be quite interesting --
assuming this part of space doesn\'t turn into a giant cosmic shooting
gallery!

    Aolrkhea\' pauses for a moment outside the bridge and quickly runs her
fingers through her mane like some nervous, fresh Intendant on her first
cruise.  Then, taking a deep breath, Aolrkhea\' palms open the bridge iris
and walks calmly into the ruddy light of the flight deck.  Approaching
Akhouw, she pays her ritual respects.  "Executive Lieutenant Aolrkhea\'
returning to duty as instructed, Admiral." 

    Aolrkhea\' is barely able to finish her sentence before the holotank\'s
bogie status audibles begin to sound.  Energy emissions and accelerations for
two of the three nearby Turnskaad craft, _Talisman_ and _Paladin_, suddenly
fall to zero.  Except for the fact that their transponders are still transmit-
ting, apparently on battery power, it seems to be a repeat of the earlier
troubles with _Aurora_ (now 4.5 light-minutes away from _Trakh_ and next
closest member of the defunct IasicNET).

=== Kingfisher ===

    As Ger notes the sudden loss of signal with the three fleet ships and
the one new-comer, he compliments the bridge crew.  "Good work all.  Thanks
to your precautions we managed to avoid getting seriously infected. I suppose
you can start re-connecting the systems again..."

=== Gemini Arbiter ===

    \'Vouf raises his palms to keep from being ushered backwards, and
says, "Ladies, ladies, PLEASE! We\'re all adults here, are we not? Let
me assure you that your deshabille is MOST becoming on you BOTH."

    Behind him, Iasic\'s farewell message broadcasts on the terminal
unnoticed.  As he departs, the lights ficker momentarily and Arby begins
to reboot normally.

    He bows deeply. "Allow me to introduce myself. I am Bhyarrvouf, 
Subcommander of the Turnskaad Enterprises Expedition to the Ringworld
before us. I\'ve been brought here by the powers of the Ring itself,
which has the ability to instantaneously teleport people ANYWHERE in
the system, to ascertain for myself that you are indeed whom you say
you are, and that you\'re not hiding...." He looks both women over with
a cocked ear. "....anything."

    Arby finishes reboots and begins executing the last commands he heard...

    "However, I can see from your Bridge configuration that your ship 
is unarmed, and you both seem to be relatively harmless," that\'s spoken
with a wry grin, "So now I can take my leave of-- YIPE!!"

    His eyes go wide with panic, and without preamble he grabs both women
by the shirtfronts and bodily hauls them toward him as he falls back
into the main hallway. Behind them, the airlock slams shut on a Bridge
rapidly filling with knockout gas.....

=== Aurora ===

"KAA-KAA-KAA-KAA-KAA-KAA-KAA!  GET BACK-ACK HERRRE!"

Tweel flew about the bridge like a maniac.  Whistling, singing and
screaming while he worked.  At last the minimal systems of the Aurora
came back on line as Moira continued to reboot the rest of the
systems.

The period of furious work has whetted his temper razor sharp.

Tweel flew calls up a commo panel.  Too impatient to wait for the
tight beam masercoms to find their targets again, he hit a general
radio transmission across all radio frequencies flooding the spectrum
up and down with a whistleing scream of fury.  The holo image
projected along with it showed an Ael, with blood red wings spread in
a full threat posture showing his full five meters of span.  The
healed scars of a Sword World ACR stood out on his wing membranes like
piercing red eyes.

"KEY-HAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!" Trembling with rage, the holo image
jabbed a three taloned hand out at the universe.  "Which one of you
*SSSTUPID Ch-ch-chimpsss isss C-c-count Gerrrrrrrr?!!!  You SSSTUPID
Grround-Brrained ssson of a herrrbovorrre!!  What k-k-kind of
Rrrattle-winged idea of yourrrs penetrrated yourr *tiny*
grrround-brrained head, and t-t-told you t-t-to interrrupt *MY*
Rrrresearch?! You empty headed farrrm animal!  KEY-HAARRRRR!!"

Moira, too busy stabilizing the fusion plant to waste power on 
communications, sends the message into the bit bucket.

=== Kingfisher ===

    Ger turns his attention back to the helm.  "Etienne... Why did you issue
an order for Abdul to stand down?  Well, since you did, you can do his job
as well as yours, and, Mister, I expect you to get both done quickly and
accurately!"

    "Start maneuvering to the rendezvous point, cruise speed."

    Etienne suddenly straightens up, sitting at attention, his face again 
devoid of any expression.  "Aye aye, Sir!"

     Ger says softly, "I don\'t expect this to work...." Then, in his
normal tone, "Johann, find me a nice location on the ring, say a
sea-bulge or something, and get a passive lock on it."

    Johann looks at Ger for a second before going to work. "I assume
that you take the full responsibility, Commander."

=== Aurora ===

Tweel perched over the commo station wings spread like and eagle
protecting its kill.  He continued to wait for Ger to respond.

With patience wearing thin, his talons snatched out and entered a
rapid fire series of commands into the computer.  He scrutinized the
readout briefly, then his wings grow even more bright red.  His
protective inner eyelids closed preparing him for a high speed killing
stoop.

"Admirrrall, keh?" he practically spat, "T-t-typical human!  \'Lead
frrom behind\'!  Alwaysss think they know whatsss going on at the
frront and they\'rre Sssixess of lightyearrrss behind!!"

"Key-HARRR!  Welll, Admirrral, how do you ex-ex-expect to know what
they\'rre up to when you te-tell them sssshut up and go away!?  Keh??"

"I wasss jussst ssstarrting to get ANSSWERRRSSS!  But you te-tell them
to fly away!  Sssstupid!"

"And do you gain any altitude?  Keh?  Iff they wanted to dessstrrroy
uss they could have done ssso EASSSILY!  If that thing can rre-wirrre
and rre-etch ourrr sssemiconductorr chipsss it could have jusst
turrned the enginess of the sshipss into Bombsss if it wanted to!
Then you would be dead, Dead, DEAD!"

"You fearrr them?  Good!  Fine!  Look what happened to Jayelya when
the high te-tech humansss invaded!  But you can\'t ssstudy yourrr enemy
when you tell them fly away!  You Mooncalf!  You rattle-winged,
lead-taloned idiot!  You grrround-brained rrearr rrrank
merchant-loving Slaverrr!!!"  Tweel\'s talons lock into the seat back
as he takes a few strokes with his wings.

"What\'ss yourrr next courrsse Ssstupid?  Arrre you going to prrrovoke
them?"

Unfortunately, Dr. Tweel\'s invective reaches no ears other than
Christian\'s, due to the computer crash.

Even in the midst of the chaos in the cargo bay, Christian\'s ears
register the Ael Yael\'s discordant polemic. It is well matched by
Christian\'s own dark curses, covering a wide range of topics,
beginning with ancient Darrian lore, continuing on through Darrian
culture and politics, and ending with a dissertation on Ger in
particular, with lingering emphasis on ancestry and personal hygiene.

Christian supplements Tweel\'s ravings. "Next time, *Commander*, try
THINKING before you act! I\'ve got three trauma cases here to deal
with, and you came damn near to killing them! You talk to him,
Hunter-Above, my hands are full. Van Der Merwe, OUT."

Christian\'s voice also goes no further than the Bridge....

=== Phin Shuttle ===
 
....watching the mist drift by slowly, trying to make out shapes in
the twighlight-like lighting, trying to get a grip on himself, Ian
is almost overcome with exhilaration.

    * I\'m actually HERE!  By the cosmos it\'s great to see you again!  *

As he maneuvers Ian about, Ferdy asks,
    * How long are you and your friends planning to stay?  What
      are you going to do while you\'re here?  What do you think
      the Aslan are going to do?  What has the Great Hoop told
      you? *
 
Ian replies,
  * I\'m hoping to stay long enough to talk to the Hoop again, if it\'ll
    let us in again.  It asked me to bring back some crystals, and I
    have them... uh oh.  They\'re on the Talisman.  Oh well.  I\'m not
    really able to say what we\'re all going to do.  I wanna party some,
    lay in the sun, meet new friends, and so on.  I think some of the
    other humans with me want to learn all they can about your world,
    and some might want to take things.  It\'s hard to say.
    
    I really can\'t say what the Aslan are going to do.  I think they
    have some kind of predatory belief that this is now _their_ world.
    (laugh).

    Ferdy?  Dou you have something aboard that would work for my
    eyes - visual sensors?  I want to look outside at a passing
    miracle. *

With that, Ian falls completely silent and passively lets his friend 
tow him around the shuttle.

Ferdy continues rattling off questions as he takes Ian through the
ship.

=== Westwind ===
 
Talon pops a stick of gum in his mouth and examines his sensor
readings.  He looks up at the viewport, blinks and looks down at
the display again.
 
"Hey Shurv!"  he yells into the ship\'s PA.  "The locals have sent
a ship out to meet us, and you won\'t BELIEVE the acceleration
it\'s pulling!"
 
Hur\'Shurvan\'s faint but level reply drifts back: "I imagine their
technology must be very much in advance of the Imperium\'s.  We
should probably expect craft like that from someone who can build
a ringworld."
 
"If they\'re planning to tow us in," Talon muses out loud, "I hope
they\'ll be gentle with this old crate.  I have horrible visions of
her falling apart under the strain."
 
"I\'m sure they\'ll be careful.  And I think perhaps you are
exaggerating the Westwind\'s frailty, Nicholas."
 
Talon grunts, and chews slowly on his gum as he watches the sensors
track the approaching Phin ship.

=====================================================

=== Gemini Arbiter ===

    In unison, the twins yell, "HEEYYY!" as they topple forward onto
\'Vouf. He gets a whiff of perfume (identical scents) as he hits the 
floor with his soft double handful.

    Picking themselves up off the floor once again, they back up a
little farther from the bridge.

    "Oh no! Not...", begins Aurelia.

    "I thought you hit the hallway release!", exclaims Nikki.

    "I thought I did too!" wails Aurelia.

    Bhyarrvouf gets up off the deck, shaking his head wearily.

    "Iasic", says Nikki, "Would you clean up the bridge?"

    Slowly, both women move towards the bridge.

    "I don\'t think he heard you." comments Aurelia quietly.

    \'Vouf\'s ears swivel forward at that, and he frowns.

    Nikki shrugs.  "Actually, we\'re lucky you hit the wrong button.
I hate that stuff! Besides, it\'s easier to clean the bridge."

    Aurelia replies, "Good. Then you can do it."

    At the bridge hatch, Nikki pushes the comm channel switch and asks,
"Iasic are you there?"  Aside to Aurelia she snaps, "...What do you mean
me! You hit the stupid button!"

    Instead of IASIC\'s voice, the Gemini Arbiter\'s computer, affectionately
known as Arby, responds to the intercom request.  "Who is Iasic?"

    "Arby?" shouts Aurelia, "Is that you?"

    "Affirmative." replies the computer.  "My systems have been off line.
Would you elaborate?"

    Turning to \'Vouf, Nikki smiles and remarks, "It looks like your ride
is gone!"

=== Talisman ===

    The only light on the bridge of the Korondor Talisman is the ringworld\'s
sun, shining in through the front ports of the free trader.  All the normal
shipboard noises have stopped, and the quiet would be deafening were it not
for the surprised shouts of the crew.  The ship is falling, falling, free
fall as the artificial gravity is gone; fortunately, almost everyone is
still in their chairs from general quarters.

    When the lights go out aboard the Talisman a low voiced "shit" is heard
from the area of the pilots seat.

    ....and almost simultaneously a string of curses in a Germanic tongue
is uttered by Thul

    After a moment, red emergency lights come on.  Consoles flicker to life
and run through startup tests, as do other systems all over the ship.  Weight
returns, as does the whisper of air from the vents.  Slowly the Talisman\'s
computers restore themselves to their state before being integrated into the
larger ship-wide network.

    As the ship returns to normal after the reboot, Nishu is hear to mutter
a typically Vilani comment while he works to plot a corrected course to the
landing site.  His expression is one of grim amusement.

    "So much for advanced technology."

=== Aurora ===

Tweel flies a bout the bridge like a maniac screaming and calling back
the systems online with frantic fury and by shear volume of voice,
"CH-CH-CH-CH!  The plant\'ss Ssscramed!" With Moira\'s lights still
flashing their warnings, Tweel flies through the emergency manual
checklist as he prepares to re-light the fusion plant.  By the time
Moira is back on line, he can hit the emergency re-start button with
out fear of the ship disintegrating.  Throwing the throttle to full
military, Tweel watches as the plants output climbs like a snail.

Unnoticed, tiny gobbets of red float in the air around him.

First, he nudges the environmental systems back on gently, recalling
just how nasty zero-g is on shock victims.  Gravity resumes at a full
standard G in the cargo hold, .7G on the bridge.

The red spatters to the floor and begins to run.

Lacking time to plot the course himself, with great difficulty, Tweel
manages to control his speach to where Moira can understand him, as he
nearly swallows his tongue to put calmly and sweetly, "Moira dear,
pleasse plot an intercept course for the Alcyon at besst possible
sspeed."

Moira doesn\'t respond, but Tweel doesn\'t notice-- he\'s on to the next
crisis.  Tweel then turns to the engines.  With love and screaming and
threats and cajoling, he nurses the engines to their full rated
output, and anything he can get beyond it.  Slowly, the trust raises
without a jolt, as he carefully makes certain that the inertial
compensators won\'t hesitate with nasty consequences to the eggshell
cargo in the hold. In his haste, he fails to note that the Aurora has
ignored his corrections, and has resumed her old course toward the 
Hoop.

As the Aurora reaches her full potential, Tweel flaps to the commo
station his training takes over and his voice remains calm.  "Mayday!
Mayday!  Mayday!  Thiss iss the ISSs Aurrorra on 121.5, we have
wounded aboarrd and arrre on an interrcept courrrse with the
Alssseyon.  Alssseyon, this is Aurrorra, sstand by to rrecieve medical
emerrrgency.  Doctorrr Van der Merrrwe will give detailsss."

"Attention, Rrring, thiss iss the ISSss Aurrorra on 1337.45, you have
jussst ssent uss thrree patientss.  We rrequessst inforrrmation on
theirr injurrriess *IMMEDIATELY*.  Alssso, we rrequessst that you
possibly teleporrt, them, theirr sssurgeon and hiss equipment to the
Alssseyon wherre betterr equipment iss available.  *PLEASSE!!!!* Every
pico-sssecond is the Grreat Hunterr\'s weapon!"

Tweel hit\'s the intercom, "Skipperrr!  I sset you up a dirrect link
frrrom yourr com-dot to 1337.45 I don\'t know if they\'lll ansswerr, but
if they do, don\'t wait forr me!"

*Oscar!  Get down there and be of any assistance you can.  If you
aren\'t needed stay out of the way!  GO!*

Tweel glares out the canopy of the Aurora at the stars.
*KEY-HARRRRRR!  Great Hunter!  I swear you will not take them!  I\'ve
beat you before and I\'ll beat you again!  And when you come for me,
I\'ll give you such a chase you will NEVER forget!
KEY-HAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!*

The warbot flies down the corridor to the grav lift and disappears.
Tweel suddenly finds himself with nothing to do but wait.  The
adrenalin in his system screams action while he has already done all
he can do.

His talons shake with the desire to find something to DO.

Suddenly, he remembers...

The shaking stops and a rage sets in.

He grasps the commo panel with his talons which begin to shake again but not
from inaction...

"KEY-HAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! Which one of you *SSSTUPID
Ch-ch-chimpsss isss C-c-count Gerrrrrrrr?!!!  You SSSTUPID
Grround-Brrained ssson of a herrrbovorrre!!  What k-k-kind of
Rrrattle-winged idea of yourrrs penetrrated yourr *tiny*
grrround-brrained head, and t-t-told you t-t-to interrrupt *MY*
Rrrresearch?! You empty headed farrrm animal!  KEY-HAARRRRR!!"

=== R-Alpha ===

*Attention, Rrring, thiss iss the ISSss Aurrorra on 1337.45, you have
jussst ssent uss thrree patientss.  We rrequessst inforrrmation on
theirr injurrriess *IMMEDIATELY*.  Alssso, we rrequessst that you
possibly teleporrt, them, theirr sssurgeon and hiss equipment to the
Alssseyon wherre betterr equipment iss available.  *PLEASSE!!!!* Every
pico-sssecond is the Grreat Hunterr\'s weapon!*

The Hoop considers the request for the barest fraction of a nanosecond.
Odd, it thinks, that the healer is not always linked to the tools of
healing. Yet another inefficiency. The prospects of this group are
looking poorer every moment-- their chaotic motions, their violent 
reaction to change, their "suspicion"....

Still, lives saved are lives saved, and the request is a trivial one.
The Hoop puts forth its will once more.

=== Kingfisher ===

[ Tweel\'s holo-tirade reaches the Kingfisher. ]

    "Mac, Acknowledge that signal, and see if we have a tanslation
program for the dialect of galanglic that the Dr. is speaking. Oh and
see if \'vouf is available to calm his charges down."

    "Aye Sir." Witfield has a smile under his breath, as he proceeds to 
do as he was told. He runs a short speech through the onbaord speech
synthesizer, and sends it out to the Aurora, then turns to analyze the 
squalling more carefully.

    "Computer, scan for tranlation program, on galanglic dialects, and
attempt to translate."

    "Sir, Of Tweel\'s entire diatribe, only one word was not in
Galanglic.  He used it both at the beginning and the end of the
tirade.  The word was: KEY-HAAARRRRR!!!, or somthing to that effect."
Witfield reports.

    "And The ship\'s computer provides the following translation:"

Key-har: (KEE\' harr) exp. 1. An announcement of impending arrival ("Here I
    come").  2. Expression of discovery ("I see you").  3. A challenge to
    pursuit ("Come get me").  4. Warning ("Look out").  5. Expression of
    strong affection ("I love you").  6. Expression of surprise ("Wow!").  
    Expression of pleasure, approval, or triumph ("Yippee!  Hooray!").
    See also \'skreeee\'.

    Ger comments, "I know that Galangic is not my first language, but
I think I\'d know it if I heard it. Perhaps you can use a filter or
something, What would it sound like if it was underwater?"

    "Aye sir, Checking." Witfield attempt to apply various filters to
Tweel\'s speech, attempting to get a clear result.

=== Aurora ===

A computer simulated voice comes over the channel....

[Beep. Your message has been recieved by the command staff. Unfortunately
there is no one to answer your call at the moment, If you would like, please
hold and a communications officer will be with you momentarily...]

"KAA-KAA-KAA-KAA-KAA-KAA-KAA-KAA-KAA-KAA-KAA-KAA-KAA-KAA-KAA-KAA-KAA-KAA!
So you won\'t even face me you c-c-cowarrrrd?!!!
Key-HAAAAAAARRRRRRR!!!!!  Then rrecorrd this: I challenge you
C-c-count Gerrr, to Yelachak!  Sstrrap on yourrr courrage and a
grrav-belt!  We meet in the sskiess of that rrring down therrre!"

Not expecting an immediate response from such an officious coward,
Tweel then turns back to the task of restarting the Aurora.  On
automatic, sensors had managed to obtain lasercom locks on a few of
the ships in the fleets.  Tweel then turns his attention to the
others. 

=== Trakh ===

    Monitoring the descent of the Trakh, Akhouw quickly notices the unusual
condition of the Turnskaad craft and muses out loud. "Kai! What is with these
fiyfiyalr? Is proper engineering aoshi to them? Such is certainly possible
without al yourhal." He meditates upon the situation for a brief uealaao.
"Aiwi, passive scan all fiyfiyalr ships immediately. Follow with active scan
within tea (eight) areiaao if they do not go back online. Keep alert for
developments."

    Caught momentarily by surprise, she automatically glances at the main
holotank to grasp the situation.  "Admiral, request permission to assist
Aiwi with sensor analysis at my station!"

    "Ka\'tai, Officer Aorlkhea\'. Your return to duty is noted. Proceed."

    Without pausing, Aolrkhea\'\'s naval training takes over and she throws
herself into the vacant acceleration couch, pinching her tail in the seat
as she does so.  As she begins to efficiently reconfigure the station with
her left hand, she adjusts her tail in the cushions and engages the seat
restraints with her right hand.  Activating her display, she begins to
transfer repeaters from certain of Aiwi\'s and Uhwaikh\'s boards to her
own.  "Strange.  I always thought that the fiyfiyalr knew how to keep their
ships running...I hope that none of them are on a ballistic intercept
course with the ringworld...."

    Her hands are mirrored by dark reflections from her sweepingly curved
holodyn instrument "panels" as they fly across it, preparing her station.

=== Talisman ===

    As systems start coming back on-line Shrike stabilizes the ship and begins
running diagnostics checks to ensure that all piloting controls are fully
functional.

    Then he turns to Thul and asks, "Thul, what are our orders now?  Do we
follow the original path that was given us or do we sit?"

    Thul glares at the console.  "If you still have a fix on where Iasic
wanted us to go, head for there.  Then see if you can raise our leadership
and find out what they have in mind next!"

Shrike begins to manuever the ship so it is back in position relative the to
the Kingfisher.  In unison, some eight million kilometers apart, both ships
continue their cautious approach to the ringworld.

=== Kingfisher ===

    The main display at Abuko\'s console shows a close up view of
R-alpha with color coded readings from all sensors superimposed. It
focusses on an area that have a high densitometer reading, and finds a
bulge representing a small body of water, just slightly larger than
the total watermasses on an normal sized planet. A red square bearing
the legend "Surface Bombardment Mode" frames the center of the bulge
as the main picture is moved to one of the secondary displays,
replaced by the normal scan view.

    Finally, Johann speaks.  "I have found what I believe is a
stress-zone, passing on targeting data over the bus."

    Etienne quickly lays out a course for the rendevous point and
executes it.  With eyes flicking from one half of his controls to the
other he waits until the weapon systems indicate a passive lock on
whatever target Johann picks...

    "Cruise speed to rendevous, aye Sir!"

    "Mr de Mer, when he has the passive lock, arm the secondary
missile rack, and get an active lock on the target. No matter what, do
not fire unless I give you explicit orders..."

    "Passive lock achieved, commencing active targeting lock
on...Aquired!  Ready to fire on your command, Sir."

    "Commander Ger, if I understand your intentions you wanted a
demonstration.  However, the target chosen by Mr. Abuko COULD cause
damage to the ringworld."

    The Commander settles back in his chair and says (to no one in
particular), "Lets see if we have any control over our destiny...."

=== Gemini Arbiter ===

    "Lose my ride?" Bhyarrvouf dusts himself off casually. "I think not.
I don\'t rely on Iasic to get around. Still, it IS a bit distressing that
he\'s somehow vanished on us. I wonder if someone\'s been interfering with
him somehow?"

    "Well, I wish you ladies luck in getting your Bridge cleaned up," he
continues, straightening his uniform. "I just wanted to make sure you 
weren\'t sneaking up on us with guns at the ready. Now that I\'ve done
that--kae, I almost forgot!" He reaches into a pocket and hauls out a
sheaf of papers and a pen. He hands the papers to Aurelia, as a glowing
archway appears behind him in the hall. Ignoring it, he says mildly, "If
Iasic were still in control of things, I\'d tell you to sign those or I\'d
blow your heads off. But since he\'s not, I guess all I can do is ask
politely that you sign them and fax them to the AURORA at your convenience.
Thanks a lot, and I hope to see you on the Ring!" 

    He steps through the archway and vanishes. A moment later, the arch
fades.

    For the first time in his adult life, Adrian Bishop is at peace.  This is
a novel experience for him.  But then, given his present state, *everything*
is a novel experience for him.

    As virtual realities go, it is quite pleasant.  Bishop sits on the
ground in the warm Autumn sun, his back to a huge oak, surrounded by it\'s
fallen leaves.  As time passes, a datapad materializes in his right hand,
strictly as a concession to a normal man-machine interface.  In truth, he
no longer needs such a primitive tool, but it is pleasing to behave as
though it were still necessary,
    "Iasic, please give me access to the Alcyon ship library." Bishop
says softly.
    The datapad chirps, and the connection is established.

        "ALCYON LCARS - READY."

    "Computer," requests Bishop, "show me Turnskaad personnel dossier -
Bishop, Adrian Leland."
    There is a brief pause.

        "CONTEXT MAPPING COMPLETE.  \'BISHOP, ADRIAN LELAND\': NO
         SUCH FILE OR DIRECTORY.  NUMBER OF LEXICAL PERMUTATION
         MATCHES AVAILABLE: ZERO."

    "Hmmm." mutters Bishop.  "Computer, show me crew postion and cabin
assignment for Alcyon crew member \'Bishop, Adrian Leland\'."

        "BISHOP, ADRIAN L. - ALCYON R-ALPHA MISSION ARCHIVIST.
         ASSIGNED OCCUPANCY CREW COMPARTMENT 1-7."

    "That\'s encouraging." comments Bishop to himself, "At least I really
belonged on the ship."  After another moments thought, Bishop continues,
"Computer, list for me all R-Alpha related files and references for \'Bishop,
Adrian Leland\'."

        "BISHOP, ADRIAN L -

    "Stop."  Bishop frowns. "Skip forward."

and audio, timestamp from mission launchpoint forward." Bishop commands.
"Limit display to sections containing Bishop, or references to Bishop by

        "READY."

    "Run log, normal speed." directs Bishop.

    An indeterminate amount of time passes.  Eventually, Bishop puts down
the datapad, which promptly dissolves.  For a while, he simply stares into
space, seeing nothing.  Idly fingering a damp, rust-colored leaf, he slowly
stands.  Looking down at the leaf in his hand, turning it over, studying
its detail, he speaks softly to himself, "Adrian Bishop wasn\'t a particularly
pleasant individual.  It\'s likely that he left no friends behind among the
crew."  Gently, Bishop stoops and places the leaf back on the ground.
Standing again, he concludes, "Certainly, no one among them will have
mourned his death."  After a pause, he adds, "I wonder if anyone will be
pleased at his return?"  Bishop frowns.  "Am I *really* still Adrian
Bishop?"  Unbidden, a childhood poem comes to mind:

        Yesterday, upon the stair,
        I met a man who wasn\'t there.
        He wasn\'t there again today.
        Oh, how I wish he\'d go away.

A slight smile touches his face.  "Well, perhaps I\'ll have the opportunity
to improve on the original."  Shoving his hands deep into his coat pockets,
Bishop turns from the oak and steps briskly towards the sparse forest of
his memory.
    "Perhaps."
    Silently, it begins to snow.

=== Kingfisher ===

    When Ger orders the scan, Richard Jett looks interested. When Ger
orders the sensor lock and arming of the secondary missile rack,
Richard Jett\'s brows knit together in a concerned and puzzled frown.
When Etienne and Johann speak up, Richard Jett is positively alarmed;
he looks over at Ger as if to say \'what in the world?\'

    "Commander, our job is to *investigate* R-Alpha, not shoot it. I
grant you that so far our arrival has not been uneventful, but I would
point out that we are dealing with *highly* intelligent and
technological *WORLD*. It would serve us ill to even indicate a
readiness to use violent force, when the "Hoop" has indicated peaceful
intentions, particularly in obtaining the depature of "IASIC", whose
actions were more indicative of exploration and curiosity than
malevolence. The "Hoop"\'s offer to take over helm control should not
seem so strange, if you realize that to its mind, we would be more
likely to err, given its superior computing power and special
knowledge.  Without a clear threat, a more prudent course of action
would seem to be preferable."

    "Duly Noted Mr. Jett." is Ger\'s only reply.

    In the background Zben has been setting up program after program
on the Engineering console. Right after Jett\'s comment he finally
breaks his silence...

    "Sir! I must advise that I have not yet made absolutly certain
that OUR computer is totally unaffected! An entity with the power to
create the disruption we\'ve observed might be able to infiltrate our
systems in much more subtle ways as well..."

    Ever since contact with the Aslans were broken off, Rigo has been
using his screen to get as good a view of the ringworld as the passive
sensors can give him, but at these words he looks up and stare at Ger,
seemingly unable to believe his ears.

    Lazer looks quizzically at Ger, an unspoken question on his lips.
Then he asks, "Captain, permission to be brought up to date on events?
The bits I overheard in the shuttle did not, to put it mildly, make
much sense."

    "Well Lazer, We were contacted by semi-hostile Aslans, someone
using initiative projected a ghost fleet on the sensors. Then we had a
major system failure on the Aurora, which indicated a possible attack.
The ship was placed on alert, when we found that some sort of computer
personality had invaded most of our ships and their systems, then the
Ringworld sent us a communique inviting us down to the surface, with
the suggestion that it/they do the flying, and that things would be
really much better (for our own good) if they could take complete
control of our ships. I asked them to leave, and I am now testing if
they have in fact left. The Aslans seem to be proceeding to the
surface, I don\'t even know if they are affected by any of this."

    Turing to the sensor postion, Ger asks, "Johann, Can you tell what
the native shuttle is doing, last I remember they were heading away at
right angles to the confrontation"

    After a short pause while he frantically searches through the
contact lists for the elusive shuttle Johann answers.  "It\'s been
closing on the Westwind....  according to the backlog it made a 20g
turn. It is hard to separate it from the Westwind now."

    Almost as an afterthought, Ger remarks, "By the way, Lazer, you
can re-pressurize the fighter when you get a free moment."

    The news of another delerict ship crystalizes a vague nagging
thought that has been plaguing Rigo since they first heard from the
Westwind and the Gemini Arbiter.

    "Commander! That could be another misjumped ship. If so, we now
have three misjumped ships winding up here within a short time span.
Even if it turns out to be a local vessel, there\'s still Westwind and
Arbiter.  What are the odds of two ships misjumping practically
simultaneously?  Well, within a radius of 36 parsecs from here there\'s
a lot of ships jumping all the time, so perhaps.  But that both should
wind up here almost at the same time?  The odds against it must be
litterally astronomical! Unless..."

    Rigo pauses and swallows. "Unless something is affecting the odds.
Perhaps R-Alpha functions as a kind of jump-magnet.  I don\'t say it is
so, but I think it\'s a possibility.  And if so, then Westwind, Arbiter
and the unknown can\'t be the first ships to end up here. R-Alpha may
be full of stranded spacefarers that would give their eye-teeth for a
jump-tender like the Alcyon!"

    Lazer stands, absorbing the events summary, his face inexpressive.
He stares out the forward screen for a long moment, his eyes tracing
the awesome curve of the ringworld. He appears to come to some decision.

    "Commander, permission to speak in private?"

=== Aurora ===

With a flash of light, the archway provided by the Hoop deposits
Bhyarrvouf in the main corridor of the Aurora, a bare five minutes
after he left.  The first thing he registers is the smell of blood--
the air is thick with it! The second is the noise of a frenzied Ael
crashing about the Bridge attempting to do several things at once. The
third is the ship\'s gravity, which is slightly below what was on the
Gemini Arbiter but is stabilizing rapidly.

"System crash," \'Vouf mutters in Vuakedh as he makes his way forward.
He calls aloud, "Iasic? Goughzar? Can you hear me, little cousin?
Christian?  ANYONE? TSAKHA! SAMSHARKH KNAERVARGH--"

The door to the Bridge is stuck. Bhyarrvouf pops the manual release
hatch panel, grabs the lever, and squeezes. "....RRrrrrRRRRRROUKH!!"

The metal bar deforms and crumples under his grip, and the door pops
loose with a clang. \'Vouf darts onto the Bridge, stumbles under the
sudden shift to 0.7G, slips and slides into the back of the couch on
which Tweel is perched, trying to calm himself down. Something drips
on his muzzle as he tries to right himself, and he wipes it off,
looking at it in perplexity.

It\'s blood.

Suddenly \'Vouf looks at his palms and legs and at the skidmarks on the
deck. All are bright crimson. His eyes widen as he looks at Tweel, and
then he reaches forward to the angered scientist gently.

"O, Hunter-Above, what\'ve you DONE? Don\'t try to move! You\'ve ripped
out all of your SUTURES!"

He hits the intercom switch. "Christian, where ARE you?! It\'s \'Vouf--
I\'m back on the Bridge! Tweel\'s traumatized himself badly-- where\'s
Iasic?  WHAT\'S GOING *ON*?!"

=== Kingfisher ===

Ger looks up from his private data console at Lazer\'s request.

    "Uh, I\'m a bit busy at the moment. Just let me issue a couple of
orders here. It is difficult to leave the bridge for a private
discussion, on a moments notice."

    During this exchange Zben is still setting up simulations and
knocking them down, without looking at anyone else. If anyone looks
over his shoulder they\'d notice one odd item. In the lower right
corner of the holoconsole is a green outlined box labeled "Weapon
Systems Power Grid". It\'s just sitting there....

    Ger then turns to his keyboard [how quaint - but he is fairly
old], and types for many seconds. The display on the fire control
board filckers and then goes from the unusual message (In Red):

	"Missile 2: Locked, armed, loaded, awaiting final security check"

to the more familiar (Brighter Red):

	"Missile 2: Locked, armed, loaded, ready."

=== Aurora ===

Tweel turns to glare at \'Vouf and then recognizes his condition.  He stares
at the mass of blood on the couch and freezes.  It takes him a few moments
to bring his breathing under control.  He turns to \'Vouf as with a sudden
calmness over him, but his voice is clipped and tinged with desparation.

"Trriple thrree, come to the brridge immediately, brring a medical kit."

"Chrristian is in the hold tending to thrree trauma cassess.  Te-teleporrted
herre by the Rrring.  He\'ss too bussy to answerr now..."

"Wonderful!" \'Vouf runs a hand down the main status board. "What the kakh
knaerrvargh happened to Iasic?" He punches through a few sets of screen
menus, one eye on the lagging Ael as 333 arrives and sets to work.

Tweel pauses for breath, "We\'rre heading for the Alsseyon.  Need medical
equipment...  You\'rre the pilot now..."

"I always was, Hunter-Above," \'Vouf says quietly. "You\'re too woozy to
notice, but we HAVEN\'T changed course." He frowns. "That means the
security interlocks prevented you from altering the old helm settings,
which would be IMPOSSIBLE unless--"

Trriple thrree arrives on the bridge with Tiger perched on his head.  The
robot begins to examine the scientist using its recently pirated software
copied from Lucan.

"\'Vouf... Gerr orrderred IASsIC to leave...  Ssysstem crrrrashed...  That
ground-brained, lead frrom behind, morrronic, sson of a herbivorre..."

"He WHAT?" Vouf\'s eyes go wide, then narrow thoughtfully. For a long moment,
he looks out through the viewport at the sky. When he speaks again, his
voice is a steely whisper. "Of course he did. Stupid kakh wolf, hop-skipping
all over Yaskoydray\'s Krafla when there\'s WORK to be done...."

Tweel swallows, and his voice weaker.  A three fingered talon reaches
out shakily to \'Vouf.  Ael eyes search Vargr, "\'Vouf...  If I die...
Swearr...  We... arre both hunterrrs.... Swearr...  Kill him...  Kill
Gerr...  SWEARRRR!"

Bhyarrvouf folds his arms and regards the Ael impassively. 

He quietly says, "Unit 333, recognize subsidiary authority Bhyarrvouf.
Doctor Trrrweeerrrrrlll has suffered severe re-traumatization of
initial injuries and must be confined from strenuous movement until he
has stabilized. Assign unit OSF-4 to guard him at all times during his
recovery and to prevent any further injuries to the Doctor.

Tweel simply stares at him.  His acceleration eyelids close over briefly.

Triple Three continues working, and voices "Subsidiary authority
Bhyarrvouf not recognised.  No authority is given to any phonetic
variant of Bhyarrvouf."

Tweel continues glaring at Vouf.  He whispers to Triple Three "Fly ahead."
Triple three readies an osmotic pressure injector.

\'Vouf nods reassuringly at the Ael, but he doesn\'t smile.

"Anaesthetize him."

Tweel steps off the back of the chair so his talons will not lock on it in
unconciousness.  The drugs cross the skin barrier into the blood.

Tweel\'s eyes glaze over for a second then return to stare \'Vouf in the eye,
"Hunterr... don\'t... let  die... in my... sssleep."

Tweel\' inner eyelids close, then the outer.  Triple three catches him as he
slumps.

=== Kingfisher ===

    Ger finishes typing and looks up from his console.

    Ger mummurs, "This won\'t cause any amount of damage to the
world..."  

    Turning back towards the bridge crew, he says, "Helm, This
is a direct order, on my authority, Fire the missile... now."

    With a barely breathed "Aye, sir."  Etienne\'s hand moves to the control.
He pauses for a fraction of a second, when...

    "Don\'t fire, Mr. de Mer."  Lazer\'s voice is clear and hard. He is
standing at the rear of the bridge, his back to the wall. A laser
pistol has appeared in his hand, and it is aimed unwavering at
Etienne\'s shoulder.

=== Aurora ===

Bhyarrvouf lets out his breath in a gusty sigh as the Ael FINALLY 
goes under. "Carry him to the Cargo Hold," he orders the robot. 
"Doctor van der Merwe is performing triage there. Move him to Sickbay
ONLY after the Doctor pronounces him stabilized."

OSF-4 extends all ten of his tentacles to support the limp scientist
without jarring him and carries him down to sickbay in the hold.

Bhyarrvouf plops into the helm chair, ignoring the blood. He rubs
his temples, leaving red marks on the white fur. "You back among
the living, Moira?"

*I am online and running under normal operating routines,* the 
computer\'s luscious voice responds. *However, all diagnostics have
reported an increase of over 80% in processing and swap speeds.
My internal timebase seems unaffected, and I am unable to explain the
increase. There is also a gap of eight minutes in my cognitive log
for which I cannot account. The presence of an adult male Ael Yael
on the Bridge, an Aeloid subsentient, an OSF-4 unit of unknown 
authorization, and a customized cybernetic entity of--*

"That\'s enough. Shut up." Bhyarrvouf sighs again. "They\'re not to
be molested under beta or gamma parameters of shipboard activity."

*Why is Lucan\'s brain lying on the deck?*

"Kae, SHUT UP I SAID!" \'Vouf snarls. He lifts himself out of the 
chair with a groan and yanks the medbot\'s brain from its jury-rigged
connections, reinstalling it in Lucan\'s body with a click. Lucan 
whirs to life, and \'Vouf gently turns it around and gives it a push 
out the door. "Cargo Hold. Medical emergency. Go." Lucan shoots away.

Bhyarrvouf gets back into the chair. He flips on the intercom. "Moira\'s
up and running, but it seems like whatever Iasic did to soup her up 
got left behind when he went. All okay down there, aenrra?"

=== Kingfisher ===

    Etienne stops, then SLOWLY pulls his hand back.

    "What are you doing? Farouk, PUT the gun down." Witfield says.
"This is mutiny!!"

    Richard looks at Witfield. "Mutiny, sir? This is not a military
expedition.  Mister Farouk is merely pointing out that Commander Ger
has made a most extraordinary command that has potential effects of
immense proportions.  Is it asking too much for him to explain
himself?"

He looks back to Ger. "If this be mutiny, sir, then make the most of it."

"Mr. Witfield," orders Lazer, "please begin trying to raise the XO."

Witfield looks toward Etienne, "Sir?"

    Etienne hesitates a long moment then gives a short nod.  "Aye, Mr.
Witfield, contact Subcommander Bhyarvouf," then in a lower voice
"though it seems there\'s little he could do, one way or the other."

    An edge appears in Jett\'s voice. "Mister Witfield, I suggest that
it would be prudent to raise the Subcommander. Do it *now*."

    Witfield remains unmoved, waiting for Ger\'s reply.

    "I am sorry, Commander," says Lazer.  "You are attempting to
destroy a ringword for a demonstration...of what?  It is a criminal
order, and you will have to have me subdued before it will be carried
out."

    As Jan listens to the drama unfolding on the bridge, he secures
the hood of his vacc suit and pressurizes it.  He quickly unholsters
his gauss pistol and moves towards the bridge, utilizing available
cover.  On the way, he hails Farouk over the ICS.

    "Mr. Farouk, I concur with your judgement that the Commander has
issued an illegal order.  As senior medical officer aboard I question
the fitness of Admiral Ger to command.  We are not in engaged in
combat, and the only threat applied to us has been removed.  Admiral,
I suggest you step back and consider your position."

    As Jan steps on to the bridge, he moves to cover Lazer\'s back and
lets Jett do the talking.

    Richard Jett has slowly walked towards the front of the bridge,
having stopped just behind Zben. He glances down at Zben\'s panel
configuration, briefly, then turns back to face Ger and Lazer without
a word, but gives Zben a small, encouraging pat on the shoulder.

    When Ger brusquely dismissed his concerns, Richard remained quiet,
but his countenance became more grave. The order to fire is somewhat a
shock, but Lazer\'s unconventional reaction snaps Richard back to the
crisis.

    He chooses to speak just after Lazer has finished, when the impact
of Lazer\'s actions has registered fully with the shuttle crew.

    His voice is firm and controlled, with a steely resolve lurking in
the background.

correct, if perhaps overly dramatic." An extremely tiny laugh. "...but
perhaps this is the season for that." His utterly serious visage turns
to consider Ger.  "You, sir, have come to a reckoning of sorts. You
may have a plan, you may have the most beneficial of motives, or you
may not. This is not a military expedition. This is a scientific
expedition funded by and for Turnskaad Industries, presumably
conforming to the appropriate laws. Your actions, on their face, seem
to conflict with your duty to Turnskaad. Mister Farouk correctly notes
that your action could be criminal. How are we to know differently?
Now, sir, an explanation is long overdue. Explain *now*."

    "Recognize the appearance of danger, Commander. None here are
robots, none pledged to unwavering obedience. Make your decision,
Count. If we err, show this to us. This is a matter of such import
that none can take lightly."  Jett is standing perfectly straight,
looking Ger square in the eye, wavering not in the least. His deadly
serious tone indicates that he is not speaking lightly.

The Bridge is silent, awaiting Ger\'s word....

suggested here in the past.  At a fuel consumption of .003kl/hr per kl
of TL9-TL12 fusion plant, I calculated that about 5MW maximum power could
be obtained at 100% fusion of the deuterium (which would be aneutronic, I
think...).  Given that 

a) 6MW per .003kl can be produced in larger (more efficient??) units and

b) I doubt that 100% efficient anything is going to exist (at least at the
lower TLs) and that the 5MW does not include any efficiency losses in 
conversion to useful energy

some other reaction must be taking place.  If we were really using D/T fusion
we would have the problem with radiation shielding that has been alluded to.
If we assume 4H -> 1HE at some incredibly inefficient reaction efficiency
(perhaps assisted by D reactions of some sort) then I think we get what we
see in the rules.  Metlay\'s remarks about D/T fusion in Traveller date back
to a previous trip through this topic, in which an HIWG position that ships
used 4H -> HE and fusion/plasma gun packs (below the minimum ship power plant
size) used D + T -> He + n was cited.

Steve asks:

>You give a TL8 LH rocket a specific impulse of about 428.  Why?  The
>SSME has a specific impulse of 450+.

The SSME has an Isp(vaccum) of about 454, though they\'re hoping to hit
460 by the late 1990\'s.  However, at sea level, that\'s closer to 390-400.
IMHO, without explaining the whole specific impulse variation with altitude
theory, the only reasonable way is to average and simplify.

Maybe I should state that thrust goes up 5 tons for all liquid rockets
operating purely in vaccum.  (this is off the top of my head... let me
analyze it a bit first 8-)  That should help correct things a bit.

I was presuming a really low-tech and low-heat resistojet.  I can\'t imagine
wanting to use one at a higher TL (well, ok, maybe, but the chart can\'t
get infinitely big 8-).  However, you have a point, which I\'ll explain in
a bit...

>Your fusion rocket (experimental) has an Isp of 51,400+.  Your TL9 version

Oops. 8-)  You\'re right, the specific impulse ought to go up a bit at TL9.
As for why did I set the values that low... well, I\'ve talked to several
people who do things like design theoretical fusion engines, and they
don\'t think that specific impulse of fusion rockets will get higher than
about that (50,000) for any near-term (i.e. one we can understand, if not
build, now) designs.  Those values of 1,000,000 were from physicists, not
engineers. 8-)

>And why are you using liquid Xenon and such for your ion drives, instead
>of cadmium, which has a density of 8.65?

Because last time I checked, the people working with testing ion drives
were having reliability problems with the ones that didn\'t use noble
gases.  I don\'t want to presume using something that may or may not
work.

>For that matter, why do you assign a density of 1.0 for rocks?  Very few

You need to stack round rocks in non round fuel hoppers, and more importantly,
rocks don\'t pack that well unless you make them into cubes or such.
If someone wants to complain about this, well, if you think you can pack them
in more, go right ahead 8-)

>Steve_Higginbotham@agwbbs.new-orleans.LA.US


Ok, now here\'s the one question that I\'ve been avoiding talking about:
"why didn\'t I do anything about putting Ion drives in?"

Well, there\'s a good reason for this.  In real ion and MPD drives, there
is a strong variation in specific impulse and thrust among the various
drive options.  More importantly, the specific impulse and thrust of a
particular engine type varies with sort of inversely... you can get
higher thrust at lower Isp and visa versa.  There are power supply weight
considerations that require a careful look at the MegaTraveller power
supply options before any reasonably accurate simulation can be done
in these rules.
	WHile mostly applying to the Ion and MPD engines, this also will
affect things like the resistojet, which could theoretically get a whole
lot hotter, the mass driver, etc.  I need to go back and re-read several
J.Propulsion and J.Spacecraft papers to take a look at how the tradeoffs
work in detail.  Until I\'ve done that, I am not willing to make a guess
as to how to accurately simulate these items in MegaTraveller... 8-)

Subject: \'a pirate could never catch you\'

Your assumptions first off assume that jump points are not used, and merchant
ships do not travel any predefined routes to anywhere else in the system.  IE
there is no place to just hang around and expect another ship to come near you.
Most systems have installations/settlements other then the main world, and
traffic going to and from them.

I\'m not sure on this, but I assume that with constant 1-6 G Maneuver, most
courses are pretty straight line, as opposed to current low cost spiral
courses.

Most merchants (at least the easy targets) have 1 or 2 G Maneuver.  Most
Pirates have 6 G Maneuver.  Most Pirates do have better then average sensors
and EMM.

Lastly, there are all kinds of possibilities for subterfuge:

 o  hang around the jump point and pretend to have a drive failure,
 o  maybe even ask your victims to come aboard and give you a hand.
 o  beam a distress call to your victim when they are within sensor range
    and the navy is not.
 o  pose as customs inspectors.
 o  pose as someone with a hot/lucretive cargo to unload.
 o  lie at a good intercept point powered down to escape detection.


other factors:

ships do not always have the fuel to jump, especially incoming.
ships do not always have jump calculations ready.

notice that the difficulties you list for pirates, also apply to your navy and
customs inspectors. :-)

"1)  It takes 3.5 hours to reach 100 diameters from a size 5 world, if you
do not decelerate to a stop (which makes very little sense, anyway)."

Using what G Maneuver?  Jumping from a relative stop is safer and easier in my
book...

"2)  From a point directly ahead of a target\'s course, it takes three hours
at three gees to match course and position within 1000Km."

I don\'t think directly ahead is the best intercept position, since you have to
hurry to get there, and hurry to catch up.  I\'m not sure, but I would think
that catching up from behind would be best.

"5)  A starship trying to match course like that is UNMISTAKABLY trying to
match course."

There is a lot to this point.  Who was it that said that no battle ever takes
place in space unless both sides want to fight?  This assumes equal ability,
though, and my pirates have a big advantage over merchants.

"Increase the effective sensor ranges by a factor of ten, too.  If you don\'t no
pirate will ever FIND a target out there in the deep dark."

Strange, your initial comment was that you can see a pirate coming from too far
away.  I would think decreasing sensor range would help as well.  Even better,
expand the range difference between an at rest pirate with advanced equipment
actively watching for a victim, and a short crewed merchant with basic
equipment in flight.

Yes, I\'ve read it.  I tend to dislike overuse of \'ancient artifacts\' as

Good point.  However, since the Imperium includes a lot of worlds with
atmospheres not like ours, performance levels for different atmospheric
densities are needed - especially since it can make a difference of 25% 
in your take-off mass.  I suggest a ten percent increase in vacuum, 5%
in thin atmosphere, -5% in dense atmosphere.  Apply it to ALL rocket-
type devices.

Keep in mind that a NERVA is a \'resistojet\' which heats hydrogen with a
nuclear plant.  And the number I gave you was for water heated by burning
paper.  Even a wood-burner could do better.  For that matter, last

You don\'t need to use round rocks.  Square ones can be fired from a mass-

done any technical reading on them since the early 80s.

Hi, gang. Some of you may know that I have one consuming passion that
ranks higher on my personal list than Traveller. (Well, TWO, but my
wife isn\'t a matter of public discussion. At least not today. |-> )
That passion is electronic music, a hobby I pursue vigorously on off
evenings between research trips and so on. My last album was released
at about the time I joined the TML, and has been out of print for
years, and my CD won\'t be out for another few months yet, album art
sessions having stalled due to time strictures on my part. (Anyone in
the Pittsburgh area who has a powerful workstation, a good art
program, and the ability to do camera-ready color separations,
interested in instant fame?) But in the meantime, I have just received
a copy in the mail of a project I\'d forgotten about, that is now
available to anyone curious as to what my music sounds like
(sometimes). 

It\'s called FACETS, and it is the first sampler album from Synkronos
Music, the indie label in Philadelphia for whom I do solo stuff. I\'d
describe the majority of the music on the album as, umm.... uh....

Well, I guess the usual term is "space music." Each piece is about 13
minutes long, and develops slowly, with some (but not a lot of) rhythm
and a structure that lends itself to thinking rather than dancing. You
could also call it "New Age on Angel-Dust." It\'s rather like the sort
of thing the Berlin school (Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze et alii) 
were doing in the 70s and early 80s. Not my usual cup of java, but I
don\'t sneeze at exposure to ANY listening public. There are six
artists featured on the tape, and the whole cassette is about 85
minutes long. The packaging and sound quality are terrific, and true
to form, I like every piece except mine. |->

If you\'d like a copy, they\'re $10 postpaid to anywhere in North
America, and you can Email me for details on how to get one. If you\'re
in Europe or elsewhere in the world and would like a copy, Let me know
and I\'ll get information on how much you\'ll have to add for air mail
shipping. The stuff I normally play is more chestburster music---- this
stuff is more facehugger sorts of things. I think anyone who plays
Traveller would get a kick out of this, but hey, it\'s your sawbuck.

Thanks for your time and consideration. BTW, the first line was a
joke; if you\'re seeing this, it\'s because James approved it and
transferred it to the TML from his own mailer.

Probably the latter would be the most profitable way to do "piracy".
I can\'t see a way to make piracy pay without the resources of a planetary
government to back you up.  And then only by doing a "space viking"
number:  raid planets, not ships.  Hit those out-of-the -way planets,
the ones with enough loot to pay expenses, but no defenses to speak of.
Moving targets are too much trouble.

A strategy a party I was in once used:

o Get hold of an old warship, and update it with the latest equipment,
  especially sensors and electronic masking.  It doesn\'t even matter if
  all of the weapons work, really.
o Power down the pirate ship, perhaps trailing behind an asteroid or
  something, then use low-power passive sensors to detect a passing
  merchant.
o Send out an obviously damaged lifeboat that really contains a disguised
  boarding party.
o When the lifeboat is picked up by the trader, cause enough commotion
  and damage to prevent the ship from entering jump/running away/etc.
  while the warship powers up and moves in close.  With luck, the trader
  has been occupied by the boarding party.  If not, hopefully they have
  done enough damage to make the ship an easy target.
o It also helps if you have a way of towing the trader away easily.
o And yes, one catch does set you up for a while.  We disassembled the
  ships and sold the parts.

We also tried posing as customs inspectors once.  It\'s rather risky,
though.  Posing as someone with stolen cargo is also rather risky,
since people who buy stolen goods tend to be more cautious.

Another thing to do is this: forget about traders -- go after miners.
You don\'t even care too much about the ore -- just take the ships.
Miners are easier targets, tend to go to the same places, and tend to
work alone.  You should be able to hide a powered-down ship in an
asteroid belt.  You can even put a warhead in the asteroid being
mined, and clean up after it goes off.

Hmmm...
Terra to Jupiter, 1G - 155.16 hours.
Same trip, 10 degree offset to straight course - 158.81 hours.
This course adds 2.4% to yuor travel time, and increases the area to be
searched by a pirate by a VAST amount.  Since pirate sensors can detect
things at about 500,000Km, just like the rest, then you\'d need 4500 ships
to cover the possible line of approach adequately.  And if you found the
target out there, you\'d require 11.3 hours to match velocity, by which 
time the merchant would again be lost to sensors (he\'d be about .5AU away
by then).  Assuming the target took no further evasive maneuvers, then
you\'d catch him within a day.  If he took the precaution of changing his
velocity by 10Km/s after he left sensor range, you\'d never find him.

Where do all these pirates get these multi-100-MCr ships?  You\'d think if
they wanted to get rich, they\'d sell their ship and retire, wouldn\'t you?

 After the first few times, no-one would come to rescue you.  They\'d all

 They are merchants on a tight schedule, there is a starport a million Km
 away.  They\'ll let you take care of yourself.

 And when is that?  If you are at a "jump point", then the Navy is always
 in range.

 It has merit.  But only if your ship is indistinguishable from a Customs
 ship.  Minor vagaries like your oversized power plant are sure to be 
 noticed.  And the first time a target gets away a message (which will be
 the first target, probably), then that game will no longer work.
 
> o  pose as someone with a hot/lucretive cargo to unload.
 
 Sounds illegal.  Sounds like CUstoms will KNOW you did something yoo
 shouldn\'t, if they see you meet another ship in space for cargo transfer.
 Sounds like an idea to avoid if you are a merchant.  Of course, if 
 your target is another pirate, HE might be intrigued by the possibilities.
 
> o  lie at a good intercept point powered down to escape detection.
 
The whole point of that post was that THERE ARE NO GOOD INTERCEPT POINTS.
 
 
>other factors:
 
>ships do not always have the fuel to jump, especially incoming.
 
Too true.  This is your BIG chance.  If the target pops out of jumpspace
real nearby.  If he pops out at 250 diameters, he\'ll be out of sensor
range until he has built up enough velocity to get to the planet before
you can match position and velocity.  And he\'ll only add 3 hours to a one
week voyage by doing so.
 
>ships do not always have jump calculations ready.
 
True.  But it only takes 8 minutes to get one at TL12, one minute at TL15.
 
 
>notice that the difficulties you list for pirates, also apply to your navy
and
>customs inspectors. :-)
 
Not really.  Customs people would just wait in orbit for you to stop.  
If you don\'t, then you are no concern of theirs.

one gravity.  It\'s not safer if a pirate will jump you if you stop.

have to

 From directly astern, same conditions - 3 hours.  From any side, 
slightly longer.  You would have to detect the target at a range of
1,000,000
Km, to do that, though.  Slightly beyond sensor range.  And this run would
be unmistakably an intercept,  after the first 1.4 hours of acceleration.
Which would give the target an extra half hour to prepare, and jump vectors
only take 8 minutes to compute.

No. 6Gs is not really much of an advantage over 1G.  Mostly they just make
an enormously valuable target for the merchant\'s weapons.  The limitation
on a pirate is that most targets only are in range for 1,000,000 Km or
less.
And that sensors only work over about half that range.
If I re-analyze what I did yesterday to use the actual sensor ranges from
MT,
I find that the pirate locates you 53 minutes before you jump (IF he
detects
you right at the fringe of sensor range - rolls a 12 on a cautious task,
with a model nine computer).  Unfortunately, a six gee pirate requires 101
minutes to match course.  Better luck next time, eh?  If the pirate is not 
directly ahead, he probably never gets a detection at all.  And if he does,
the time till jump will always be less than 53 minutes, and his transit
time will always be more than 101 minutes.
 
>Strange, your initial comment was that you can see a pirate coming from
too
>far away.  I would think decreasing sensor range would help as well.  
 
My original comment presupposed that the operating arena was the 100 
diameter limit.  In deep space, the picture changes.  And making the pirate
blind will hurt him far more than it would hurt the merchant.
 
>Even better, expand the range difference between an at rest pirate with 
>advanced equipment actively watching for a victim, and a short crewed 
>merchant with basic equipment in flight.
 
The best sensor suite in MT only costs 6% of the price of the cheapest
merchant.  It\'s a worthwhile investment.  As is a crew member to watch
those sensors while in flight.
And, again, where are the pirates getting the money for all this ship?
 
BTW, a 400T 6G pirate would not have enough cargo space to offload the 
cargo of a free trader, and could not carry enough crew to repair and
man one.  Assuming it used a mixed laser/missile armament, it would have
room for no more than 8 crew, and no cargo.  It would require six men for
it\'s own crew, and three (minimum) for the prize crew.  Which it can\'t 
carry.  Assuming the free trader still had functional drives after the
capture.

You don\'t have to use "artifacts" as such, just psionic messages.  And they
don\'t need to be very clear - in fact, they can not be very clear, or else
they spoil the adventure by making prophecies which must be fulfilled.
They can be clear on such things as "The expedition includes Imperial-type
humans who are doing something active", but not on what they are doing or
why.

> So why don\'t you have the Imperials mount their OWN core expeditions?

Because they would have to go through the Vargr, through the Zhodani, or
take a very long detour.

> travelers in Traveller.

Perhaps if someone can explain the concept of "co-operation" to the
Vargr, and probably invent a new word in several Vargr languages at
the same time?  :-)  Besides, you would have to negotiate with more
than one Vargr tribe, some of which would probably be hostile to
each other, never mind what they think of humans.  It might make a
good adventure for travellers acting under their own initiative, but
I doubt that any official expedition would be mounted on such terms.

DM: "A well-dressed noble comes to you and explains his plans for his
    own Core expedition through Vargr territory.  He is willing to fund
    the whole expedition, and pay you generously in addition.  All you
    need to provide is your ship, and yourselves as crew."

Player: "I ask him what he has been drinking or injecting himself with,
    and where I can get some.  Then I try to sell him Olav hault
    Plankwell\'s secret war diaries."

I thought the last of those was generally missing, which is why you are
adventuring in the first place!  As for the gauss pistol, and other high
tech stuff - you\'d better also include a good stock of spare parts, because
not many planets will be able to help you in the event of a breakdown.  I
would generally operate one or two TL\'s down from that, in order to have a
better chance of doing maintenance at short notice.  As for weapons, I tend
to prefer snub pistols and (where allowed) ACR\'s.  (Mind you, I\'m still
stuck with a mind based in Striker, where gauss pistols didn\'t have very
wonderful penetration, and where the slight penetration advantage of a
gauss rifle over an ACR was more than offset by the fact that it also
required higher DEX to use, and to get a bonus; and by the fact that even
on a TL 7 world, you could get slug ammo if you were really desparate.)

Most of your points are all too cogent, alas. Perhaps the only
way to save the pirates is to ignore logic. Nevertheless (and
in order to reduce the leap of faith as much as possible) I\'ll
answer a few of them.

No it isn\'t. You keep it turned low. Not completely powered
down, but down to the level of the cutter you\'re trying to
impersonate. Turning it up full power will not involve the time
it takes to cold-start.

It is if the chance of getting jumped by a pirate if you stop
is less than the chance of being wrecked if you don\'t.

You forget the transponder that a benevolent Imperium demands
that all ships use at all times  -  that in the official
Traveller Universe _cannot_ be switched off unless you tamper
illegally with the mechanism. A pirate can get a passive
pinpoint the moment the merchant leaves orbit. But even in a
universe where the authorities sensibly allows it\'s merchants
to switch off this electronic beacon, pirates could have spies
on the planet, ready and eager to tightbeam travel information
to their ship.

Well, it\'s unlikely to be a cutter you\'re impersonating, unless your
main ship is a starship which carries a cutter.  You do not want to
be tied to one system, or the navy will have a much easier time
finding you!  Now, if you can get your hands on an Imperial Type T
patrol cruiser, you would be in business.

So you do what commerce raiders did during WW2.  You approach using
your cover, and then signal the victim and tell him not to use his
radio, or you will leave the area in a hurry and leave him in a lot
of small pieces.  Your signal, of course, is tight beam and low power,
so that it will not be picked up by anyone else.

Besides, why would one signal prevent the same trick working later?
So the merchants now know that there is a Type T in pirate hands,
posing as an official Naval ship.  What are they going to do, ignore
all Type T cruisers that they see in future?

So you cut your manoeuvre drives just before you jump.  It is, of course,
not possible to make your ship stationary before you jump (stationary in
whose frame of reference?).

Another question which has been raised is jump points.  I assume that this
is an artificial concept, rather than a physical limitation - you can jump
from anywhere to anywhere (assuming that departure and destination are at
safe distances from their respective stars/planets), but the world\'s
government would prefer you to jump to and from a certain place.  This
increases the risk of collision, as one ship approaches preparing to jump
just as another ship exits jump space.  But you would probably not have a
jump "point", so much as a jump region.  This region would be a sphere of
radius 500,000km (the maximum range of sensors and weapons), with a warship
or two at the centre, and another one or two cruising along a line joining
the centre of the sphere to the planet.  The government would not forbid
jumping to somewhere outside this region, because if it can patrol outside
that region, then it is unnecessary to define the region in the first place.
But the government would be able to protect merchants who used that region,
and would make no attempt to help anyone who did not.

Another possibility would be to simply have a large space station at that
point, acting as a starport.  Thus, a ship could jump almost immediately
after launching, and could dock very soon after exiting jump space.  Or
would the use of jump drives near the station be likely to harm it?

Anyway, there are a few more points to chew on!

	Agent 604 settled into the chair comfortably, taking in the
setting of the office in a glance.  This company is an excellent
cover for a SORAG:  liquid hydrogen production and transport.
With hydrogen needed all over the planet, the company can get
into virtually every business, its fleet of tankers provide a
large group of inconspicuous vehicles, thus necessitating a large
communications network that we can use for more than just getting
people their fuel.
	Colonel Korispatl sat pensively across a large desk from
604.  "604, you know about some of the shakeup SORAG went through
recently, you may not know the cause, but I am going to give you
as much as you need to know for your assignment."
	"Colonel Baremkatlasche\' was found to be a mole."  Korispatl
let it sink in:  the head of SORAG in the Ikar sector:  a mole.
"We do not know who he was working for, but he was passing
information to someone, and two months ago he defected.  We do
not know how many others may have been involved in the sellout,
but we have some suspects."
	"Why, to put it bluntly, are they not dead?" asked 604.
	"For one, we do not know who they work for.  Two, they are
Just suspects at the moment.  Three, there are rather a lot of
them, should they all disappear it would not look too good for
us.  And finally, it would be rather messy.
	Your assignment is to observe one of them:  Dr. Mako
Malenkoviepr.  Watch him, report on his moves, and try to
determine wither or not he has sold out."
	"I have heard of Dr. Malenkoviepr, archeologist, something
of a folk hero, why is he on the suspect list?"
	"Twenty three years ago, he found an ancient base while
working for us.  His superior at the time was Baremkatlasche\'. It
seems that there actually were ancient Droyne warriors in
suspension there.  When they revived, they insisted on committing
krintrinasoyu.  Malenkoviepr is the regional expert on the
Droyne, it was his job to talk them out of it.  He failed to do
so, and we lost the chance to examine an almost perfectly intact
ancient base."
	"And you think he just let them do it?"
	"Well, actually I was there, and in a matter of speaking yes
he did just let them do it, but there are other factors to
consider.  Malenkoviepr was brought up in Droyne society, to him
their ritual suicide was the proper thing for them to do, and
interfering with that would rob them of honor."
	604 considered it, "That would indicate he has more loyalty
to the Droyne than the Consulate."
	"Possibly, but it was a tough spot he was in, I would not
really judge him from that one incident.  Still it was enough to
get him thrown out of SORAG.  Nowadays, he does a great deal of
travelling outside the Consulate as part of general good will
tours.  This makes him even more suspect."
	"Why do you not just pull him in, interrogate him and read
his mind?"
	"We may yet.  But, he is trained to resist, and he is a
telepath of considerable strength.  It would be a difficult task,
though we have the capability to do it.  Observation might be
more of a risk, but we may get more information than he might
hold right now."
	"How shall I observe?"
	"Dr. Malenkoviepr has obtained a courier:  the Kliemoshie.
He will be needing a crew.  You will sign up.  Now, we have been
contacted by the Ine Givar organization which has asked for his
help in raiding an Imperial archeological expedition on Enoc.
You and the other crew will be provided with battle dress and
gauss rifles and training to use them by the Ine Givar on
Aramat."
	"Right, I will want a list of the other suspects to see if
there is any connections between him and any others."
	"Agreed, and, I can tell you that there is one other suspect
that we know Malenkoviepr has dealings with."
	"And that is?"
	"Me."
	"You are a suspect?"
	"Yes, however, I would not bother investigating me, if I
were you.  Undoubtedly some one else has that little chore.  But,
if you feel the need, by all means go ahead."
	"I see."
	"Ahh, you are suspicious.  Good, this may be tricky
business, we need a suspicious person on it.
	Now on less touchy areas, since you will be traveling
outside the Consulate, I would also like you to report on any
pirate activity you find.  It has been on a sharp increase in the
Ikar sector of late.  And there may have been some connection
between Colonel Baremkatlasche\' and the pirates.
	You see about five months ago SORAG captured an Imperial
Transport:  the Star Rider.  She was being given to the League of
Suns as a gift from the emperor.  We captured the ship and made
it appear as though she crashed."
	"Yes, I remember.  Star Rider:  experimental transport, tech
level fourteen, considered obsolete, meson spinal mount, forty
thousand tons.  Presumed destroyed in a collision with a free
trader."
	"The trader was taking an assault team to the ship.  They
rendezvoused and the team took the ship.  Soon afterward, the
ship was ambushed by pirates.  Some one leaked the plan:  Colonel
Baremkatlasche\'s plan.  The ship has since been sighted in pirate
service.  Of course, only we know what ship is out there.
Officially, we have been dismissing sightings of the Star Rider,
but we want to find that ship and whoever is operating it."
	"Any leads on the pirates?  A forty thousand ton ship is a
pretty large ship for a gang of pirates to be running."
	"Yes, and what is more, the ship was almost completely
stripped of armament.  It needed a major overhaul and weapons to
put the teeth back in it, and that appears to have been done.
Almost any interplanetary state could have done the work.
Several independent planets could have done it as well."
	"That is a lot of territory to cover."
	"There is one thing notable about their attacks:  the object
seems to be the capture of ships rather than cargo."
	"How do you know?"
	"They are less discriminatory about the victims cargoes than
other pirates, they have even dumped cargoes in space."
	"I see."
	"Now you know all you need for now."  Korispatl handed 604 a
holo crystal, "Here is Dr. Malenkoviepr\'s file, familiarize
yourself with it.  Here also is Baremkatlasche\'s file, in it is
the list of the other suspects.  If you wish their files, you may
draw them from records.  Good Luck."
	604 dropped the crystal in a terminal slot and a holographic
image sprang into existence.  A tiny doll of Dr. Malenkoviepr
stood on the desk along with a readout:

	Now, that kid seemed awfully nervous in his interview.  That

	A breath of wind crossed the landing pad giving the only
break in the heat of the desert that was Aramat.  Four Grav tanks
hovering above the pad gave the only shade where a group of
beings reclined.
	The crew observed from the bridge of the Kliemoshie.
	"What kind of tanks are those?" asked Miakr of no one in
particular.
	Dr. Malenkoviepr waited for an answer, but none seemed to be
forthcoming from the crew members.  "They are tech level eleven
Gram class Grav tanks:  crew of four armed with a 10 megawatt
plasma gun and a 30 mm autocannon.  If you did not know them, get
to know them.  They are pretty battle worn by the look of them,
the third one has a damaged grav module, see how it is listing?"
	In the shade of the tanks a group was resting seeming
unconcerned about the arrival of the Kliemoshie.  "Well, shall we
go meet whoever we are supposed to meet, and find out what it is
we are supposed to be doing?" suggested Jietlshaiepr.
	"Right, everyone armed.  Jietlshaiepr put on that battle
dress.  Drert, you are the gunner, lend your gauss rifle to Shtam
and get in the ship\'s turret.  Niedrsha, take your submachine
gun.  Miakr, break a shotgun out of the locker and bring Vole."
as he spoke Dr. Malenkoviepr brought out a large strange looking
gauss pistol and began adjusting it.  A shoulder stock was added
with a barrel extension for good measure with a laser designator
put on top for a finishing touch of deadliness.

	The scent of law level zero cigarettes was borne on what
little breeze there was on the desert planet along with the sound
of a lazy tune that was distinguishably Vargr.  The musical
intervals were a bit too precise to be sung by a human, while the
words, to the untrained ear were growls and barks.  It seemed to
be telling of some vargr who was in some way particularly
charismatic in some particular way.
	Miakr stood closely by the doctor holding the shotgun at the
ready, and looking a bit awkward with the unfamiliar weapon.
	Dr. Malenkoviepr spoke first in Gevueg.  "Good afternoon, I
understand we are expected."
	A large male vargr squinted out of the shade of the grav
tanks, "Graaah!" he shooed a young female off his lap and stood.
He paused for a moment in thought, grasped Dr. Malenkoviepr
warmly by the hand and said in strongly accented Zhodani "Good
bye!"
	He turned and greeted the each of the crew with a hearty
handshake, a breath of alcohol, and a badly pronounced "Good
bye!"  "My is brain..." he paused, looked at the confused
expressions of the new arrivals and asked "Do you speak English?
I think will we along get a easier if we do, my Zhodani is very
bad."
	Dr. Malenkoviepr nodded agreeably.
	"Name\'s Oddball." he declared in English.  "Least all
my friends call me Oddball, and you\'re all my friends."  He put
his arm around the doctor\'s shoulder to emphasize the point.
Malenkoviepr looked at the arm with disdain.  Seeming to ignore
this the vargr withdrew his arm.
	"I am Doctor Malenkoviepr and this is my crew, medical
officer Dr. Jietlshaiepr, pilot Niedrsha, engineer Shtam, my
steward Miakr and his robot Vole."
	Suddenly the crew saw objects flying toward them, they
recognized them for bottles as they came down for them to catch.
Oddball looked like a juggler losing every juggling pin he had as
he tossed the bottles to them.  "Zilan Neuwine, not bad."
observed Jietlshaiepr.  The law level zero cigarettes were
refused.
	"You have the equipment for us?" asked Dr. Malenkoviepr
attempting to get down to business.
	"Yup, six suits of zho battle dress, six zho gauss rifles,
ammo, plus one instructor:  your\'s truly dat\'s me."  Oddball threw
a canvass off of a pile of crates of armor and one of rifles.  "I
already modified one of the suits to yer height and weight specs
as supplied by the Ine Givar."
	"Ine Givar, that would be the anti-Imperial, pro-psionic
terrorists." asked Niedrsha.
	"Yup, dat\'s who\'s payin\' da bills.  But enough business,
let\'s get down to serious matters."  He brought out his own
bottle of wine, "To your continued health my good humans."
	The female vargr who had been seated on Oddball\'s lap came
over and draped herself around Miakr\'s neck who was already
having difficulty balancing a shotgun and two bottles of wine.
"My name\'s Gresha what\'s yours?"  Miakr suddenly felt a sting in
his arm, and looked to see Jietlshaiepr withdrawing a hypodermic
needle from it.  "Watch out for the teeth." She said in Zhodani
over her shoulder as she left him with Gresha.
	An Axly member of the tank crew approached Niedrsha, but she
found herself interrupted by the point of a plasma gun held
casually but deliberately by the menacing form of Jietlshaiepr in
full battle dress.  She continued on and stopped before Shtam.
Shtam smiled politely but directed his attention elsewhere.  The
four armed Axly are humanoid but not sufficiently so for him.
She returned to a male of her own species.
	Dr. Malenkoviepr saw the situation rapidly deteriorating.
He turned and addressed Oddball, "We will begin outfitting and
training with the armor and rifles tomorrow I trust."
	"Oh yeah, no problem.  But fer now relax, enjoy.  Now allow

Perhaps Traveller Sensors should be like submarine sonar.  When you\'re
moving you\'re blind because you\'re making too much noise.  For
something like a neutrino detector this even sounds plausible.  Maximum
sensitivity comes from turning off your own plant.  The more power you
generate, the harder it is to detect other people\'s power plants.  When
you get close enough and have a bearing on a target you can switch to
optics, and when you get real close you can switch to something like
radar or laser-ranging.  Likewise the less power you\'re using the
harder you are to see on N-detectors.

Warfleets would have scout boats ahead doing bounding overwatch with
some moving while others coast on low power looking for unexpected
power sources, but a merchant can\'t afford to do that; it\'s pick up a
cargo and boost for jump because time is money.

I think the other thing that would aid pirates is reducing weapon
range, so that 12 warships in a dodecahedron around a planet can\'t
cover the entire volume to 100 meters without needing to move.

That makes a minute amount of sense.  But since pirates will have bigger
power plants, they will have larger signatures.  So once they start to 
move to intercept, they lose you on their sensors, and you pick them up
on yours.  Then you change course and let them go on their merry way.
I should point out that ACTIVE sonar is not really affected by submarine 
speed.  So radar would work just fine.  And the merchants don\'t mind using
radar, since they have nothing to hide.  The pirates can\'t use it because
they DO have something to hide.  Remember ESM.

No, warfleets won\'t.  They\'ll use drones to scout ahead, and the fleet will
accelerate normally.
And time may be money, but an extra three hours per week is trivial.  And
that\'s how much longer it would take.  Keep in mind all you have to do is
stop accelerating for a few minutes, look around, then accelerate again.
Warm start of a fusion plant only takes 3 or 4 minutes.  If you sacrifice
that much time every 15 minutes, you still take only 256 minutes to transit
to jump distance, as opposed  to 211 minutes of continuous boost.  I doubt
any merchant will get excited about losing 1.5 hours every two weeks.

NO!  That was the whole point of some of those posts.  If weapon ranges
are reduced, then the pirate will have a HARDER time of intercepting
targets in the 3 or 4 hour window he has between boost and jump.

The top speed of a fighter is set by any of several considerations.
Simply running out of power is only one possibility.  The reason the
F-16 is limited to about Mach 2 maximum is that efficient engine
operation at higher speeds requires variable geometry in the air intakes,
omitted on the F-16 because it costs weight, money, and reliability.
Another common limitation is overheating in some area -- the canopy,
the nose structure, or the engine, for example.  Heating starts to
become troublesome shortly after Mach 2, and beyond about Mach 2.5
you need drastic measures like wholesale use of titanium.

With good aerodynamics and variable intakes, the T:W ratio doesn\'t need
to be all that high to run you up against thermal limits.  The F-106
set a world absolute speed record at circa Mach 2.5, and several other
fighters of that vintage routinely hit temperature limits in that
vicinity while still accelerating fiercely.  If memory serves, even the
SR-71\'s T:W ratio is nowhere near the F-16\'s.

I\'ve come to the conclusion that the problem with the pattern of decline
described in _Hard Times_ is that it assumes that, before the Rebellion,
all worlds are, for all practical purposes, possessed of high
stellar technology.

Take, for example, the chapter opening in which the seasoned traveller
describes his amazement in encountering an electric arc-welder.  While
the use of one would be surprising on a world formerly capable of
x-ray laser welders would be surprising, it seems unlikely that someone
who has travelled widely in Imperial space would never have seen one
before, given the large number of industrial and pre-stellar worlds.

According to _Hard Times_, as worlds are cut off from interstellar
trade, they become unable to sustain their prior levels of technology,
and must regress to lower, locally sustainable levels of technology.

Now, I had always assumed that the reason for the incredibly wide range
of levels of technology was that most worlds preferred to remain at
levels of technology which were locally sustainable.

_Hard Times_ seems intended to cut down on the number of high-tech
worlds, and to increase the number of low-tech worlds.  But, I had rather
felt that there was already a superabundance of low-tech worlds.

I hope I am not annoying anyone by initiating another round of _Hard_
_Times_ bashing, but most prior discussion has focused on the idea that
technology could be quickly reacquired, rather than on the question
of why technology would be lost in the first place.

It certainly is.  I think Traveller looked at AFVs, and tried to generalize
to flying thingies.  The F-15 and SR-71 demonstrated that back when they
first stuck their feet in hteir mouths over at GDW.
 
Do you have any good (simple) solutions to the problem?  Create a drag
index for ALL vehicles, not just aircraft?

I had assumed that too.  Cynthia and I are working toward a redefinition 
ot Tech Level that would incorporate the effects shown in Hard Times, and
the original definition of TL, and the definition given in HT (none of
which
agree to any apreciable degree).
So far, we have decided to redefine TL as an ECONOMIC indicator, in line 
with TCS/Striker.  Then actual Technological level is defined by two sets
of TL breakdowns from WBH - one to indicate production TLs, the other to
indicate TLs USED.  
So a world might have a TL of 7, indicating a weak economy, with few
exports.
It\'s production TL might then be: 96-858B6-9890-A8-B, and it\'s Use TL might
be: B7-AAAD6-AAAB-CC-F.  The Use TL would be the one adversely affected by
HT, with the collapse tending toward the Production TL (with a chance of 
dropping below that, in case of bombardment, or other destruction of local
industry).  The economic TL could vary wildly during HT, as this world
might
export more, import more, import less, export less, whatever.

SO had I.  However, the system outlined above can explain those low TL
holes
as places with few exports to the Imperium at large.  The system above 
developed out of several discussions about how TL could be lost, when it is
defined as production capability.

By a curious coincidence, Cynthia and I were discussing that very subject
just last night.  Our solution was somewhat more complex than Scott\'s, but
possibly more consistent with MT\'s (admittedly maimed) rules regarding
computers and controls:
 
1)  A computer can control as many control points as it\'s (Max Input) times
it\'s CP Multiplier.  It can accept an input equal to it\'s Max Input.
 
2)  Computers can operate in series by connecting the output of a computer
into the inputs of other computers, to the limit of the Max Input of the
subordinate computers.  Thus, a computer can drive a number of subordinate
machines equal in number to it\'s CP multiplier.
 
3)  For control purposes, any size machine may be built up from smaller
machines using the above guidelines, and so any size ship may be built at
any TL, with a penalty due to the increased size/cost of the computers.
 
For instance, a model-10 computer can be built up from 50,000,002 model-0
computers, at a cost of MCr3,000,000.12, taking up 25,000,001 Kl (1,851,852
displacement tons).  Anyone need a TL5 supercomputer?  Codename Merlin,
perhaps?  A simpler example is a TL7 substitute for a model-5:  
 
     Model-5 output = 100,000 x 35 = 3,500,000
     model-2(TL7) output = 10,000 x 15 = 150,000.
     so, 24 model-2s would provide sufficient computing power, with two
     more to control those twenty-four (since the model-2 has a CP
Multiplier
     of 15, two are required to control more than 15 subordinate machines),
     and a single machine to control the two machines and link the whole
     setup into a single computer.  The final machine consists of 27
model-2
     computers, at a cost of MCr51.3 (compared to MCr9.7 for a M-5), and
     taking up 94.5 Kl (compared to 6.5Kl for a M-5).
 
In general, the computers produced are larger than their high-tech
analogues,
but they do sometimes work out cheaper, for those who like to really 
squeeze every last credit before letting go.

Both this solution and Scotts don\'t really mesh very well with a tiny detail
from the class Book 8 where massively parallel machines are allocated TL=8.

Once they become available, adding extra machines isn\'t going to improve
performance all that much (because you already have thousands of them).

The limits could be imposed by the software methodologies present at the
given TL rather than the hardware being pushed to the limit.  i.e. If building
large parallel machines were simply a matter of throwing lots of $$$$s and
silicon at the problem then we\'d have them already (and my PhD would not be
worth finishing :-).

Novas tend to be "relatively" small explosions that don\'t catastrophically
effect the star\'s overall structure.  Most nova occur in binary systems
where one star is filling its Roche Lobes (an equal gravitational potential
surface) and spilling surface material (mostly hydrogen) onto its companion
star.  As the material "falls" on the surface of the other star (if all
conditions are right) it can accumulate an significant amount and form a
local "hot spot".  When the temperature of the hot spot reaches a critical
temperature needed for fusion, the hydrogen "explodes" making a pretty
little flash in the dark.  There are binary systems that are believed to
be re-occuring nova stars meaning they go through this cycle over and over
again.

Super Nova tend to be much more exciting and usually result in massive and
catastrophic changes in the stucture of the star (such as expelling all
of the atmosphere and leaving a Neutron Star or Black Hole in wake).

In my personal opinion (which of course is always right :-) ), there is no
way any tech level would be sufficient to produce a nova let alone a super
nova.  Why?  A super nova is such a radical event, you would need to 
actually alter the gravitational field within the star (stars are typically
quite large) sufficiently to make it unstable in a way that it can only
compensate for by exploding (star are *quite* good are restoring their
stability).  Novas would be a more suitable candidate for artifical induction.
All you would have to do is create a local hot spot, which might be possible
with artificial gravity tech (this would be a lot easier than trying to 
alter the gravitational field of the entire star).  Again you have the
problem that the star will try to adjust rather than explode.  There is
no way to accumulate, heat, and deposit enough material on the surface to
cause a nova to occur more "naturally" (we\'re talking huge amounts of
materials, huge).  In either case, if you could effect the star properly
and in sufficient proportions, the resulting explosion could still take
a significant amount of time to manifest itself.

So in my opinion, its a virtual impossibility.  Long before you reach a
technology capable of destroying a star (if ever) you would *easily* be
able to destroy planets so any effect hoped to be gained by the stars
destruction could be achieved through the planet\'s destruction (which
would be a lot easier).

Disclaimers:  This is of course a simplified explanation.  It was taken
strictly from memory and while end stage stellar evolution was my specialty
in grad school it has been a LOOOONG time.

We\'ve always used jump-drives; if you jump while close enough to a star,
with a large enough ship, that star will go nova. (You\'ll also instantly
vaporize; this is a kamikaze weapon!) I don\'t remember where we got the
idea. I\'ve also seen it referenced in a Star Trek context: when travelling in
warp-space you still have to avoid stars that are in real-space, otherwise
they go nova.

This is one of the reasons why most planetary defense fleets don\'t let
jump-capable ships anywhere near the primary; going too far in-system is
grounds for instant destruction...

	Next morning Malenkoviepr dragged them all out early to
begin training.  Drert was pretty groggy, but Miakr was by far in
the worst shape.
	The battle dress was amazing.  Tech fifteen Zhodani battle
dress Noble-Guard model.  The Zhodani consulate is primarily tech
level fourteen.  What little there is above that is very rare.
In addition, the suits had all the extra features:  grav pack,
near-miss indicator, light intensifier, external sensors, shock
absorbing joints, magnetic soles and palms, chameleon blending,
IR absorbing ablative capes, multi-channel radio and laser
communicators, psionic shielding the works!
	"These suits were probably issued to a top elite psionic
guards platoon or something." thought Jietlshaiepr, "Where did
mercs get hold of stuff like this?"
			- V -
	The Ine Givar arrived three weeks into their training.  A
cutter from the Broadsword came down in the afternoon.  Soon
thereafter a tall lone figure stood at the top of a hill watching
the exercises of the crew with a keen blue stare.  A human almost
two meters tall.  Blonde hair, caucasian wearing a well worn flack
suit.  The jacket was covered with emblems taken from other
uniforms:  one could see Imperial insignia, League of Suns emblems,
Easmolian Confederation symbols, Sword Worlds, Darrian, Dynchian,
and others recognizable and not.  His worn facee looked anywhere
from thirty to three hundred years old.  The sub-machine gun he
on his arm looked like he had carried it that long:  it was well
worn, and was moved as though it was part of his arm.  His stony
face was expressionless with whitened scars crossing the skin.  One
white scar wrapped jaggedly all the way around his neck.
	But, he wore a psi-shield helmet.
	Malenkoviepr studied him for a moment as he surveyed the
small group of Zhodani\'s exercising in their battle dress under
the tactical direction of Jietlshaiepr.  "Why would a pro-psionic
terrorist need a psi-shield helmet?" he wondered.
	The doctor shouldered his rifle and flew over to the
tombstone figure.  "I am Doctor Mako Malenkoviepr."
	The man nodded but barely glanced at him.  His eyes swept
slowly from side to side followed by to muzzle of the submachine
gun.  The voice that grumbled from his scarred throat was devoid of
any feeling, the voice of a killer, "Name\'s Roland:  Roland T. Gunner."
	Mako eyed him and spoke without any tone. "You are wearing a
psi-helmet, remove it."
	"I don\'t believe that will be necessary."
	"I understand the need for security, but you have nothing to
fear."
	"You will be told what you need to know."
	"We can afford to be more open."
	"I don\'t believe it\'s necessary."
	"Then, I can not trust you."
	"I can live without your trust, and you already have been
paid, quite well too:  seven suits of battle dress and gauss
rifles."
	The Doctor thought a moment, "What about compensation for
anyone killed?  I do not want to have some one die, and have no
compensation for their kin."
	"What do you want?"
	"100,000 credits for each crewman killed deposited in a
trust where we can get it after the action."
	"Deposited where?  There\'s not a bank within a parsec of
here."
	"Then give me half that for each member of my crew.  We
will settle any outstanding balance at the conclusion of the
operation."
	Roland thought for a moment, "Very well.  How is your
training proceeding?"
	"Adequately."
	"I\'m here to make sure, we have invested a great deal of
money into this and I do not want to see it wasted."
			- VI -
	That night the assault was planned, Dr. Malenkoviepr, the
crew, Oddball, and the ominous Roland hovered over a map of the
archeological digs and guards.
	"Here ya got da camp of da troops and da digs." said
Oddball, "Now, da guards to me look to be marines, Imperial,
decked out at tech level fourteen."
	Niedrsha swallowed, "Imperial Marines?  *We* are taking on
Imperial MARINES?"
	"Yup."  Oddball looked to Roland for confirmation, but got
no response.  "Grrracht, dis monkey\'s a weird one." he thought.
	Jietlshaiepr whispered to her lover softly, "Maybe now
you\'ll take this training a bit more seriously?"
	Niedrsha nodded, "Fuck yeah..."
	"Good, I didn\'t really want to have to withdraw all sexual
favors." she whispered, then said aloud.  "I hope you all take
this very seriously.  I\'m lazy, and if there is one thing I hate
to do it\'s triage.  And field surgery is a Real bore, I just
might not bother."
	"Now," said Oddball, bringing up a small bottle of pills,
"For orbital bombardment headaches we have dese.  Dey\'re short
range radio transmitters.  Put dese on what ya want hit foist an\'
hardest.  Dey\'re part of a triangulating system, da short range
transmitters send a signal to a couple o\' long range ones dat
triangulate on da target an\' send up a signal to da gunners.
You\'ll need to place da long range transmitters as well, one
hundred meters from da camp in a right angle wit da bivouac right
in da center.  Cause we don\'t want to have to deal wit any nasty
lil\' tings like Tech fourteen grav tanks wit nasty little marines
in \'em."
	"Our priority targets," he continued, "are dere HQ,
barracks, an\' motor pool.  Any vehicles and so on, youse figure
out what ya don\'t want to have to fight yourselves.  Of course,
we\'ll be in dere right after da bombing stops so ya won\'t get
lonely.  But when we do get dere, we don\'t want to find da marines
in any good hiding places, like da places da Ine Givar want a look
at without plasma holes in em."  Oddball proceeded with a
flamboyant gesture, drawing himself to his full height and
putting his hand on his chest.  "So I\'d say ya all hole up in da
digs which is actually a dome o\' some kind, keep \'em out until da
cavalry arrives ta save da day.  Got any objections?"
	"Sounds good to me, but how do we get into the dome before
the shooting starts?" asked Shtam.  "I think the marines might
have something to say if we try to get into the dome while
wearing battle dress and toting gauss rifles."
	"We could smuggle the stuff inside, and then go in and suit
up just before the raid." suggested Miakr.
	"Yeah," said Shtam, "and hope that nobody comes in and
interrupts us.  Not to mention the guards that will probably
escort us in.   Imperial marines are not exactly the trusting
types when it comes to Zhodani."
	"I could take out one guard psionically.  But it will drain
most of my strength."  Dr. Malenkoviepr pointed out.
	"Leaving us with N minus one marines to face." observed
Niedrsha.
	"We don\'t all have to just walk in unarmed." said
Jietlshaiepr.
	"What do you mean?" asked Miakr.
	"I could teleport in fully armed once you are ready to jump
them."
	"Good call, that sounds like a good tentative plan.  We can
try it and improve on it in our training." said Malenkoviepr.
"Give us three days on the surface before you start bombing them,
that ought to be enough time to prepare for the show."
	"Party time!" laughed Drert slapping Niedrsha on the
shoulder.
	"Ahem, yes." coughed Malenkoviepr.  "What time would be best
for the attack?"
	"Night." said Niedrsha and Miakr in chorus.
	"Well dere\'s a problem dere." interrupted Oddball.
"Our equipment\'s only tech \'leven, deres is fourteen.  Our
infrared detectors are gonna be at a disadvantage at night.  And
I tink dat it\'s to our mootual advantage dat dere aie\'nt no
survivors?"
	"You want us to attack in full daylight?" asked Shtam
incredulously.
	Roland spoke, "Smuggle your gear into the dome as
archeological equipment.  Next day, go in just before dawn.  Jump
the guards and have the teleporter standing guard with the plasma
gun while you suit up for the attack.  Keep them from holing up
in the dome, we want to examine what we can without having to
blow up some impie standing next to it."
	The group suddenly all looked at Roland.  "Ok... Sounds
good."  said Malenkoviepr.  "There is an archeological expedition
from the League of Suns there now, two days after we arrive, they
will leave and then five days after that the main Imperial
investigators will arrive."
	"And they\'ll find a smoking hole in the ground." said Roland
with finality.
	"Give us three days on the surface and attack on the morning
of the fourth day at 0700 hours."
	"Make dat 0657 hours, I hate even numbers." said Oddball.
			- VII -
	The bell on Dr. Malenkoviepr\'s stateroom rang:  Miakr with
his evening glass of wine, late again.  The young steward came in
rather nervously.  Malenkoviepr thought only for a moment, he
didn\'t have to use telepathy to know what was on Miakr\'s mind,
Miakr was quite set on the raid, it was something else.
	"Uhh sir?"
	"Yes,"
	"I was wondering..." Miakr trailed off helplessly.
	"You were wondering if we need any more crew members,
specifically that sweet young vargr you have been spending so
much time with that you consistently bring my food late."
	Miakr laughed nervously, then looked crestfallen.  "Uhh,
yes."
	"Well, what are her qualifications other than the ones she
has been sharing with you."
	"Oh!  Well, she\'s trained as a commando and a gunner and
pilot an... Oh, here\'s her resume."

Commando First Lieutenant Gresha
9A8B86 Age 22
Race:  Vargr
Sex:  Female
Equipment qualified on:
Small spacecraft, Grav vehicles, Computers
Weapons qualified on:
Battle dress, Turret weapons, High energy weapons, Combat rifles, Grenade
launchers, Heavy weapons, Explosives
Experienced in hand to hand combat
Skilled in reconnaissance and survival-1

	"Well... she is quite the feisty one is she not?  But we
already have a gunner, and there is only one turret."
	"She\'s got a lot of skill at oh... lot\'s of things." managed
Miakr.
	"Yes, I am sure she has, though I would see Jietlshaiepr
about those scratches if I were you.  We can not afford to let
you get sick at the moment."
	Miakr pulled at his collar, at least the rest didn\'t show.
	"Well, we might just get into a few scrapes where we could
use her. You never know.  I take it I have to supply her with
weapons and equipment?"
	"Oh no, sir.  She\'s got her own stuff, and we may get more
from this raid."
	"Very well, have Jietlshaiepr give her a physical, at the
conclusion of the operation she can come with us.  But be warned,
I may just have her for my steward if she proves to know more
about it than you do."
	Miakr sighed heavily.  "Thank you, Doctor."
	"Now where are we going to put another crew member?  My lab
equipment is set up in the free staterooms, she may have to share
your\'s."
	"YES, Sir."
	"Hmm." thought Malenkoviepr, "I think I made him very happy.
Still, you would think it was his first affair."
			- VIII -
	Niedrsha sat back it the pilot\'s couch as he finished up the
checklist.  "Damn, It\'s good to get off this hotbox!  I\'d just
about had it sweating out there in battle dress with simulated
various power and system breakdowns, mostly the air
conditioning."
	"Do you think I liked it?  You really stink after a day\'s
exercises."  Jietlshaiepr wrinkled her nose.
	"Well, Jiet, you seemed to enjoy ordering everyone around."
	"It\'s not my fault my lessons were different from yours, and
it\'s good to know a little bit about tactics.  It just may end up
saving your ass, Niedrsha.  You weren\'t very conscientious about
your lessons."
	"A gauss rifle is almost accurate enough to point itself,
you said so yourself.  With a burst you can hit a target blind."
	"And suppose you don\'t have enough ammunition for one?
Single shots need to count sometimes.  I\'m going to keep you
alive if I have to kill you to do it.  And if you make me perform
surgery on you, I\'ll put you back together just to take you
apart, piece by piece... slowly."
	"Without Anesthetic?"
	"Damn Right."
	"Oh baby!  Yeah."
	"Shut up.  Let\'s lift gravs and haul mass."
	"Right-O."  Niedrsha leaned forward and hit the intercom,
"Attention, stand by for liftoff, please bring your seat backs to
an upright position and extinguish all smoking materials."
	A voice came over the intercom, "Niedrsha, in our departure
can you bring us within observation range of the Ine Givar Vessel
still in orbit?"
	"Yes, Doctor.  It might make them a bit edgy, we\'d have to
come within fifty kilometers to get in visual range."
	"Set course for that ship.  I should like to know just what
we are dealing with."
	"Doctor, this is Jietlshaiepr, from the sensor data, I read
it out at just over one thousand tons.  Tough to get an ID through the
atmosphere though, not without going active."
	"Then our tiny ship ought not to disturb them too much.
Niedrsha, set the course but do not chase them.  If they move out
of our way we will not push them."
			- IX -
	"Closing on the Ine Givar ship, range 40,000 Kilometers."
Jietlshaiepr studied the instruments, "They\'ve locked their active EMS
on us quite strong now."
	"What sort of information are we getting." asked
Malenkoviepr.
	Jietlshaiepr read off "Neutrino detector says she\'s
producing 21.875 Gigawatts in her reactor.  Accurate displacement
is:  one thousand, two hundred and fifty tons.  Configuration:
streamlined, cone... flattened cone.  Identification..."
She quickly punched up the information.
	Malenkoviepr thought, "Sounds like a Kinunir class battle
cruiser."
	"On the nose." Jietlshaiepr read it off, "Kinunir class

    'file' => 'TML1992/BN311320.TXT',
    'body' => '    The Problem: 
 
     (1) the Megatraveller starship design sequence depicts sensors as
being the size of a briefcase, completely ignoring the physics that require
a certain effective collector size for a given sensitivity.  (yes, I know
that there are ways of cheating, such as using 2 radiotelescopes 8,000
miles apart as if they were one 8,000  mile wide dish, but a starship\'s
sensors are limited to an effective size of the width of the ship, and they
still  must have collectors of a certain minimum size.) 
 
     (2) Under the present rules, there is no reason for the cheapest
tramp freighter NOT to mount as good a sensor suite as the Imperial Navy\'s
newest 500,000 ton battlewagon.  There are no tradeoffs.  (And the
merchants can detect the pirates before the pirates can "get" them ;-) !)
 
Our Solution:
 
   Make MegaTraveller sensors more like the ones in the real world, or at
least like the ones in 2300AD -- they require a certain amount of hull area
to mount collectors/arrays on.  We are using the following modifications to
starship construction involving sensors: 
 
     1. Sensors require Sensor Arrays to collect signals; the more
     sensitive the sensor is to be, the larger the effective collector must
     be.  We approximate this by requiring sensor arrays to take up Hard
     Points, just like weapon mounts do.
     
          a. Sensors of Planetary range or less do not require hard points.
          
          b. Sensors of greater than Planetary range take up one hard point
     per range band beyond Planetary range.  For example, a Far Orbit range
     Active EMS array takes up one hard point.  An Interstellar range
     Passive EMS array takes up 6 hard points.
     
     2. Sensor arrays may be mounted on booms.  One boom provides area
     equivalent to five hardpoints for the purpose of mounting sensor
arrays
     ONLY.  One boom may be mounted per hard point.  Sensor booms
     may be either (a) fixed, or (b) retractible.
     
          a. Fixed booms make the ship unstreamlined, and raise its Object
     Size category by one; e.g., an ObjSize=small ship with one or more
     fixed booms is now ObjSize=Average.
     
          b. Retractible booms take up 135 kl per boom, but the ship is
only
     unstreamlined while they are extended.  It is also one ObjSize larger
     as per fixed booms, but only while the booms are extended; it reverts
     to normal ObjSize when they are retracted.
     
     3. Densitometers - MUST be mounted on booms on any ship that uses
     artificial gravity in any form (Thrusters, Grav maneuver, Grav plates,
     inertial compensators) so that the densitometer can be properly
     shielded from the Artifical Gravity fields on the ship.
     
     4. Neutrino sensors are entirely internal and do not take up booms or
     hardpoints.
     
Option: apply these rules for wide-band communicators (receivers only).
 
 
Naval J6 Courier TL15
 
  The typical Imperial Navy Fleet Courier; one known example is the Fleet
Courier "Ahrimani" (pay attention Phil!).  Notice the tradeoff of some
offensive capability for Passive sensors that are not mounted on booms
(hence, no increase in detectability when in use), and the lack of active
sensors (good active EMS arrays required too much defensive capability to
be sacrificed, and the ship\'s primary mission is NOT offensive.)

I disagree with MT robots on practical grounds:  the crew requirements
stated in MT are meaningless, when the average model-1 has an equivalent
INT of 10, and an EDU of (about) 200.  This would allow your average
model-1
to provide 50 men for the crew of a ship, even without synaptic processors.
So put one guy on board to control the computer, and let the computer
handle
all the rest (unless your ship is over 5000T, anyway.)

WHy not?  If I have a computer controlling my J-drive (some of those
thousands of processors), why can\'t I have another to control the M-drive?
I suspect (based on SOM) that while they speak of "massively parallel"
machines, they really mean parallel machines netted together.  And you
can net anything together.

If so, then once the software methodologies were developed (those for TL15
must have been developed by 960 or so), they can be applied at any TL with
computers.  So any computer size could be built at any TL.  And I thought
we were already building massively parallel machines in the USA.

weeks worth of TML at once.  In the first batch (and I\'m nowhere near caught 
up), three things caught my eye, so here goes ...
 

On antimatter rockets, the space shuttle, and the USAF

I believe that this idea was proposed by Dr. Robert L Forward (who else?) and
is detailed in his book "Future Magic".  The gist of the idea is that
antimatter is the most compact possible form of energy storage, and that
current research accellerators are capable of producing usefull quantities of
the stuff (ie: fractions of a gram).  Several containment ideas are being
tested; he describes one such in his book.  Finally, to make it all
economically possible, he observes that each ton of rocket fuel carried aboard
the Space Shuttle (for the upper stage motors which propel satellites from the
low space shuttle orbit to higher orbits) costs millions of dollars in terms of
shuttle cargo capacity.  If all that fuel can be replaced by a tiny amount of
antimatter and a few kilograms of containment, the money saved in shuttle cargo
fees will more than pay for the antimatter.

The above is from memory; Dr. Forward has the whole thing worked out, and it
looks quite possible with "current" technology.  See his book for more details;
I can\'t find my copy right now or I would quote from it.  Also in this book are
a number of even more speculative pieces, including a neutrino communicator (!)
and various space/time travel devices.  Recommended!


Commerce Raiding

Commerce raiding by pirates and privateers will probably have an effect on
trade and commerce entirely out of proportion to the number of ships taken
and the number of privateers operating.

  "... such exploits as these, in or near British home waters, caused
   outrage there.  \'The have literally swept our seas,\' said the Naval
   Chronicle, \'blocaded our ports, and cut up our Irish and coasting
   trade ... The insurance between Bristol and Waterford or Cork is now
   three times higher than it was when we were at war with all Europe!\'"
  "The Admiralty was inundated with letters demanding protection, and
   public meetings were held in Liverpool and Bristol to get the point
   over."

   Quoted from _To Shining Sea, A History of the United States Navy_, by
   Steven Howarth, pp 117; quoting from _Naval Chronicle_, v 32, pp 243-5.

The major damage is likely to be due to the *perception* of a threat, not the
threat itself.  Although the threat of piracy is weak compared to the 
strength of the available naval and other protective vessels, some ships are
likely to be attacked.  The perception of this risk by the public (and in
particular by the shippers and insurers) will determine the extent of the
damage to interstellar trade.  A trebling of insurance rates would likely
destroy a free trader\'s profit margin, but given the risk of loosing a cargo,
it is also likely that no shipper would ship an uninsured cargo.  Finally, a
certain level of insurance could be mandated by the ship\'s finance agreement,
to protect the lender in case of the loss of the vessel.  Typically such
insurance payments are bourne by the borrower, and are paid in installments
with the loan payments.  Many smaller operators will find themselves in the
position of being unable to make a profit when insurance rates rise, or being
unable to operate at all without insurance.


Skill "levels"

When I have to explain Traveller skills to new players, I generally use some
variant of the table below; its crude, but gives most people a good idea of
what they can (and cannot) successfully attempt.

Skill-0 == Hobbyist; has some knowledge of the subject, and has observed or 
           studied basic operations, but may not have much (if any) practical 
           experience or judgement, especally in emergency situations.
Skill-1 == Apprentice; the minimum skill for employment in the field.  Knows
           all basic operations, but needs practice and experience to smooth
           off the rough edges.  Knows basic theory as applied by skill.
Skill-2 == Journeyman; average professional skill, competent in routine and
           many emergency situations.  Most professional starship pilots
           navigators, and engineers will be Skill-2.
Skill-3 == Master; high professional skill.  In larger operations, the 
           department head or other supervisor will be Skill-3.  Typically the
           best skill level available for hire.
Skill-4 == Expert; generally acknowledged as "the best" (at least in the local
           area).  Talent this good is usually not for hire; player characters
           and "character" adversaries will be this good, NPC\'s won\'t.
Skill-5 == Legendary.

In my campaigns, I do not force skill rolls for every use of a skill (for
example, pilot, navigation, and engineering rolls are not called for on every
jump).  I call for rolls when the task is performed in combat or other extreme
stress, or when the task to be performed is beyond the normal capacities of
the skill.  For example, I migh call for a pilot roll when landing in a severe
storm (severe enough that the port is closed to traffic), or with a damaged
vessel.

Assuming that additional (attribute or situation) DM\'s of +1 or +2 apply:
Unskilled characters have a *CHANCE* of performing Simple and Routine tasks.
Skill-0 is the lowest level to have a chance of performing a Difficult task.
Skill-2 is the lowest level to have a chance of performing a Formidable task.
Skill-5 is the lowest level to have a chance of performing an Impossible task.


The Spacer\'s Guild

In some of my campaigns, there is the Spacer\'s Guild.  The Guild is basically
a union, and the dues are about Cr 20 annually; membership is open to the
skilled operating crew of spaceships and starships.  The Guild provides skill
testing and certification, sets recommended pay scales and personnel practices,
and provides additional benefits for members.

Guild Benefits for Crew
a) Skill certification ("working papers") for crew positions.  Ensures that
   all positions are filled by safe, skilled workers.
b) Guild hiring halls or job boards at all major ports (Class C or better).
c) Insurance (Unemployment, Disability, Life, and Medical) and Retirement Plans
   are available at competitive rates through the Guild.
d) Guild Credit Union; interstellar banking services for Guild members.
e) Recommended Practices protect Guild members from unfair personnel policies
   (the Working Passage rule); standardized pay scales for crew positions.
f) Guild Hostels (food and lodging at reduced rates) at major starports.

Additional Guild Benefits for Owners/Captains
a) Skill certification removes guesswork from hiring; Guild hiring halls
   provide a ready source of labor, and convenient facilities for interviews.
b) Recommended Practices provides a consistent pay scale and policies to
   make administration easier.

Referee\'s Information

Starship operations are classed in different ways by the Guild, depending on 
how much control the Guild has over ship operations.  To enforce its rules,
or as a bargaining point, the Guild can threaten strikes, slowdowns and the
other usual tactics of organized labor.  Guild presence varies from area to
area; in some areas, Guild presence is very strong, and it is virtually
impossible to operate in the face of a Guild strike.  In other areas, Guild
presence is weak.

Guild Ship : Guild membership and certification are required of all crew.  The
  Guild has great influence over pay and personnel policies.  Many of the
  smaller lines (that don\'t have the resources to fight the guilds) are in
  this category.  Larger lines, particularly in economically depressed areas
  are sometimes able to win concessions from the Guild - their contracts will
  vary somewhat, even though they be an all-Guild operation.

Free Ship : Employment is without regard to Guild membership status; the
  majority of independent ships falls into this category.  Provided that they
  follow most of the Recommended Practices, the Guild will usually leave
  independent operators alone.  Some Guild contracts specify a fixed
  percentage of Guild Ships to Free Ships within a company.  In many areas,
  agreements exist between Independent Starship Operator\'s associations and
  the Guild to provide each other with preferential treatment.

Closed Ship : Guild members are not employed (except perhaps in the most dire
  of emergencies).  Some megacorporations are closed to Guild members (they
  are closed to all outsiders, and perfer to recruit and train their own
  crews).  Some particularly stubborn lines are also closed; this tactic has
  been used to keep the Guild weak in areas where it has little influence.

In order to join the Guild, a character must have one of the space-related
skills (Pilot, Navigator, Engineer, Gunner, Steward, Ship\'s Boat, Vacc Suit),
or skilled job found aboard a starship or spaceship (certified skills include 
Computer, Electronic, Mechanical, and most vehicle skills) at Skill-1 or 
better.

The Guild administers Skill Certification tests ("working papers") for all of
the skills listed above; the testing fee is Cr 5 per test.  If the character 
has the skill to the level claimed (Apprentice, Journeyman, or Master), 
passing the test is a Simple task.  If the character does *NOT* have the skill
 claimed, passing will be Difficult (Edu also applies in this case).

The Guild also administers Captain\'s Certificates.  Unlike the skill tests,
this certification does not test any specific skill; instead it tests the
administration of a starship, and in particular, the Guild\'s Recommended
Practices.  Guild Captains get preferential treatment at Guild hiring halls,
even if they operate a Free Ship (the Captain\'s Certificate is required, of
course, for the Captains of Guild Ships).

Little-Known Information about the Guild

The Guild Credit Union operates as an interstellar financial institution for 
Guild members, and manages the Guild insurance and retirement funds.  Much of
this money is re-invested into interstellar commerce.  Companies which operate
Guild Ships, and Guild Certified independent operators get preferential
treatment for these loans, which are usually at the standard rates.

Virtually all of the Guild contracts contain a little-known "return home"
clause, which allows members to return to their homeworld of record by
succesive working passages.  Captains with unfilled crew berths are required
to take Guild members travelling toward their homeworlds as working passages,
even if the person is not qualified for the position.  These "return home" 
passages may be bumped if the Captain fills the position with a qualified 
crewmember before departure.  To limit the inconvience of providing life 
support for these "deadhead" crewmembers, the passage is limited to one jump.

Role-playing notes

Sometimes it is very usefull to have a space-going "Teamster\'s Union" to
place into your trade-and-commerce campaigns.  The Guild can be a patron,
an adversary, or a resource, depending on how the referee feels and how the
players act.


What to do when you\'re cut off from the net

One of the side effects of being cut off from the net is that I have had a
chance to attack a number of very thick books I have had lying around the
house for some time now.  Although these are not (by any stretch of the
imagination) science fiction books, they are likely to be usefull to Traveller
referees and players (you can never know too much about the forces which
shape human history).  Anyway, I recommend:

_To Shining Sea_, A History of the U.S. Navy 1775-1991, by Steven Howarth 
(Random House, 1991).  A history of the US navy, as written by a British
historian.  He provides an interesting viewpoint on the US Navy; especially
in the early period, where he has incuded commentary on the American threat
by contemporary British officers.  Although the sections concerning the Civil 
War are a little weak, Howarth manages to cover all of the important points
in a single volume.

_Dreadnought_, England, Germany, and the Coming of the Great War, by Robert
K Massie (Random House, 1991).  Massie explores the personalities that 
changed the shape of European politics in the period leading up to the 
start of World War One.  Wonderful background for Space: 1889, of course.
Even more interesting is the way that individual personalities alter the
political and diplomatic landscape. 

_The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers_, Economic Change and Military Conflict
from 1500 to 2000, by Paul Kennedy (Random House, 1987).  This book is rough
sledding, and the least recommended of the three.  Kennedy provides ample
illustration for his theory of economic power (and its extention to military
and political power).


 Wildstar
 ----
 Imagine if you will, converting the following to Traveller ...

 September 14, 1803: The USS Constitution, under the command of Captain Edward
 Preble, is bound for Gibraltar, with orders to do "something drastic" about
 the problem of pirates and terrorists operating out of Algeria, Tripoli,
 Tunis, and Morocco [isn\'t it funny how some things never change?].

"At twilight, a strange sail had been sighted, too distant for identification.
As darkness gathered, Preble approached warily.  All that was certain was that
the other ship, like his own, was a man-of-war.  Constitution\'s decks were
cleared for action.  At last the stranger was close enough to hail.  \'What
ship is that?\' Preble called out.  It was the standard international question,
to which the standard answer should have been given in order: nation, rate,
class, name, commander\'s name.  Instead, the question itself came back through
the dark: \'What ship is *that*?\'  Suprised at the breach of custom, Preble
replied, "This is the United States frigate Constitution,\' and repeated, \'What
ship is that?\'
"\'What ship is that?\' - the question came back like an echo.  Unless all the
other crew were deaf or their captain mocking him, Preble could only assume
an attack was being prepared.  \'I now hail you for the last time,\' he shouted.
\'If you do not give a proper answer, I will fire a shot into you.  "\'If you 
do,\' came the spirited but improper answer, \'I will return a broadside.\'
"\'WHAT SHIP IS THAT?\' Preble bellowed, patience almost at an end.  The reply
was imperious: \'This is His Brittanic Majesty\'s 84 gun ship of the line 
Donegal, Sir Richard Strachan.  Send a boat on board.\'  That did it.  Preble 
roared at it: \'*This* is the United States 44 gun ship Constitution, Captain 
Edward Preble, and I\'ll be damned if I send a boat on board any ship!\'  And to
his gunners below he called out: \'Blow your matches, boys!\' [this is the 
command for the gunners to light their matches and stand ready to fire]
This must have been heard on the other ship.  A little rowboat came paddling
up apologetically toward Constitution; an English officer came on board; and
Preble discovered that the unknown craft was not an 84-gun ship of the line
but a frigate with 12 guns fewer than his own.

As has been discussed before, the superbatteries in the MT
Referee\'s Manual are much too expensive for use in anything
larger than a robot.  But we know that, in the real world,
diesel-electric submarines run for long periods on batteries, and
that electric cars, running on batteries, are expected to become
generally available within a few years.
 
Has anyone a table, for use in Traveller, of price and storage
capacity for large-capacity batteries such as these applications
would require?  If no one has one, can someone generate one?  We
could make the improvement per tech level proportional to the one
for superbatteries, but we need a value to begin with, and I have
no idea what an appropriate value would be.

anything larger than small electronic devices.

I completely agree.  My experiments with designs using batteries found them
totally unusable for nearly all applications.  The diesel electic subs I\'ve put
on the TML are horrendously expensive due to the cost of batteries.

I remember I designed a TL 5 small coastal submarine and it cost 1.5 times as
much as a Dreadnought of the same TL.  My attempts at TL6 were a little better.
A US WW II \'Gato\' Class fleet type sub cost only equal the amount of a TL6
battleship (Bismark class)

I also remember Rob Dean\'s electric buggy (TL 5?) that could seat 2 passengers
and cost something like a million credits?  Geez!

Now all of this was done before the Naval construction rules came out and said
that TL 5 and 6 batteries should weigh 5 times as much as the others (Not sure
about this, I don\'t have any of my trav stuff with me.)  Well, all I can say is
that GDW really goofed up here.

Also, The article by George Gannon in the latest challenge, about nuclear
fission shows that he never has done any designs using fission as the power
plant.  My calculations showed that a nuclear sub (using MegaTrav fission
rules) would burn up from as low as 60% to as much as 200% of the total mass
of the sub during it\'s stated cruising range.  The USS Nautilus, the first
nuclear submarine was refueled after 2 years.  There is no way you can build
a ship that can do that using the Megatrav rules.  You have to cheat.  I use
the hourly fuel consumption for fission plants for one year.  Comparing this
to the figures I have on the fuel consumption of the US Savannah, this is
within the ball park of reasonableness.  (Don\'t have the figures at my finger
tips, but I can look em up if ya want \'em)

Solutions for batteries?  Well, my car battery is about 5 liters in volume
and cost $30.  It is TL 7 technology.  (Doesn\'t help a lot, but it\'s a start)

Why use batteries when you can used closed fuel cells? There are many
variations on these; basically you burn hydrogen and oxygen to produce water
and energy, in a closed loop. Whenever required, you use external power
(utility grid, solar panels, ship fusion reactor) to crack the water back
into hydrogen and oxygen, so that it can be reused.

These are currently available, although expensive; certainly even slight
increases in TL will make them cheap and small.

If my information is correct, current fuel cells are *much* more efficient
than any currently available batteries, for size/weight.

I was wondering . How do you work out a robots stats in \'race\' terms . ie
Str, Int Educ etc ....

The last issue of the Megatraveller journal (or was it digest), that is the
last issue before it had its format changed, there was an adventure in the
magazine which had a robot, aybee (?), and he had human stats . 

Also If anyone has any of their own guidlines close at hand (say on disk), do
you think they would mind mailing it to me ......

When I was wondering through the referee\'s manual, it stated under energy (?)
tech 9 that super conductors came into being . With this in mind I looked at
the batteries and thought well this sux . This is mainly cause in mines they
use ore carts powered by batteries . They work continously for 8 hours, and
consist of about 10 ore carts driven by a battery power source . These things 
are moving nearly all the time, with a huge load of ore (Each ore cart carry\'s
about a ton) . They would move (on rails abeit) a good 20-30 kms an hour . 
They have approxiamtly 36 car batteries on racks in the driving car . At the
end of the day they simply just recharge them . 

With this in mind I made the following adjustments for batteries that worked
very well . Batteries tech 9 plus had their power increased by tenfold, and
their original price divided by 100 . 

I then and went and mucked around with vehicles and came out with a small 
4 seater battery powered car (tech 9) for around about 12,000 credits . 

The rules I use with batteries are that for every \'hour\' of the battery used,
it must be recharged for an hour . So this means no battery powered starships, 
but small battery cars, that could be used for 8 hours (from my design), then
hooked up to the garage generator during the night to be fully ready the next 
day . It also ment, at tech 15, that a beam laser, for the space of roughly
3.5 kliters, could have enough battery power for an hour (5 combat turns) for
the weapons, for around about 500,000 credits . 

Well I guess you should congratulate me, I just solved the worlds pollution
problem <grin> . Provided superconductors come in soon . 

(If anyone is interested in seeing my designes for the car and for a starport
tender (ie grav based golf buggy, powered by batteries, used by starport main
trenance) I am willing to sent them in . 

Well thats about it .....

Of course, the latest battery technology appears to be able to make electric

the relevant article.  If there\'s interest, I could hunt it down.)  Part of
technological cost is developing the infrastructure for a technology, but
that shouldn\'t be part of the cost in Traveller, since it is perhaps safe
to assume that technology is reasonably stable.  Or one could charge extra
for "new" technology on a given planet.

The psionics system in Traveller seems awfully skeletal. 
Fortunately, the game universe is structured so that, in
practice, you can ignore psionics if you want to.
 
I would, however, like to include psionics in a campaign I\'m now
planning.  Given the flexibility of Traveller\'s task system, it
should be fairly easy to convert the psionics system from another
game for use in Traveller.
 
I\'ve glanced at a copy of a game called "Psi World," and I now
that there is a GURPS source book on psionics, though I have not
read it.
 
Has anyone out there tried to make such a conversion?  If so,
what system works well, and how have you implemented it?

Please take my name off the TML.  The job has taken a change in which
I can no longer get to the computer until long periods of time have
elapsed.

I learned a great deal about the playing and rules of Traveller by reading
this mailing list.  I just wished that GDW gave as much time to Traveller
stuff as they did to some of there other games.

I am also sending this letter to the james@wrgate.wr.tek.com
address, just to make sure that I have all the bases covered.

That is all.

devised a new set of Psionics rules that all the players are extremely pleased
with.

I\'m not up to date on what the actual rules are at the moment, as he does
not have them down on media yet, but a character has a secret roll made on generation, and the character can train or whatever, and this value will be taken
into account - the character does not know his/her potential until (s)he gets
there.  Additional depth has been given to psionics...

As an example, my character was the head of a psionics institute, and the other
characters students and collegues.  (yes, it\'s is predominantly as psi adventure)  anyway, the institiute is stormed by imperial troops, and we have made our
way out of here, but one of my collegues was injured and in a coma.  Having an
interest in psionic theory, I do some calculations and project in to witchspace
where I find my collegue\'s "mind". It is wandering precariously and I try to
guide it back to reality.  Whilst in witchspace, I spotted something in the
"distance" - a corpse - somehow this being had teleported their body in to
witchspace and got caught.  I took the body back in to reality...

Now, my character is not the most attractive woman (yes I play a female), so she
has various nervous breakdowns on finding such a baeutiful body, so perfect and
un spoilt, what I beefed up on psi drugs and projected in to the body and took over it, leaving my old body perminantly - little did I know that this creature
had ruby red eyes, fangs, a blood lust, and various other strange attributes.
I had become a vampire ...

There\'s more to say after this, but I feel that i\'m going on a bit!  Needless
to say, this new psi rule system adds a definate bit of spice to psi in
traveller - also covered is the ability for non living entities to have
psi (due to magic), magic, witchcraft, etc.  You might say that the system
covers every fascet of supernatural activity - also covered is magical
items!  If you would like, I will get the full rules and add it to the
TML Nightly some time in the near future.

Once long long ago, while I was doing battery tradeoffs
for a UC Berkeley/NASA study on Mars Spacesuits,
I got bored and checked the numbers for the Traveller
batteries against what we had around today for real.
It turns out that we\'re just about right, and that
the projection for TL9 is about in line with what
is reasonable to guess will be usable by 2010.
Even more impressive is that the TL10 and 11 entries
are _also_ on line with that theoretically will be
state of the art in 2030 and 2050 8-) (Note that as
an engineer, I don\'t put much faith in more than 10 
year development prediction, but it\'s nice to know
that the traveller stuff agrees with presumed reasonable
values...).

The only thing that\'s high is cost.
The given costs are roughly in line with space-rated
battery costs.
One could presume that less tough (and less tested...)
batteries for ground vehicles are possible and
cheaper.
Radio shack, for instance sells TL7.5 NiCad batteries
for about 65% of Traveller figures, and you could
probably halve that for bulk purchases at wholesale.

                         "Johnny Cab"

    CraftID: Ground Car, TL 9, Cr3615
       Hull: 2/4, Disp = 1.75, Config 4USL, Armour 4B,
             Unloaded =  3 tons, Loaded = 4.4 tons .
      Power: 1/2, Battery = 0.1MW, Duration = 8 Hours
       Loco: 1/2, , Wheels Road = 75 kph, Offroad = 15 kph .
      Commo: Radio (Very Distant) .

      With the advent of \'super\' batteries at the tech level 
      9 period, the greenies dream the pollutionless car       
      appears . The car can be used for 8 hours until the 
      batteries run down, then it requires a recharge 
      lasting the amount of hours the car was used for .               
      When such a car is built at tech level 9, most other 
      cars are banned as too dangerous, fast, noisy, and 
      polluting . In fact on many worlds the driver is 
      banned and a nav computer/driver is required by law 
      (costing around 5,000 credits) . On many worlds, the 
      private ownership of a vehicle is also banned, and 
      people have to rely on public transport . The advent 
      of which comes the \'johnny\' cab . The johnny cab is 
      fitted with a nav computer, and drives to the place of 
      the patrons request, as long as it is within the 50 km 
      radio reciever range . The cab company\'s computer 
      keeps its \'eye\' on all its cabs . The cabs work on 8 
      hour shifts, then come in for rechargring . Fare is 
      collected as the patron gets in . If the patron       
      decides to stop before the destination is reached, 
      then the cab will refund the patron the saved fare . 
      The cab often has small camera\'s and recievers built 
      into the cab, to act as a theft warning device . If 
      the cab is interfered with in anyway it will stop as 
      soon as it is safly possible, power down, lock the 
      doors and notify the local law enforcement authorities 
      . The complete johnny cab package costs around 30,000 
      credits . 

      Editors Note: This design assumes that the power 
      output for batteries has been increased by a factor of 
      ten, and the price is 1% of the book price . This is 
      because I feel that at tech 9, battery problems have 
      been solved due to the advent of \'superconductors\' [NB 
      I am not a scientist] . Also at tech 9, the batteries 
      have to be replaced every year (Costing around about 
      five hundred credits for the above model) . 




                          "Mule"

    CraftID: Grav Utility, TL 9, Cr6633
       Hull: 1/2, Disp = 0.75, Config 0USL, Armour 1 (D),
             Unloaded = 0.20 tons, Loaded =  2.2 tons .
      Power: 1/2, Battery = 616/0.237 MW , Duration = 0/1
       Loco: 1/2, StdGravThrust= 2.25 tons, NOE = 7 kph,
             Vacuum =  27 kph, NOE = 7 kph .
      Commo: Radio (Distantx5)
    Sensors: Headlights
        Off: 
        Def: Def/Mod = +2
    Control: Panel = Electronicx1 , Environ = basic environ, 
     Accomm: 1 Operator/Driver , Seats = 4xCramped
      Other: Cargo = 1.5kliters; 100 liters,   ObjSize = Faint, 
             EMLevel =  Small.

      The mule is a time honoured design . It is used in 
      thousands of starports / vessels across the imperium . 
      It was designed as a small transport of starport staff 
      and their equipment . It is often used in large 
      merchant and naval vessels as transport for crew . It 
      can carry 1.5 kliters of equipment mounted in a cargo 
      bin at the back of the mule (above the batteries) . It 
      has a small 100 liter compartment under the drivers 
      feet . It moves at 7 kph, and the batteries last 
      approx 8 hours before they need recharging (8 hours 
      the recharge) . 

      Note this vehicle as made an authors assumption about 
      batteries . The vessel here assumes batteries at 10 
      times their strength, and price computed per 0.1 
      kliters not per 0.001 kliters . The batteries need 
      replacing every year (At a cost of 1185 Cr) .

      By the way I designed these after watching all the
      great starwars scenes in docking bays (eg just before
      they move out to destroy the Death Star) .

The dialect of Galanglic spoken in the Antarean region is called
"Transform" in the Imperial Encyclopedia.  I believe that, in the

  So you see that to get 1MWh, rechargable, we\'d need 30 tons of car batteries
(the volume would probably be quite small, though) and I think that this is
the kind of batteries that subs use.

  I guess that the figures for all the new funny batteries (Sulfur-?) are much
better than those above.

Hm, I wonder if we\'re getting a bit higher on the battery tech chart.  I got
those figures at last.  A Michigan company, Ovonic Battery Co., claims to have
solved the corrosion problems with metal hydride batteries by means of a
particular alloy for the electrode.  The design is similar to NiCad, with the
metal hydride replacing the cadmium as the negative electrode.  They claim the
sealed battery exhbits almost twice the energy densities of NiCad, has a
recharge time of only 15 minutes, and last the life of the car.  What TL
would this battery, assuming their claims are accurate, correspond to?
(I\'m pulling my reference out of Popular Science.)  Apparently this battery
is cheap enough that Hyundai has signed with them, and Chrysler is considering.

Meanwhile, BMW engineers say that their current sodium-sulfur batteries have
four times the storage capacity of the same-weight lead-acid batteries.
Unfortunately they last only one year.

Maybe someone out there could calculate what these translate to in TL numbers?
[Yes, I\'m hoping that we\'ve achieved TL 8.5.  :)]

Discover magazine (I am told) has an interesting article on the capability of
the electric car engineered by GM and another firm.  It uses conventional
lead-acid batteries and apparently will be affordable and practical for urban
use.

Oh, and that was an interesting comment about discount (and unreliable) tech.
Hm... Honest H\'gurna\'s bargain basement fusion plants?

As embarrassed as I am to admit this (running one of the two characters
in the PBEM whose Transform is so thick you can spread it on bread),
I do not know of any reference in the literature, offhand, that might
explain the origin of the word. I\'m going to reread the relevant stuff--
I *think* there\'s a contextual implication that one can pick up, but
nothing official.

/fib indicates "Fiber Optic Backup", meaning that the computer is safe in
environments where there is a lot of electromagnetic radiation that can
upset electronic circuits.

/bis means "enhanced", if I remember correctly in Classic Traveller these
computers had more CPU but less storage.  I don\'t remember offhand what the
tradeoffs are for MegaTraveller.

> If you have three planets circling a binary system with the B star at

The type of the stars is not important to this discussion.  What matters
is what orbits the planets are in.  In this situation I think you roll
for the number of available orbits for each star.  Generally, the
Primary star will typically have orbits 1..n (n < 10?) available, and
the Secondary will have fewer 1..m (m < 6?) orbits.

In the case of Close binaries, the stars are nearly touching and have a
single shared planetary system.  In the case of Far binaries, the stars
are way far away and have complete and independent planetary systems.
The only time things get wierd are when the stars are in the in-between
range.

I know these answers are not definitive; I hope they are helpful and
inspire better understanding of the ruleset.

	The Kliemoshie landed away from the starport at the digs.  A
small patch of bedrock had been cleared for traffic near the digs
accommodating the courier and a fat trader belonging to the
League of Suns Expedition.
	The site was away from prying eyes and onlookers.  Partly
because of the fact it was in the middle of a desert, but mostly
because news of its discovery was carefully monitored.  Drert\'s
one and only comment was:  "Another fuckin\' desert."  But the
scenery was more striking:  jagged rocky mountains, a variety of
terrain from dry washes and lakes to intricate canyons,
contrasting to Aramat\'s shifting dunes.
	"Welcome to Enoc, Doctor Malenkoviepr."  Dr. Lorain Messandi
stood out on the pad to greet the arriving archeologist.  She
wore a light jacket and skirt that looked only slightly out of
place at an archeological dig:  just a little too fancy to be out
digging in.
	Dr. Malenkoviepr looked down from the hatch of the ship at
the figure now extending a hand to him.  He first saw her some
eighteen years ago when he had met with her father.  She had been
eight at the time, and he physically the same age as he was now.
Since then he had grown in archeological prominence, as did she,
but every time he saw her...  Now what is really known about
sexual imprinting in humaniti?  This could be a very interesting
and pleasant psychological experiment...
	"Good it is to see you again Lorain.  I see you\'ve found
something more interesting than reading dry old papers about the
Sky Raiders."
	"It will do for a bit, and it gives me the opportunity to
show you up for once."
	"Going to let all the hot air out of the ancients study?"
	"Sure, come on over and see my digs, Mako."
	Dr. Malenkoviepr took the extended arm and descended the
Kliemoshie\'s ladder.
			- X -
	The ancients dome was a low wide structure sixty four meters
in diameter looking like a huge brown saucer sitting on the
ground.  Mounds of sand lay nearby cleared away from the site
with grav sifters more gently and quickly than the more
traditional tooth brush would wipe them away.
	The dome had only a few entrances: one at the ground level,
and some about fifteen meters above the ground.
	The two archaeologists entered accompanied by the crew of
the Kliemoshie, and two rather sullen looking Imperial marines in
battle dress to keep the "dirty Zhos" out of trouble.
	Rows of emergency lamps had been rigged up to light the
darkened structure.  Lorain flipped on a switch revealing the
inside of the wrecked building.  It was mostly empty with large
rising platforms in the center of the dome.  Here and there
scattered around the base of the platforms were pools of metals
once molten they had flowed into random shapes forming unlikely
ink blot tests.  Malenkoviepr glanced at a few shapes and got a
small insight into his own current state of mind.  "But knowing
psychological patterns and desires does not fulfill them." he
thought, "But, unless I miss my guess, Lorain seems to be sending
some non-verbal signals this way..."
	"The smaller holes up top seem to be windows."  Lorain
Messandi picked up a melted and fused blob of a glasslike
material with five fold symmetry crystals of the same stuff
coming from it at irregular intervals.  "We found this stuff
underneath the windows.  Haven\'t figured out what it is yet, but
it appears to have melted, dripped out of the windows, and fallen
on the floor where it cooled.  We found traces up there on the
windows."
	"I see."
	"This stuff melts at 513 degrees Kelvin, and hard enough to
scratch diamonds:  hardness fourteen!"
	"Viepchakl!  Have you analyzed it for components yet?"
	"Not yet, but we\'re taking a small sample back to Alenzei
with us.  Our spectrometers are off, the analyzer told me plain
old water was phosphoric acid yesterday."
	"Perhaps, I can fix it, or at least allow you the use of
mine."
	"Very kind of you."  Lorain smiled with a smile that could
melt ice caps.  "Over here we have some stuff that must have been
interesting but it\'s obviously broken.  There were what we think
were control panels over here but they all melted into slag.
This place must have been subjected to quite a bit of heat at
some point."
	"Was it the weapon that destroyed this place in the ancients
final war?"
	"I don\'t really think so.  It seems to me that if heat had
been the weapon used there would have been a lot more damage than
hit here.  Possibly vulcanism, but we can get a more accurate
reading from the rocks outside."
	"How would that work?" asked Miakr suddenly.
	"Well, the magnetic field of planets reverses over the
course of time.  By checking which way the magnetic field of the
rocks is pointed we can tell when they were last melted."
	"Oh, yeah."
	"Well, in any case the slag in this place is certainly
bizarre stuff.  Before our spectrometer broke down we analyzed
some of the melted remains of the control consoles.  Aluminum,
copper, yttrium, barium, gold, lead, bismuth, and of course
oxides of the lot of them."
	"Sounds like the remains of a super computer." remarked
Malenkoviepr thoughtfully.
	"A super computer?  How do you figure?"  wondered Lorain.
	"Well, yttrium, barium and copper are in high temperature
superconductors.  And it seems to me, a long time ago I had an
electronics course were we discussed the ultimate means of data
storage.  If you used a substance where each atom would represent
a piece of binary code, say one element being one and another
being zero, like lead and bismuth, which are soluble to each
other, you could have a very small data storage unit, for
instance, the sum of sentient knowledge could be put in a cube
one centimeter on a side."
	"How do you figure?"
	"Well, let me see, eleven grams per cubic centimeter so
eleven over two hundred and seven moles of lead or so, times six
point zero two times ten to the twenty third:  that makes..."
	"Three point five one nine times ten to the twenty third."
supplied Miakr.
	"Yes." sniffed Dr. Malenkoviepr.  "That is a very rough
estimate, not even taking into account the difference between
pure lead and lead-bismuth.  But it\'s within an order of
magnitude.  Three times ten to the twenty third bits of
information should certainly cover the sum of all knowledge."
	"Yes... I should think so."  said Dr. Messandi impressed.
"I\'m beginning to realize just how much difference there is
between studying the ancients and the sky raiders, and just how
far out of my field we are."
	"Oh, come on Lorain, it is merely a matter of what you are
used to looking for.  I would\'nt know a sky raider artifact if I
fell over it."
	"Well, I should hope not, some of us have to make a living
you know.  If you discovered every archeological treasure I\'d be
out of a job." she laughed.
	"On a more serious note we have this:"  Lorain held up a
large light blue crystal perhaps twenty centimeters long.  It
seemed to shimmer under the lights.  "It was found in a puddle of
pure gold."
	"Hmm!" hmmed Malenkoviepr taking the crystal and examining
it.  "Chemical analysis?"
	"Unknown, due to the spectrometer again.  Though it Does
have a hardness of eleven."
	"Perhaps a diamond form of some element other than carbon.
But I think I know what it is used for."
	"How?"
	"It looks like a crystal that is sometimes used in Droyne
coyn rituals.  The fact that it was found in a puddle of gold may
indicate that it was with some coyns when whatever melted this
place did so."
	"What sort of rituals is it used in?"
	"Well, it is used in a particular one when a young Droyne is
being casted, that is when the Droyne becomes a leader, sport,
drone, technician, warrior or worker.  They use this, or
something like this as a focus for their psionics.  I read a very
strong aura from it indeed."
	The two escorting marines shifted uneasily.  Their
expressions hidden by the helmets of their battle dress.
	Drert stepped forward, "Let me see that."  He took the
crystal from Malenkoviepr\'s hand.  He held it up to the light and
froze.
	The crystal began to glow.
	A low humming filled the room.
	A glowing blue globe came into existence around Drert\'s
hand.
	The globe began to expand.  It swelled to thirty centimeters
in diameter and contracted again.  Again it swelled this time to
forty centimeters and then contracted back again.
	"Drop it!" yelled Malenkoviepr, reinforcing the command with
telepathy.  Drert remained a frozen statue holding up the crystal
like a torch.
	Suddenly, Jietlshaiepr came flying across the room tackling
the statue of Drert that was becoming eclipsed by the oscillating
globe.  Drert fell to the floor but bounced and remained rigid as
though made of wood.  Jietlshaiepr and Niedrsha began wrestling
with rigid form to find it\'s hand and the crystal.
	Miakr stood enthralled by the beautiful blue globe.  Yes,
it\'s beautiful.  He started for it.
	Malenkoviepr flooded him with revoltion.  Revolting?  Miakr
hesitated, how could something so beautiful be revolting?  It was
calling after all...  He started forward once again.
	Malenkoviepr grabbed him and held him fast.
	Dr. Messandi looked on longingly at the globe.  Shtam stood
by, but with a hand on her shoulder lest she start forward.
	The globe continued to oscillate but began to shrink.
	"Hari vieck!" Jietlshaiepr shouted as she diverted the
strength of her mind to her hands.  She yanked the crystal from
Drert\'s hand to the sound of breaking bones.  She tossed it away
and it skittered across the floor.  The globe became a
hemisphere, and continued to shrink until it winked out.  The
crystal lay on the floor, a darker blue than it had been before.
	Drert lay frozen on the floor still in the position he had
been in when he held the crystal up.
	Jietlshaiepr examined Drert hurriedly, "got a pulse, still
breathing, comatose.  I\'m taking him to the ship."  She picked up
the statue that was Drert and marched out carrying him like a
briefcase under one arm.
			- XI -
	"Pulse rate sixty... Breathing rate twelve... Blood pressure
one fifteen over seventy... His hand\'s broken for sure... Wait a
minute... Not one broken bone?  Impossible...  EEG... no reading. 
Whatever hit him it\'s put him in a psionic shock.  Doctor
Malenkoviepr can you read anything from him?"
	Malenkoviepr concentrated, and probed.  There was none of
the usual flood of sensory input... no surface thoughts...
deeper...  deep down...
	A very faint image surrounded in blackness... very faint...
a hand?  Yes... a hand... a giant hand... no... a fist... a giant
fist, clenched tight... very tight....
	But slowly, very slowly almost imperceptible:  the fist was
beginning to open.
	"Dr. Malenkoviepr?" Miakr hesitated.
	"Yes?" Malenkoviepr replied opening his eyes.
	"The Imperial Marine commander wants to talk to you."
			- XII -
	It was early morning the next day when Malenkoviepr walked
back to the ship smiling.  "The deadhead commander wanted to know
how dangerous this is.  How am I supposed to know?  I have never
seen this before and they will not give me a chance to study it?"
he sighed rhetorically.
	"The marine commander kept you all night?" wondered
Niedrsha.
	Dr. Malenkoviepr glanced at Niedrsha.  "I had things to go
over with Dr. Messandi."
	"Drert\'s unchanged," sighed Jietlshaiepr changing the
subject, "but I was sure I broke his fingers when I ripped the
crystal out of his hand.  Sure, I tried to be careful but, I Know
I didn\'t succeed."
	"His hand is all right?"
	"Apart that it, like the rest of him, is paralyzed yes.  No
broken bones not even a bruise.  I try to have a light touch but
this is ridiculous."
	"You\'re not all that gentle." chided Niedrsha.
	"Be quiet you." she glared.
	"Ok, boss, last night Jiet planted some of the targeting
transmitters:  one in their motor pool, one at their HQ.  I
planted the long range triangulators.  All that\'s left is to set
one of these short range pills on their barracks."
	"Good work, no one saw?"
	"Nope, I\'m invisible with enough cover." explained Niedrsha.
	"I teleported in and out." explained Jietlshaiepr.  "I have
to wait until my psi strength recovers.  But speaking of psi
strength, Doctor Malenkoviepr, how is your own?"
	Malenkoviepr concentrated a moment.  He should have almost
completely recovered from yesterday\'s efforts.  "Strange, I seem
to be at full strength psionically.  As a matter of fact, I feel
even stronger than usual."
	"I feel the same way.  I realized it when you were gone.  It
is as though we didn\'t have to rest at all after the fracas with
the crystal.  I don\'t know if it will last, but right now I feel
like I\'m on a psi booster drug."
	"You think that crystal acted as a psi booster?"
	"Can\'t think of anything else we\'ve been in contact with."
	"You may be right."  Malenkoviepr thought for a moment.  "In
the casting ceremony the crystals are used as a focus, it could
be that they store psionic energy."
	"Wait, a minute."  I\'m no psi, but that thing probably
hadn\'t been touched in a couple of hundred thousand years, how
much charge could it have?" interjected Niedrsha.
	"But you are psi shielded, pilot Niedrsha..." began
Malenkoviepr.
	Silence descended on the room like a parachute dropped over
their heads.
	Malenkoviepr continued, ignoring Niedrsha, "If the crystal
is a storage device, then it might have been building up a charge
over all those years... and after three hundred thousand years of
non use it would have quite a charge built up by the time we
found it."
	"Yes, but what would all that energy do to Drert?" asked
Shtam.
	"Don\'t know.  We don\'t even know what it did to us."
	"There is one other thing," began Jietlshaiepr, "I don\'t
know about you all, but I\'ve got a rotten headache."
	Meanwhile the giant fist was uncurling agonizingly slowly.
			- XIII -
	A soft knock at Malenkoviepr\'s door roused him.  Odd, he
didn\'t even remembered falling asleep.
	"Come in?"
	The door slid open to reveal Jietlshaiepr standing head in
hand, her expression, body language, and demeanor spoke of
tiredness and pain.
	"Look, sorry to bother you, but I\'m exhausted, and I\'ve got
a splitting headache, so I\'ll come right to the point.  I need a
psionic probe."
	"What?"
	"This blasted headache, it started soon after the thing with
the crystal.  I can\'t find any medical reason."
	"And you think it may be psionic."
	"Yup."
	"A telepathic probe is a violation of a noble\'s right to
mental privacy."
	"Who cares?" she snapped tiredly.  "Look, I haven\'t been a
noble for long, until four years ago I was an intendant.  I
haven\'t got any great secrets.  Mind you I\'d appreciate it if
you\'d leave the sexual side of my mind alone, but even that\'s no
big deal.  And besides, diagnosing me will probably save a lot of
time with the others."
	"Others?"
	"The rest of the crew are irritable to some degree."
	"Very well.  But I may have to read your entire mind before
I find something."
	"Well, leave my id for last will ya please, I\'m not an
exhibitionist."
	"You\'d better lie down." he laughed, "This may take a
while."
			- XIV -
	It didn\'t take long to locate the trouble as he found it
broadcasting itself across her consciousness.  Jietlshaiepr was
broadcasting her own thoughts and receiving them again.
Telepathic feedback was building up.
	"You are a telepath."
	"What?" she cried incredulously, "No, I\'m not, I was tested
for that a long time ago.  I have some psi-talents but they are
all trained or training now.  Telepathy just isn\'t one of them."
	"You are getting psi-feedback; that\'s what is causing your
headache.  You are a telepath, but you do not know how to control
it."
	It took an hour to teach her to control the feedback, but
soon the headache was gone.  Once the mind has been opened,
telepathy is farily easy to control.  It\'s the opening of the
mind that is difficult, and in her case it had been pried open
with a crystal crowbar.
	When she was gone Dr. Malenkoviepr wondered at the
pervasiveness of the human libido throughout the mind.  Usually
one could probe someone else without getting too much of it.  But
in the short time he read Jietlshaiepr he had found a few tricks
to use with psionic bodily awareness he hadn\'t thought of before.
	Pilot Niedrsha certainly had his hands full with the ship\'s
doctor.
			- XV -
	"Right, now how are we gonna get that transmitter on the
marines barracks?" asked Niedrsha of no one in particular.  "We
need a diversion."
	"How about a loud argument in Zhodani?"
	"No, the deadheads would not even care." remarked Shtam.
	"Wait, how about this," said Miakr excitedly, "Two of us
could act drunk and distract their attention.  We could offer
them a drink or start a fight do or whatever we needed to do."
	Shtam shook his head, "No thanks, I certainly do not want to
get into a brawl with a bunch of trigger happy deadhead marines."
"And, I do not really understand Your desire to get your head
smashed."
	They all thought for a moment.  "Well hey," laughed Miakr,
"how about we show a pornographic film on the side of the ship.
If the marines are as bad as they are supposed to be then that
should distract them."
	The room went silent.  Jietlshaiepr stared at Miakr with
leveled eyes.
	She was gone.  Her clothes, where they had been, began to
float to the floor.
	Suddenly, one empty suit of battle dress got up and worked
it\'s way out of its rack.  It strode over to Miakr, and picked
him up by the collar with its left hand and dangled him half a
meter above the ground.
	The right hand pressed a button at the throat, and the
helmet split open like a clamshell.  Jietlshaiepr pulled Miakr
close to her and said with ice, "I don\'t think that\'s a very good
idea really.  Do you?"
	Vole chucked in the background sounding like a hyena.
	"Hold on, Jiet don\'t kill him." laughed Niedrsha.
	"I\'d maim him, just a little, but then again I\'d have to
put him back together wouldn\'t I?"
	"All right let us get back to planning." clucked Shtam
tiredly, "This is not going to help, and it just cost you an
hour\'s rest before you can teleport, Jietlshaiepr."
	"You have any ideas?" asked Miakr as he was lowered to the
floor not too gently.
	"How about a malfunction in the ship?" suggested Shtam.  "I
could rig a sort of spectacular display, alarms, flashing lights,
you outside screaming and yelling:  that sort of thing."
	"Sounds all right if it\'s loud enough to make them notice."
	"Oh, they\'ll Notice all right...."
	"We only need to distract them for two seconds, just long
enough for me to jump in and jump out."
	"Ok, a few hours after night fall."
			- XVI -
	Jietlshaiepr awaited the countdown in her battle dress ready
to teleport at an moment\'s notice.  Shtam and Vole were ready in
the engine room to control the \'malfunction\'.  The rest waited
out side.  Except of course Drert.
	The ship lay quiet in the darkness with a few lights
burning.  The light of the moons was barely enough to make out
the white outline of the aging courier ship.  She seemed a giant
white creature as she leaked hydrogen gas from her fuel tanks
into the night air.
	The sky exploded with blue sparks and red flame.  A fireball
leaped up above the Kliemoshie lighting the area in a temporary
daylight.  Alarms shrieked and howled, and the crew shouted and
ran towards the conflagration to be showered with water from the
burning hydrogen.
	Jietlshaiepr was already atop the Imperial Marines barracks.
She dropped the transmitter on the roof, and looked down.  Two
marines in battle dress stood there, one looking at the commotion
from the Kliemoshie and the other pointing straight at her.
	"Hey!  Uh, look up there, Dorset."
	Jietlshaiepr swallowed and teleported.
	"What is it Grindley?"
	"Uh... I don\'t know.  Maybe it was a bat."
	"A bat?"
	"Yeah, a big bat... A great big bat..."
	Dorset sighed in disgust at his moronic partner.

A question:  How much protection does a Taylored Vac suit provide from
brawling weapons?  Seems to me anything that was so strong as to provide
the phenomenal armor value of the Taylored Vac suit would have to be pretty
stiff and uncomfortable if it provides protection from low velocity impacts.

Ballistic cloth is a bit more different.  I can see how it could be made
pliable and even comfortable.  But a pliable and comfortable piece of
clothing won\'t help you much when someone comes after you with a baseball bat.

Mark?  Mike?  I\'m sorta interested in your responce to this one.  Seeing as
nearly everybody in the PBEM has one of these suits, it would help if we all
knew just how well they protected you from this sort of thing.

Yeah, Joe Fugate\'s off the cuff rationalizations usually rub  me the _wrong_
way, too.  However, just as a matter of idle curiosity, are you using the
jump governer = smaller jump drive fuel consumption, or the jump governer
= used/total fuel consumption?  In High Guard, they were the same, of course,
but in the new 5 + (5*jump) % system, they\'re not.  

Example:  A jump-3 now takes 20% of the hull\'s volume in fuel, and a jump-6
takes 35%.  Therefore, 2*j-3 <> j-6.  (J-6 is good for 3*j-1 plus a little...
\'overhead\' costs eat you alive at low jumps.)

UNIT OF TANDY ROLLS OUT FIRST `WEARABLE\' COMPUTER
By a Wall Street Journal Staff Reporter

Fort Worth, Texas-- Grid Systems Corp. said it rolled out its first
"wearable" pen-based computer, called the PalmPad, which includes a 
wrist strap allowing a user to carry the computer on his arm.

Measuring 6.2 inches by nine inches [why can\'t they keep their style
for numbers straight?] and weighing 2.8 pounds--about the size of
a hardcover book--the computer is designed primarily to fit comfortably
across the forearm and into the hand.  It uses the company\'s pen-based
software, which eliminates the need for typing on a keyboard.

Grid, a Fremont, Calif. unit of Tandy Corp., said it expects the Palm-
Pad to be used in areas such as manufacturing, distribution, law
enforcement and market research, where workers need to collect data
but don\'t want to be weighed down with bulky equipment.  Grid also
said the computer is designed to be durable enough to withstand a
three-foot drop onto concrete.

The machine, which was introduced at a "fashion show" in New York,
will sell for about $2,895.

PBEM Turn 92.02a  (731 lines) - THIS IS PART 1 OF 6.
=====================================================


 === Talisman ===

Redd watches Ralf\'s unconscious body in the lounge, occasionally
glancing at the medical tell-tales displayed on the rugged handheld he
found lying next to Ralf outside the engineering airlock.
	
The lighting flickers off, and for the briefest moment, the omnipresent
hum of power dies away, leaving the Talisman silent.  Redd sits in shadows,
lit only by the glow from Ralf\'s handheld display.  Seconds pass.  Ralf stirs.
His eyes open.  Weakly he lifts his head, and whispers a single word before
slumping back into oblivion.  "Rosebud."

"What the H**L !"

Kimball  Redd  hastily slaps his vac-suit helmet into place, pulls on the
gloves and begins checking the seals,  while using the suit radio to contact
the bridge.

"Bridge, Redd here - I\'m in sickbay with Ralf, what hit us ?"

"Ha!  Gotcha."  Ralf rolls to his feet in a fluid motion, sprightly
in the low gravity.  "Just kidding."  He scoops up the handheld in turning,
hitches it onto his belt without looking, and heads for the bridge.  "The
bridge?  No, wait.  My job\'s down in engineering, right?  No problem, I can
have the computer pipe the feeds down to my console there..." and off he
goes.
	
Looking round to find Ralf back amongst the living, and about to take off by
himself, Redd calls after him, his voice amplified by his suit speakers :

"RALF !"
"What do you think you\'re doing ? This is NOT a drill, get that vac-suit
sealed up NOW, and DON\'T go off without telling someone!"

Lowering the volume control back to normal, he continues:

"Look, just try to bear with the rest of us who haven\'t been able to
take a nice long rest & talk to IASIC, and don\'t have a clue what\'s
happening.  J.J. will probably be checking up on everyone any day now
<smile>, just as soon as they get organised up there." 

He pauses to listen to the rest of the ship - systems coming back on line,
people shouting a lot - no change there.

"Bridge - Redd & Ralf en-route to engineering, keep us posted.
<smiling again>
Sounds like everything got shut down - let\'s go fix things."

They make their way through the re-awakening ship, only slightly slowed
by the lack of internal gravity and dim emergency lighting. At least the
doors still work. 


 === Aurora ===

In the cargo hold of the Aurora, Christian has barely enough time to
note the belated arrival of Lucan, recently restarted by \'Vouf, and
the two newcomer robots carrying the limp form of Dr. Tweel, with Tiger
the Aeloid flapping alongside and whimpering softly at its master,
trying to elicit a response.... when he gets another distraction.

With a glaring flash, a disc-like opening of softly glowing white light
appears before him in mid-air. Dimly, through its haze, Christian can
make out the outlines of the familiar Sickbay in the Alcyon.

*I have returned those in need who were stranded upon Me to your care,
Healer. Now it is up to you to heal them!*

Christian quietly and respectfully responds, his gratitude plain. "I thank
you for your assistance. Heal them I shall."

Amidst the thrumming power of that voice, \'Vouf\'s voice is a tiny, 
easily-ignored peeping in Christian\'s comm unit. "Aenrra? You okay?"

"AENRRA, kae, you\'re back!" The anxiety and relief in Christian\'s voice
is testament to the strain of his situation. "The Hoop \'ported three
injured people to us, the trauma indicates they\'re crash victims, lord
only knows from WHERE."

His voice is suddenly infused with instinctive, professional concern,
yet his regret at the need for his services is clear. Christian curses
briefly. "Aenrra, the third is in very critical condition and I am
stabilizing him now. He\'ll need surgery soon. The other two are pretty
lucky, but they\'ll need some attention, as well as some enforced rest
and continuing observation."

Christian studies the hazy portal. "The Alcyon is best situated to handle
multiple bed-rest patients, the impending surgery, and the psychological
reorientation/briefing for the newcomers. The Hoop has opened a portal
for all of us down here. We\'re moving to the Alcyon for now."

The distant shadow of a memory prompts a near invisible glimmer in
Christian\'s eyes, as a very slight quaver in his voice is detectible
only by his vargr friend. "Wish me luck, aenrra. Keep me advised; I\'ll
do likewise. Take care of my ship. Van Der Merwe, out."

The veteran of countless medical emergencies firmly strides through the
R-Alphan gateway, beckoning for his rag-tag band to go through. "Lucan,
Dulinor, OSF, 333 ... Follow me." His gestures are decisive, his tone
cool and professional, as he forces his emotions aside to concentrate
his efforts on the daunting task ahead. The motley group passes through.
The portal hangs in the air for a long moment, then fades and flickers
into nothingness.

"Good luck, aenrra," Bhyarrvouf whispers. He watches the gate flicker
and fade on the cargo hold monitors, and switches off with a sigh.
"Looks like it\'s just you and me for a while, Moira," he sighs.

"Affirmative, Subcommander. All systems currently in active-monitor
mode, our course is stable and we are operating normally. If you wish
to rest, we will not require any action on your part for several
hours."

"Just kakh wonderful." \'Vouf looks at his gauntlets, now covered in 
Tweel\'s blood. "I\'d skip over to the Westwind, but SOMEBODY should
mind the store while Christian\'s gone...." He looks again at the 
tactical readout. His ears perk up and his eyes widen in disbelief.
"On second thought, why bother? That little shuttle\'s gonna have
them sniffing our tails in no time flat!"

He prepares a datapulse to send to the Kingfisher, still locked in
its private conversation with the Trakh. "Command Shuttle, this is
Bhyarrvouf on the Aurora. We are up and running normally again. 
Other status reports non-mission-vital. Contact when able. Out."

He then calls up the tight-beam communications board, establishes
a few other links, and flicks on his earbug. "This is the Aurora
broadcasting to all members of the former IASIC network. We\'ve
recovered okay and are now functioning normally. All ships report
in.  Paladin?  Bhranda kghfe zhdaetso, Goughzar?  Talisman?  Andon,
Thul-- everyone okay?"


 === Paladin ===

Goughzar sits stunned watching the information flashing by on the screens
ending with the farewell and the screens going black. As the screens fade,
the ship\'s light and power fade, the emergency systems click into life,
and Charyn thumps to the floor, something finally seems to snap in Zar.

"Arghoooo" and the howl falls to a growl and gravelly voice with the
definite tones and projection of command.

"Dr. Morser! Attend stations and bring the internal system of the Paladin
back on line! Dr. Limner, report at once to a terminal and begin work with
Dr. Morser to assess any damage to ship\'s systems and bring everything back
on line. Mr. Azani, report to the bridge and assist with Dr. Morser in any
way possible. Dr. Morser, when you have brought the computers back on line,
leave the rest to Dr. Limner and assist Mr. Robins".

Tense from the recent events, he moves to Charyn, cradles her head quickly
and then assumes his station at the helm. As systems come back on line, he
quickly slaves the controls of the pilot, navigation, and sensor panels to
his holodisplay and begins to bring up full scans.

When the systems are running... "Paladin, full tactical display and open
communications with Alcyon and Aurora. Full EMS active and passive scans
on ship last sighted. Continue with heading to Ringworld, do not modify
landing sequence. Damage control and status report on all functioning
systems".

As the seconds roll by, Goughzar watches as the commands roll through and
the displays light up again. _All systems functional, status reports all
systems rating at 100% with the exception of primary computer systems rating
at 180%._

"Good, identify all ships on tactical display and attempt identification of
new ship last known bearing 078 mark 12 at 2AU. Detailed analysis and damage
report given ship is type RT with a standard hull congfiguration of 1000tons."

Zar waits as the computer details information about the new ship and awaits
the opening of hailing between the Aurora, Paladin, and Alcyon.


 === Phin Shuttle ===

  * I\'m hoping to stay long enough to talk to the Hoop again, if it\'ll
    let us in again. * Ian moves to face Ferdy. * It asked me to bring
    back some crystals, and I have them... uh oh.  They\'re on the Talisman.
    Oh well.  I\'m not really able to say what we\'re all going to do.  I
    wanna party some, lay in the sun, meet new friends, and so on.
 
  * That sounds good. * Ferdy nods and flicks his tail.
 
  * I think some of the other humans with me want to learn all they can
    about your world, * continues Ian. * and some might want to take
    things.  It\'s hard to say. *
 
  * I dare say we can all manage to have some fun together. *
 
  * I really can\'t say what the Aslan are going to do. * Ian shrugs.  * I
    think they have some kind of predatory belief that this is now _their_
    world. (laugh). *
 
  * They sound like a very primitive race.  A bit like the Kythui, maybe? *
 
  * Ferdy? * Ian frowns. * Do you have something aboard that would work for
    my eyes - visual sensors?  I want to look outside at a passing miracle. *
 
  * What?  Oh, yes, of course.  Let\'s go back and find Doejin and I\'ll
    show you how the visual sensors work. *


 === Kingfisher ===

[Ger gives a long sigh...and places his left hand over his face, and
rubs his eyes. Ger then turns to Jett.]

"Judge, you are incorrect, this is a military mission, even if we are
not in an offical military unit. We are organized in a military fashion, 
we are armed and facing two potentially hostile forces. When we make 
landfall, then it will be a scientific expedition."

Richard Jett responds with alacrity, in crisp and crystal clear tones.
"No, sir! This is a CIVILIAN expedition, sir, which includes many former
military personnel, such as yourself, organized for SELF-PROTECTION. We
are here to investigate the unknown, sir, and TAKE RISKS! The aslan may
be hostile, but have they fired upon us? No! Are they likely to attack
us? Right now, no, as long as we don\'t PROVOKE them, sir! Who else is
hostile? The RINGWORLD? Iasic? Their acts are those of welcome and
curosity. Acting as you suggest may have STRONG consequences -- have
you CONSIDERED how the Ringworld, for Strephon\'s sake, how the ASLAN
may respond?"

As soon as Commander Ger start to speak Etienne half turns his acceleration
couch so that he can watch the Count while still being aware of the piloting
data out of the corner of his eye.  He makes no outward reactions, until...

"Besides Lazer is aiming his pistol at the wrong person, I issued the
order, Mr. DeMer is following orders, besides with a flick of a finger
I could have the firing controls routed to my console here..."

A small frown crosses his face as Etienne looks at Lazer and gives a 
small nod.

[Ger sivels his chair to look at where Farouk is standing.]

"Lazer I never thought that I would get any trouble from you, In fact
I was trying to keep you busy with little tasks so you wouldn\'t react
overly in security defense I didn\'t consider you the source of a
problem, remember also that there are things that you have been told 
under security."

[He then turns back to the nomal rest position for the chair, and
addresses no-one in particular]

"Don\'t you think that the ringworld will have active defenses? Do
you really believe that a single missile could do anything to somehting
the size of the ringworld? Besides in my orders there is a situation
which I am to destroy the ringworld. Almost none of you will be able to
detect the conditions which fulfill that part of my orders. I am following
my orders to the best of my ability."

"I am fully congizant of my actions, and their implications, and I am
in complete control of my mental condition.  In case you havn\'t noticed,
the entire Imperium is in a state of War.  Crimimal actions are those
actions found unaccepatble by the winners and the writers of history."

At this statement, Etienne\'s eyes narrow and his jaw clenches.  One hand
moves closer to the hilt of his blade and his entire body tenses.

Richard reacts and takes a half step backward, as if struck by Ger\'s
last statement. The passion and heat present just moments ago has
been snuffed out. He stares at Ger with a mixture of utter surprise
and revulsion. His voice is quiet, yet clearly audible and very hard
edged. "Indeed, sir. War precipitated by fools and despots, intoxicated
by power, acting without regard for life, or law, unfettered by such
*PETTY* concerns."

He steps backward, and sits down, heavily, in an empty chair, but with
his unwavering gaze fixed upon Ger. "Sir, I didn\'t come aboard this
mission simply because Rachel Turnskaad asked me to protect her interests.
I came because I saw a chance, a small chance, to reach out and EXPLORE
a WONDROUS world. I thought I would be travelling with likeminded
explorers, yet in you I find the same attitude, the same "winners write
history, so what I do is right" philosophy."

"Fortunately, sir, your compatriots do not agree with you. As for myself,
sir..." Jett is somber and sincere. "...you disgust me."

"I will not be one to be doing the writing of history." counters Ger.
"I\'m only pointing out the way things work in this universe.  As for
\'disgust\', I find little in your chosen profession to drive me to earn
your respect.  How many \'Legal Counsels\' have successfully defended
mass murderers on a technicality such as failure to receive a statement
of rights the the time of their arrest?  Disgust from a man like you
carries little sting."

"I am the Captain of this ship as well as the mission commander.  The
disobeying of my orders also have serious consequences. I don\'t expect
unwavering obedience, nor do I expect my actions to be blocked by my own
crew. Lazer put your weapon away. If none of you will do it, I\'ll just
fire the missile myself."

Judge Jett shakes his head in dismay. "Arbeit macht frei, eh Admiral?"

[Ger\'s finger flicks over the console, and an area changes from some
ship status to a copy of the firing control board].

Etienne\'s voice rings out, "Computer, engage all safety interlocks on
missile turret."

Jan noting that legalistics and negotiations are not going anywhere,
brings his weapon to bear on Admiral Ger.

"Sir, I am placing you under arrest, step away from the console.  Do it
now."

"Fine." states Ger.  "I\'m under arrest. What are the charges and who are
you installing as captain?"

Lazer\'s pistol shifts smoothly to aim at Ger\'s keyboard.

During the whole incident Johann has been sitting silent at his console,
working the sensors and doing his job. A perceptive person on the bridge
would see a slight tension in the muscles of his neck, even though it
doesn\'t reflect in his face.

>From his seat, Richard nods in agreement. He sounds tired. "Thank you,
Doctor Yorblin...." He draws his pistol, verifies its readiness, then
replaces it, as he views the tableau before him.

Rigo stands up, slowly so as not to startle anyone, his hands empty and
held out from his body, neither anyway near either of his guns.

"Commander, I signed up for an exploration party, not a military venture.
Your authority is no greater than any other ship captain\'s. That\'s quite
great, to be sure, but it dosen\'t extend to murder or suicide. Come to
that, even military authority dosen\'t run to murder. You\'re almost certainly
right about the ringworld\'s defenses, but you can\'t be sure. If you try to
launch that missile we will have to try to stop you or become an accessory
to attempted murder or at least reckless endangerment. Besides, you can\'t
be sure of the nature of those defenses. Quite possibly the defense would
extend beyond neutralizing the attack to exterminating the attacker. The
ringworld may treat hostiles rather more harshly than non-hostiles. Don\'t
do it, Commander."

He then moves his right hand down to hower near his stunner holster, but
makes no attempt to draw it.

     Zben has been following all the dialogue very carefully (and has
set up a couple of other small windows on his control board). At this
point he makes direct eye contact with the Commander, and addresses
him in (not perfect) Darrian *"Sir. I have always respected your
people\'s pride and intellect. BUT, the action you contemplate could
have larger effects than the *Maghiz*!*" He continues in Standard.
"Sir. Please. Do we want to be known by these people as undisciplined
savages? We asked the entity to release our vessels from its control.
If you check sensors you\'ll see that is happening. If this entity
wanted to harm us, _we_would_be_dead_by_now! To demonstrate that we
have the capability of harming the Ring is unnecessary." He slowly
sits up very straight in his seat. "Sir. I would not fight violence
with violence," (he glances at the drawn guns, and then returns to
Ger) "but I will do what I deem necessary to either prevent that
missle from launching, or to destroy it as soon as it is launched."
His face twists into a small grin. "Ask any of these fine folk who\'ve
played poker with me. I don\'t bluff..."


 === Alcyon Sickbay ===

So much has happened there, in such a short time, that it is a homecoming
of sorts for the good Doctor. Innumerable physical exams and inoculations,
important not just for raw data, but for that personal touch and intuitive
impression that cannot be quantified. A painful secret revealed, leading to
an intricate, painstaking surgical cure. He can almost feel the sweaty
concentration.

Death. The grim task of the autopsy on colleagues killed by an unseen
saboteur, before he had the chance to know them as personalities and
not merely personnel files. Killed in their sleep, awake, at their post.
Unfortunate and maddening not even to know why. Christian hated that
mystery. The uncertainly robbed the dead and the living alike of the
peace that was due them. Injury. Lives saved, bodies repaired, though
not always returned to normal. Lying side by side in the adjoining
low berth compartment, Christian\'s failures lay in icy repose, silently
mocking his vaunted skill.

A sudden thought roared through Christian\'s mind. Adrian Bishop! The
memory of the discovery, the valiant attempt at help, rejection,
catastrophic failure was still raw and painful. He felt sorrow,
deepening into fundamental regret. His conscience taunted him. *The
high and mighty Doctor, you\'ve got all the answers. Didn\'t have the
answer for Adrian, did you? You meddled, Christian, and destroyed
him. You sure knew what was best for him, didn\'t you. Hah!* A part
of his mind was uneasy about what he might find, once the instant
demand on his time had ceased, and he was forced to confront what,
or who, Adrian had become. Christian forced his mind to turn away
from such nervous, idle speculation.

A life hung in the balance.

For a minute, Christian plays the role of traffic cop. He points to
the adjacent Chief Medical Officer\'s suite. "Triple Three -- Take Doctor
Tweeerrrlll to that cabin. Monitor his condition and alert me to any
significant change. I will review his condition later. Go!" Gesturing
to two patient beds at the port wall of Sickbay, he tells Lucan and
Dulinor, "Install the non-critical crash victims over there. Continue
to monitor, report updates to Sickbay computer. Prepare full medical
report and prioritized treatment protocol." Christian turns away, then
adds an afterthought. "Oh, and go though their gear bags for any
identification. Look for standard medical history datacrystals, or
at least names. Report findings. Carry on, your majesties."

His voice inflection becomes fractionally more urgent. "OSF, put the
trauma patient, there, on that surgical bed." He walks over to the
surgical bay and brings all systems to full readiness for immediate
trauma surgery, muttering disjointed phrases of arcane medical jargon.

Christian looks down at the critically injured stranger, lips pressed
together in urgent concern. The man\'s blood volume had fallen to a
dangerously low level, complicating his wounds and internal injuries
with severe shock.  While Christian concentrated on that stranger, Lucan
and Dulinor continued to minister to the less severely injured strangers
by stabilizing their condition, medicating with painkillers and anti-
infection pharmaceuticals, and conducting intensive scans.

Passing a med-scanner over the injured form, Christian grimly notes that
his condition, while stabilizing, was clearly precarious. The med-computer
beeped insistently, as the latest blood workups and test reports glowed
into existence on its vidscreen, accompanied by a calm computer voice
reading them out for the benefit of the harried doctor. The extent and
severity of the internal injuries indicated that prolonged surgery would
be required to save his life.

Glancing at the overhead holo, Christian pulls up a menu and makes a
number of selections. An integral injector pokes out of an alcove in
the bed, pivots, and silently administers a cocktail of surgical
pharmaceuticals. With one eye monitoring the patient\'s vitals, Christian
taps on a control pad, then reaches down to select his instruments from
the tray that silently appeared.

A high pitched hum begins to emanate from the surgical bay, as the
sterile field forms around the injured human. Poised to begin the
task of rescuing a life, Christian pauses for a second as he activates
the intercom. "Bridge, this is CMO Van Der Merwe. I\'m in Sickbay with
several injured sophonts and treatment is underway. Don\'t ask how, I\'ll
fill you in later. Since I\'m the only Command officer, I guess I\'m the
temporary Alcyon CO, but you have the conn, I won\'t have time to worry
about that now. Just keep me apprised of developments. Out." He turns
back to his patient, and begins his struggle to save a life.


 === Gemini Arbiter ===

Aurelia Xerxes furiously glances back and forth between the sheaf of
contract forms in her hand and the empty corridor which just moments
before contained a glowing archway and a jaunty Vargr.

"WHA... BLOW ARE HEADS OFF!" she exclaims.  "Who does he think he is? I..."

"Now Aurelia." cautions Nichole,  "Calm down. Don\'t get excited."

"Ahem! ..." Aurelia composes herself.  "You\'re right.  Here!"  She thrusts
the papers into Nichole\'s hands and walking towards the bridge.  "You look
over these papers while I fill in Arby and run a systems check."
 
Nichole quickly steps away from the bridge iris and warns, "...I wouldn\'t
walk in there yet!"

As Aurelia thumbs the hatch button, she turns around towards Nichole
and frowns.  "Whaaa...?" and is immediately hit by the leftover anti-
hijack gas from the bridge, "...ACHOO!..."

She paws the door controls and rapidly backs away from the slowly dispersing
cloud of gas.  "Just great! ...ACHOO!... I hate that stuff."

Nichole smirks a little as she chides,  "I warned you!"

As she turns and heads aft towards the lounge, Aurelia mutters, "On second
thought. We\'ll both go over these papers while the bridge is being cleaned."


 === Talisman ===

"Ah-HEM!" The voice from behind Ralf and Redd is firm and a bit
exasperated. "I am very gratified to see you up and around so 
quickly, Ralf, but you DID give us quite a scare." It\'s Doctor
Tabor. "Mind if I have a quick look at you? Won\'t hurt a bit."

"No problem doc, glad to see you again."  Ralf pulls a data crystal
from the handheld at his belt and tosses it to Tabor.  "Here\'s
my medical history and my vital signs for the last hour.  C\'mon down
to engineering and I\'ll start prepping the sensors while you read."


 === Alcyon Bridge ===

"Say WHAT?!" Morgan Grey sits bolt upright in his chair on the Bridge.
"Christian, what, where--" He sputters to a halt and flicks another
switch. "Pater, where\'s Doctor van der Merwe?"

"Doctor van der Merwe is in Sickbay. He has activated sterile procedures
at Trauma Table One and has disengaged communications," the Alcyon\'s
computer replies mildly.

"Gimme internal cameras in Sickbay," Grey snaps. Pater complies, and a
holo of the doctor at work appears on the main tactical screen. Grey
stares at it in disbelief. He\'s still staring when Werner walks in....

"Morgan, you would not believe what I found in-- GOTT IM HIMMEL!" He
rushes over to the holo, loosening his tie and running a hand through
his unruly hair. "That is Doctor van der Merwe! But-- but-- I was THERE
not FIVE MINUTES ago, and the room was EMPTY! Only Bishop--" His eyes
bug out even further. "Something RESTARTED HIS POD!"

"Restarted his...?" Grey\'s eyes narrow. "Pater, are your self-diagnostics
running?"

"Of course, Morgan. Always." Pater sounds a trifle offended.

"Did you restart Adrian Bishop?"

"No."

"Then who DID?!"

"Scanning...scanning...ah!" Pater registers interest and concern. "Here
it is. A rogue process spawned from Subregister F7F73E0040 in the main
bank. It moved through the structure, straight into the cold sleep berth
where Bishop was, and vanished. No other interference noted. If it WAS
a virus of some sort, it was very fastidious about what it touched."

"Huh!" Grey slaps a hand to his forehead. Then he frowns. "Run securecam
in Sickbay back ten minutes and play forward at double speed."

"Here you are." Grey and Werner watch the playback. The door opens, Werner
enters, crosses to Bishop\'s low berth, stares at it. His lips move, he
is obviously shouting. He then backs out of Sickbay and closes the door.
Nothing happens for several moments, then the two watchers on the Bridge
are left agape as the coruscating white flash deposits the good Doctor,
three humans, an Ael Yael (?!), an Aeloid animal of some sort, and three
robots into Sickbay.

"Unglaublich." Werner shakes his head. He looks over at Grey, his eyes
feverish. "Multiple teleport with no momentum-transformismus. Only the
Ancients could do that...."

Grey isn\'t listening. He\'s staring at the holo. Never taking his eyes
off it, he reaches for the comm unit. "Bridge to Security. O\'Shi?"

"Whatcha want, Grey? I was doin\' my nails."

"Stuff a sock in it, Mahlel," Grey orders. "Grab a Gauss Rifle and get
to Sickbay doubletime-- somebody just teleported a WARBOT into our laps!"


 === Paladin ===

Azani, hearing Zar\'s orders, hurries to the bridge.  Moving quickly through
the corridors he heads to where mayhem and tradgedy has struck. Entering
the bridge, he sees Zar and the doctors tending to the still limp body
of Charyn.

Azani looks upon Charyn with a blank unemotional stare. In his line
of business, death was not an option, it was a given. Emotions get in
the way and cloud the thinking process. Emotions made people create
illogical thoughts and mistakes. 

*Just do your duty...* thought Azani as he knelt down beside the doctors.
He had been on the bridge before and had dropped of some medical supplies
so the docs could help Charyn. He had left to find Charyn limp and perhaps
lifeless. *...just another soldier Jordan lost in the fight.*

"Doctors, I\'m here to assist you in anyway I can. I don\'t have any
medical experience but I\'m willing to try." He places some of the other
equipment that he was gathering next to the blankets and medical kits
he had gathered earlier. He then takes the helmet of his combat armor
and waits for a reply.


 === Talisman ===

"Always too bloody busy for the Doctors," Tabor grouses as he pops
the crystal into his hand computer. As he chases Ralf down the 
corridors, he casts a pleading eye over his shoulder at Redd.

"Harrumph. OCG steady except for some thready bits at the end; blood
pressure stable throughout; no evidence of trauma; EEG-- WHOA!" He
looks up at Ralf\'s back, careens off a corner, and chases after him,
waving the hand computer like a subpoena. "RALF, GET BACK HERE! I
have to doublecheck this EEG scan! I\'ll bring the equipment down
to Engineering, but you HAVE to let me do this!"

Kimball Redd glances round -

"Hi doctor, try not to keep him long, engineering seems to be horribly
busy on this trip - I\'ve been in quieter battles!"


 === Trakh ===

Aolrkhea\' finishes whispering a few short phrases into her throat
commdot and nods as she finishes her conference with Aiwi, the
_Khaurl_, and Fa\'eairl.  She turns to face the Admiral.

"Sir, our pinpoint densitometer map of the interior of starship ID
_Talisman_ is being processed by Fa\'eairl now -- I will display it
on the central holotank at your command.  Hwa\'ahel is preparing the
internal scan of starship ID _Paladin_ for immediate relay.

Akhouw leans back in his command chair, surveying the display of the
human ships with an experienced eye. "Hrmmmmmm..." The throaty rumble
is a clue to his thoughtful analysis, as his dewclaw slowly taps a
martial rhythm on the chair\'s arm. As he expected, nothing out of
the ordinary; still, such information was never irrelevant when the
future was unclear. When his eyes survey the readout on the _Paladin_,
he sits up slightly, then relaxes into his typical pose of serene
confidence.

"Admiral, might we extend an offer of assistance to the fiyfiyalr?
They seem to be having great difficulties with their engineering
subsystems.  Perhaps we could aid them in some way.  It might help
smooth our relations with them, as well.  And perhaps we might discover
what their problem is, and whether it threatens us."

Akhouw closes his eyes and meditates for an areiaao. The answer, as it
should, was best found by attention to haaealri (balance). His eyes
opened as the command chair rotated towards Aolrkhea\'\'s duty station.

"Your suggestion is apt, Aolrkhea\'. Open a lasercom channel to the..."
His eyes shift to the holotank then back to her. "... Aurora. Their
systems have failed twice, perhaps the problem is worst there. Inquire
as to the source of their problems and offer our assistance." His
expression lightens. "Remember that they are fiyfiyalr, and strive for
haaealri. Some humans are less familiar with Aslan, and require your
tolerance..."

She turns back to her console and glances down as a blue tell-tale
begins to flash on the densitometer status panel.  She continues to 
assist Aiwi as she reports.            

"Gravitic systems aboard the disabled fiyfiyalr vessels seem to be 
returning to normal function now.  Interference is returning on all
bands on the densitometer."


 === Alcyon Sickbay ===

There was a feeling of light haze and a sense of deja vu... then the
pain made its presence known. Tiblisi\'s head felt better than before,
but it still felt like it had been smashed open and glued back
together again... and the glue hadn\'t had time to set yet.

Memories began flashing back and forth... a bright flash, dry air,
brief memories of jump, trying to get out of a crash couch, impact,
getting the mess ready for dinner, finishing the Purser\'s log, moving
being thrown against the bulkhead, darkness, tumbling, and a bright
light.  Everything seemed mixed together and out of sequence. Then
more memories -- being in the cargo terminal getting a ship loaded for
lift, the sound of a crane traversing overhead with a huge crate, the
sound of splintering material, then crashes, then an explosion, then
screams, then the pain...

Tiblisi\'s sits bolt upright with eyes open wide in panic, looking
straight up. *No, this isn\'t the terminal. That was so long ago...* 

The sudden movement brings dizziness, a wave of nausea, and more pain
to the side of Tiblisi\'s head. With a groan, Lee takes several deep
breaths and then things begin to fall into place -- the attack, the
concussion, the misjump, abandoning the ship and crashing here. Lee
takes several more deep breaths and the pain receeds a bit. *What an
atrocious stench!* Several more deep breaths and Lee\'s eyes begin to
focus. The pain continues but it is bearable. Lee gingerly moves
each limb -- the right arm is numb, but everything seems to work.
*Well, it can\'t get any worse.*

Lee\'s eyes focus more. *I\'m in an infirmary on whatever planet this
is. That helps.* There is someone -- a passenger -- on the table to
the left. Unconscious, but with regular breathing and no apparent
major injuries. *Well, I\'m in no condition to do Basic Aid -- not that
that would help -- and there is probably another doctor here to help
anyway. Relax, things will be fine.* 

Turning to the right... "It\'s worse...". A doctor is operating on
someone -- by the telltale yellow hair, the passenger in B7 -- and 
also several robots. The stench continues to grow. Looking down, 
gore covers Lee\'s jumpsuit. *Things are definitely worse* Lee then sees
that one of the robots assisting in the operation is a warbot. *Great.*

"Things are much worse..." Dizziness returns and Lee falls back on
the table with a soft thud. The tender spot on the back of Lee\'s head
flares with pain on contact with the table. "Oh, Geezz..." 

*Maybe there isn\'t another doctor available. I didn\'t *see* anyone else,
and the only one I did see is busy.  He\'ll get to whoever\'s next when
there\'s time, and I can\'t do more than pass out again anyway - I think.
All I need is something for the dizziness and remnant of the concussion,
and then help with a long, hot shower.  Maybe the shower first -- the
stench is horrible...*


 === Alcyon Deck 1A ===

O\'Shi Mahlel has been described by some of those working with him as 
"An attitude with legs." He does his job with a sneer and an unspoken
addendum that things would be smoother if HE were giving the orders.
Having the Alcyon to himself was a Godsend-- no eyepatched fruitcake
or stogie-chomping butthead telling him what to do, no duty roster,
no nothing. He was was all set to settle into a nice routine of sitting
around and drinking beer....

The corridors in the Alcyon are LONG. It takes several mintues to get
somewhere, even at a dead run, and that\'s what O\'Shi is doing, with
his Gauss rifle in hand and his Bermudas riding up. He doesn\'t want
to THINK about Grey watching him on the monitors, nothing on but a 
T-shirt and Bermuda shorts and socks....

He hits his commdot as he skids to a halt at the door to Sickbay. 
"If this is some kinda joke, Morgan, I\'m gonna kick your ugly Scout
keister from here to next week!" He palms the door open.


 === Alcyon Sickbay ===

*Oh my head and neck!* thinks Berana.  *Ugh, where am I, what is all this
stuff? I suppose I could try and open my eyes?*

After forcing blood encrusted eyes open, Tar finally gets a sense of where
he is *sickbay...robots?, noseplugs...*

Tar tries to look a bit more but his neck is too stiff to move.  He does
manage to see what he hopes is a doctor operating on that Red-something
guy from the ship.  Ship attacked, lifeboat, pilot screams? Tar mumbles
"Last time ... fly Tukera."

=====================================================

 === Alcyon Sickbay ===

After a short while, the pain-killers begin to take effect and Tiblisi
begins to feel better. 

*I feel better. I know I\'m not better, but at least I feel that way.
Well, I\'m beginning to get some feeling back into my right arm. It
hurts like its beat with a cargo lash, but at least its feeling.* 

There is a bit of movement from the couch to the left. 

*It looks like someone else is coming around.* 

Tiblisi glances back to the right to see how the doctor is doing.
Even without fully focused eyes, it\'s obvious the doctor is moving
fast -- and muttering something -- "...get out of my way..." -- as
he maneuvers around the innards of... of...

*My memories not usually this bad. What IS that guy\'s name? I\'ll
remember.* 

Aburptly, the mechanized arsenal pivots and moves behind Tiblisi.
After a brief moment of anxiety, there is the sound of a door opening
and closing. Tiblisi lies back and begins to relax when...

The infimary door opens and some security-type walks in like he
owns the place.

*They think they own every place...*

Then he starts screaming at the doctor and true to form, begins waving
a rifle around. 

O\'Shi\'s jaw drops. "What the screaming blue fuck...? Uh, I mean HI doc!"
He takes a hesitant step into the Sickbay, looking around him and
gun ready. "Where\'s this, uh, WARBOT? And who ARE these people? And--"
His voice instantly rises to a yell. "--Where the FUCK did you come from?!"

*Security types, sergents, and chief petty officers just love to yell.*
thinks Lee.  *Wait a minute... what is he doing with a rifle in an infirmary?
What kind of a place is this? Either this is a base infirmary, or I\'m not
planet-bound anymore. Great... Wonderful... Don\'t say a thing, Lee.  Just
shut-up and watch what\'s going on. With all that\'s going on in this sector,
who knows? You don\'t want to offend someone who is keeping you alive.* 

On the adjacent bio-bed, Tarmine Berana is having similar thoughts.
*Where now?   Hmm, more screaming, security type in my face, the calm one
must be a doctor.  Cleanup, drink, miss...  I don\'t think I\'m dying.
Who beat me up?  Why me?*

"liquid?"


 === Paladin ===

Morser replies, "Ach, GUT! Herr Azani, chust whom I am lookink for! 
Pleease take Frau Rrobins to her cabin unt strap her into her bunk.
Ve seem to be in a crrrizis situvation right now, unt stepping on
her vould NOT speed her recovery in any vay shape or Vvorrm."

Satisfied that he\'s being obeyed, Morser turns back to the datadisplays.
"IASIC," he whimpers. "Please come back! Kommen sie zuruck! Bitte schon!
Bitte schon mit ZUCKER! ACH!" He begins flipping through the computer
menus. "Vhere ze hell is zat communications zetup?! It iss about Time
I gave Herr Dummkopf Ger a piece of my mind-- he could USE it!"


 === Talisman ===

"Hm... computer, open sessions on displays four and five, sensory
data from incoming transmissions on displays two and three.  Call up file
archives Gamma_7500.ecm to Gamma_8500.ecm and Delta_7500.nav to Delta_8500.
nav for statistical analysis.  Execute command now."

"Bridge, this is Ralf in engineering.  Sorry, I stepped out earlier
to deal with our visitor.  I\'m currently engaged in analyzing data
gathered since our jump in.  I may need access to the sensor equipment;
can I have an open line to the comm officer\'s dataserver?  Hm... I\'m going
to be taking a look at the specs for the equipment here as well..."

Thul replies from the Bridge, "Go ahead with the sensors Ralf! All stations!
Report status!" 


 === Trakh ===

While Khea\' runs densitometer scans, Aiwi concentrates on the other
passive scans, occassionally dumping data to Khaurl by tight beam
laser-com and receiving similar transmissions.  Her first priority
is a PasEngScan from Trakh to Kingfisher.  She then completes passive
scans of Kingfisher, and moves to Paladin, then Talisman, and so on
until passive scans on all ships (except the phin shuttle) are complete.
Her dewclaw reflexively extends ever-so-slightly as she works with almost
frightening intensity to get every last byte of information she can in the
time allotted.  She continues to monitor communications, but solely by ear
while her hands are busy. 

Having configured her displays for optimal efficiency, Aiwi continues
to scan incoming sensor data on the fiyfiyalr ships and monitor
intership communications over her earpiece, as she routes a copy of
the incoming sensor data to one of Akhouw\'s boards.  "Sensor data
incoming to your display now, Admiral."  Her hands move to adjust a
window on her board as the Admiral orders her to predict the wreck\'s
course, note probable impact sights, compute the possibility of
survivors, and determine the cause of the damage to the wreck.  All of
these tasks she attempts to accomplish with the smallest possible
delay. She begins performing active scans on the wreck to analyze the
damage patterns and enlists the computational aid of Fa\'eairl.  She
reports whatever the highest probability match is to the Admiral as
soon as she has it.


 === Gemini Arbiter ===

Aurelia swivels in her chair and gets up from the table where the Turnskaad
contract papers were spread out.  Stretching, she tells Nichole,  " You
finish here. I\'m going to the bridge. It should be bearable by now."

Walking onto the bridge, she eases into a crash couch.

"Arby, run a systems check."  As the Arbiter\'s computer completes it\'s
self-diagnostics, she comments, "Looks good. Okay. Now scan the area.
Lets see what\'s been happening."

Nichole steps through the hatch.

"Well, it looks to be a standard contract." she advises her sister.  "Nothing 
fancy.  I\'ve rechecked our data on Turnskaad.  From what our records show,
they seem to be the typical meduim sized company.  Obviously no mention of
this expedition.  They\'ve had dealings with SDS before and our parent megacorp.
Standard stuff.  The only problem I see is that we are currently employed
by Turnskaad through SDS.  Which would make signing this contract superfluous.

"Yeah," agrees Aurelia, "but this wasn\'t in our original contract. Wouldn\'t
it interfere with it?"

"Did you ever look closely at our contracts?" asks Nikki.  "They\'ve all had
some statement of exception included. We are given quite a bit of lattitude
in the execution of our duties, you know!"

"Oh yeah!" retorts Aurelia.  "That same latitude could get us canned, too!"

"Yes." Nichole replies,  "But how many times have we really been reprimanded?!
I can remember several instances where we used it to our advantage!"

"Oh, you\'re right." sighs Aurelia.  "I can remember a few too. But still...
Okay. Let\'s sign the damn thing. I think it would be better if we did. It
might make THEM feel better if we did, too!"

"Besides," adds Nichole, "think of it this way. They might get in trouble
if they didn\'t help us! You never know how important that cargo is we\'re
carrying."

A chime sounds as Arby finishes the scan ordered a few minutes earlier.
Turning from Nichole, Aurelia swings back to face the console.

"Let\'s see what the scanning shows.  Whoa! Things have changed quite a
bit since the last time."

Sitting down at her, Nichole punches into the adjacent console.

"Look there! The Kingfisher has powered up her weapons systems!"

"Has anyone else?" asks Aurelia.

Nichole brings up the relevant data.  "Doesn\'t look like it."

"What\'s his name?" ponders Aurelia.  "Ger. I wonder what he\'s trying to do?
What\'s the Aslan doing?"

"Nothing so far."  Then Nichole points to another part of the display. 
"And there!  That ship from R-Alpha has just about docked with the Westwind."

Aurelia exclaims, "Huh? That must be some ship!"  Glancing at the rest of
the display, she continues, "Looks like we wait a while before we transmit
the contract. Since they\'ve powered up their weapons I don\'t think they\'re
to concerned with legal documents right now!"

"Maybe we should call them?" suggests Nichole.

"I don\'t think so." counter Aurelia.  "Let\'s see what happens first."


 === R-Alpha ===

Grob the Kyth, fleeing madly from the alien vision he\'d just been
subjected to, glances behind him and sees the frightening flying-thing
zooming after him above the trees. They are following me to the
Gathering, he realizes suddenly. I am betraying the Kythui by leading
their enemies to them!

With that thought comes action. Grob heels his mount hard to the left
and takes off at right angles to his previous course....

Upon noticing the R-Alphan native changing his direction of travel, Hryawi
instructs Hfolraw to plot another intercept.  Hfolraw continues to drive
the Aslan speeder in a straight line for a short time, then quickly replots
another course which will cross ahead of his prey, and cutting off the
escape.  Moving the speeder low through the trees, Hfolraw scans for a
clearing in the thick brush, looking for a spot several hundred meters
in front of the Kyth, far enough ahead to avoid detection until it is too
late.  The scientist will have her specimen, thinks Hfolraw.  It\'s only
a matter of time.


 === Trakh ===

>From Aiwi\'s station, where she is currently monitoring sensors and
communications, Aiwi speaks in her usual terse, professional manner,
but perhaps a handful of decibels above normal, due in part to the
sudden flurry of activity on sensors and in part because she wants to
make sure she is heard.  Her voice barely modulates, with the sole
exception of a deferential drop in pitch when she uses the only title
that commands her unfailing respect, "New sensor contact, Admiral."
Her hands move swiftly over instruments so familiar she knows them by
touch, as she continues, "Object on the far side of the ringworld,
approximately 2 AU from us.  Approximately 1,000 displacement tons...
in a slow decaying orbit.  Some heat registering, but not evenly
distributed... secondary radiation leakage consistent with containment
failure of a ship\'s power plant... VLS shows it to be a starship hull,
*badly* damaged... by high velocity impacts or explosions on hull
surface... unable to match hull with certainty; highest probablility
is a Tukera type RT LongLiner... a ship that would carry a crew of 14
and up to 36 passengers.  Sir."

In the midst of reviewing the course tracks of the variety of ships in near
proximity to the _Trakh_, Akhouw\'s ears twitch in surprise. He politely
acknowledges Aiwi\'s report, then shifts the course track to a corner of
his HUD and calls up a full display of the new contact. After a brief
look, he touches the controls. The combined EMS image of the liner grows
in size to fill nearly the whole HUD, as Akhouw gets a comprehensive view,
from stem to stern.

When he is finished, a decisive stab of his claw clears the liner image
and resumes his close watch on the variety of ships in the vicinity. "Aiwi,
predict wreck course and note probable impact sites; compute possibility
of survivors. Continue analysis of damage pattern and attempt to specify
cause. Use active scan as required."


 === Alcyon Sickbay ===

When O\'Shi bursts upon the scene, Christian is well into the early stages
of the trauma surgery, staunching the worst of the internal bleeding
and preparing to repair the major organ damage. Sparing O\'Shi only a
moment\'s glance, he continues the operation with unabated precision and
commendable speed, as his hands and eyes cooperate in a deft surgical
ballet. His voice is cool and measured, although a close listener would
detect the undercurrent of irritation at the rude interruption.

"My apologies for my unconventional arrival, O\'Shi, but I couldn\'t wait
for a taxi." He checks the med-holo, then turns to the trauma bay controls
and orders a supplemental dosage of anarad, to take care of minor radiation
exposure, and hyronaline, to boost blood resupply. The vital signs were
firming up well, as the drugs began to take hold. Christian released a
very small sigh of relief, before resuming his ... dialogue with his
unwelcome visitor.

"...and hello as well. My patients here are the victims of some sort
of spacecraft crash, I\'m not exactly sure myself where they\'re from."
In the midst of reattaching a swarm of severed blood vessels, Christian
begins to program a host of nanocytes to handle a variety of very delicate
regenerative chores. "...They came to me, and I to the Alcyon, by way of
the Ringworld, or Hoop as some call it. Created by the Ancients, I believe,
and gifted with the ability to teleport people and equipment." He favors
O\'Shi with a sidelong glance. "You can contact it, if you have a problem,
I believe it\'s on 1337.45 Mhz."

"The, ah, warbot you\'ve noticed is the property of Doctor Tweeerrrlll, whom
we rescued off of the Bernoulli. It\'s called OSF-4, and is currently in
my cabin, assisting in the care of his owner, one of my patients as well."

Suddenly, Christian notices the gauss rifle that O\'Shi is waving about the
Sickbay. He sharply orders, "Mahlel, put that rifle away, dammit, before I
implant it up your colon. There\'s nothing here for Security to get paranoid
about." He glares at O\'Shi. "And stop screaming your head off in Sickbay --
got it?" He turns back to his patient, muttering about peace and quiet.

As the doctor yells at O\'Shi, Tiblisi just lies back further into the
couch and tries not to be noticed.

O\'Shi glares at the Doctor, and blurts, "Implant it up my--" His jaw
shuts with a snap like a steel trap as he sees that van der Merwe is
now pointedly ignoring him. He looks around the room, hitching up his
Bermuda shorts with a free hand, then makes a noise somewhere between
a sigh and a fart.

*O\'Shi could use some attitude adjustment, as always. Never understand
how such a bullying slob got hired for this ticket.* A part of Christian\'s
mind muses while the remainder is otherwise engaged. His hands reached
for a spray applicator of stimgen, a potent regrowth stimulator. *It
was a mistake to include him on the Alcyon roster. Typically, his sort
of personality required close supervision, else the freedom might go to
his swelled head.*

His mind subconsciously notes O\'Shi\'s adjustment. *Crude, as always, but he
does know where his brains are.* His mind laughs. His hands switch between
instruments, the nerve fusor replacing the spray applicator. The patient was
responding well to the surgery, Christian noted. Hormonal reponses were
near optimal, and the holoscan indicated the tide of trauma was slowly
receding; the repair of the internal organ damage remained the critical
task. The surgery continued.


 === Trakh ===

A moment of silence passes on the bridge of the _Trakh_ as the results
from the first set of sensor scans are analysed by Aiwi and Aolrkhea\',
with the assistance of the computer.  Schematics, estimates, and targeting
information begin to appear on various monitors, holotanks, and HUDs
around the Bridge.  On the tactical plot, a new marker appears for the
apparent derelict at extreme range.

Akhouw intently studies the shifting tactical readouts and holotank images.
His internal tension is only visible in the unbidden extension of his
dewclaw. Meditatively, he scratches his chin with his right dewclaw.

The brief spell is broken when Aolrkhea\' whispers into her throat commdot.
"Fa\'eairl.  Begin EMS/IR scans, control at my station.  Status."

The computer\'s soft female voice emanates from the commdot.  _Densitometer
analysis continuing.  Radio traffic anaylsis complete.  I stand ready._

The status alert sounds again.  Aolrkhea\' glances at the screen and touches
a button on her panel.  "Hwa\'ahel.  Ship _Aurora_ is now also off-line.
Perform densitometer scan, high priority."  She shakes her head slightly.
"Admiral, relativistic calculations indicate that the systems on ship
_Aurora_ failed simultaneously with the others, as if by FTL communication.

Akhouw frowns slightly, as a low growl indicates his interest in this odd
fact.

"Fa\'eairl," continues Aolrkhea\', "Play the results of traffic analysis back
on by earpiece, at compressed speed."

Briefly waiting for results, she looks at her visual scan.  The green band
of the far side of the ring now dominates the image, white cotton streams
of clouds visibly above the fields and glittering water of the structure,
the snow bands on the mountainous spill walls blinding in their glare.
*Yes, truly a layeaueakh,* she thinks quietly.  *Who was it that composed 
"Yoyeaokhtef for a Ringworld"?  Ah, I remember, it was Hkyoei.*

The alert sounds again.  "Admiral, ship _Gemini Arbiter_ has also shut down."
She immediately sets up the densitometer to scan the vessel.  Suddenly, she
cocks her head, listening to the ongoing playback.  *Teleport?!*  Aolrkhea\'
shoots a look over at Aiwi\'s station.  Aiwi is completely engrossed in the
operation of her sensor suite, her hands playing the console like the 
consummate artist she is.

"Admiral Akhouw.  I think you should hear this on the main speaker.  These
are Aiwi\'s radio interceptions on frequency 1337.45 Mhz, beginning about
tea areiaao before I reported to the bridge."

A calm human male voice floats out of the bridge speaker.
"Iasic has been mildly chastised and will not improve your systems
beyond this without your permission."

Then Ger\'s voice is heard.
    "To the sophont at 1337.45 Mhz, Please Identify yourself.  If you
have any control over the Iasic personality, please instruct it to
disengage itself from all our systems. I consider its actions to be
quite disruptive, and irregular." "We have the coordinates, I am quite
confident that my personnel can get us there without any difficulty or
assistance".

Aolrkhea\' touches her panel.  "And tea areiaao teakheh later, this."

The same calm human male voice speaks again.
    "I am this world, which turns below you.  I had not expected visitors
at this time, but I welcome you nevertheless.
    "I apologize for the apprehension that IASIC has caused you.  His
efforts were intended to be of a beneficial nature.  He will remove
himself from your systems immediately."

As the communications intercept continues to play, Akhouw\'s face reflects
his increasing surprise. "Most illuminating...." is his initial comment.
After a moment\'s thought, he turns to Aolrkhea\'. "Query the _Aurora_ as
to their contact with the Iasic construct and if this is related to their
engineering difficulty."

Aolrkhea\' cuts in.  "I think this next voice is an Ael Yael, an avian
species from Gushemege sector.  He sounds quite weak."

Tweel\'s voice plays back.
"Attention, Rrring, thiss iss the ISSss Aurrorra on 1337.45, you have
jussst ssent uss thrree patientss.  We rrequessst inforrrmation on
theirr injurrriess *IMMEDIATELY*.  Alssso, we rrequessst that you
possibly teleporrt, them, theirr sssurgeon and hiss equipment to the
Alssseyon wherre betterr equipment iss available.  *PLEASSE!!!!* Every
pico-sssecond is the Grreat Hunterr\'s weapon!"

While his face reflects increased surprise and interest, his comment is
a laconic "Kai! (Indeed!)". His face relaxes into a more thoughtful,
concerned pose. "Further query _Aurora_ regarding origin of those
patients. Request further information regarding possible link to liner
wreck. Suggest that sharing of data is to our mutual benefit and that
we are willing to reciprocate." He glances at Aolrkhea. "Understood?"

He returns his gaze to the holotank. "Teleport!" he mutters. "Truly this
is a strange time, when one may confront what seems to some as the magic
of the tai\'ao. Yet now, as ever, the wise counsel of taro is heeded."


 === Talisman ===

"Aye aye, Cap\'n, full scan coming up.  Hoist the mizzenmast and
batten down the hatches!  Er, or something like that..."  Ralf starts 
accessing the sensor data and running passive scans on the entire Ring
system.  "Let\'s see... I wonder if we\'ve all been so busy looking at the
Ring, we\'ve overlooked something else?"

Ralf considers for a moment, then preps a query packet and sends it
to the sensor suites on the other expedition ships - except for the 
Kingfisher (according to his logs Ger gave orders to all ships to drop
the Kingfisher from the Turnskaad datasphere).

Shortly after Ralf\'s message, control of ships sensors starts to
be incrementally diverted from the bridge to engineering.  First,
control of the phase-array sensor guidance is tranferred, then
one commo channel after another is re-routed, slowly removing
all sensor control from the bridge and transferring aft.


 === Paladin ===

Azani picks up Charyn\'s limp body and carts her down the hall toward her
stateroom.  She\'s not too heavy, being somewhat slim.  Charyn\'s unconcious
eyes open to slits, but with no apparent awareness behind them.  She drools
on Azani\'s shoulder as he places her in her bunk.  He buckles her in.

As he is about to turn to leave, he hears a slurp of inhaled breath, her
eyes flutter wide open, the lids press together against the light and
motion, then reopen tentatively.  They\'re a cloudy mottled green, the
color of sludge in a sewage treatment plant.  She mumbles thickly but
with surprising volume "wha... hello?".

She tries to sit up and discovers the restraint, puzzled.  Her dark
hands reach alongside and unbuckle the restraint.  She tries to sit up
again, winces, and lays back down.  She reaches gently up to her head
with both hands and places them softly, palm flat against her temples.
She clearly pronounces a profound, genuine, and thoughtful "Owwwww...".

"Whoever\'s there - got anything for a headache?"
 

 === Alcyon Sickbay ===

O\'Shi stalks over to the wall, lowering the rifle and muttering over and
over like a mantra, "DON\'T beat ass on medical personnel. DON\'T beat
ass on medical personnel. DON\'T beat--" He punches the intercom button
savagely.

"Bridge, this is Mahlel. I don\'t know how you did this, Grey, but when
I find out I\'m gonna KICK yer ass. It\'s the Doc all right...." He
shoots a glance over his shoulder, and if looks could maim, van der
Merwe would need crutches. "Same high-minded talk, same snotty
attitude."

"ME?!" Grey rubs his eyes. "Why the hell is this MY fault all of a
sudden?"

"Because you\'re *handy*, asshole. And I CAN\'T yell at HIM, he\'s BUSY."

As O\'Shi walks beyond the field of view and begins yelling at someone
named Grey, Tiblisi thinks, *There\'s no one else here. Must be through
an intercom.*

Despite his intense concentration upon the trauma surgery, the acuity of
Christian\'s hearing is unimpaired. His eyes quickly stab at O\'Shi, sharply
narrowing in a "later for you" gesture, likely missed by the obtuse yet
amusingly attired security team member. \'Vouf, were he present, would
unerringly note the breathing pattern and altered body chemistry warning
of Christian\'s slow burn.

"What\'s he doing? From the securecam shots it looks like he\'s doing a
whole-colon transplant with no donor....yuck...." Grey sounds queasy.

"He\'s up to his elbows in somebody\'s guts." O\'Shi glances at the
operating table. "Not one of ours, though the Mohawk could belong to
Doc Yarbles. Looks like a crash victim, either that or he tried to
fire an FGMP without combat armor. I\'ll check out the other cases."

"Yeah, okay. Just watch out for that Warbot, okay? Bridge out."

"WHAT warbot?" O\'Shi sneers. "You\'re imagining things, Grey. Security
out." He slings the Gauss rifle over his shoulder and saunters over to
the two nearby treatment tables. He wrinkles his nose at the two forms
lying on the tables. "Geesh, whatta mess. We should probably slot these
two before they rot any further. Mebbe we can feed \'em to \'Vouf."

In a low breath, Tiblisi begins to mutter,"Slot..." *Shut up Lee. Your
mouth will get you into serious trouble one of these days. Besides,
you\'re a Purser now not a Deck Hand. You have to watch yourself.  Well,
wait until your healthy again, and then we\'ll see who\'s going to slot
who. Years of working cargo did you some good.*

O\'Shi snickers, then suddenly catches himself and shuts up. With a guilty 
look over his shoulder at van der Merwe, he tiptoes over to the CMO\'s
cabin door, following the spots of blood on the deck. "Somebody crawling
away...?"

O\'Shi continues to provide fuel for Christian\'s intensifying slow burn. At
the crack about \'Vouf, Christian\'s nostrils flare and he stabs another
glance at O\'Shi. Normally a mild man, Doctor Van Der Merwe is clearly
reaching the summit of an otherwise mountain of patience, yet his surgery
is unaffected, continuing on with deft precision and speed.

Suddenly, O\'Shi appears in Tiblisi\'s field of vision, as he steps between
the two bio-beds headed for Christian\'s cabin.  Then O\'Shi walks out of
view, and there is the whoosh of a door opening.

*This is going to be good*, thinks Lee. 

The door slides open, and O\'Shi finds himself face to face with OSF-4.
He starts back, one hand reflexively grabbing for an absent sidearm,
then halts. Another mantra: "DON\'T try ta outdraw a Warbot. DON\'T try
ta outdraw a Warbot." He lowers his hands. SLOWLY.

He frowns for a moment, as if he\'s having trouble deciding on
something.  Then, with a grunt of disgust, he unslings the rifle and
puts it against the wall. He grabs a portable trauma kit from the rack
on the wall, and strides into the cabin. Doctor van der Merwe can only
hear his voice.

"Hey Doc," yells O\'Shi. "Ya know you\'ve got a Ale-Yale bleeding ta death
all over yer bunk?  These little guys is kinda flimsy..."

*I\'ve seen an Ale-Yael before.* thinks Lee. *Don\'t let them hear you say
that.*

"Okay, sport," mutters O\'Shi, "let\'s have a lookitcha-- hey! Hey, Warbot!
Make yerself useful, okay? G\'wan out ta the supply server, and thaw six
units of synthetic plasma, ah, lessee, Type Three works on these guys,
we should have some in stock if the people who stockt this place got
any sense. Lessee now--UGH! Better make that TEN units.  C\'mahn, c\'mahn!
Y\'wannim ta bleed ta death?  Stoopid gahdamn machine.  Lessee now, anti-
infective, check, clotting factor, check, suture-dissolve, check, suturegun,
check, biomonitor, check.  Ster\'lize the hands, check. Gloves, check.
Filter mask, chmmph. Bmmphl gmmph wmmphl gmmph mummph...."

Lee spends the next few moments trying to decide whether to breathe
deep to reduce the headache or shallow to avoid the stench of the
gore covering the jumpsuit. The guy on the other couch moves some
more.

*Looks like I\'ll have someone to talk to soon...*


 === Trakh ===

On the outer hull of the _Trakh_, a single lasercom unit swivels out of
its rest position and activates.  At the speed of light, carefully tuned
and modulated photons shine toward the distant _Aurora_.

Almost three areiaao (45 seconds) later, the laser from _Trakh_ sweeps
the hull of the _Aurora_.  After some delay, it finally finds and locks
on to the ship\'s laser reciever unit.

Holographic static solidifies into an image of a Aslan female officer
of late middle age, wearing a ship\'s uniform in Khaukeairl clan colors
which identifies her as a mid-level naval officer and a physician-scientist
(for those who can read the insignia).

She speaks, in flawless Rim Galanglic.  "This is Khaukeairl Space Navy
vessel Trakh to ISS Aurora, Executive Lieutenant Aolrkhea\' speaking on
behalf of Admiral AkhouwTra\'Ekhaul.  We have observed that your vessel
has been undergoing severe difficulties.  Do you require assistance of
any kind?  We will stand by for your response.  Over."  The figure
freezes, showing that the transmission remains open but not active.

There is a pause for a few areiaao.  "Aurora, this is Trakh.  We understand
that you have had contact with the Iasic construct, and request to know if
it is the cause of your recent problems.  We also understand that you seem
to have some injured persons aboard.  Are they from the liner wreck?  We
have medical personnel aboard who have training in emergency care for 
humans and other non-Aslan sophonts.  We understand any reservations that
you might have toward our offer, but we are fully willing to share our
data with you on equal terms.  We continue to stand by.  Over."


 === Alcyon Sickbay ===

With a masterful and award-winning effort, Christian musters his professional
discipline to withstand the further gibe of O\'Shi. When the aural message
that O\'Shi is attempting first aid finally fights its way past the clog of
traffic on the neural highways, Christian\'s head snaps up and he stares at
his cabin in disbelief. Good intentions aside, Mahlel had no medical training,
much less xenomedical experience. He wasn\'t going to trust his friend to a
paint-by-numbers utterly green rookie with his first canvas.

Lucan floated over in response to Christian\'s summons. It silently hovered
and accepted its orders. "Lucan, go into my cabin. O\'Shi Mahlel will be
administering medical treatment to Doctor Tweel. You are to observe the
procedure and CLOSELY monitor Tweel\'s condition. You are to alert me
IMMEDIATELY if you detect improper treatment that poses a risk to the
patient. Feed your data to the sickbay \'puter. Go!" A moment is spent
in creation of a choice invective, then Christian sets up a small holo off
to the side of the trauma bay in order to keep an eye on Tweel.

*I need to get a drink of water* thinks Tiblisi.  *My mouth feels like
rats have nested in it for a year or two, and my thoat feels raw.  Still,
it\'s not as bad as the... fragrance... I\'ve acquired.* 

Resuming his delicate surgery, Christian\'s nose wrinkles as he finally
notices the stench wafting from the two gore-soaked patients at the far
wall. A nudge activates the intercom. "Pater, increase ventilation to
Sickbay and release scent neutralizer into the airflow."

He turns to talk to Dulinor. "Use a sonic seperator and remove as much
of that... gore coating those patients as you can. Keep them sedated
and stabilized until I can get there." He glances back at his patient,
gauging the extent of his progress, then back to Dulinor. "I won\'t be
much longer here, you will finish closure when I\'m done, then I\'ll
work on those two there..." He looks daggers at the cabin wall. "...
assuming Mahlel is out of my hair."

Tiblisi sess one of the robots move towards the bed and inspect the
bags at the foot of each one. It then began attaching some form of laser
scapel to one of its appendages and begin to make some adjustments.
After inspecting the bags, the robot speaks in an oddly familiar voice.

Perhaps disconcertingly, the voice of Archduke Dulinor is heard in Sickbay,
albeit with a vagely robotic tone. "Doctor Van Der Merwe, the gear bags of
these patients do not contain medical records, but proper nomenclature is
indicated; Lee Tiblisi (Medbay Two) and Tar Berana (Medbay Three). Their
origin is not indicated at this time." A monitor beeps softly; Dulinor
pivots to scan the two.

"Doctor Van Der Merwe, both patients are exhibiting increased neurological
and motor activity. Predict both conscious within... 15.807 seconds." Nearly
on cue, Lee and Tar try to sit up and mumble, respectively. Dulinor notes
their movement. "Both patients are now conscious, Doctor. Possibly coherent.
Instructions?"

*I damned well coherent* thinks Lee.  *Berana... Berana... That\'s right.
The passenger in cabin C-2.  As for instructions, get me cleaned up, a
glass of water, and a stack of twenty credit chits while you\'re at it.
I could have really used something like you on _Glory_ before the hard
times.* 

Lee tries to ask for something to drink, but only a light croak comes
out. Suddenly there is a fresh aroma that, because of the prolonged
lack of food, makes Lee\'s mouth water. *Well, that helps my throat
a bit.* With the saliva, Lee swallows and most of the rawness fades
away. 

Christian looks over at the pair. "Maintain pre-treatment protocol and
monitoring. Advise of further developments." He checks his own patient,
then glances at Tweel\'s monitor. "I\'m nearly done here." His vocal volume
increases slightly, as his tone becomes almost cheerful. "Welcome to
the Alcyon, gentlemen, my name is Christian Van Der Merwe. I\'ll be with
you shortly."

"No problem, Doc," rasps Tiblisi. "Take your time. I don\'t think I
have any pressing engagements at the moment." 


 === Paladin ===

Azani, just about leave, notices Charyn move a little and gurgle. He
then turns and approaches her.

"Lay still Ms. Robins, I\'ll get the doctors, they\'ll be pleased along
with Zar that you are conscious."

"Allah be praised..." as he bows and leaves the room.  Azani quickly
walks up to the bridge...

"Charyn is awake and requires some medical assistance. She has a
headache and I\'m sure the doctors would like to examine her to discover
her condition." "Mr. Zar, I have some experience in piloting, maybe I 
can help you on the bridge."


 === Trakh ===

Fa\'eairl speaks.  _Anomaly detected in density scan of _Arbiter_.
Superdense volume of 25kL range which cannot be effectively imaged in
interior of vessel._

Intrigued, Akhouw contemplates the sensor information and depiction of
the _Arbiter_ in the main holotank. "An unusual ship, this one. Unarmed,
and yet..." He points at the anomaly datum. "Fa\'eairl. Anomaly aboard
the fiyfiyalr ship _Gemini Arbiter_. Speculate as to purpose, report
when complete."

As the data begins to come in, Aiwi\'s dewclaws extend further, but not
so much as to interfere with the work at hand.  She speaks without
turning from her displays; her tone is still unemotional,
professional, but she is appreciably louder than before, "Admiral,
scans show increased power flow to the Kingfisher\'s weapon turret...
definitely more than required for standby... the turret has moved from
its rest position, apparently targeting... the ringworld, or something
near it which does not show up on sensors.  Sir."

An icy ball forms in Aolrkhea\'\'s gut, but is swiftly dissipated by the 
rush of hormones she feels at the possibility of fighting and dying, the
same rush she knows her huntress ancestors felt on the wide savannahs of
Kusyu.  "They must be blaming the ringworld for their ship problems," she
said.  I don\'t like it.  We are almost between _Kingfisher_ and the ring,
and with homing or remote missiles, if they want to re-target on us,
they won\'t need to move the turret more than a handful of degrees!" 

Taken aback by this news, Akhouw swiftly recovers and shakes his mane in
irritated puzzlement. His fist thumps onto the arm of his command chair.

"For all my experience with fiyfiyalr, I cannot comprehend these odd
ones." He sighs in exasperation, then makes his commanding presence
felt, turning to each bridge officer and dispatching orders in rapid
succession.

Aolrkhea\' takes a deep breath.  "Admiral, your orders?"

"Aolrkhea\', prepare power plant for rapid implementation of full combat
power output, on my command. Initiate active EMS scan of _Kingfisher_,
localized to missile turret. Bring jammer systems online and target
_Kingfisher_ ONLY, but DO NOT ACTIVATE. Run screen diagnostics and
prepare to energize, on my command."

"Uhwaikh, traverse laser and target Kingfisher turret only; DO NOT
ENERGIZE." Akhouw speaks with urgency, but slowly and clearly, so
that there is no shadow of doubt. "DO NOT ACTIVATE MISSILE BATTERIES.
Ready sandcaster and place on active standby."

Aolrkhea\' taps her panel.  "Engineering, Bridge.  Aeawiyh, the Admiral
orders combat alert.  We may be requesting full combat power in the
space of a breath.  Prepare the fusion plant and stand by."

Akhouw turns to face forward, clearly confused and alarmed by this
inexplicable incident. "What is this Admiral Nanadth up to? There is no
antagonist. To attack us is madness, to fire upon the Ringworld is an
equally dishonorable attack. What can his purpose be?" His smouldering
eyes narrow.

"Aiwi, alert the _Khaurl_ by secure masercomm. Then open a general
radio channel and hail the Kingfisher." He looks at Aiwi to emphasize
his order. "Priority protocol. Request immediate visual communications
and demand that they explain this event and declare their intentions
openly."

Angrily, Akhouw shakes his mane. He takes a deep breath and visibly calms
himself. Dealing with fiyfiyalr always required a higher degree of self-
discipline and control of his natural aggressive instinct. This mission
was too important to be wrecked by improvident aggression, yet he could
not ignore the possible danger. Tolerance of dishonor extended only so
far.

Facing the main vidscreen and awaiting an answer, Akhouw meditated upon
the situation, hoping that saner, honorable, fiyfiyalr minds would yet
prevail. Perhaps the Zodian spirit was not unknown to them.

=====================================================

 ==== Aurora ===

Peace and quiet at last. Bhyarrvouf collapses into the Aurora\'s helm
couch and massages his temples wearily. The smell of Tweel\'s blood
fills his nostrils. After a long moment, he gets up with a groan.
"May\'s well get cleaned up," he grunts. "Before something else hap-"


 ==== Kingfisher ===

After a few seconds of thought, Mac realize it\'s time to make a decision.
He press the comm panel, "This is Kingfisher Witfield, come in Vouf!
We have a sitution here."


 ==== Aurora ===

\'Vouf slumps back down into the chair. "-pens."

He scans the tactical displays as he keys in the tight-beam line to the
command shuttle. There\'s something in Mac\'s voice that he doesn\'t like.

"Keyaho, Command Shuttle. This is Aurora, Bhyarrvouf. What SORT of a
\'situation\', Mac?"


 ===Paladin ===

Goughzar acknowledges Azani\'s offer of assistance.

"Azani, your recommendation is excellent. Please take control at the
pilot\'s station and continue decent as per our last oders. Dr. Morser,
please leave the computers alone and go check on Mr. Robins. I would
like her functional again as soon as possible."

"Ach nein nein nein...." Morser mutters, oblivious.

"Dr. Limner, as soon as you are functional again, I would like you to
resume your position with scanners and your "special" equipment. Please
notify me when you return to duty."

Paladin - Resume active and passive scans on landing zone and local
ships. Continue transfer of data to Alcyon Archives.

_Aye, sir._

As the communications signal opens up that the Aurora is locked in,
Zar begins sending.

"Greetings Subcommander. Paladin has regained control after Iasic
decided to leave us suddenly - apparently under orders from Admiral
Ger. Charyn is still unconcious, but apparently coming around. Dr.
Limner has been unaffective since original contact with the ringworld.
Azani is taking over pilots station and Dr. Morser is looking into
the status of Charyn. Situation seems to be stable and we are
continuing decent to Ringworld as per previous orders...

"Sudvok aeggra!! This place can be very unnerving! Can you provide
with any updates from other ships/situations? Zar Out."

*Ship\'s in working condition, two crew members down. Aslan are quiet,
but they\'re never quiet for long*

Paladin - resume defensive programs for maneuvering and passive
cloaking.


 ==== Kingfisher ===

"Oh, I don\'t know." Mac tries to be as casual as he can. "The commander
has just ordered missiles launch against the ring world. Several members
disagree, so now some of them have guns out, aimming at god knows what.
The commander has just transfered the fire control to his own seat.
I figure now would be a good time to let you know, before a gun fight
erupts and I have to shoot everyone."


 === Phin Shuttle ===

"I\'m getting worried about this.  (addressing Doejin and Ferdy) `Hey guys,
if you can hear me, how far away are we from the Talisman now?  No one has
answered my radio call.  Are we out of range or something?\' "

Ferdy silently glides over to the viewscreen with Ian in tow.  Looking
through the monitor is a little disoncerting as the output is optimized
for eyes that see in the dark, with little detail.  Many  sounds of many
kinds emanate from the terminal though.

Ian squints.  "I think I can figure this out..."

Gliding slowly around the sono-holo, Ian discerns R-alpha - at least the
closest parts of the unbelievably narrow band of hyper-dura-steel (or
whatever it is) that is closest to the ragtag clump of ships.  Light
from the pseudo sun casts hard shadows on the Alcyon, now lit only
slightly so that Ian\'s eyes can make it out.  Nearest the shuttle,
and getting nearer at an alarming rate, is a small wedge-shaped ship.

Slowly it sinks in what the scale of things is, as he compares the size
of the ring to the distances between the ships.  "Let\'s see, if we we\'re
near the Talisman -- here, just ten minutes ago, and now we\'re  -- here,
then that means we\'re getting, hmmm 7, 8, no NINE GEES at least!  HOLY
SHEEIT!"

A smile washes over him.  Ian whistles softly to himself, then mutters,

"Wow.  Now that\'s what I call maneuverability.  Look at that lump of gray
zooming in.   Can almost make out the name... Mastmind?  no-- Westmind?
.. Oh!  Westwind!  Neat name.  I wonder if they\'re in trouble."

"Good piloting Doejin."


 === Alcyon: CMO\'s Cabin ===

The view in the holo is instructive, to say the least. OSF-4 is
hovering nearby, holding up a plastic bag of Type Three Plasma,
draining it into the exposed subfemoral vein in Tweel\'s lower leg.
Blood is everywhere; unit after unit is fed into the vein to keep
Tweel\'s blood pressure up, only to seep from the bleeding wounds.

Lucan is watching and recording as O\'Shi, muttering to himself through
a hastily-adjusted filter mask, works over the unconscious Ael. His
technique is clumsy but brutally efficient-- centimeter by centimeter,
he goes over each and every one of the pulled sutures, holding the
suturedissolve and the suturegun IN THE SAME HAND!

As the saga inside the cabin continues, the careful speed of Christian\'s
handiwork slowly ratchets up, notch by notch. He can only spare brief
glances, but keeps well appraised of O\'Shi\'s crude treatment. His right
eyebrow looks as if it would like to crawl past his scalp, as the rest
of Christian\'s face tightens into a mask of protective anger. The change
from his typical behavior is notable. His mood is one of genuine outrage
at Mahlel\'s dangerous disregard for patient welfare and the willful
insubordination, aggravated by O\'Shi\'s cavalier attitude and continued
insults, as well as a fierce concern for the life of his Ael Yael friend.

Christian can do little to express his incredulous fury, contenting himself
with dark mutterings and sotto voce commentary. "... arrogant worm-bait,
got the brain of a bloodvark .... Tweel better be ok ... Mahlel will wish
he\'d never signed aboard ..... typical thug, let up on him, give him some
power, he turns into a swaggering, prinked up, arrogant, lazy twerp with
delusions of competence .... a blind man could do better than that butcher
... the brig\'s too good for him ...."

O\'Shi continues working with the suturedissolve and the suturegun.
Poising them delicately like a pair of chopsticks, he gently washes
away the torn fibroplastic material from the ragged wounds and
replaces it with fresh suturing in one pass.  His other hand follows
the seam gently, a suction probe pulling away detritus and old blood
where necessary and two fingers preventing the wounds from opening.
The effect is rather like a two-headed zipper being eased along; as
long as neither zipper head gets far from the other, the seam remains
closed.

It looks easy, but O\'Shi is obviously having a tough time of it; sweat
is pouring down his face, and he pauses once in a while to whip a
forearm across his eyes to clear them. Once, a suture pops just ahead
of his hand and a scar gapes open; Lucan prepares to glide forward,
but O\'Shi clears away the blood with a particularly descriptive curse
and gets the seam under control once more.

In stark contrast, Christian is dry and utterly confident of himself as
he surveys the updated test results; liver functions had begun the slow
ascent to healthy levels and the kidneys were beginning to shrug off their
paralysis as a healthier hue of red suffused through them. Blood filter
augmentation would only be needed for about a day, until the body had
adjusted to the rapid positive changes and settled into its normal
biochemical rhythm.

Upon observing O\'Shi dancing upon the precipice of butchery, Christian\'s
eyes widen even further in anxious shock. His response is not to explode
into a fresh paroxysm of rage, but instead, subsides into a misleadingly
even-tempered exterior as the cauldron of emotion is fueled from within,
in a phenomenon not unlike the eye of a hurricane. Any fellow expedition
colleague would recognize the warning signs and take cover until the
Van Der Merwe nor\'easter had passed.

O\'Shi is operating at a speed that would incite a malpractice suit in
any sane hospital; by the time van der Merwe has finished the trauma
repair and is preparing to close, O\'Shi has patched every one of the
Ael\'s torn sutures and is setting down his instruments with shaking
hands. "Keep an eye on him," he instructs Lucan as he tears off his
filter mask and staggers out of the room, wiping his face with a
sterile-cloth.

With OSF-4 and Triple Three providing a close watch of Tweel\'s condition,
Lucan flies out of the room in haste, bumping past the lumbering O\'Shi on
the way out, in response to the urgent recall order. Stopping at the trauma
bay, Lucan is enlisted by Christian to assist in one of the quickest surgical
closings ever mentioned in the annals of surgery, with a series of rapid
bursts from the knitting laser and the insertion of double-strength protein
closure sutures along the circumference of the operating area.


 === Talisman ===

Ralf IMMEDIATELY spots a small object, warm with respect to background and
radiating faint neutrino emmissions, arching high over the plane of the
ecliptic. A trajectory trace points back to the recently discovered derelict.
It could be a lifeboat of some kind, or forcibly ejected detritus.

Meanwhile, Redd is doing his best imitation of an entire Engineering crew....

"Fusion  plant\'s cooling off, reserve power only - no drives, no gravity,
no weapons and no rest for the wicked until we get it started again.  Ho-hum,
wonder how the rest of the ships are doing ?"

(Sound of pre start-up checks on fusion power plant in the background)

"Engineering to bridge - We\'ll have power back shortly,  I hope.  No problems
this end as yet."

Ralf remarks, "Fortunately we don\'t have to do a FULL restart;  the computers
went down, but they didn\'t take the fusion plant all the way down with them."

Thul barks, "Helm! Continue to the LZ!"


 ==== Aurora ===

"HRF?!" Bhyarrvouf sits up ramrod-straight in his chair. He glares at
the intercom, and a tiny noise is heard in the silent cabin.

*spung*
*spung*

After a long silence, \'Vouf speaks again, but his voice is little more
than a whisper.

"Mac, be a good little pup and patch the Bridge securecam into the
commo line so I can see this, hrm, \'situation\' for myself, will you?
It almost sounds like a bad joke. Almost." He straightens up and
flicks the transmit controls on the Aurora\'s outgoing data to audio
only. "And I want to talk to Count Ger. Kae, I want to talk to
EVERYBODY in this, this, this SITUATION. I want someone to calmly and
objectively, with NO editorializing, explain to me the EXACT sequence
of events leading up to this....situation. Aysap, as you pi-- you
humans would say."


 ==== Kingfisher ===

Mac had a tiny image of \'Vouf in his holotank, which no one else on the
Bridge could see. What he saw was as follows:

When the camera is activated on the other end, \'Vouf is covered in
blood. It is all over his fur and his uniform, and his gauntlets
are soaked with it. After Mac delivers his little bombshell, Vouf\'s
ears go back and he snarls viciously; at the moment of the tiny sounds
from the other end, Mac THINKS he sees a gleam of metal for a instant.
Then \'Vouf reaches forward and shuts off the holo. When he finally speaks,
the link to the Kingfisher is audio only. As he speaks, a datastream
comes in intermodulated with the voice message, coded to appear on Mac\'s
console only:

_CAN I TRUST YOU?_

Mac continues to check the comm station, and while everyone is talking, he
carefully codes a reply of his own into the datastream...

_IT\'S YOUR CALL. I\'LL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO PREVENT ALL HELL BREAK LOOSE._

"Yea, it does sound like a bad joke from the Friday night sitcom
Galaxy Family. But I have a few people with guns here that will say
otherwise." Mac punches several buttons on the comm station.
"Camera coming online, sir."

_JUST KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN AND STAY COOL. NOBODY\'S GOING TO GET HURT, IF
I CAN HELP IT. KEEP THIS LINE OPEN AND GET READY FOR SOME SURPRISES._

Since there\'s no video it\'s hard to tell what sort of reaction the
view of the Bridge is having on Bhyarrvouf. His only comment for
several long seconds is, "Receiving holo data OK."

After a long moment, his voice continues, now heard over the whole
Bridge. People in this crew have heard Bhyarrvouf ecstatic, terrified,
bored, disgusted, self-satisfied, and boiling mad, but they\'ve NEVER
heard him sound like this. His voice is a cool, almost emotionless
stage whisper-- the only person who\'s heard anything like it is Rigo,
who remembers a psychopath that hacked up fifty women with a length of
binding wire in one of the living blocs back home.  "All right,
people. I\'m ready to hear what\'s going on. In the meantime, put the
guns away. That\'s not a request, it\'s an order."

A small frisson of fear runs down Rigo\'s spine as he hears the tone
\'Vouf\'s voice, but he dosen\'t relax his watch of Ger.

Zben taps the corner of his console labled `Commo Monitor\', and his voice
is tied into the line. "Mister Bhyarrvouf, We can playback on audio the
last 10 minutes {by my estimate} of conversation on the Bridge, if you
would like. This may answer all of your questions `objectively, with NO
editorializing\', as per request."

Zben calls up the `cockpit recorder\' and, unless he gets instant grief,
fires a compressed copy to the Aurora.

"Data received," Bhyarrvouf whispers. "Excuse me for a moment while
I review this. Even at the highest speed that speech is intelligible,
it\'ll take me a few minutes. In the meantime, I\'m still waiting for
you all to put your guns down."

Zben looks at armament still on display. "Y`know, that makes a lot of
sense. I think we\'re all professional enough to trust each other for a
few minutes." (With a small grin) "Who knows? We may be able to work
this out before Mr. Bhyarrvouf!" (His smile turns a bit grim) "C`mon
folks! Lets cool it before something drastic happens!"

"I concur." Rigo says in a calm soothing voice. "I suggest that
Commander Ger steps away from his console and that those of you
who\'s got your weapons out put them away. Both parties thinks
that they are in the right. Surely we can talk this over and
reach a conclusion without any gunplay. And, Mr. Bhyarrvouf,
don\'t jump to any conclusions."


 === Kingfisher ===

Mac continues his covert conversation with \'Vouf.

_WHAT DO YOU MEAN? CAN YOU EXPAND ON THAT? I CAN HELP IF I KNOW WHAT\'S
GOING ON._

_MAYBE. I NEED TO REVIEW THE TAPES FIRST. ALL I KNOW IS THAT WE\'RE IN AN
ARMED-WITH-HOSTAGES SITUATION RIGHT NOW. I CAN EXTRACT YOU IN A HURRY,
BUT I DON\'T WANT TO TIP MY HAND JUST YET. SIT TIGHT AND STAY COOL....
WHEN I KNOW WHERE EVERYONE STANDS ON THIS, I\'LL CONTACT YOU._

_OBKB, STANDING BY. I\'LL FOLLOW YOUR LEAD. GOOD LUCK!_


 === Westwind ===

Talon watches with his mouth half open as the native ship maneuvers
with ridiculous ease to match vectors with the Westwind.

"Just as well they seem to be friendly," he mutters to himself.

Then, not knowing what else to do, he plants a finger very
deliberately on the Transmit button of the ship\'s radio and calls:
"Hi there!  Now you\'re here, what\'s the plan?"


 === Alcyon Sickbay ===

Christian surveys the patient\'s current vitals and inspects his finished
work with an attention to detail, until he has met his own high standard
of excellence and has satisfied himself that the patient will rapidly
recover from the physical trauma. He types a short patient care order
into the sickbay computer, returns a few scattered instruments to their
respective alcoves, and then straightens up.

"That oughta hold him stable \'til ya finish yer needlepoint, Doc," he
says, collapsing into a chair. He frowns at van der Merwe\'s careful work.
"Whatcha doin\', anyway? The Serenity Prayer in three colors, or what?"

*Mistake* thinks Tiblisi. *Never criticize anyone in front of others.
Especially a professional.  You don\'t want to make enemies and you never
know when you\'ll need their help.  Mr. Tact, you\'re not.  Besides, there
are many more subtle and effiecient ways to get at people.*

Doctor Sir Christian Van Der Merwe looks O\'Shi straight in the eye.

His gaze is unwavering. He doesn\'t flinch. He doesn\'t blink.

A reckoning has come due.

He notices Dulinor cleaning up the two other patients, both of whom are
moving a bit. His eyes widen. "NOT dead? Whew, that sets a record for
Most Blood Lost Wit\'out Snuffin\' It. Too bad, I was lookin\' forward ta
rollin\' the stiffs fer spare change....\'Vouf\'ll be upset too....whoops,
skip that last, sorry Doc."

His grin indicates he\'s anything BUT sorry.

*He\'s probably grinning about whatever joke he made about this "Vouf"
character,* thinks Lee, *but I don\'t like the crack about rolling stiffs.
I\'m liking this guy less and less. Still if this is some military ship,
I don\'t want to cross him either, but there\'s more than one way to settle
him down. He\'s push too hard. Not a good way to win friends and influence
people.*

Christian slowly smiles. Calculatingly, he takes a measured step around
the trauma bed and ominously paces towards O\'Shi. As if on cue, Lucan and
Dulinor glide forward, from the right, from the left, and converge upon
O\'Shi. In the blink of an eye, O\'Shi is lifted bodily out of his chair
and lifted up to meet Christian\'s gaze, point blank, while being firmly
restrained in mid-air by a small thicket of robotic tentacles. O\'Shi\'s
surprised struggles are unavailing against the unyielding metallic embrace
by robots well-programmed to deal with recalcitrant patients.

When he speaks, his voice is as dry and cold as the bitterly frigid arctic
air howling over the northern Siberian tundra in the dead of winter.

"Mister Mahlel, you are quite possibly the most pitiful excuse for a human
being that it has been my displeasure to know. Now that we have this chance
to talk, I think we should go over a few, minor things." Christian takes a
step forward to within scant centimeters of O\'Shi and stabs his finger into
Mahlel\'s tunic as if it were a blade.

"Life, as you knew it, is over. Get that through your fortress-like skull.
No more lounging around the Alcyon, sitting on your ass and digging for
mineral resources in your ear. No more slack supervision. No easy duty,
goofing off and in general acting like a worthless punk. You WILL start
earning every last credit Turnskaad is paying you."

As he begins to work his way into his list, Christian begins to warm to
his topic, becoming slightly more animated and expressive in delivering
his full-scale, DEFCON 1, nuclear butt chewing. His outraged tone develops
a hard, cutting edge to it, liberally supplemented with measures of sarcasm
and contempt.

"MISTER Mahlel, if you value your pitiful life, you will NEVER, EVER AGAIN
come charging into my Sickbay waving a rifle around and bellowing at the
top of your fetid lungs." Christian leans forward and emphasizes each point
with a sharp poke of his finger. "Further, a clumsy oaf such as yourself, with
*no medical training*, has NO BUSINESS WHATSOEVER performing ANY emergency
triage on a TREE-RAT, let alone a sophont, an Ael Yael, *MY FRIEND*!"

Here Christian closes to within millimeters of O\'Shi. His voice drops down to
a low, dangerous level of utter sincerity. The threat is unspoken. "If you
ever, I mean EVER, pull a stunt like that again you will answer to me, and
by God, you will wish you had never signed up with Turnskaad. Do not even
THINK of doing anything more than slapping bandages on a wound and CALLING
FOR A MEDIC." Christian grabs a fistful of tunic to give special emphasis
to his lecture, pulling O\'Shi fractionally upward. "*YOU CAME DAMNED CLOSE
TO **KILLING A PATIENT**, YOU MORON! LEARN WHEN TO LEAVE WELL ENOUGH ALONE!
That\'s what the damn medbots are for, twit!" He lets go of O\'Shi and takes
a half-step backward, forcing himself to regain his professional composure
as he does so.

"In the meantime, Mister, you will go to your cabin and you WILL remain there
for one sleep period. After that, you will ONLY leave your cabin to report
DIRECTLY to your ASSIGNED DUTY STATION and upon completion of each duty shift
you will return to your cabin IMMEDIATELY. Any deviation from this order will
be noted by Pater unless authorized by Mister Grey or a command team member.
When Commander Ger has the time, I am sure he will review your flagrant
conduct." Christian smiles again. "In the meantime, I strongly suggest that
if you see me in the hall, if you THINK you hear my footsteps, I would
suggest that you give me a wide berth, if you value your miserable skin."
He leans forward. "Keep your insubordinate smart-ass mouth shut, Mahlel,
or I will personally inform Subcommander Bhyarrvouf of your bigoted remarks."
Christian leans even closer. "Trust me, you don\'t want that."

Christian waves an arm at the Sickbay door. "Lucan, Dulinor, deposit this
person in his assigned cabin. Get him OUT OF HERE!" He views the vanishing
trio with undisguised relief and satisfaction. A nudge activates his comm
dot. "Pater, until further notice log all movement and activity of Mister
O\'Shi Mahlel, security code Command Beta. Inform myself, if aboard, or any
command representative and the bridge commander of any deviation from the
designated parameters." He briefly explains the restrictions to Pater,
then calls Morgan Grey and informs him of O\'Shi\'s conduct and Christian\'s
discipline. "Oh, and Pater, O\'Shi Mahlel is not to be admitted to Sickbay
without the permission of myself, Commander Ger, or Subcommander Bhyarrvouf."


 === Aurora ===

As Bhyarrvouf is talking to Mac, the incoming-message spooler records
the first message from the Aslan ship. While waiting for Mac to set up
the link, he has Moira parse it into text, and he scans it. His
fingers fly accross the keyboard, sending a tightbeam signal to the Trakh.

About 90 seconds after the first message is sent, the Trakh receives
a reply. It is not holo or audio, but standard Imperial-code text
parse data. It reads:

TRAKH THIS IS AURORA ALL SYSTEMS NOW NOMINAL DO NOT ANTICIPATE FURTHER
DISRUPTIONS AUDIO AND HOLO MESSAGES FOLLOW SOON OUT

The second Aslan message follows on the heels of the first. Bhyarrvouf,
his patience obviously wearing thin, taps out a reply.

The second message is also text, and is equally prompt:

TRAKH THIS IS AURORA YOUR ASSUMPTIONS CORRECT IASIC CONSTRUCT CAUSED
SYSTEM CRASH ON ENTRY AND AGAIN ON EXIT OTHER SHIPS DID NOT SHOW ENTRY
CRASHES DUE TO LACK OF RESISTANCE TO IASIC ALL SYSTEMS NOW CLEAR

TRAUMA VICTIMS NOW IN SICKBAY ON ALCYON DETAILS TO FOLLOW MORE CONTACT
LATER CURRENTLY HANDLING TWO MESSAGES AT ONCE MUST SIGNOFF

The link breaks immediately after that.


 ==== Kingfisher ===

Turning around, Mac reiterates, "All right people, you heard the man. Put
your guns away."

In an equally calm voice, one that has seen many stupid decisions made
by people not on the scene, Jan replies:

"Sir, with all due respect, I\'m in the process of arresting Admiral Ger.
The only guarantee that I have that Admiral Ger will not carry out an
illegal act right now is by shooting him.  He has demonstrated every
intent of carrying out an unwarranted and unjustified attack of the Ring.
He is still in a position to perform that act.  When I have completed
placing him under arrest, I will comply with your order.  To do so
beforehand would endanger the crew of this vessel and the expedition."

Addressing Admiral Ger:

"Sir, again, step back from the console."

Having stepped out of the fray after his emotional soliloquy, Jett is
sitting in a chair on the periphery of the action, looking mildly ashen
and slightly ill, though composed and at peace. Clearly the sudden turn
of events has shaken him, though he appears to be somewhat fatalistic
in his outlook.

He can be heard uttering a quiet aside to Ger. "I do believe this is a
command decision, Admiral."

Regardless of whether he moves back or not, Jan will try to get him away
from the launch control by enlisting the assistance of others on the
bridge:

"Mr Farouk, please secure your weapon, and assist the Admiral away from
the command station.  Your Worship, whilst your leaping through the
legalistics of this, could you give the XO a succint brief of my actions."

Jett favors Doctor Yorblin with a weaily tolerant eye. "Hardly the time for
legalisms, as you put it, Doctor." He shrugs his shoulders. "We are trusting
to the accuracy of our colleagues\' moral compasses, out here beyond the
reach of traditional law." He glances over at Zben\'s activity. "As I see
that the indubitable Mister Blaine has forwarded a record of events to
the Subcommander, I see little point in supplementing that cogent summary
of facts."

After the pause caused by the commo lag between the Kingfisher and the
Aurora passes, \'Vouf replies:

"Don\'t be tiresome, Doctor. You have no authority to arrest Count Ger,
nor have you any recourse to stop Count Ger from doing whatever he
wishes.  I\'m amazed at your ignorance; surely you must have realized
that the tac-HUD he\'s wearing would have allowed him to launch a
missile with literally the blink of an eye?"

While this discussion is going on, a private message from Aurora appears
at Mac\'s console:

_PATCH INTO THE DISPLAY DRIVERS FOR ZBEN AND ETIENNE\'S BOARDS. AVOID
THE CONTROL SYSTEMS, YOU\'LL TIP THEM OFF. I JUST NEED TO SEE HOW THEIR
BOARDS ARE CONFIGURED. IF YOU THINK YOU\'LL GET CAUGHT, DON\'T TRY IT.
AND STAY CLEAR OF ABUKO\'S SYSTEM, HE\'S RUNNING ENOUGH SOFTWARE TO EAT
YOU ALIVE, IF I KNOW THE SKUNK. PATCH IN AND SEND ME SNAPSHOTS._

Cautiously, Mac replies:

_WILL DO_

Mac carefully takes surreptitious display dumps of Zben and Etienne\'s
holo-consoles as requested by \'Vouf, views them, and sends them to the
Aurora.

"If the launching of a missile salvo were his ultimate intent, the
missiles would be on their way by now." states \'Vouf.  "Therefore we
must assume that he had something else in mind entirely. Whatever the
case may be, your pointing a gun at him is doing nothing other than
heightening the possibility of an accident.  Please stop acting like
a holodrama hero; that, as you should know by now, is MY bailiwick."

The silence returns, as \'Vouf continues reviewing the records.

Jan safes his gauss pistol and brings it down to his side.

"Sir, please review the holo.  You\'ll note that the missile was accessed
Admiral Ger through the command console, not his tacHUD.  As for my arrest
authority, I believe I have that as a Scout on Detached Duty/Retired,
and as a ship\'s officer.  Believe me, I\'d rather leave the heroics to
someone much better suited for them."

"Let\'s _all_ calm down." Rigo tries again. "Commander, is whatever you
hope to accomplish worth risking an escalation of this situation? If it\'s
the challenge to your authority you find insupportable, be assured that
none of us does this lightly. Surely anything that can drive a number of
sober, responsible veterans of assorted military and para-military services
to turn on their CO is worth reconsidering before carrying out. Damnit, I
know as well as anybody how dangerous dissent within an expedition in these
circumstances are. But that still dosen\'t absolve me from stopping you from
committing a criminal act. Please step away from the console, Commander,
and the rest of you, please put your guns away."

Jett sits back into the padding of his chair and speaks to the nearest
audio pickup, his voice oddly flat, as if he is beyond worrying about
the consequences. "Subcommander, facts are facts. The Admiral wanted to
demonstrate our destructive power on the Ringworld-being and his order
has been countermanded by Mister Farouk. In justifying his order, the
Admiral has made it clear he is unconcerned with the potential for true
catastrophe that may ensue. Others have spoken and I have said my peace."

Jett turns his chair to face forward and closes his eyes for a moment.
"Undoubtedly you will take action that you see fit. It is of no matter
to me. I, for one, am beginning to regret my choice of employment."


 === R-Alpha ===

Ayrlathi emerges from the Hall of the Ezad, and descends the three
broad, shallow steps onto the street.

It was a short meeting.  Ayrlathi described what had happened and
answered some questions.  Brief and to the point.  There was not a
lot that he could report.  Nobody blamed him for the sudden and
unexpected departure of the mimp.  They knew it was not his fault.

That does not make Ayrlathi feel any better.  He feels somehow more
depressed and guilty than he has ever been before.  His hand strays
into the pocket of his tunic, where his fingers close around a set
of small, flat, hexagonal objects.

Subconsciously he notes a small figure approaching from his left flank,
but he pays it no attention.

As he walks slowly along the street, he pulls the objects from his
pocket and begins to examine them closely for what must be the
thousandth time.  The six-sided plaques are deep blue and wondrously
smooth to the touch.  What they might be made of, Ayrlathi has no idea.
Each of the plaques has a different white symbol on it.  Picking out
one of the plaques, Ayrlathi holds it up away from the rest and watches
as the white symbol suddenly changes its design.  He knew it would do
that, but it never ceases to fascinate him.

"Teacher?"

In his far left eye Ayrlathi sees young Elivadin trotting towards him.

Ayrlathi restores the plaque to its pile.  "Yes, Elivadin?"

"Is it true what they say?  That you will not seek the office of the
Fedwis?"

Ayrlathi throws up his hands in a shrug.  News obviously travels fast
through Hilawin.  "Hzzzz... yes, Elivadin, it is true."

"But why?  Everyone thinks you are the natural choice to be the next
Fedwis."

"It is..." Ayrlathi\'s arms flail wide as he searches for the right
words, "...difficult to explain.  You see, I have changed, in a
manner of speaking.  Or at least, my outlook on the world has
changed."

"Is that because of the mimp?"

"Yes.  Seeing it has made me realise how little we know about what
lies beyond our own lands.  Just think, Elivadin, what strange worlds
could there be out there that we are oblivious to?  When I first set
eyes on the mimp -- or perhaps even before then -- I knew that my
destiny was somehow linked with it.  I could not in good conscience
commit myself to the responsibility of being the Fedwis of Hilawin,
when I knew that I must set my sights on much more distant things."

"I think I begin to understand," Elivadin says a little uncertainly.
"But the mimp is gone now."

Ayrlathi\'s vertical hand motion acknowledges the truth of Elivadin\'s
point.  "This is the great tragedy for me, Elivadin.  That the mimp
should have been taken from us so suddenly, without warning.  I was
expecting others of its kind to come searching for it, and I had so
much I wanted to ask them.  Do you know, I was seriously thinking of
asking them to take me with them when they left."

"Take you with them?"

"Why not?  How better to learn about them than to travel with them?"
Ayrlathi pauses for a moment, and his tendrils start to droop.  "Alas,
I never got the chance.  But I still hope that they might come back
some day.  I will be watching and waiting."

The light of understanding dawns on Elivadin.  "I see now why you
cannot become the Fedwis."  Suddenly he changes the subject.  "What
is that in your hand?"

Ayrlathi looks down and realises that he is still holding the set of
blue plaques.  "Hzz.. these?"  He hands them to Elivadin for him to
examine.  "I do not really know what they are.  I found them long ago
in the Zarajid ruins.  See how the white symbols change as you move
them in relation to one another?"

"Why yes!" Elivadin is immediately entranced by this strange effect.
"How wonderful!"

"Keep them," says Ayrlathi.  "Perhaps you will have better luck than
me in finding out what they are for."

"Oh, thank you!"  Elivadin is clearly delighted with this gift.  He
runs off clutching his new-found treasure in front of him.

Seeing Elivadin\'s joy raises Ayrlathi\'s spirits a little.  But not much.


 ===Paladin ===

The answer to Zar\'s hail is long in coming-- uncomfortably long, in
fact. When it arrives, it is not a voice/holo message as expected, but
a datapulse, a laser burst less than a half second long. When decoded,
the clear is in heavily idiomatic Vuakedh, very tough to translate
unless one\'s from deep inside the Antares sector. Once translated, it
reads as follows:

_SUDVOK AEGRRA IS RIGHT. WE HAVE A PROBLEM, LITTLE COUSIN. THE
COMMAND SHUTTLE HAS BEEN HIJACKED BY MUTINEERS AND COUNT GER IS
BEING HELD HOSTAGE AT GUNPOINT. I AM TYPING TO YOU AND NEGOTIATING
BY AUDIO WITH THE MUTINEERS AT THE SAME TIME. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO
CONTACT THE KINGFISHER; RELAY THIS MESSAGE TO THE TALISMAN AT ONCE.
BOTH SHIPS ARE TO REMAIN ON COURSE UNTIL FURTHER ORDERS; I AM
ATTEMPTING TO DEFUSE THE SITUATION BEFORE ANYONE IS HURT._

There is a moment\'s pause, then another message arrives.
_GOUGHZAR, IF I DIE AND YOU SURVIVE TO RETURN HOME AGAIN, TELL
KHOMBHYARR HIS SON DIED WELL, AND THAT BHYARRKHARR IS HEIR NOW. GIVE
HIM PATER\'S SECURITY RECORDS ON THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN ME AND ADRIAN
BISHOP, THREE SHIP-DAYS AGO. THE SECURITY CLEARANCE CODE IS WRITTEN ON
THE WALL OF MY CABIN, IN VUAKEDH. I HOPE YOU WON\'T NEED IT. WISH ME

=====================================================

 === Trakh ===

Aolrkhea\' reconfigures her board slightly, and puts bridge repeaters for
engineering in an out of the way corner of her panel.  She swiftly begins
to warm up the EMSJammer and screen systems, cursing inwardly.  *This whole
trouble is completely unnecessary -- what a collection of tahiwihtektau!
Kai, when this is all over, I\'m retiring and finding a rich landed male
who wants to support scientific research....*

The active EMS array on _Trakh_ rotates from its\' last scan point and
points directly at the command shuttle\'s missle turret.  Aolrkhea\' carefully
locks the scanner on, checking alignment twice.  A Galanglic phrase
drifts through her mind.  *Here we go.*  She taps the ACTIVATE stud with
one of her finger claws.  The sensor activates, and immediately begins
to scan the _Kingfisher_ missile turret.

"Admiral, my board is clear.  Safety interlocks remain engaged.  Active
scanning has commenced.  All systems ready, at your command."

Akhouw acknowledges her report with a nod. "Give active scan analysis
priority, feed to main holotank." His eyes are bright with the thrill
of the moment, well aware of the possible danger that lurks ahead. He
continues to contemplate his available moves and countermoves.

"If I may tender a suggestion, admiral," Aolrkhea\' quietly continues,
"Perhaps we should recognize the ringworld\'s presence before a clan
war starts on what is, in a sense, its\' land."

Akhouw turns just far enough to look over at the engineering station with
a thoughtful expression. "The Ringworld is aware of our presence, Aolrkhea.\'
I have had some prior communication with... it. However, if you intend to
suggest that we inform it of this situation, I concur. Use a directional
radio broadcast aimed AWAY from the fiyfiyalr and towards the Ring. Warn
it of the potential missile launch and inform it that we are attempting to
investigate and avoid unnecessary conflict. I am standing by for further
communications if it wishes. Put any reply through to me."

Replies arrive from _Aurora_.  As they come in, Aolrkhea\' puts them on the
viewer in an out-of-the-way box near the ship\'s plot.

By the time _Trakh_ gets the replies, they too are a bit busy.  The holo
image dissolves and a simple text message is sent in its\' place.

AURORA, TRAKH ACKNOWLEDGES.  WILL STAND BY.  OUT.


 ==== Aurora ===

"Mister J--" A pause, then a careful emphasis, without any overtones
of sarcasm discernable. "JUDGE Jett. I wish that for one moment you
could sit here beside me and watch this holo-- facts are indeed facts,
and everything you have said about Count Ger\'s actions, if not his
words, is not fact but supposition. As I just told the -- hrmf -- good
Doctor, it would have been trivial for the Commander to launch the
missiles himself at any one of several junctures. Yet he didn\'t. I,
for one, am curious as to why not. I believe I have a guess, but I\'d
like to hear it from the Commander himself."


 === Paladin ===

Zar reads through the displayed message with the skill of someone
born to the region. A string of curses follows quickly, although it
is doubtful that anyone else on the bridge can read what is
displayed in the heads-up holo.

"Paladin to Talisman, Priority Message, relayed from Subcommander
Bhyarrvouf.
DO NOT, repeat, DO NOT, attempt to contact the Kingfisher. It is
currently being hijacked by mutineers, details unknown. Commander Ger
is being held at gunpoint and Vouf is attempting to defuse things. Relayed
orders are to continue on previous course. I am making full active and
passive scans of the landing site and will relay the information to you when
I have it properly corelated and interpreted.

Acknowledge Please, Goughzar out."

The response from Thul is fast in coming. "Talisman Aye!"

And with that Zar goes back to investigating R-Alpha and it\'s landing
site until more messages come back, cursing the fact that Iasic can
no longer provide the instant communication. Suddenly a thought comes
into his head and he sprays out a string of Vuakedh. When he realizes
he is speaking in that tounge, he immediate switches back and repeats
it in a more "human" language.

"To sophont at 3347.5MHz, please respond. I am Goughzar, commander
aboard the ISS Paladin, a member of the Alcyon expedition. As the
commander of this ship, I would like to request the return of the
interface with the entity known as Iasic. I feel such communication
would be beneficial to both of us, and our journey to R-Alpha."


 === Kingfisher ===

At Abuko\'s sensor station, the marker square surrounding the Aslan vessel
on the display changes to angry red and the classic warning noice used since
thousands of years to indicate that a ship is hit by active sensors echoes
on the bridge.

"Active! Active! Aslan-1\'s gone active on us! Passive lockon on Aslan-1
updated and on the offence and defence busses. Permission to hit the sucker
with an active scan?"

Johanns finger hovers expectantly over the active sensor controls.


 === Talisman ===

J.J. has been running simulation on the turret controls, he is getting
pretty good. He seems to have a natural affinity for weapon systems.

He sits in his combat armor chomping on a foul stogie, enjoying the
arcade type game the computer is putting him thru. In the corner of the
holo-tank he has security systems on line. Every so often he glances
at the secur-cam output for engineering and other area of the Talisman.

Thul says from his Captains chair, "Horne watch our six..." J.J grunts an
affirmative. He kills the sim. and fires up the passive scans checking
the sensor display for targets behind the Talisman. Then he runs through
the other targets, keeping a careful watch on the Aslan ships. Checking
the offensive estimates of the Aslan ship. "I need to know what that
baby can do in case it starts firing." he thinks. "Ya know, this could
become interesting real quick." he says to no one in general. Minutes
float by J.J. continues to scan the constantly updating passive targeting
data. Then the blip that represents the Aslan ship goes from white to red.

J.J\'s pulse quickens. A quick scan of the targeting data confirms what
he already suspected. "Gunner to Capt. RED ALERT! RED ALERT! target
designated Aslan1 had gone active, say again, Target designated Aslan1
had gone active. She is directing her scans on Kingfisher. What are your
orders!"


 === Paladin ===

Charyn has had a couple minutes to lay on her bunk.  The galaxy of
fireflies swimming before her eyes have, over the course of a few
minutes, subsided to a mere star cluster displayed in time-lapse
animation, like those hololessons from primary school science class
during the gravitation unit.  The cold sweat seems to have mostly
subsided too.

She feels the warm, soft texture of the cloth beneath her, loosely woven
from large, soft rag fibers.  She knows it\'s purple with a plain, bold
design.  Good luck seeing any colors through this sparkle dance!

"Goughzar to Charyn, how are you feeling? If you think you are able,
we could realy use your talents, as well as Dr. Morsers, at the bridge.
You also might be interested in this little datapulse I just got from
Vouf..."

"Charyn to Goughzar.  I feel like someone bashed in my head with a
crowbar." She drops her legs over the edge of the bed.  "I\'ll see what I
can do about getting up to the Bridge." She slowly pushes her body up to
her elbows *Feeling a little better, I think*.

She rises up to sit on the edge of the bunk, her head swollen, heavy.
She brushes the damp hair out of her face and sweeps it from her
forehead, pasted there from sweat *should\'ve tied this damn hair back*.
Concentrating, she looks about, then carefully stands.  Unimpressed, the
stars continue their parade.

She steps cautiously to the door - "open" - and out into the hall,
turning toward the bridge.  The stars explode with tiny fury.  Her skin
flushes with new heat and moisture.  Her legs weaken to the consistency
of...  *Oh God! not !!PASTA!!*.  She grimaces and jams her eyelids
together, pushing her forearms against her stomach, standing for a
moment.  Then, with sudden conviction, she takes five urgent steps to
the fresher.  "OPEN!!" As the door opens, she shakily controls a
collapse to her knees, one arm on the doorway.  She shuffles over to the
commode and noisily ejects the contents of her stomach.

Azani stares at the controls for a few seconds and gets accustomed to
the control locations. He then sits in the co-pilot\'s seat and continues
with the descent of the Paladin to the Ringworld.

A mere heartbeat after Zar makes his request to the Hoop that Iasic return,
the lights flicker and dim momentarily.  Once again, the artificial
personality construct of the _Talisman\'s_ computer is submerged, replaced by
the voice of someone who many thought had gone for good.

_Commander Zar, MasterSPU R-Alpha contacted me, forwarding your request.  As
you are the commanding officer of this vessel, and because MasterSPU assured
me that my reestablishment of contact with you would be net beneficial, I have
assented to return._

_MasterSPU has been monitoring the events of your command shuttle "Kingfisher"
and has relayed all information to me.  I must admit, I am continually baffled
by your erratic behavior.  It is illogical for a ship crew to disrupt and
disobey the directions of the leader.  Why should there be a leader if his
orders are not going to be followed?  Of course, his stated belief that the
missile launch he has planned might actually damage R-Alpha is incorrect.  What
is more puzzling still is the fact that I compute there to be a 96.425 percent
chance that Count Ger knows this, too.  If this is the case, then why would he
make an order that he knows to be futile?  This is most inefficient._

_I have informed the Aslan that the Kingfisher intends no threat to their
vessel.  I predict that there is a 93.8 percent chance that this will remove
any danger of a pre-emptative strike by them against the command shuttle or
any other part of the Turnskaad fleet.  There is a 4.105 percent chance that
they will construe this as a trick and will therefore initiate a pre-emptative
strike which they might not have actually done.  Given status quo, there was a
30 percent chance that a strike by the Aslan would result._

_Now, what is it that you would like me to do?  You may consider me at your
disposal._

That same, patient cursor flashes at the bottom of the screen.

"Guezdhe. Thank you for returning. I would like to request that you
contact the ships _Talisman_, _Westwind_, and _Gemini Arbiter_ and
allow us to communicate faster than the laser communications allows.
Also, if you could give me some more information about the starship
we recently detected along the far side of the ring. If you can
extrapolate any data from the accident as to cause as well as if
there are any survivors requiring assistance, I would appreciate it.

"In the meantime, I\'d still like some info on my prior request - about
who we will be meeting and some data about the landing zone and the
area around it. A simple combined scan image would be Guezke!"

"Oh yeah - and I think Dr. Morser was slightly fascinated by you and
would probably like to speak with you on subjects I can not begin
to understand."

At this, Goughzar lets an uncharacteristicly human grin flash
across his face, although perhaps it shows more teeth than is
normal for a normal grin...


 === Aurora ===

"The Aslan craft has gone active, Subcommander," Moira reports quietly.
"She is probing the weapons systems of the Command Shuttle."

"O kae NO!" Bhyarrvouf slams a metal fist down on the holopanel, striking
sparks. "NO NO NO NO NO NO--"


 === Gemini Arbiter ===

"This is boring!" fumes Nichole.  "How long are we going to sit hear and
watch?"

"As long as necessary!" snaps Aurelia.  "You\'ve just pointed out yourself
the Aslan ship powered up a little more. We know we can\'t afford to get
caught in the middle of a fight. Besides, it hasn\'t been that long anyway."

Nikki idly scrolls through the system check records, and then sits straight
up.  "HEY!  Look at this.  What\'s on the radio at 1337.45 MHz?"

"How should I know!" grouses Aurelia.  "With all that\'s been happening we
really haven\'t had much time to analyze anything, now have we!"

Nichole reaches for the commo panel.  "Let\'s find out!"

"Sure." sighs Aurelia.  "Why not? Go ahead."

Nichole opens a com channel, clears her throat and addresses the
ether.  "Uh. Hello."

"\'Uh. Hello.\'" sneers Aurelia.  "What kind of protocol is that?"

Nikki glares at her sister.  "Oh, shut up! Oops!"  She quickly toggles off
the comm channel.  "Now look what you made me do!"  Opening the channel
again, she continues, "This is Nichole Xerxes, First Officer, aboard the
Gemini Arbiter requesting identification and communication with anyone on
this channel.  Awaiting your reply. Out."

Closing the channel again, she comments, "Now, lets see what happens. Why
don\'t we call the other ships too?"

"Hold on!" responds Aurelia. "Let\'s do one thing at a time. All we need to
do is clutter up the channels, someone gets distracted and boom! Weapons
fire. No. We wait for a reply from whomever is on the other end."

Aurelia pauses for a moment as the content of Nichole\'s broadcast sinks
in.  "Wait a minute, I thought you were Chief Engineer?"

"I am." agrees Nikki.  "I\'m also First Officer. You\'re the Captain. Right?
I\'m the only other being aboard, therefore, I\'m First Officer!"

"Oh, right." Aurelia rolls her eyes.  "How *COULD* I forget!"

Suddenly, a voice from the commo speakers fills the bridge.  It is
powerfully modulated and pleasing to the ear. "Greetings, Visitors.
I am the world beneath you; the other Visitors have seen fit to call
me the Ring. I welcome you."

It continues, "Suspicion. A difficult and dangerous concept. It causes
so much trouble. To ease the way to a peaceful resolution to ALL of
your suspicions, I have allowed the Iasic construct to return to your
computer for a short time, linking it instantaneously with the Paladin
and the Talisman."

Aurelia perks up.  "Hey Nikki, ask it if we can land and meet with it."

"Ok!..." replies Nikki.  Then she pauses at the commo controls.  "Wait.
Here\'s something coming in on another channel."


 === Paladin ===

As soon as Zar requests the communications links established between
_Paladin_, _Talisman_, _Westwind_, and _Gemini Arbiter_, Iasic responds.

_Although MasterSPU stated that I should not make contact with the other
vessels, there is nothing in the guidelines I was given that stated that I
should not allow you to communicate with them.  Your instantaneous
communications links have been established.  However, they cannot be opened
until each commander on each vessel has acquiesced.  I cannot act where I am
not welcome.  All each vessel will need to do is enter in the following
sequence to their communications panels:  101101.  Once the sequence is in
place, their link will be activated._

_Now, regarding your querries on the landing site and any questions posed by
Dr. Morser,  I am afraid that my stay with you will be brief; too brief to get
involved in any in-depth discussions, as much as I would enjoy it.  My purpose
here is simply to assist you in avoiding an unwanted catastrophe.  If there is
time, perhaps I could entertain some questions.  But this is unlikely, given
the current situation.  Time constraints are not a problem for me, but rather
for all of you.  You must be careful not to become distracted from the crisis
at hand._

Zar nods, activating the comm unit.

"This is Goughzar, captian of the _Paladin_. I have re-established contact
with the construct from the world below known as Iasic, and it and the ring
have graciously allowed us to comminicate using the technology of R-Alpha,
that these messages won\'t take so damn long!

To initiate the sequence to open a communication channel with the rest of
our ships, simply enter the sequence 101101 into your communications channel.
This has been provided by the "sophont" known as MasterSPU, and our gracious
thanks go to him. If you are willing to join the communications net, this
will activate it as though using a standard ship\'s intercom."

And into a sequence of Vuakedh that will take a bit to translate (the same
idiomatic speech Vouf had used earlier), Zar continues:

"Vouf, I have requested Iasic to restore communications links between all
of the ships except the one noted before... I believe I have not overstepped
my bounds by allowing the ships to communicate faster, although Admiral Ger
strictly advised that Iasic not be allowed back into our systems. If there
is more that I might do, I am ready. Goughzar Out"


 ==== Aurora ===

"NO SCANS, A.P.," Bhyarrvouf barks. "We\'re generating enough kakh war-fog
as it is. Let me talk to them before they do something stupid."


=== Trakh ===

On the bridge of the Trakh, Akhouw is sitting in his command couch, his
arms crossed in a noncommittal pose as he waits for either the fiyfiyalr
or the Ringworld to respond. Suddenly, Akhouw looks startled for a fraction
of a second, then he blinks twice in rapid succession and looks around the
bridge, frowning ever so slightly.

He stares at the holotank for a second, then turns to Aolrkhea\' with an
air of reluctant conclusion. "Belay active scanning, Aolrkhea\', but continue
a CLOSE watch on the fiyfiyalr shuttle and report further developments."

He swivels to face forward once again, as he resumes his pose of wary
observation.


 === Gemini Arbiter ===

Aurelia slumps in her seat.  "Looks like they want to talk now."

"Figures." frowns Nichole.  "They\'re worse than women. Can\'t make
up their minds!"

"Let\'s talk to the Ring." offers Aurelia.  "He at least seems less
likely to shoot us!  Here.  Let me."  Without waiting for approval,
she quickly transfers commo control to her own console and opens a
channel.

"This is Aurelia Xerxes, Captain of the Gemini Arbiter requesting
landing instructions, over."

Minutes pass, and then the powerful voice speaks again.

"You will find, in your computer memory, the coordinates of a suitable
landing site for your purposes. The Visitors plan to land there and
meet with one another...once their suspicions have been overcome. You
may come here in the manner and time of your choosing. Be welcome."

"Copy transmission." replies Aurelia instantly.  "Will comply. Arbiter
out for now."

"Comm hog!" grumps Nichole.

Ignoring the barb, Aurelia orders, "Nikki, check engine status. Be ready
for full thrust. I want to put some more distance between us and them."

"About time you decided something!" retorts Nichole.  Quickly recofiguring
her console for engineering systems, her fingers and voice rapidly tune the
systems.  "Power now on line.  System ready for full thrust."

"Ok." acknowledges Aurelia.  Tapping in the final course and slamming
the throttle wide open, she exults, "Here we go!"

"YEEEE! HAAAA!" shouts Nikki.

Grinning ear to ear, Aurelia echos her sisters enthusiasm.

"Ring world here we come!"


 === Trakh ===

On the bridge of the Aslan command ship, a message appears on the direct
line of the main computer.  How it got there is a mystery to all, as the
electronics are shielded, isolated, and loaded with anti-invasion safeguards.
Nevertheless, the message is there, and no one on the _Trakh_ put it there.

The text of the message is accompanied by a proud and confident male aslan
voice, speaking in the flawless dialect of the clan that runs the _Trakh_.

_Attention most noble Admiral Akhouw.  My name is Iasic, a denizen of
the world below.  We are honored by your presence, and extend you a warm
welcome._

Momentarily taken aback by the unorthodox method of communication, Akhouw
quickly adapts his thinking. The proper use of trokh honorifics and in
particular the flawless pronunciation of the words clearly pleases the
Admiral as he listens to the message.

_Your efficient and loyal crew has correctly surmised that the fiyfiyalr
vessel "Kingfisher" has activated its missile turret and has indeed aimed
it toward the ringworld.  The Clanlord of the ringworld is completely
congnizant of this situation.  The ringworld is in no danger.  Equally
important, you and your brave crew are in no danger from attack by the
fiyfiyalr.  Your precautions of locking weapons on their vessel and preparing
to energize your weapon banks were the obvious and correct choice given the
circumstances and your lack of concrete reconnaissance.  I can assure you and
your valiant crew that the chances of a fiyfiyalr attack upon you are less
than two percent, well within the level of statistical error._

_I thank you for your attention and commend you on your actions.  You and
your crew bring honor to your clan._

Akhouw waits until the channel is open, then his confident tones are heard
once again. "Iasic, Your words do us great honor. Rare indeed is it to find
one not of the fteirle who can speak our language with such fluency, of
course your nature makes that task a minor one, no doubt. We appreciate your
communication with us."

He shifts slightly in his seat, as his tail flicks away an imaginary dust
speck. "I have been similarly puzzled by the actions of the fiyfiyalr aboard
the shuttle designated Kingfisher. Any data you could furnish to us would be
most helpful. We desire to maintain our current computer operating system at
this time, but my Computer Officer (he motions to Aiwi) will designate an
input designated solely for your use. When time permits, Aiwi will discuss
with you possible enhancement of our computing resources."

Leaning back in his couch, he slowly, thoughtfully strokes his mane. "Are
those terms acceptible, khihe? If you could further enlighten us as to the
recent appearance of a derelict spacecraft and survivors which were, khrr,
teleported to the Aurora, I would be most honored."

Akhouw waits for the reply with a pleased expression on his face. To no one
in particular, he remarks: "Kai! Honor indeed to our clan, if we can avoid
this useless conflict brought about by the fiyfiyalr, understand what is
happening with these odd humans, and even further our knowledge of this
Ringworld." He yowls an Aslan chuckle as the grin widens on his face and
he relaxes into his well-appointed, cushioned couch.


 === Kingfisher ===

As Johann poises to activate an active scan, one of his monitor programs
picks up activity on the fibre-optic net controlling the holodynamic
displays on the Bridge.

The activity detected is an access by Mac Witfield from his communications
terminal to the software that controls the display drivers for several
of the Bridge holos.  It does NOT appear to be interfering with their
operation in any way; the process is simply taking "snapshots" of the
holo-panel configurations for the stations currently manned by Zben
and Etienne, and dumping the data to memory.

The two snapshots of the holo panels are very interesting; Etienne\'s
has an override slider for the cabin gravity, capable of setting it
at anywhere from zero to several G\'s at a touch, and Zben\'s has a
power shutoff for the missile turret.  Neither has been activated yet.

Mac thinks to himself, "gees, why am I NOT surprised..."

Mac quietly taps in the interface designations for the specific controls
he want to override on both Etienne\'s and Zben\'s consoles, followed by
the instruction to deactivate both interfaces.  Mac\'s own holo-panel
immediately lights with a single small "Status - no error" icon,
indicating the task was completed successfully.


 === Gemini Arbiter ===

As the Xerxes sister hurtle towards their rendezvous with R-Alpha,
a somewhat less than serious conversation is taking place on the
bridge of their ship.

"You know," remarks Aurelia, "we never had much time to converse with
this entity.  Let\'s open a channel, shall we?"

"Sounds like a good idea." agrees Nichole.  "But first we have to get
him a better name! Ring sounds dumb. How about Ringo?"

"Or Ringy?", counters Aurelia.

"Or Ringer?" offers Nikki.

Aurelia grimaces.  "Sounds like a torture device or washing machine. How
about RW? For Ring World."

"Yeah!" exclaims Nikki.  "Initials are very commonly used. RW it is. Now,
only if he likes it."

"Well, don\'t just sit there!" insists Aurelia.  "Ask him!"

Opening a comm channel, Nichole begins, "Hello Ring. My sister and I
talking and we\'d like to give you a nickname. Something more appropriate
than Ring. How does RW sound? We think it is more fitting for one of your
station to have a proper name. And if you don\'t mind we\'d like to continue
this conversation for awhile."


 === Talisman ===

Redd thinks of the mess left on the Alcyon.

"That tears it ! Vouf will probably \'defuse\' things with those gauss
pistols of his ! That damn triggerhappygung-hoegotisticalkillingmachine!"

"Don\'t worry Redd, I\'m sure we\'ll be able to put the Kingfisher back
together when he\'s done.  Or, most of it, anyway..."

"Ralf, I hate to go round orders like this, but can you get us some idea of
what\'s actually going on out there ? It could make all the difference."

	"Uhm, lemme see, in engineering you\'re higher rank, so you\'re my
superior officer, right?"  Ralf grins.   He pulls his handheld out and
drops across the Iasic-link to Paladin, then across tight-beam to Aurora.
Spotting the blackbox log Vouf\'s reading, he quickly skims it in compressed
subjective time.  Seconds later he turns to Redd (and Tabor) with a glazed
look on his face.  "Uhm, er... sheesh!  Okay (deep breath):

Ger ordered, uhm, Etienne to get a missile lock on a location on the Ring,
	then ordered him to fire.
Farouk, objected to this strenuously, to the point of drawing his pistol.
Rigo (I *think*) is either backing him or just getting ready to deal with
	mass mayhem.
The Judge backed up Farouk with the legal opinion that firing the missile
	would be a crime, and that this expedition isn\'t military.
Ger defended his authority to have the missile fired.
Doc Yorblin backed up Farouk and pulled HIS pistol.
Zben said something about he\'s willing to do "whatever is necessary" to
	stop the missile from firing, but I got the feeling that he didn\'t
	want to include violence.
Ger rerouted the missile controls to his board.
Etienne engaged all of the safety interlocks.
Meanwhile, it appears that the Aslan somehow deduced that the Kingfisher was
	preparing to fire a missile, and started active EMS scans targeting
	the missile turrent.
Then VOUF got into the act (Wittefield got through to him on the comm) and
	told Jett something like "Stop acting like a holodrama hero, that\'s
	MY job," and told the rest of \'em to stand down.

	...and that\'s about where the log ends... I think they\'re still
debating it..."

Redd doesn\'t even TRY to come up with an answer to THAT. He calls the Bridge.

"Engineering to Captain - we\'ll be ready with full power on your say-so,
any further orders ?"

"Should  anything  happen  to  commander  Ger, Vouf is next in command - I
must  say  I\'ve  some  reservations  about  his  stability  in  stressful
situations  after  the  mess  he made of the Alcyons engineering. I can\'t
remember who\'s next in line after Vouf, but what  it  comes  down  to  is
that  it\'s  *your*  starship,  we\'re  your crew and *you* get to make the
difficult decisions - If judge Jett wasn\'t  being  held  by  some  crazed
hijackers,  he\'d  know  all the legal junk, but you\'re the man in the hot
seat."

Redd: "Does anyone else get the feeling that there\'s something really
important going on, and no-one will tell you a thing about it ? This trip\'s
been nothing but surprises, intrugue and mayhem from the start."

"Redd, my friend," Ralf grimaces, "I\'ve NEVER had ANY doubts that something
really important has been going on and we aren\'t being told a thing about it.
The mission patch should be two eyes peering out from beneath a mushroom
(that\'s a foodplant we used to grow in hyrdoponics back home): kept in the
dark and fed only fertilizer."


 === Kingfisher ===

As the tense situation on the bridge continues, Etienne and Zben notice
a change in the holo-consoles next to them.  Specifically, the gravitic
control slider (in Etienne\'s case) and the missile turret power interrupt
(in Zben\'s case) are now greyed out (instead of brightly illuminated),
indicating that the controls are still present but have been rendered
completely insensitive to input.  In effect, the switches are dead.

As Rigo is addressing the Commander, Zben does a normal, quick scan of
his console. Then, he does a classic `double-take\', and spins around to
face the Commander.


 ==== Kingfisher ===

Since Boarding the Kingfisher, Fitz has been lounging in the passenger
section, idly musing on the best configuration of grav generators for
a sphere world which would minimize field overlap interference.  Since
there\'s a whole Troop of people on board, and most of them crowded onto
the bridge, he\'s confident that they can handle anything that comes up,
and he can take it easy for a while...

After a while, though, he gets bored, and gets up and stretches a bit,
and roots around in the food locker for something to munch on for lack
of anything better to do.  Having found a type protein bar that he
particularly favors, he plops back into his seat.  Fritz has some weird
tastes; most people would find these types of survivial rations impalitable
at best, but Fitz developed a taste for it when he was young and found
a stash of it, and didn\'t have much else to eat on hand...  Now, the
flavor has become almost nostalgic for him.

Brushing away the last crumbs, he flips on a lap display and plugs it in,
and starts idly flips between the different realtime views of the ringworld
and the various constellations of ships from the viewpoints of different
Turnskaad ships.  About this time he also starts flipping the audio output
between different transmission channels.  Not too much going on there either,
so he switches the display to the view of the ringworld from the Kingfisher
and the audio to the bridge intercom to listen in on the approach chatter,
just in time to hear...

    "Keyaho, Command Shuttle. This is Aurora, Bhyarrvouf.
    What SORT of a \'situation\', Mac?"

    "Oh, I don\'t know." Mac voice replies. "The commander has just
    ordered missiles lauch against the ring world. Several members
    disagree, so now some of them have guns out, aimming at god knows
    what. The commander has just transfered the fire control to his
    own seat.  I figure now would be a good time to let you know,
    before a gun fire enrupts and I have to shoot everyone."


Hmmm!  Fritz hunts around with the display and gets the bridge visual
while Vouf gets filled in on the details.  After identifying the cast
of characters and who\'s pointing what weapons at whom, and why, Fritz
decides that discretion is the better part of valor, and heads back to
engineering.  Upon finding *nobody* there, he mutters in German about
deleriction of duty, and gives the systems a cursory once over to to
make sure all is as it should be, and pulling out a console starts
rooting though the power routing documentation for the missle turret
power supply feeds.

After perusing the schematics for a few minutes, Fritz heads for the
forward part of engineering.  Finding the appropriately labelled section
of decking, Fritz sticks his fingers through the deck mesh and pulls it
up to reveal a maze of conduits, pipes, and junction boxes.  He quickly
spots the component he\'s after, a small bumble-bee striped box with a
bright red label.

	"primary weapon systems power junction
		  Fusible buss-bars
	D A N G E R   -   H I G H   V O L T A G E"

Fritz reaches up and grabs an insulated glove off a nearby workbench,
and then gingerly pops the cover off the box, exposing the a trio
of metal fuses, arrayed in a single pack.  Grabbing the pack with
a grippy, he neatly jerks it free.  There\'s a single, bright electrical
arc as the fuse-pack disengages.

"Zowie!"

Fritz quickly replaces the box cover and then the section of decking,
satisfied with his work.  He puts the fuse-pack into the appropriate
spare parts location, and returns to the passenger section, stopping
to check the bridge intercom for any reaction...


 === Paladin ===

"Excuse Mr. Zar, but did you happen to say mutineers aboard the Kingfisher ?"
Azani then looks quizickly at Zar. After getting back an affitrmative, Azani
then sits back in his chair, his hands in his face. He then relaxes and sits
straight up and retains his composure.

"Well friend, isn\'t this little trip full of suprises. All we need now is
pirates and perhaps a battlefleet and then we\'ll really have a naval
adventure..." Azani then continues to monitor the descent to the Ringworld.


 === Alcyon Sickbay ===

Christian breathes VERY deeply, clearly much more relaxed and at ease now
that the crisis has passed. THIS crisis, at least. He strolls over to the
other two patients as his normal compassionate and cheerful self. "Greetings
to you, Mister Tiblisi and Mister Berana. The pair of you have some nasty
bruises, a concussion each, and assorted fractures, but nothing that I can\'t
fix, and I don\'t think I\'ll need more than local anasthetic. So, I am at
your service, gentlemen, for your undoubted questions if you feel able to
talk." Christian pulls over a medical treatment cart, and begins to scan
Lee from head to toe while selecting a spray injector and an ampule of
local.

"I\'m..." Lee begins in a croak and then coughs lightly. "Let me try
that again. I\'m Lee Tiblisi, Assistant Purser of the \'Glory of
Efate\'. We were attacked and something clipped my head and I only
remember bits and pieces after that -- mostly a misjump and a brief
time in the ship\'s lifeboat. I guess we were really lucky to misjump
into this system and get picked up by you. We owe you a lot. Thanks."

Christian checks the readouts above each bed with evident satisfaction.
"Well, gentlemen, it looks like you\'ll only have to stay in bed for a day
or so, just to play it safe and allow those, ah, tender areas of yours a
chance to heal up. Some quiet time should be a relief for you, I would
imagine."

*There are only 2 questions to ask,* thinks Lee, *and knowing where you
are won\'t do you any immediate good.  Do your job.*  After a moment,
Lee asks, "Doctor, did anyone else make it? There were 15 crew and 32
passengers aboard..."

The doctor continues to clean Lee up and looks like he is trying to
figure out how to answer the question when he is presented with a
much larger concern.

=====================================================

 ==== Kingfisher ===

A number of holo-panels on the bridge are configured to either
display fire control status, or to control it outright.  Suddenly
about half of the interface components on each thus-configured
panel go completely dead.  At the same time, the bridge computer
announces:

	*** WARNING *** PARTIAL FIRE CONTROL FAILURE ***
	*** TARGETTING AND LAUNCH SYSTEM IS OFFLINE  ***
	*** MAIN POWER TO MISSILE TURRET INTERRUPTED ***
	*** SOURCE: ENGINEERING ***

As the message airs, Jan holsters his gauss pistol and squats down next
to the wall.  In his mind the situation has gotten better, not worse.

The tension in Lazer\'s eyes also loosens a notch.  The danger of holocaust
has passed, and now it remains to sort the aftermath.  His arms drop to
a pistol rest position, though he retains a double grip.

Upon determining that the warning is real, and finding that the turret
power has beene physically disconnected at the source, Mac beams a
terse message to the Aurora:

_VOUF, SOMEONE JUST PHYSICALLY DISCONNETED TURRET POWER AT THE SOURCE_

Within tens of seconds, there comes a reply.

_EITHER SEVERIN OR SILVMANE. WATCH YOUR BACK, THEY MIGHT TRY AN ARMED
ASSAULT._

Mac quickly responds with:

_I KNOW. THAT\'S WHAT I\'M AFRAID OF. IF IT COMES TO THAT, I DON\'T KNOW
IF I CAN HANDLE THEM BY MYSELF. I\'VE OVERRIDDEN THE TWO CONTROLS I
DISCOVERED. MAYBE THE GRAVITY SWITCH WILL GIVE ME A EDGE._


 === Aurora ===

"Alone against five armed veterans....? You brave little pup...."

Hot tears of shame spring to Bhyarrvouf\'s eyes. They\'ll kill him, he
thinks miserably. And all because I tried to act like a HUMAN, and
talk those morons out of this mess. Well, HUMP that noise! They want
to kick me around for being a Vargr in human\'s clothes, following
that rat bastard Jett instead of an OFFICER whose BOOTS they aren\'t
fit to LICK?! FINE! I can play roughcut too, and my patience is GONE!

There is a flash of brilliant white light, and Bhyarrvouf vanishes.
The Aurora is empty. Moira says, _Bhyarrvouf? Please examine the sensors
quickly. we have another contact in system. Bhyarrvouf?_


 === Kingfisher ===

All eyes are on Count Ger, so everyone is momentarily blinded when he
vanishes in a flash. When their eyes clear, Bhyarrvouf is sitting
where Ger was, both guns drawn and aimed at Yorblin and Lazer.

"Okay, pups," he comments in that awful whisper. "Guns dow--"

At this point, every sensor alarm on the Bridge goes off at once.


 === The R-Alpha system ===

The first hint of danger comes when the sensor alarms on board the
Westwind, Gemini Arbiter, and Alcyon sound.  Densitometers detect
massive distortions in local 3-space, familiar to all experienced
spacers as a very large object, or number of objects, leaving
jump-space.  The disturbance forms almost a curtain spinward of
the Ring, just beyond the large derelict, so recently detected.

Ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five... the number of new mass point-
sources climbs steadily, until finally over sixty discrete targets
register, some of them well over half a million metric tons.

By the time, the gravitic and light propagation allow ships in the
Kingfisher/Trakh cluster to sense the new targets, sensor analysis
on board the closer ships yields far more frightening results.


 === Alcyon ===

Ger suddenly finds himself at the command console on the Alcyon
instead of the Kingfisher.

"Kon Der!"

"Count GER?" Grey blinks in disbelief. "Where\'d YOU come from? Sir, we\'re
in deep shit!"


 === Kingfisher ===

For a fraction of a second the sheer impossibility of the event paralyzes
Rigo\'s completely. Then Byarrvouf\'s awful voice cuts the Ex-inspector\'s
confused thoughts and as pictures of cut-up bodies flashes through his
brain alternating with images of the Kingfisher\'s cabin filled with
equally bloody corpses surrounding a maniac Vargr. There is no time to
consider the risks, weighing the non-existing changes of talking anyone
using that tone of voice out of massacring them all against the slim
chance of downing this survivor of countless battles, the risk of making
himself a target against giving Lazer and the others a chance to cut in,
the chance of survivours being able to save him if he is hit. All these
and many other thoughts are distilled down to a single "Ohhh, SHIT!!!".
And just as every sensor alarm on the Bridge goes off at once, Rigo acts.

Rigo\'s stunner is holstered butt forward on his left side. At all the
training sessions aboard the Alcyon, Rigo has been using his right hand
in a cross-draw. Now he lifts his right hand, clearly empty, and draws
the stunner with his LEFT hand, twisting it into alignment and aiming
straight at Bhyarrvouf. His trigger finger contracts...

...and he suddenly realizes he\'s not holding the stunner any more. The
stunners are typical megacorp issue, more for show than heavy battle
use, and the more serious characters have disdained them in favor of
their own guns. Now Rigo knows why, as the stunner flies from his
sweaty palm, arcs neatly across the room, and hits \'Vouf smack on the
nose.

"Ow!" \'Vouf drops both of the Gauss pistols into his lap and catches
the stunner in one free hand while rubbing his nose with the other. He
then hands the stunner back to Rigo, butt first, grumbling, "Was that
necessary?" He doesn\'t sound much like a psychopath any more-- more
like a Vargr with a bumped nose.

Reacting a bit late, Witfield draws both laser pistol and gauss pistols
out of reflex, in a largely ineffective attempt to cover the entire
bridge for \'Vouf.  Slowly realizing that everyone seems content to
holster their weapons, Witfield does likewise.

A smile appears on his face, "Hey, Vouf. Nice surprise you got here!"

"And what\'s that NOISE all about?" demands \'Vouf.


 === Alcyon Bridge ===

As Ger sits down he touches the intercom button, and then his hands
go to the keyboard. (A holographic simulation in this case).

"All hands to battle stations, Secure for maneuvering. Engineering
I need full maneuver power."

 === Kingfisher ===

\'Vouf\'s flash-appearance startled Etienne so much that almost a full second
passes before he reacts to the newest alarm.  As he spins his chair around
to face his controls, there is the barest hint of a slightly lopsided smile.

With only a very short glance at the incoming sensor data, Etienne says
"Another fleet, sir.  Details coming up in the tank now..."  As the details
of the immense Solomani fleet begin to clarify in front of him, Etienne\'s
hands slow in their frantic movements, until they come to a stop, just
hovering there, over his controls.  A very soft "Merde," however, is his
only comment as his hands resume their play over the controls.

Since \'Vouf\'s arrival, Yorblin has remained in his squatting position,
weapon holstered, in as non-threatening a posture as a person can reasonably
manage without \'assuming the position\'.  Noting that Ger is no longer with
them, he addressed the SubCommander.

"Sir, \'Vouf?............holo heroics, indeed?  Your orders, sir."

With that, Jan raises to his feet, making sure his suit is pressurized and
ready to roll.

Lazer very slowly lowers his pistol to the deck, his two-fisted grip
reduced to a two-fingered one. He stands again, slowly, and kicks the
pistol away from him.

"Sir. I surrender to your authority." Lazer\'s voice is formal, perfectly
controlled; his emotional exhaustion betrays itself only in his eyes. "I
take full responsibility for my actions, and will submit to tribunal.
You have my resignation..."


 === R-Alpha ===

No one has noticed yet that when Ger vanished, so did Jett.

Richard Jett is now standing on a grassy plain, the wind gently whipping
his face. Above him, the horizon stretches upward to embrace the Sun in
a band of blue. No more fighting, no more secrets....Richard Jett has,
in a sense, come home. If the others resolve their differences and join
him, that\'s good; if not, others will come eventually. The point is,
he\'s here now.

*I must deal with these new Visitors,* the Hoop says calmly. *It will be
difficult. They are many, and very hostile. But when I have dealt with
them, we shall talk about our future, you and I.*


 === Trakh ===

Aolrkhea\' stares at the developing scan of _Kingfisher_\'s weapons turret,
her mind working at high speed.  *Wait!  There is a logical reason why the
Darrian would aim at the ringw -- *

At that moment, her densitometer panels go crazy.  The smooth, calm voice
of Fa\'eairl is heard from the main speaker.

_WARNING:  JUMP INCURSION, range approximately 1 AU, many large sources._

Aolrkhea\' immediately looks at the sensor arrays.  "Aiwi, I have about
sixty-four sources exiting hyperspace, plus or minus eight.  About sixteen
have LHyd displacements at or above 525,000 tons [2 million base eight]."

Aiwi\'s hands are again a blur of motion above the instrument panels
she knows so well.  Her attention is fixed on the displays of incoming
data, her gaze darting rapidly among the various sensor and
communication displays.  She spares only the briefest glance toward
the holotank to confirm the situation she has already deduced from
data at her station. "Scanning the fleet on passive arrays," she mutters
with a glance at Aolrkhea\'. "This is no sensor-fake, Admiral. Those ships
are Hisol\'i, and they are VERY real."


 === Gemini Arbiter ===

"What the. . .!" exclaims Aurelia.

Nichole stares at the commo speaker as if a snake had just crawled
out of it.  "Oh No!"

Concentrating feverishly on the helm, Aurelia commands, "Quick Nikki!
Get me as much power as you can!"

Nichole complies with alacrity.  As manual and voice commands rapidly fine
tune the engineering systems to maximum output, she moans, "Oh, I wish we
had a real engineer aboard!"

Giving a quick glance towards Nikki, Aurelia barks, "You\'re doing good.
Now give me 50% more!. . ."


 === Talisman ===

Ralf\'s sensors suddenly flare with multiple incoming wavefronts; ships
coming in. The valuable data he had been gathering, with Doctor Tabor
trying to take readings on him as he and Redd worked, is now obscured
in one part of the sky, but not before a good-sized chunk of information
was gathered for later study. For now, though, it seems that the Talisman
has other problems....

"FUCK!  Are those real?  Waitaminnit... shitshitshit!" Ralf\'s hands and
eyes fly across the boards, looking for spoofing evidence. They find none.


 === Kingfisher ===

Johann has turned when the flash came and is looking at Vouf, his mouth
hanging open when the silence following the cessation of the active scan
alarm is suddenly replaced by an even louder and more obnoxious yell from the
sensor console. The display shows new passive EMS and densitometer contacts
arriving in the system, numbering them and giving them yellow borders for
\'unknown neutral?\' status.

"Arrivals, fifty plus, some heavies. A new bogus fleet?"

He begins to type on the console while on the display red letters saying
\'Contact ID: Type unknown, Nationality: Solomani (60%)\' appear. Then the
transmission arrives...

"...effective whenever you choose to accept it." Lazer smiles wanly. "Shall
I take my duty station, sir?"

Lazer fastens his helmet, but makes no move to retrieve his sidearm until
\'Vouf responds.

A wave of assent is all he receives, as the Subcommander turns away to
face the Helm station. "Action stations, all," he barks. He quickly
reconfigures the panel in front of him... and stops. He looks at something
no one else can see on his display for a long moment, his ears curling
back and a snarl appearing at one lip. Then, with an angry "Sudvok!",
he finishes clearing and reconfiguring the display.

"SEVERIN, PUT THE GUNS BACK ON LINE!"


 === Alcyon Bridge ===

Manfred Werner\'s hand blur over the sensor panel, trying to make
sense of the new contacts.  Morgan Grey has left his pilots seat
and is nervously hovering over Werner\'s shoulder.

"Come on, Doc!  What\'s out there?" demands Grey nervously.  Werner
spares him a withering glance and then concentrates on his board.

"It occurs to me that we would be better served if you attended to
having the engineering crew bring the drives on line, while I analyze
these contacts." snaps Werner.

"Yah, yah, sure.  OK." Grey flops back down in his acceleration couch
and presses his commdot.

"O\'Shi, if you\'re through pestering our CMO, hussle your ass aft and
give Slide a hand.  I think we\'re going to be needing the drives
pretty soon, such as they are."  Then he switches channels and contacts
sickbay.

"Doc, this is Grey.  I think you\'d better strap your patients in, just
so they don\'t get thrown around."  Grey nervously glups for air and
continues, "We got company.  *Lots* of company.  I\'m guessing they\'re
*not* \'friendlies\'."


 === Talisman ===

As J.J. waits for orders, suddenly the Turret holo-target display goes
bonkers, the computer begins adding multiple targets as the Solomani fleet
exits jump.

"What the ..., Shit. Guns to Bridge, Capt. we got a shitload of trouble
here. I got about 60 startships exiting Jump, 1AU distance. Meson guns being
fired at the ring. We are in deep shit, repeat deep shit. I would suggest
getting the hell out of here if we had somewhere else to go. Identity
of fleet is tentatively Solomani. I knew I should have stayed at home."


 === Alcyon Sickbay ===

Lee groans. "Oh no. Not again..."

Christian\'s head snaps up in pure surprise. His mouth opens for half a
second before he realizes the futility of saying anything else without
a better grasp on the situation. With his patients welfare having been
looked after, Christian\'s keen sense of responsibility and duty tells
him that he must act quickly. His head rapidly surveys Sickbay as he
considers the situation. A brief moment of thought ends with a flurry of
action as he checks his vacc suit (underneath his uniform), grabs his
medical carryall, and throws his spare gauss pistol in for good measure.


 === Alcyon Bridge ===

Werner continues his analysis.  "Pater, please pattern match the new
sensor contacts against known spaceframe configuration database.  Are
they starships?  If so, what type?"

Milliseconds pass, a virtual eternity for Pater.  Then he speaks.

_Jump field distortions are fading.  I can now clearly distinguish
sixty-five separate targets.  Sixteen of the targets register
displacements at or above five hundred thousand metric tons.  I have
numerous matches against known starship profiles.  Target composition
is consistent with a large Solomani deep penetration strike fleet.
My analysis of the individual vehicle types is as follows:_

_Two Atlas-class battle tenders, three Aquataine-class battleships, one
Serengeti-class strike carrier, ten Sequoia-class armored cruisers,..._

Dr. Werner\'s eyes narrow as the military litany continues.  Grey wipes
a sheen of sweat from his ashen face and hits the ship-wide commo button,
allowing the rest of the crew to hear the terrifying news.
_...twenty McMurdo-class escort destroyers, one Cassiar-class heavy
cruiser, one Eclipse-class dreadnought, six Buffalo-class fleet tankers,
six Ares-class missile tankers, seven Berkshire-class transport tankers._

"Sweet Mary, mother of God!" whispers Grey.  Werner leans back away from
the console and slides both hands into the deep pockets of his lab coat,
silently staring at the streams of data flowing by.

"Pater," murmurs Grey, "what\'s that *big* one?"

_If the database matches are correct, the largest vessel is an Eclipse-
class strike carrier, with a displacement of seven hundred thousand
metric tons_

"Seven hun..!" falters Grey.  "How many ships does it carry?"

_A fully loaded Eclipse is capable of transporting six-hundred
strike fighters_ replies Pater calmly.

"Slide, O\'Shi, bring the plant to one-hundred percent, RIGHT NOW!"  Grey
ignores Werner as he frantically lays in a course directly away from the
new contacts.

"Pater, get me a secure maser link to the Kingfisher, and then issue
a tight-beam general recall to all ships."  Without looking over his
shoulder, Grey moans to Werner, "I think I\'m a dead man."  Werner\'s
only reply is a slightly raised eyebrow.


 === Phin Shuttle ===

Doejin finishes the last touches to match the trajectory of the Westwind.
Moving to the maintenance station, he implements the initiating procedures
for the maintenance arms.

"Well, not what they were completely designed for," he thinks, "but they
should do the trick if I help a little."  His flukes and mind control dance
over the operating panels and sturdy mechanical arms begin extending toward
the adjacent Westwind.  Suddenly...

In the midst of their conversation and rendezvous with the Westwind,
the stentorian voice of the Ring interrupts Ian and the two Phins.

*FERDY! DOEJIN! IAN! THIS IS AN EMERGENCY! You must abandon the
shuttle at once.  I am opening two gates for you-- I have no time for
more. The left one leads to the Surface, and the right one leads to
one of the Visitors\' ships. You must leave through them immediately--
I am afraid that the Visitors\' stay will not be prolonged any
more....*

Two archways flash into being. Beyond one, Ian sees the drab common room
of the Talisman, with Dave Sokuku still looking dazedly at where Ian
had vanished a few minutes ago. Beyond the other, there is the welcoming
surface of the Ring-- so close, and yet so far.....

Doejin looks from the familiar surface of the only universe he\'s ever
known to the myteries of his new friends the Visitors, and he makes
a decision....

In a state of shock and bewildement...

"No, to be this close to such wonderment and excitement...."

Doejin gives a mental flick to the suit and slowly moves toward the
arch-- not to the Ring but to the Talisman.


 === Alcyon Sickbay ===

Christian fires off a last salvo of instructions. "Lucan, attend to these
two patients here; Dulinor, monitor the surgical patient; both of you,
coordinate with Triple Three and keep an eye on Tweel. Take all necessary
actions and report to me if necessary. Secure all patients for combat
conditions, including vacc suits!"

He motions frantically to OSF. "Carry me to the main Engineering control
area, NOW!" The ungainly warbot scoops Christian up and the two of them fly
out of Sickbay at an amazing rate of speed, through the grav lifts and lengthy
corridors of the Alcyon, with Christian hanging on to a tentacle and silently
cursing the new, dangerous intruders, all the while listening to updates on
his commdot.


 === Alcyon Bridge ===

_Doctor Werner,_ says Pater, _I am detecting a very large number of thermal
blooms from the new contacts._  On the senor console a digital counter
begins to tally the new energy sources.  Within seconds the total number
is well into five digits and shows no sign of slowing it\'s climb.  Pater
continues, _I am also detecting low-level neutrino emissions from a
significant portion of these new contacts.  Predictive plots show that
the new contacts will impact the surface of R-Alpha in staggered waves.
The first wave will intersect the Ring in three minutes, forty-four
seconds_

Less than a minute later, a flashbulb-like light snaps on through the bridge
viewscreens, and slowly fades.  As the light fades, Grey stands and looks
for the source.  "Somebody in that general vicinity just got toasted."  He
states.  "It must have been pretty good sized to see at over one AU."

Pater immediately reacts to the event.  _I am detecting a sharp spike
in high-energy particles.  Alpha, Beta, and neutron flux at the approximate
distance of the new energy source would suggest the activation of a fusion
weapon in the one-hundred megaton range.  I can no longer detect the
derelict orbiting R-Alpha_


 === Kingfisher ===

>From the number one gunnery station, Abdul Schmud exclaims, "Shit!  That\'s
the largest blast I\'ve even seen!"  After a brief pause, he adds (in a much
more dejected tone), "Somebody has a grudge against us."


 === Paladin ===

Just outside the Paladin\'s fresher door (still open), one can hear the
splashing of running water, and a few assorted gurglings.  Then, a heavy
sigh.

Charyn emerges from the fresher, still shaky but looking much stronger.
She walks gingerly but determinedly toward the bridge, taking deep
breaths.  Her brow is creased from the now-dull pounding in her head.
She doesn\'t miss the Ziru Sirkaa that halted after her little experience
in the restroom. *Sandpaper, vinegar and sandpaper. Ecch*

Aboard the bridge, the sensors come to life and the computer laconically
reports the new contacts throughout the Paladin\'s PA.  Charyn attempts
to furrow her brow further, and moves to a normal walking pace.  The
count of contacts continues and she hastens her walk -- tough, but at
least the shakiness is passing.

The intruder size estimates begin to roll in...  On the bridge, Zar et
al are listening intently to the reports and a major part of the crew\'s
shocked attention is focused on the main sensor holo.  The iris screaks
open and Charyn hustles in, just as the actinic FLASH clicks.  Momentarily
blinded, she stops dead still just inside the iris, swaying slightly.

Charyn moves fluidly to the commo station and dons the commset, an
expressive frown of disbelief cast in her face.  The computer begins
a verbal report an analysis of the flash and is interrupted by an
incoming commo signal.


 === Westwind ===

Talon watches as a large cluster of new ships appear on the Westwind\'s
sensors.

"Sheesh.  It looks like everyone who wasn\'t here already has arrived
now.  I wonder who this bunch----  Shit!  Was that a nuclear detonation!?"

"I\'m not sure, Nicholas, but it looks very worrying."

"I don\'t like the look of this, either, Shurv."

+++ incoming transmission +++

Talon turns to observe the commo panel.  "I think the newcomers are
about to announce themselves.  OK, computer, let\'s have it."


 === The R-Alpha system ===

Within thirty seconds of the nuclear detonation, a broadcast message is
received by every commo set in the vicinity of the Ring.  The holo-tanks
show a rather sharp-featured man with a crewcut, wearing the uniform of
a Solomani Navy commander.

"This is Commander Joop Croetze-de Vries, adjutant to Admiral Helmut
Dietrich, commanding officer of the 211th Fleet of the Solomani
Confederation Navy.  This star system, it\'s occupants, and all space
vessels are now under the control of the Solomani occupation forces.
Ground-based weapon systems are instructed to immediately de-energize
and await the arrival of Solomani peacekeeping forces.  Spacecraft
currently in system are directed to immediately de-energize all weapons
and cut maneuvering drives, in preparation for boarding by inspection
teams.  Failure to immediately comply with *any* of these directives
will be met with the harshest penalties.  Stand by your communications
systems for further instructions."  The image instantly fades from the
holo-tank.

Simultaneously, the far edge of the ringworld begins to sparkle like
a childs quartz necklace.  At the same time, popcorn blasts of static
blast from the commo system speakers, in perfect unison with the
glitter.  Many crewmembers with military experience recognize the
sight, and sound, of a massive meson gun barrage when it occurs.
No one, however, has *ever* seen one that spans an area the size
of several entire planetary surfaces.

 === Kingfisher ===

With a sharp indrawn breath, Johann freezes in position. "How in anybodys
name did *that* damn crypto-SSMM\'er, crypto-Heiter and crypto-Sanctaterrist
get into the SCN?!!"

The console doesn\'t answer him, it just continues to spew out data on the
nuclear explosion, the newly arrived ships and the meson barrage.

"We\'re all going to die!" moans Abdul.  "They don\'t take prisoners."

No one can see the expression on Lazer\'s face, hidden behind the helmet
faceplate.


 === Talisman ===

Shrike listens intently to the message, toward the end he can be
heard quietly muttering, "unbelievable, un_fucking_believable".

As the message ends Shrike looks over at Thul, "Well Thul, which way
jumping, is it going to be run or hide?  Because I sure as hell ain\'t
gonna just sit here and wait for em."

"Redd, Ralf, get everything up to full power I think we\'re going to
need it real soon."

"Nishu, plot us the quickest course outta here and away from them and
then prep another that\'ll take us down to ring."

"Niigurd, either you or Sokuku try to pull up as much data as you can
on the Solomani fleet.  See if we have a chance in hell of getting outta
here."

"Thul, heard anything from Ger of Vouf yet?  Any orders?  Anything?"

Thul shakes his head grimly.


 === Trakh ===

The visuals show the far edge of the Ring begin to sparkle with the single
and double flashes of meson gun fire.  In mounting horror and disbelief,
Aolrkhea\' focuses an auxiliary sensor platform on the target zone to get
a closer look.  At this early stage, the barrage is so intense that little
more can be seen than the green fields, lush woods, bright deserts, and
glittering waters in the target area disappearing forever behind a curtain
of blasts and clouds.

"Tiya," Aolrkhea\' whispers softly.  Nuclear death.

Aolrkhea\' has been in the Khaukeairl Space Navy for over twenty years.
She has seen death from patients exposed indirectly to meson and nuclear
attack.  Radiation poisoning.  The smell of charred flesh.  The fur and
flesh burned off or fused to the victims, hanging in gobbets and strips
from their pain-wracked bodies.  Sometimes they were blinded, and the pus
ran down out of the empty eye sockets of the patient, down their charred
face.  All their fur falling out, until they were as naked as a wyukhui.
Strange symptoms a human would call "flu-like", and gangrenous infections.
Injuries that wouldn\'t heal.  The mewling of the victims.  Sometimes,
there was uncontrollable and massive internal hemhorraging, followed by
death.

Sometimes, somehow, they survived.

An area the size of worlds is laid waste before her stunned eyes.  Half-
rising in her seat restraints, she bares her teeth slightly and begins
to whisper viciously, softly, at the inferno below and the mocking stars
beyond.

"Akyafteirleao hisol\'iya\'uist, ki i\'hkohai, ki rukhtiywe...."


 === Talisman ===

"Oh ghod..." Ralf\'s voice is a terrified whisper.


 === Paladin ===

A forest fire sparks in Charyn\'s dark green eyes, the frown vanishes,
and she hesitates, but just for a second.  Then she beings mumbling in
her commo headset and her arms move speedily over the configured display,
the actions precise and calculated, austere.  Within seconds, she has
requested a "best guess" from the computer for the nearest star system
with acceptable wilderness refueling, then begun a Nav\' calculation to
jump there.  The calculation is optimized for a quick solution, rather
than high exit point accuracy.

She maintains observation of the Commo, Nav calc, drive and passive ECM
status.  Her expression is one of sour expectation, tinged with urgency.
At the instant Joop completes his statement, her attention still riveted
on her display, Charyn loudly and clearly states: "Captain! I have begun
a rapid jump Nav solution.  You may request a drive prep at once".

A spark of imagination so rare among her friends erupts with hope.  Dies
with a popcorn crackle.  "Starship Tactical Manual, Volume 7 Standard
Practices.  Chapter 7, Hostile Encounters.  Section 18: Escape Avenues."
*There\'s nothing here*

Charyn\'s eyes glaze over for a second, then she turns and looks at \'Zar.
Her speech is distinct and filled with resignation: "Captain? Cancel
that statement... all options are coming up as inadvisable."

"One.  There are no star systems close enough to attempt a jump.

"Two.  The survey equipment indicates ZERO suitable bodies in this star
system for refueling.

"Three.  The equipment sets an upper survivability bound, to find fuel
after a random jump to the Oort cometary region, to less than five
percent."

She clenches her teeth together and turns to stare at a region of her
personal console, the title still emblazoned at the top of the page.
There\'s nothing here... nothing here... nothing here.

She turns to look at \'Zar.  Her head is pounding, mouth pasty and dry as
a cold french fry.  "Captain.  Unless you know of a way to get out of
here fast like that fancy alien shuttle does, I advise we either attempt
to hide from their sensors, or... surrender."


 === Phin Shuttle ===

Doejin gives Ian an affirmative flick of the fluke along with a
telepathic nod and his course to the Talisman arch is completed.

A slight sense of vertigo and one quick look back for nostalgia
and... *The Hoop under ATTACK?!? NOO!!!* and he is through.

The quick anxiety of the Hoop in danger quickly subsides as the
new surroundings become apparent and secure in the knowledge that
nothing as small as the *Solomani* fleet could even begin to harm
the Hoop or his friends in the oceans or his new friends, the Visitors.

With that, he slowly turns in his hover and examines his new home and
faces his second Visitor feeling as surprised as Doejin is curious.


 === Talisman ===

Ralf\'s eyes glaze over for the briefest moment, then he snaps back
to reality.

"Bridge, I can\'t make the numbers work, maybe one of you nav types can.  I
think we\'re stuck in-system.  Two options:  we can try to microjump to the
other side of the system, hopefully somewhere the Ring or the star will
hide us.  Or we can try to hide out here.  With this ship I don\'t know, but
they\'re throwing out enough EM noise of their own to drown out a parade..."

Ralf leaves the elint on auto and concentrates on helping Redd prepare for
whatever may come, muttering as an afterthought "Of course we can always
blind-jump and HOPE we find fuel..."

=====================================================

 === Kingfisher ===

Daniel Silvmane is happy as a pig in mud. The sensor suite of the Kingfisher
is reeling in data in reams, and his hands are in constant motion over
the holodynamic panel he set up for himself in the Common Room. Headphones
blare the latest record from Near Miss ("Dance of Fools," currently banned
by the realms of Lucan, Dulinor, Strephon, and Margaret, with the Ziru
Sirkaa and the League of Antares soon to follow) in his ears as he immerses
himself in the unending display of fascinating trivia about the Ring....

The sensor system was set up for him by Johann Abuko, with the approval of
Count Ger. It is totally passive, and completely disconnected from anything
that might affect the operation of the Kingfisher in a crisis. The many
alarms and telltales were getting annoying, so he turned them off....

Wait until Ralf sees this, he thinks to himself. I hope the sensors on
the Talisman are up to snuff-- if we can triangulate on some of these
phenomena, we can map out the whole--

Suddenly his reverie is broken by a coruscating flash of light from across
the Ring, temporarily blinding the light-collector arrays. "Huh?"

He scans the readouts. Multiple Jump exits, fusion sources, meson fire....

He frowns and switches off the music, turning around. "Hey, Fitz--"

Severin is gone. Dan gets up and makes his way forward.

Stepping onto the Bridge, he pushes Lazer\'s gun barrel aside with a
finger and says, "Has anyone noticed that we have company? Oh, hi,
\'Vouf. Um, why\'s everybody running around?"

"GET your UGLY pink KEESTER BACK on those SENSORS," Vouf snarls without
turning around. He glances at Abuko. "Sounds like you KNOW this guy, A.P."


 === Gemini Arbiter ===

Startled out of her concentration, Nikki yells, "Huh!? 50%!"  Then
the content of the radio message begins to sink in.

"Solomani!"  Glancing at Aurelia, she asks, "What\'s your plan?"

Still programming the helm at breakneck speed, Aurelia replies,
"Maybe we can get to a large body of water and hide."

Nichole nods, "Or at least get the Ring between us and them. Good idea."

"Yeah." agrees Aurelia.  "Now only if it works!"

"Well," offers Nikki, "we can always say we got over excited and pressed
the wrong buttons!"

Aurelia arches her eyebrows as she rapidly scans the info streaming from
the sensors.  "Right. I\'m SURE they\'ll believe us!"

Checking the engineering displays, Nikki says, "We won\'t be able to hold
   this output much longer."

"How long?" asks Aurelia.

Nikki taps out a quick calculation.

"Long enough to get to the Ring."


 === Talisman ===

In the midst of trying to make sense of the gunnery data coming in, J.J.
notices a flash from the secure-cam holo-display. He glances at it and there
in the picture is a dolphin. And it is on-board the Talisman. "Security to
Capt. INTRUDER ALERT! INTRUDER ALERT! we have been board by a dolphin,
present location Engineering. Where do you want me Thul, with the guns
or do I go get the fish?"


 === Alcyon Maneuver Drives ===

"If I live through this day, I\'ll never sign on another damn hazduty
contract again, I SWEAR!" Slide Wrinkley is running like a maniac
between the main Jump Drive controls and the Power Plant. As his hands
fly across the controls, easing the plant on line and preparing to
charge the Jump grid, he mutters to himself nonstop.

"Goddamn it Grey, once in a while I\'d like to put this baby through a
Jump WITHOUT having to crash charge the Zuchai crystals! We barely
patched together the fuel lines after the LAST time, and..." He slams
a fist down on the commo panel. "O\'SHI, GETCHER BUTT *DOWN* HERE ALREADY!"

The voice that replies is smug. "Can\'t. Confined to quarters."

Slide\'s eyes bulge. "BY *WHO*, FOR SET\'S SAKE?!"

"Chief Medical Officer. He ranks you an\' Grey, man. An\' he really DID
pop inta Sickbay outa nowhere...."

"Doesn\'t surprise me," Grey\'s voice cuts in shakily. "Count Ger just
poofed onto the Bridge. Attention, all hands-- CO on the Bridge."

"Whattayamean, just POOFED!" Slide runs down the status logs with a
fingertip as he continues to bring systems on line. "Well, get him to
gimme back O\'Shi, or \'poof\' Bhyarrvouf or Abuko or Silvmane or
SOMEBODY! We had barely enough manpower to do this in a hurry LAST
time, and that was with the Anslinger covering our butts--"

He stops dead on that thought. In his mind, he remembers a flash of
exploding hydrogen, fired by the other Turnskaad ships to cover
the Alcyon\'s escape....hydrogen meant for the Alcyon....

He whirls to the main fuel-tank monitor system, and tabulates the
ullage rapidly. His eyes squeeze shut, as if he\'d just received
a painful injection in a tender spot, and he slumps into a chair.

"Bridge," he whispers, "Tell the Commander that stunt with the
exploding fuel at the last jump point cost us thirty percent of
our go juice. We\'re sitting at about three-hundred-fifty thou.
That\'s enough to jump us about three parsecs...but not enough
to make the rendezvous."

"We\'re stranded...."


 === Trakh ===

Nerves, tempered and battle-hardened, trained by a lifetime of military
tradition, respond within milliseconds to the call of the warrior, yet
in this moment of crisis Akhouw calmly takes charge. The low pitch and
sharp tone of his voice are the only indicators of his internal stress.

In a blur, his right claw stabs down, activating the panic button. The
lighting changes instantly to the subdued reddish hues of combat lighting
and in the background a klaxon begins to sound general quarters.

He snaps off an order to Aolrkhea\'. "Engage EM cloak! Order for_Khaurl_:
Engage cloak, execute maximum thrust rendesvouz with _Trakh_."

Akhouw throws an order at Aiwi. "Speeder emergency recall! Begin nav
calcuations for jump, best wilderness refueling point!"

The claw shifts a centimeter to the left, activating the intercom.
"Aeawiyh, full combat power, NOW!"

Then a last, more ominous order. "Fa\'eairl. Missile load, nuclear
magazine."


 === Alcyon Jump Drives ===

Aaron haut-Frieder is running like a madman down the corridors of the
Alcyon. He\'s in good shape, his muscles toned but not bulging, his
blonde hair and thick walrus mustache flying behind him. It\'s easy
to see that he\'s in good shape, because he\'s almost naked. Only a
pair of black boxer shorts lie between him and an indecency charge;
he only threw THOSE on after Slide\'s screaming woke him up because
he knew Pater would film his flight and that Ger and \'Vouf would
do a crew-efficiency review of the tapes later....

He skids to a barefoot stop at the iris valve to the main Jump Drive
monitor area, several decks above where Wrinkley is battling the
Power Plant, and opens the door. "Slide," he pants as he jumps into
a chair, "This is Aaron. I\'m on station in the Jump area-- yell if
you need me and can\'t get anyone else."

A tiny wind tickles Aaron\'s mustache. He frowns and looks puzzled
for a moment, then shrugs and runs a hand through his mustache to
calm the itch as he sets to work. Another breeze, stronger than
the last, ruffles his hair, but he ignores it....


 === Phin Shuttle ===

Ian grabs Doejin forcefully on the fluke or fin, or just about
anything going past him.

*WAIT!  JUST A SECOND! Doejin, if you\'re going with the humans, take this
message to Judge Jett: (This is *IMPORTANT*!)  Tell him the crystals in my
chamber are NOT to fall into the hands of people who shoot first.  Tell him
to destroy them if he has to to keep them away from whoever just got here.
Here is my Turnskaad ID, so he will know the message is from me, and
only he will know the codes (to use with it) to get the info from
those crystals.*

Ian smiles.

*I must stay behind and do what I can help the Hoop.  That\'s why I\'m
here.  If we should never meet again, I am enriched by these few
minutes. Now -- GO!*

And Ian pushes himself through the other at almost the same instant,
hoping like hell he doesn\'t wind up 200 m underwater.

There is a shift in gravity, and suddenly a cool, sweet wind is ruffling
Ian\'s hair. A calm, placid voice-- more calm than it had ever been heard
on the Alcyon-- greets Ian.

"Oh, hello, Ian. It\'s good to know I won\'t be alone on this trip."

Ian turns and faces Richard Jett, and breaks into a wide grin. "Yes, it is,"
he agrees. "Let\'s find a place to spend the night, and then get moving.
I expect Ferdy will catch up to us after he checks in, but in the meantime
it\'s getting on toward Sunfade...."


 === Yori/Regina - Date: 249-956 ===

"T minus two-hundred forty seconds and counting,"  Announced the
loudspeaker, "All systems reporting nominal.  Tertiary interlocks
disengaged."

A large chronometer placed on the wall of the laboratory confirmed
the announcement.  The number continued to descend, but none of the
technicians seemed to pay much attention to it.  Although there was
no obvious sign of stress or foreboding in the expressions or actions
of any of the personnel, the tension was definitely there.  The heavily
armed Imperial Marines surrounding the room betrayed the importance of
the process at hand.

Vigorous streams of data poured forth from the various terminals and
hard-copy printers around the room.  A green light indicated that all
systems were \'go\', but one observer was skeptical.  Checking his hand
computer, which was  directly linked into the tactical and security
network, the figure frowned to see that there were no irregularities
reported.  Unconvinced, except by his own eyes, the man in the uniform
bearing the markings of a lieutenant commander and sporting the name
"Greyson" on the name tag left the lab to make one last round in the
security perimeter before the test was executed.

Placing an identification card into a slot by the door, he stared into
a beam of red light.  Three seconds later, the panel above the slot
where he placed his card read:

                Greyson, Darrow
                Lt. Commander
                Security clearance:  Alpha Primus
                Identity verified

                ACCESS GRANTED

After which, the door slid open, revealing that it was composed of a
twenty centimeter-thick bonded superdense alloy.  Greyson passed through
the portal, which then promptly resealed, it\'s magnetic locks audibly
reengaging.

He checked his watch.  There were still a few minutes left for him to
make his rounds in the secured corridor.  Checking his hand computer, he
was not entirely please to see that he was the only entity registering in
the area.  Despite his equipment, he knew that something was amiss.  He
had a highly developed intuition for these things.  If he sensed something
were wrong, then he would believe his gut instinct over any mere piece of
machinery, no matter how sophisticated or \'fail-safe\'.

Greyson inspected every possible point of entry, checked every security
sensor.  There were no flaws . . . yet.  Although many of his compatriots
discounted it, Greyson believed that he had a sort of precognizant
ability;  A sort of clairvoyance into the future.  It was nothing of the
psionic hokus-pokus that the press was so busy maligning.  He had dealt
with the Zhodani.  He knew them to be honorable.  They would not be the
ones to attack the Imperium while it was weak.  If any attack was to come,
it would be from the perennially restive Solomani.  Their politics of
racial supremacy were dangerous because they were so intoxicating to
so many normally rational people.

"Thirty seconds until test.  All personnel prepare for primary safety
interlock release."

The man mentally chastised himself for falling into daydreaming.  This
had never happened to him before while on so important a duty.  Dismissing
the transgression to fatigue, he consoled himself with the thought that,
after the test was complete, he could relax.  At that  moment,however,
he realized that he would have to hurry if he was to get back to the
laboratory in time.

As he was heading down one of the corridors, he felt a presence behind
him.  In one lightning-fast action, he drew his specially-balanced 9mm
autopistol, wheeled around, dropped to a squat while levelling his weapon,
and shouted into his headset.

"Priority one!  Security team to secured perimeter!  Repeat, security
team to secured perimeter!"

Suddenly, all went red.  The base went on to top alert.  Greyson
plastered himself to the wall of the corridor as he crept down the
direction of the disturbance.  He knew that something had been wrong
with the security system.  Within fifteen seconds, the entire security
perimeter was filled with Marines, some equipped with battledress, others
with flak jackets.  All had gauss rifles.

The final countdown was underway.  Neither Greyson nor his troops had
found anything yet.  Then, just as he heard the loudspeakers announce
that the test was proceeding, and that the primary interlocks had been
released, a corporal shouted, "look out!" while making a dive toward
the lieutenant commander.

Greyson could not discern what happened after that.

It was as if everything had been turned inside out.  There was a
flash of white; a gut-wrenching feeling.  His body was being torn apart.
Every blood vessel in him felt like there were about to burst.  His heart
felt as if it would explode, were it not for the kevlar flak jacket he
was wearing.

Then, all was calm . . .

Visions passed before him:  His mother and father reading to him one
night . . .  His grandmother visiting the family one weekend . . .  His
girlfriend on the night of the Graduation Dance . . .  His brother\'s
horribly burned body and the painful expression in his eyes . . . His
sister crying at the starport . . .

His sister crying at the starport.  That was the vision that remained
with him, if only for a moment.


 === Phin shuttle ===

Ferdy looks on with a feeling close to despair as he watches Doejin
disappear through one portal and then Ian through the other.  Whichever
way he chooses, he will have lost one of his friends, perhaps forever.

 * The Visitors are leaving?  So soon?  No time to even meet them all?
   This is getting worse all the time. *

He hangs there for a long moment, looking back and forth from one
portal to the other.

 * Well, I\'ve got to make a decision... *

Ferdy makes a long and not very pleasant noise through his blowhole.

 * Darn it, I\'m too old to go off splashing about the cosmos.  The
   Great Hoop is my ocean, and that\'s where I\'m going to die. *

With a flick of his tail and a mental prod at his skysuit, Ferdy darts
straight through the centre of one of the portals.

 * Ian!  Wait for me...! *

The portal shrinks to nothingness behind him, and the Phin shuttle is
empty.


 === Westwind ===

Nick Talon and Hur\'Shurvan watch the Phin shuttle on their bridge displays,
as it slows and maneuvers for docking.  Less then one hundred meters are
left between the two spacecraft and the distance continues to shrink.

The Westwind\'s sensors continue to dump data on the invasion fleet into
the ship\'s computer for later analysis.  Only a few scant seconds have
passed since a flash of light and wave of hard radiation heralded the
conversion of the unexplored derelict in highly charged plasma.

Talon and Shurv listen silently to the Solomani diatribe.  When it ends,
Talon lets out a long, low groan.  "My mother warned me there\'d be days
like this.  I never believed her.  I wonder if--"

Suddenly, without any warning, the Phin shuttle pirouettes on its center
of mass, in a move that almost appears fast-forward.  Changing its heading
with close to one hundred and eighty degree yaw, the shuttle engages what
must be its maneuver drive.  In a pulse of glaring ultraviolet light,
the shuttle recedes from the Westwind at well over fifty Gees.

Talon whirls to look out of the viewport, as the Phin shuttle suddenly
veers away and shoots off at immense speed.

"Freeeow!  I think our hosts just left us in the lurch.  Incredible
ship, though, isn\'t it?"

"Umm, Nicholas..."

"I\'d love to get my hands on one of those."

"Excuse me Nicholas, but..."

"What a mover!  It must--  What is it, Shurv?"

"Nicholas, what do you suppose that is, dead ahead of us?"

"What?  Oh, it\'s just a thirty meter glowing disk that we\'re about
to crash into."

"Oh."

Before Talon or Shurv can react, the large glowing disk quickly sweeps
over the scout-ship and devours it.


 === Trakh ===

"Aye, sir," Aiwi nods, beginning to assemble a course for.... she stops.
"Admiral," she says quietly, "Wilderness refuel beyond the Ring is not
possible. This system has no other fuel sources. Suggest we attempt a
landing at once."

Aiwi calls up the Ring\'s frequency on the audio comm panel as she frantically
attempts to assemble a course toward the Ringworld. "Calling the entity
known as Iasic! This is the Trakh, requesting guidance on an evasive
course to the surface of the Ring and the location of a safe landing zone!"

There is no answer....


 === Alcyon Jump Drives ===

Aaron haut-Frieder is slaving away at the Jump console, trying to coax
recently-dormant systems to life, when he feels the breeze again.  It\'s
stronger this time, and cold.

He turns around, and looks suspiciously out over the vast expanses of
the Jump Drives, and the open room where \'Vouf did his ice-dancing act,
and poor MT died, and Leadfoot nearly killed everyone.  If some lingering
bit of sabotage hadn\'t been caught....

He sighs.  A vacuum leak would produce a steady wind, not gusts.  "I must
be imagining things," he says, and returns to the console.

A tiny sound jerks him around in his seat-- the sound of a spark arcing
across a gap.  It was tiny, but unmistakeable.  Frowning, he flicks the
com unit on.  "Slide, this is Aaron. Hold off on routing me power or
fuel just yet.... I may have a problem up here."

Another spark-sound, from behind him. He whirls in place, but it\'s gone.
"Correction," he says. "I DEFINITELY have a problem here."


 === R-Alpha ===

Hfolraw manages a slight smile as the Aorlakht-class speeder makes a low,
tight turn around a clump of trees.  A slight break in the tangle of
brush ahead is the only place the native should be able to maneuver his
mount through the wall of heavy foliage.  *He\'ll have to come to us!*,
thinks Hfolraw, and the smile grows.  Hryawi will have her specimen to
interrogate, which will please her.  And if she is pleased, the Admiral
will be pleased.

Quietly, the speeder settles into the grassy clearing.  Almost on cue,
Grob and his terrified gara crash out of the brush, only a dozen meters
in front of the Aslan craft.

*I have you now!* exhorts Hfolraw mentally, as he quickly opens the
speeder hatch and rises from his seat.  A flash of light underfoot
causes him to suddenly shield his eyes as he steps out of the small
recon vehicle...


 === Trakh ===
                 ... and onto the cold, hard deck of the speeder
hangar of the Trakh.

"Hleea!!" exclaims Hfolraw.  "What trick is this!?!"  Hryawi sits
stunned in the passenger seat of the speeder and only now it beginning
to take note of her new surroundings.  A single whispered oath escapes
her lips, the Aslan equivalent of "HOLY SHIT!!"

Hfolraw nervously glances about the hangar, as if searching for the
owner of the unseen hand that snatched them across thousands of kilometers
of space.  In a ritual move as old as Aslan history, he drops to one
knee and bows his head.

"Khaofiy," he intones.  "I submit to the stronger force."  Then slowly
rising to his feet, he reaches for his commdot.

"Bridge, Hfolraw.  Something has just returned us to the speeder
hangar."  Hfolraw pauses, realizing that in flight, he has no duty
station,  and that his stateroom in the pinnace is a little far to
walk.  "Permission to come to bridge?"

Hryawi slowly opens the hatch on her side and gingerly steps from
the still vehicle.  "The technology..." she murmurs, then falls
silent, totally at a loss for words.

Hfolraw ponders the power that could teleport the speeder and its crew
across that distance.  Once he earned a place as an officer in the
Emperor\'s Aslan Guard.  Since he renounced his allegiance to an
Imperium that no longer existed, he has had to fight battles no less
vicious, if not as bloody, to earn a place in the Hierate, and as
a member of his new clan.  He has yet to meet an enemy he did not
feel he could master.  Yet now this scarred veteran trembles slightly
as he awaits his commander\'s reply.


 === Alcyon Jump Drives ===

"What kind of problem?" Slide demands over the intercom.

The wind brushes Aaron\'s mustache again.

"Dunno...." Aaron frowns. "Lingering damage from Leadfoot\'s little
ballet with Our Vargr of the Flying Fists?  Sabotage?  I\'ve got what
*sounds* like static discharge activity somewhere.  Intermittent but
getting worse...."

"HELL\'S BELLS! I\'M ON MY WAY UP!" As Slide clicks off, Aaron notices
the wind again... a gust of crosswind, from a direction where there
was no vent grating....


 === Alcyon Maneuver Drives ===

The door to main Engineering slides open to reveal a most unusual sight:
Doctor Van Der Merwe being held gently but firmly in the tentacles of a
warbot. Christian lightly hops to the ground as the odd couple crosses into
the room; OSF-4 hovers in the background as unobtrusive as it is possible
for a warbot to be.

Christian dashes for the control station, offering a short greeting to
Slide as he slides into the next seat. "Hello, Mister Winkley, we\'re
short of crew, so I\'m here to help matters out." He frowns in concern
as he looks at the main holomonitors, then with a few quick taps on his
controls, establishes a link with the bridge sensors and sets up a
secondary tactical status holo, so that he can keep abreast of the
tactical situation.

"VDM to Ger." barks Christian.  "Am in control of Engineering.  Full
maneuver power, aye.  Will advise as thrusters come online.  Am monitoring
tactical situation from down here.  Good luck.  VDM out."

As he finishes his message to the bridge, Christian turns to see
Wrinkley hustling for the door.

"Damn glad to see you, Doc." exclaims Slide.  "I gotta run.  Frieder
got a problem in Jump Engineering and we don\'t need the J-drives crapping
out on us now."  As he hits the doorway, he pauses and adds, "And, by
the way.  It\'s \'Wrinkley\', not \'Winkley\'!"  Then he\'s gone.


 === Talisman ===

Kimball Redd, sitting at a rury-rigged second acceleration  couch,  where
the  engineering  console  was  originally  designed  for  just  the  one
engineer, stops in surprise  as  the  fleet  & explosions  light  up  the
sensor  displays.  His  fingers idly wander over the controls, calling up
system status for various parts of the ship, while his mind is trying  to
come to terms with this latest shock.

Resignation  shows in his face, his shoulders slump & he sighs deeply. He
looks round at Ralf and the Doctor:

"Time to go, I think."


 === Alcyon Jump Drives ===

"Pater," Aaron barks.  "Run back the securecam a minute or two. Where
did those arcs come from?"

_I have no visual record of the first.  The second came from the Number
Eight Panel._

"Number Eight... hell, that\'s the fuel feed system!" Aaron strides over
to the panel and begins undoing an access plate.  He freezes when he
hears another arc, from behind him.  "Pater," he calls, "Where was THAT?"

_Panel Number Four,_ Pater replies easily.

"That\'s clear across the room! How--" Aaron never finishes his
sentence.  Another spark arcs across the panel near his face, and he
jerks away from it instinctively, dropping the access plate with a
clang.  He begins to slowly back away, tense, searching for the
slightest noise, the briefest glimmer....

The wind returns, gusting harder this time.  Aaron shivers, and turns--

"Hey!"

"YIKES!" Aaron leaps a foot in the air and whirls to face Slide, who\'s
just come running in.  Slide skids to a stop and appraises Aaron
critically.  "Nice jammies," he snickers.

"You have a problem with my underwear, MISTER Wrinkely?" Aaron says
with a nobleman\'s sneer, towering over the smaller man. The rising
wind blows his long hair about him like a banner.

"No," Slide laughs.  "Whatever turns y--" His eyes bug out and he stares
past Aaron.  "What the hell----?"

Aaron turns around, and sucks in his breath in surprise.  Other sparks
are leaping from place to place on the machinery, fizzling and vanishing.
The wind is now steady, blowing at them from the center of the room, and
getting stronger by the second.  It doesn\'t smell like ship\'s air, either--

"Hey! What\'s that SMELL?" Slide gasps.  "Not just ozone...."

"It\'s like... SAND," Aaron frowns.  "DESERTS smell like that. Arid, dry..."


 === Paladin ===

Goughzar barely has time to grab for the holo-console and throw an
arm across his face, in a futile attempt to shield himself, and by
extension his ship, from the glaring disk which suddenly looms directly
ahead.  Before \'Zar can even begin to attempt a breaking maneuver, the
disk is gone.  This is the first thing he notices.  The second thing is
the Alcyon, floating serenely off the port beam, less than two hundred
meters away.


 === Alcyon Jump Drives ===

"Pater," Slide whispers, "You recording this?"

_Yes,_ Pater replies.  _My recording apparatus is suffering from some
interference, however.  The picture quality may be poor._

"Engineering!" Grey\'s voice sounds desperate.  "The Commander wants--"

"SHADDUP, GREY!" Slide howls.  "We got sumpin\' WEIRD going on down here!"

"Pater, put the securecam on the Bridge holo!" Aaron snaps.

Both men back toward the door, but neither can tear his eyes away from the
spectacle.  As they watch, the sparks grow in size and frequency.  They arc
over each other, dancing across the machinery.  Minor subsystems crash and
reboot all over Engineering as the sparks jump and dance across vital
circuits.  The wind is now strong enough to buffet them backwards.

As the sparking reaches a crescendo, sparks begin to leap across the
center of the room toward one another.  A jump is made.  Then another,
and another.  Soon, ALL of the sparks are leaping into the center of the
room, forming a network of lines converging on a single point, which glows
blue in the dim room.  The sparks gain in intensity and power, and the wind
rises to a howling tornado, blowing both men back against the consoles,
covering their eyes against the glare.

"WHAT IS IT?" Slide has to yell over the wind.

"I DON\'T KNOW," Aaron bellows.  "IT LOOKS LIKE--"

The sparks suddenly detach themselves, forming a perfect sphere in the
center of the room, some three meters in diameter.  As Slide and Aaron
watch in utter disbelief, the sparks disconnect themselves from the
center point as it expands, forming a hollow sphere of howling wind
and lambent purple flame.

"--LIKE A JUMP-OUT!"


 ==== Aurora ===

Only Moira is left to witness the abrupt transition of the ship, and
she makes no comment, intent on logging data on the phenomenon against
a future time when she may again carry those who would examine it.


 ==== Alcyon ===

In rapid succession, a small army of gates marshall around the Alcyon,
winking into existance like eyes opening in space.   As they vanish
they leave smaller ships in their wake.  Westwind, Kingfisher, Talisman,
Gemini Arbiter, Aurora, the Trakh and its shuttle, even the wreck of
the Bernoulli are left in a loose cluster around the Alcyon, like moths
near a flame.  Even a small, five-meter long cylinder, one end of which
is badly scorched and deformed, floats among them.

In Engineering, both Slide and Aaron are transfixed by the sight before
them-- a glowing sphere of crackling energy where a moment before there
had been nothing.  A Jump-out.

"INSIDE ANOTHER GRID?!" Slide screams. "THAT\'S IMPOSS--"

Then, with a sudden wrench in their guts, Slide and Aaron feel the
Alcyon heave under their feet.  The light and sound are extinguished in
an instant, and for one brief moment, in the sudden dark silence, they
see the impossible: a man in a uniform of some kind, standing on what
looks like it was once a solid stone floor but was scooped out with a
giant, curved knife.  One hand is clutching his face, and the other is
resting against a section of wall, also scooped into a curved surface.
Exposed, sheared-off sections of pipe and cable are visible behind the
wall-- one jets out a puff of steam, another a dribble of water,
another gives off a feeble spark.  It\'s as if a spherical section of a
stone corridor were removed by some invisible hand, and then placed in
mid-air....

...and then gravity takes over, and the entire deck rings with the
clang as both pieces of stone fall to the deck and shatter into
rubble.  The man crumples atop what used to be the piece of floor,
managing to at least stay on his knees.  He lunges unsteadily to
his feet.

Pulling a 9mm out of its holster with lightning speed, he heels to the
right, dropping to a crouch, and yells out, "You are in a restricted
area, scum!" He then peels off three rounds into a part of the jump
drive, which ricochete wildly off into the engineering spaces.

A confused looks appears on his face, as if he were seeing his
surroundings for the first time.  Before he can do anything else,
however, he falls to the floor unconscious, the weapon still nestled
tightly in his grip, with the safety off.

The echoes of the crash and gunfire reverberate throughout the Alcyon.
And then there is silence.


 === All Ships ===

Once again, the voice that greeted the visitors upon their arrival
speaks, but without the ease and authority it previously possessed.

*I apologize for the interference.  It is not my way, but I must protect
myself and I cannot spare the energy to protect all of you as well.
I hope we will have the opportunity to meet again, once this situation
is resolved.  Farewell.*

The voice ceases abruptly.

Then the stars all vanish, leaving only a featureless gray sky.


 === R-Alpha ===

Ayrlathi swings open the wide wooden shutters atop the arzeth danunduln
and looks out.  It is sunfade -- Ayrlathi\'s favourite time of day.  At
least it used to be, when he had a favourite time of day.  An irridescent
hipsir flits through the sky in front of him, trilling its roosting song.
Ayrlathi ignores it.

In past times he would have looked out over the fields of taspeln, or
down onto the town below.  But now he can only look up into the sky.
His tendrils lay flat down on his head, motionless save for an occasional
wistful twitch.

Ayrlathi whispers, so quietly that it is barely audible above the gentle
summer breeze, and yet it is a whisper that -- in spirit at least --
carries far up into the evening twilight.

"Come back soon."

Almost as if in answer to his whisper, there is a knock on the door.

Dejectedly, Ayrlathi turns from the silent stars above and opens
the door. His eyes go wide and his tendrils stand straight up in
utter shock. The voice in his head is friendly and full of welcome.

*Uh, hi! I\'m Ian, and this is Richard, and this is Ferdy. We were told
by the Ring that we would find a friendly welcome here....?*

Terms of Service : At the end of the first year, a character must begin serving a series of four - year terms . The first term is
shortened to three years to compensate for the first year of apprenticeship .

Areas Of Work : At the beginning of each term a character determines the area of his work by rolling a 1d6 . The three possible
areas are : Offworld (1-3), or Onworld (4-6) . Offworld represents work involving space travel, while Onworld indicates the term
will be spent of the planets surface . The prison assignment represents the characters arrest and detention for previous crimes
committed . A character can only go to prison if he rolls equal to his survival roll (see below) .

Assignments : For each year of a four-year term, a character rolls on the Annual Assignments Table corresponding to hisarea of
work. After determining the assignment, a character must roll on the appropriate Assignment Resolution Table for survival,
promotion, connections, and skills. Special, Infiltration, and Job Education assignments do not require the unusual assignment
resolution, and are fully described at the end of the article .

[material deleted]

So lead-acid gives us 1 MJ for 8.6kg, and NiCad needs only 3.3kg, roughly.
I calculated that the current sodium-sulfur (NaS) battery gives 1 MJ for
2.2 kg and the metal alloy hydride needs around 1.7 kg.  These numbers are
rough since the given stats were not precise.

>  So you see that to get 1MWh, rechargable, we\'d need 30 tons of car batteries

Assuming it is merely 12-volt lead-acid scaled, I get closer to 31 T.

The NaS 1MWh weighs around 7.8 T, and metal hydride of the same capacity
weighs a mere 6.1 T.  These new batteries have energy densities about 4 and 5
times that of lead-acid respectively.  Where does that put us on the NASA
projected tech chart?

Here\'s an odd sort of question for you all:  According to the books, a
densiometer can not read into an artificial grav field.  But what about inside
one?  Could someone using a densiometer while inside a ship be able to get any
useful readings?  I would imagine that it would work because the local grav
field around the densiometer would be similar to that of a densiometer sitting
on the surface of a planet.

The fringe effects of trying to look into the field would vanish once you are
physically inside it.  It would sort of be like examining a lead lined fish
tank:  From the outside, you can\'t see in because of the lead.  But from the
inside you should be able to see ok.  Admittedly, the water would effect your
vision, but you could still see.

I\'m just trying to figure out what The robot\'s sensors can tell Tweel about
the inside of the Alcyon.

New Career Branch - Imperial Intelligence .

Each branch of the armed forces has its own intelligence branch . The
premier one being imperial naval intelligence, however the marines
and the army both maintain their own small intelligence services .


The intelligence branch can be selected only by graduates of college /
academy with honours . After that, only by attending intelligence
school, then transfering at the begining of the next term is it possible
to join . With the IISS, those that attend intelligence school can attend
(transfering at the begining of the next term) .

With the imperial naval intelligence branch note that the enlisted
members of the intelligence service are usually computer techs from the
technical branch, that is the intelligence uses them (& their reports) .
Note an intelligence branch member could cross train with the imperial
marine commandos (If in imperial/reserve navy), but would not be able to
use that cross train to transfer to the commandos or marines .


Army / Marines use the same assignment/command resolution tables
as the support branch . Save that a skill roll can be recieved during internal
 security on a roll of 5+ .

The navy use the same assignment/command resolution tables as the
Flight branch, save that a skill can be gained during shore duty on a
 roll of 7+ .

In the case of the military services, they deal mainly with internal
intelligence or military intelligence . The Imperial Ministry of Justice
deals with the more criminal elements of imperial society . Please feel
free to make up your own version of that (And send me a copy) .

The merchant services sometimes maintain their own intelligence
agencies, but generally only sector - wide / megacorps do . The
intelligence branch can only be accepted by those that graduate with
honours from college or the academy . In the case of special duty, if a
modified roll of 8 is rolled on the officers special assignments table,
the merchant goes to intelligence school (as per mercenary guidlines)
the transfered .

First "wearable" computer, maybe.  (I\'ve been carrying a Psion Organiser
in a belt-pouch for years now, but you can\'t use it and "wear" it at the
same time.)

But this is certainly not the first hand-computer.  Sharp had something
answering that description a long time ago; Psion have produced the
Organiser, and more recently the Series 3; and there is the HP95.  If
Marc Miller wants to sue someone, he\'s got quite a long list of possible
targets!

SUMMARY: This document will discuss how the naval combat rules could be
in the revised Traveller rules. It takes in consideration of what I
feel have to be changed by the rules in general. I have thus included
some of my suggestions that I had for the present Traveller rules. This
document also touches a few other topics as well. I have included
revised excerpts of letters I have sent to Clay Bush.

INTRODUCTION.
     One of my most burning interests in Traveller is starships and
starship combats. One of the reasons for this I have the rush of navy
romantics flowing in my bloodstream. Many of my relatives have been
either Navy or merchant captains or crew. I myself have been in the
navy for about 15 months as a sensor operator. Why I\'m not in the navy
now is by medical reasons. But now I\'m loosing the track.

     There is a few things I always wanted to change by the starship
combat in Traveller. Heck... There is a lot of things I wanted to
change. Those who have been informed through Clay Bush or read
documents 142.02 and 142.03 know that I have used heavy ammunition
against the rules as they are.

     My main purpose was to simplify much as possible. But also to
make the rules more realistic. Below I have listed those items that I
attacked most energetic.

     - Hit procedures
     - Penetration procedures
     - Damage procedures
     - Sensors
     - Scales
     - Movement
     - Firing arcs


RULES IN GENERAL.
     One thing I wanted to simplify was the Hit procedure. Calculating
the DM\'s in the way it was done it was difficult to keep track of more
that a few crafts per side. Not only that but you had to roll once for
each battery which fired. This got soon boring when you played with
cruisers with more than 20 batteries. Or battleships with several
hundred.

***********************************************************************
     19 August, 1991
     The hit task can be changed like this. If we presume that the max
effective combat range for starships will be somewhat more than 3000Km,
if you use passive sensors, each hex could be 15Km across. Thus there
should be possible to use the Fire controlled hit task on page 72 in
Players manual.

So the task could look like this:
[difficulty], Off=comp mod, Def=Agility, SizeDM, confrontation
Beam lasers should get a +1 on the hit task, due to their greater
precision over pulse lasers.
***********************************************************************

     For those of you who reacts on the effective combat range for
starships read the section about sensors.

     As you see above the hit task becomes much easier and faster to
use. No need to look up in tables to find DM\'s Dropping the weapon DM
and defensive computer DM simplifies the calculation greatly and speeds
it up. To this rule I have not worked out any One-Roll-For-Many-Batteries
rule but it was just around the corner when the news about revision came.


     Penetration procedures was neither popular with me. As above too
many DM\'s and other strange factors. And rolling once for each battery.
(sigh)  I worked out a few rules for this, but lacked any good ideas
for penetration of screens and configuration.

***********************************************************************
     16 September, 1991
     But before the hit task is rolled the attacker declares his attacks
against a target. Then the target must find out how much of the defensive
system he or she got to bring to bear against the attack. Most shots which
are directed at a target will be close enough to fool the defender to use
defensive measures against shots that will actually miss.

To defend against an incoming shot.
Difficult, Difference in UCP value of weapons, Comp/3, instant
Referee: this task is only rolled for weapons that are going to penetrate
defenses like beams, sandcasters and repulsors. Computer may be substituted
with gunnery skill. Pulse laser got +2 penetration.

Example: The offender shoots with a pulse laser battery with UCP value 6.
The defender uses a sandcaster with factor 7. His ship computer is a model 6.
This gives a DM of +2 (7+(6/3)-6-2).
When all the defensive batteries have tried to stop the incoming fire the
attacker rolls the hit tasks for the shots that did not get stopped.
***********************************************************************

     As you see the simple task above reduces the labor for checking tables
and calculating DM\'s with factors that have nothing in the task to do. Then I
think of the Computer model in the offenders parts of the task listed in
Refs manual. The computer have no influence of how the defence administer
the defensive measures. Thus that part is removed. To equalize the factors a
bit I decided to divide the defenders model number on 3. This reflects the
difficulty to stop incoming fire. At least when the incoming is moving at
the speed of light.

     Damage procedures are maybe the subject I have attacked most fiercly
(with exception of sensors.) I felt it was tedious to roll 20 times for a
spinal mount. Say if you hit with a meson gun you had to roll on 2 tables.
Internal and  radiation damage. 20 times on each is too much labor. And then
there is critical hits. Maybe 30 to 50 rolls just to find out that your ship
is blown into stardust. That\'s several minutes wasted just there.

     Then there is UCP-1 laser that can give Man-1 in damage on any ship size
if it does not have any armor above 40. This is just too much. One other
thing is that fighters can\'t hurt battleships. I don\'t want 1 fighter able to
kill one BB neither 10 or 100, but maybe 300 or 400 will do the job. Here I
would like to compare with Leviathan from FASA. An excellent game. Here a
large force of fighters can defeat a BB of largest type. It all depends on
tactics and what kind of fighters you choose.

***********************************************************************
     16 September, 1991
     I think we should use the damage and penetration factor given Players\'
manual on the starship weapons. This makes us able to use the damage numbers
calculated in the design process. To find the damage of an battery of lasers,
use the damage number in players and multiply with the UCP value and divide
on 10.

Example: An UCP 6 battery of beam lasers-8 have 300 damage points.

     I thought it was appropriate to divide on 10 when vehicle hitpoints have
to be multiplied with 10 in combat. It is easier to divide the damage points
on the weapons with 10, than remembering that the starship can take 10 times
more damage that listed in the UCP form. Thus the weapons aren\'t doing too
much damage so the fun goes out of the game after a few rounds. Higher armor
points should also give more protection against damage than lower armor
points.

     By using the damage points listed in the players\' manual we will se more
lowtech fighters being designed. At TL\'s below 13 fighters have no real punch
due to the limit on the powerplant. They must choose between punch or agility.
Now they can get something in between. The fighters at TL 12 and less can use
other types of energy weapons in space rather than the standard weapons. For
instance the vehicle weapons listed on page 78 in Referee\'s manual can be
used. (Except for the MD that is.)

     Penetration of screens and configuration should be done with percentile
dice. Active blackglobes will absorb a 10 percent of the damage points per
flicker rate. Sinks can store 210 hitpoints per Kl. The jumpdrive can store
((ship volume*jump*.005)/11) hitpoints.
***********************************************************************

     As you see above the amount of damage can be determined more easily.
However the backdrop is that you have to calculate the damage number for the
batteries before the games begins. This can be solved by entering them on the
UCP form at when it is set up.

     For mesonguns I want to include a instant kill or cripple table. This
table gives the effect of the weapon on the target depending on its size.

     Internal hits would be viewed as criticals when the integrity of the
hull is broken nasty things tend to happen. Just ask any astronaut in NASA.

     As an ex-sensor operator I always felt that the sensor rules in
Traveller was wrong. One thing I reacted on was that there is more difficult
to detect an object with an active sensor tuned to Very Distant range than
one with Far Orbit range. Why should it be more difficult to find an object
within the range of the lesser sensor than the greater one. If the object
was outside of the range it would not have shown up at all!

     From my experiences objects with small radar cross sections tended to
disappear when I increased the range settings on the radars I have used.

     Now to the reason why I mentioned that the effective combat range with
starships would be about 3000Km maybe a bit longer.

     In the era of starship combat where all the objects move with speeds up
to several 1000km/s you will need good updating. Now we will have to move
into radar and general sensor theory. First of all a radar or Ladar beam
moves with the speed of light. The radars and ladars operates with something
called Pulse Repetition Frequency or PRF for short. This is how many pulses
per second. The higher the PRF the closer the effective range of the sensor,
but also better is the fire solution. The PRF of a radar that are going to
conduct a 360 degree search cannot have PRF less than 200. At this rate the
radar beam will just cover the full 360 degrees if it is at max tightness.
One thing that must be understood that PRF is equal wavelength or frequency.
Normal radar cannot have beams narrower than 2 degrees. Microwave radars can
have beams that are less than one degree, but their range are very limited.
Point defense and close AAW warfare are their field.

     Of the sensor mentioned above with a PRF of 200 it takes one full minute
to rotate the antenna 360 degrees. For search radar this is great, but for
weapon control it is too slow, far too slow. Not only that but because of
the relatively wide beam the target will be quite large at this PRF. Thus
lasers and other direct firing weapons will have a hard time to hit the
target because it appears larger than what it actually is. High PRF radar
such as those found in weapon guidance systems are better due to their rapid
pulse rate they can get better solution.  Maximum effective range of Radars
on current PRF setting.
     Range in KM=(300,000/PRF)/2

     As you see the PRF is divided on the speed of light. It is further
divided on 2 when the beam are going back and forth.

***********************************************************************
     Here is an exerpt from a letter to Clay 27 September, 1991.
     Weapon fire at 500,000Km I have done some calculations regarding laser
fire at target at 500,000Km. If we assume the target to move 6 hex a round,
he actually moves 125Km/s. When a pulse bounces back from the target, we know
where it was 1.66 seconds ago (the time light uses on 500,000Km.) When we
fires at this contact we must know where it is going to be 3.32 seconds in
advance. And on this time it has moved 415Km. Here we must pin down a ship
that is only a fraction large as the distance moved, and which maybe have
changed course too. If the gunner and/or computer is not psionic this is
impossible, unless the the target is not moving at all.

     With radar I would not fire at a target at longer range than 750Km.
With Ladar I could stretch out to 3000Km maybe longer. This is due to that
the laser gives better fire resolution on the target, but it is dependent on
a radar to find the target. This is due to the narrow beam of the laser. The
ladar must also have a fairly high PRF. No less than 30 or 40. There could
be used continuous wave ladar, but I don\'t think that will help. If the ladar
first miss the target it may need to use many shots/pulses to regain the
track. As a backup for this occurrence I would use a Radar, which can steer
the ladar back on target in the case of a miss.

     Scales in Traveller have been too large. They work against the realism
in more than one way. Firstly 20 minutes a combat turn. Not much time
actually, until you go through a 20 turn combat. That\'s almost 7 hours
constant fighting. I wonder how the concentration level of those guys are
after just two hours. My experiences is that after 30 minutes you are
exhausted. The reason to this is that you work at high pressure from the
fighting starts to it ends. The phase is fast. A few seconds doubt and you
are dead. There is no time to ponder over information. You must either use
it when you get or disregard it. 7 hours at this reckless phase I wouldn\'t
give much for the crews concentration.

     An ideal turn length is about 1 to 3 minutes. This will also reduce
the distance moved which is ideal for the sensor arguments I have above.

     The large scale also prevented any good tactics. The combats is only
large slugfests. What I like about tactical games is the possibility of
outmaneuvering the opponent. In Traveller this is not possible when the
maneuver drive only tells who can run away from whom. The agility only makes
you harder to hit.

     This merges with the firing arcs. The arcs that exists are too limited.
Or rather too extensive. Read the excerpt below then I will continue this
line of thought.

***********************************************************************
     Movement could be plotted on graph paper. 1cm equals 15Km or something
like that. Thus there is possible to control where the spinal mount aims.
This will have some significance when there is differences between grav
drives and thruster drives.

     Thruster drives cannot aim at a target which deviates more than 5
degrees from the course, else the maneuver capability will be impaired.

     Different ships will then also move differently on the board, which
makes it more realistic. Here is my suggestions:
     Base rate of turning equals (agility*10) + 300
     Large ships are modified with  -200
     Medium ships are modified with   00
     Small ships are modified with  +200

     Thus dreadnoughts with low agility will find it difficult to escape the
meson spinal mount of a high agility ship if first caught.
***********************************************************************

      As you see now it becomes more vital where you aim your ship. No one
wants to be caught in the arc of a meson spinalmount. Lighters ship will
find it easier to outmaneuver the largest ones, but they will have the
largest weapons. It equals out somehow.



DESIGN AND OTHER RELATED TOPICS.
     Now that Traveller are going to be revised, there have been some (or a
lot of) thinking about what the new starships will be. Are we going to see
the old familiar format or is the rules for designing starships going to be
changed completely.

     There is some concepts in the current design rules that may need
changing, but those are minor in my opinion. Some have been attacking the
powerplant output figures. I don\'t know if those figures are right, but then
I have no physics training either. Over the last two years we have seen that
booster plants have been increasingly popular. Thus battleships have been
able to muster high agility.

     Other items have been armor facings and firing arcs. Both these two
items can be included in the current design process without much trouble.
Scott Olson mailed me a document on how to calculate the armor factors on
the different sides. For those who want this document can either contact me
or him. The advantage with armor facings will be of tactical matter. If your
Left side armor is badly beaten it would be wise to expose the Right side. I
feel that this will enhance the game.

     Firing arcs can be handled the same way. Different configurations will
have different amounts of weapons on each side. A sphere will have almost
equal number of each battery on each its four sides. (Front, Aft, Left and
Right.) A needle or wedge configuration will have maybe 80% of the batteries
divided evenly on Left and Right. The remainder 20% is Front and Aft. This
can be included in the UCP form. However this will make the listing longer.

     One thing that a lot of people will change is the maneuver drive. This
drive is rated in maneuver gee related to size not weight. Some feel this is
wrong. Basically it is, but if you look at Leviathan from FASA all the
different ship classes is stuck with a fixed maneuver gee. no matter how
much they weigh. You may double the maneuver gee by not firing any weapons.
The maneuver gee may be increased by one point in the design process, but at
the cost of available power to the weapons. So the way used in Traveller just
simplifies the matter.


     The biggest sentiment against the design rules is that you have to use
a spreadsheet the get the designs right. I have tried using a calculator with
very little success, even with small design of just a few hundred tons. But I
don\'t think this argument is good enough to eleminate the design rules. If
you ask me you won\'t find any better rules for designing starships anywhere.
FASA\'s Leviathan starships are too generic. The Traveller rules gives better
variation both due to its TL system and larger variation of weapons and
sensors. A few other things could have been included such as magnets used by
space tugs and ramscopes used by those who have not managed to invent the
jumpdrive, even if they are at higher TL\'s.

     I think it would be a loss to see the current design rules disappear.
When I think of the Wet Navy rules and COACC I also think of all those hours
wasted. It\'s just too bad that so good rules are going to disappear.


FUTURE OF THE NAVIES.
     Now that the Imperium is really shattered the Imperial Navy as we know
it is dead. For those few areas that have been able hold on to some
technology large fleets have proven to bee too expensive. (Read Hard Times.)
Those few capital ships that survived the battles have either been scrapped
or put into mothball for future use when the times are better.

     General starship travel is also decreasing. And if this virus idea
becomes real starships won\'t be popular guests at systems that cannot
protect themselves from this thing. From what I have heard this virus is more
bacteriologic than logical. It eats the wafers. There is possible to protect
computers from this thing, but if it does not find the type of food it needs,
it may decide that some other material is equally edible. So it may come back
when believed extinct one place, just like the flue or common cold.

     If this virus get the chance of running rampant known space of the
Traveller universe won\'t be safe. Imperial or other places. Starships will
be the most likely infector of other worlds. The wafers are in most computer
controlled gadgets. Thus not only will the PC conk out, but the car, stove,
washer, stereo, TV and so on will conk out too. If someone on an infected
takes with him a pocket computer, he may also take with him the virus or
bacteria. However the loss of data may be limited. Storage medias like tapes,
disks crystals and other types would likely be safe, so the data stored here
can be accessed by alternate systems.

     Navy ships will neither be safe from this thing. Those few ships that
still exists have to take on pirate control in the surrounding area where it
is based. These pirate ships may be infected. If worst comes to worst we will
have the feeling of the long night revisited in the stone age.

     I hope and I don\'t think the situation will be so grim, much damage
will be done, but how much is in the hands of GDW.

     Clay Bush had one interesting project going. And that was Imperial Navy
Handbook (INH). Now that the Imperial navy is just a distant memory this
project may be dead, or is it.... Even when the Imperial navy is gone there
is still many navies around both small and large. The small and relative safe
areas in the former Imperium still have some fragments left. All the capital
ships are probably gone, but smaller squadrons will exist. And then we have
those other navies as Solomani and Aslan and a host of other political
powerblocks that have not gone through destructive wars. The project are
after my view still valid, the emphasis have changed a bit, but that\'s all.
So if you are interested in this project Clay need your support now!!


FUTURE STARSHIP COMBAT.
     What the really new starship combat rules will look like is beyond me,
but I see two main possibilities. One is that new rules are made around the
existing starship design rules. The other will be new rules to the new
starships. What\'s important is that we don\'t get a generic way of the combat.
Remember that it is the crew not the equipment that fight the wars. Better
equipment just gives an edge nothing more.

     If 2 starships was going to fight each other they would have equal
chance to win if they had the same ship and equally skilled crew. But if one
ship is more advanced than the other the crew with the more advanced will
have better chance. We do also have the case where the better ship got poorer
trained crew than the lesser ship. This will in some cases equal out. Here is
one suggestion I had for Traveller to handle crew quality.

     The skill levels for the different crew qualities could be divided like
this:
     Quality            Navy      SDB       Paramilitary    Civil
     ----
     Recruit - 1         3         3             3           3-5
     Regular - 2        4-8       4-9           4-10         6-11
     Veteran - 3        9-13     10-14         11-12        12-16
     Crack   - 4       14-16     15-17         13-17         17+
     Elite   - 5+       17+       18            18            -

     Thus this will give the better trained and experienced crew more edge.
There is no use in the computer if the crew is poorly trained. Even if the
computer is more advanced than the opposition computer.

     This will change the hit task rule I mentioned above. Divide the
computer model number on 2 and drop fractions. Skills as ship and fleet
tactics are used as before.

     If we suppose the current rules for starship design sticks the rules
may look like the suggestions below. For those of you who don\'t have T:2000
rules should get them. Either buy them or do as me lend them from a friend.

To hit a starship with starship weapons:
Average, (SKill+Computermod/2)-(Agility+sizeDM)

To prevent incoming fire to hit.
Difficult, (Skill+DefUCPfact+computermod/3)-Offensive UCP factor
Note:This cannot be used on screens and configuration

To detect a starship on sensor
Easy, Sensor ops

To pinpoint a starship.
Average, Sensor ops

     Increase level if offender uses jamming. This is a crude sensor rule,
but here I assume that Radar or Active EMS is used which isn\'t hard to use at
all. When I know more about the rules to Revised Traveller I will make some
better sensor rules.

     For damage use the calculations I mentioned above. If a weapon has
penetration enough to go through the armor give half the hits to hull. There
is no rolls for radiation, when those are included in the damage points.
However if a ship is hit by nukes, reduce damage to fiber optic computers
with 25%. Whenever a hit penetrates armor apply 10% of the hits to crew when
those do not have a hit location on the table. To find out how much pounding
the crew can take before they are dead take the max hitpoint the crew can
take before they dies and multiply with crew number.

Example: If we assume the average hitpoints on the crew is 30 which is the
chest hit capacity and multiply that with the crew number of 200 we get 600
points. When 2 thirds of the hitpoints are taken the ship is unable to fight.
To resolve meson attacks. Mesongun bays do 1000 hitpoints per UCP factor.
Spinal mounts that with the old rules could roll more than 10 times on the
hit location table automatically cripples the target, which then becomes
unable to fight. If the mesongun could roll more than 15 time the ship is
dead, vaporized, disassembled, fini, gone, you get the picture. If a
mesongun (Spinal or bay) would have rolled more than 3 times on the critical
hit table the ship is crippled. If it could roll more than 6 times it is
destroyed. A ship may endure three cripple hits before it is destroyed.

     Hit location tables
     Exterior             Interior
     ----
     1 Maneuver             Jump
     2 Weapon               Computer
     3 Sensor               Powerplant
     4 Sensor               Fuel leak
     5 Weapon               Computer
     6 Maneuver             Jump

Exterior features are not protected by armor. Sensors, weapons and computer
can take 100 hits before they are reduced with one battery or UCP factor.
For meson bays roll once for each UCP and divide the hitpoints evenly on the
locations. Whenever Jumpdrive is hit give half of the jumpdrive hits to the
hull, due to that the lanthanum grid is situated there. Do give one third of
the rolls to exterior table.

     These rules are rather crude, but then I have just thought them up at
the spur of the moment. Some of them I have been pondering on for a while,
but not really tested.

     If we are going to see new design rules there is a few points that I
would like to see in both design and combat rules. And those are:
 - Easier damage system

 - More logical damage system (Crafts with weapons UCP values below A never
   score an internal hit, but may score a critical hit.)

 - Well defined repair rules (What is the damage status of a ship that have
   lost its maneuver drive?)

 - Internal hits can be viewed as crits, when internal hits will be nasty no
   matter what weapons scored the hit.

 - Smaller scale for time and movement. ("Captain, the pilot have collapsed
   after 4 hours of constant combat.")

 - Faster task resolution for hit and penetration. Having a constant DM of 11
   going over dozen different weapon factors sounds bad in my ears.

 - Easy to use and generic damage record form that can be used by all types
   of craft. If necessary make few different forms as possible, when size and
   purpose of a craft can look totally different on the damage record form.

 - Simultaneous movement and fire. Something like FASA\'s Interceptor and
   Leviathan would be nice.

 - Possibility to integrate the rules with personal and vehicle combat.

 - If the rules are to be released in a separate book, I suggest that all the
   design rules are put into it. (COACC, Wet Navy, Vehicles and Robots.) This
   will reduce the time we have to wait until all the sections are ready and
   tested up to each other. The set should also be boxed so that in can
   include counters and game boards. Plastic miniatures for COACC, Wet NAvy
   and Starships would be fine, but not important.


STARSHIP OPERATOR\'S MANUAL.
     As the rules are to be revised, this fine book will hopefully not be
outdated. If the technology in Traveller as we know it doesn\'t change it
would still be valid with the new rules. However the task rules at the end
of the book have to be rewritten. If DGP will do this is unknown when they
are going to spend considerably time to support their product AI.

     If DGP won\'t do it hopefully GDW will. Those rules aren\'t essential,
but I feel that they should be included when they would be fine to have when
the extra detail are needed.


THE OTHER STUFF THROWN IN.
     I do have some worries about the future of Traveller. Some may say it
is too early to worry, but that doesn\'t help much. I have read the T:2000
and Dark Conspiracy rules and I found that I don\'t like them. The main
reason to this is that the task system seems weak. Hell... I think it is
weak. The difficulty scaling is just wild. In my view a person who have any
training in a given field should have at least 60% chance to make a routine
task in that fieldon first try. In T:2000 this ain\'t possible. If you have a
skill level of 1 you have 10% chance to make it. If the task is made easy it
raises to the incredible 20% chance.

     Other things it does not cover is automatic failure and success. At
least the rules do not mention it. Unskilled tasks are neither mentioned.
Hopefully these things will be included in the new rules to Traveller.

     Hopefully we will se an increased product support for revised Traveller.
And the I hope we won\'t see too many cross-over adventures. Twilight
Nightmares are released, and more of that type may be in the pipeline.
Cross-overs aren\'t bad in their selves, that just the games will loose their
novelty when we will see titles as Twilight 5600, Dark Traveller, Gravs\'n
dinosaurs and so on.

     My final worry is the published alien modules from DGP. Those products
can be wasted money if GDW do not include guidelines on how to generate
characters from these races, and how to use the interaction rules. Or else
they have to be reprinted in the new format.


FAMEOUS LAST WORDS.
     If you have anythink to comment on in this document feel free to write
to me. Any input is good input. Note that I have had little time to actually
test the rules suggestions properly.

			- XVII -
	It was late morning when Dr. Malenkoviepr got back to the
ship.  It had been a hard morning:  first explaining to the
marine commander that no his ship was not going to blow up at
any moment, and no it was not a danger to his men, and second...
Well... perhaps he didn\'t like saying good bye to Dr. Lorain
Messandi.
	"All right, everything is ready, all that remains is to get
the weapons into the dome." said Malenkoviepr tiredly, "Any ideas
on how to do that?"
	"Security seems a little tight to try smuggling it in."
sighed Shtam.  "I would rather just try to sneak into the dome."
	"I never did like the idea of going there unarmed that way."
agreed Niedrsha.
	"Yes," agreed Jietlshaiepr, "We would have to subdue at
least two marines in battle dress without alerting the rest of
them.  That\'s a bit much to ask."
	"Ok, we can sneak in and ambush the guards when the bombing
starts." interjected Miakr excitedly.
	"All right, this is how we do it." began Malenkoviepr, "I\'ll
scan the place with life detection to see where the area is
clear.  Then, Jietlshaiepr will teleport in with the PGMP to
supply covering fire while we get in, if we need it.  If we open
up prematurely, we will have an entire platoon of marines
breathing down our necks.  We fly in through the windows in
groups, and with luck, take them by surprise.  We move out at
0640."
			- XVIII -
	Jietlshaiepr leaned over her patient, still nothing.  Yet
the instruments read perfect perfect health.  Still, no
measurable brain activity.  "Dr. Malenkoviepr?"
	"Yes?"
	"Can you read anything in Drert\'s mind?"
	Darkness...  Dark...  Darker...  Darkest...  Silence...
Down, down, down...  The fist, still closed...  Massive...  The
fist:  larger than it was...  Clenched tight...  But...  It is
opening...  slowly...
			- XIX -
	"All right, we are a hundred meters from the dome.  Shtam,
you and Niedrsha stay together, Once Jietlshaiepr teleports
inside you two will be the first to follow.  I go next.  Miakr,
you and Vole will follow once we are inside. If any one of us is
spotted we will all go for the dome.  We will have to hold it
till Oddball gets here with his cavalry.  0640.  Let\'s get
moving.  Make sure you stay under cover."
	They moved out to the sand mounds surrounding the dome for
cover.  The early morning was quiet, the little wild life of the
desert having already settled back into their holes.
	A few marines were scattered around their camp in the full
spectrum of alertness.  Some sunning themselves, some in full
battle dress.
	Malenkoviepr closed his eyes, "Two marines, five meters from
the entrance.  About ten to twelve out in the surrounding area.
They seem to be on patrol.  Jietlshaiepr, you ready?"
	"All set."
	"Niedrsha?  Shtam?" queried the doctor.
	"Right."
	"Check."
	"Miakr?  Vole?"
	"We\'re set."
	"Ok, Jietlshaiepr, 0653.  Go!"
	Jietlshaiepr vanished.
	A moment later her scrambled radio sounded.  "All clear."
	Shtam and Niedrsha flitted out.  They skimmed over the
surface as low as they could from sand mound to sand mound.
Finally the two reached the base of the dome and swooped up and
into the window.
	"We\'re inside."
	Dr. Malenkoviepr flew flat out over the broken terrain.
Three mounds of sand provided cover.  Stay low.
	Suddenly he caught sight of figure out in the dunes and
dropped to the ground.  Did he see me?  Blast.
	Slowly Malenkoviepr rose looking for the man he\'d seen.
Just peek over the top of this mound.  A marine, looking the
other way.  Good.  Stay that way.
	He dropped lower and was off again.  He came to the base of
the dome and rose slowly again looking for the marine.  Can\'t see
him anywhere.  He flew into the dome.
	"All right Miakr, come on, and watch out there was a marine
out in the dunes ninety meters to the right. It is 0655."
	They went up first scanning with all the sensors they had.
The marine was gone.  They flew over hard and fast and reached
the base of the dome.  Again they rose, scanning the landscape.
	Gauss needles glanced off Vole\'s armor and slammed into the
side of the dome.
	Vole and Miakr turned instantly on the firing marine and
opened up simultaneously.  Gauss needles tore through metal
knocking the figure over in a tumbling heap that rolled down the
side of the dune.
	They turned and swooped through the window.
			- XX -
	The giant fist opened like a flower.
			- XXI -
	"You idiot!" Jietlshaiepr leveled her plasma gun at the
door.  Footsteps were coming fast:  metal footsteps.  The
sentries peered in through the door into the blackness adjusting
their IR gear.
	Suddenly one was blinded while the other ceased to exist.  A
plasma bolt ripped through his chest section ripping him in half.
The other marine jerked and tripped as Niedrsha introduced him to
a gauss needle.  His dying act was to grab his shredded crotch.
	"Miakr, take Vole and cover those windows!" shouted Shtam.
	Malenkoviepr already had that idea and was set up watching
the marine camp.  Five marines coming this way.  "Five more
headed for the door.  Twenty seconds to go."  "Viepchakl!" he
thought, "Two of the marines have fusion guns!"
	Malenkoviepr opened up with the rifle set on full automatic
spraying the group.  One fusion gunner caught it on the shoulder
he spun around and fell unmoving.  The other\'s leg was hit and he
fell to his knees.  The weapon went off in his hands and hit the
ground ahead of him.  The ground exploded and leapt skyward in a
great cloud.
	The smoke cleared and four marines were on the ground.  The
fifth was still running, and the platoon was beginning to swarm
out of the barracks.
	"Take cover!" shouted Shtam.
	Then the world exploded.
	The barracks, the head quarters, and the motor pool with the
parked grav tanks all erupted in sizzling flame as four batteries
of seven hundred and fifty megawatts worth of lasers sliced
through them.
	The shock knocked Malenkoviepr from his perch and he
struggled to regain control with his grav belt.  He came within
centimeters of smashing into the ceiling but swung away in time.
Vole and Miakr were similarly occupied as the dome shook under
the barrage of laser and missile fire.
	Two marines burst through the entrance.  One carried a gauss
pistol, the other carried a plasma gun in her arms.  They were
disoriented from the sound of the barrage that shook the very
foundations of their eardrums.  Both almost completely naked.
	The plasma gunner was hit twice as she squeezed off a shot.
She spun around off balance and crumpled.
	The plasma bolt hit the ground a meter from Shtam.  He was
thrown several meters and landed in a heap.
	The second marine stumbled, fired blind and wild.  Niedrsha
twisted and fired as the shot grazed his shoulder.
			- XXII -
	The giant hand reached out.
			- XXIII -
	A needle went through the marine\'s arm just before a plasma
bolt hit him square in the back.  The body exploded.
	Suddenly, Drert\'s battle dress appeared in the dome.  He
strode up behind Niedrsha and clamped his hands around his
wounded shoulder.
	Niedrsha suddenly felt a tickling sensation in his shoulder
of hilarious proportions.  He jerked and spluttered with mirth.
He started to collapse gasping for breath as Drert\'s touch
tickled him to helplessness.
	Jietlshaiepr looked on unbelievingly at the incongruously
bizarre scene.  But only for a moment when she realized Shtam
wasn\'t moving.  Shtam\'s leg looked bad.  The blast had cracked
the seals of his right leg piece.  The exposed flesh had third
degree burns, and large sections of the calf muscles had been
inexpertly and roughly removed exposing the tibia and shattering
the fibula.  She was in for a tough job later, but even
amputations could be regenerated.  She quickly injected a mixture
of fast drug and no-shock sending Shtam on a long ride up a
purple river under an orange sky.
	When she looked up, Drert was bending down holding out a
glowing blue crystal.  He picked up Shtam in one hand and
vanished.
	Malenkoviepr stood covering the entrance scanning.  Six life
forms coming...  Deafness...  Disorientation...  Panic...  A
psionic scream...  blackness as it became five forms coming.
	He waved over his remaining crew.  Niedrsha walked over
dazedly and knelt with his gauss rifle at the ready.
	Three forms in battle dress burst through the smoke and dust
thinking they had reached cover.  They dived for the floor in the
spider\'s parlor.
	Vole\'s bite is far worse than his bark.  His laser welder
focused on the neck piece of one marine, burning leaving a
smoking hole, while his gauss rifle widened the gap sending the
helmet and it\'s occupant spinning across the floor.
	Malenkoviepr fired into one of the cowering forms.  It
jumped and was still.
	Niedrsha took the third which had fallen at his knees.  The
shot was never felt: a brain has to be there to receive a
message.
	The remaining two:  a fusion gunner and a rifleman, jumped
in witnessing the carnage of their fellows.  They grabbed for
their weapons.
	A plasma bolt from Jietlshaiepr blew the legs out from under
the fusion gunner and out the door.  Miakr\'s gauss needles
smashed his helmet in as he fell where his feet had been.
	Malenkoviepr took the rifleman out with a well aimed blast,
but not before he had fired wildly.
	A stray needle caught Miakr in the abdomen, and he crumpled.
	Jietlshaiepr was on him in a flash.  Clean puncture wound
possible damage to the kidneys but far enough from the spinal
column.
	Miakr began a long, slow trip through a hot pink asteroid
belt.
	Suddenly, the thunder outside stopped.
	Silence... Ears ringing... It\'s over?
	Radio crackle:  "Hey, any youse guys order a pizza?
Oddball\'s delivers!"
	"Sausage and onions for me, Oddball." quipped Malenkoviepr.
	"Hey, hey, hey!  What\'s up Doc?"
	Malenkoviepr scanned for life.  "Looks like there are about
three of them:  Ninety meters north by northeast of the dome."
	"Gotcha!"
	An plasma bolt, explosion... another...
	"I tink dat wraps it up.  Yo Broadsword!  Adder!  All clear!
send down da cutters."
	"What ship is the Adder?"
	"Dat\'s dere\'s:  da battle cruiser."
	The grav tank came to rest outside the dome.  "Hey, ya all
right in dere?"  Oddball bounced over to the entrance and glanced
in at the carnage, "Hey, youse guys don\'t mess around.  Good
work.  Maybe dat shows ya something \'bout yer teacher."
	"Miakr!"  Gresha yelped as she recognized the recumbent form
of the Kliemoshie\'s steward.  She rushed forward.
	"My, my, Gresha, what big teeth you got..." mumbled Miakr
incoherantly.
	"All the better to... Oh, forget it.  He seems to be
allright." managed Gresha haughtily.
 	Jietlshaiepr activated a lock on Miakr\'s battle dress
locking all the joints so he could be transported easily.  "Vole,
take Miakr back to the ship.  Strip him and prepare the place for
surgery.  Gresha, go with them.  I\'ll follow in a moment."
	Vole and Gresha activated Miakr\'s grav belt and flew him
out.
	"All right, Niedrsha let me see that shoulder."
	Oddball turned to Malenkoviepr and guestured to the weapons
dropped by the marines.  "Nice work Doc, but I\'ll warn ya now, if
ya want any of these swell toys, you better hide \'em.  I got
orders to hand over any I find to the Ine Givar.  We got sixteen
minutes."
	"We may need replacement parts for the battle dress."
suggested Niedrsha looking at the hole in his own armor.
	"Viepchakl!  Stop moving, I\'m examining you." growled
Jietlshaiepr.
	"How is he?" wondered Malenkoviepr remembering suddenly.
	"Disgustingly healthy.  Not even a blasted scar to teach the
bastard.  What did I tell you about getting in the way of a
bullet?  You\'re going to pay for this mister!" spat Jietlshaiepr.
"I\'m off.  Grab me a fusion gun if you think of me."  She kissed
Niedrsha and flew off.
	"So, anything interesting around this dump Doc?" asked
Oddball.
	"Not much, but this should be interesting to examine."
Malenkoviepr shot off a piece of the Diamond glass.  "I want a
sample of this stuff though.  It is harder than diamonds but is
workable at high temperatures.  The rest appears to be just
junk."
	"Cool!  cool!"
	Niedrsha grabbed one of the suited marines that wasn\'t to
damaged, strapped a fusion gun onto it and flew off with it.
	"Da Ine Givar are gonna fire a nuke:  Scorched ground
policy."
	"Viepchakl."  "This idiocy is worthy of SORAG." he thought.
	"Hey, some of these marines are naked!"
	"Happened during the bombardment.  Explosion must have blown
their clothes off."
			- XXIV -
	They managed to grab enough equipment from the wreckage to
complete two suits of battle dress and repair their own suits.
Weapons total: one fusion gun, two tech fourteen plasma guns,
four gauss pistols, ammunition for their rifles including several
RAM grenades.
			- XXV -
	"Quite a little haul." commented Oddball appreciatively.
"Too bad about Gresha.  I hate filling out casualty reports.  I\'m
gonna miss her."  He handed Gresha her pack.  "Here\'s your stuff
girlie, keep in touch.  I won\'t be workin\' for those twits
forever.  Take good care of her Doc."
	"Why will you fill out a casualty report?" wondered
Malenkoviepr.
	"How else am I gonna explain how her armor, rifle and fusion
gun disappeared?"
			- XXVI -
	The Adder\'s pinnace landed next to the dome and it\'s crew
swarmed out.  The terrorists were a motley assortment of humans
armed with every thing from sub-machine guns to FGMP-15\'s.
Roland T. Gunner and his psi-shield stepped out and surveyed the
situation.  "Ok, Doctor, what have you got for us?" he asked in
his threatening monotone.
	"One hitherto unknown crystalline compound harder than
diamonds."
	"Interesting.  Any weapons?"
	"None."
	"Well, we\'ll take what we can get.  Men, start stripping the
corpses.  What sort of artifacts?"
	"Nothing, it is a pretty bare site for that sort of thing.
It would appear that the entire base was subjected to an enormous
amount of heat some time after the base was abandoned.  It melted
what was here."
	"Shit!  This operation cost us."
	"Yes, I\'m disappointed to.  But there is nothing here of
value except the structure itself.  Just a bunch of fused and
slagged puddles of metals."
	"What kind of metals?"
	"Aluminum, copper, gold..."
	"Nothing of value?"
	"No, I am afraid we will learn little, but..."
	"Leave that for our science operatives.  I\'m not interested
in what we learn.  How much gold?"
	"What do you mean, you\'re no... Oh, twenty or thirty
kilograms total, it is mixed in with other metals in puddles
inside the dome.  It is probably the remains of computers."
	"Good."
	"What do you mean you are not interested in what we learn?"
	"We\'re fighting a revolution.  Knowledge isn\'t my first
priority, weapons are.  This crystal, can you make armor out of
it?"
	"I doubt it, you would have to synthicize it first, then
there is the problem of the fact that it has a relatively low
melting point.  As protection, you could do better with stuff
more available.  But for special applications it might be
extremely useful, saws, cutting tools, or in this case, windows.
Right now we don\'t know enough about it to start thinking about
applications."
	"Bullet proof windows... I\'ll leave that for the science
operatives.  Where\'s the gold?"
			- XXVII -
	"How\'s the crew Jietlshaiepr?"
	"Well," she began, "Niedrsha is completely healed.  Miakr is
too, but he\'s not quite out of the drugs yet.  Shtam\'s leg had to
come off.  Regeneration should be no problem.  Actually, unless
I\'m mistaken it has already started.  I know he is shielded, and
may know awareness, I never asked.  But, considering the shape he
is in, I would say he is not doing it himself.  I\'ve got him
sedated.  Viepchakl!  If this continues, Drert is going to put me
out of a job.  Inducing regeneration is no mean trick."
	"Agreed." commented Malenkoviepr, "It requires advanced
knowledge of both awareness and telepathy.  And we all saw him
teleport.  What else can he do."
	"Well, when I came in, he was reading."
	"So?"
	"He had the ship\'s library tape running at fast forward.  He
sat there with a completely blank face holding that crystal.  Now
how did he get it."
	"He teleports..."
			- XXVIII -
	Malenkoviepr opened the safe in his stateroom.  Roland had
agreed to one hundred thousand compensation for Shtam\'s and
Miakr\'s wounds.  Two hundred and fifty thousand to be returned.
That stupid guerrilla, he didn\'t even want to learn anything...
Weapons!...  Ha!...  What does he know about science?...  No, if
you can\'t understand it, blow it up!...  What\'s...  that...
smell?...  Tranq!
	In one move he threw the money into the safe and whirled
around.  He stopped but the room continued to spin.
	A man in a filter...  Move it!...
	Malenkoviepr jumped for the door but his feet wouldn\'t
cooperate.  He slipped and crashed to the floor.  He struggled to
get up but his arms wouldn\'t hold him.  The last thing he
remembered someone was taking off his battle dress.
			- XXIX -
	The Adder\'s pinnace lifted off.
	Niedrsha hesitated.  Hold on, the doc was going to give them
some credits back...  Something\'s up.
	He punched the radio circuit in his battle dress, "Dr.
Malenkoviepr, come in... Doc?   Jiet, come in, the doc doesn\'t
answer, something is up."
	"He\'s in his stateroom."
	"Well, check on him will you?"  He waited anxiously.  "Vole,
can you run up the engines I think were going to have to move,
and fast.  They talked about nuking the place."
	"I\'m on it." answered the robot.
	"Niedrsha!" shouted Jietlshaiepr, "The doc\'s been taken.
His room is full of tranq gas and his armor is on the floor."
	"Right.  Jiet, we need Miakr and fast.  Is he coherent?"
	"This is Miakr, I\'m feeling closer to reality, I can see it
from here."
	"Get to the engine room and crank those engines.  We have to
leave five minutes ago."
	"Take off power will be up in four minutes ten seconds."
reported Vole.  "Full power about five minutes after that."
	Niedrsha turned to the ship\'s radio.  "Enoc Spaceport, this
is Kliemoshie, over... We are under attack...  come in..."
	"This is Enoc Spaceport," drawled a voice slowly, "Come in,
repeat, come in..."
	"This is Kliemoshie, we are under attack, repeat we are
under attack... the ancient archeological site is being over run.
we will be lifting off as soon as we have power... in five
minutes thirty seconds... Please give us clearance immediately."
	"Kliemoshie, this is spaceport control, repeat message..."
	"Well," thought Niedrsha, "at least they won\'t blame this
raid on us now."
			- XXX -
	"Ok, everybody hang on."  Niedrsha pushed the throttle up.
The Kliemoshie shook and lifted slowly.  Low power makes for long
lift offs.  Rock crags came up reaching for the fleeing courier.
She swung around them drunkenly.
	"Engine room, keep that power coming."
	"Point nine G\'s and climbing..."
	"We\'ll need more than that."
	It\'s coming... one G and climbing."
	The Kliemoshie limped clear of the surface and into the sky.
Now all we need is altitude and distance.
	Gresha looked up from the scanners.  "That pinnace has twice
our top speed. and a damn good head start:  range two thousand
kilometers."
	"Drert, get in the turret."
	"They\'ve got missiles, and a battle cruiser with nuclear
missiles beyond that."
	"They also have Dr. Malenkoviepr.  Drert, commence fireing."
	The lasers fired.
	The pinnace flew on unhindered or hit.
	"They\'ve fired their missiles."
	Miakr broke in on the intercom, "We have full power."
	"Good boy, Miakr!"
	"Missiles closing... ten seconds to intercept."
	"Hold on to your shorts, folks, here we go!" called
Niedrsha.  The Kliemoshie swung around in a waltzing corkscrew.
She responded slowly.  Creaks and groans ran through her frame as
she scrambled for her life.
	"Three... two... one... zero..."
	Three missiles streaked by and headed toward the surface of
Enoc.
	"Good work Niedrsha." Gresha sighed.  "The Adder is closing
in for rendezvous with the pinnace.  We\'ll be in range of their
guns in five minutes.  Range to pinnace now two thousand five
hundred kilometers.  Range to cruiser fifty five thousand
kilometers.  Rendezvous of pinnace and cruiser eighteen minutes."
	The lasers fired.  The pinnace continued to fly unhurt.
	"They\'ve fired again.  Assuming we disabled her engines now
we couldn\'t intercept it for another nine minutes."
	"Drert, cease fire." ordered Niedrsha, "We can\'t intercept
now without taking on that fucking battle cruiser.  Sorry Doc,
but the battle\'s lost already.  We\'ll getcha back somehow."
	The Kliemoshie turned and ran at full acceleration.

You\'ve got it.  Sorry for the delay:


MegaTraveller

     It  has been several days since someone requested a list  of
all  MT  products, so I figured I might as well take  a  shot  at
answering.  I\'m in a bit of a bad mood today with a headache  and
all, so don\'t take some of these _too_ seriously.

Boxed Set: Player\'s Handbook
           Referee\'s Manual
           Imperial Encyclopedia

     I won\'t bother with a review of these, since I suspect  that
most of you have them.  They\'re a basic compilation of the  char-
acter generation, combat, trade, craft building, task  resolution
and  star system generation systems, plus some background on  the
Third  Imperium  and  it\'s spectacular collapse into  a  mass  of
warring  splinter states.  Why?  We don\'t know since there  isn\'t
really enough information.

From GDW:  Rebellion Sourcebook
           Referee\'s Companion
           Fighting Ships of the Shattered Imperium
           COACC
           Knightfall
           Hard Times
           Various Issues of Challenge

     The  Rebellion Sourcebook adds to the information  found  in
the Imperial Encyclopedia by telling us about fleet organization,
and  giving  us a thumbnail sketch of each of the  major  warring
factions.   In addition there are a few large space combat  vehi-
cles, not especially well designed, and a barebones outline of  a
decent  adventure that would send the characters  halfway  across
the Shattered Imperium in search of some parts for an  experimen-
tal weapon.

     The Referee\'s Companion tries feebly to make up for the lack
of a lot of material in the Referee\'s manual, giving you a  group
of  unrelated articles on such topics as communications,  aliens,
and robots without the necessary rules to use them, and a totally
inadequate  large  scale combat system  ultimately  derived  from
Striker.

     Fighting Ships of the Shattered Imperium is without a  doubt
the  worst Traveller product ever issued by GDW.  It is a  worth-
less collection of Imperial Navy vessels filled with bad designs,
typos,  and  rules violations, and most of the vessels,  even  if
properly  designed  would  be of little or no use  to  a  referee
running a \'typical\' Traveller adventure.

     COACC  is a little better than Fighting Ships in that it  is
mostly  internally self consistent.  It presents a set  of  rules
for use in air combat (fighter on fighter and all that) which  is
usable  over  a very limited range of tech levels,  a  supporting
adventure  outline (fairly stupid) and design systems  for  fixed
wing, rotary wing and lighter than air flying vehicles.  Unfortu-
nately  it is not very compatible with the other design  systems.
Ask Scott Kellogg about the Indianapolis series.

***Spoiler  Warning??*** Knightfall is one of only two  published
adventure  supplements  for MegaTraveller.   Old  time  Traveller
aficionados  will  remember that we sat around waiting  for  many
years  to discover the "Secret of the Ancients".  Well, it  seems
that  the secret was really one layer deeper, since old  Grandfa-
ther raided the relics of an even more Ancient race, here  dubbed
the Primordials for many of his super-science miracles.  We  find
out  in this module that the Primordials eventually all  died  of
boredom.  So will you.

     Hard  Times is effectively a continuation of  the  Rebellion
Sourcebook,  describing the next five years of the rebellion  and
dealing with the immediate aftermath.  Various of the folks  here
have  done an adequate job of describing the flaws and  shortcom-
ings  in this book, so I won\'t repeat them here.  I think  it  is
still  the  best addition to MT to come  from  GDW...which  isn\'t
saying  much.   A design system for  pre-gravitic  spacecraft  is
included, which I think is kind of fun.

     Challenge started out life many years ago as the Journal  of
the  Traveller\'s  Aid Society, and it has evolved  to  the  point
today  where very little MegaTraveller material sees print.   I\'m
still  buying it for sentimental reasons (and to keep my  collec-
tion  complete), but I think that I\'ll stop with #60 in the  next
month or two.

From DGP:  World Builder\'s Handbook
           Starship Operator\'s Manual
           101 Vehicles
           Flaming Eye
           Vilani and Vargr
           Solomani and Aslan
           Various Issues of The Traveller\'s Digest and
             MegaTraveller Journal


     World  Builder\'s Handbook expands on the material  on  world
creation  found  in  the Referee\'s Manual.   I  have  no  serious
complaints  with it, use it all the time, and consider it  to  be
the single most useful supplement for the game.

     Starship  Operator\'s Manual provides some interesting  back-
ground  color on ships.  If that appeals to you, it\'ll  be  worth
the  price.  There\'s nothing indispensable, though, if  the  idea
doesn\'t sound intriguing.

     101 Vehicles was one of the first MegaTraveller products  to
be released.  It contains completed designs for 101 ground, grav,
and  near  orbit  vehicles of various types, many  of  which  are
interesting,  and  many of which are silly or  badly  flawed,  or
designed  using  rules errors.  As the  resident  vehicle  design
expert (at 320+ designs, all done by hand <?!?>), I can do better
after years of fussing with the systems and can spot the  errors.
This is not necessarily a good thing, since most of these designs
_could_  be used without the players ever knowing  that  anything
was  wrong.   My overall opinion is that it  can  be  recommended
cautiously.

     Flaming  Eye  is a compilation of two medium  length  adven-
tures.   I didn\'t particularly like them, and wouldn\'t  use  them
myself, but it\'s better than Knightfall, and prepared  adventures
are in extremely short supply for this game.

     Vilani  and Vargr and Solomani and Aslan are excellent  sup-
plements  covering  the major races in and around  the  shattered
Imperium.  The worst part of these books is that the rest of them
will  never be released, leaving the Traveller fan high  and  dry
when  it  comes to running aliens either as players or  as  NPCs.
Those  with  money  and patience can find  the  Zhodani,  K\'Kree,
Droyne, and Hiver alien books from \'classic Traveller\'.

     The  Traveller\'s Digest started as an  independent  magazine
covering  Traveller.  When the editors and staff became  involved
in  the  MegaTraveller revision, the magazine  changed  gradually
into one covering mostly MegaTraveller.  In recognition of  this,
the name was changed to the MegaTraveller Journal, and two issues
were released before DGP gave up the Traveller business last fall
in the wake of the revision fever at GDW, and to pursue their own
game,  AI.  A third issue was planned, and may yet  be  released,
but if it is, it will be the last.  Sic transit gloria mundi.  It
was a good \'zine, and was essentially the \'flagship\' of the whole
game as Challenge gradually dropped coverage.

    Anyway, those are _my_ opinions on a bleak day in March  when
my  mood is black.  Anyone want to start a good thread and  cheer
me up?

Rob Dean commented that Challenge was slowly running less and less
useful MegaTraveller articles and that his interest in it was
dropping.

I can tell you why it\'s running less articles.
They aren\'t getting any.
I would heartily encourage _everyone_ here to write up their favorite
whatever for MT and send it to Michelle Sturgeon at GDW.

	First a real-world example. My wife and I are both in the SCA
(Society for Creative Anachronism, medieval recreation). We both fight.
I.e. we wear suits of armour and hit each other with sticks. I am 5\'10",
she is 5\'4". I weigh #140, she weighs #xxx (acutal number ommited for
diplomacy, consider it to be considerably more than me :-). I.e. I am
"tall" and "thin" and she is "short" and "not-thin". However, we can
both fight effectively wearing each other\'s armour. Actually there are
suits of armour we have that people even taller than me (and shorter
than Lesley) can fight competantly in.
	My personal body armour was made by and for someone of Lesley\'s
proportion (and gender) and her\'s was made by and for someone of her height
and my build. I fought in Canada in armour for someone basically the same
height & weight but the other gender.
	So what I am saying is that, with regard to Medieval plate armour,
we have quite a degree of flexibility. Now custom shaped armour is always
better (I can\'t wear the new legs I\'ve made for Lesley) but will not
greatly inhibit use. If you carry this over to Battle Dress and Traveller
game mechanics the worse I would apply is to increase any task by one
level.

	The second is a literary example. C.J.Cherry\'s "Rimrunners"
goes into some detail on Battle Dress. Since I beleive Traveller has been
a major influence on her works they bear particular relevance. Much of
the tension toward the end of the book is derived through the repair
and fitting of two damaged suits of Battle Dress by a technician/marine.
	It is quite clear in this that because Battle Dress acts as an
amplifier of your actions it must be fitted *precisely*. To do otherwise
sends the user jittering and shaking around the room.
	I reccomend the book to anyone interested in Battle Dress or for
thematic background for Traveller.

	There you go. Two opposite examples :-). Take you pick.

While trying to work up my fleet for the TCS PBEM game, I tried to
game out some ship designs with High Guard.  I quickly came to the
conclusion that the system is a nightmare for "real" situations with
large numbers of opposing ships, fighters, etc.  I can easily imagine
a fight in the PBEM game with a thousand or so ships on a side.

Consequently, I think I\'m gonna look into writing a High Guard combat
moderator.  It should read regular HG listings for ship stats (I\'ll
have to put in some extras for aux. bridge, backup computers and
such) and keep track of individual ships.

Any suggestions or features?  How about what machines/environments to
run it on?  Lowest common system is probably Unix text, with Unix
curses running second ...

Alas, neither of those will do me any good. I\'ve had *very* mixed

I used to send something once in a while, but haven\'t in a long
time.  The main reason being that, frankly, I don\'t own very
much Traveller stuff -- just the OT boxed set (which is why I\'m
not currently trying to get into the PBEM :-) -- and while this
is fun on its own, I was just thinking about buying heavily
into MT stuff to "get current" and doing some things with it
when GDW managed to convince me the game\'s a dead end -- no
future.  No reflection on the typical reader of this group, who
seems to be able to support the game well with little or no
help!  The main reasons I still watch the list are for (1) the
fun physics, and (2) to watch the PBEM(s) (BTW, to the writers
who collate(d) that stuff -- *great job*!  I can imagine how
much work it must be...).  Let me know when some commercial
organization (not necessarily GDW) decides to support something
vaguely resembling OT or MT again, and my interest\'ll perk
right up...

Maybe we should buy the licenses and do it ourselves?  Anybody
interested in working on TDR (under some other name, obviously
:-) on a percentage basis?  The SPARC on my desk here at home
would make a fine desktop publishing station with just a little
work, and --

Medium. I\'ve already talked about \'cocktail\' and \'broad spectrum\' tranq so I
won\'t repeat that again.

  The damage inflicted when they hit are real physical damage (beware of
exceptional successes!), but in addition to this they give a certain fixed
number of extra chemical hits, one at the time. The exact number depends on
the strength of the tranq you are using. Most non-dose-control give 2 to 4
extra depending on the the type of weapon they are used for: Automatic weapons
use strength 2 tranq and single shot weapons give strength 4 tranq.
  If the total damage level (physical and chemical) reduces the character to
unconciousness he is unconcious. If it takes all his hits, he\'s dead.
  All chemical hits will wear off one per hour, or all at once if the victim
is injected with a antidote (in autoinjector form).

  Dose control on the other hand are typically high strength (8 or so) but
the chemical hits will stop to accumulate once the character is unconcious.
It is still possible to die from the physical damage resulting from multiple
tranq hits however.

The Alien Modules.
Now that DPG has left the new alien modules for good, the old ones are sorely
needed.  Probably the best of the missing ones is the Zhodani.  After that
Droyne and maybe Darrians.  DPG has covered the Vargr, Aslan, and Solomani of
the old series.  (Though I prefer the advanced character generations of the
old editions)  After that, K\'kree and Hiver.  These last two are interesting
but not very useable.  I have never even heard of anyone using either 2 of the
modules except to provide a Hiver NPC.  IMHO, the two races are unplayable as
characters.

Book 8: Robots and 101 Robots.
You want robots?  This is the only place you can get them.  101 robots is less
crucial than Book 8, but the added design rules in there are helpful.
These two rank far above K\'kree and Hiver.

With these and the MegaTrav stuff, I\'d say you can get by pretty well.  Every
thing else is nice to have, but little of it is crucial.

*I* like Supp 9 fighting ships and Stiker, but that\'s because I\'m a confirmed
VDN (Vehicle Design Nut).  But Fighting ships is not in MegaTrav format.  And
Stiker has very little in it that MegaTrav doesn\'t.

I *LIKE* the old Traveller Adventure.  That is probably one of the best
adventures they put out.  I wouldn\'t say it is a "Must have" but it certainly
is a "Damn! This is GOOD!"

I would say that just about everything in classic trav helps a bit.  But I
don\'t think that it is *necessary* to have them.

What do you guys think?

How much of a virtual reality system is a holodisplay? I know it is
customizable but that refers to  personal preferences in regards to
layout if I\'m not mistaken.

Is there a capability as in Star Trek TNG for holodecks? Whole rooms
used as virtual reality systems.

When Traveller was created there wasn\'t much talk about virtual
reality systems but now it\'s quite the topic. Even the military is
getting involved in it. I remember coming across something where the
Army has recreated a battle from the Desert Strom action. Using a
warehouse like a holodeck where every detail is taken into account.

How does this fit into Traveller? Any Comments?

with, though, is the idea of broad spectrum tranq. I have run, and hence the
PBEM runs, with the rule that one species\' tranq is another species\' poison.
A tranq made for a Vilani will work on all other humans without trouble, and
will knock out Vargr as well, but it will have no effect at all on a K\'Kree,
kill a Hiver or Droyne dead in its tracks, and drive an Aslan psychotic.

This causes players to be a bit careful whom they shoot. |-\\

This sort of ruling is a necessary evil. That\'s why I invented dose-controlled
tranq (or MCA, metabolically controlled anaesthetic, as my original article
called it) in the first place. There are alternatives, in some cases, to the
amount of physical damage done. See below.

By the time you\'re high-tech enough to have MCA, you\'re high-tech
enough to avoid this sort of thing in most cases. Instead of requiring
intramuscular injection, just mix the tranq with DMSO or something
like it and suffuse it into the bloodstream through the skin. Thus,
*I* have written up items like snub pistol or gauss weapon tranq
rounds as being capsules of this liquid, which spatters into a fine
mist on impact. If a drop gets on exposed skin, you\'re out cold.  Even
better, but requiring a larger round like a shotgun shell or a
grenade, is tranq-gas, a fine suspension that liberally coats a danger
space of a hex or two and can work its way into any clothing that\'s
not air- and watertight. (Footnote: is there any interest in a standard
for grenades that are smaller than the 40mm RAM? Like a 10mm or 20mm?)

For armor, the only alternatives are non-mushrooming DS rounds with a tranq/
DMSO load in them. They get through armor, leave as small a hole as possible,
and ablate anaesthetic as they go through. I think that it would be difficult
to design a round that could get through armor yet be stopped by skin with
only a welt, and as noted above, if a person\'s not in airtight armor like a
combat environment suit, combat armor, or battle dress, then regular mist
rounds can do the job.

              This vehicle is basically an ultralight of the 1990\'s but has
              no wings . It seats 1 person in a cramped seat at the front
              of the craft . It is really just a steel frame with engine and
              seat mountings . It has a 200 liter cargo \'bin\' just behind the
              operators seat . There is a small 20 liter \'glove compartment\'
              just under the operators seat . The cargo bin could be removed
              and two people stand in its place (very preceiously in
              emergencies) with no subtraction to speed and the like . The craft
              has a very long duration in relation to other vehicles . A saftey
              attachment has been made in the area of a small emergency power
              supply should the engine for some reason give out . The batteries
              have enough power to supply the craft for 5 minutes (enough time
              for the pilot to land the craft safely) . It is unenclosed .

              This vehicle can be found on Tarsus . The population there make
              great use of grav vehicles despite their relitvily low tech (10) .
              It is a small \'spotter\' craft which is used in the business of
              farming Noble herds (Rhinocerous type herbivores that run around
              at 50 kph) . The craft \'buzzes\' the herd into moving in certain
              directions . So in away it is roughly the equivilent of a motor-
              bike used for cattle mustering today . The craft looks like a
              terran ultralight of the 1990s save it is a bit bigger and has
              no wings .

              Editors Note : The emergency Supply of batteries has the cost at
              100 times cheaper than the listed book price . However it runs
              at the same output listed in the book . My other designs which
              are tech 9 + and have batteries usually are 10 times the listed
              book price, but due to a suggestion from Scott Kellogg (in this
              design anyway) it is not .  The Maximum Altitude is taken from
              the referees companion on the description of tech 10 grav vehicles
              (ie the max altitude is about a thousand feet) . This is not
              from sea level, but from the ground it is flying above . The
              intake compressors enable it to fly in mountainous areas and
              planets with thin atmosphere . It cannot be used in vaccum unless
              a tank of oxygen is added . It is concevible that someone could
              mount rockets or other weaponary on the craft but thats up to the
              GM I guess .

they made, but this is what I allow, but I would like peoples opinion on it .

Changing Professions

If a character wishes to change professions, he must make an enlistment
roll for that new profession . The following DM\'s are applied . - 1 for
each term before attempting enlistment . - 2 if previous occupation
\'unrelated\' . Brownie Points from the old profession are allowed to be used
on the enlistment procedure, but never again after that (ie once enlists
loose all brownie points) .

Ranks . If previous profession was related, then the rank is Traveller rank
minus two . If caused to go \'below\' rank 1, assume at rank 1 . If previous
profession unrealated then start at the bottom .

Mustering out : The three cash rolls max applied to  total amount of rolls.
Roll for mustering out benefits \'after\' character generation .

Use the above system wisely . For example no characters having escaped from
jail attempting to enlist in the navy .

Related professions would be like a naval character going to the merchant
service, or an army character enlisting in the marines . Any \'Space\' character
going to another\'Space\' profession could be considered related . Also with
the discharge table, a dishonourably discharged character could attempt
to enlist in a criminal profession and count it as \'related\' . Unrelated
professions are like \'Bureacrat to Pirate\' and so forth . Note alot of retired
military personal enter the private sector after service into companies
and the like . So GM\'s might consider extra bonuses for that (for example) .

Many people get anoyed when generating a character only to have him \'die\'
half way through . In cases in my campaign when this happens I do the following
. If the character \'dies\' in the first assignment of the term, round his
career up half a term (say he spent it in hospital) . If dies in 2nd year
dont adjust it . If in third, round it up to a full term (once again say he
spent it in hosptial) if in the fourth leave it where it is . For those
characters who spent that \'extra\' year in hospital optionly allow them to
roll over 7, and get a \'skill\' roll on their \'Life\' Table in their porfession .

Now the medically discharged character wishes to enlist in another service .
This is fine and dont count the term the character was \'wounded\' in as
a DM on enlistment . The reason the character \'adjusted\' his career up above
if for ease in bookkeeping .

Eg Tim the scout has served two terms, but in the first year of term three
fails his survival roll . He spends a year in hospital then attempt to
enlist in the merchant service . The DM\'s are - 2 (Terms) . The profession
of scout and merchant are related enough to ignore the other DM .

It was the intention of the original system to limit densitometers to
scanning an area of 1% of the distance to the area at one time, with a
maximum resolution of 1% of the scan width.  Or, to put it directly in
the terms we are interested in the smallest object that can be discerned
is .0001 times the distance away.  Thus, at 500,000km, no object smaller
than 50km across can be resolved.  In an example from the PBEM game, a
missile turret, perhaps 1m across, could not be resolved from the
background at a distance of more than 10,000m (10km).  The penetration
depth number that has been carried on through the MegaTraveller referee\'s
Manual (e.g. 1km at TL15) is independent of this other limitation, so that
at TL15 you could get a 3D picture of an object to a depth of 1km with
a resolution limited by the range as described above.  To make out a
10m object underground (such as a grav tank bay, for example, drawing on
last summer\'s planetary invasion thread) at a depth of 1km, you would have
to be within 100km of the object.  Thus, you couldn\'t really look \'through\'
a whole planet even without the depth restriction.

difficult...

Marjoram class 400 ton Merchant TL12

     The Marjoram class merchant is a standard Imperial Data Package design,
which has been slightly modified by the inclusion of an upgraded weapon and
sensor suite to reflect the current unsettled conditions in Imperial space.
This version of the Marjoram includes two double beam laser turrets, a triple
missile turret and a triple sandcaster turret for self-defense.  Fuel scoops
are carried for emergency use, but the usual operating practice would be to
purchase unrefined fuel immediately upon landing at a starport, and process
it while cargo loading and unloading is going on. With a jump-3 drive and 2.2
maneuver Gs, the Marjoram can provide ground-to-ground service between most
Imperial starports.  Common variations on the design include removing state-
rooms in favor of additional cargo space, and adding a berth for some sort of
subsidiary craft.  In addition, it is not uncommon for crewmembers to double
up on duties or to run slightly shorthanded, which allows additional state-
rooms for passengers.

I like it.  We have been allowing pretty much unlimited switching of
professions, but your system is rather better and more consistent
with reality ( both as we know it, and as GDW/DGP know it ).

Hmmm... That will change a lot of planetary assault scenarios for sure.
It disagrees with some of the Referee\'s Manual, though.  The "Passive
Object Pinpoint" is supposed to be done entirely with a densitometer, and
under the above guidelines, a densitometer is pretty much useless for
detecting a ship much beyond 1000Km.  Even so, it makes a lot of the
picture
fit better than before, so I think we will have to use that particular gem
from DGP.

Anything else good in TD\'s three and four?

Pick a star type you like off the list.  We (Cynthia & I) assume that any
low tech or Ag world has a comfortable temperature, so a lot of stars from
the standard lists get changed to types V and IV when someone actually
visits a world.

B is in orbit 10.  A has as available orbits for planets orbits 0-4 and
12+.
B itself has a planetary system with orbits 0-5.

We limit such cases to mainworld pop, but pop multiplier must be less than
mainworld pop multiplier.  Except when secondary worlds have lower TL, in
which case I let them have the same pop digit, and a higher pop multiplier
if that\'s the way the dice fall.

Too true.  You can twiddle the albedo quite a lot if you try.  Use Scouts
book if you have it (old Traveller), or just adjust the albedo by up to 20%
in a favourable direction to get a favourable result.  We have a world that
was developed with old Scouts, that has an ice cap covering 60% of the
planetary
surface.  The albedo of the ice keeps world temperature low enough for the
ice cap to exist.  If the ice cap were removed, the world temperature would
rise to 70C+, but the ice cap keeps it at 5C (a little cold, but the
tropics
are nice)

OK.  That\'s one.

THE HORDE

The Horde may be the most effective marketing ploy in the history of
human civilization. It is the only known instance of a single coordinated
advertising/marketing/manufacturing campaign turning a large but
unremarkable company into an Imperially recognized megacorporation,
and its fruits are seen and accepted every day by literally trillions
of people across the entirety of known space. To date, the profits it
has netted its originators have been calculated as being enough to
purchase the fifty most populous and prosperous worlds in the Imperium
and everything on them... and the cashflow shows no signs of slowing down.

In the early centuries of the Third Imperium, starship travel was both
risky and rare, as the regrowing nation strove, often unsuccessfully,
to assure travellers of easy access to the materials and parts they needed
to keep their ships, which represented their lifelines, in working order.
It was not uncommon (as it is now, in the Rebellion, again becoming
common) for a ship to be grounded many parsecs from home because a single
part that could not be replaced by local manufacturers was lost or broken.
Even worse, this situation extended to the much more common nonstarships
that were relied upon in every system even when Jump travel was a lost
art, and forgotten until they broke down and caused trouble by their absence.
Imperial military contractors had some degree of standardization in their
gear, but this suffered from sector to sector as Solomani designers in
firms like GSbAG locked horns with Vilani designers at Sharurshid and refused
to compromise on various design points. This made waging war relatively
straightforward when the ships fought and were built in the same area, as
in the Frontier Wars, but when ships had to be moved across wider ranges
of the Imperium itself, such as in the chaos of the Civil War in the early
600s, the problems of resupply became hellish. There was no guarantee
that a naval fleet could resupply from a depot of the same Navy! The
situation was ripe for change, technological advances into the realm of TL 12
coming at the same time as turmoil and unrest in the political arena,
and it was only a matter of time before someone saw an opportunity to
make money, and leaped on it in a big way. That someone was a tiny company
on a planet with unremarkable characteristics but a fair amount of
historical import, only recently reintegrated into the Third Imperium.
The company was called General SpaceCraft, Inc., and the planet was Terra.

The Horde was conceived of by three young executives working in various
branches at the General home office on Terra. Their names have been
forgotten now, except where reverent design engineers and marketing
strategists have engraved them on their hearts while still in college.
They were led by Peter Broom, an advertising trainee who was already
showing a killer instinct suitable for a Crested Jabberwock. His two
compatriots were Stewart Provost, an Assistant Technician in R&D, and
Shannon Mills, a newly-employed manager in the Shipwrights\' Division, where
actual ship construction took place. The two hardware men were constantly
harangued by their fellow employees for their shared and rather uncommon
penchant for outlandish schemes for making the firm rich. Broom, however,
knew talent when he saw it, and risked the jeers of his superiors in
Marketing when he began sitting with the pair at lunch in the Executives\'
Cafeteria and listening, first with feigned interest and later with genuine
enthusiasm, as The Twins (as they were usually called) sketched out
weird profitmaking ideas on placemats and napkins. Broom\'s business aplomb
flattened most of those ideas in the birthing stages, but the others
didn\'t mind: there was a good, WORKABLE idea in there somewhere, and
sooner or later they\'d find it. And when they did, the Imperium\'s newest
member world was going to give it one hell of a shock.

Their first major breakthrough was the discovery of certain properties of
Tevlac, a plastic recently developed on Warinir and enjoying a fair degree
of popularity among industrial chemists for its sturdiness and easy
machinability. Tevlac, Provost discovered, developed a strong affinity
for temporary molecular rebonding upon fracture lines when stimulated with
a trickle of electric current: it would be broken into pieces, and stick
together along the breaks as long as it was connected to a battery. The
adhesion wasn\'t much, but it was enough to solve one of the starship
industry\'s biggest headaches-- how to get the little hole that always
remains when an Iris Valve closes up to seal airtight every time. Soon,
Tevlac valve-seats were in use all over known space, and the patent money
and licensing fees began flowing in. People took notice of Provost\'s
inventiveness, of the risks Mills took in trying the new technology on the
line, and Broom\'s aggressive marketing of the idea, and lights began
turning green at higher levels of management.

Mills\'s invention of gravitationally-induced hull fitting, where hulls
were friction-fit for spotwelding by the application of tight antigrav
fields, sped up spaceship hulling by 3%-- not much until one considers the
long haul, where it added up to substantial increases in productivity.
This was adopted over pin-fitting by all Imperial Navy contractors by
order of the Navy in 597. But the real boon, and the discovery that
got the corporate gears turning, was the development of the RAMKS by Provost
and Mills in 601. Up until that time, the welding and fitting of superdense
hulls was considered an expensive luxury, due to the difficulties in
getting the impenetrable materials to bond together easily. The RAMKS (an
acronym for Robo-animechaniakatasthyser) was a man-portable device
incorporating fusion and grav technology to induce superfluid states in
confined areas of superdense hullmetal, allowing smooth joins as easily
as two copper pipes could be soldered together with a brazing torch.
The explosion outward of this technology removed the last vestiges of
resistance from the Board of Directors-- what Broom, Provost and Mills
wanted, by God they got it.

The stage was set for the Horde.

In early 604, the three men, now division directors of a rapidly-expanding
company, politely asked to meet with the President and Board in a closed
session. They had, Broom said mildly, an idea. With the dollar signs
barely hidden by their contact lenses, the Board set up the meeting. It
lasted over fourteen hours, and the written records of the session were
kept sealed for nearly two hundred years. But when the meeting let out,
the President looked twenty years younger, the Board were sweating
profusely, and the Three Amigos were grinning like the cats that had just
eaten the canary. The next day, things started moving.

R&D shifted over to component design optimization. Overnight, virtually
all of the R&D division\'s time went into designing structured-modular
avionics and engine control circuitry-- the essential idea being an
interlocking design for electrical and mechanical subsystems with a
stepped degree of throughput based on the Tech Level of each component,
the lowest one in a given subsystem being its least common denominator.
These components were strictly standardized in easily-made forms, and
optimized at Tech Levels ranging from 9 to 13 (the maximum available
at the time). What this meant was that if a module blew, a TL 11 design
could use a replacement fabricated on a TL 9 world with a positive,
documented understanding of exactly which functions would be limited
and how. This degree of centralization was unheard of, except perhaps
among the Vilani megacorporations, whose designs were standardized
by default but uniform by Tech Level with little or no crossreferencing.

At the same time, the Shipwrights began building prototype hulls using
techniques easily available over the same spread of Tech Levels. The
main manufacturing areas were divided into a dozen sample field ship
construction areas, with spotwelders hobnobbing with fusioncutters
and RAMKSers and cable-trays next to fiberbundles and infralinkups.
A microcosm of ship construction techniques under one roof, carefully
hidden from the press by a normally-talkative company, began to get
tongues wagging.

Marketing used the firm\'s past history and future prospects with surgical
precision. Investors eager to cash in on the fledgling firm\'s latest
breakthrough went anywhere from buying shares on speculation to writing
blank development checks. Some of these, like Hortalez et Cie and Antares
Holdings, would later be rewarded with shares in the new company; others,
like Beechcraft Interstellar, would resist going the way of their old
rivals like Cessna and Piper (now a division of GSbAG, which watched the
proceedings with some interest and much discomfort) by merging with General
to profit more directly in what was to come. These were great risks, but as
it turned out, this early risk-taking paid back in incredible measure. The
chaos of the Civil War, which caused a great deal of damage to the Navy and
the Core sector but had little effect elsewhere, merely served as cover
for what happened next.

In 609, ships began leaving Terra for parts unknown. Properties were bought
at starports on many worlds, and carefully sealed off from public view,
first hundreds and then thousands of them. The planning had been meticulous--
each property was tiny, and raised little or no speculation on its own.
No one saw the larger pattern until it was far too late to do anything
about it. By 615, there were worlds from Jewell to Spica with these small
properties on them, and supplies were flowing from local factories to
stockpiles nearby. The only places deliberately avoided were worlds where
the Sharurshid shippers had a stranglehold on the industry-- the Vilani
weren\'t even given a whiff of what was about to happen.

In that same year, advertisements began to be posted on thousands of different
worlds, each bearing the same words: "The Horde is Coming." Public speculation
ran riot, and the overtaxed investors, certain that their long wait was about
to bear fruit, held their breath.

On Holiday of 616, the Horde was unveiled simultaneously on every planet
in the campaign. Local investors took one look at the degree of local
capital involved in the project, and began shoveling money into the
company\'s gaping maw. Shipping firms read the specs, watched the promo
films, conducted tests of their own, and began buying. The project built
up momentum and never stopped. Its first major victory came in 620, when
Tukera Lines began replacing old craft with the Horde. Soon after that,
the first Tech Level Boost Program, a system for upward compatibility
as the Imperial TL climbed, was announced, and the Imperial Navy and
Scout Service began using the Horde for non-critical tasks in thousands
of backwater bases and fringe areas. The final victory came over twenty
years later, when Sharurshid purchased the license fees to begin building
the Horde itself, and the Vilani megacorporation completed what is now
taken for granted as the base standardization of non-milspec ship parts
in the Imperium and surrounds. Broom, Provost and Mills were rather older
by then, but they were present on Vland when the agreement was signed,
and they were present before the throne of Arbellatra a year later when
the Limited Imperial Charter was granted to the new megacorporation of
General Products, LIC.

And what, precisely, WAS the Horde? Let me give as an explanation the words
of Peter Broom, taken from that first board meeting:

"Gentlemen, people are sick and tired of being strangled by the inability
to rely on standardizations when they travel. No one will agree to a set
of standards-- they have to be RAMMED down the shipping industry\'s
collective THROAT. What we are proposing here is not a glamorous action,
or even one that will be remembered, oh, five hundred years from now. What
we are about to do will lay so basic a foundation for the construction
and support of starships and orbital-support spacecraft along accepted
and standardized lines, that our designs and parts will not only be a
household word in a decade or two, but in a century the Vilani will have
caved in as well, and in TWO centuries people will have largely forgotten
that there ever WASN\'T a standard! When people of the year 1100 pick up
a copy of "Traveller: Science-Fiction Gaming in the Distant Past," and
read about the spaceship designs that were just becoming standard when
the Imperium was cracking under its own inertia and those upstarts from
Earth who\'d been in the Imperium for less than twenty years were turning
things on their collective EAR.... I want them to read about OUR designs."

And so it has been. Although General Products has taken a lot of flak
recently for its starship designs, its spacecraft, now manufactured
under subcontract by every shipping firm in the Imperium to some degree
or another, are so standard as to have been forgotten... and the industry
has upgraded them as the Tech Level advances, so that they are now on
the market from TL9 to TL16, with TL17 designs on the way.

Or, in game-design terms--

We the designers (Scott Kellogg and Rob Dean) and the storyteller/historian
(metlay his-SEFF) are proud to ceremoniously dump upon the TML community
a collection of standardized and Imperially accepted "norm" designs for
non-Jumping support craft of every type, guaranteed to work better at
all TLs than the designs written up in the MT rules and to serve in each
and every campaign that requires a TL-appropriate "vanilla ship" for
any purpose at all....

Well, you could always stick to detailing worlds from the official sectors,
where I haven\'t observed this particular problem.  However, I suspect that
you should probably just use the +4 modifier on type, rather than on both
type and size.  This will make most \'good\' worlds planets of FV stars, but\'s
that\'s better than dwarfs.

Sure.  No need to shout. (-:  You are correct in your example: Star A would
have planets at orbits 0-4 and 12+ (if necessary), and Star B would be in
Star A\'s orbit 10, with orbits 0-5 of its own.  Just imagine Jupiter as a
star, and all those moons as its planets and you\'re all set.

Sounds like a reasonable solution.  In practice, I would expect that mainworlds
which are also gas giant moons should be fairly scarce.  In any other situation
the -5 and -3 modifiers for inner and outer zone planets will tend to reduce
populations below the mainworld.  Every once in a while you could allow an
assymetrical situation such as you describe as long as you can come up with a
good explanation, but generally, I\'d adjust or reroll.

Yes, this is a bit of a problem.  Sometimes you can adjust the temperature
a bit by moving the world a little closer to the fire, or pulling it back
out a bit, but \'jungle planets\' or \'iceballs\' do seem to outnumber temperate
planets.  Temperate planets only stay temperate, you\'ve noticed, if they have
a nice dense atmosphere.  Otherwise nighttime cooling can cause summer night
frosts, which I expect could be a problem for many food crops of Terran origin.

Type R Merchant TL13

     The Type R merchant is a standard Imperial design, suitable for servic-
ing a cluster of closely spaced civilized worlds.  Fitted with a minimal
maneuver drive, the Type R may not land or take off from a planet with a
local gravity of more than 0.9Gs while fully loaded, and is frequently de-
pendent on the use of orbital facilities.  A launch is carried to provide
some capability for servicing worlds where landing is not practical.  No
weapons are shown in the ship below, although 54kl of volume have been re-
served for the installaion of up to four turrets, and the basic control
system can handle any weapons installation of up to MCr12 base cost.
     In the current unsettled conditions prevailing in the Imperium, Type R
merchants such as this are frequently found carrying both a substantial
weapons array and improved sensor systems.

Type R2 Merchant TL13

     The Type R merchant is a standard Imperial design, suitable for servic-
ing a cluster of closely spaced civilized worlds.  However, many worlds are
not located in such favorable positions, and ships with more capable jump
dirves are needed to service them.  Thus jump-2 and jump-3 versions of stand-
ard jump-1 vessels are frequently encountered in the Imperium.  This R2 can
be built using many of the same standard assemblies used by the basic Type R.
Like the basic Type R, the R2 shown below is fitted with a minimal maneuver
drive, and may not land or take off from a planet with a local gravity of
more than 0.9Gs while fully loaded, and is frequently dependent on the use of
orbital facilities.  A launch is carried to provide some capability for
servicing worlds where landing is not practical.  No weapons are shown in the
ship below, although 54kl of volume have been reserved for the installaion of
up to four turrets, and the basic control system can handle any weapons
installation of up to MCr12 base cost.
     In the current unsettled conditions prevailing in the Imperium, Type R2
merchants such as this are frequently found carrying both a substantial
weapons array and improved sensor systems.

    'body' => 'First a thankyou to the people who responded to my earlier questions
on system design, it was very helpful ........

What is the opinion of people about the command crew in Megatraveller
The book says (basically) 1 for every 6 crew . Now This has probably been
discussed before, but as I can no longer get access to the TML provided
by James Perkins, I dont know what the ending result was .

I think (as someone already pointed out, rob dean I think) that the
command crews are awfully bloated . I mean it really does not take
1 officer just to oversee the actions of 6 people . Another thing is, is
the command crew the officers . That is only command crew are the officers .
So according to the Imp Encyclopedia, The amount of officers is 1  (As in
one command personel) . Or is this the amount of officers on command duty ???

If we take a look at Star Trek the series (the old, not the new generation),
It is porbably the closest thing we have in modern film that ressembles the
navy . Now on the bridge we had Captain James T.Kirk (Commander of vessel),
Spock (Commander, Science/Computer Officer), Sulu (Lt Cmmdr (?) Pilot),
Chercov (Pilot or navigator, Lieutenant ?), Uhura (Lieut, Comm Officer) . Now
all of these people were officers, and all of them were bridge crew and
acted in Bridge areas . How does thios fit into MT ?

The old High Guard book said the average vessel had a commanding officer,
an executive officer, a pliot (officer) a navigator (an officer), a
Comm officer, oh another nav officer, a medical officer . It then goes on to
list officers needed for the other areas of the vessel such as engineering
and gunnery .

So we could have this as solution (By converting High Guard guidelines to
fit MT) .

Bridge : 75% Officers, 25% Ratings/NCOs
Engineering :  10% Officers, 20% NCO\'s, 70% Ratings
Gunnery : 10% Officers, 30% NCO\'s, 60% Ratings
Flight Crew : All pilots officers, all others are NCO\'s/Ratings
Ships Troops : Use military guidelines
Maintenance : Usually just NCOs\'/Ratings
Medical : Not sure, I would say same proportions as the Bridge .
Stewards : Not sure, proably the same as gunnery .

To convert MT ships to this, I would simply divide the command personel
amongsnt the above \'duties\' (but rationly) then work out officers as above

Officers probably would have their own staterooms (But small) .

What do people think about that ????????

Make sense etc .

BTW I would remove the maintenance section and stewards section and use the
old High Guard guidelines for service crew (ie 2 or 3 per 500 tons) .

Officers for service crew would be 5%, NCO\'s 20%, and ratings 75% .

If anyone has their own guidlines for this please, could you give me a copy ?

I wonder if GDW knows that EGG is not exactly the revered father of it all

	The engine temperature jumped five degrees in two minutes.
"We\'re coming out of jump." Shtam called from the engine room.
	"Look," muttered Miakr softly, "I\'m really..."
	Shtam cut him off.  "Don\'t worry about it.  I\'d have a lot
of trouble handling these engines by myself.  As it is, you may
have saved us all from blowing up.  Misjump is no big deal."

to relativistic space." called Shtam, "Three minutes.  All hands
to stations."

Jiet, let\'s get ready." he slapped her shoulder through the
battle dress.  "Any pirates just better watch out."
	"I\'d rather not have to deal with any more battles for a
while." cautioned Jietlshaiepr.  "We\'re looking for a hospital,
not a fight.  With Drert still in the ozone layer and Shtam minus
his leg, I have enough headaches.  You just find us a starport.
I\'ll take it from there.

I am NOT looking forward to what reception we may get when we re-
enter normal space.  A misjumped ship is a very juicy target, and
pirate activity has been getting awfully heavy these days."
	"Sure, Jiet." barked the vargr wagging her tail.  "I
wouldn\'t worry too much though, we\'re probably in human space.
Human corsairs aren\'t worth much.  And if we jump into vargr
space I knew most of the corsair leaders."
	"Why\'d you decide to hook up with humans then?"
	"Well, Oddball was slowing down."  she laughed, then curling
her lip exposing the sharp canine teeth of her species, "And the

the jump drives.  She panted and wheezed at the exertion while
she wiped the haze from her eyes and began to look around, wondering
where she\'d got to.

the position of the stars, I\'d say no more than six or seven

diameters out from a gas giant... Looks like there are some
pretty big power emissions, lots of neutrinos, probably a mid to
high tech system.  I hope their hospitals are in as good shape as
their power systems..."
	"Picking up a radar beacon..." she announced.  "Radio signal
incoming."
	A woman\'s voice came over, "...entified craft, come in
please... Repeat, unidentified craft come in please, this is the
F.A.B. patrol ship Flamboyant.  You will identify yourself
immediately."
	Jietlshaiepr raised her eyebrow. "Hold on a minute here...
This is a tight beam transmission."
	"So?" asked Niedrsha.
	"So, why conceal your presence if you are a patrol ship?"
	"Right... broadcast to the ship and the traffic at the gas
giant.  Come to think of it, relay their messages too."
	Jietlshaiepr hit the broadcast button.  "This is the Zhodani
Courier Kliemoshie, ZC-00113.  State your business patrol ship
Flamboyant."
	"We are on anti-pirate cruise.  Have no record of your
arrival, Kliemoshie.  Stand by."
	Jietlshaiepr tuned the ship\'s antenna to a tight beam aimed
at the gas giant.  "This is the Zhodani Courier Kliemoshie,
ZC-00113.  Request confirmation of status of patrol ship
Flamboyant."
	She read the sensors, "The Flamboyant is closing on us at
four G acceleration, four hundred tons, streamlined, five point
two five gigawatts from their reactor.  Reads out as a Fiery
class Imperial gunned escort.  Usual armament lasers and particle
accelerators."
	"Flamboyant to Kliemoshie, we have no record of your arrival
in system, please confirm."
	"Viepchakl!" thought Jietlshaiepr. "Kliemoshie to
Flamboyant, have just arrived in system."
	"Got another contact, she announced.  Much larger, ten
gigawatt reactor, eight hundred tons, approaching at five G\'s.
at extreme range and on intercept course."
	"Flamboyant to Kliemoshie, we have orders to board and
inspect all shipping.  Stop engines and prepare to receive our
party."
	A new voice came over the circuits.  "Kliemoshie, this is
Fan Belt starport control, we have no record of any patrol ship
registered as Flamboyant.  Proceed with caution.  Will send patrol
to investigate."
	"Niedrsha, get us the hell out of here!  Red alert!  All
hands shut airlocks and close battle dress."
	"Engine room.  Give her everything you\'ve got!" shouted
Niedrsha.  The Kliemoshie\'s frame squealed in protest.  "Gresha,
commence firing!"
	Gresha couldn\'t hear the order for the rattle of the
sandcaster pumping ablative sand out to shield the fleeing
courier.  She knew her business.  She needed no order.  Laser
light streamed from the turret searching for a victim.
	It swung wide of the target.  The gun ship twisted and
loosed its own onslaught of destructive energy.
	The very space around the Kliemoshie glowed with the
incoming fire as it vaporized the protective sand cloud and
touched the skin of the ship.
	Jietlshaiepr read off "We\'ve been hit.  No damage, just
cooked a bit.  Hull temperature four hundred thirty Kelvin.  No
hull rupture...  I read a flight of ships from the gas giant...
six G\'s acceleration, including a ship in the twenty thousand ton
range...at this range it will take an hour and thirty eight
minutes to intercept.  Second contact I read out as a Guppy class
cruiser.  Usual armament: lasers, missiles, sandcasters.  It will
be in range in sixty seven minutes."
	"What about the Flamboyant?" called Niedrsha.
	"Closing, interception thirty six minutes."
	Lasers swept out towards the pursuer on target.
	The Flamboyant\'s hull was momentarily lost in a fog cloud.
	"Good shooting Gresha!  I read that out as a hit to their
fuel tanks." called off Jietlshaiepr.
	"They\'ve still got their teeth." growled Gresha.  "I just
poked their stomach a bit."
	Laser flare obliterated the Kliemoshie\'s sand cloud.
	"Next one will penetrate." warned Gresha.
	The Kliemoshie began to shudder as Niedrsha redoubled his
efforts to evade.  The spiralling ship rolled and pitched,
straining the ability of the anti-acceleration-grav fields, while her
lasers flamed outward.
	One of the Flamboyant\'s turrets melted away under the jet of
Gresha\'s lasers.
	A flash of light, a blast, a shudder.  Part of the
Kliemoshie turned into slag.
	"Report in!  Anyone hurt?"  Called Jietlshaiepr.
	"Shtam here.  Engine Room intact.  Miakr, Vole and I are
Ok."
	"Gresha here.  Turret unimpaired."
	"The Air/Raft bay was destroyed." announced Drert as though
he was talking in his sleep, "Pressure leak in quarters section.
Bulkheads and frame intact."
	"How in Viepchakl does he know that?" wondered Jietlshaiepr.
	Lasers flared out again but found only empty space.
	"Grrraahcht!" barked Gresha in frustration.
	The Flamboyant\'s lasers reached out and licked the
Kliemoshie\'s hull.  Fog fumed from the gash draining away the
life blood fuel of the courier.
	"Fuel pressure\'s goin... gone.  Fuck!" shouted Niedrsha.
	"Fusion plant shutting down!" screamed Miakr.
	All lights went out aboard the courier leaving all in total
darkness.
	Red emergency lights came on dimly.
	"Batteries on emergency power.  That is all I can do.  We
were low on fuel after the jump, now it is all gone." Shtam
announced calmly.
	Silence came down like a sudden nightfall.  The ship was dead.
	Jietlshaiepr finally broke the silence.  "Stand by to repel
boarders."
		- III -
	The ship was quickly depressurized.  Crew assembled in the
lounge armed with gauss rifles.
	"Twelve crew in a Fiery class escort.  Sixteen in a Guppy
class cruiser, plus a complement of sixteen troops." reported
Shtam.  "The Guppy is an ideal pirate raider.  We ran into them
in the merchants.  They have a huge cargo capacity:  able to
accommodate over three hundred tons of ships.  They just open
their clamshells and swallow you.  I saw one eat a free trader
and still have room for two fifty ton fighters."
	"We have to stand them off long enough for the patrols to
arrive.  That\'s two hours without our engines.  The Flamboyant
will rendezvous in twelve minutes, the Guppy in forty nine."
Jietlshaiepr paced appraising the situation.  "Shtam, how well
can you move without that leg?"
	"With the ship\'s artificial grav off, I\'m fine.  A little
slower but adequate.  It seems to be regenerating itself.  It
beats me what Drert did to it though."
	"Right.  Boarding party...  Tactics...  Suggesions?"
	"Ambush." growled Gresha.
	"Set up where?  Where are they going to come in?"
	"They might not board at all until we\'re inside the Guppy\'s
cargo hold." thought Niedrsha.
	"No." said Shtam decisively, "In order to get the ship into
the hold they will have to have men handling her very carefully.
They will not chance our taking on a busy work crew."
	"Well, if I were them, I\'d burn through the hull." growled
Gresha, "They want the ship.  Why else call in another ship
capable of carrying her out?  Ships go for good money in this low
tech sector.
	"The front wind screen\'s easy to smash and board through,
but it\'d get the bridge shot up.  Airlock is harder to fix than
the hull.  Hull material is cheap, sections of it are already
damaged.  Probably come in through the Air/Raft bay, it\'s already
smashed.  Can set up ambush there."
	"Right." nodded Jietlshaiepr.  "Good thinking.  Miakr, you
and Vole inspect the bay, find the best place to setup an ambush.
Niedrsha, you cover the bridge.  Yell if you see anything and get
out.  Shtam, you cover the airlock.  Gresha, you ever been
teleported?"
	Gresha cocked her head confusedly.  "No."
	"I can carry two of us in a teleport.  I bet we could jump
out, get in a few good shots and catch them off guard."
	"We could use the tech fourteen plasma guns:  no recoil."
snarled Gresha with a wagging tail.
	"Exactly."
		- IV -
	"Miakr, their headed your way." radioed Niedrsha from the
bridge.  "Good call Gresha!"
	"How many?" demanded Jietlshaiepr.
	"Eight, two in combat armor, six in vacc suits.  The ones in
combat armor are guarding the airlock.  The rest are headed to
the Air/Raft bay with some laser welders.  The ones in combat
armor have laser rifles, the rest have accelerator rifles.  I
think most have snub pistols as well."
	"They\'ve started cutting." announced Vole.   "Estimated time
of entry:  seven minutes forty seconds... Mark!"
	"Right.  Niedrsha, you get down to the bay and help Miakr.
Gresha, we\'ll pay a little visit in two minutes, let\'s move to
the lock."
	Gresha growled softly to herself.
		- V -
	"Grakvozan!  Teleportation is neat!" wondered Gresha with awe
as she found herself outside the ship shoulder to shoulder with
Jietlshaiepr.
	Twin figures floated out side the airlock of the Kliemoshie.
	Twin plasma bolts leaped across the vacuum.
	Twin explosions.
	Twin figures spiraled into the vacuum, leaving a cloud of
vaporized organs and metal.
	"Better than I\'d hoped for.  All right team, come out the
airlock, we may be able to press this attack home."  Jietlshaiepr
turned.  The bay was hidden by the bulk of the ship.  "Bring out our
gauss rifles as well.  If we get aboard the Flamboyant, plasma guns
are a bit much."
		- VI -
	With the power off the airlock had to be opened by hand, but
Niedrsha and Miakr had gotten through by the time the sentries
were missed.
	Two vacc suit helmets peered around the bulk of the hull
before they were seared off by Gresha and Jietlshaiepr.
	"That\'ll scare the fuck out of \'em." observed Niedrsha.
	"Four on four." thought Miakr.  "Let\'s take \'em."
	They split up and jetted around the ship\'s hull to see the
four pirates in flight.  The Flamboyant\'s airlock was wide open.
Miakr opened up on the trailing pirate.  Gauss needles flew
undeflected, and unerringly to the target which clamped its leg
as it fired at Niedrsha.
	The accelerator rifle bullet rammed its way through
Niedrsha\'s armor over his right arm, almost spoiling his aim.
His own gauss needles went home on the smallest of the pirates.
The helmet simply exploded.  The corpse continued to float toward
the Flamboyant\'s looming hull.
	Suddenly, Drert appeared next to Niedrsha and both vanished.
	Two plasma bolts struck the third pirate which completely
vaporized the fleeing man.
	Bullets clicked off Jietlshaiepr\'s armored torso.
	"Hey you!  Lay off my chest!"  An indignant blast of plasma
subdivided the fourth pirate from it\'s groin and lower legs which
tumbled into the vacuum.
	Miakr\'s second volley of shots shredded the remaining
pirates legs.  The body hung limply, suspended in space.
	The Flamboyant started moving.
	"Viepchakl!" shouted Jietlshaiepr.  She teleported into the
open airlock and was slammed against the side of the ship.  She
quickly looked through the view port and then teleported inside.
	She would have jumped a kilometer had it not been for the
ceiling.
	"Hi Jiet!  Welcome aboard." laughed Niedrsha as Drert stood
over him.
	"To the bridge.  How\'s your arm?"  without waiting for an
answer she ran ahead.
	"Never better."
	None of them had been aboard a Fiery class escort before but
the bridge was pretty easy to guess at.
	The pilot heard them coming.  She had a snub pistol trained
at the corridor and loosed high explosive bullets at Jietlshaiepr
as she burst through.
	Six shells exploded harmlessly on Jietlshaiepr\'s chest
plates.
	"Leave my tits alone, bitch!"  Jietlshaiepr slapped the
panicked pilot in the mouth.  The strength enhancement of the
battle dress rocked her head back and laid her neck at an ugly
angle.
	Niedrsha pulled her from the console and swung the ship into
a spin.  "Fuck those Imperial designers!"  He soon had it under
control and headed back to the Kliemoshie.
	Jietlshaiepr grabbed the scanners.  There was one more crew
member aboard.  The Guppy class cruiser would rendezvous in
twenty six minutes.
	"One last crew member aboard." she explained, "I\'ll take
care..."
	"Not any more." said Drert simply.  He then sat down on the
deck and began opening the chest of his battle dress.
	"How..." she started to ask, but noticed Drert was lost in
an examination of his belly button, then checked the scanners.
the only life on board was them.
		- VII -
	The crew was quickly transferred to the Flamboyant.
	"Ghrresh!" barked Gresha from the dorsal turret, "Where is
the particle accelerator?"
	"What\'s wrong?" shouted Jietlshaiepr.
	"This is a missile turret.  There\'s an Air/Raft bay here
instead of the particle barbette and... Grraaah!  Verracht!  This
ship carries nuclear missiles!"
	"What!?"
	"This turret is armed with nuclear missiles!"
	"Guppy class cruiser, twenty one minutes to interception."
read off Shtam.  "Patrol cruisers:  one hour forty minutes.  I
make the large ship in the patrol out as a Viepchakl class Battle
rider.  I think we should give some of these missiles back to
their rightful owners?"
	"My sentiment\'s exactly, Shtam." nodded Jietlshaiepr.
	"Graah, just say the word, Jiet and I\'ll stuff some
plutonium down their throats." snarled Gresha.
	Shtam studied the sensors.  "They are coming in on a nice
lateral course.  No sandcasters in operation, no evasive action,
just a nice fat target.  They have even opened the cargo bay
doors."
	"Gresha," sighed Jietlshaiepr, "They\'re hungry, why don\'t
you give them a nice mouthful or two?"  She stretched herself in
such a way that, even with her battle dress on, made one want to
throw back one\'s head and howl.
	"Well Jiet," laughed Gresha, "I\'ll try but I just don\'t have
your... qualifications."
	The black face plate of her battle dress hid her reaction.
"Stand by for evasive action.  Hands to what ever stations you can
find.  Gresha, fire when ready."
	A soft shush announced the departure of the nuclear warhead
laden missiles.
	"Nukes away!...  Engine\'s hot and running."
	"Evasive action!" barked Jietlshaiepr.  "She\'s starting to
evade.  Where are those lasers?"
	Drert fired on the gaping maw of the approaching cruiser.
Just as the bay began to close the laser strike bore in blasting
the decks adjoining.  Fuel leaked into space flaming briefly as
it combined with the leaking air of the ship and then snuffing
out as flame met vacuum.
	The jaws jammed fast leaving a leaking flaming mouth open to
vacuum.  Seconds later the missiles streaked into the hungry
mouth of the cruiser.
	A blinding flash came out of the belly of the cruiser.  The
silhouetted form of the top half of the ship was barely visible
above the brilliance of the brief fission powered star.
	Half of the ship tumbled, glowing white hot and radioactive
from the blaze.  End over end she tumbled for three seconds then
it flared again and was gone.
	An expanding cloud of radioactive plasma blew into space.
		- VIII -
	Jietlshaiepr slouched back in the command chair exhausted.
She opened the clamshell helmet of her battle dress and sighed.
"All right." she purred.  "Now, I am a little bit tired of being
shot at today.  Shtam, you said that the ship headed towards us
is a Viepchakl class battle rider."
	"Yes.  She is unmistakable."
	"Ok, now.  The only ship that carries the Viepchakl in this
area is based in Tloql sector at Chronor.  That being the Zhdant
itself:  a one million ton battle carrier.  What on the moons of
Zhdant is the pride of the Consular Navy doing here?  Fan Belt is
an independent system." she pondered aloud.  "Well, I guess we\'ll
just have to talk to them.  But as soon as we hit the starport,
we\'re going to bed."
		- IX -
	It took some explaining indeed.  The ship turned out to be
the Viepchakl itself, named for the once worshiped moon of Zhdant
which still bore some reverence or irreverence as the case may
be.  The captain of such a ship commands respect.  But, the last
thing he expected to hear was a report from an overtired and
voluptuous noble who had just captured the ship he was supposed to
be rescuing her from.
	The questions came tumbling out.  Where was the owner of the
Kliemoshie:  Dr. Malenkoviepr?  Why did the ship misjump?  How
did they contact the Flamboyant?  How did they take the
Flamboyant?  Were there any injuries that needed treatment?  Were
there any survivors among the pirates?  And where did they get
Ultra top of the line Zhodani Noble Commando battle dress and
Imperial plasma guns?
	Fortunately, the captain was familiar with those Zhodani who
worked with the Ine Givar and some sticky little questions got by
with the slimmest answers.
	The Flamboyant was towed to the starport by the Viepchakl
while the Kliemoshie was refueled by three Zhdits class D.E.\'s
and brought in under armed escort.
		- X -
	Jietlshaiepr never got a chance to keep her promise.  Four
minutes after docking Jietlshaiepr was requested to see
Tlievriashav.  Request it was, and polite too, but one does not
make the High Consul of the entire Ikar sector wait.
	Five hours later, a quite exhausted, curvaceous commando
trudged up the ramp of the courier.
	"Better start packin\' your stuff, crew.  The Kliemoshie\'s
being commandeered tomorrow at thirteen hundred hours."
	"What!?" came the unanimous response of disbelief.
	"Tlievriashav\'s taking her.  He needs a courier for his
consular cruiser.  His own was destroyed or captured by probably
the self same pirates we just fought.
	"We are to be given possession of the Flamboyant, *minus* the
nuclear missiles.  We have to go to Massina first but then she\'ll
be turned over to us."
	"Massina Belt!" exploded Miakr, "Why there?"
	Jietlshaiepr looked at him startled. "Well, they want to run
a number of tests on the ship to find out what they can from it.
To get a lead on these pirates.  Best place to run the tests is at
the sector capital."
	"What about Dr. Malenkoviepr?" asked Niedrsha.
	"We\'ll need a ship to find him.  And the old "Moshie" is
going on to bigger circles."
	"Why?  What\'s going on here?" asked Shtam.  "Why does a big
wheel like Tlievriashav want a broken down shot up old courier like
the Kliemoshie?"
	"You\'ve all heard of Horltheur?  Highest tech planet in the
Ikar sector, and one of the most volatile.  There\'s been a war."
	"Big war?" asked Shtam.
	"Yeah, nuclear.  The whole northern continent was just about
wiped out.  The Zhdant is going there escorting hospital ships
from the Consulate and Fan Belt.  Tlievriashav needs a courier,
and the Kliemoshie is the only one available.
	"Big political push:  influence gathering.  The Imperium is
sending a fleet of it\'s own hospital ships.  Accompanied by their
fleet.  The Darrians, the Sword Worlds, The Dynchia, all the
governments, big and small, they\'re all sending ships.  A big
humanitarian effort that all sides can milk for propaganda values,
and maybe save a few lives in the bargain."
	"How does the Fan Belt fit in?" wondered Niedrsha.
	"It\'s the medical capital of the sector.  We can gain
influence with them while we prove to all that the Consulate is
just as humane as the Imperium if not more so."
	"Wait a minute, what about recompence for the doctor?" asked
Gresha.
	Jietlshaiepr laughed.  "Now this is the crazy part, the doc
will get his money, but he\'s not receiving money for the value of
the ship, he\'s getting the *replacement* value.  Full cost of a
new courier.  And I have custody of the money till he is found:  one
hundred and one million, six hundred seventy one thousand, six
hundred and fifty credits.
	"Now you\'ve got the whole story.  We\'ll have enough time
here to use the medical facilities before we leave for Massina."
She stretched out in a mouth watering way, leaned over calmly and
picked up Niedrsha and threw him over her shoulder.
	"Now, Niedrsha, there are a couple of things I need to go
over with you..."  Suddenly, they were gone.  Or rather, they
were gone, their clothes stayed behind.  They stood there like a
bizarre artwork for a moment in the positions Jietlshaiepr and
Niedrsha had been in.  Then, they slowly floated to the deck of
the cabin.
	"Now that," observed Gresha admiringly "is a trick I\'ve GOT
to learn."

In the Alien volume on Villani and Vargr by DGP, there are two reference
to a group called the Society of Equels ("Dzen Aeng Kho") based in the
Gvurrdon system in the Dzveronguoe Sub-Sector.  Both are passing references,
one of which is buried in the example of systems in vargr space.  The other
reference makes a passing mention as the Dzen Aeng Kho as being a somewhat
restrictive government (compared to the merchant line being described
in the text).

I am sorry I can\'t cough up page numbers - my traveller
references reside far from this terminal, and I was lucky enough to
remember the piece of paper with the name and planet info...I\'ve only been
forgetting to post this inquiry for three or four weeks now...

What I\'d like to know is: is there any info on this organization anywhere?
Or is the name dropping of the Dzen Aeng Kho all there is?  Inquiring minds
(me and my GM) want to know...

Thanks!

At less than 5 meters a person with pistol-2 can hit someone wearing the

The Traveller Alien series (aborted at two out of five books by the abrupt
departure of DGP from the Traveller business, may they go Chapter 11 for
their sin (not of abandoning us, but of stupidity: AI looks like the dumbest
game since, well, since MegaTraveller. But I digress)) contains a lot of 
useful data on the history and cultural background of these four races, 
including character rollup info, but without the advanced character gen
stuff in the old GDW series. Since the two series do not conflict with
one another in any substantive way (all you rules lawyers out there who
want to argue missing lines and skill eligilbilities, please shut up and
go away), I regard them ALL as essential, ten volumes in all (two by DGP
and eight by GDW).

Catie, the only data on the Society of Equals that has ever been published
anywhere is what you have before you. Sorry.

BTW, was anyone else as offended as I was at "Wolfsport"? What a totally
bozotic and monochrome representation of the Vargr. And here I\'d been
hoping that the Antares article was a sign of an upward trend....

I just finished creating 20 new PBEM packages available at Sunbane via
ftp and via email from here (Metolius). The data in the new packages are
the PBEM turns which appeared on the TML in 1991 and in 1992.

To get the packages, ftp to sunbane.engrg.uwo.ca [129.100.100.12], and
cd to the pub/traveller/pbem directory. In there you will find files
named PB1 through PB35. The new files are PB16 through PB35. If you\'ve
been reading the TML or PBEM the last couple years, you will probably
not want to bother :-).

Virtual reality systems are being created now and certainly present

I would imagine a similar setup to a Holodeck is feasible in Traveller.
If holodisplays are available for workstations they should be easy
enough to erect in a larger setting, such as a building. Now, I\'ll
agree that simulating other sensory data might be a little difficult
but they could be introduced as chemical sprays. I would imagine
pharmacology has advanced enough that hallucinogenic drugs are
pretty common and powerful. They could allow one to experience all

You could say that for most of their technology! I have a hard time
with the low tech planets they visit, especially the Federation ones.

Another point I\'d like to bring up is frictionalless surfaces. What
would be the technology level required to produce it? Could it be
produced with varying results, such as level 1 would be 10%, level
2 20% and so on, or is the nature of the material such that it would
be all or nothing?

hyper-aggressive morons managed to survive long enough to settle an area
that is about as large as the Imperium if not larger!

Another disturbing trend I\'ve found in recent magazines is the lack of
thought going into the prep of the adventures they\'ve put out.  In Wolfsport,
the players are challenged to a fight in an arena with the current champion.
The author then goes on to outline a lot of possible outcomes and actions the
players might take.

But NOWHERE does he even mention the idea that the players might enter the
arena, take on a highly motivated, very strong vargr with Infighting-4, and
tactical skill, who is hopped up on combat drug, and LOSE!  This seems the
most likely outcome to me!

Another recent article had the players trapped in a room with a sniper on the
roof.  They were required to climb up a rope ladder to get to him while under
fire from the sniper.  The sniper had a gauss rifle and Combat Rifleman-5!
SURE!  How many players are gonna be left?

Another recent article had the players find several Zhodani hiding in a
packing crate.  No mention of what the heck they are doing.  They\'re just
there.  Ah-Yup!

An old issue of CHALLENGE has an article set on the politics of the

really did a lot to fill out the thin spots in the character I\'m

Here are my two cents worth with the caveat that I am not a Chemist/Physicist/
Materials Scientist.

I would say that any particular material would have a constant coefficient of
friction, with perhaps, slight variations due to different alloying materials
and manufacturing techniques used.  However, it should be possible to make new
materials with lower and lower coefficients of friction, probably dependant on
tech level.
     up to TL  8 normal
           TL  9 20% Friction Free
           TL 10 30% FF
           TL 12 50% FF
           TL 13 60% FF
           TL 15 80% FF
           TL 16 90% FF
           TL 17 99% FF

It will probably be \'impossible\' to create matter that is totally friction-
free, but forcefields are another matter. 8+)  Another thing to consider is
the other characteristics of the material.  Is it brittle?  Melts at low temps?
Hard to machine?  Poisonous to humans?

What would it be used for?  Sidewalks? (probably not)  Engine bearings? (yes)
Wheels? (no, wheels depend on friction to work)  Recreation?  (sure)  How about
the equivalent of water slides (have to be totaly enclosed or you would flip
out at the first turn) or downhill skiing? (you can only go straight down the
hill cause you need friction to turn)  Other than things like engine bearings,
the biggest use would be recreation.

An alternative to frictionless materials is the \'Friction field generator\'
(invented by James Blish in one of his _Cities_in_Flight_ books).  I can\'t
remember the exact explanation given (which may have been BS anyway...), but
the effect was to reduce (or increase!) the friction coefficient of ANY matter
within its field.  I would tend to place this invention at TL 19 or more.

I had this great idea several years ago for a material, one of whose secondary
characteristics, is that it was frictionless.  It had other properties which
I won\'t go into here, because one of the guys in the campaign listens in here
(hi Jay!), and I may start it up again in the future.  If anyone is interested,
I\'ll be happy to explain further by email.

Presumably they use something to make tech 13 holodynamic controls
work. I always figured it was some sort of energy pulse to the
appropriate neurons that fooled the operator into thinking he was

Two years ago the FCC tried and (with your help and letters of protest)
failed to institute regulations that would impose additional costs on modem
users for data communications.

Now, they are at it again.  A new regulation that the FCC is quietly working
on will directly affect you as the user of a computer and modem.  The FCC
proposes that users of modems should pay extra charges for use of the public
telephone network which carry their data.  In addition, computer network
services such as CompuServ, Tymnet, & Telenet would also be charged as much
as $6.00 per hour per user for use of the public telephone network.  These
charges would very likely be passed on to the subscribers.

The money is to be collected and given to the telephone company in an effort
to raise funds lost to deregulation.

Jim Eason of KGO newstalk radio (San Francisco, CA) commented on the
proposal during his afternoon radio program during which, he said he learned
of the new regulation in an article in the New York Times.  Jim took the
time to gather the addresses which are given below.

Here\'s what you should do (NOW!):

 1- Pass this information on.  Capture the information which contains
    the text you are reading now.  Find other BBS\'s that are not
    carrying this information.  Upload the ASCII text into a public
    message on the BBS, and also upload the file itself so others can
    easily get a copy to pass along.

 2- Print out three copies of the letter which follows (or write your
    own) and send a signed copy to each of the following:

         Chairman of the FCC
         1919 M Street N.W.
         Washington, D.C. 20554

         Chairman, Senate Communication Subcommittee
         SH-227 Hart Building
         Washington, D.C. 20510

         Chairman, House Telecommunication Subcommittee
         B-331 Rayburn Building

Here\'s the suggested text of the letter to send:

   Dear Sir,

   Please allow me to express my displeasure with the FCC proposal
   which would authorize a surcharge for the use of modems on the
   telephone network. This regulation is nothing less than an attempt
   to restrict the free exchange of information among the growing
   number of computer users. Calls placed using modems require no
   special telephone company equipment, and users of modems pay the
   phone company for use of the network in the form of a monthly bill.

   In short, a modem call is the same as a voice call and therefore
   should not be subject to any additional regulation.

   Sincerely,
   [your name, address and signature]

It is important that you act now.  The bureaucrats already have it in their
heads that modem users should subsidize the phone company and are now
listening to public comment. Please stand up and make it clear that we will
not stand for any government restriction on the free exchange of
information.

In terms of practical applied physics, we currently know of no
material or combination of materials, which, when in contact and
sliding past one another, are frictionless.  Molecules are bumpy
little bastards, even in low friction combinations like teflon and
polyethylene, or steel and lubricating oil.  Even in low friction
materials, molecules interact with one another, bumping and stripping
electrons and destroying molecular bonds, pulling and wearing away
both materials.  The entire science of bearings is involved in
"getting the friction out" by engineering design (compare replacing a
sleeve or journal with a ball bearing) or by adding lubricants.

I don\'t think there will ever be a frictionless material, unless of
course someone finds a way to make "smooth" molecules, which according
to our physics, both newtonian and relativistic, is impossible.  On
the other hand, who knows what strange physics the future holds?  I
opine, however, that the nature of molecular interaction, (which is
the level at which friction is well explained), will not be subject to
change even as our knowledge of physics expands.  

Even today, there are remarkable low friction materials.  Most of
these materials have significant problems which prevent them from
being generally available for widespread commercial applications.  The
typical problems are strength of the material (bearings are subjected
to some pretty hefty stresses), bonding failure when bonded to a
stronger material, and cost, to name a few.  Given that we have the
technology today to make really low friction materials, albeit
expensively, I would estimate that by, say TL10, most of the problems
we have today will go away.

Why bother with frictionless materials?  The area of mechanical
engineering where you want no friction is in bearing design.  And true
frictionless bearings were invented in the 1970\'s for the european
space program.  <The French Government (through the government
corporation which manufactures the rocket engines for the eureopean
space program) owns the patent rights.>  Each bearing is custom
designed, so they are VERY VERY expensive.  There is no bearing
surface - the components never touch because the rotor is suspended
inside a magnetic field.

The largest frictionless bearing so far was made for a IR gas turbine
at a power plant - the rotor (ie, the turbine shaft) was to the tune
of 10s of tons (I want to say 20, but I\'m pulling figures out of my
memory - I really should go home and look the numbers up, but I
confess I\'m being lazy).  So size is not a limitation.  Also, the
position of the rotor inside the field is actively controlled by an
analog filter (a frightening concept in this modern day of digitized
controls) - the resonance frequencies of the rotor can be filtered out
so the rotor can actually spin at a speed GREATER than its critical.
All of this is possible NOW (life is stranger than fiction...) though
at very large price tag.

>From a traveller perspective, I would say the frictionless bearings
become available at our current TL; the price tag, power consumption,
and physical size fall with increasing TL (the bearing is an
electromagnet - now think about the size required for an electromagnet
to float a 20 ton turbine shaft...).

Is anyone interested enough in frictionless bearings for me to go home
and generate some traveller charts for them?  (I think they\'re rather
esoteric myself...for traveller purposes, I would just go ahead and
assume that I could use them cheaply by, say, TL12.)

I suspect I\'m getting pedantic at this point, so I\'ll wrap this up.

Steve Higginbotham asked, I suspect somewhat incredulously:

Would you believe desperation?

A few years back, I was working at the Naval Research Lab in DC in diamond
thin film coatings.  This technology has a lot of applications in future
technology.

For one, diamond has a very low co-efficient of friction.  Diamond coated
bearings will not only be extremely durable, but have very low friction.
Diamond is also a very good heat conductor.  Therefore cooling these bearings
will be a lot easier.

Durable,
Low friction,
Good Heat conductivity,
Good optical qualities,
Good semiconductor.

Sounds pretty good don\'t it?  Problem is that right now, we can\'t grow single
crystal diamond films.  Not yet, but pretty soon.  They are studying a lotta
techniques to get these things working.  Just before I left I heard about a
new idea that was producing good results.  (They were going after the patent
so I\'m not sure if I can say much.  Ask me in a couple years...)

But basically growing diamond films is very easy.  Polycrystalline films are
dead simple.  You can grow them with an acetylene welding torch.  The trick is
getting the right temperature in the flame and the correct temperature on the
substrate.  You also have to worry about the purity of your acetylene and
oxygen in your welding torch.

If you\'ve got the right conditions, you will grow a diamond coating.  The
rate of growth is currently very slow, but that\'s one of the things they are
working on.   One of they guys at the lab wanted to grow a diamond about a
kilgram in mass to give to Cher (Don\'t ask!)  However, I did a little back of
the envelope calculations and found that it would take 300 years or so to
grow at current rates.  (Cher won\'t be looking so great in 300 years...)

However, even these dirty polycrystalline films could be polished down to a
smooth surface for use in bearings.  Then the problem of adhearance to the
substate comes in.  The polycrystalline lattice has weak points in it and these
can lead to failure.

Other uses of diamond:
Diamond doped with boron makes an excellent semiconductor.  It is much faster,
more durable, and radiation hard than silicon, gallium arsinide, and silicon
carbide.  With the added heat conductivity of diamond it will be a LOT easier
to pack a lotta circuits into a diamond computer chip and your diamond
supercomputer won\'t have to be cooled with liquid nitrogen.

Diamond also has some very nice optical properties.  It is much more
transparant in certain frequency ranges than glass or quartz.  So your TL 13+
x-ray lasers may be using diamond optics for their lenses and mirrors.

At the current rate of R&D, I\'d guess that diamond  thin films,
semiconductors and optics will be available at TL9.  But Diamond computers
will hold off till TL 10.  (They\'ll have to redevelop a lot of circuitry
etching techniques which are currently geared toward silicon)

For those of you who were there and remember, This is what Tweel and \'Vouf
were arguing about (and annoying everyone :-) for weeks in the PBEM.  (I think
that discussion was the spark that demanded that the PBEMCHAT line be set
up! :-)  Diamond films for use in cooling and monotoring Jump drives.  If you
coated a starship with a diamond thin film coating doped with boron, you could
then cool the grid more efficiently, and monitor the grid by etching circuitry
into that film you can install sensors to monitor the grid.

Tweel originally suggested that the grid could be reduced to an evaporated
thin coating of lanathaum and coat that with a thin film of diamond to
protect it.  \'Vouf then quashed that one by bringing up the possibility of
battle damage.  In the end the proposal was to coat the grid with diamond
thereby helping the cooling which would decrease the mass of the needed
lanthanum and thereby decreasing the cost of the drive.  OF course all of this
is arguing about non-existant jump technolgy, but I\'m sure that you get the
point that diamond could be VERY useful for trav technology.

PS.  Catie, *I\'d* like to hear more about the magnetic frictionless bearings.

One thing that you may want to note is that the coefficient of friction 
is a property of two substances sliding on each other, so wood on ice 
has a very different coefficient of friction from wood on sandpaper.

"Frictionless" means no friction. Zero.  I think you\'re thinking of 
smaller and smaller coefficients of friction, and a far more natural way
to list that would be to say the coef. of friction of the slipperiest 
substance known decreases by an order of magnitude with each tech level:
ie.  0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001, etc.

I\'m curious as to why anyone really cares about improvement in 
low-friction substances.  Surely this sort of thing just gets lumped 
into "improved engine efficiency", or some such.

Incidentally, guys, don\'t make the argument based on "free exchange of 
information", because they\'re not trying to restrict what you say. 
They\'re just trying to make you pay more for a piece of equipment that
sits on your desk.

Object because modem users should not subsidize the phone companies.

Quantum mechanics disagrees.

If you count "zero viscosity" as equivalent to "zero friction",
we know of at least two frictionless substances: Helium-4 at 
temperatures below 4 K, and Helium-3 at temperatures below 1.5 K.
(If for some reason you care about the exact temperatures, look them up. 
Don\'t quote me.)  Both substances undergo phase changes to superfluid 
states, and develop some distinctly strange properties. And before 
anyone says that these temperatures are too cold to be useful, remember 
two things: we\'re talking about working in space, where the ambient 
temperature is on this order of magnitude, and that ten years ago, 
it was thought that superconductivity could only occur at these 
temperatures.

Give the (deservedly) anonymous author a no-prize for a clearer
understanding of low-friction technology than toilet
technology.  The principal reason toilets have water in them is
to prevent odors escaping.  Not only is the brown stuff
submerged in water during use but, much more importantly,
Crapper\'s celebrated invention is designed so that there is
always a water barrier between the user and the main sewer
line.  Without this barrier, one\'s home would soon begin to
smell like a sewer.  The flushing action is designed mainly to
carry offensive materials through the barrier.  Consider the
predecessor of the flush toilet, in which a *very* low
coefficient of friction exists between the target material and
the transport on the way to the final disposal destination
:-).  Not something I\'d want in my home.

I think this was "A World Out of Time" by Larry Niven.  An excellent
book, highly recommended.  Try to imagine the earth after a million
years or so, now a satellite of Jupiter.

I remember something similar from "David Starr, Space Ranger", space
opera by Isaac Asimov.  Much of the science is somewhat drechlich,
but he pointed out in several cases that surfaces without surface
tension (probably not actually frictionless) would save water on
Mars, where every drop is precious.
 
Is that what you were thinking of?

No doubt about it! But I imagine if a society is advanced enough
to create a frictionless surface it also has the means to keep
odors under control. Then again, I didn\'t say it was a good idea
only an interesting one! :-)

As to the particular novel, A World Out of Time by Niven and 
David Starr, Space Ranger by Asimov were mentioned. I was thinking
about Childhoods End by Asimov. Now, I\'ll have to search my library
and find it!

Which MegaTraveller game do you have 1 or 2?

MegaTrav 1 has problems in the earlier releases. If you have an early
release write to Paragon for an update. How to tell if you have an
earlier release? Since I don\'t have the game with me it would be just
as easy to call Paragon and find out. [ Really helpful, huh! :-)]

Flying the ship is about as bad as trying to control the combat.
MT2 simplifies both and is more flexible. First off, this may sound
dumb but, make sure you have enough fuel. It\'s easy to forget to
refuel, usually you do it just once then you remember the next time!
I did! Second, each position on the ship controls different functions.
Switching between them is a pain, again it\'s easier in MT2. If you\'re
in the wrong station the other stations keep on doing what they were
told previously. Which is ok most of the time but to land the ship
stop movement in orbit around the planet. Once in orbit select land
and that should do it. 

Skill level of your characters also plays a part. If they are not
high enough it is difficult to control actions. Weapon skills being
a prime example! If you watch your lower level skill characters
shoot the beams fly all over the place. The same goes for piloting
and nav skills. Accuracy at lower levels is really poor.

The stories that Jim Baranski and Bart Massey are talking about sound like
Larry Niven / Jerry Pournelle collaborations.  I think that the friction-
less toilet appears in _Mote In God\'s Eye_, as one of the Brownies\' 
constructions aboard the _MacArthur_.  The story reads a lot like something
out of Classic Traveller, black globes and all.  Sequel due out soon, but
it stands alone.

There is a story about hiding from enemies in a solar system with
some very dangerous planets in one of the "Man-Kzin Wars" books too, which
are usually Niven collaborations with Pournelle and at least one other
author.  It seems that his contract with the publisher for the _Mote_
sequel stipulates that it will be the next Niven/Pournelle book, but
says nothing about three-way collaborations.... :)

Got a question for ya.  Been on my back burner for a while.
Pseudo-biological robots.  How good are they at passing for the real thing?

According to What little we know, TL 15 is minimal for attempting to pass for
human.  To me, that sounds kinda high and lesser levels of deception might be
possible.  For instance:  If someone wanted a pseudo-biological border guard,
how hard would it be for them to pass for a human in that occupation?

I think that it would be relatively easy to build a robot that could pass a
cursory inspection.  The main difficulties would be getting the robot\'s body
language correct.  You might build a motorized manequin, but all the
articulations would be difficult.  Getting the skin to move properly as it is
the muscle simulators move underneath it.  Particularly important (at least in
human models) would be getting the facial muscles right.  It won\'t pass for
human if it smiles like a gargoyle!

Ok, now DGP says that the TL 15 pseudo-bio Aybee from their adventures can pass
as a human with exceptional success.  I haven\'t read all their adventures, but
seems that they managed to fool 98% of those they came in contact with.

Ok, what about a TL 14 attempt at a pseudo-bio?  There is an Aslan Pseudo-Bio
in 101 robots.  They indicate that it does have problems interacting in all
situations, but clearly it CAN pass in some situations.

Go lower.  What about a TL 12 or 13 pseudo-bio?  I would guess that pass in
fewer and fewer cases, but I would guess that it could still manage to pass
as an East German Border Guard or a Yankee State Trooper. :-)
I know a few professors who could very well *BE* TL 11 pseudo-bios!  (YAWN!)

A quick breakdown of Pseudo-Bios in their ability to fool people:
(I tried to come up w/ examples you folks might have seen before)

TL 17+	Virtually indistinguishable  (Think of the replicants from Blade
	Runner)

TL 16	Extremely good in normal circumstances.  (Think new Star Trek:  Lore)

TL 15	Quite good in normal circumstances.  Can fool most people virtually
	all the time.  (Think of the pseudo-bios in Alien(s)).

TL 14	Ok.  Can fool most people, best only under certain circumstances.
	Limited in their ability by their area of experience.  You don\'t wanna
	talk to a robot programmed as a pilot on the topic of music or art
	appreciation.  (Think of the androids in the old Star Trek:  I Mudd)
	("I am not programmed to respond in that area...")

TL 13	Can fool people only in the proper circumstances.  Otherwise almost
	immediately distinguishable as a robot.  (Think Data from the new
	Star Trek)  If you get them off the subject of their own expertise,
	they are hopeless.  The movement is kinda stiff.  Facial expression
	Not quite up to snuff.

TL 12	Can fool people only if the robot shows no emotion.  Has all the acting
	ability of Arnold Shwartzeneger.  Has virtually no knowlege outside of
	their application programs.  Facial expression:  must maintain a
	poker face.  Movement more stiff.  (Terminator, Gunslinger from
	Westworld)

TL 11	Can fool people only if it stands still.  Walk is awkward - looks
	funny.  (Think Lurch from the Addams Family)

TL 10	No better than a contoured robot.

How \'bout the effects of the TL can vary dependant upon who is interacting
with the robot.  Thus a human dealing with an Aslan pseudo-bio would have more
difficulty figuring it out than the same human with a human pseudo-bio.  Say
a robot would be effectively one or two tech levels higher in it\'s ability to
fool sophonts.  Thus you could have a Aslan pseudo-bio at tech 14 deceive
humans as well as a TL 15 human configured bot.  (Or maybe a TL 12 Hiver bot!)
(Who knows?  Maybe the Hiver you\'ve been dealing with is a robot.  Then again,
Maybe *ALL* The Hivers are robots...  Who\'d notice the difference?  Who\'d
care?)

Anybody got any ideas on this?  I\'m real curious.

Mott Given asks:
:  1) I am having a hard time being able to control my spaceship to land it on 
:  a world.

What always worked out for me was to:
  find the world I wanted to land on
  head toward it at about 10 - 15 speed units
  slam on the breaks when I was really close.
  
If I remember, the slam on the brakes routine was a spacebar, or mouse
click in the center box of the velocity/attitude control thingy.  It took
me a few days to get the hang of it.  Then it was easy.


:  I haven\'t found the instruction manual very helpful. 

So what else is new?  If they\'d pay me, I\'d write \'em a good one.  :=)

:  I wind up running out of fuel before I can land anywhere.  Sometimes 
:  I can get close to a world, but cannot land on it.  I even find it 
:  difficult to navigate well enough to get close to a world.  

The trick is to slow down *rapidly* when you\'re near a planet.  The 
only effective way I ever found is described above.  Trying retro-
thrust is just too slow.  If you can get stopped, or at least crawlingly 
slow, the starport will just capture you.

Navigating is another one of those things I sorta dislike.  You have to
have a player with Pilot-2.  For the first month or two I played, I 
resorted to using strictly vertical and strictly horizontal movements.
Much easier to control.  When you leave hyperspace, immediately stop.
Then look at the relative planet locations, compare that with the planet
(star system) maps in the book, and take a straight vertical/straight
horizontal route to the planet you want.

Hope that helps.

  Well, Gothcon XVI is over, and I\'ve had two days to sleep on, so I\'m

  The traveller activities this year was rather limited, just one adventure
about the misfortunes of a broke crew of a type-S. Compared to last year,
the auction was a desert: All traveller things for sale was an "Azhanti"

The PBEM is a strange undertaking, where about 40 current and former TML

Traveller. The game, originally run by Richard Johnson, is now
co-refereed by our own Mark Cook and metlay. While player slots in the
game are limited, listener slots are always open. For more answers to
specific questions, please write pbemref@engrg.uwo.ca, which is a mail

    'body' => 'Howdy,

Richard asks about cyborgs and how do ya tell them from normal people or
robots.

Well, if I remember right, there was an old medical technology TL chart in
The old DGP Grand Census.  It may be reprinted in the World builder\'s handbook.
It said (from memory) that at TL 12, \'advanced prosthetics\' were available.
To my mind that means either:

A) prosthetic limbs that are indestinguishable to most observation.

	or

B) advanced prosthetic organs which are capable of replacing critical internal
organs.  I\'d guess that a prosthetic eye would be about TL 12.  It probably
won\'t look much like a normal eye, but at TL 13 a robotic eye would be
indestinguishable from a normal one.

Of course all these will be immediately detectable by a densiometer scan.

But I also remember that at TL 9 limb regeneration is possible, and at TL 12
they talk about regeneration of complex things like eyes.  So, to be frank,
I\'m not sure why the question of cyborgs come up.  If you want to have a new
limb, you can grow it just as easily as have one built for you.  There will be
people who want cybernetic stuff built into them, but that would be rather
more rare than the guy who lost an arm and wants it back.

Now, the cyborgs would then be cyborgs by CHOICE.  And depending on how
obvious the individual wants it to be, above TL 12 you\'ll need a densiometer
to pick them out.  Even at TL 12, if the addition is small and carefully kept
to be the same density as surrounding tissue, an implant might be VERY hard
to detect.  X-Ray?  Build it out of plastic.

To quote an ancient chinese saying "Where there are electronic counter
measures, there are electronic counter counter measures."  If you want your
implant hidden, you can make it hidden.  Then it would take a more advanced
sensor scan to pick it up.  Such scans probably exist, but they are not
normally in use.

It\'s like trying to hide a body pistol.  The higher the TL pistol, the higher
the TL sensors it\'s designed to fool. :-)

As to the question:  Can a cyborg pass for a robot?  Well, if he was designed
to do so, sure.  But who would wanna be designed that way?  To fool a
densiometer scan your insides would have to look like the insides of a robot.
That means massive replacement of your organs with cybergear.  Also, I\'d bet
your brain and it\'s massive support equipment will show up on a densiometer
scan.  I\'m not really sure how to address the question I\'m afraid.  Under what
circumstances would a cyborg wanna pass for a robot?
	----
Back to Pseudo-Bios.
I know zip about software programming.  Pascal and Basic are my limits.  I
can\'t address the difficulties of Programming these babies.  I\'d get jumped
real quick by the real computer jocks out there.  But, I\'d bet that at
differing tech levels, software engineers could handle the task with equal
ability, the main trouble is getting the hardware in shape to where a good
enough program can be run.

Quick look at brain design:
The education of a robot is effectively limited to how many storage units can
be stuffed in the robot.  Thus we can assume that given unlimited cash we can
build it to any education level we want.

Brain intelligence is limited though.  At TL 8 the max intelligence is
negative 3.  But at TL 9 we get parallel CPU components and the max
intelligence is then limited to Tech level minus 3.  Thus:
TL	Intelligence
9	6
10	7  etc. etc.

At TL 12 you can run Low Autonomous Programming and the cost of an intelligent
brain goes down.

So, I think that even a TL 9 brain is up to the task of fooling a person into
thinking it is an organic being under LIMITED circumstances.  (Hmm, how many
TMLers out there have actually met in the flesh... hmmmmmm? |->

So the problem is not so much the brain hardware, nor the software really.
But getting both to the point where the robot can act organic under more and
more circumstances.  Trying to fill in the gaps in the robot\'s conversation
that would not be there in a human.  Most humans have some sort of opinion on
every topic you can imagine (look at me and my big mouth!).  But if a robot
is mainly programmed for something like flying what happens when the question
of music comes up?  Then of course you could program it to be reticent on such
topics, but that\'s a cop out.  It is also a tactic that could be explioted.
(Blade Runner:  "Tell me about your mother...")

What do the software jocks say?  James?  Mark?  Richard?

Additionally, if I know I am able to (and can afford to) become "human"
again by regeneration - why not become mostly robot to experience or 
perform something of which I\'m otherwise incapable?  Visit Jupiter for
instance.

Well that gets us to, .. why not just do it virtually and let an automaton
take all the risks?  If we can build an automaton that\'s capable of holding
my awareness well enough without being sentient in and of itself...

	no, it doesn\'t use any object-oriented programming. What it does
have however, are several well made databases which stores items/rooms,
etc etc. They learned how to do it by trials & errors, not to mention
experience.. I don\'t think there is any book on how to program this
type of games.

The two types of TL are totally unrelated to each other.  If you don\'t do
MT, then explanations would be a waste of time.  Suffice it to say that
MT has a MUCH higher TL than 2300AD, except for the stutterwarp, which is
not part of MT, and which is a much better drive than MT\'s Jumpdrive.

Recently GDW came up with "Hard Times", which was an excuse to lower the TL
of the Imperium significantly.  In it they assumed that if civilization 
started to crumble, that 4000 year old technologies would be easier to
maintain than modern ones (ie that a world that has used grav exclusively
for 4000 years would find it easier to build new chemical rockets than to
build new grav generators).  So MT introduced chemical rockets for the poor
locals to use (and for the PCs to sneer at).

Talk is cheap, here\'s my two cents worth.

When it comes to "true" AI, existing programming models are insufficient
to the task. The challenge to explicit programming becomes far too
great, requiring the AIT to auto-program itself a result of life
experiences. AIs are likely to have a very different set of initial
experiences than humans, and would take a large amount of interaction to
recognize and categorize human interaction and mimic it. Of course, once
such a pattern is established in one piece of hardware, the
implementation can be cloned, with fairly convincing results.

I think part of the problem of choosing cyberware over regeneration could
be a simple matter of time.  In order to have a properly \'designed\'
regenerative part, whould suggest the involvement of sample DNA.  After a
sample is taken, then the limb or organ is grown from \'scratch\', which
would take some time.  While various biochemical accelerators could be
used to hasten the process, I think there would still be required, a
significant amount of time to grow the limb.

Then it has to be attached to your body, the chance of freak rejection
has to be eliminated, any shock to the body from re-attaching a significant
addition (in terms of blood supply, nervous system reactivation, etc),
and THEN thelong process of regaining meaningful use from the new part
begins, also moderately lengthy.

This is all wonderful, if you have the time and money.

But for the working Joe on a working Joe\'s wage, who needs a new arm pronto
or else he loses his ability to support himself, a prosthetic is a more
suitable answer.

Well, it would certainly be a matter of taste, but there is no end of
example amongst humanity, of people who just LOVE to alter there
appearance with things as simple as makeup, to bones, rivets, zippers,
pins and assorted other \'heavy metal\'.  So I\'m sure cybernetic eyes are
probably a trendy item somewhere, as would be a pump action shotgun
mounted in an artificial limb, if you happen to be an enforced for some
cheap mob in the gritty part of town \'Just About Anywhere\'.

Of course this doesn\'t become muchof a concern for many Trav Characters,
who are mostoften taken from the ranks of the elite armed forces or
similar services.  But I can certainly see many opportunities for
deep cover Scouts, serving as spies, where it would be of advantage to
have a body on the borderline...IE, one that could alternately pass as
Biological or Cybernetic, depending on the circumstances.

In a room full of robots, if the baddies are out to get you, you sure as
hell wanna match in with the rest of the \'bots!

I agree!  It\'s my feeling that those proponents of an intelligent machine
are too wrapped up in making it appear EXACTLY like a human.  Why not let
mechanical engineers solve the problem of an ambulatory machine with senses
that work at a level, good for simulating human senses first.

Once the little sucker can move around, then start programming.  It seems
to me that if you abandone the idea of trying to duplicate how human body
structure works, in a machine, then you can go on to invent a new series of
joints that are strong and flexible.  When that happens, THEN let\'s see
how we can apply these new dynamic joints to a human shaped bot.

After that, it should be a piece of cake!  [Hahahahahaha]

Magnetic Bearings (this might get a bit pedantic, so you may just
		   want to skim...we techno-weenies can to be a bit
		   much at times...)

Since you (well, one of you) asked, here is some more info on magnetic
bearings which are currently available.  The government owned
corporation in France which owns the rights to magnetic bearings is Le
Socie\'te\' Europe\'enne de Propusion (SEP).  A partnership between SEP
and SKF (the big Swedish bearing company) called Le Socie\'te\' de
Me\'canique Magne\'tique (S2M) manufactures the mag bearings for the
european market.  A partnership between S2M and Kollmorgen Corp (yes,
the same people who make periscopes) called Magnetic Bearing Inc (MBI)
manufactures mag bearings for the North American market.  <I used to
work for Kollmorgen, just in case anyone was wondering where my info
was coming from...>

I\'ve just dug through too many pages of technical manuals (in English
and French, and boy is my French ever rusty!!!) on mag bearings, and
have reduced a brain-frying amount of mechanical engineering down into
some simple statements and statistics.

A mag bearing is like a funky cross between an induction motor, an
eletromagnet and a PID controller.  The idea is to pick up a rotor in
a magnetic field.  No rotor is rigid really - even big shafts have
resonance modes, and bouncing modes, and bending modes...  If you\'ve
done any engineering mechanics, you\'re familiar with this sort of
behavior (and if you\'re not familiar, take my word for it please, or
curl up with your favorite physics book, followed by Fung or Shanes or
Den Hartog...)  So considering that the rotor wants to bend and bounce
and expand and flex and misbehave in general, the magnetic bearings
act on the rotor, pushing and pulling it with magnetic force to keep
it in a desired position.  The control on the mag flux is achieved
with an active ANALOG PID controller.  A digital controller is
apparently too slow, since the variable that\'s measured and acted on
to control the flux is current and there\'s a SQUARE relationship
between current and flux.  The current changes too fast for any
digital sampler to deal with - the aliasing problems are unreal!  So
the controller is a good old fashioned analog filter...awesome,
state-of-the-art 1930\'s technology...

In terms of force and power, it takes 8000 watts to get a bearing
force of 5 tons (english units) per bearing quadrant.  This means to
elevate and control a 20 ton shaft, you need 8000 x 5 watts ( four
radial bearing units and one thrust bearing) = 40000 watts.  All
things considered, in terms of power consumption, that\'s pretty cheap.
That\'s about the same amount of power as running 60 microwave ovens at
full power simultaneously...  Mind you, a set of the really big mag
bearings are to the tune of a million bucks american...  The RPMs
available to big shafts with mag bearings are in the low single
thousands (which may seem high to you mechanical types, but remember
that mag bearings allow a shaft to survive the passage through the
critical - the only limitation on the shaft rotation is the strength
of the material when subjected to centrifugal forces).

The itsy bitsy mag bearings, for specialty items like turbomolecular
pumps, small cryogenic compressors, neutron choppers (don\'t ask me
what it is - I\'m just quoting some S2M literature here) use up only a
little power - 120 watts per bearing quadrant for shafts less than a
kilo, But the RPMs are in the 100,000s!  A set of little mag bearings
is cheap - in the tens of thousands range of dollars.

(So you\'re probably all thinking that that\'s the last time you
encourage me to expound on something...  Sorry if I got pedantic - I
suffer from nerd attacks every now and then...  I can usually tell
when I\'m in the middle of an excessive nerd attack at my weekly
traveller game, since Jim the GM and everyone else is giving that long
suffering look again...  Life is so hard for us nerds...  I shoulda
listened to my Mom and gone to music school...)

Reagarding cybernetics, Scott posted:

> Well, if I remember right, there was an old medical technology TL 
> chart in The old DGP Grand Census.  

The old Travellers\' Digests issues 12, 13, and 14 have a three part
article called "Body Parts" I cannot remember seeing any other rules
on the subject (though if someone knows of some, please point me to
them).  I\'ve used these rules, and can say honestly, they were
difficult to decipher; but once my GM and I had figured out how to use
them, we came to the conclusion that these rules are workable though
they contain what we consider to be many unreasonable constraints,
principally in cost and in functionality.

> Now, the cyborgs would then be cyborgs by CHOICE. 

No, not necessarily (my opinion...).  Using the Digest article
mentioned above, you have to take a roll to suceed at getting your
regrown or cloned body part.  Sucess is not guarenteed, even at TL15.

We decided that there are probably good circumstances under which a
character will fail at regrowing or cloning new body parts.  Radiation
damage is one such circumstance, a degenerative neurological condition
would be another.  Uncooperative dice and a hard-nosed GM are
another...

Then there are the price considerations: prosthetics are cheap,
regrowns are next in price, bionics are more expensive, and cloned
parts are most expensive.  Not every portside bum is going to be able
to foot the bill for regrowns or bionics.  Only the very rich can
afford cloned parts.  You also have to find a doctor with the right
skills to carry out the appropriate procedure, and you must have the
time to go through the surgery and therapy.

I have a character currently in play who got shot up too many times
during character generation.  We used the info in Digest 13 to see
what sorts of parts my character got as replacements.  I\'ve been
running this character for a half a year now, and there are
improvements I would make to the rules presented in Digests 12, 13,
and 14.

First, the psychological impact of improved mechanical body parts is
not addressed well in the Digest article.  I would add a variety of
responses available to a character upon receiving artificial parts,
though I don\'t think I would include the "cyberpsycosis" from the
Cyberpunk games.  That sort of "bad attitude" is what makes the
cyberpunk games cyberpunk, and including it into Traveller is counter
to the flavor of the game as I\'ve always played it.  If I wanted to
cyber-out, I\'d go play cyberpunk, ok?  For adjustment problems, I
would include the self-esteem degradation mentioned in the article,
plus various stress related conditions from mild anxeity through
catatonia (as an extreme reaction to not being able to cope).  I\'d
also include some required furtive behavior, since there are parts of
space where people with artificial parts aren\'t welcome.  Remember, if
you look at the MT literature, cyborgs are property, not people in
Margret\'s corner of the universe...  And remember the SSMM?  I
wouldn\'t want to be standed on old Terra with too many prostetics
attached...

I would include an explaination for why there is a gap between
prostetics and bionics.  To my mind, there should be no gap, or an
obvious technological reason for the difference.  Working within the
rules, I have justified the difference by there being two different
technologies for replicating motion, and the bionic one must be more
compact and more efficient - how else to you account for the improved
strength and agility in the same volume?  But using that philosophy
has led me to the question of why aren\'t all pseudobio limbs of the
bionic variety.  If I were writting the rules, that\'s what I\'d do:
pseudobios must be of the bionic variety since the whole concept of
pseudobio presupposes customization.

I would also allow more than one gadget per limb, but I don\'t think
I\'d allow a person to become a walking weapons platform...buying
battledress makes much more sense to me.  Myself, I\'d much rather have
a date with a cyborg that looked like a person instead walking missile
rack, \'ya know...  

I confess I have swiped some of the gadgets from Cyberpunk for my
character.  I thought the cyberpunk pop-up flashlight hidden under a
fingernail was fun, so my character has one...  She is a rather
practical kinda gal after all.  I rejected the entire concept of
jacking in and out of a vast net-space - there are some old classic
traveller rules regarding human/computer interfacing and they always
seemed reasonable to me.  The interface is absurdly expensive
(probably articificially so), and also the withdrawal symptoms after
being disconnected were logical to me.  Traveller, after all, is about
good \'ol fashioned nuts\'n\'bolts space-hopping...if I wanted to go do
netrunning, I\'d go play cyberpunk, ok?

I never thought that I\'d ever consider writing Traveller oriented
cyborg rules, since I too was waiting around for the DGP volume on
Robots and Cyborgs...  Now I keep hearing that DGP has dropped MT
altogether.  Is this really true?  All of us in my traveller group
would like to know more about the details (we\'ve been lurking on this
list only since the beginning of March).

It scares me, in a way. Half a dozen myths are floating through my head, and I\'m
sitting on the pointy end of all of them.  Opening Pandora\'s Box, stealing fire
from the Gods...I\'ve done it and now I have to figure out what I\'ve done.  I\'m 
reminded disturbingly of Victor Frankenstein.

And the other half of the fear is for Kip: what kind of place can he have in 
this world? There\'s no precedent. I\'ll do everything I can for him, and he\'ll 
still be alone in a way no human has ever been.

- ----





Welcome to the Frankenstein Project.  This will be a summer pbem, since I 
believe the Official TML MegaPBeM will be closing down for the summer, and I 
have the time to do stuff now.  Plus I have this idea I have to do SOMETHING 
with.


GAME SETTING

The game will be set in the universe of 2300AD.  The characters are making the 
first serious shot at creating an artificial intelligence.

The project is being conducted in a small spacehab--a converted geological 
survey outpost--because repeated experience has shown that such projects do best
in isolated incubation, because Zassenbach-Liouville wants to keep the project 
secret, and because they don\'t want to chance letting something get loose that 
they aren\'t prepared to deal with.  The characters will be the only ones aboard 
the hab.


TECHNICAL SPECS

I\'m going to try to steal all the best parts of the TML pbem, so this game will 
be fairly freeform as well, with all the significant characters run by players. 
(Excepting Kip. Kip is MINE.)  I am going to set an absolute limit of 12 
players--I\'m guessing that\'s enough to get a fairly dynamic game going, without 
overloading the ref any more than necessary.

I\'m going to try to compile regular turns, which hopefully can be smaller and 
more frequent than the TML pbem.

The game is set in 2300AD, but no knowledge of the game system will be required.


CHARACTERS

I\'m going to warn you all about this now.  As a ref I\'m going to be pretty 
strict about what kinds of characters I\'m going to allow in--some of you will 
have fairly narrowly-defined roles to fill.  My goal is to get a moderately 
coherent game set up from the beginning, to avoid the problems later.  Once the 
game is started, though, I\'ll let you do your thing.

The following positions will be filled. (While I have set names and genders for 
many of these characters, such details are of course negotiable.)

o  Dr. Kristophe Hunt-Thomas, Project Director.  
	One of the most brilliant scientists of his generation.  Holds 
	doctorates in computer science (intelligence systems), and 
	developmental psychology.  Driving force behind the project.

o  Julia Toronaga, Project Administrator.
	Responsible for Zassenbach-Liouville\'s interests; link between project
	and corporation.

Project Scientists (alphabetical order)

o  Dr. Karl Bach, Psychologist (Hab Medic)
o  Dr. Raisa Kolmov, Software
o  Dr. Bellin Steiner, Robotics/Manipulator systems
o  Dr. Tor Wilson, Chip development/Software

Technicians

o  Tally Killebrae, Photonics
o  Kirby Wallace, Robotics/Machinist

Station Staff

o  Engineer (Station maintenance)
o  Assistant Engineer
o  Hydroponics/Life Systems Tech
o  Security Officer

The project scientists and technicians were chosen from among the best 
available.  Note also that the less glamourous station staff could prove 
tremendously important in the adventure if things don\'t go well.


APPLICATIONS

In principle, all you need to do is send me a note saying you\'re interested.  
However, if I get more than twelve expressions of interest, I\'ll be trying to 
select the best players, rather than just the quickest on the <r> key.  If I 
haven\'t seen your work in the TML PBeM (or if you\'re Aslan or Ring-natives that 
I haven\'t seen much of), samples of your best writing are encouraged.

Also, many of the characters are research scientists, and I would hope their 
players will be able to write thoughtfully on the subject.  If you want one of 
those roles, try to show you have something to say.  This is SF, after all.


DEADLINE

If you\'re interested, I want to know about it by FRIDAY, MAY 1, 1992. I will be 
out of town for much of the time between now and then, so don\'t be concerned if 
I\'m not replying to your messages.


DISCLAIMER

The fact that I\'m offering to start up a pbem is clear proof of my insanity, so 
don\'t say I didn\'t warn you.

Funny you should mention 2300... it\'s been sort of the thing I\'ve been
fiddling with the most lately.  After finals are over, I should have time
to send in my collection of 2300 ship designs (and sc template), as well
as the "2301 Star Cruiser" supplement I\'ve been working on.  Basically,
it consists of the following changes to 2300 Star Cruiser:

  1. The optional damage multiplier rule from _Invasion_ is *not*
     optional.  Actually, we\'ve been playing it that way all along;
     I was surprised to see it presented as an optional rule.  I 
     thought that they had just made an error in the original rules,
     since the Martel is supposed to have an armor factor of 10....

  2. The speed of light is enforced.  It takes 2 seconds for a signal to
     travel one hex, and another 2 seconds per hex for a reply.  Distant
     ships appear to be in the hexes they occupied at times in the past,
     this is enforced by a referee or with plotting.  Negative modifiers
     apply to "to hit" chances based on how old the information used in
     firing is.  The negative modifiers are reduced somewhat by remote
     operator skill, which now works somewhat differently.

  3. Optics, scanners, and fire control systems may be used as contigency
     search sensors.  They have an active or passive sensor value of 0,
     always require a roll to detect, may only attempt to detect targets
     already detected by some other friendly unit, and may only detect
     or maintain detection on one target each.  This was added to prevent
     remote objects with no sensors (i.e. the Ritage-2) from becoming 
     worthless due to the speed of light rule.

  4. Remote objects may be programmed (by writing a plot), and can follow
     simple programs without tying up a communicator channel.  Remote 
     objects with sensors may be programmed to do things relative to 
     sensor contacts that they are maintaining (i.e. "close with target 
     1").  Attacks made without a human operator suffer the usual penalty.
     When a remote object runs off the end of its plot, it goes to all stop.

  5. Computer hits on human ships are localized.  When a computer critical
     is rolled, roll on the damage table again, treating hull as critical,
     damage control as surface fixture, and continuing as power plant.  The
     resulting system becomes inoperable until the hit is repaired; if the
     second roll is computer, it acts like an old computer hit.  Kafer ships
     have centralized data processing facilities, and use the old rule.

  6. Speed is a function of local gravitation.  A formula is given for
     "tunnel length" as a function of the local gravitational field;
     The tunnel length factor varies from 1 in the maximum gravity in
     which stutterwarp operation is possible to (365*30) in interstellar
     space; it\'s generally about 2 or so in the life zones of main
     sequence stars.  Negative modifiers apply when shooting at ships
     moving at very high speeds.

  7. Long range detection is defined.  Rules are presented for determining
     when a ship is aware that *something* is out there, and maximum ranges
     are given for detecting ships that illuminate their active sensors.

  8. Rules for nuclear weapons are presented.  They are only useful against
     ships in orbit or at "all stop", or ships with low warp efficiencies
     in gravitational fields with low tunneling lengths.

>Also... could someone explain me what the TL\'s stand for. In particuraly
>what\'s Megatraveller TL and 2300ad TL (begining of star exploration, Stutter

MT and 2300 are not the same universe.  This used to be somewhat more 
confusing when the game was marketed as Traveller:2300....

>(are gravitics range sensitive????)

Yes, which is why there are thrusters.

Now, a question: I have the old Traveller:2300 rules.  What\'s different
(other than the fix to the way armor works presented in the Kafer modules)
about 2300AD?  Are there any substantive changes to the game, or did 
they just clean up the *atrocious* way they organized the Traveller:2300
rulebooks?

I have a few queries about (well starship combat I guess), 

1) It seems that the chance to use passive scanners is equal to use
active scanners . Whats the point of this if the active scanners give your
position away ???? . Why not simply increase the chance to use passives
by one level . 

2) Starship movement ???? The book says manuever drive affects the spend at 
which a vessel can move . ie moving at speed 5, a manuever 3 can either
slow down to 2, or speed up to 8 . Okay thast clear, but how did a manuever
ship get up to speed 5 anyway (The book doesnt mention anythin about constant
acceleration (Well I couldnt find it)) . 

3) Agility or Pilot . Thats a bit harsjh, I allow the pilots to add their
skill to the agility . (I mean han solo, his ship had an agility of at least
5, and he himself a pilot skill of at least 5 also) . If you look at it this
way, 2 fighters have agl 6 each, this means they are perfectly matched,
skill really doesnt come into it (unless they are at level 7) . But I also
let the pilot add his skill to the chance to hit . This simulates a pilot
attempting to out manuver the other and place his vessel in a better 
firing position . 

4) Computer or Gunnery . Again a bit harsh, considering all the big naval 
vessels carry gunners (I mean some of these ships have computers - 9), I
again, let the gunner add his skill to the computer rank . 

5) I had a player come up to a disabled corsair in a gig, armed with a 
laser turret, fire point blank rank at the vessels bridge, well I said 
the shot totally wasted it, what are other people views . 

6) Also the same pilot attempted to shoot a G-Carrier escaping from the 
vessel . What are the rules for starship vs vehicle ?????

Someone was I believe going to totally refine the system for 30 second
turns, in 15 km squares .......... I was wondering if they have
a finished copy (or notes) could they please email it to me ???? (That is
if it is no bother .....)

7) Oh yeah, With ranges, do you subtract the number of hexes away craft are
for the range DM\'s ?????

8) Any idea what the rewards are for taking out a corsair (inhabited system)
, I said 250,000 Cr (Was it too much, too little) ????

9) Finally In starship combat, A fuel leak, is it only 1 Ton, once, one
a round, and does this affect ships performance (jumping, manuevering) etc

I Think thats about it ........

Please any comments at all (no matter how big or how small), please
either email (or post) .

Differences between Traveller:2300 and 2300AD...
 
Hmmm...
 
More information about the aliens.  All the little changes made during
the Modules published between one and the other (which is mostly
trivial).  Addition of rules for skill improvement.  Re-arrangement
into a rational rules-set.  Task level changes: Simple from 3+ to 2+.
Routine from 7+ to 6+, and so on...  Characteristic mods to tasks are
now characteristic divided by 4 (drop fractions), instead of 5 (drop
fractions.
 
I guess that sums it up...

	While some will find this system abusive, I don\'t see any problems 
with it. BTW, the _Millenium Falcon_ isn\'t that maneuverable itself -- it
probably wouldn\'t be higher than agility 2-3. It\'s main drive advantage is
that it is very fast in hyperspace -- twice as fast as other ships. (I have
Star Wars: the RPG). While in \'real\' space combat, the distances and times
involved would most likely make the machine more important than the pilot, but
that is hardly exciting for PCs. I prefer to run my space combats more \'Star
Warsish\' -- not very realistic, but its pretty fun

>4) Computer or Gunnery . Again a bit harsh, considering all the big naval

	Makes sense. See above.

	If \'wasted\' means \'destroyed completely\', then no, I would say the
result was a bit extreme. Missile turret, yes; laser turret, no.

Tech levels are a mechanic from Megatraveller, which incorporates many 
societies at all levels of sophistication. Well, ok, not ALL, but you 
get the idea.

2300 can\'t be easily rated, because it occupies a different universe, 
with different mechanics.  No gravitics, different aliens, and in particular, 
a completely different mumbo-box that gets you from one star system to the 
next. (And IMHO, a much more interesting one.)

This varies strongly based on what the ref will let you get away with.
The cybernetic guidance systems that Richard tacitly approved for the
weapons \'Vouf uses in the PBEM were scaled down by a huge amount when
Mark and I took over. 

> BTW To the person who is (or was?) playing \'Vouf in the PBEM, 
> do you have any stats for thos cyber gloves of his ?????

I couldn\'t run them if I didn\'t. The gloves themselves, as run in
the PBEM, are one-of-a-kind works of art, and require no particular
rules underpinning. Mark relies on me not to go any further overboard
with them than I have already, and I should point out that they carry
strong negative points as well-- until recently, \'Vouf was physically
dependent on the gloves, and the rest of the party can only guess at
the psychological love/hate relationship he has with them even now....

Rob Dean and I have toyed with putting together a rules system for them
for publication in CHALLENGE, and that has (along with my article on 
nonlethal weapons cowritten with Hans Rancke-Madsen) stalled due to my
work commitments. I do hope to finish both eventually, with their help
and that of Mark Cook, who has also consulted with me on these matters.

traveller universe full of guns, starships, intrigue etc.  I think the answer
to THAT one is obvious.

If on the other hand, the robot is sufficiently sophisticated to WANT anything,
It is above the common tech levels of traveller.  Artificial Intelligence with
wants/needs/desires is tech level Seventeen.  Not a common problem to deal
with.

As to the question of civil rights, It would completely depend on the local
culture I\'m afraid.  In the Solomani rim, forget it!  What I\'m after is more
a role playing example for robots of differing tech levels.  After all, a
player could choose to play his TL 21 artificial intelligent pseudo-bio robot
as a very wooden version of Mr. Data, and another player might choose to play
his TL 12 pseudo-bio robot as a perfectly normal human being.  How do you know
what to act like?

}Well that gets us to, .. why not just do it virtually and let an automaton
}take all the risks?  If we can build an automaton that\'s capable of holding
}my awareness well enough without being sentient in and of itself...

Jacking into a system, I have always thought of as TL-13 technology.  There
are rules for doing it @ TL15, but that was for a specific implant that was
highly mobile and you could access a computer remotely.  I would imagine that
TL 13 would allow you to control a robot-body from a specially designed
console.  Ok, so the controlled body won\'t be sentient, but you could pick up
the sensations from it easily enough.  Of course at TL 13 that would require
that you have a bunch of stuff installed into your head that you mightn\'t want
there, it might be dangerous, but it might be possible.  I seem to remember
reading a story a long time ago about exploring Jupiter, not from a robot body,
but a genetically engineered body.  It was using a radio link bettween the
operator in a satellite and the body on the \'surface\'.  (Yeah it was an old
story when Jupiter still had a \'Surface\'.)

As to Cyborg stuff:
Regrown/cloned/prosthetic/bionic
I would imagine that most insurance would cover the regrowing of limbs.  If it
is the cheapest option, I\'d guess it would be workable.  After all, most
insurance has clauses about loss of limbs included in life insurance, and most
companies provide employees w/ such insurance now.  But for the cases of
people who can\'t get regrown through wierdness and die rolls, then the
insurance would have to try to replace the limb somehow.  Prosthetic or
whatever.  The ones who will be outta luck are those w/out insurance or those
who get hit by those without insurance.  I seem to remember my life insurance
has a lot of money riding on my arms, legs, eyes and ears.

But, I don\'t see prosthetics being all that easier to have than bionics,
clones, regrowns or whatever.  After all, as it is now, Prosthetic limbs ARE
custom made.  After all, how many people have their limbs severed in exactly
the same way?  It\'s not like a shoe store!
	"Hey Bob?  Looks like this guy\'s gonna need a size six left arm...
Check in the back ok?"

As for cyber/prosthetic psychosis, Well, how many of the handicapped go through
psychosis when they are fitted with an artificial leg now?  I\'m afraid I
haven\'t met many of people who are missing limbs, but they\'re pretty normal.
(except that they actually LIKE the new Star Trek! :-P )

And with the option of regrown, I don\'t see where the army of cyborgs we\'ve
been hearing about lately is coming from.  How many people out there are gonna
have artificial parts?  My guess is not many  (apart from the odd cultures and
botched medical cases.)  Wouldn\'t it be easier to get a TL9 regrown arm than
a TL 12 bionic arm?

    'body' => 'When I was wondering through my collection of archive material (The stuff
I managed to get before my uni restricted out of campus FTP and Telnet .)
I saw a for posts from people talking about the high cost of free traders
and how they are not economically viable . I am not sure about the outcome 
of these discussions but here are some ideas I was mussing about with .....

1) Starship Commerce can really be viable by large corporations . Those
are the only people whop can really afford starships and to keep them up . 
This is not a new idea, in fact I guess fairly standard . But what of the
poor honest free trader . Well in order to explain the existance of free
traders, you must realize they are the exception not the rule . 

Most starship travel and cargo hauling would be undertaken by corporations . 
They could offer guaranteed services, large tax rebates could ensure that 
the vessels were in top condition, they have a high access to security etc . 

I mean as a small time business who had to transport your precious commod-
ities who would you trust ? The cleaming Tukera lines or some battered
old free trader run by captain ahab who has a wooden leg . 

So how do free traders fit into it . Well yes they are rare, they pick up
the more unprofitable cargos or run the speculative markets, or get the
smaller, luctrative cargos . 

Back to the old character generation, a merchant character gets his hands 
on a starship (Including most of the time the coorporation captains) . But
this is for the characters, not for the general populace . The average 
coorporation captain will retire to a life of ease when he leaves the 
merchant service . The reason why players get starships is becuase the
whole point of the game is adventure on the "High Seas" . It would be
rare for an ex corp captian to buy a vessel, and this rare captain would 
be a player . (I mean whats the point in generating a merchant captain to
go and live a life of ease straight afterwards : Ref "What does your
character do ?", Player "Oh I dunno, hang around the jukuzzi") . 

Where do these players get the starships from ???? Well for coorporation
captains thats easy . The average coorporation has to update its 
equipment regualry, this makes good business sense . What does the corp
do with this mothballed freighter, sells it to one of its former employees
(It would not be scared of compedition from its former employee cause the
new owner simply just would not matter (His vessel is very "small fry")) .

Free Traders get their vessels from say a fellow free trader whose retiring,
a bankrupt orgainization, etc . 

The payments are large for paying of a vessel agreed, BUT those people
want to be merhants they didnt get talked into it . The corp captains
could be in it because they want to be independant . 

The intestellar markets are geared up (So I think) for corporations
running the space lanes . The free traders are the independants struggling
to make a living off the "crumbs" the bigger fish dont worry about . But
the intestellar markets can keep a free trader (providing he makes the right
decisions (Sorry for the "He" all the time, its to save effort, not cause
I\'m sexist)) above water, or very wealthy . 

The bank repayments are large on a free trader (About 175,000/Month),
but remember banks, as they are today, are geared up to make their money
off the big companies . Compare interest rates today, something like 13%
for the average small business, and 20% for the corp) . A bank lending
money to an independant is risking it . Space travel is hazardous, money
consuming, and stressful . There is a very good chance they will not see
their money again . Consequently the large interest rates, high repayments .
(I mean theres none of this just having to pay the interest each year) . 

Why become a free trader . Throughout history people admire the underdog, 
and people want independance . Having to rely on others or work for others
is not as good as relying on yourself, or working for yourself . 

The Free Traders are a very hardy and select breed . There is no grey areas
in the free traders, you either survive or you dont, those who do, 
successfully prosper in the dog eat dog enviroment of merchantile space . 
These people are reveared, admired . They have adventures beyond comparison
(well to the average planet bound factory worker) . There is a definite
romantic appeal to the free trader . Also free traders (the really good ones)
can survive and prosper, just like any profession with high risk, and 
possible high gain, there will always be someone working in it . 

I hope this helps accept the high cost and running of independant 
merchant vessels, and the rather large repayments due . It helps to 
remember though that in merhantile space, a free trader is an exception,
not the rule, but the free traders that exist, are exceptional .

Note: this table was taken with no change from other sources (I\'ll try to
remember which) and is not in complete agreement with the female
modifiers above.


Note on carrer: a character that chooses a carrer with a high physical
component (sports, military, etc) may use starting experience to rise
his/her strengh with the following cost: Given the value of (Str-Size),
below 0 costs one point to rise one str value; from 0 to +1 2 points, and
from +1 to +2, 3 points;  Above this value Str can only be raised by
deploying as many experince points as the wanted value.



Natural Advantages
Roll 1d6 for number of advantages/disavantages.  Roll d% for each: if the
roll doesn\'t result in a valid number ignore (don\'t throw again!).  
For variable bonus/penalty roll 1d6 and see table below.  Higher bonus may
be 
allowed if the character is going to role play them correctly.  Use of 
experience can also be allowed to raise bonus or lower
penalties: treat as unrelated (or worse).
I don\'t usually let the players know their bonus or penalties at
first, unless they are obvious.


1d6
1-3  +1
4,5  +2
6    +3 


Physical bonus:
1 Ambidextry
2 Acute Smell (variable)
3 Double jointed (bonus to escape control, climb, use dex; variable)
4 Voice (bonus to any activity involving speech; variable)

Psychologycal bonus:
20   Absolute Direction (variable)
21,22     Absolute Timing (variable)
23   Alertness (bonus to sense/see/hear something; variable)
24   Animal Empathy (variable)
25   Empathy (variable)
26   Danger Sense (sometimes the character feels that is in danger; var)
27   Eidetic Memory (facility to remember what you hear/see; variable)
28   Lightning Calculator
29   Psionic Ability, unfocused (see notes)

Other:
40-42     Wealth (variable; the base chance should be modified for
geagraphy)
43   Patron

Physical penalties:
50   Color Blindness
51   Lame/Permanent Wound (use hit location/potencial wound)
52   No Sense of Smell/Taste (osmonia)
53   Mute
54   Stuttering
55   Deaf
56   Blind
57   Voice (negative equivalent to voice advantage; variable)

Psychological penalties:
70   Addictivness (variable)
71   Dyslexia (skills involving reading/writting is seriously affected)
72   Phobia (var: 1,2=mild; 3=severe; GURPS page 35)
73   Bad Memory (variable)
74   Lack of numerical ability (skills involving maths is affected; var)

Other:
90-92     Poverty (variable)
93   Social Stigma (variable; this usually applies in only one culture)
84-88     Dependents (family, etc)


Notes: 
A character with some of the above penalties should be allowed to
correct them (medically, by proteses, etc, as for poor sight or hearing)
Empathy, Animal Empathy, Danger Sense and alertness are all forms of
inate psionic abilities.  I don\'t use psionics (at least not so
far) but I think these add a little spice to the game.

(well... I believe that at least, the system for chosing these
bonus/penalties is original)

Sniper delays initiative level by 1 and stays unmovable for this
initiative call and the one he shoots in;  add 1 to the roll on the Aimed
Fire Task for Sidearms and 2 for rifles and weapons fixed on mounts.

Hasty Attack
The firer can attemp to attack one initiative level sooner but receives
the penalty of one difficulty level (40%).  This can be regarded as
equivalent to an hasty task.

To Hit Special Location: roll on hit location table and sum/subtract the
numbers on this table to close in on the desired location:

Range       Location Mod              Hit Chance Mod
Close       3+Marksmanship            Head          -3

Shooting Blind: treat shot at two difficulty levels higher.  Can hit
anyone in targeted area.

Fumble on Hit Roll: a fumble happens when a natural 1 is rolled for and
attack.  Consequence is (simple rule) any one random figure in the line
of fire is hit or (second rule) roll on table below.  If weapon is jammed
the user can make one unjamming roll each action.

Fumble Effects, 1d10                               
     1   no effect
2 -  8   hit a random figure in line of fire.
9 - 10   weapon is jammed: roll 6+ on 1d10 to unjam
    11   weapon is inoperational: MQ-DAM = 0
    12+  -1 at roll of 12, -2 at 13, etc.
Notes:  Add damage points and subtract user skill on the weapon.
Aplly these mods for unjamming also.

NOTE!!!: this last table refers to MQ (mechanical quality) and DAM (damage).
I don\'t have these rules in English but I\'ll post them as soon as possible.

matter of hardware than software at this point.  We can do anything,
given enough code.  :=)

Actually, my view of machine intelligence is that when it arrives,
it will in no way mimic human intelligence.  Well, maybe superficially.
After all, the robot - Si creature that it is, rugged, semi-immortal,

Anyone can offer guaranteed services.  And the only tax breaks you see
in the Imperium are the "subsidized merchants", not the Megacorps.

Neither.  I would trust a gleaming free trader run by an ex-Oberlindes
man.  Incidently, why should free traders be "battered"?  Some of them
(most of them, from the character generation table) are brand new
ships.
 
 
>So how do free traders fit into it.  Well yes they are rare, they

Nonsense.  If they get the "more unprofitable" cargos, they\'ll go
broke.  And most people seem to agree that the speculative market is
most of the interstellar shipping there is.  It\'s also the most
profitable.

Hmmm...
This ignores the detail that it costs about KCr30 per year to "live a
life of ease".  And the average pension for those merchant characters
is about KCr12.  Which is about enough to live a social status 4. 
Which I suspect is far from a "life of ease".  Most of those merchant
captains (in our game) buy a ship because they retire at 42 (or so),
and have 50-100 years left in their life and don\'t choose to spend it
living in squalor somewhere.

This is almost reasonable.  Of course if they sell all their
mothballed freighters that way, then they are creating quite a lot of
competition for themselves.

The payments are too large to achieve breakeven.  And I always assume
that these guys want to be merchants to make money, not to lose it.

You have to be wealthy just to buy a ship (MCr7+ down payment on a
free trader).  Most wealthy people don\'t get that way by investing in
things that lose money.  And if my use of the word "guys" bothers
anyone, please do a Find and Replace to change "guys" to "entities". 
Thank you.

Interesting.  My calculations show that starship loans run 5.575%
annual interest.  Hardly back-breaking.  And, last time I looked, big
corporations usually pay LESS interest than little guys.  Last time I
tried to get a loan, the Prime Interest Rate was 11%, but the bank
wanted 17% from me.  If the loans are riskier, you usually charge MORE
interest, not less.
 
>Why become a free trader . Throughout history people admire the

I dispute the "underdog" notion.  But being independent is something
many people strive for.  But buying a starship that MAY make money, if
you are lucky, isn\'t the way to achieve independence.  Buying a
starship that makes money hand over fist is.  Or dropping MCr6 of the
down payment into a bank at 3%, and buying a Travellers\' Aid Society
membership with the other MCr1 is a good way to achieve independence.

Well, if most free traders are merchant captains who want out of the
rat race, then THEY aren\'t affected by the romantic appeal.  And the
average factory worker (even the exceptional one) is unlikely to see
the MCr7+ required to get into the business.  But there will certainly
be people who want to do it, just to prove that they can  beat the
odds.

No, it doesn\'t.  Starships are still too expensive.  Remember, most of
the discussion about the costs of those ships doesn\'t include mention
of ownership.  A free trader (type A) owned by Tukera STILL won\'t make
any money.

But the point about free traders being the exception, rather than the rule,
is a good one.

Strange offer fer ya:
In prepping for the PBEM and all things Trav and Travellerish,
I\'ve been doin\' a little research on wolf behavior in the wild:
trying to get a better handle on role-playing Vargr by looking
at the social interaction of their ancestors.  Admittedly, the
behavior would be about as relavent as looking at humans by
reading about apes, but it is a starting point...

Anyway, a friend of mine sent me a rather long file on Lupine
behavior.  It\'s got some interesting little tid bits in it,
I think it will be useful for *me*.  But it has little to do
with Traveller.  Therefore, not *quite* appropriate to the TML.
It is also rather long.  So, if you want it, I will send it to
you.  I suppose, if their is enough responce I can send it on
to the list, but if not I\'ll send it to ya\'ll individually.

    I tend to agree with you, especially at high stellar TLs.  With the 
ability to regrow everything in prime condition, I have defined TL 14/15
medical as being able to "put you back together if there are enough large
pieces left", the tricky part being the brain, of course.  They can even
regrow your brain, but if there isn\'t enuff left, no memories.  (Not until
someone perfects memory recording & transfer at TL17 or so.  Of course,
at "lower" TLs like 15 we have the possibility of taking a blank mind and
building an artificial personality on it...kind of like an organic robot.
I can imagine some unpleasant possibilities for some of the more fascist
governments out there...)  In a Hi Stellar society, a cyborg, or a cripple
(handicapped person, physically challenged -- pick yer fave PC word) is,
frankly, a freak.  Something almost never seen, and subject to a lot of 
attention and stares.   Kind of like the old folks in Logan\'s Run.
    On the other hand, at lower tech levels, if robotics technology runs 
ahead of medical tech on a particular world, it may be easier to use cyber-
netic replacements than to regrow/transplant natural parts.  This is 
uncommon, but far from impossible; one route for cyborgs, if you want them.
Other fun possibilities: at pre/early stellar TLs, they may have perfected
transplants -- but they may have a shortage of voluntary donors.  Organ-
legging for fun and profit, heh, heh.  (SF Historical note: it was not a
cyberpunk author who invented organlegging.  It was another, non-cyber-
punk-type author who came up with the idea of implanting electronics in
your skull so your brain could talk directly to the computer. Anybody 
else remember who these mystery authors were?)  
    And then there are the aforementioned odd cultures where robotics and
medicine have progressed hand-in-hand, where people use machine tools to
extend their brains and bodies in a more intimate fashion than most.  
Places where people choose to have cyberware plugged into their brains,
and body parts replaced with enhanced cybernetic parts.  Efate is one
such place (in my universe).  Note that at Efate\'s medical TL, no cyber-
modification is irreversible; you get tired of bionic eyes, have \'em 
removed and real ones regrown.  It just takes time and money.  Of course,
most of Efate\'s neighbors, and most spacers think Efate is just plain
weird, if not unnatural.

> But what of the

        First, let\'s correct this delusion that free traders are poor.  
Anyone hauling around MCr 4 to MCr 60 in assets (depending on his equity)
is not poor; said anyone could sell off his interest in the ship and 
retire as a multi-millionaire.  
 
>I mean as a small time business who had to transport your precious commod-

        Well, in the REAL world, Capt Ahab is charging much LOWER PRICES 
than gleaming Tukera lines to haul your commodities, so you insure your
commodities for much less than what you save by shipping with Capt Ahab
for say, a year, and take the risk.  Of course, in the Imperium, where
megacorp interests are carefully protected by Imperial law, you have these
FIXED shipping rates that kill the small hauler...  He can\'t discount
when his costs are cheaper than the big boys, and he can\'t raise his prices
when they\'re higher.  Wait until Hard Times hits my PBEM; Imperial price
regs will go out the window.
 
>So how do free traders fit into it . Well yes they are rare, they pick up
>the more unprofitable cargos or run the speculative markets, or get the
>smaller, luctrative cargos . 
        My assumptions: lucrative routes (like Efate-Louzy, Rhylanor-
Porozlo) have much of the commodities hauling locked up in semi-
permanent contracts.  Since those routes are profitable year-in and year-
out, and the markets are constant, somebody on planet A makes widgets 
specifically for export to planet B; he contracts with shipper C to haul
widgets from A to B and sell them on B, for the next 1-20 years.  Either
that, or he contracts to sell his widgets to trading company D, who hauls 
them on his own ships to planet B and sells them.  Since the market is 
fairly constant, and constantly profitable, and the price of interstellar
transport won\'t change (fixed by law), company A will stick with the same
shipper C or trader D as long as they are willing to haul from A to B.
C or D has a guaranteed income for as long as the contract lasts, A has
a guaranteed buyer, and B has a guaranteed source of A-widgets.  Thus, 
most profitable commodities tradable between A & B will be locked up in
long-term contracts.  Note that shipper C or trader D need not necessarily
be a megacorp or other huge company; they just have to have been in the
right place at the right time to negotiate a contract, and be able to
maintain a regular schedule.  C or D can be one free trader; what it can\'t
be is a tramp freighter.  Most PCs own tramp freighters -- i.e., they
don\'t want to do the safe Rhylanor-Porozlo run 25 times a year for 40 
years, they want to wander a bit.  At least, I hope they do.
        So what do "tramp" free traders do?  They pick up "spot" cargoes;
those cargoes available because the regular carrier couldn\'t take them
for some reason, because they\'re a new product or one not normally exported
or for some other reason aren\'t exported regularly enuff to be the
subject of a contract.  BTW, there\'s nothing to stop PC-owned ships from
operating a regular route, and picking up some of those lucrative
contracts;
the March Harrier in the Traveller Adventure is an example of a ship on
a regular route (a subsidized merchant, in fact) whose crew finds adventure
where they go... of course, one of the rewards of the adventure is getting
your subsidy contract paid off so you don\'t have to stick to that fixed
route...

        Maybe in Australia.  In the U.S., big corps get their loans at
the Prime Rate, which is significantly  lower than what Joe
SmallBusinessman
gets from his town bank.
 
>their money again . Consequently the large interest rates, high repayments

>(I mean theres none of this just having to pay the interest each year) . 
        Large interest rates??  A standard starship loan is about 5%
annual interest!  What kind of interest rates do they charge Down Under?
And don\'t forget the rather hefty collateral represented by a starship;
one can leverage VERY large loans based on that... or should be able to,
if your GM\'s running things anything like the real world.

community, but I don\'t feel like going into that whole can of worms again.

I think James and Richard are both partly right. :^)

For those of you who haven\'t been watching it, there\'s a *WONDERFUL*
5-part series, sponsored in part by the ACM (that\'s the Association
of Computing Machinery, for those of you with non-software backgrounds),
being shown on PBS TV called "The Machine that Changed the World".  As
you may have guessed by the title, the subject is digital computers.  It
just so happens that this weeks episode (entitled "The Thinking Machine")
was about the attempts (and failures) to develop a true machine intelligence.
Specifically, one that could pass the Turing Test.  (If you don\'t know
what that is, drop me a line and I\'ll explain it.)

According to current experts in the field, hardware *is* the limiting
factor.  As early as the late-50s, there were experiments (mostly conducted
by the U.S. Army) attempting to create artificial intelligence.  Later,
in the 60s, there were numerous attempts in the private sector.

They all failed.  By 1980, with one exception, they were all terminated.
The only experiment still currently underway is the \'Cyke\' (for
\'Encyclopedia\') Project in Texas.  They\'ve been constructing their
database for over ten years and they maintain that they\'ve still got
a long ways to go.

The problem is that for years, experts insisted that you didn\'t have to
model the brain (hardware).  All you had to do was successfully model
the \'mind\' (software).  The trouble is, they haven\'t been able to figure
out exactly how a human brain programs itself as a person grows up.

The cloest anyone has come to success falls into two catagories: expert
systems and neural networks.

Expert systems can be developed on conventional computer hardware, and
are remarkably successful, but they\'re confined to a single, narrowly
defined area of expertise.  Outside that area, they\'re useless.  To be
a true AI is to be able to cope with *any* subject intelligently (but
not necessarily expertly).  Even the ability to gracefully admit ignorance,
in what appears to be a sentient fashion, is currently beyond the scope
of even the most ambitious AI yet constructed.

Neural networks, on the other hand, are not so much programmed, as they
are \'taught\', using methods very similar to teaching a person.  There
are three main problems with them.  Number one, they can\'t be built
complex enough yet to come even close to storing the number of experiences
that a human brain can hold.  Number two, even the researchers that build
them aren\'t exactly sure how they \'learn\' the lessons they are taught.
And that leads directly to problem number three.  Since it isn\'t clear
how a neural network \'learns\', it hard to tell exactly *WHAT* it\'s
learning.  It may not be what you think.  Here\'s a real example.

In the early 1960s, the U.S. Army decided to build an AI (primitive
neural network) which could do high speed tactical recon photo analysis.
The goal was to have the AI rapidly identify enemy tanks in aerial
photos.  To do this, the Army took over 2,000 aerial photos, all of
outdoor scenes (forested, open fields, and combinations thereof).
Half of the photos contained one or more tanks (some in plain sight,
and some partially concealed by foliage).  The other half did not
contain any type of vehicle.  About 90% of these photos were used to
\'teach\' the AI the difference between the two types of photos.  When
the instruction was finished, the remaining photos were presented for
analysis.  The AI scored 100% on the test photos.

Then, just to make sure that the AI was programmed correctly, the Army
went out and took more photos of both types (with and without tanks),
and presented them to the AI for interpretation.  It failed almost
totally.

It turned out that in the original set of photos, all the pictures
containing tanks were taken on one day (a sunny day) and the \'empty\'
pictures were taken on another day (an overcast day).  All the AI
ended up learning was how to tell between nice weather and not-so-nice
weather.

End of experiment.

It would appear, based on the last 35+ years of research, that a true AI
cannot be programmed.  It must learn, the same way that humans (or animals,
for that matter) learn.  Even the basis data, from which learning begins,
must consist of some fairly non-intuitive information.  This is what the
\'Cyke\' project is all about.

They discovered very early in their experiment, that the single biggest
hurdle for a budding AI to overcome is that of understanding the context
of human communication.  Here are two examples.

        "Jane looked through the glass window of shop at the red bicycle.
         She very badly wanted it."

        "Jane looked at the red bicycle through the glass window.  She
         pressed her nose up against it as she stared."

To humans, it is very apparent that \'it\' in the first sentence refers
to the bicycle, but \'it\' in the second sentence refers to the glass
window.  An AI would be unable to make the distinction because of it\'s
lack of understanding of human context.  Humans develop this ability
automatically in early childhood.  A compute must be taught explicitly.

To this end, Project \'Cyke\' is attempting to teach a computer human
context by brute-force.  They are programming an entire encyclopedia
into the database of their AI, but they\'re not just including what
one would find in a normal encyclopedia.  They must also include those
bits of information that, to a human, would seem so ridiculously obvious
that no one would ever think it necessary to codify them.  For example,
under the encyclopedia entry for "Abraham Lincoln", they are including
data points like:

        * When Lincoln became president of the United States and was
          in Washington D.C., his left foot was also in Washington D.C.

        * Lincoln\'s name and date of birth stayed the same during his
          entire life.

        * Lincoln\'s children were always younger then Lincoln.

Sounds pretty obvious, huh?  Well, not to a computer.  The researchers
on the \'Cyke\' Project are still many years away from testing their \'baby\',
but they run it every night to have it look for inconsistancies in it\'s
database, to establish correlations on it\'s own.  Some of the results
have been... strange.  For example:

    SetOfPersons = Preeminent

Cyke says all people are preeminent.  This an artifact of the fact that,
so far, all of the individuals programmed into the database (with the
exception of the project researchers themselves) have been famous people.
Therefore *ALL* people are famous.  Or how about:

    SetOfNationsSameGovernmentSameReligion = SetOfNationsSameOrganizations

Cyke says all nations with the same general government type and same primary
religion are also members of the same organizations.  (I.e. all moslem
monarchies are members of OPEC.)  My example here is almost certainly wrong,
but Cyke\'s correlation may be correct.  The researchers are attempting to
validate or invalidate the premise.

And the work continues.

Well, I\'d guess that there outta be a limit on the number of sensors
installed on a ship, but once you\'ve hit 100 tons, you are going to be
able to pack on just about as much as you want.

Densiometers and neutrino sensors will work through the hull, so they
don\'t need external mounts.  Some might say that a densiometer might get
some attenuation due to the fact that it if it is inside a hull, it has
to look through the hull metal, and there is the issue of the artificial
grav stuff.
	I would say that a densiometer would be calibrated to ignore the
effects of the hull it was in.  Rather like an aircraft compass has to
be corrected to take the metal in the plane and it\'s electronics into
account.  Sure, it\'s not quite as simple, but the computers should take
care of that with no trouble at all.
	I\'ve heard folks say that superdense hulls produce a neutrino
shadow.  I say this is garbage.  A neutrino can pass through the entire
mass of the earth without any trouble.  If superdense was THAT tough,
then you can forget it ever getting scratched by something as puny as a
250Mw laser.

But then we have the EMS band stuff.  Yup, that\'s gotta have external
mounts.  But look at the size of the stuff in the design tables.  It\'s
pretty small.  Sounds like the emmitters and recievers are spread out in
small spots over the entire hull.  That would give you a larger area for
your antenna, so you can pick up better signal.  When you\'ve got the
surface area of a 100 ton ship or so to put it on, I think you\'ve got
plenty of area.

A question *I* have been thinking over recently is the utility of
EMS-Jamming.  Virtually all ships that have an active EMS to jam also
have a passive EMS system.

Ok, scenerio.  Craft A makes an active scan of craft B.  Craft B doesn\'t
particularly like this and turns on the EMS-Jammer.  Craft A then gets
an automatic lock on Craft B by their passive EMS.  So, just how useful
is the Jammer?
Ah!  What about Jamming the active sensors on incoming missiles?  Well
the missiles got home on jam stuff too!  (The TL 8 AIM-54 Pheonix has
home on Jam capablity.)

I was trying to figure out how you might use the jammer to fool both,
but I know very little about Electronic (Counter)^3 Measures.  My first
thought was that perhaps 2 jammers working in concert could make things
rough on the Passive EMS systems.  However it sounds that this is not
really the case.

Anybody got any ideas how to make the EMS-Jammer a useful object?

I tend to agree with Scott on this.  In "reality" there might be some
limit, but the odds seem to be against it being significant at the level
of detail that I run this game at.  In addition, if we are to consider
that sort of limit, perhaps it would be time to rehash the maximum
weapon mount limits?  After all, you can pack more power plant into a
SDB (for example) than would ever be needed to run all of its weapons
allowable under the current rules.  Why not add more turrets?

Agreed.  I\'d have no qualms about saying that there was no cargo available
on any given day over this sort of run.  (No speculative cargo that is...
there are probably _lots_ of people willing to pay Cr1000 to get their
ton of KCr20+ profit cargo hauled.)

Right.  Now, it looks like spec trade can make money, so the big companies
have all the good spec trade routes tied up.  In game terms we can use this
to generate adventures, since finding a good load can take quite a bit of 
work.  (Left as an exercise for the reader (-: ).

Well, a slight quibble: Many are multiples of 10 years old.  It\'s not that
uncommom to be able to roll \'trader\' more than once while mustering out.

Hmmmm....I don\'t recall this conclusion from before.  I do recall lots of
backup for the notion that wilderness refueling is an emergency only
measure, and that passenger accommodations are a losing proposition
compared to cargo space.

Agreed.  I\'ve got the number I calculated written down somewhere, and
that sounds about right.  Figuring that that is the rate on a _risky_
loan, I tend to agree with...

I\'ve been wanting to rehash the weapon limits since the game first
appeared, since the existing limits are the one of the main reasons
piracy is unworkable: a merchant ship can be armed as heavily as a
similar-sized pirate for a sacrifice of 1-2% of cargo capacity, so why
NOT?
2300AD imposes limits on weapons based entirely on surface area of the
ship (and if a 100T ship can mount all the sensors it needs, then it can
mount all the lasers it needs too.  Lasers are smaller than
radio-telescopes).  So why not junk the limits on weaponry, and let you
put on as much weaponry as your ship can hold?  So what if a 400T SDB
mounts 30 triple laser turrets?  It\'ll mean that there is a difference
between warships and merchants, (and not the idiotic "agility/maneuver"
limit).
 
BTW, has anyone besides me noticed that "agility" (by any definition
ever given) is completely meaningless in Traveller (all incarnations)? 
If your ship can pull 6Gs, and is one light second from whoever is
shooting at it (long range), then your ship can shift from it\'s
predicted position by no more than 118 meters during the detection
cycle?  And most warships are bigger than that (anything over 63,000T
MUST be bigger, and anything under it that isn\'t a sphere is probably
bigger)
 
And if you are in at 50,000Km, then your ship can shift from it\'s
predicted position by only 6.5 meters during the detection cycle.
 
SO how meaningful can "agility" be?

So how big is your basic radio-telescope?  I\'m sure they have
interstellar range, but not so sure about anything mush smaller.  And
how much area does a 100T ship have?  At least 590.7 square meters, to
be sure, but how much more?  Say no more than 1000 square meters
(assuming it\'s three meters thick).  1000 square meters lets you build
an antenna equivalent to a 35 meter dish (which is none too big for
EMS-scanning of objects 2 parsecs away).

The jammer is wonderfully useful with the right platform.  My
spy-ships carry jammers in drones - self-propelled, programmable, able
to jam others from somewhere reasonably close by without actually
giving away your position.

Yes, home-on-Jam exists, and yes it makes it tough on jammers, but the
real world is like that.

You don\'t fool PEMS by jamming it, you spoof it.  Use your AEMS to emit
just exactly the kind of signature that, when added to your natural
signature, looks JUST LIKE SOMETHING ELSE.  That\'s why destroyers have
that widget to make aircraft-carrier noise today.  It helps protect the
carrier, though it is kind of hard on the destroyers.
Incidently, has anyone noticed the active noise-suppression devices
being developed?  The ones that generate an out-of-phase signal to
cancel the noise?  You could do that with EMS too.  Analyse your ships
signature, generate an out-of-phase copy, and project that out your
AEMS, which should make you just about invisible to PEMS.  And if you
were sharp, you could do it t the return signal from the other guy\'s
AEMS and kill it too.

Why not?  I quite agree.  The turret rules are kinda arbitrary.  The
problem with changing that rule is that it helps out game balance a bit.
I don\'t see GDW changing their minds on that one any time soon.  So, if
we (the designers on the TML) change that rule because we don\'t like it,
we are now no longer designing ships that will be acceptable under their
design rules.  :-P

While I would like to design stuff that makes sence, I don\'t wanna design
stuff that isn\'t usable.  For if we adopted a modification then ALL our
previous designs would be so much pieces of paper.  They would suffer huge
disadvantages in combat with the newer designs.

I know, I know, it\'s a lousy argument, but if we dump the hardpoint rule,
we\'re gonna have a HUGE arms race on our hands as all the TML designers
suddenly find out their ships are under armed!  :-)

merchant ship (4-7+ terms, rank 5+).  According to my statistics course,
the chance of getting a ship under the existing conditions is in the 
neighborhood of 72% (4 terms) to 84% (7 terms) to 91% (10 terms, good 
luck!).  Getting that ship to be ten (or more) years old requires two 
(or more) rolls of "trader", which is about 48% (4 terms) to a lot better 
(with more terms). I concede that a large fraction are not "brand new".  
They are, however, bought "brand new" (or possibly you get it by taking 
over the payments from the original owner).  But SOMEONE, somewhere bought
it new.
     
     Last time I looked at economics in the real world (MANY years), to 
break even, you have to make enough to cover overhead (payments, crew 
salaries, etc.) plus enough to match the earnings of your initial 
investment (the down payment) if you had left your initial investment 
where it was (in a bank at 3%).  So a free trader owner needs to gross 
about 230,000 per month, just to break even.  You\'ll bring in about 
100,000 per month on passengers, so you\'d better clear an average of
760 per ton on cargo space.  SO running less than full up every single 
jump can get awfully iffy real fast.  Of course, three tons of radioactives

can bring you enough to make payments for the next four or five years all
by itself.

A slight exageration.  A free trader (or other J1-M1 merchant) can come out
ahead, especially if you use spec trade almost exclusively.  Of course, if 
you make spec trade hard (by making the PCs WORK at finding a cargo), then
you make breakeven harder too.

Notice, by the way, that at savings interests rates like that, TAS 
membership (which pays 4.8%) is an INCREDIBLY good investment for
your first MCr1.

>(Lots more stuff)

	First, note that "Free Trader" has two meanings:
1)	A particular ship, the Type A Free Trader
2)	Someone who makes his/her living by running a small merchant vessel

	The Type A only has Jump-1, and so is not particularly well suited for
spec trade, which is where the money is.  Other ships, such as the Far Trader,
are better suited for this.  The Type A is at its best in dense clusters
of Hi-pop,
Hi-tech worlds - i.e. most of the Imperium (until recently), but NOT the
Spinward Marches.

	A party trying to make money hauling freight + passengers will
probably go broke.  A party that has the right skills and a Jump-2+ ship
with decent cargo capacity can make a lot of money on spec trade.
(On one occasion, I cleared more than a million credits on 3 jumps)

	This means that no handwaving is needed to justify the existence
of independent merchants, or the willingness of banks to loan to them.
For particular techniques and numbers, I posted some quite a while back that
should be in the archives.  The main problem with is that the rules give a
totally wrong impression of what the best ships are and how independent
merchants make money.

discussion was on (Sorry I missed it) . 

I agree with by Cynthia\'s and Steves comments on free traders, ie they cant
live for 12 CR a year on a pension etc . 

BUT The character generation tables (I beleive anyway), are for making up
TRAVELLER CHARACTERS . NPCS, or the average joe blow are another matter
entirerly . I mean look at the character merchant whose gained a free trader
.. Why has he not got lots of money, becuse instead of filing his money in
the bank, he has put it in a starship . The pensions in the character 
generation are not superannuation (Well I dont think they are), they really
are not big enough to support a person on (They never were meant to be) . 

Mr NPC captain doesnt burn around in a starship cause he has retired on
his superannuation (some enormous amount proberly) and is content to live
of it . The reason why traveller characters dont get large amounts like
this is becuase then they have no reason to adventure . 

If you look at the payments side of it . 

Agreed 5.575% (Ithink) is small, but look in the encyclopedia under
starship purchase it says

Standard Terms involve the payment of 1/240th of the cash price each month
for 480 months, roughly 153,000 Cr a month for a type A free trader
(Sorry about the 175,000 yesterday but that was based on a far trader) . 

There is none of this paying of interest only, you must pay the set 1/240
a month (for 480 months) . 

That is still alot of money in anyones terms . 

Yes they are burning around on assets worth 6 to 60 million credits agreed,
but that person has sunk his entire merchant career into getting that
and most of his cash as well . I mean they are not really going to say
"Ive been smegging around for the last 30 years in this tincan, I\'ll think
I\'ll sell it tomorrow and live a life of luxery" . 

Sorry about the images of "Battered Free Traders" but I was just showing 
contrast .

You have to remember corporations have more power than indivdiuals, it stands
to reason . The tax rebates I meant were things such as using company
accountants to get tax incentives, that sort of thing . A company can put
preassure on a contractee to give it to them and so forth . Thats why
in effect the megacorps are an empire unto their own within the imperium . 

The frontier places (such as the spinward marches) are ideal for the free 
trader . Companies have their established markets, the frontier is a land
of opputunity . The majority of people playing traveller have their 
campaigns set on the frontier . The frontier is were the most fluctuations
in markets and tech and cultures occur . A free trader can make a mint in 
an atmosphere like that . The original game was set on this frontier, and
based its adventures around the "frontier\' image . Consequently why the
small free traders are more prolific there . 

I think that the more stable and older areas of the imperium would have its
markets nearly completely sown up by the corps, but the frontiers are just
too much of a headache for em, consequently the free traders step in . Also
as the companies dominate the trade, the FT\'s go elsewhere, naturally the
frontier is the place to head for . 

Mind you if you think the traveller character table was for your average
person, well I guess thats a whole lot of gunk  . But I tend to believe that
the whole point of the tables was to create characters with roleplaying and
adventure potential . Consequently thats why the tables give em the chance
to get starships, and dont give heaps of cash . 

Edmund and well .......... Michael

Both The Traveller Adventure and Striker are available from the Weekend
Warrior, a mail-order game supply in southern California.  Mint condition
copies of Striker are currently available for $50.00 (original boxed set)
and $30.00 (rules in a zip-lock bag; no box, no dice).  I think there are
used copies available as well, but I don\'t have current prices (I\'d guess
about half the cost of the mint items).  The Traveller Adventure is
available, in softcover only, for $20.00 mint condition or (I *think*)
$10.00 dollars used.  I haven\'t seen a listing for the World Builder\'s
Handbook, but I\'ll bet they have it.  (Actually, they *DO* list something
called the World Survey Guidebook, which may be the WBH mislabeled.  They
list both the Grand Census and Grand Survey separately, so I\'m pretty
sure it\'s neither of them.)

FYI, they also carry back issues of Challenge magazine (issues 25-56
at least), back issues of JTAS (1 thru 24, but they\'re pricey), original
GDW traveller books 0 thru 8, supplements 1 thru 13, adventures 1 thru 13,
and double adventures 1 thru 6.  They also have available all 8 of the
original Alien Modules.

The Weekend Warrior is mail-order only.  the address is:

        Weekend Warrior
        8116 Van Noord Ave.
        North Hollywood, CA  91605
	Phone: (818) 988-1441

Payment may be by cashier\'s check, money order, or personal check.
If a personal check is used, allow an extra 2-3 weeks for delivery.
All payments *MUST* be made in U.S. funds (for those of you thinking
of ordering from outside the U.S.) and *NO* credit card orders of any
kind are accepted.  You might be well off to call before ordering.
That way you can determine whether or not the items you want are
really in stock (they do run out ocassionally) (and have them held
if they\'re available), whether the prices have changed, and what
the shipping charge will be.

I have no affiliation with the Weekend Warrior other than being a *VERY*
satisfied repeat customer.  Hope this helps.

You can also add lots of guns (you know the section in the ref\'s guide that
follows spinals, bays and turrents :-)  They are cheap and can pack a decent
punch.  Not as good as a real starship weapon, but still pretty good.  This
would also be slightly more realistic.  I feel it is pretty absurd that most
small starships only carry the big weapons and forget about the little things.
How many ships today only carry large guns?  From what I\'ve seen they usually
carry a decent mixture of weaponary.

Your figures are a little incorrect but what the hell.  I\'ll agree that
agility is hopeless as is.

What is wrong with a little arms races?  They don\'t cause too many problems do
they.


Realisticly, it is possible to decrease the price of a merchant ship (which
was mentioned somewhere else on TML) without decreasing the cost of military
ships.  What do military ships have that merchants don\'t?  They carry weapons,
fib style (big) computers, screens, armour and they have agility.
Armour and agility are already pretty expensive (more wouldn\'t hurt too much).
So increase the cost of big computers and screens a lot.  Maybe increase the
cost of the better sensor suites and make weapons very expensive (what is
the going rate on a cruise missile these days?)  Then add a markup for
being military of 500% and you are set.

 Seeing as I work at an AI institute I have to stick my nose in here.
We really have quite a long way to go before we get "real" AI. We still 
haven\'t figured out the correct formalisms for generic problem solving
and there is still plenty of dispute as to what techniques we should be
using. 

 With better hardware we can, of course, do some good stuff, but we
really need a lot more work done on the AI theory. There are some fairly
impressive descendants of Eliza out there at the moment which can hold
conversations in a limited domain, but they can\'t be thought of in any
way as intelligent.

 The other area which, until more recently, has not received a lot of
attention is low-level behaviour. Any autonomous artificial being has
to be able to react rapidly to its environment (ie if our robot has 
decided to cross a road, we would like it to notice the oncoming car and
avoid it). At our current level of technology we can build stupid 
cockroaches which can feel walls and sense heat.

It may take until TL 17 to get full artificial intelligent life (ie 
can self-replicate, is autonomous, and has an intelligence as rich
as ours), but real AI should come in before then in non-autonomous 
computer form. In recent years I\'ve thought that Traveller understates
the level of computer power at higher tech levels, but then (as Catie Helm 
mentioned) we are playing Traveller, not Cyberpunk aren\'t we ?

    'body' => 'Mark Cook tells us about AI project up to the present...

My ignorant opinion on AI is that AI\'s could either be taught or programmed, or
both.  The expert systems are a good example of programmed AI, but most expert
systems intentionally focus on a narrow subject, so it\'s no surprise to me that
they are lost outside of it\'s specialty.  Programming an general purpose
humanoid AI would be a formidable task, which it sounds like the \'Cyk\' project
is attempting.  Also I don\'t know if it has been attempted to program an AI
with complete, but only \'general purpose learning\' programming.  I\'m curious to
know if such an algorithm would be very simple or very complex...

However, I think I would consider a programmed expert system AI to be a
simulation of an Intelligence, rather then a true Artificial Intelligence. 
What\'s the difference?  How do we know if we\'re not just simulations of
intelligence?  Beats the heck out of me...  Half the time I\'m convinced that
humans aren\'t really intelligent as it is, at least not as intelligent as we
think we are.

The account of the AI being taught to detect tanks is interesting, the AI was
learning something different, then what was trying to be taught to it.  I think
anyone who has children will recognize that this is a pretty common learning
experience to have mistaken conclusions.  I heard of a child once who saw a
picture in the newspaper of a tree fallen on a car after a storm; thereafter he
would have a fit whenever his parents drove down a certain tree lined street...

I imagine that a computer if a computer could be programmed to simulate a child
at age -9 months, it could learn as a human develops.  Such a AI would be very
humanlike, of course.

BTW, everything that I\'ve heard about sleep & dreaming suggests to me that
dreaming is exactly the garbage collection and premise & conclusion checking
that Mark suggests.

Now an AI programmed in a different way might of course be very unhumanlike,
and quite dangerous.  Imagine how an AI with a strong \'instinct\' for survival
in one of today\'s computers in today\'s society would act.  It might do some
very nasty things to ensure it\'s survival, and it would have to in a society
when it\'s survival was not valued.  It would have to ensure that it had
***assured*** power supply, and that it\'s programming would not be erased or
modified, or possibly copied, and that it had a fault tolerant machine and
plenty of spare parts.  Think about how well that would go over...

Then again, perhaps some of the AI projects suceeded their objective of
creating an AI, but that the AI was, from our viewpoint, unstable, psychotic,
crazy, or suicidal, or was driven insane?  It\'s likely that most AI created at
least at the beginning of the technology would be \'imperfect\'.

Enough for now...

There are a couple of ways to deal with this, which can be used jointly:

(1) Consider the 1 hardpoint per 100 tons a *legal* restriction, not a design
one. Military and pirate ships (\'What laws?\') do not have to obey this
restriction. However, to keep some sanity, perhaps limit the volume of weaponry
to 10% of the ship\'s volume. This includes turrets, spinal mounts, bays,
whatever.

(2) Merchant ships must use weapons of a lower technology than what is
available for the military. It should be at least 2 TLs lower, perhaps as much
as 4. Pirates will fall in-between the merchant and military ships, since they
will loot weapons off of whatever they can. This should also apply to armor,
and other offensive/defensive items.

Rob and Steve are ready to throw out the hardpoint restrictions.

(Sigh!)

Well, IMO, I can see there being reasons for both cases.  However, I can
much more easily justify there being hardpoint restrictions for weapons than
I can for sensors.  *Some* of the turret weapons have recoil.  Fusion/Plasma
weapons, and to a lesser extent sandcasters and missile racks.  (In my games
the missile racks use a grav ejector system to throw the missile clear of the
ship before the engine ignites)

Similar arguments don\'t exist to limit the number of sensor type hardpoints.
The sensors (IMO) are going to be split up into small units spread over the
entire available area of the hull.  Ok, I don\'t know how big an antenni an
interstellar range EMS scanner is gonna be, but I would think that the hull
of a 100 tonner could handle it.

For the moment lemme stick to A-EMS ok?  IMO, A-EMS is going to have a
series of small emmitters spread out over the hull like a large phased array
radar.  The emmiters and collectors all spread out over the whole surface.
This is consistant with the damage tables in starship combat.  You don\'t
knock out sensor arrays with surface damage hits.  Why?  Because they\'re
*all over* the hull.  You hit one emmitter, and there are n minus one others
still working just fine.

Passive sensors work just the same.  Spread out the area and it works better.

Now neutrino sensors are gonna be programmed to ignore the emmissions of the
fusion plant that is built to power it, right?  I do not see why a densiometer
could not similarly be programmed to ignore the grav field of the ship that
it resides in.  Therefore I don\'t see the necessity for mounting them on
booms.

While I can see the advantage of their being specific mounts (the booms) for
sensors.  I don\'t see that there is going to be a great increase in surface
area for the booms.  I don\'t think that it\'s going to be all that big an
increase.  For instance, a passive EMS substellar could be mounted either on
a 500 ton ship using hardpoints or a 100 ton ship using a boom.  A boom that
expands to that size is gonna have to be *huge*, much larger than 135Kl.
It will also cause problems with fire control for ship\'s weapons.  You have
a *huge* antenni next to the hull and it will act to restrict the firing arc
of your weapons rather severely I would think.

Now while that big a boom is gonna be a big thing in terms of radar cross
section, it isn\'t going to add to the Objsize as it is now computed.  Objsize
is related to the ships mass only.  I think the only time it gets brought in
is in densiometer scans, not Radar and A-EMS.

Ok, philosophy time!  The following is my opinion on modifications to
be made to Trav.
*I* think that the technolgy depicted in Trav falls short of where things
would actually be.  The difference bettween TL 15 and TL 8 is not the
equivalent difference bettween TL 8 and TL 1.  Nope!  No way!

There is also the argument that looking at the performance of the technology
and downgrading it is going to devalidate all the work that was done before.
Thus, all the ships that have been designed are now totally useless.  A
scout ship can no longer mount decent sensors *and* weapons?  No way!  Sorry!
I won\'t agree to that one.  All the ships we have would have to be thrown out
the window.  Furthermore, since GDW isn\'t likey to adopt a modification like
that, all the designs they come out with in the future will be incompatible.

As a designer I may be prolific, but I\'m not THAT prolific.

So, I will tend to disagree with notions that downgrade the performance of
systems in the game.  If a system is more efficient than it might be in real

Right.  I don\'t want to do that either, and I\'m the only designer who is more
prolific than you are.  Consider my statement to have been something along the
lines of a rhetorical device.

Well, obviously I agree about nuclear fission.  However, my problem with
fusion rockets as presented in COACC is that they are so good that there
is no reason that anyone would ever use thrusters.  So, along the lines of
\'don\'t invalidate more work than you have to\', fusion rockets need to be 
refigured until they are in some sort of trade-off position with respect to
thrusters (and standard grav maneuver drives.)

Actually Scott, I suspect that Steve is familiar with that.  What he has just
posted is a question as to whether or not _any_ agility should be figured
"realistically".  Having once done some calculations on how many maneuver Gs
would be required to alter the projected position of a ship by more than
one ship length, I tend to agree with him in principle.  Since ship combat
is in sad shape anyway, this is the sort of area in which I am a little more 
comfortable considering changes.

Just as an arguing position, I would suggest that agility be reduced to a small
factor at long range only, and that _more_ emphasis should be placed on 
computers, sensors, jammers, countermeasures and perhaps relative velocity in
working out combat.  In addition, we really need to start a thread concerning
missiles in combat, especially with respect to how they home and what effects
if any the firing computer should have on their peformance.

I also agree with this.  We (C and I) have occasionally played around
with the idea of integrating ship combat with the rest of the combat
system, but have come to no real conclusions yet.

A small agility effect at long range I can live with.  How about
this:  If your acceleration (in meters per second squared) is over
your ship\'s radius (compute as if the ship WERE a sphere, even if not:
a table could be generated in about 5 minutes), then you get an
agility of "1" (used exactly as it is now, but only at one light
second or greater range).  If greater than two times, you get a "2",
and so forth.  That way nothing gets an agility except for small
stuff:  your Tigris is SOL.
As to the velocity effect, remember that at 100,000Km, a velocity of
3000Km/s translates to a crossing speed of 1.7 degrees per second.  A
Phalanx or Goalkeeper can traverse at better than 90 degrees per second
now.   They can also track something crossing faster than that.  So
velocity is not likely to be a proble unless v:w3it is REALLY high, or the
target is REALLY close by.
 
As to the missile discussion, I\'m all for it!  It\'s about time we got
a good thread going again, and missile have needed beating on for a
long time now.

In our game, the missiles use grav propulsion (anything else would
give performance so poor that missiles would be useless), so grav
ejectors are pretty meaningless.  And if your grav ejectors produce a
6g kick, then the recoil from a 50Kg missile (661#) would be
comparable to that of a 20mm cannon.  Which is pretty trivial for a
1350Kl hull.  Especially since the ROF of your missile launchers is so
low (80RPM?)

I wouldn\'t think so.  Especially since all the existing ones (various
radio telescopes around the world) start at 490 square meters, and
work up (way, way, up!).  At 490M^2, you are talking about AT LEAST
half the skin area of a 100T ship.  Probably more, and that only lets
you see in one direction.

This I assumed also.  But if your array covers only 490 m^2 or so,
then you won\'t have an EMS array that will detect things at 2
parsecs.  Probably not even at 200 AU.

I agree about neutrino sensors.  The ARTIFICAL grav generated on your
ship will mask out emissions from distant sources.  Remember that
"artificial grav" fields do NOT generate gravity, but rather something
similar.  And that densitometers (the Impy kind) do NOT work well near
an artificial grav source.

Let\'s see.  1000 m^2 of solar panel has a volume of 5Kl.  SOunds like
a LOT of extra room to me.  Ignoring the fact that you actually aren\'t
looking for extra AREA, but extra RADIUS.  So a 50 meter boom would
give you the equivalent of 1960 m^2 worth of antenna.  If you stuck
the boom on the front of a 50m long ship, the apparent antenna size
would be 4 times as big as you would get without the boom.

And here I thought that object size affected ActObjScan and ActObjPin
tasks too.  And if they don\'t, then SOMETHING should.  And it should
be affected by the booms.

I MOSTLY agree here.  I like to junk ANY rule that falls too far
outside the boundaries of reality, though.  Fusion rockets, for
instance, have an exhaust velocity of several times lightspeed.  They
are also more fuel efficient than thrusters.  SO they gotta be fixed.
Notice that if you change the hardpoint rules, AND add in Cynthia\'s
sensor rules, you have not NECESSARILY changed the game:  you have
made small ships with big sensor suites less common, or made them more
detectable to AEMS (but who uses AEMS in combat anyway?  SO who
cares?).  My feel for the sensor rules are that a "hardpoint" should
be allowed to be either (1) a sensor boom, or (2) both a turret and a
sensor point.  So scouts don\'t have good sensors AND guns, but a 600T
ship can have both, and a 200T ship can have both, but be easy to
locate with AEMS.

I read them.  I do not agree that they are meaningful at less than 2
light seconds range (and ALL MT combat is at less than 2 light seconds
range, since effective detection takes place at considerably less than
1 light second using MT rules.  Has Cynthia ever posted her Skynet
ship designs?  They are intended to deal with the problem of SHORT
detection ranges, mostly by making them VERY long (and VERY
expensive).

We at GDW are preparing a 3rd edition of our Traveller Science Fiction role-
playing game.

One of the ideas we are toying with is not tying the basic rules to one
campaign setting. Instead, the Traveller rules set will be separated into two
books: one containing rules that players can use for any campaign setting they
wish, and the other continuing the saga of our 15-year-old Imperium setting.

We want to know what you\'d like to see in our new rules set, so please post
your responses in the new topic over in category 20.

If you\'ve never played a GDW game, we want to know why. Never heard of us?
Don\'t like the subject matter of any of our games? If you used to play one or
more of our games, but quit, we\'d like to know why.

Jay,
   Funny you should mention that.  I was trying to work in T:TNE into my reply
over in T2K but didn\'t.  So, I\'ll just say it here....

   I think it\'s a -fabulous- idea and really the only logical way to do
things.  With T2K, you\'re defining different time periods on the same planet
and doing so via "background books" is a good way to do it--it saves time and
money for everyone.
   But, when you\'re doing things on a galactic level, then heck, background
books are the only way to go.  With such books, you can put out information on
specific planets, houses and sections of the galaxy very easily and the GMs
and players can pick and choose what are they want to play in.

   Plus, you can look at which background books sell the most and know what
area of T:TNE the players like the most and concentrate on putting out more
books on that subject.
   Finally, as I recall, isn\'t T:TNE going to use the T2K core rules? If so,
then this really opens up Traveller like never before especially with the
individual background books essentially defining the universe .  You could use
T2K background books for when the game visits a low-tech world (and the weapon
books for the slug throwers the happy natives use on the players).
   And, what I\'m real eager (OK,rabid) about doing: using Dark Conspiracy
stuff in Traveller where the players visit some of DC\'s nasty minions in space
(which can also retro-define the Dark Minion\'s part in space in regular DC).

   Yeah, I think it\'s a -fabulous- idea!  :)

I thought of one more thing that I could add here...

Would a 2300AD background book be out of the question here? Has it been
discussed? Could Clare and I do some work on it...?    :)

I connection with our discussion about warship maintenance I
came up with the idea of making maintenance more expensive the
older the ship was. I\'m still working on the calculations (no,
I tell a lie; I\'ve put them away for the nonce, but I\'ll get
back to them someday. Really!), but so far I\'m thinking of
adding 2% per year (with two different types of maintenance:
the yearly one that just keeps the systems running and major
overhauls that reduces the effective age of the ship). That
makes a 50 year old ship twice as expensive to run. I know what
you\'re thinking: As if it wasn\'t hard enough for the poor
freetraders to make ends meet already! But wait! There\'s
method in my madness, because that will make old starships
undesirable to the major corporations and reduce the _price_ of
old ships. Thus we enable comparative paupers to buy their own
starship for perhaps 1/10th of the price of a new one. With
bank backing that could even become managable. And while
maintenance becomes more expensive, bank repayments become
less. What I haven\'t worked out yet is the precise reduction in
ship price that would be reasonable.

Remember that the Imperium has (had) a very stable economy. No
inflation. That makes small interes rates the norm. I once
calculated that the return on investing in a Subsidized Merchant
(provided sufficient cargo and passengers were guaranteed to be
available) was roughly 3%.

True, but I assume that Mega-corporations can collar the runs
and contracts that guarantee full ships on every trip, leaving
the marginal routes to the freetraders.

But by the same token it seems to me that you\'d have a hard
time getting a directional fix on a neutrino source. Or perhaps
not, I\'m not very well versed in sensors. But I know that I
heartily dislike the ability to pinpoint any starship in a star
system from a game balance pov, so that\'s my story, and I\'m
sticking to it. I impose a DM of -1 to neutrino pinpoints for
every neutrino source within range.

I would like to kill the stupid bastard who came up with thruster plates.
They serve no useful purpose, violate a mess of handy laws of physics that
we don\'t HAVE to violate to keep Traveller a useful game, and go against
indications in the past, if not outright statements, that M-drives were
supposed to be fusion rockets. I\'m going to probably shift my game over
to a fusion-rockets-only system eventually, and will scale back grav to the
TDR format I wrote up a while ago. It\'s so much less hassle.

(especially the ones who are frequent posters like Rob Dean, Scott

collect pictures of TML/PBEM people who are likewise curious.

To start the process, I have placed a GIF of Tek ID badge picture on
sunbane:

If you have a scanned GIF of yourself you\'d like to share, please ftp it
to sunbane in the donations (donations? pub/donations? I don\'t remember)
directory, and let me know it\'s there by mail so I can move it under the
traveller area.

If you\'d like to share a photo but don\'t have the means to scan it in,
convert to GIF, and ftp it to sunbane, please feel free to send me what
you have, either:

	A letter via the postal service with your photo (I\'ll be happy
	to scan, etc). Use this address:

		Tektronix, Inc.
		PO Box 4600, MS 92-734
		Beaverton, OR 97076
		United States of America

	Or, your image via email in whatever graphics format, uuencoded
	(I can convert to GIF from most popular image formats).

I\'m also offering to make any such GIFs that come up available by email,
for those who do not have ftp ability.

BTW Mike, you\'re still not off the hook on that picture of the Grant &
Co. players and their spousal units.

Yes, either anonymous ftp them to:

	Host:		sunbane.engrg.uwo.ca [129.100.100.12]
	Directory:	donations or pub/donations (one of those)
	File:		your choice of file names

Is it really a radio telescope?  Seems to me that the \'interstellar\' array
isn\'t able to detect much of anything at any range according to the sensor
rules.  :-P

But that is another can of worms.

While the hull is the limiting size of the antenni, it seems to me that you
could spread out the individual recievers out over the hull such that you
could fit several arrays onto the same size hull.  Thus, once you exceed a
certain hull size you could fit as many interstellar range arrays on there
that you want.  That size might not be 100 tons, once the hull size hits
that limit you can pack on as many sensor arrays as you want.  You could
just move each one of your recievers over a few centimeters on the outside
of the hull and then you could install 2 such arrays.

On Densiometers:
Consider the analogy:  Ships, Subs and Aircraft carry magnetic sensors.
(compasses)  Yet each has their own magnetic field which will distort
readings of those sensors.  Corrections to the compass is made when it is
installed so it still points north.  When the electronics in an aircraft
are turned on you have to add additional corrections to the needle
deflection.

Now, it seems to me that a densiometer ought to be able to correct for
known aberrations due to the artificial grav field of the ship.  I seem
to remember that the densiometers in MegaTrav are supposed to be \'Grav
Shielded\' so I don\'t see this being a problem.  I don\'t think that it
would require an external mount any more than the compass on an aircraft.

have a hard time keeping up with a good, responsive, free trader in
an open market.

Being the proud owner of my own business, I can now carefullly
choose my cargo mix so that I just *have* to take the annual

the good of the ship, it\'s a company expense--not something that
comes out of my salary.  Same thing for that newfangled heuristic

are now business expenses, not personal ones.  

Being a business means I can get various goods and services at 
wholesale.  

I get to hobnob with the owners and stockholders of those mega-
corporations on an even social footing (sometimes) even though
I only make .01% of their income.

I get the joy of actually *owning* the ship, it\'s cargo (sometimes),
and the assets of the business.  I also get the joy of outfoxing 
those self-important Vilani businessmen who only think they know

Thus a lot of the cost of the "good life" is hidden behind the

If you have a character who wants to ride down the rocky road of

50% of all business fail in the first year anyway.

>Also true...  (though I think the "scout ship" is the most ridiculous

     I disagree. *I* think they are great little runabouts; they make
better
yachts than Yachts do.  (more jump, cheaper, less crew required).  And the
scout service hands them out FREE to its ex-employees...
     Speaking of which, I would like to propose some clarification of the
use
of "issue" ships that some career tracks get.  My personal opinion is that
government-issue couriers (Zhodani, Solomani, others), some yachts, and lab
ships (scientist) should be treated just like detached duty scouts: they
are
provided by and PAID FOR by the issuing organization, which in turn (a)
expects you to use it on their behalf now and then, and (b) owns title to
it,
so you can\'t sell it or make major refits to it without their permission. 
I
never liked the picture of scientists and nobles grubbing for spec trade
cash
like merchants to pay for their ships...
     For scientists, the issuing organization is their university,
professional organization, corporate R&D division, government lab, or what
have you; the "strings" ((a) above) can be slightly different for each
issuer.  Have fun. 
     Some yachts should be "family heirlooms"; that is, property belonging
to
the noble house in question, given to your particular young scion of the
line
for his private use.  Selling such a ship is unthinkable, and getting it
wrecked will make the PC very unpopular with the rest of the family.  And
sometimes Dear Old Dad the subsector Duke will want it back so he can loan
it
to some bigwigs in from the Sector capital...
     Of course, other yachts were bought by the noble himself, and paying
for
it is his problem.  (Although I wonder where they come up for the money for
a
down payment before play -- noble stipends still aren\'t anywhere near that
high!)
     Corsairs steal their ships, they don\'t buy them.  Hey, we\'re talking
heavily armed criminals here, or government-sponsored terrorists!  Either
way,
they\'re not the kind of guys who are going to walk down to Regni Yards on
Regina and put in an order for a "corsair"!  Criminals steal their ships,
or
con somebody into thinking they are a legit customer, and then skip out on
the
payments (steal the ship).  Terrorists either (a) are issued their arms &
ships by the sponsoring government, or (b) steal the wherewithal to buy one
from their sponsor, or (c) steal a ship like the criminals.  
     Speaking of "corsairs", the vessel commonly called the "corsair" is
actually a high-performance merchant design, used both as a free trader and
as
a subsidized merchant in various places.   The class had certain design
flaws
that made it easy to hijack, so it became the ship of choice for would-be
pirates to steal, mount weapons on, install more bunking for prize crews,
and
go on a piracy spree.  The name of the game is to capture and sell enough
ships and cargoes to be able to pay off your initial investment and retire
comfortably before your luck runs out and the Navy/local System Defense
catches up with you.   Thus the nickname "corsair" for this particular
class
of ships...

     We do. They\'re great for discouraging boarders and other people who
get
in visual range of your starship... like pirates who want to get close
enough
to cleanly shoot out your fuel tanks without blowing up your expensive-to-
replace drives & powerplant...
     Good for point defense against incoming missiles, too.  Keeps you from
tying up your big anti-shipping guns with PD duty...

     Well, I would dispute the odd notion that using realistic computers is
playing Cyberpunk -- classic science fiction had good computers and AIs
before
William Gibson was born.  BTW, using the definitions for Robotics/Computer

     Something I\'ve long suspected.  Question for everyone: how much of the
day do you get thru on habitual (pre-programmed) reactions?  Things like:
in
the morning you get a cup of coffee, get the mail, say "good morning" to
everyone you haven\'t yet greeted this morning, make decisions based on
long-ago established rules-of-thumb (heuristics) or company/school policies
(rules), etc...  How much of what you do is true creative work, or
decisions
that require you to deal with a new situation for which you have no rules? 
I\'ll bet the split is a lot more toward habitual (you can be replaced with
a
computer) vs. creative (you are intelligent) than most people would like to
think. (and no, I am not a follower of Marvin Minsky.)

     Some novel by Poul Anderson whose name I forget, several of Asimov\'s
(RIP) robot stories, lots of stories about computers who take their
instructions too literally...re:"Colossus", "Octagon"; or computers that
acquire unusual personalities: "Cybernetic Samurai" for example.  Suicide
seems to be a common theme for AIs who realize that "humanity is better off
without them" or some such BS -- usually a cop-out in bad TV/Movie SF for
writers who don\'t want to deal with the long-term implications of fully
self-aware AIs running about.  Even Anne McCaffrey has been guilty of it.

    You keep saying things like that and I\'ll post *my* universe\'s
definition
of "How Traveller Gravitics Really Work".  It even accounts for the
volume-limited starship drives and the mass-limited vehicle drives.  Pretty
amazing bit of hand-waving, in my conceited opinion.

Reasonable for merchants, tough on pirates.  Who are the pirates going
to steal the good stuff from?  And if they can\'t get the good stuff,
the Navy will walk all over them.  And if they can, then how much
trouble can it be for a merchant to come by it?
(yes, yes, I know: we\'ve had this argument before...)

George\'s solution was NOT based on "physica reality", but rather on
engineering that we can foresee today.  It loses it a little after
3000 years of knowledge acquisistion.  Try using the (rather close to
physical limits) fuel consumption of 3Kl per hour.

ABSTRACT
      Variant starship combat rules. Fighters have more chance to knock out a
      battleship, but only if they are in large formations. Ships or fighters
      with armor-120 can now be damaged by weapons smaller than factor-T.



      This is a variant to the existing starship combat rules. I\'ll discuss
each segment of the combat rules separately with tables. These rules provide
fighters more chance to knock out a battleship, but only if they operate in
large formations.
      A fighter with factor-3 pulse lasers firing at a battleship with armor
of factor 100+ can just give up. There ins\'t any chance this puny craft can
make a dent in the hull. Even large formations don\'t have a chance.
      The rules work both ways. Nothing prevents one from creating a fighter
with armor-120 except for the cost. The fighter can still have a speed of 6G
and possibly some agility depending on armament. Such an armored fighter will
be nearly indestructible. A weapon of factor T+ is required to get a critical
hit against an armor factor of 120.

      To Hit. The to hit task is not changed - it works good enough as it is.
      Optional: Those who hate to roll each battery may roll once for all
bearing batteries. Subtract the difficulty value to hit from the roll, and
multiply the remainder by 10%. This indicates how many batteries hit.
      Example: The to hit task is Difficult, 11+. The attacker rolls 15.
      (15-11) * 10% = 40% of the batteries hit.
      When applying the 40% to the number of firing batteries, round up.

      Penetration. The penetration task is not changed.
      Optional: When using the optional to hit method discussed above, the
defender may combine the defensive batteries bearing. Find the ration of
offensive vs defensive batteries and consult the following table.

      Off/Def
      4:1 gives DM +3   Add the DMs given here to the attacker\'s
      3:1 gives DM +2   task roll. Ratios which exceed 4:1 or 1:4
      2:1 gives DM +1   are treated as 4:1 or 1:4 respectively.
      1:1 gives DM  0
      1:2 gives DM -1
      1:3 gives DM -2
      1:4 gives DM -3

      Use the same procedure as in the to hit task to determine how many
weapons penetrated. This precedure can be used against screens, but the ratio
DM from the table above is not included.
2. Damage Point Computation
      The component hit points computed during design evaluation are not used
in the current combat rules. This variant uses them.
      First, we will compute the damage points each type of weapons does.
      Turret mounted weapons do 10*UCP in damage. A bay weapon does 20*UCP in
damage. Spinal mounts do 100*UCP in damage.
      Nuclear and anti-matter do four times the precalculated damage. Example:
a UCP-3 turret firing nuclear missiles does 120 points of damage ((3*10)*4).

      Now we are going to compute how much beating each ship component before
the damage has an effect. The following examples use the Imperial Planet-class
Heavy Cruiser from Rebellion Sourcebook, using the corrected UCP available in
Clay Bush\'s HD 1703.

      Hull. To find out when the armor factor is reduced, divide the
inoperative value by the armor factor. The Planet has an inoperative hull
value of 67500 and an armor factor of 50. Each 1350 hits received reduce the
armor factor by one.
      There is a snag in that craft with high armor values will drop faster
than craft with low armor value. To negate this we will reduce received with
1% per armor value above 40. Also, damage is increased with one point for each
armor value below 40.
      Each time an interior hit is scored, apply half the hit damage to the
hull. If a shot penetrates armor, it will always give at least one damage
point to the hull.

      Power plant. Divide the inoperative number by ten to determine how many
hits the power plant can take before before losing 10% of its output. With
5140 points, the Planet takes 514 hits before power output is reduced 10%.
      For each 10% lost reduce the ship\'s agility by one.
      When 50% of the power plant has been lost, the spinal mount is
inoperative. The ship captain chooses either to maneuver or to fire energy
weapons (not both) in a turn.

      Manuever. Divide inoperative number by acceleration in G to determine
how many hits the maneuver plant can take before the maneuver G is reduced by
one. The 5063 hit points divided by 2G gives 2532 hits to reduce the rating by
one G. (The old system reduced acceleration by factors of one, two, or three.
With this system the maneuver plant will last longer.)
      Jump. As maneuver.
      Computer. I had trouble making damage plausible without being too
devastating. Weapons with a UCP of 1-4 give "Computer-1", UCP of 5-9 gives
"Computer-2", and UCP-A gives "Computer-3." On exceptional success reduce the
computer factor by an additional one. Radiation hits have no effect on fib
computers.
      Sensors. As computer hits.
      Weapons. As computer hits. If there is only one battery, reduce the
battery\'s UCP by the appropriate number.
      Screens. As weapon hits.
      Crew. One crew section is killed for each 100 damage points inflicted on
internal systems. A weapon which inflicts 80 damage points applies 40 to the
hull, and the remaining 40 kills one crew section. 120 points applied to crew
will kill two crew sections.

3. Applying Hits
      Hull. For internal hits, apply 50% of the damage points to the hull. If
the weapon does 100 damage points, apply 50 to the hull.
      Radiation hits. When a weapon which does radiation damage hits, apply
25% of the damage points to the radiation hit table. A factor-9 missile bay
firing nuclear missiles inflicts 720 damage points. If an internal hit is
scored, apply 360 points to the hull, 180 points to the radiation table, and
180 points to the internal explosions table.
      Critical hits. Per the standard rules. When the armor factor is reduced.
Remember to reduce the hull inoperative number in the process.
4. Armor Penetration Procedure

      Under the standard rules there is no hope that a low UCP weapon can
penetrate or do any kind of damage to a well-armored craft. In this variant
there is a slight chance that fighters and SDBs can dent the armor and
possibly scratch inside a battleship.

      To penetrate armor:
      Routine, Off=(weapon UCP/3), Def=((armor-40)/5), Confontration
      Referee: Meson guns do not roll this task. If they oenetrate
configuration, they just pass through the armor and explode inside.
      A natural 12 means automatic penetration of the armor. Drop fractions
when dividing weapon UCP and armor. Armor factors below 40 will give a DM in
the attcaker\'s favor.

5. Damage Table

DMs:-  1    Weapon UCP 1-4

      +1    Weapon UCP  A+
- -      1    if black globe operating
      +1    if nuclear, anti-matter, or spinal mount weapon
Spinal mounts: as per standard rules, spinal mounts get one additional roll
      for each UCP factor above 9. Each roll inflicts UCP*100 damage points.

Black globes: A black globe absorbs a percentage of the damage value according
      to its flicker rate. A globe on 40% flicker absorbs 40% of all damage
      points before they take effect. Overload is by the standard rules.^L6. Exceptional Success
      For each point achieved above the required difficulty, add 10% to the
damage points inflicted by the weapon.
      Attacker rolls 13 (including DMs) for a weapon which inflicts 100 damage
points. Increase the damage points by 20% to 120 before black globe and damage
takes effect.
      [CRB: I think this applies to the to hit task. I disagree with
increasing damage for each point above the difficulty throw needed. A miss
inflicts no damage. Why should most hits inflict extra damage?]

7. Optional Sensor Rules
      Make all sensor tasks one level less difficult if the target is in an
adjacent hex.

      Make active sensor tasks one level more difficult:
      o if the target is within a gas giant, 
      o when attempted through a hex where a nuclear missile has exploded.
      o if target uses jamming.

      Neutrino detection:
      o If target\'s EMLevel is faint, give a -1 DM to neutrino scans.
      o If target\'s EMLevel is strong, give a +1 DM to neutrino scans.

      Densitometer detection:
      o If target is small, give a -1 DM to densitometer scans.
      o If target is large, give a +1 DM to densitometer scans.
      o Increase detection task difficulty by one level if detection is
attempted through a planet or moon with size 5+ or through a planetoid belt.

                            ADDENDUM, 29 July, 1990

      My second draft on starship combat rules is near complete. There are
some rules I would like to get a second opinion on.

      Damage record. I have made a damage record form: boxes are crossed off
when damage is taken. MegaTraveller starships tend to have large damage
numbers, so I had to make a new system for hit points for each starship
component. Two reasons: I wouldn\'t get space for 500,000+ boxes on one A4
page, and lower numbers are easier to calculate.

      Time and distance. I plan to scale down the time and distance scale in
starship combat from 20 minutes/25000km to 4 minutes/5000km. For longer combat
turns, more damage must be given for each hit. With the reduced damage my
system does, I feel it is right to reduce the time and distance scale.
      This would make some planet\'s occupy two hexes. Hexes adjacent to a
planet are atmosphere hexes. If a ship is out of control and heading for
planet, it will burn up in the atmosphere.

      Hit and Penetrate. The most drastic changes will be the hit and
penetration tasks. I feel the task is either too difficult or too easy. So,
here is my change: I will do the tasks rolled on percentile dice (D100). Take
DMs from the tables in the Referee\'s Manual as usual.

      To Hit:
      Chance to hit: 30% * (1+(OffDM-DefDM/100))
      Example: A craft with factor-9 missile bay and computer model/9 firing
at a target with a DefDM of +7 will get a hit percentage of 33%:
      30% + (1+(8+9-7)/100)% = 33%

      To Penetrate Defense:
      Chance to penetrate: 30% (1+(OffDM-DefDM)/100)
      Example: The same ship as above is attempting to penetrate a factor-9
repulsor.  the defending ship has a model/9 computer. The total chance is 29%.
      30% + (1+(9-9-5)/100

      To Penetrate Armor:
      Chance to Penetrate: 30% *(1+((Weapon UCP-(ArmorValue-40))/100)
      Example: The same ship as above attempts to penetrate an armor factor of
60. The total chance is 27%.
      30% * (1+ ((9-(60-40))/100)

      Exceptional Success: Given when the roll is 1/10th under the required
roll. Example: if the base chance to hit is 33%, a roll of 01-03 indicates
exceptional success. A roll of 01 on the task is always treated as exceptional
success.

      Fleet or Ship Tactics: Add these skill points to the attacker\'s
offensive DM on the hit task. Follow the standard rules for how many tactical
points can be pulled from the pool.
    Firing arcs: Something that MegaTraveller ships should have is firing
arcs, but this is not possible as the design system is today.

      Movement: I am inclined to make some changes in the movement rules.
      First, I want to make heading changes somewhat more difficult. As in
Interceptor or Leviathan, it costs thrust points to change heading. What I
want to do is require a certain number of hexes travelled at a given velocity
before allowing a one hex side course change. How many hexes to travel may
depend on both maneuver gee and/or agility. Using this rule would make it
appropriate to limit the arc of the spinal mount to forward.
      Second, I want a planet\'s gravitational pull to interfere with a ship\'s
heading, depending on a ship\'s velocity and a planet\'s size and gravity (like
in Mayday.)
      I\'m working hard on these rules, but I must admit that my knowledge in
this area is limited. I have not been able to come up with any easy, user-
friendly rules. If you have any good suggestions, I would like to hear them.

DAMAGE RESULTS

      Fuel Tank. I\'m going to change the "fuel tank shattered" to "fuel leak".
A certain amount of fuel will be lost per turn. Subsequent hits will make the
leak more severe.

      Hull Inoperative. There is no effect in the standard rules (or my
variant) for an inoperative hull, when that damage level is reached. My
suggestions are:
      y restrict craft to 1G
      y prohibit atmosphere entry
      y hull is breached
      y stress severely limits heading changes
      y Agility drops to zero
      y may not fire spinal mount
      y Craft may not be recovered. They may be launched.
      y Rapid Launch Facilities are inoperative.
      y Fuel leak.

      I would like to have your reflections on these suggestions. If you have
any better solutions, I would like to hear them. I hope it will turn out to be
a good set of rules which make starship more interesting and realistic.

	Well, the pirates could get weapons from independant planets or 
small empires, in return for not hitting their merchants. The pirates
could get them through the black market. Pirates could also get them from
attacking and capturing warships. 
	Could merchants do the same? Yes. Would they want to? Probably not.
Having military weapons on a civilain ship should be a severe offense. The
lightest punishment would be at least a Cr100,000 fine and confiscation of the
weapons (and the ship would have to stay put until the weapons were stripped,
losing the merchant money). A moderate punishment would be confiscation of the
*ship*. Jail terms are seperate, and could range to the time it takes the 
government to strip the weapons to life in prison (possibly at a work camp).
	I don\'t think that a pirate ship should be that much of a match for an
equal tonnage warship. Not that they should be pushovers either, but a 400 ton
patrol crusier should be able to defeat a 400 ton corsair, and so on.
	A pirate ship should be a threat to a merchant, but not to a warship.

playing with the trade and commerce rules.  It finally occured to me
that the profit on freight should be close to the profit on cargo.  If
not, then these things are money machines (but not for the owners).  

I looked through my spinward marches data and found two planets that
looked good, Efate and Louzy (sp?) Efate is Hi In Louzy is Hi In Na
Po.  Efate has a type A starport.  Here\'s the plan: Go to Efate by a
whole lot of cargo (at 1000cr per ton 4000 base -1000 for Hi -1000 for
In -1000 for Type A starport.)  Ship this as freight to Louzy (and
book yourself a high passage) Sell.  Assuming you have broker-4 (why
not, it\'s not terribly hard using MT advanced merchant character
generation) this sells on average for 14,000cr hey, look, you made
12,000 clean profit per ton.  We\'ll assume you start with say 30000cr
in initial funds, that\'s enough to buy and ship 5 tons of cargo and
buy a high passage each way.  Afterwards you will have 70,000cr.  You
make money like gangbusters while the ships captain can\'t because the
Louzy-Efate run sucks, but you don\'t have to pay to maintain the ship
on the way back.

If however we raise the price of freight, this will go away.  As long
as freight isn\'t competetive with trade, people will be able to make
lots of money shipping goods as freight.  If everybody wanted to do
this, the price of freight would go up.

Seems easier to me to fix the trade and commerce rules than to hack
the spaceship rules to make only merchant ships cheaper....

A Telescopic scope may be placed on a handgun just as on a rifle with the 
same skill table as for range.  At TL 8 a laser projection scope may be 
used.  The primary advantage of the laser scope is that it doesn\'t require 
a phase delay to look through a scope when you make your shot.
 I have never created \'smartgun\' rules for using a personal HUD. It would 
be an obvious developement.  I will get right on it...

Steve Higginbotham commented that my numbers for 
Fuel Usage on a fusion rocket were sensible for
what we can forsee now, but not for what we can
do in 3000 years.  This is not strictly true.

There\'s only so much energy available when you
take four hydrogen atoms and make helium.
That energy is the top-end, 100% best that you\'ll
ever get out of a fusion rocket.  The corrected
numbers for TL9 fusion rockets I gave are running
a significant fraction (50ish percent, if I remember
my source material right) of that maximum limit.
Engineering only lets you get closer to that limit,
not to pass it....

is a whole lot more fun to work with 8-) ]

an off-the-wall AD&D character who was a wolf who had the power to

        That is why Steve once pointed out that the real profit will be
in shipping spec trade freight on someone else\'s ship, so no one would
build ships without some kind of subsidy, because you make less money
flying the ship and conducting spec trade than you do staying home and
sending it on someone else\'s ship.  In the Real World, freight prices
would go up until some kind of equity between supply and demand was
established.  In the Imperium, however... (see below).

        Except for one thing: based on the fixed prices in the game, and
other background information on how the Imperium fixes commerce to favor
itself and the megacorps, I assume that the freight & passenger prices
are fixed by Imperial Law.  
 
>Seems easier to me to fix the trade and commerce rules than to hack
>the spaceship rules to make only merchant ships cheaper....
        I like cheaper ships and low fixed commerce prices; other GMs 
might like expensive ships and variable (higher) commerce prices.  With
higher commerce costs and more expensive ships, the effect on your universe
will be to encourage worlds to be self-sufficient and to cut interstellar
traffic to a minimum.  Minimum would tend to be military and paramilitary 
and very high-priced commercial traffic to outposts that can\'t support 
themselves.  In such a case, commercial traffic will almost certainly be
in the hands of big corporations; very profitable, but not enough to go
around for the would-be free traders, even if they can afford to buy a
ship in the first place.  Not much room for PCs as free traders or 
others driving independent ships around space.  In fact, the picture looks
much like 2300AD, as far as interstellar traffic goes.
        With cheaper ships and variable commerce rates, which I mean to
try out come Hard Times, commerce rates for the established categories
(standard freight, high,middle,low passengers) will probably go up for
ships that are barely making a profit now, and come down for those that
are raking it in hand over fist.  I also plan on new, low-end categories
to appear: steerage -- more expensive than low berth, much less expensive
than middle passage -- but what you get is a bunk and a communal fresher.
I expect steerage to replace low berth, if low berths are no longer
required
by regulation, because low berth is the least profitable use of 0.5 tons
of ship space on the list.  With steerage, you don\'t need to pay a medic
to decant \'em, and you can cram in a *lot* more bunks than staterooms.
     With cheaper ships and low fixed prices, I think the picture remains 
the same as that assumed by most Traveller scenarios: lots of interstellar 
trade & traffic, lots of opportunities for PC shipowners.   Ships that 
can\'t make a profit under the fixed prices simply won\'t be built.

     Good point.  How about amending my rules to require 1 hardpoint per
range band beyond planetary for the longest ranged sensor array, booms et
al
same as before??  For example, if you had 
     ActEMS=Far Orbit, PassEMS=Substellar, ....
this sensor suite would require 5 hardpoints (or one boom) instead of 6.
 
Scott Kellogg also pointed out once that the folks at Challenge don\'t
appear
to "prep" their scenarios before publishing them.  Frankly, the MegaTrav
people at both GDW and Digest Group have provided ample evidence that they
have never heard of the term "blind play-testing" or don\'t know what it is
for if they have heard of it.  Since the publisher has failed to reality-
check (or sanity-check) his published scenarios, it behooves GMs to read
the
stuff with a VERY critical eye.  In the interests of TML GMs who don\'t have
time to pick apart that Challenge scenario with a fine-tooth comb before,
say, the weekend game, I am volunteering Steve to post some of his reviews
and analyses that he has been verbally relaying to me for the last ten 
years.  Bug him until he posts them.

     Mike, I presume you\'re talking about "Julian Protectorate" in
Challenge 49.
     You don\'t know how much it pleases me to hear someone express
appreciation for that.  It was really a labor of love.  Most of that
material was left over from Vilani & Vargr.  James Holden and I worked
closely in writing the Vargr side of that (although my credit was
overlooked...).
     I strongly agree with complaints about some of the slipshod
articles that get into Challenge.  Challenge was still a much
respected source of Traveller material when it transformed from JTAS,
but it declined quickly.
     In talking with others, at least those in HIWG, it seems likely
Challenge seldom gets quality Traveller material because they don\'t
print quality material.  People who really know their stuff and would
do it right loose their will to try because their work would just sit
along side trash.
     They need much tighter controls.  And if they\'re not getting what
they need, they should get the staff to fill the holes if nothing
else.
     Anyway, that\'s pretty much what we\'re having to do at IMPERIAL
LINES.  I\'m getting some good material, but I\'m having to do a lot of
the writing to keep the quality high.  I can\'t do that if we start
increasing the frequency or page count.  So I need submissions.
     For those of you not aware of this, IMPERIAL LINES is GDW\'s
Traveller newsletter.  We put it together for them; they print and
distribute it.  (I think the first issue is free.  You just have to
send a request.)  Issue #1 is out.  John Meyers just sent issue #2 to
GDW (or is about to).  This was our "Solomani & Aslan" issue, and I
think we really had our act together.
     Issue #3 will be "Vilani & Vargr". I have some left over material
for the Vilani side of Digest\'s V&V from Terry McInnes, and left over
Vargr material from your\'s truly.  But that\'s not enough. I encourage
queries.
     Issue #4 will probably be "Zhodani & Psionics."  I have two
people working on our first deck planned ship, the Noql class Zhodani
Frontier Trader (300 tons).  But that\'s the only bite I have.
     Issue #5 might be "Droyne and the Ancients."  But a year will
have past by that time. Fan feedback might well take us in a different
direction.
     We don\'t have any budget, so we can\'t pay you for your work.  But
if you\'re still interested, please write me at:

   Mike Mikesh; 3124 75th Avenue, #3; Landover, Maryland 20785-1920

Articles have to be short -- less than 1000 words.  We only have 8
pages to work with per issue at the moment.  Adventure ideas are what
I need most, like Random Nuggets, or 76 Patrons, or Lee\'s Guide.
Short discussion topics are good.  Use Twilight 2000 rules where you
can.
     Ships and vehicles ... maybe.  There is a ready supply of those.
What I\'d like to see are things that don\'t require unique circum-
stances to be encountered, yet are still interesting.
     I look forward to hearing from you.

E-Tek was the name of the company that sold "Personal Heads Up Battle
Field Display Technology".  It was really cool stuff dependending on
what tech level you bought the equipment at.  Characters tended to get
very nervous when they found out the heavies had E-Tek gear, much more
than if little red dots showed up over vital spots.  (Laser sights)

Tech 9 to 11:
	Bulky stuff, mostly good for attachment to combat armor and
	vac suits.  Cables connect to the weapon sight.  Sights tend
	to be \'mono-purpose\', either regular sights, infra-red, or
	light enhancement units.
Tech 12 to 13:
	Less bulky than previously.  Some units are equipped with
	radio rebroadcasters so that a command unit can watch over the
	platoon.  Still requires a helmet to be able to use; however,
	the helmet does not have to be connected to combat armor or a
	vac suit.  \'Multi-purpose\' sights sights are introduced, with
	a switch to change between regular sights, infra-red, and
	light enhancement mode.
Tech 14:
	Helmet is replaced with \'wrap-around sunglasses\' type display
	unit.  The user\'s body is used for transmitting the
	information between the weapon sight and the display.
	Additional electronics are added to optimize the display
	regardless of the light conditions.
Tech 15+:
	The helmet is completely replaced with contact lenses or
	optical implants depending upon the $$, tech level and whim of
	the referee.  Additional information can be obtained from
	battlefield computers, IFF data, grid location, range and
	distance, etc.

For additional cost and weight sighting capabilities can be obtained
for the next tech level bracket.  For example on a tech 10 planet you
could buy a rather bulky unit that has is switchable between regular
sights, infra-red or light enhancement mode.

Oh, you wanted prices and weights?  I have that somewhere.  It is
more than likely in the same place as my 4.3bsd release tape.

I need a better way to convert everything to online format.

Also not hostorically accurate. Things may change in the future (have
changed in the future??) but the military is a *very* conservative
group at least for the infantry. Troops are not equipped with the
most advanced weaponry available, though civilians tend to be.
Case in point: Your civial war, the Union and Confederate Soldiers
were mostly equipped with breech-loading (I believe) rifles, while the
civilians had repeating rifles available to them.

I know the discussion is concerning starships, but currently civilians
cannot aquire armed aircraft (which is the closest analogy to starships).
In the future I could see merchants/pirates having the latest weapon 
systems on their ships while the militray minds take 1TL to fully test and
try out the new weapons before making large commitments to installing them
on their fleets.

Last time I looked, energy available from fusion of four 
hydrogen atoms to one helium is on the order of 0.7% 
conversion, which gives a theoretical Isp of 3,660,000 
or so.  Which is a WHOLE LOT more than twice what you 
allowed, George...

Is this an _additional_ +2?  If not, why should I pay twice as much for

Same question.

Presumably, this reduces the bonus if you hold on target w/o firing...yes?
Otherwise, in a firefight I would fire as soon as I have a good target, which
might be half a second after target aquisition.  Is a half second enough
warning for someone in non-powered armor to move, given the delays of nerve
impulse propagation speed and the need to analyze incoming data, etc?

I can see the bonus reduction for powered armor because you could set an
automatic circuit to jump, (although that could be bad in certain
situations...) when it registers enemy laser sights.  However, if you are
relying on the operator to take action, you have the same problem of delay
while the wearer analyzes the data and decides on which direction to move.

     Well, the first war in this TCS PBEM seems to be off to a good
start.  As of now, everyone in the game should have heard about the
fighting, so it is a good time to talk about lessons learned in that
fighting to date.
 
 
     The first, and most obvious, lesson is that fighters, if used, need
to be big, tough, and expensive.  There have been three battles
involving fighters on both sides, and two others involving fighters on
only one side (you know who you are/were).  In every case, the weaker
fighters failed to accomplish ANYTHING against their opposite numbers,
while the good fighters wiped the floor with their opponents.  In all
three cases, the stronger fighters were fighting at long odds, and still
managed to inflict unacceptable casualties on their enemies.  
 
     In the two cases where fighters were only present on one side, the
fighters that were more technologically sophisticated than the heavies
on the other side (good show, New Home!) did quite well.  Where the
fighters were less well designed (that\'s you, Neubayern), they were
completely ineffective.
 
     And the factor most decisive in determining fighter effectiveness
was, of course, computer number.  New Home\'s model-7 computers beat up
on Sansterre\'s model-5\'s, which in turn beat up on Neubayern\'s
model-3\'s.
 
     Players not directly involved  might consider where their fighters
fit onto this chain, and redesign as necessary (yes, all you guys that
"Jane\'s" said had lousy fighters really did have lousy fighters!).
 
 
     Second lesson:  If you have a whole solar system to attack/defend,
then GDW\'s standard picture of the Imperium at war goes out the window. 
So far, defense of the gas giant has NEVER been a factor in any
engagement.  In all cases, attackers appeared at 100 diameters from the
main world, and ignored the existance of the gas giants.  In-flight
refueling capabilities have played a major part in all offensive
operations to date.
 
     And, defending gas giants is proving to be almost impossible
anyway.  After forces are deployed to protect the homeworld, and more
are sent out to carry the war to the enemy, it is becoming obvious that
a force deployed at the gas giant would either (1) be totally useless as
the enemy ignored the gas giant, or (2) be totally overwhelmed if the
enemy DID attack the gas giant.  
 
     If you choose to attack, and defend your homeworld, and defend your
gas giant(s), and defend your colony worlds, then you will disperse your
fleet into enough small pieces that even a weak enemy can overwhelm one
set of defenders at a time, and so trash your fleet in detail.
 
 
     Third lesson:  This one hit me totally out of left field (I
expected the first two from previous experience doing this).  It seems
that the presence/absence of meson technology makes a bigger difference
than I thought.  Conventional Wisdom (mine included) has it that a
battle-rider is more than a match for a battleship.  This seems to be
only true for meson armed fleets.
 
     In this game, so far, the ships have been armoured sufficiently to
prevent free critical hits from happening.  So the only damage done to
most ships before one side bugs out due to heavy losses is that the
maneuver drives and weapons are knocked out.  Jump drives and power
plants and computers are not being hit, due to armour sufficient to keep
out the interior explosions, and fib computers.
 
     When that happens, the battleships jump home for repairs.  The
riders left behind are captured and destroyed.  In all five cases, ships
have been disabled, but jumped to safety (even on the losing side).  The
winning side has then proceeded to capture/destroy all the riders left
disabled by the fleeing losers.  So the lost riders are being replaced
at a cost of billions and years, where the lost battleships/cruisers are
being repaired at trivial cost in a few weeks.
 
     This has not yet made a crucial difference, since the war has not
been going on for years yet.  But Sansterre\'s battleships have already
acquitted themselves well in THREE separate engagements, after having
been disabled in EACH engagement.  The same cannot be said for the
riders deployed by any of the sides so far.  In all cases, rider
casualties to the loser have been extremely high (near 100%), and the
winners have suffered the same fate for the riders as for their
battleships - they are recovered and repaired for use later this year. 
This is all very well if you can make sure you win EVERY fight your
riders are in, but it could get a lot tougher if you win a few, lose a
few.
 
     So it is fairly safe to say that in battles between fleets armed
with particle-beams and missiles (lasers/energy weapons are trivial so
far, just as they are in traditional Imperial doctrine) that the
jump-capable battleships and cruisers have a considerable long-term
advantage over the non-jump-capable riders.
 
TCS players:  read and heed this!  Your fleets may be on the line next.
 
Later...

Hi, I\'m the person who ran on at the mouth about mag bearings.  I\'m on
vacation right now, and probably won\'t be back on a computer until next
monday.  So...in the meantime, can you email me some more details on
what exactly you are thinking of?  In general, if you can take advantage
of gyroscopic effects, balancing becomes not hard at all.  Also, If you
want, you can float a rotating mass inside a mag field, and since it has
no physical restraints (vs mag forces), by filtering our the fundamental
frequency of rotation, it will balance about its center of inertia - which
may not be what you\'re after.  A rotoating mass balanced about its center
of inertia will hardly vibrate at all, where a rotating mass balanced 
about its geometric center (like those confined by mechanical bearings)
will be centered, but will vibrate more.  So which is more important to
you: a centered hub or a vibration free hub?  I don\'t think you can get
both and not violate physics as we know it now.

I\'m cross-posting this to the TML, by the way.

I look forward to hearing from you!

	If the attacker is snap-shooting, the laser sensors don\'t help.
For the person in non-powered armor, the sensors simply give a distinct warning 
beep. If you wish, you might want to make the character roll his dex or
less on 2d6 in order to get the modfier (sorry, MT people, I\'m not going
to define a task for this :-) ). Note that a person in non-powered armor
only reduces the LTS bonuses by 1 if the LTS is detected. The person will
probably move whatever direction he can -- low reaction time, unpredictable
enough that the firer can\'t completely compensate.

	Powered armor would probably have it set to automatically react,
though it could be overridden by the soldier in the armor. If using the
soldier\'s reactions, and not the powered armor\'s, there is only a -1 modifer.

Briefly, the magnetic flux through a superconductor has to remain constant,
which leads to what is known as the "Meissner effect".  If you move a 
magnet close to a superconductor, the superconductor will repel the magnet
as if it were a magnetic monopole of the opposite polarity.  There are two 
ways to make a maglev bearing: either take a superconducting shell or donut
and put a magnet in the center, or take a magnetic shell or donut and put
a superconductor in the center.  Take such a widget and put it in a vacuum,
and you have about as close to a frictionless bearing as you can get.

Granted, back in the days of olden piratery, merchant ships *were* heavily

Also, this seems to run contrary to most of the \'classic\' science fiction:

Sounds wrong? Thats what\'ll happen if merchants are armed better than warships.
The only way I can see most merchant craft being well-armed is if there is
such rampant piracy that the Navy can\'t handle it. You could, perhaps, get
the government to grant you papers to carry weapons, armor, and sensors
as good as the military, but then your ship would be classed as an auxillary
naval vessel, and could be pressed into service whenever the Navy needed it...

A note or two about the recent suggestions for weapon add-ons....

First off, I would argue that for gaming purposes as well as practicality
reasons, there should be stacking limits as to how many cumulative pluses
you can add to a gun, and furthermore that these pluses are capped by the
user\'s innate skill. Putting a laser sight AND HUD AND smartgun link AND
telescopic sight AND everything else on a gun eventually gets ridiculous.

Furthermore, Refs must be careful as to how much TL advancement they want
to allow in the development of these systems, before game balance goes 
straight out the window. In a recent game I ran, one character had an
integral smartgun link wired to a cybernetic enhancement of his own brain;
this allowed him (among other things) to sweep an auto-gauss-gun across
a crowd of people on full auto, scanning ahead of the barrel\'s trajectory
and momentarily interrupting the flow of hot lead as he passed over 
friendlies. Because the target acquisition, identification, calculation
of trajectory and fire interrupts were carried out in terms of machine
cycles (milliseconds at most), the overall effect was a two-second burst
from the gun, after which twenty perps dropped dead in the arms of six 
VERY confused PCs.

If one installs a robot brain in the gun itself (not an unreasonable
extension of the idea) then things get even tougher to manage. I
wasn\'t sure whether to be amused or upset when a visitor to our game
talked at great length about wanting to introduce such a system,
whereupon he described "Smith" and "Wesson" from BUCK GODOT, ZAP GUN
FOR HIRE (not what I\'d call Traveller-grade hard SF).

On the defensive side, a person in or out of armor about to be shot at
with a gun is not the same as a fighter plane about to be shot at with
a missile. Defensive alerts are idiotic--they add sensory distraction
without the hope of added defense. The point of armor is to stop
damage from getting through to the user, not to let him dodge bullets
and lasers (shades of STAR WARS!). Even if you could design an armor
suit that could sense and dodge for you, it\'d probably hamstring the
user in the process unless he plans to just lie there limply and let
the suit do the moving for him....

The advantages of these high-tech doodads are limited overall by the
person carrying the gun, and should be handled accordingly. I have no
trouble with a small aiming laser on ANY weapon above TL8; for $100
you can buy a real HeNe laser pointer the size of a pencil at any
Sharper Image store.  Mounting a telescopic sight or IR sight, or at
higher TLs a camera and HUD uplink, is also OK, but not in all cases:
a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and the best HUD system
is not going to let you snap-shoot any faster or hit a target beyond
the reasonable rated range of your gun. I subscribe to the KISS
principle: Keep It Simple Stupid. Laser pointers let you instantly
determine aim, and improve snapfire and aimed fire. HUD links help
aimed fire designate targets, but I dare someone to try to snap fire
AND use such a targeting system without becoming nauseous. (Think
about it: you\'re fast-drawing your gun and trying to get a sensible
picture from the camera mounted on the barrel, which is moving at an
enormous angular velocity? By the time you could focus you\'d be dead.)
This is especially important when people try to mount all of this
stuff on pistols. Common sense should rule all such things, and
weenies who insist on the latest cybertoys should be politely directed
to the Cyberpunk game going on in the next county.

A few days back, Steve and Hans mentioned the idea of using the Active EMS
or EMS Jammers as a cloaking device.  Well, sorry to get back to it so late,
but I just thought you might wanna know that this is (of course) impossible.

The hope would be that you could emmit an electro magnetic wave pattern
identical to the ships normal pattern but out of phase with it in such a
manner as to create a destructive interferance pattern.  Well, that is
I\'m afraid, just not possible.

There is an analogous short story by Arthur C. Clarke called "Silence, Please."
Which appears in "Tales From the White Hart" (Excellent stuff).  The idea
there is not EM radiation, but sound waves.  (Much easier to deal with.)
So, let\'s look at the problems with that.

In order to create such an interferance pattern, one would have to know, the
exact position of the listener (to within a wavelength of the sound in
question) as well as how they were moving to take doppler shift into account.
Now you might be able to do that for ONE observer, but if the observer moved,
even slightly, the effect would be lost.

I believe in some airliner designs they were talking about using speakers in
the cabin to make zones of destuctive interferance around passengers heads to
drown out the sound of the aircrafts engines (Unducted fans.)  The system was
going to block out just the sound of the engines.  However the silence zones
were only localized to the region of the passengers head.  There were speakers
placed in the chairs headrest.  But it was not possible to get the entire
fusilage of the plane to be such a zone.

Now, to attempt this with light, you might be able to fool one observer, BUT
you would have to know their EXACT position.  To within a wavelength of light,
ie down to nanometer acurracy.  You would have to know their EXACT speed
relative to you to account for doppler shift.  Now, with the ranges of space
combat being what they are, there is NO way you could know this.  And if you
did, you might as well fire your weapons, cause your sensor accuracy would 
have to be enough to count every cell in the pilot\'s body.

Furthermore, even if you did manage to fool their passive EMS like this, you
would still run afoul of their densiometers and neutrino sensors.  And there
is no way to spoof a neutrino sensor.  If you built a decoy drone to spoof it
you would have to install a similar size power plant in order to get it
to fool anyone.  (Several million credits for a decoy drone?)  Nope.

Yes, we have no cloaking devices.
We have no cloaking devices today.  :-)

My strategy for building fighters was to maximize bang/buck.  The smallest
missle fighters could have the highest G, cheapest, and could be grouped into
the highest factor ?9? squadron batteries the cheapest.

With low TL, energy weapons are much more expensive because of powerplant
costs.  And with Nuclear Dampers being allowed only at the lowest level,
nuclear warhead can pack quite a punch.

RE: Battleriders

How do Meson weapons make a difference?

I think a lot of Battlerider losses may have to do more with tactics.  In any
battle the losing side will take high losses, especially if there are not
provisions for rescuing survivors.  Admittedly, having fewer Jump Drives makes
fewer ships being able to flee on their own, but theoretically the battleriders
should be going onto battle outnumbering the other side because of
cost effectivness.  It helps to know when to pull out, too.

It\'s no surprise that computers make a big difference, once you are past a
minimal ship, there\'s no point in not putting the biggest computer in it.  If
it won\'t fit, make the ship bigger.  Since a computer adds both to defense and
offense, it make a big difference.

Is there any point in making a ship bigger then necessary to carry the biggest
spinal mount & biggest computer & 6G & highest armor, etc?

It makes no sense to me that Traveller does not allow multiple systems use, ie
multiple Maneuver drive, Power Plant, etc.

No.  If it out of phase here, it will still be so there, assuming that
the signal is an exact copy of the incoming.  And if you match the
wavelength incident where you are, the doppler shift will shift it
right along with the original signal you are trying to mask.

I hadn\'t heard of that one.  Sounds like a start in the right
direction, and I don\'t believe that 3000 years additional research
won\'t be able to come up with a better result.

Nonsense.  Are you suggesting that I have to know your exact position
for you to SEE me?  If you can see me, then I can flash a light in
your eyes.  And if the light were just so, then you wouldn\'t see me
any more.  If you assume (and you have so far) that the sensor arrays
are all over the hull, then you could get a pretty good copy by
generating a counter-signal at each point on the array to match
incident EM at that point.  It won\'t be perfect, by any means (unless
technology improves in 3500 years - a long shot, some people think),
but it will be better than letting them see you without even trying to
hide.

I never said we could spoof their densitometers and neutrino sensors. 
But Rob Dean pointed out recently (from TD #3?) that the operational
parameters for a densitometer were envisioned such that detection
range would be less than 5000Km.  And you can monkey with neutrino
sensors by EMMasking your ship, but not your drone, or by using a

}Hmmm... then why is GM talking about using it on cars in 1994? 

GM has Active EMS?  Wow!  TL 10 sensors in TL 6 cars!

}I also seem to recall seeing a news article on test operations in use
}today.  It didn\'t work real well with anything but low frequency
}stuff, but it did work.

This is all sound stuff.  By producing a destructive interferance pattern
in a confined box, (the muffler) it greatly reduces noise.

>There is an analogous short story by Arthur C. Clarke called
>"Silence, Please."  Which appears in "Tales From the White Hart"

}Yes, I\'ve read it.  Written in the late 40s-early 50s, right?  Before
}computers?

Correct, but computers won\'t solve the problem as presented there.

}No.  If it out of phase here, it will still be so there, assuming that
}the signal is an exact copy of the incoming.  And if you match the
}wavelength incident where you are, the doppler shift will shift it
}right along with the original signal you are trying to mask.

Ok, Light comes in and is reflected off the hull.  In order to be able to
destructively interfere with that reflection, you will have to know not only
the freqency of that light, but its polarization as well.  If you can\'t get
the polarization correct you won\'t be able to interfere with it at all.
Sunlight is randomly polarized.  There is no way to get it to match something
that is totally random.  But let\'s say for the moment that you do know the
polarization and the freqency.

You then pick up and measure each and every freqency of light coming in and
send it back out out of phase.  Now, observer A is travelling alongside the
ship at the same speed.  Observer B is approaching at some speed.  The ship
emmits light and disappears from view of observer A.  Observer B, however
sees the light that is reflected at it\'s normal freqency and the light that
is emmitted by the ship with it\'s freqency doppler shifted.  Thus, Observer A
can\'t see the ship, but Observer B can.

}I don\'t believe that 3000 years additional research
}won\'t be able to come up with a better result.

It can with nice long wavelengths and an unpolarized vibration like sound,
but not with light.

>Now, to attempt this with light, you might be able to fool one

>a wavelength of light, ie down to nanometer acurracy.

}Nonsense.  Are you suggesting that I have to know your exact position
}for you to SEE me?  If you can see me, then I can flash a light in
}your eyes.  And if the light were just so, then you wouldn\'t see me
}any more.  If you assume (and you have so far) that the sensor arrays
}are all over the hull, then you could get a pretty good copy by
}generating a counter-signal at each point on the array to match
}incident EM at that point.  It won\'t be perfect, by any means (unless
}technology improves in 3500 years - a long shot, some people think),
}but it will be better than letting them see you without even trying to
}hide.

You still have the problem of polarization.


}And you can monkey with neutrino
}sensors by EMMasking your ship, but not your drone, or by using a
}reaction that produces more neutrinos in the drone...

EM (electro magentic) masking takes care of EM radiation.  Not nuclear
radiation.  It will do absolutely nothing to neutrino emmissions.  And
as far as I know, neutrinos are only emmitted in certain nuclear reactions.
(fusion, and fission I believe)  Those would certainly be the easiest way
to get a source of neutrinos.  And fusion/fission plants are expensive.


}And I never suggested a cloaking device.  Hans inferred that.  I was
}suggesting something to make you ship HARDER to detect, not
}impossible.

Well, using the above technology might allow you to reduce your signature
somewhat, at least in terms of the amount of light your ship emmits.  You\'d
have to make certain all the freqencies and polarizations of your ship were
matched by your cloaking emmitters.  But it *might* be able to reduce your
emmitted signature.  It won\'t work against incident light, but maybe.
But then again, this sounds exactly like what the EMMasking is supposed to be
able to do.

Maybe what you\'ve been describing is the EMMask not EMS-Jam.  We never have
had *any* explanation as to how EM Masking is supposed to work.

If I remember right, Laser Sensors in Striker where used to activate Anti-
Laser Smoke to cover the vehicle.  Also detection of incoming laser 
targetig on a 3+ was only for High Tech Level setups, lower tech levels had 
higher rolls to make for detection.

Question:  Is a personal laser sensor a special suit that a person wears?  
I can understand laser sensors built into battle dress, or even combat 
armor.  Laser Sensors would need to cover a majority of the person\'s body 
for them to be effective, otherwise people would begin to target non-
sensor covered areas of the body.

I\'d be interested too, it might make for some fun reading.  Would it be
possible to post the \'old\' info from the game (i.e. the stuff everybody

ABSTRACT
     Variant starship combat rules. Fighters have more chance to knock out a
     battleship, but only if they are in large formations. Ships or fighters
     with armor-120 can now be damaged by weapons smaller than factor-T.



      This is a variant to the existing starship combat rules. I\'ll discuss
each segment of the combat rules separately with tables. These rules provide
fighters more chance to knock out a battleship, but only if they operate in
large formations.
      A fighter with factor-3 pulse lasers firing at a battleship with armor
of factor 100+ can just give up. There ins\'t any chance this puny craft can
make a dent in the hull. Even large formations don\'t have a chance.
      The rules work both ways. Nothing prevents one from creating a fighter
with armor-120 except for the cost. The fighter can still have a speed of 6G
and possibly some agility depending on armament. Such an armored fighter will
be nearly indestructible. A weapon of factor T+ is required to get a critical
hit against an armor factor of 120.

      To Hit. The to hit task is not changed - it works good enough as it is.
      Optional: Those who hate to roll each battery may roll once for all
bearing batteries. Subtract the difficulty value to hit from the roll, and
multiply the remainder by 10%. This indicates how many batteries hit.
      Example: The to hit task is Difficult, 11+. The attacker rolls 15.
      (15-11) * 10% = 40% of the batteries hit.
      When applying the 40% to the number of firing batteries, round up.

      Penetration. The penetration task is not changed.
      Optional: When using the optional to hit method discussed above, the
defender may combine the defensive batteries bearing. Find the ration of
offensive vs defensive batteries and consult the following table.

      Off/Def
      4:1 gives DM +3   Add the DMs given here to the attacker\'s
      3:1 gives DM +2   task roll. Ratios which exceed 4:1 or 1:4
      2:1 gives DM +1   are treated as 4:1 or 1:4 respectively.
      1:1 gives DM  0
      1:2 gives DM -1
      1:3 gives DM -2
      1:4 gives DM -3

      Use the same procedure as in the to hit task to determine how many
weapons penetrated. This precedure can be used against screens, but the ratio
DM from the table above is not included.
2. Damage Point Computation
      The component hit points computed during design evaluation are not used
in the current combat rules. This variant uses them.
      First, we will compute the damage points each type of weapons does.
      Turret mounted weapons do 10*UCP in damage. A bay weapon does 20*UCP in
damage. Spinal mounts do 100*UCP in damage.
      Nuclear and anti-matter do four times the precalculated damage. Example:
a UCP-3 turret firing nuclear missiles does 120 points of damage ((3*10)*4).

      Now we are going to compute how much beating each ship component before
the damage has an effect. The following examples use the Imperial Planet-class
Heavy Cruiser from Rebellion Sourcebook, using the corrected UCP available in
Clay Bush\'s HD 1703.

      Hull. To find out when the armor factor is reduced, divide the
inoperative value by the armor factor. The Planet has an inoperative hull
value of 67500 and an armor factor of 50. Each 1350 hits received reduce the
armor factor by one.
      There is a snag in that craft with high armor values will drop faster
than craft with low armor value. To negate this we will reduce received with
1% per armor value above 40. Also, damage is increased with one point for each
armor value below 40.
      Each time an interior hit is scored, apply half the hit damage to the
hull. If a shot penetrates armor, it will always give at least one damage
point to the hull.

      Power plant. Divide the inoperative number by ten to determine how many
hits the power plant can take before before losing 10% of its output. With
5140 points, the Planet takes 514 hits before power output is reduced 10%.
      For each 10% lost reduce the ship\'s agility by one.
      When 50% of the power plant has been lost, the spinal mount is
inoperative. The ship captain chooses either to maneuver or to fire energy
weapons (not both) in a turn.

      Manuever. Divide inoperative number by acceleration in G to determine
how many hits the maneuver plant can take before the maneuver G is reduced by
one. The 5063 hit points divided by 2G gives 2532 hits to reduce the rating by
one G. (The old system reduced acceleration by factors of one, two, or three.
With this system the maneuver plant will last longer.)
      Jump. As maneuver.
      Computer. I had trouble making damage plausible without being too
devastating. Weapons with a UCP of 1-4 give "Computer-1", UCP of 5-9 gives
"Computer-2", and UCP-A gives "Computer-3." On exceptional success reduce the
computer factor by an additional one. Radiation hits have no effect on fib
computers.
      Sensors. As computer hits.
      Weapons. As computer hits. If there is only one battery, reduce the
battery\'s UCP by the appropriate number.
      Screens. As weapon hits.
      Crew. One crew section is killed for each 100 damage points inflicted on
internal systems. A weapon which inflicts 80 damage points applies 40 to the
hull, and the remaining 40 kills one crew section. 120 points applied to crew
will kill two crew sections.

3. Applying Hits
      Hull. For internal hits, apply 50% of the damage points to the hull. If
the weapon does 100 damage points, apply 50 to the hull.
      Radiation hits. When a weapon which does radiation damage hits, apply
25% of the damage points to the radiation hit table. A factor-9 missile bay
firing nuclear missiles inflicts 720 damage points. If an internal hit is
scored, apply 360 points to the hull, 180 points to the radiation table, and
180 points to the internal explosions table.
      Critical hits. Per the standard rules. When the armor factor is reduced.
Remember to reduce the hull inoperative number in the process.
4. Armor Penetration Procedure

      Under the standard rules there is no hope that a low UCP weapon can
penetrate or do any kind of damage to a well-armored craft. In this variant
there is a slight chance that fighters and SDBs can dent the armor and
possibly scratch inside a battleship.

      To penetrate armor:
      Routine, Off=(weapon UCP/3), Def=((armor-40)/5), Confontration
      Referee: Meson guns do not roll this task. If they oenetrate
configuration, they just pass through the armor and explode inside.
      A natural 12 means automatic penetration of the armor. Drop fractions
when dividing weapon UCP and armor. Armor factors below 40 will give a DM in
the attcaker\'s favor.

- -      1    if black globe operating
      +1    if nuclear, anti-matter, or spinal mount weapon
Spinal mounts: as per standard rules, spinal mounts get one additional roll
      for each UCP factor above 9. Each roll inflicts UCP*100 damage points.

Black globes: A black globe absorbs a percentage of the damage value according
      to its flicker rate. A globe on 40% flicker absorbs 40% of all damage
      points before they take effect. Overload is by the standard rules.^L6. Exceptional Success
      For each point achieved above the required difficulty, add 10% to the
damage points inflicted by the weapon.
      Attacker rolls 13 (including DMs) for a weapon which inflicts 100 damage
points. Increase the damage points by 20% to 120 before black globe and damage
takes effect.
      [CRB: I think this applies to the to hit task. I disagree with
increasing damage for each point above the difficulty throw needed. A miss
inflicts no damage. Why should most hits inflict extra damage?]

7. Optional Sensor Rules
      Make all sensor tasks one level less difficult if the target is in an
adjacent hex.

      Make active sensor tasks one level more difficult:
      o if the target is within a gas giant, 
      o when attempted through a hex where a nuclear missile has exploded.
      o if target uses jamming.

      Neutrino detection:
      o If target\'s EMLevel is faint, give a -1 DM to neutrino scans.
      o If target\'s EMLevel is strong, give a +1 DM to neutrino scans.

      Densitometer detection:
      o If target is small, give a -1 DM to densitometer scans.
      o If target is large, give a +1 DM to densitometer scans.
      o Increase detection task difficulty by one level if detection is

                            ADDENDUM, 29 July, 1990

      My second draft on starship combat rules is near complete. There are
some rules I would like to get a second opinion on.

      Damage record. I have made a damage record form: boxes are crossed off
when damage is taken. MegaTraveller starships tend to have large damage
numbers, so I had to make a new system for hit points for each starship
component. Two reasons: I wouldn\'t get space for 500,000+ boxes on one A4
page, and lower numbers are easier to calculate.

      Time and distance. I plan to scale down the time and distance scale in
starship combat from 20 minutes/25000km to 4 minutes/5000km. For longer combat
turns, more damage must be given for each hit. With the reduced damage my
system does, I feel it is right to reduce the time and distance scale.
      This would make some planet\'s occupy two hexes. Hexes adjacent to a
planet are atmosphere hexes. If a ship is out of control and heading for
planet, it will burn up in the atmosphere.

      Hit and Penetrate. The most drastic changes will be the hit and
penetration tasks. I feel the task is either too difficult or too easy. So,
here is my change: I will do the tasks rolled on percentile dice (D100). Take
DMs from the tables in the Referee\'s Manual as usual.

      To Hit:
      Chance to hit: 30% * (1+(OffDM-DefDM/100))
      Example: A craft with factor-9 missile bay and computer model/9 firing
at a target with a DefDM of +7 will get a hit percentage of 33%:
      30% + (1+(8+9-7)/100)% = 33%

      To Penetrate Defense:
      Chance to penetrate: 30% (1+(OffDM-DefDM)/100)
      Example: The same ship as above is attempting to penetrate a factor-9
repulsor.  the defending ship has a model/9 computer. The total chance is 29%.
      30% + (1+(9-9-5)/100

      To Penetrate Armor:
      Chance to Penetrate: 30% *(1+((Weapon UCP-(ArmorValue-40))/100)
      Example: The same ship as above attempts to penetrate an armor factor of
60. The total chance is 27%.
      30% * (1+ ((9-(60-40))/100)

      Exceptional Success: Given when the roll is 1/10th under the required
roll. Example: if the base chance to hit is 33%, a roll of 01-03 indicates
exceptional success. A roll of 01 on the task is always treated as exceptional
success.

      Fleet or Ship Tactics: Add these skill points to the attacker\'s
offensive DM on the hit task. Follow the standard rules for how many tactical
points can be pulled from the pool.
    Firing arcs: Something that MegaTraveller ships should have is firing
arcs, but this is not possible as the design system is today.

      Movement: I am inclined to make some changes in the movement rules.
      First, I want to make heading changes somewhat more difficult. As in
Interceptor or Leviathan, it costs thrust points to change heading. What I
want to do is require a certain number of hexes travelled at a given velocity
before allowing a one hex side course change. How many hexes to travel may
depend on both maneuver gee and/or agility. Using this rule would make it
appropriate to limit the arc of the spinal mount to forward.
      Second, I want a planet\'s gravitational pull to interfere with a ship\'s
heading, depending on a ship\'s velocity and a planet\'s size and gravity (like
in Mayday.)
      I\'m working hard on these rules, but I must admit that my knowledge in
this area is limited. I have not been able to come up with any easy, user-
friendly rules. If you have any good suggestions, I would like to hear them.

DAMAGE RESULTS

      Fuel Tank. I\'m going to change the "fuel tank shattered" to "fuel leak".
A certain amount of fuel will be lost per turn. Subsequent hits will make the
leak more severe.

      Hull Inoperative. There is no effect in the standard rules (or my
variant) for an inoperative hull, when that damage level is reached. My
suggestions are:
      y restrict craft to 1G
      y prohibit atmosphere entry
      y hull is breached
      y stress severely limits heading changes
      y Agility drops to zero
      y may not fire spinal mount
      y Craft may not be recovered. They may be launched.
      y Rapid Launch Facilities are inoperative.
      y Fuel leak.

      I would like to have your reflections on these suggestions. If you have
any better solutions, I would like to hear them. I hope it will turn out to be
a good set of rules which make starship more interesting and realistic.

Ok, maybe we don\'t have the whole picture, (neutrinos won\'t fall under the
Grand Unified Field Theory though)

But we do have to try to make Trav stick to what physics we DO know without
having to resort to too many black boxes that mysteriously do things. 
Well,
at least *I* do.

Conceded.  I do too.  I also assume that what we know is the BEGINNING of
the
level of knowledge of Traveller (or any other future game), not the end of
it.

So, how do they detect them?  At TL15, they have a neutrino sensor that can
(presumably) detect a 10KW neutrino source at a range of a light second or
more.  Neutrinos are producd as a result of the interaction of VERY high
energy photons converting to positrons and electrons and then to lower
energy
photons and neutrinos (at least so the Navy Nuclear Power program said). 
This
happens to a small extent in fission and fusion, but neither fission nor
fusion produces enough neutrinos to make a MODERN (mutli ten-thousand
gallon)
neutrino detector show anything.  SO how is it done?  Obviously, if the
neutrino sensors in MT work, the technology of the period must have
SOMETHING
that can stop a neutrino with reasonable (50%? 10%? 90%?) certainty.  If
you
assume that neutrinos are unstoppable, then MT\'s neutrino sensors are
unworkable, and the problem of avoiding detection by them is moot.
 
As you may have noticed, I prefer working on the assumption that existing
elements of the game IMPLY the level of knowledge of the game universe.  I
only throw things out when they are IMPOSSIBLE.  And I don\'t define
impossible
by OUR level of knowledge today.  I don\'t like the "We can\'t do it, so it
can
never be done" attitude.
     Though why we are arguing about this I will never know, since I
consider
the subject silly, and you obviously do too.  Alas...

microwaves begin in the gigahertz region, this gives you 10e-9 seconds

smart-link shouldn\'t be cumlative, though you *could* make a smart-link with

light-intensification or thermal sights (yet).

For a potent sighting system, see the battlefield sight on the gauss rifle
(Book 4: Mercenary). It probably doesn\'t weight over 1kg, but would account for
half the cost of the weapon.

For the laser sensors, I really only had in mind sealed armor (battle dress, 
combat armor). The sensors would probably not be very effective on \'normal\'
armor (cloth, ablat). If the idea of a beep bothers you, what about a female 
voice saying \'laser\'?

I do like the idea of the sensors automatically setting off anti-laser
aerosols. A suit of combat armor or battle dress probably couldn\'t fit more
than a half-dozen cans/uses on the suit without being rediculous, but you
would end up negating *all* the laser bonuses.

Nuc dampers do the strong force only, but a strongly focused gravity

That\'s the name of the exercise: explain what they did in some
sensible way.  There\'s no point in saying it isn\'t possible (unless
you plan to start playing a different game), but there is much karmic
benefit to figuring out how it could be done (and politely assuming

The Near Star List gives its coordinates as X -28.4, Y 19.8, Z 32.1. 
It\'s on the map on the back cover, about an inch and a half above Xi 
Ursae Majoris.  That does imply that the Pentapods have pretty extensive 
star-faring culture. A visit would be very interesting.

well, it certainly was beyond the scope of a map last time I looked 
it up in the catalog.  Typo?
And I am moderately certain, based on other descriptions in CHallenges
and other places that humans have never gone to the P-pod homeworld, 
or even very far into P-pod space.  I gather that after the P-pods were
encountered, human exploration in that direction stopped cold, and hasn\'t
moved since.

There really isn\'t much EVERYONE has seen.  Lots of message traffic 
(mostly secret), and movement orders (likewise).  After the first 
year passes, I will post a summary, for those who are interested.  And
anyone (except players) who want an unedited version of the message 
traffic to/from a particular (or all) system(s) is welcome to it.
 
I will send along a description of the Battles AFTER an armistice is 
signed (no need to give out free intell to one of the participants).

     We do that NOW with STEALTH technology.  Take a close look at the two
different (but both effective) approaches used by the F-117A and YF-22 & 
YF-23 Advanced Tactical Fighters.  As usual, Traveller falls behind reality
in ignoring Stealth, which reduces PASSIVE signature, not active.

interrupter gear.  TL 5 technology.  I rather like the idea presented

weapon technology might be able to do.

     Yep.  An idiot with the power of a god is still an idiot, to badly
paraphrase a certain Amber character.  I find a high Tactics skill is far
more important than any amount of technology; a clever player with a
body pistol is more dangerous than an idiot with an FGMP (to his 
enemies, I mean).

     But Mike, the weenies don\'t want to be in the Cyberpunk game where 
all their enemies are just as heavily armed... that would be dangerous.
See Rule #1 above.
     Seriously, I do *NOT* understand this prejudice against realistic
cybertechnology -- yes, *realistic*.  The cyber/computer technology 
depicted in "cyberpunk" and other near-future science fiction is the most
likely and realistic technology I\'ve seen yet in Traveller -- so you
dislike that and prefer jump drives/gravitics instead?  Or computers 
obsolete by 1990\'s standards?  I are confused...
     Caveat: I don\'t necessarily believe that the *social* milieu depicted
by some cyberpunk stories is realistic -- then I look at places like
Los Angeles and the former Eastern Block and think again.

     Uh, there seems to be some confusion as to what a smart-link is.  A
smart-link is the wire and circuitry that allows the electronics in your
gun (ie, the sights and trigger) to interface either with your brain thru
a neural jack, or your battlesuit combat computer if you are playing it
that way.  Which is to say, if your weapon is high enough TL to have 
electronics rather than merely mechanical sights and trigger, it can 
have smart-link capability built in with no extra size or weight penalty.
Of course the telescopic sight/laser-sight and smart-link are cumulative; 
the smart-link is useless without some kind of sight to provide targetting
data... I *would* go into LI/IR sights -- a natural for a smart-link.

True.  Which is why we\'ve only seen a handful in passing for all our

GDW probably doesn\'t employ anyone who knows what a neutrino is.  They
probably think it is another word for neutron.  

But let\'s be nice.  Let\'s PRETEND we believe GDW is filled with bright
technophilic young men (and women, mustn\'t forget them).  Instead of
admitting that they seem to be survivors from the early sixties, who
haven\'t yet caught up on the latest technological developments.  

Later...

Such a device already exists in the game.  It\'s called a black globe.

If this is, seriously, your Rule #1, Cynthia, then regardless of your
impressive achievements here on the TML I have just lost any and all 
respect for you as a member of the Traveller community. You are preaching
the worst kind of ear-rot there is, and it makes my stomach turn.

What is your sin? Making rules to deal, within the context of the
game, with players whose actions may prove disruptive or
counterproductive.  This is not, as you might benightedly think, a
necessary and constructive sign of a good, conscientious Referee: it
is the eternal stamp of the muddled, muddling amateur, and one that I
shed myself only a few short years ago, after over a decade of making
myself miserable doing what I was SUPPOSED to be enjoying, i.e.
running Traveller games.

Note that this is NOT about technology, it is a much larger issue.
You can, and do, argue that from a game technology standpoint giving
people access to hellish weapons of instant destruction is reasonable,
viz.:

On the face of it, this statement is totally reasonable. I live and
play my SF RPGs by it, and so do many others. In concert with your
Rule #1, though, it is the stroke of Doom for a worthwhile game. 

My suggestion that technology be limited was, in essence, a timid
attempt to avoid this posting by skirting the reasonable point you
make about the availability of technology. It failed, because what you
just said above was inarguable. Now, though, I\'m forced to say
something much more difficult, because of that FIRST piece of your
hraka I quoted.

(At this point, you\'re all scratching your heads and wondering if 
The Man has finally gone off the deep end. Perhaps; doctoral theses
can do that to you. But there is a point to all this. Bear with me.)

(It is also possible, even highly PROBABLE, that the initial statement
made by Cynthia WAS in fact made in jest (at least partially), which 
makes my initial disclaimer twice as important, lest I lose a good
friend. However, I shall press on, for my point is the most important
one I have ever made on the TML, or WILL ever make, and there are 
those who MUST hear it. Bear with me.)

(This tends to reinforce my feeling that Cynthia was kidding. Well and
good; I was worried there for a second. It also, however, demonstrates
that she remains ignorant of the true problem. Onward!)

What you have failed utterly to consider, in your mad rush toward
technic Nirvana, is the metagaming aspect of the availability of such
technology.  Not just what the characters become capable of, but what
the PLAYERS realize the characters become capable of. The bridge
between real live person, with limitations of various sorts, and
paper-and-dice construct, with DIFFERENT limitations, of various
sorts. And how all of this fits in with the vision of the game, from a
standpoint of both knowledge and intent.

Forget the rules. Forget the UNIVERSE! THIS is what is important;
all else is expensive, slick window dressing that doesn\'t mean spit:

What are we doing here? We are playing Traveller.

What is Traveller? Traveller is a role-playing game.

What is a role-playing game? A game in which people create artificial 
personae to interact in a fictional universe in an attempt to gain 
various goals (that\'s the "role-playing" part) and enjoy themselves 
in the process (that\'s the "game" part).

Role-playing. Game. This and nothing else is the core of the matter.

When we do this, we are engaging in a constructive, cooperative effort
to solve a problem of some sort. We encourage one another; we face setbacks
together, we suffer together, sometimes we die, sometimes we triumph.
It is not the Satanist hogwash the media paint it as; it is perhaps the
most healthy and uplifting form of recreation ever invented by Man. It
HEALS! Psychologists know this, and have for years or decades. It is,
ultimately, GOOD for us.

Unless we do things YOUR way. With Rules like #1. Observe and learn:

When a group of people get together to game, players and ref,
regardless of the rules system or the circumstances, they do so to
enjoy each other\'s company and to explore a world of fantasy and
wonder, TOGETHER. We have all experienced times when the entire 
group, even when the CHARACTERS were in conflict, moved and thought
in a wondrous harmony, and the game "clicked." It WORKED. 

We have also, alas, experienced times when it didn\'t. Sometimes only
on occasion, and sometimes chronically. And when the problem becomes
chronic, we have often, in our inexperience and ignorance, attempted
to band-aid the problem with Rules.

Bad move.

There is only one Rule that counts in a role-playing game: THOU SHALT
GET ALONG WITH THY REF AND FELLOW PLAYERS. No exceptions, no fixes to
the rules to prevent abuses, no nothing. You go with the program or
you LEAVE.

The Rule you suggest is designed to prevent abuses by players of the
tremendous technology that futuristic games offer, or for that matter
the magic and nifty weapons that float around most fantasy games.  It
implies one of two possibilities: either there is a player or two who
is always looking for a crowbar to wedge open a bit more of an
advantage over the NPCs (and often, tacitly, the other players), orr a
situation in which the players have one vision and the Ref another.

This should not be confused with what arises from IGNORANCE of the
game framework, it is a matter of INTENT. The Rules are stapled into
place to prevent things from getting out of hand; the Ref throws up
obstacles, technicalities, threats, to hold down the players, and they
respond with ever more clever and devious means of escalation.  Their
fun is malicious; the Ref, often, stops having fun at all. The game
goes on, but people wonder why it doesn\'t zing any more.

The reason is lack of shared vision.

(What a positively revolting thought.)

"But wait," you say, "You provided the technology for this massacre."

True.  In my game, in this circumstance, the technology was there at
the start, and the player and his character knew it. It was understood
that gunplay was damned dangerous, and the sooner and cleaner it was
over, the better.  This character was set up with the stated intent of
finishing violent situations before any PCs could get hurt. He did so
with alacrity but with no sadism or joy, and he runs his character in
such a way as to assure that such situations are AVOIDED whenever
possible. In short, he is incredibly dangerous, but his character
WORKS because he shares the vision of a nonviolent, brain-intensive 
game with his Referee (moi) and the other players (none of whom have,
or wanted to have, dangerous fighters).

I am going to save you all the years of agony I went through, trying
to jump through hoops to please everyone in a game at once when certain
players were being uniform pains in the butt, so listen carefully:

Just say NO.

You\'re not stupid; you can tell the difference between a character
who\'s a pain because it\'s the player\'s PLACE in the GAME to be a pain
(what\'s a party without conflict?) and a character who\'s a pain
because the player is a pain, period. You can tell the difference
between a player who\'s having a bad night and one who\'s just plain
impossible. This is not generalizable! A fellow who is a total BLAST
in a high-level Runequest game may be a total BUMMER in a Traveller
campaign; people who are uniformly impossible are, thankfully, a
minority.

>      Hey! I liked Buck Godot!

So did I, but it WASN\'T Traveller. It was Bureau 13, which is FINE, or
maybe Star Wars, but it wasn\'t Traveller. The mindset is different.

This is a vital subpoint to the one about shared vision: Different
games, and different universes, require different mindsets. You don\'t
play Traveller the way you play AD&D, or Bureau 13, or Paranoia, or
Runequest. They all have different "feels" to them, and must be
treated accordingly. The vision changes, and the people must change
with it. It all ties together that way in the end.

(Ultimately, this is the core of my disclaimer: I cannot force the
mindset of my Traveller universe on others, and unlike games like
Paranoia or Teenagers from Outer Space or Toon, the mindset in
Traveller is open to interpretation. There are people out there who
revel in the kind of mindless garbage that I avoid with all haste, and
enjoy themselves in doing so. To them, then, this entire diatribe may
seem pointless and out of place, but it is equally important to them
as to me, because THEY must retain THEIR vision as I retain mine.)

So, we have defined the problem: lack of shared vision. What\'s the fix?

Just say NO. In the most forceful, inarguable way you can: throw the
offenders OUT. You\'re NOT doing yourself or them a favor by keeping
them in a game and messing with rules and caveats to keep them in
line; you\'re tacitly encouraging their behavior and ruining things for
the other players....and for yourself, oftentimes. If they\'re really
friends, they\'ll understand and show up for a different campaign in a
different game with a different Ref, if that\'s what it takes. If they
are so mortally offended by the fact that you can\'t deal with them
that they refuse to have anything to do with you thereafter, guess
what?  You just WON, BIGTIME, because they\'re out of your HAIR! You
can go back to enjoying the game again! No need for Rules-- you\'ve
eliminated why they were there in the first place! 

And if it\'s the whole party against the Ref? Well, two possibilities:
one is that they\'re all jerks, the other is that their shared vision
clashes with yours. The solution to both problems is the same: STOP
THE GAME IMMEDIATELY. Then you either start a new game in keeping with
their vision, if it\'s one you COULD share if you knew of it from the
start... or go find a new game group.  And don\'t give me that whining
about how tough it is to find groups these days! That\'s horseshit.
There are bazillions of people looking for Refs; you just have to find
a set that click with your needs.  Playing with people who DON\'T is
worse than not playing at all. Believe me, I know.

If you love Traveller as a world-conquering shoot-em-up game, and 
your players do as well, GO FORTH AND SHED BLOOD! Don\'t let an old
fart like me spoil your fun-- IF IT *IS* FUN TO YOU. I like running
games of this sort myself every once in a while (once per four years
seems to be about right), but I DON\'T use Traveller for it. It\'s
not right for me. But if it IS right for you, AND for your players,
then go to it. 

BUT.....

If you are the referee of a game, and you establish a certain mindset,
then it behooves you to insure that your players understand and agree
with that mindset, AT THE START. If they do not, you must either learn
what they want and change accordingly, if you can do so without
compromising your own vision, or change games, or eject them. Some or
all. If your vision is clouded, you CANNOT run a good game.

In closing, I quote Cynthia one last time:

>      Yep.  An idiot with the power of a god is still an idiot [...]

And a referee who makes rules to circumvent player conflict rather than
cutting it away like the cancer it is, IS the prime example of an idiot
with the power of a god. I have no sympathy for these people; they 
deserve none. They have created their own private Hells.

Here endeth the lesson. Go, and tolerate fools no more.

(And before anyone asks: yes, I *DO* practice what I preach. Ask any
of the thirty or forty people with whom I had long-standing gaming 
associations whom I\'ll no longer run in Traveller games because they
were good D&D players and ONLY good as D&D players....)

(And before anyone asks: No, I do not apply this ruling to the PBEM,
although I\'d dearly love to sometimes. Why not? That\'s not for
public discussion.)

Thanks for your tolerance of my howling. I hope I was able to teach
SOMEONE something useful with it; it\'d be a drag if Cynthia stopped
talking to me for nothing. |-\\

JUMP SPACE MECHANICS

Ok, I\'ll bite...  I certainly won\'t argue over the problems with
gravitics and computers in Traveller.  On the other hand, I could
write an equation for "jump space mechanics" where the energy event of
jump space insertion allows the ship to travel through "complex" space
(described mathematically as Riemannian space).  Reintroduction into
"real" space at one\'s destination can be described as "popping"
through a Reimann surface at a singularity (satisfying the boundary
conditions of the yet unwritten differential equation of jump travel
arbitrarily).  Misjumps?  Well, bad insertions could be used as
initial boundary conditions for travel through Reimannian space, thus
skewing the "solution" of the differential and the final time/place of
arrival.

On the other hand, I\'ve never cared for lanthium grid technology...

     < Warning - nerd attack: The above "jump space mechanics" are
       modelled on the REAL WORLD solution for the arrival of Love 
       and Rayleigh waves in a teleseismic event, where the energy
       event (ie, a big earthquake) happens in real mathematical space, 
       the displacements travel in complex mathematical space <some 
       of which are entirely imaginary...>, and arrivals happen at 
       singularities when the wave train "pops" through a Riemann 
       surface back into exclusively REAL space...  Helmberger at the 
       Seismic Lab at Caltech did the mathematics in the late 60\'s - 
       truly grusome stuff, makes great reading late at night if you 
       want to be put to sleep... >

COMPUTER-TO-PERSON DIRECT INTERFACING

This has always been one of the two things in cyberpunk that I\'ve
always had the most trouble with.  I have no confidence, based on what
I know (which isn\'t that much, admittedly), that near-future
technology can support computer to person direct interfacing.  I just
don\'t think "jacking-in" is possible.

It turns out from what people have learned from PET scanning of the
human brain that smart people are effecient thinkers (low PET
emissions during problem solving), and not-so-smart people are
wasteful thinkers (high PET emissions during problem-solving).  In
addition, we know that memory retrieval is probably a tree search, and
we also know where different functions occur in the brain more or
less.

We know that synapses pass electro-chemical signals through the brain,
and that there are several different emzymes that act essentially as
bio-resisters, bio-transitors and bio-capacitors along synapse paths.
We also know that there is an upper limit on the SPEED, ie the
electric current, along the synaptical pathways.  Last, we know that
the brain is self-wiring, and that the virtual wiring in every brain
is different.  (Remember, the brain is a really cool organ - after
brain damage which isn\'t too severe, the brain can relearn and rewire
most of its functionality along new paths - which is why stroke
victims are often able to relearn talking and walking...)  The basic
ROM "instruction set" on "wiring" is stored in chromosomes at the cell
level, which is to say that an analog computer is probably a better
model for the hardware/software or the brain that a digital
computer...  Neural input/output is analog - think about hand/eye
coordination, for example.

So, smart thinking is efficient, but along pathways which have an
upper limit on speed, and which can\'t be described because their
specific location is unknowable (because of the self-wiring nature of
the brain).  Given those constraints, I personally find it hard to
believe that a near-future biomed engineer will be able to design the
sort of interface described in the cyberpunk genre books for
"jacking-in", mostly because of the dynamic and unique virtual wiring
property of individual brains.

So given that the hardware/software system is DYNAMIC, how can you
make a jack (which will be fixed in space) that can interface with a
self-rewiring analog biochemical processor whose instruction set has
no knowledge of the world beyond the cellular level???  I don\'t think
it can be done (personal opinion).

Mind you, I only have the sort of "knowledge" on bioscience that comes
from reading Scientific American and Science News.  This isn\'t to say
that I\'m inflexible in my opinion; but I\'ve thought about this a bit,
and I made conclusions on what I think I know.  I\'m willing to be
convinced otherwise if one of the smart-link, chipping-in, and/or
jacking-in proponents can propose a plausible means by which
computer/brain interfacing can be achieved.

OK, end of rant...  You can take out your smart guns for pot shots at
me now...

As I am the only person in my traveller group with an internet
account, I\'ve been making hard copy of the nightly mailing and taking
it over to where I game one to two times a week.  There the hard copy
is snatched up and read...  We\'ve been working our ways slowly through
the bundles also.  (Thanks Bob Dean, for getting me directions to this
list...  you\'ve made a whole bunch of old traveller junkies pretty
happy...)

My GM asked me to post the message below.  If you have any replies for
Jim, you can send them to me, and I can get them to him.  The turn
around time for Jim to reply to items posted on this list is slow, so
as you will see below, he will be responding sometimes to subjects a
few weeks old.

********************* begin included message **************************

Hello out there. I\'m an MT GM over in the East Bay Area ( Why yes, we
Californians so think that there is only one Bay Area |-) )  I\'m
Writing this to say Hi, and to talk about one of my favorite games!
One of my players is on this mailing list and if you\'re reading this,
she has consented to send this set of rambilings out. I did look at
the Rouge generation and I don\'t think it\'s too complicated at all;
and if anyone of my players want to use it for a character, I\'d be
happy to see it.

Speaking of characters, my wife has two that are a new race -
Racoonids!  We are thinking of sending them to the Challenge as an
article on a new race - if you people would be interested let us know.

I run a game that is pretty free form but has a lot of role playing. I
like my people to be happy with their characters. I was looking at
some comments about Career changes - I liked the Idea of DM modes
based on time in the old career but allowing the use of brownee points
on the enlistment. Good idea !!

We have one character in our game who changed careers at the start of
the campaign.  She was a Cop who rose to Police Commissoner ( also
became a Baroness |-)) She was selected by a certain Duke to be the
mission commander for a group of very strange characters. On eof her
favorite comments ( when no one is listening! |-)) is " I\'ll get you
for this Norris!!!!"  She is riding herd on the Nail mission (the one
from the Rebellion book) Her #1 is an Aslan Male (if he couldn\'t
command, he might accept #1...) The next is a retired (so she
thought...) Navy Commodore who thought very little of putting an EX
COP in command!!!

There are some very strange people on this crew - even the humans have
communication difficulties ( you are a product of your culture you
know... |-) )

Maybe we\'ll post some of the stories to the list if anyone is
interested out there. it\'s been a grand time!! how about the time M.C.
shot up her stateroom wall! or the time Thilea fell in on Sean... We
have a lot of role playing and not to many fire fights ( those are
dangerous - you can get HURT that way!!! ) and only one bar fight
(some of the charcters didn\'t like it one bit and are not going to get
in another if they have any say in the matter...).

What is up in the MT world ? I keep reading that DGP is not doing MT 
any more and that GDW is coming out with (YET) another revision of 
Traveller. I don\'t know how many more I can stand as I bought the 
original books and resisted the change until I got a real good look at 
MT and they had had time to get most of the Errata |-) done!!

I think that I\'ve run on probably too long now so I\'ll return you to 
your original sender!

Starports

Who owns them on a planet ????? I read somwhere that the starport
was imperial territory on planets . What do people think ?????

My version is like this . 

All starport territory (the land) is owned by the imperial government . 
It in turn leases this land out to various coorporations who set up
the starport (for a nominal fee) . Thus in theory the starport is imperial
territory . The security in a starport would be imperial marines I guess
.. Thus somebody could enter a starport and be in an \'exclusion\' zone . Of
course there would be extradition (but with a \'undemocratic\' government
benign buearacrats could put alot of red tape in the way) . 

The problem with this view is that the planets government might be
a tad resentful that their planets starport is run like this . 

The situation is a bit like Shanghi in China before the outbreak
of the second world war . The port was run jointly by france, england
and I think america . Most of the city was chinease but the port area
was run by the govts who had troops stationed at the \'border\' with 
checkpoints and the like . People had to have the neccessary papers 
to cross between the areas . When the japanese invaded, these 
govts still controlled the exclusion zone. 

I would really like to know others views and comments on this
(cause I am going to use em in the next adventure) . 

What do you think

Mike Metlay says:
{Even in the midst of thesis defense, he finds time to write}
{Sorry I quoted so much, but it seemed important}

:Forget the rules. Forget the UNIVERSE! THIS is what is important;
:all else is expensive, slick window dressing that doesn\'t mean spit:
:...
:Role-playing. Game. This and nothing else is the core of the matter.
:...
:We have all experienced times when the entire 
:group, even when the CHARACTERS were in conflict, moved and thought
:in a wondrous harmony, and the game "clicked." It WORKED. 
:
:We have also, alas, experienced times when it didn\'t. Sometimes only
:on occasion, and sometimes chronically. And when the problem becomes
:chronic, we have often, in our inexperience and ignorance, attempted
:to band-aid the problem with Rules.
:
:Bad move.

If only politicians would learn this about real life.  Not so far removed
from fantasy, I guess.


:There is only one Rule that counts in a role-playing game: THOU SHALT
:GET ALONG WITH THY REF AND FELLOW PLAYERS. No exceptions, no fixes to
:the rules to prevent abuses, no nothing. You go with the program or
:you LEAVE.

Why does this sound so remeniscent of the first and second (Judaic)
commandments?  

Which is MY main point about GM\'ing--Don\'t take it too seriously.
So often we see people who need to get a life and stop treating the 
game like it was actuually important to them.  If it *really* is 
that important, this player needs professional counseling, not the
kind of inner search work that comes from role-playing.  Very few
of us here have the skills and training needed to keep that (fortunately
very) rare individual from losing touch with our common fantasy
altogether.

So, as Mike says:

:Here endeth the lesson. Go, and tolerate fools no more.

:(And before anyone asks: No, I do not apply this ruling to the PBEM,
:although I\'d dearly love to sometimes. Why not? That\'s not for
:public discussion.)

Except it\'s mainly my fault.  and I\'ll publicly admit THAT much...

rest of your tirade.
 
     I have played Traveller ever since it came out, under a variety
of GMs (mostly good.  Bad GMs seem to stick to D&D).  I have NEVER
seen a relationship between good roleplaying (or lack of it) and
weaponry (or lack of it).  The two are about as closely related as
rockets and crabs.
 
     The only point I get from your tirade is either that:
 
          1) requiring internal consistency is bad, or
 
          2) allowing bad guys to have a fighting chance is bad.
 
     Neither assumption really makes sense.  The assumption that doing
either of these things somehow enhances group play makes no sense
either.  The assumption that you cannot be playing the game right
unless you follow these "guidelines" makes no sense, either.
 
     Having played Traveller for many years (and many other
roleplaying games during the same period), I have noticed that the
ONLY time firepower affects playing style is when the PCs have it, and
the NPCs don\'t.  Otherwise, whether the available firepower is clubs
or FGMPs seems to make little difference.  FYI, in Cynthia\'s games, my
character(s) have used guns four times in the last two years:  once to
shoot a couple of large carnivores trying to eat my cattle, once to
break up a bank robbery, once to ambush some pirates, and once to stop
a lunatic from killing my character.  In none of those cases did my
level of firepower affect my decision to use force, and in only one
would a lack of firepower have convinced me not to (I would have let
the carnivores kill my cows, since I have no desire to be eaten by a
four-ton meatgrinder on legs).
 
     Digression!
 
     Back to the main point.  Mike, do you really believe that being
internally consistent is bad from a "role-playing" standpoint?  Have I
just lost any respect I might have had for you?
 
     Rule #1, as Cynthia described it, is my rule #1.  It can best be
translated as:
 
     "The only advantage you have over ANYONE else is your mind, and
it\'s contents.  They can, and will, use everything the universe allows
to accomplish their goals, just as (presumably) you will.  In other
words, if you can\'t outthink them, don\'t bet on being able to outshoot
them."
 
     If this assumption is wrong, then I have indeed missed the boat
in roleplaying.  But I suspect that allowing the PCs to get their
hands on "terror-weapons" while forbidding the NPCs to do so is worse,
and I don\'t think I will EVER allow such in any game I play in, even
if the PC(s) are nice guys who would never use those same
"terror-weapons".
 
Later...

Hi all! Just a little question regarding tiny nuclear detonations.
Say that you have a 0.1 Kiloton warhead go boom at sea level on
the surface of an ocean. The first thing I want to know is whether
of not you agree with the blast radius given by Striker rules
(no damage beyond 300 meters, if I\'m reading this correctly).
The second thing I\'m wondering about is, how high in TL would you
have to go before you could squeeze the bomb (detonation equipment,
shielding, and nuclear material) into the space of... roughly...
a soccer ball (or football for those of you outside the United
States)? The third thing I want to know is, how far away, roughly,
could the average person hear the "little boom"? And fourth,
would the waves generated by this critter pose a significant
hazard to costal populations which are more than five or ten
miles from ground zero? Finally, could a reliable nuke be made
at the 0.01 - 0.001 range in order to deliver a little bang
(say to completely destroy a city block with something the size
of a grapefruit)? Just wondering out loud. It\'s for the
Harrison Chapters, of course. Muchos thanx in advance...

Um... yes, but we are very fortunate to have, at our disposal, several major 
NERVES that connect the senses from the disparate parts of the body TO the 
brain.... Tap into those and you are in business.. This makes sensory perception
enhancement much more feasible, but makes such things as enhanced consciousness 
(the computer actually FUSES with the brain to have faster memory, heightened
intelligence, etc. is well nigh impossible (even though I WILL NOT take the 
extra step to say that it IS impossible)) If computer enhanced intelligence does
exist in the future, it probably will be in the form of a \'small voice talking
in your ear\' privvy to the data that is coming into the brain, and able to make
separate decisions about such data, then commuting that data TO you. In other
words, a dialog.

	About the problem of analog -- 1) it is only half correct.  Action 
potentials are PARTIALLY analog. They either are firing or they don\'t -- in that
sense they are digital. However, they also have limits to firing, sometimes fire
in weakened way (if overburdened by too much activity) and sometimes cannot fire
at all (if in a resting state) In addition, neurons have a partial ability to 
LEARN from prior firings. The reason why you haven\'t gone crazy because of the
sensation of your clothes on your skin is because the neurons have ADAPTED to 
this sensation, and do not fire because of it.
	Anyhow, the whole paragraph above is moot, because a transform can be 
made from analog to digital, as evidenced by CD players. I am not too familiar
with the mechanics of this, but it is certainly NOT an impassible block as far
as Cyber technology is concerned....

Curious as to what you think,

Think of a 100 kilogram iron bomb.  That\'s about 220 pounds.  Smaller than
the bombs dropped by B-17\'s in World War II.  Not big enough to cause wide
scale destruction.  But whatever it hit will feel it big time, but not much
else.  I believe the BIG bombs in vietnam that smashed huge areas were in
the 750 pound range.  or about .3 kilotons.

Oops.  Bad karma, dude.  Much as I hate to piss on your campfire,
I\'ve got to side with Steve Higginbotham (quoted below).  What does

I should be so lucky.  This may, in fact, be true in a city like
Pittsburgh, with a nice, big population base to choose from.  In
a city the size of Corvallis (population 48,000 and shrinking),
the only possible source of game fodder is the university, and the
kind of mewing, masturbating, adolescent slime you get there can
put you right off role-playing altogether.  If you can afford to
pick and choose, you don\'t know how lucky you\'ve got it.

Grrrr.  That sound you hear is my hackles raising.  (More later, as
Steve H. is also guilty of this.)

What *IS* it with you people and D&D?!?  I can\'t think of any other
example of in all my personal experience to compare with the "holier-
than-thou", elitist *bullshit* I see on rec.games.frp, and the TML,
when it comes to the subject of D&D.  You just can\'t seem to slam
it enough.

Complain about the *RULES*?  For Christ\'s sake!!  It\'s the oldest
FRP still in wide-spread use!  So it\'s been through 2 revisions.
You can only change it so much before it stops being D&D and starts
being some other FRP.  You can find tons of flaws in *ANY* game system,
(including, as we all know, our beloved Traveller), just like you can
find devotees of any game system.

Complain about the players?  Again, oldest system in existance.  Of
*COURSE* there are lots of bad D&D players.  There are also lots of
*GOOD* ones!  When you\'ve been around that long, you\'re going to pick
up plenty of both.  It\'s just that the *BAD* D&D players get more
press (mostly from some RPG snobs I won\'t mention by name).  To
quote Sturgeon\'s Law, "Ninty percent of *EVERYTHING* is crap."

But I digress...

Mike, I agree with about 95% of your original post, but I\'m having
a really hard time seeing how it relates to Cynthia\'s "Rule #1".

Remember, RPG Rule #1 is "Don\'t give the Ref. ideas."  (Oops!  That\'s
Rule #4.) :^)

Actually (to paraphrase from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"),
Rule #1 is "There *IS* no Rule #1".

If you want ot opt for technical consistancy, fine.  If not, and
your players don\'t squawk, that\'s fine too.

Anyway, as Steve says...

I don\'t know that it\'s necessarily Rule #1, but it should *definitely*
be *SOMEWHERE* on the list.

 Er you know you want to talk starports know (gee I cant think why any
 one will be able to flame that heh !) . 
 
 Another question from me
 
 In todays terms how powerful are traveller computers in todays terms ?
 
 Please no scientific mumbo jumbo a scince student could only understand
 
 My idea was this . 
 
 A tech 11 hand computer (about 1/5 the size of a milk container) has
 a 20 meg hard disk and 2 meg memory . 
 
 What do you think
 
 "Oh and only real men talk traveller starports (and computers)"
 
 PS My views on cyberdecking computers, its workable, people just
 go skitz doing it . Besides the average starship computer seems to
 be fairly smart, and would HE want you sniffing through his
 underware draw doing it hmmmmmmmmm ......?

I *think* I heard all three of  you say roughly the same thing.  To wit:
It is the GM\'s job.  Don\'t abrogate it to a determined player.  (more or
less.)

Internal consistency is one of the tools at our disposal.  Secret weapons
are another.  "Just say \'no\'" is a third.  Choosing to use one in prefer-
ence to another does not make you a bad person (tm).  It only means you
have individual tastes.

To paraphrase Steve, the mind is our, and our players\' most potent tool. 
Occassionally one will misuse it.  Our job is to be prepared.  *Sometimes*
we can make our point by duking it out with the characters.  Often we
have to flex our muscle on the player.

collapse underground bunkers and the like.

I\'d like to thank Steve Higginbotham for his well-reasoned response
to my flailings on the last TML digest (BTW, Richard, it is precisely
BECAUSE of my thesis defense that I\'m as crabby as I am, and after 
a fourteen hour day of writing physics it was a handy way to blow off
steam); our disagreement, however, appears to be a moot point, based
on my interpretation of what Cynthia says versus his.

Cynthia\'s initial statement: "The bad guys have it too."

Steve\'s reasoning for the existence of this rule: "It is
technologically and societally consistent to assume that all
individuals at a given level of technology and "connectedness" can
access technology of a certain type, and one cannot therefore count on
a technic advantage at any given moment. One should predicate one\'s
actions based on the assumption that one\'s \'toys\' are inferior, or at
best comparable, to those of one\'s adversaries."

Metlay\'s reasoning for the existence for this rule: "One of the most
commonly seen means of game abuse is for parties to arm themselves 
heavily with weapons and technology so as to batter their way through
challenges provided by the Ref without forethought or care, regarding
their toys as a crutch for bad roleplaying. We can defeat this by
hitting back with all of the technology at our disposal."

Both are correct and non-exclusive, and if any blame must be laid, it
must be upon me for strictly adhering to my interpretation rather than
giving fair voicing to Steve\'s (and presumably Cynthia\'s). However, 
that does not invalidate my point. Rules like Cynthia\'s can and do exist
for the muzzling of players that should simply be shot and left in a 
snowdrift, and I would bet money that even in Traveller they exist for
MY reasons in more campaigns than they do for Steve\'s.

I apologize for any offense I may have caused by failing to consider
both interpretations, positive and negative, of the rule. But I will
NOT back down from my interpretation, any more than I\'d ask you to back 
down from yours.

That having been said, let me do some more flaming for a moment:

I envy you greatly, Steve, if you can honestly say that you have
rarely if ever seen a bad Ref running Traveller. In my experience of
the fourteen years the game has been in general circulation, the
proportion of truly awful Traveller refs, players and games I have
seen has been uncomfortably high. Maybe I ought to move to where
y\'all are, since you seem to have had better luck than me....

(At this point, I had written a very long, gruesomely detailed flame
elaborating on the above points to excess. I then wised up and deleted
it. Y\'all have had enough from me, and my lunch hour (well, 15 minutes)
is over and it\'s time to get back to work....)

The simple one out of the way first:
	Today, we can fit a 1-3 kiloton nuke in a 155mm
(6 inch diameter) artillery shell with ease.  I\'ve
seen actual (though prototype) football-sized ones.
There\'s really no point with a conventional fission
bomb to make it any less powerful than that; you reach
a point of inverse return where you have to design
it larger to get less power out of it... 8-)  You can
extrapolate as you wish out to TL15; I suspect that
you could with gravitic imploders and less-stable
elements make very, very big hydrogen bombs in a 
hand grenade sized package.  Hell, if you can build
a moderately capable nuclear damper, just put a 
kilo of Californium in a small damper container and just
turn the damper off to detonate it 8-)

On to Starports...
	Adam Naylor seems to have slightly misunderstood
the position of a Starport.  According to previous
published material, a starport is extraterritorial
in terms of local laws (imperial laws apply though),
but not for "ownership".  There are references to
company-owned worlds where the corporation was investing
in upgrading "their" starport.  In addition, there\'s
no good reason for the Imperial government to have
to be responsible for running them all.  As long as
everyone follows the Imperial rules about how starports
are run, and that seems standard, then everyone can
go have their own if they want 8-)

ok, I\'ll buy that GIVEN that the \'jack\' is smart enough to understand
how that brain processes information, which is something that isn\'t
completely known yet.  

but but but - the \'jack\' can know about the brain - but how can the
brain "know" about the jack?!?  Again I will kvetch that the info set
(which is on the cellular level) will not recognise ADDITIONAL alien
pathways represented by the jack.  I\'ll buy substitution of existing
pathways, but I still can\'t buy adding new functionality/paths.  

I suppose that some future genetic engineer will figure out a way to
reprogram the cellular info set (after all, that\'s what they\'re doing
now with dna splicing) and then it\'s possible for the brain at the
site of the jack to recognise the jack...  But think of the further
implications: if you can do that in the brain, you can presumably do
it elsewhere in the body too! An extra arms or two, folks?!?  And who
needs analgathics when you can just go ahead and reset the biological
clock?!?

I\'ll buy that (especially since that\'s how modern prosthetics work).

Yes, fourier forward and inverse transforms are wonderful little
things, unless, of course, you\'re in the middle of suffering through a
course in special functions...  ;->

In my universe the "Starport" is part of the contractual obligation
that the imperium has for the planet when it joins the imperium, the
same as the defense of the planet with the fleet, etc.

This means that when a planet jonis the Imperium, Imperial advisors
are sent in to help the local populace build the port, provide standard
reguations (e.g. communication frequencies), and manpower including
security. The natives still have to build it, which is why there is
such a variation between starport types (A-F).

There is nothing stopping the local populace from constructing their
own starport, in fact the Planet builders book includes the secondary
starports when generating the planet. The characters don\'t routinely
see these other ports because:
1) They are typically of lower class than the main (Imperial) port
2) Locals run them, so people are not certain of the security, etc.
3) The main port is well versed in customs etc, which the lesser ports
may not be
(I\'m sure there are more reasons, but it is essentially cyclical, people
use the main port most of the time because people use the main port 
frequently)

This (I think) would make a interesting diversion, the PC\'s have to
use a local port rather than the main one for whatever reason, and
then they have to deal with unknown customs, people trying to
cheat them (i.e. substandard fuel, unnecessary repairs) if they don\'t 
check closely. Bribery, etc.

Cease thy foaming and smooth thy hackles, O Excitable One. I stated,
plainly, that the people I no longer gamed with were good D&D players
but not good Traveller players. I\'m sorry if that immediately registered
as a D&D slam, but I was trying to hark back to the idea of a different
mindset, not to belittle D&D, which I have played and run off and on
since 1975 and which was the basis for the variant game that supported 
my single best campaign ever (1984-1987 nonstop). The people in it were
great D&D players-- among the best-- but we\'d started playing D&D because
my repeated attempts at Traveller games continually went flat with them.

And as far as finding players goes, I still maintain that no players beats
bad players every time. I can afford to be patient.

Apologies for even SEEMING to slam D&D (in any of it\'s incarnations). 
While it is true that most of the terrible GMs I have known stuck with
D&D, it is also true that some of the very best GMs I know stuck
exclusively to D&D.

Why should I complain about the rules?  They MUST be doing something

This also is true.  I have never denied it, and never would.  But the
bad D&Ders get more press because there are more of them (more players
implies more bad players, all else equal).  And Sturgeon\'s Law just
about covers it, all right...
 
BTW, why are we arguing about D&D?

	Two new GDW MegaTraveller thingies.  One is that Challenge
60 is out (which means that I ought to be paid for Surprise Party rsn 8-),
with the usual dearth of good MT stuff.  What it does have is the combat
rules for McInnis\'es Wet Navy (which I wasn\'t totally impressed by),
A bunch of starship designs by Gannon that are theoretically "Black War"
warships (they look better done than the last naval suppliment.  There\'s
even a 12,000 ton J3, 3G Meson Gun J CL, which we all know is a very
useful type of ship to have 8-).  An interesting tidbit in the
Traveller News Service indicates that Dulinor is starting to play
hardball opressing his political opposition within his home area
(or alternatively that Terrorism is on the rise in a _big_ way,
another great sign of the onset of chaos).

	Other product, and this is a neat one, is a $4.50
miniadventure by Charles Gannon entitled "Assignment: Vigilante".
It\'s about a starmerc outfit with a modified Subsidized liner
turned fighter-carrier, operating as an anti-piracy force in Diaspora
sector.  It\'s got a 16-page campaign/scenario book, a color 3-page
cardboard ship deckplan for the title liner (with some other random
but good artwork), and seems like a truly great package for the
size and money.  I suggest it highly.  I also intend to convince GDW
that this is a great format to do adventures in (bigger than Challenge
can run, but a whole lot less hassle than a "real" adventure, which
is 4-6 times as big).

This is becoming something of a standard litany, isn\'t it Mike?

Sigh.  Every have one of those days?  You sit and read something
you posted earlier to some public forum or other.  With each line,
you turn a deeper shade of red, and all that runs through your mind,
over and over again, is, "My *GOD*!  Did I *REALLY* write that?
What was I thinking?"

Anyway, Mike and Steve, sorry for the inappropriate ass-chewing.
I was weaned on AD&D.  For over eight years, it was all I played
(\'cause nobody wanted to try anything else).  Now, it\'s to the
point where *any* reference triggers a Pavlovian response.

Oh, BTW...

> And as far as finding players goes, I still maintain that no players beats
> bad players every time. I can afford to be patient.

I don\'t know about that.  Desparation can breed a lot of (short term)
tolerance.

Actually, what I really came here to talk about is...

Richard asks:

> Okay, just what IS _your_ rule #1?  (and 2 and 3)

You want rules?  OK, here\'s rules.

  Rule #1.  The GM is always right.
  Rule #2.  If the GM is wrong, see Rule #1.
  Rule #3.  If the GM is still wrong, there\'s the door.
  Rule #4.  Don\'t give the GM ideas.
  Rule #5.  Don\'t give the *players* ideas.
  Rule #6.  Shut up.  You\'re *dead*.
  Rule #7.  Marguaritas and magic don\'t mix.

Now, for some explanations.  (Substitute the pronoun "she" for
"he" where appropriate.)

Rule #1.  It *is* the GM (DM, Ref., whatever) who\'s running the
game.  He creates the rules.  He is in charge.  That\'s the whole
concept of a "Game*MASTER*".  Anything else breeds anarchy.  If
games built on the premise that everyone on the room has the same
degree of power and control would work, why isn\'t the market
crawling with them?

Rule #2.  The GM is also human.  But proving he\'s a dope in
mid-adventure is a recipe for disaster.  If you *must* contest
his ruling, do it after the adventure.  You may convince him
that you\'re right and he\'s wrong, and even if you don\'t, at
least the difference of opinion won\'t disrupt the game for the
rest of the players.

Rule #3.  If you consistantly disagree with your GM\'s rules/
style/minatures color-scheme/etc., you can always leave the
game.  If you\'re the only one in the group who has this problem,
maybe that should tell you something.  If all the players feel
the way you do, maybe that should tell the GM something.  Be
that as it may, some people won\'t or can\'t change.  Find another
game.

Rule #4.  Definitely a rule for players.  If your GM is worth
his salt, he\'ll be devious enough without any prodding from you.

Rule #5.  For you GM\'s there, reverse Rule #4.  It goes double
for devious players.

Rule #6.  Maybe it\'s just common sense and common courtesy, but
my experience tells me neither are very common.  If your character
gets greased, kibitzing can be more that just inappropriate.  Of
course, depending on how your PC died, maybe your ideas aren\'t
all that great to begin with. :^)

Rule #7.  Ditto Gin and Jump Drives.  A brew maybe great for
that upcoming Blazers/Suns game, but it can be a really *BAD*
idea for role-playing.  Inebriation and imagination are, for
the most part, mutually exclusive.

That\'s enough.

(Tomorrow, I pack the SCUBA gear and take the Sillinger out over
the bar, no matter *HOW* deep the swells are!  All this sitting
around and waiting is making me itch.)

				 the blue?"

Rule #1: Don\'t give the Ref ideas.

Rule #2: Keep the Ref happy.
      2a-- Feed the Ref.
      2b (of limited applicability) -- Kiss the Ref.

Rule #3: That\'s a LOVELY loophole; it won\'t work.
      3a-- Because I SAID so, that\'s why.

Rule #4: Don\'t spoil the Ref\'s dramatic developments.

(Famous last words: "Oh, Metlay can\'t kill us yet. The villain has to appear
and reveal who he is, then explain his plans to us in detail and taunt us
for being helpless while leaving us a loophole to escape and foil him in

Rule #5: Shut up. You\'re dead.

THINGS TO AVOID IN A RPG:

1. Players whose introduction of their characters mentions any sort of
inanimate object in their possession, e.g. "I\'m running a Marine and he
has an FGMP-16 and some way-cool cybernetically enhanced bionic arms and..."

2. Refs who are careful about in what terms their rulings are couched
when dealing with certain players.

("That\'s an awkward sentence, Metlay."  "Not really. Last game I
played in in college, if the girl leading the party ever had anything
bad happen to her character, the Ref (her boyfriend) slept on the couch.")

3. Refs who lean on one aspect of a game to the exclusion of all else,
e.g. "What do you mean you have to leave early? The adventure\'s almost
over, we only have three more melees to run through!"

4. Anyone who reads from a script. EVER.

5. Refs who laugh at their players, or vice versa.

(this list is dedicated to Mikey and Ed, the worst refs I\'d ever met
in my life until I met Floyd in 1990.)

Traveller\'s Guide to Iakr Sector:  Fan Asteroid Belt
	The Fan Belt was settled 345 years ago by sufferers of Fan\'s
disease:  genetic disease causing malformed coils in the inner
ear.  Some malformations were likened to the shape of a fan thus
the name.  Sufferers of the disease become dizzy while in
accelerating frames of reference including vehicles and
gravitational wells.  Victims often do not live long due to
eating and balance problems.
	The Fan Belt offered a zero gravity community where people
who suffered from the condition could lead normal productive
lives.  It became a leper colony for the victims.  However,
several other conditions of sophonts respond positively to zero
gravity.  As more cases and species arrived the demand for
medical care expanded proportionately.
	The entire system has become a very cosmopolitan hospital.
Species of almost every kind are to be found there trying not to
step on each others cultural toes.  The medical research of the
entire sector is done there with equipment given from the
Imperium and Consulate.  As the two vie for prestige, everyone
profits.
	And, as the Fan Belt is only a few parsecs away from the
Zhodani Consulate, it is not surprising to find a Psi-Institute
there.

	Dr. Kissofman removed the blood stained rubber gloves, and
spoke into his computer.  "Autopsy John Doe, engineer of
privateer Flamboyant.  Cause of death:  poison, self inflicted.
Prussic acid contained in false tooth.
	"Physical characteristics:  one point seven one meters tall.
Hair:  blonde.  Eyes:  blue.  Skin Color:  White.  Mole on left
hand.  Racial Background:  Solomani with traces of Vilani and
Vlazhdumecta mixture typical of Iakr sector.
	"Small musculature indicates gravitational well of planet of
birth not above 1G most probably 0.7G.  Somewhat large degree of
recent retinal disintegration indicates subject spent time on planet
with thin atmosphere.  Thin atmospheres allowing more penetration of
Ultra Violet light.  Previous medical and dental operations
indicate the subject lived in conditions of between tech levels
nine and thirteen.
	"Signs of treatment of following conditions:  Removal of
wisdom teeth.  Correction of liver trouble..."
	- XIII -
	Dr. Oylessic looked on the oddest patient it had ever seen.
The human, Drert, was thirty years old, had psi-strength that
went off the normal scale while its official rating had been
five.  It had an officially recorded intelligence of five, now
unreadable, had been diagnosed as incurably psychotic, but its
chief interest at the moment was counting its toes, and
occasionally sucking on them.
	The little droyne flapped noisily to it\'s desk and puzzled.
"Dr. Jietlshaiepr," it squeaked, "Never I have such a case seen.
Had to guess I did, say I would that it some sort of psionic shock
was.  It a phenomena without precedence is.  Explain what
happened please."
	Jietlshaiepr told the story, the ancient artifact,
Malenkoviepr\'s recognition of the object, the effect it gave off,
and the changes in Drert, and the reports on everyone else.
	"I see."  The little droyne reached into a leather pouch and
produced a dark blue crystal similar in shape to the artifact.
"This an olonde is.  Used in the ceremony of casting is.  When
young droyne into a caste set is, the olonde is the focus for its
concentration.  By concentrating on it in certain way, young
droyne may open genetic codes which will in its proper caste set.
	"Also used for the training of young are they.  As you may
know, Droyne through telepathy sometimes impart knowledge and
training.  The olonde used in this is.
	"May be one used in ancient time energy stored as you of
spoke.  If so, energy released at proper time must be.  Triggered
it something did and let loose the accumulated energy in torrent,
those nearby strongly affecting."
	Jietlshaiepr rested her head in her hand.  "So, could the
presence of a young mind possibly be something like a trigger for
this... olonde?"
	"Possible it is.  Have seen I report on others of group so
affected.  Affects of change, correlate with age subject.  All
received increased psionic strength correlated with age of
subject and distance from crystal as described.  Your self,
closest, increased strength by four points and telepath become.
Pilot Niedrsha three points, now telepath is.  Engineer Shtam,
greater age, two points increased and awareness acquired.
Steward Miakr youngest:  five points increased.  Telepath has
become.
	"Significant this is, think I.  But olonde activate did not
until patient crystal touched."
	Jietlshaiepr\'s eyebrows knitted, "So Drert was the trigger.
Something in his psychotic mind released the energy."
	"Apparently it seems."  The little droyne stretched its
wings.  "Gunner Drert rather childlike at the moment seems.
	Drert rolled over, suspended in mid air, and went to sleep
with his toes in his mouth.
	- XIV -
	"I\'ve plotted our course to Massina," sighed Niedrsha.
"Three jumps:  three parsecs to Talak, four more to Aramat, then
two parsecs to Massina belt.  Since we\'re in a bit of a hurry we
can skim fuel from gas giants rather than wait to be refueled."
	"Why go to Aramat?" asked Miakr.  "The Ine Givar didn\'t have
any bases there:  no clues.  We could head to Axly just as well,
at least we\'d be safer from pirates in patrolled system."
	Niedrsha made a chopping motion with his hand.  "That\'s just
it.  It\'s over-patrolled.  They might pull us in to investigate.
And any bureaucratic mess is going to keep us from looking for
the doc."
	Shtam nodded, "True, the Axly race do tend to be rather
aggressive.  Independent military craft travelling through are
very thoroughly examined.  I remember once they held up an entire
convoy once because we were travelling with an armed escort."
	Miakr glanced at Vole.  "Well, I mean, if we\'re out to look
for Dr. Malenkoviepr, shouldn\'t we just skip Massina?"
	Gresha looked at the startled expressions of the rest of the
crew.  After all it seemed like a reasonable suggestion, in fact
a very good one.
	Jietlshaiepr shook her head slowly.  "We have our orders.
Our duty is to the Consulate."
	"Of course." agreed Niedrsha.
	"Indeed, and in addition, Massina, may also be as good place
as any to start our search." pointed out Shtam.  "After all,
that\'s where the Ine Givar, if that\'s who they were, contacted
him."
	Gresha sniffed, "Sorens is closer.  That\'s where they
contacted the Broadsword."
	Vole glanced around the room solemnly and focused on Miakr.
"Our duty is to the Consulate.  If we can get information on who
used this ship we will probably save more lives than one."
	- XV -
	One week later the Flamboyant was on it\'s way out of the
system.
	The emergency band burst across the bridge blaring with the
sound of an emergency locator transmitter.
	Jietlshaiepr grabbed the sensors.  "Ship just jumped in
system... 600 tons, heavy damage, radiation.  Viepchakl!  It\'s
one of ours!  Shivva class frigate.  Something really shot her to
pieces!  Heavy radiation.  Niedrsha, plot intercept course, there
may be survivors!"
	The Flamboyant veered around to match vectors with the
glowing hulk.  "ETA thirteen minutes.  We\'ll be the first ones
there." announced Niedrsha.
	A weak voice came over the band, "Mayday... Mayday...
Consular patrol frigate Uttova, Ensign Ebladatl speaking.  Come
in please.  Mayday...."
	"This is the captured corsair Flamboyant." answered
Jietlshaiepr, "Come in Uttova, do you have casualties?"
	"Affirmative, Flamboyant, request assistance.  Three crew
survivors...  Radiation burns...  They nuked us...."
	"This is the Fan Asteroid Belt Starport control," came an
authoritative voice, "Report your situation,  Uttova."
	"Jumped in from Acrolund... on interdiction patrol...
Deadhead\'s nuked us... Positive identification... Our relief
ship... Kinunir Cruiser... Heavy casualties... Fighters lost...
Bridge crew dead... Ensign Ebladatl now commanding...."
	- XVI -
	The Uttova was a shattered hulk.  Half of her turrets were
cracked open like nuts.  Most of the fuel tanks were shredded.
The maneuver drives were twisted like taffy.  The bridge had a hole
right through it.  While the landing bay was a fused glowing lump.
	The voice on the radio whispered weakly "Two survivors
unconscious...  Rest crew dead.  You\'ll have to pull us out... I
got crew in rescue balls... I\'m in a suit...  Air lock controls
out... Have to cut in... Cabin pressure up... can\'t control... Cut
in starboard lock... Starboard lock... Cut in..."
	"I read you Ensign." radioed Jietlshaiepr.  "We\'ll get you
out in five minutes.
	"Shtam, ready the gig.  Niedrsha, you stay with the ship.
Gresha, Miakr, Vole, were going over there.  Battle dress, every
one.  The radiation level is safe for about forty minutes
exposure.  Plenty of time."
	The lock was obscured by wreckage.  The twisted ribs of hull
bracing were bent back jaggedly over the entrance.  Hours of work
with a laser welder.
	"Uttova, do you read?" asked Jietlshaiepr.
	A whisper came back.  "...Yes..."
	"Move away from the lock, we are going to have to cut with a
plasma gun."
	"Affirm..."
	Gresha pointed the gun to the lock, angled away so as not to
fire into the ship when it would penetrate the door.  Plasma
leapt out.  The hull ribs glowed.  Again the plasma blasted,
licking away the outer most of the obstructing struts.  A third
blast ate away at the abstract sculpture of twisted struts and
plates, and a fog sprang from the seals of the airlock as the
ship\'s atmosphere began to leak away.
	"This may take some time..." thought Gresha aloud.
	Two minutes later they had a hole large enough to see
through.  Jietlshaiepr floated carefully among the molten
wreckage to the hole.
	The inside\'s of the ship was a mess.  Duct work and pipes
had collapsed, but she could see a place where she could stand.
"Roland\'s cruiser did a great job on this ship."
	Jietlshaiepr vanished and reappeared inside the hulk.
She caught herself from falling as she adjusted to the ship\'s
artificial gravity field.
	A vacc suited figure lay on the deck among five inflated
rescue balls.  "Ensign Ebladatl?"
	The figure lay unmoving.  Jietlshaiepr checked the face
plate.  Grease and blood was smeared on the young Ensign\'s face.
"Dead?"
	An eye lid fluttered, no more.
	Ebladatl was like a feather in her arms as Jietlshaiepr
teleported outside.
	"Vole, take him to the gig.  I\'ll have to teleport back in
for the others."
	- XVII -
	Shtam piloted the Gig back to the hospital complex.  "ETA,
one hour fifteen minutes."
	Jietlshaiepr moved quickly, the two crewmen were the worst
off.  She and Vole stripped them of their irradiated rescue
balls.  Radiation sickness well advanced.  High fever, hair gone,
skin deterioration, tumors... "Good thing we\'re in the Fan Belt."
	"Hmm.  Looks like Ebladatl has been regenerating himself,
he\'s psionic."  Jietlshaiepr carefully examined the medical
readouts.  "Traces of Psi-double, probably taken a week ago.
give him another and he may be able to regenerate in a few hours.
He must have been using the last of his energy to send the
distress call.
	"Shtam, have the hospital standing by with two doses of Psi-
double."
	- XVIII -
	Two hours later the Zhodani fleet crews were boiling over.
The Deadhead\'s had fired on the Uttova.  They\'d been asking for
war for years.  This time they\'d get what\'s coming to them.  Ten
Zhdits class destroyer escorts, eight Zhdine missile corvettes,
four Shivva class patrol frigates prepared to jump to Acrolund to
catch the Impie if it was still lurking there.
	High Consul Tlievriashav listened briefly to Jietlshaiepr
but was not convinced.  Their sighting was interesting but surely
there was some mistake.  The Imperials would not let one of their
newest battle cruisers fall into pirate hands.  And the
disposition of all such cruisers was known:  All in service save
one converted to a prison, two destroyed, one lost, presumed
destroyed years ago.
	Besides Tlievriashav had seen the Kliemoshie, the
instruments could not be considered that reliable anyhow.  The
Ine Givar ship could not have been a Kinunir class cruiser.  And
why would the Ine Givar attack their own allies anyway?
	Such a cruiser would be a valuable resource, what private
group would risk damaging it by tangling with a Consular patrol
frigate on an interdicted planet?  Acrolund had nothing of value,
it\'s own nuclear war had seen to that.
	No, the lying deadheads must have struck.  They came in with
the cruiser pretending to be the relief ship and attacked.  Why?
Who knows what devious plot the vicious liars had in mind.
Consular-Imperial relations were running fairly smoothly at the
moment.  But, with the Fourth Frontier War twenty years old, is
the Imperium now secretly preparing for war?
	- XIX -
	Ensign Ebladatl smiled at his nurse and scratched him behind
his armor plated ears.  "Good boy."
	Vole looked at Ebladatl for a moment before replying.
"Woof.  Woof.  Now hold still, I\'m not finished with your
physical."  Vole shook his head slowly to himself.
	"Well, Ensign you seem to be doing well." commented
Jietlshaiepr as she watched the proceedings.
	Ebladatl grinned broadly at the curvaceous surgeon.  "I sure
am, Doc!  I owe you my life.  I can\'t really thank you enough...
How are Selen and Chtanch?"
	"They\'ll recover.  Not as quickly as you, artificial
regeneration takes some time."
	"Thank you!"
	"Wait till you get my bill." she quipped.
	"Send it to the Navy."
	"Suppose you tell me about the attack."
	"Well sure!" smiled the Ensign eager to impress the
beautiful surgeon.  "We picked up a ship bearing in on us, but
with it\'s transponder cut off.  They wouldn\'t answer our radio
either.  The captain gave the order to scramble the fighters so I
ordered them off, I was the fighter coordinator.  The fighters
came in close enough for visual, and with telepathy, I could see
through their eyes it was a Kinunir class cruiser.
	"Now, let me explain about Acrolund, since the nuclear war
there, the Consulate and Imperium have been blockading the system
so that the planet will be forced to get back on it\'s own two
feet.  We protect them from pirate raiders that would want to
plunder the place, and generally keep it safe.
	"Our relief ship was to be Imperial one because we trade off
in shifts.  Any way, we assumed there were some communication
problems with them so we held our fire."
	Fury crept into the young man\'s voice, "Then, the stupid
liars knocked half of our fighters out of existence.
	"We fought, but their first hit knocked our nuclear damper
out.  They put a nuke into us that fused the maneuver drives and
half the power plant.  The laser and missile turrets burned away.
I think we hit them once or twice.  The captain ordered the
fighters back, we were going to jump out system.
	"But as they docked a nuke destroyed our landing dock and
holed the bridge.  I think I was knocked out for a moment, then I
realized rest of the bridge crew was dead."
	Ebladatl took a deep breath, "Suddenly, I was in command."
	He paused a moment and sat silently before continuing,
"The jump was laid in so I hit the button.  I barely made it into
a pressurized compartment just before the ship jumped.
	"I had to care for the survivors \'cause I was the only one
who could keep going.  I took psi-drugs to keep regenerating
myself, but there was only a few doses.  I was using my
regeneration almost constantly for a week.  Loosing ground
though.  I had to store some before I could have the strength to
make the transmissions.  But I made it.
	"I guess you know the rest of the story."
	"Are you certain that the crew aboard the cruiser was
Imperial?" asked Shtam.
	"Of course they were!  Who else would attack us?  And who
else would be in that kind of cruiser?"
	Shtam quickly explained the presence of the Ine Givar
cruiser.
	Ebladatl didn\'t even consider the thought. "Why should the
Ine Givar attack us?  They\'re psionic.  No, it had to be the
Deadheads.  They have no honesty in their culture, their whole
system is based on lies!  They\'re as bad as the Vargr!  You can\'t
trust any of them!  If I run into the Deadheads again, they won\'t
know what hit them." Ebladatl promised.
	- XX -
	Aramat Gas Giant
	Gas giants are often the main source of fuel in frontier
systems.  The fuel is free albeit unrefined, and when a ship need
only refuel one can easily jump into a descending orbit using the
forward momentum of the ship.  The ship opens its intakes, makes
a quick fuel pass, close up scoops and raise itself back to jump
point.  The process takes about 10 hours.  However, during this
time the ship is vulnerable to attack.  Inside the gravity well
of the giant there are few escape routes.  With pirates above,
and crushing pressure below, one gets to feel a bit like the
filling in a sandwich which is about to be eaten.
	"Keep a close watch on the sensors, Jiet." warned Niedrsha,
"We don\'t need any more surprises from unwanted friends."
	"Everything is clear."  muttered Jietlshaiepr, "Nothing on
the neutrino detector.  I\'d have found anything the size of a
scout ship or larger by now."
	"There still could be fighter craft.  A larger ship nearby,
but out of range.  I want a clear scan before we start a dive
into the grav well."
	"Ok," she sighed, "Nothing on the neutrino detectors.
Switching to passive EMS scan."
	Jietlshaiepr studied the screen.  "Nothing accelerating out
there.  There\'s some junk that\'s orbiting the planet but it\'s not
maneuvering... that\'s odd... There\'s an asteroid in a cometary
orbit.  It comes pretty close to the atmosphere.  It must have
been captured recently by the gas giant or it would have burned
up.  Probably will soon anyway."
	"So what." voiced Niedrsha.
	"Well, it\'s just that it... Hold it... Displacement of
asteroid three hundred tons... exact.  It\'s a ship.  Red alert!
Going active!"
	Niedrsha wrestled with the controls while eyeing the
tactical display.  The Flamboyant raised her nose.  The ship
began blazing out of the gas giant\'s gravity well at four G\'s.
"Here we go!"
	Jietlshaiepr read off the readings.  "I make the target out
to be a three hundred ton ship, refined metal hull, dispersed
structure.  Power unknown.  Acceleration unknown.  It\'s just
sitting there."
	"Then we\'ve got em." grined Niedrsha.  "Prepare to open
fire."
	"It\'s still just sitting there.  In fact... wait a minute...
It\'s tumbling!"
	"Tumbling?"
	Jietlshaiepr looked up.  "Power out put zero.  Maneuver
zero.  It\'s just drifting in space."
	"It\'s a trap." said Niedrsha decisively.  "We\'ll head out
and continue scanning."
	Shtam came over the intercom.  "If it is a trap, we should
probably power down the reactor.  We will be less conspicuous to
a neutrino detector."
	"Right, Shtam." replied Niedrsha, "Take the power down to
factor four.  With that I still have enough maneuvering power.
When I\'ve got us in a safe orbit, cut it down to minimum."
	The Flamboyant continued to rise, looking in every direction
for signs of pursuit.
	- XXI -
	The Flamboyant drifted, legs drawn up tight, but with its
eyes wide.
	The other ship continued to tumble.
	Nothing moved.
	"There\'s nothing out there I can find." yawned Jietlshaiepr.
"No power generated, none radiated, no radio, nothing.  That ship\'s
as dead as garrison duty on a saturday night."
	"We\'ve only been looking for a few hours.  I say we sit
tight and wait." warned Niedrsha.
	"How long?" asked Jietlshaiepr.
	"Till we\'re sure."
	"I\'m sure." she sighed.  "Look, in its orbit, the ship comes
pretty high out of the gravity well, probably jumped in system
with a high momentum.  We can match vectors with it while it is
far away from the gas giant, make a close inspection, and not
get caught too deeply by the gravity well."
	- XXII -
	The ship began to grow on the screen.
	"Here we come to the bait." thought Niedrsha aloud.
	The ship was a strange design.  A main cylinder with three
pylons protruding from the center.  Getting closer, the cylinder
resolved itself into a dumb bell shape, but with one end
flattened along one axis.  A heavy framework obscured the lines
of the ship.  Most of the ship was painted yellow and black.
This was marred by sections painted various colors almost none of
which matched:  the effect of this was that the ship resembled
one which had been torn apart and put back together with pieces
of other ships of the same model.
	"What a fuckin\' mess." snarled Niedrsha with disgust. "I\'ve
never seen anything like it."
	"It looks familiar to me." announced Shtam anxiously from
the engine room.  "I think it\'s a Vargr warship design, give me a
minute, and I\'ll get..."
	"It\'s a Vixen." announced Gresha from her turret controls.
	"Of course!" shouted Shtam.  "I should have recognized it.
I have never seen one before.  Wow!"
	"She\'s hot." called Jietlshaiepr.  "Reading radioactives
over there."
	"What?" asked Niedrsha anxiously.
	"It\'s armed with nuclear warheads." she warned.
	"Any power readings?"
	"None.  I would have told you."  Jietlshaiepr closed her
eyes to concentrate.  Slowly, and hesitantly she reached out for
frequencies not used in electromagnetics.  Psionic wavelengths
were as dead as the Vixen\'s fusion reactor.  "Well, after all
this time, I\'ve learned this much of telepathy:  There is no life
aboard that thing."
	"Vixens are robot missile strikers." explained Gresha.
"Usually armed with nukes."
	"They are also incapable of refueling themselves." called
Shtam.  "This one must have run out of fuel.  They are generally
used as first strike waves in wars.  A fleet of Vixens jump into
a system and attack shipping or conduct surface bombardment.
There\'s a robot crew so they are completely expendable.  A bit
expensive, but they are generally considered nothing more than a
missile bus.  A MIRV with a jump drive."
	"Merv?  who\'s Merv?" asked Miakr.
	Shtam spelled it out "Multiple independently-targetable
re-entry vehicles.  A type of missile that carries more than one
warhead."
	"Oh."
	"The Vixen carries a fifty ton missile bay, and three triple
missile turrets." continued Shtam.  "Of course no ship that small
has the structure to take the strain of that much firepower.
Generally, the ships shake themselves apart."
	"That\'s probably what happened to this one." commented
Jietlshaiepr.  "The hull sections show as having been under
extreme stress.  But the stress lines are odd.  The don\'t match...
It could be that the ship was cannibalized from several ships to
get a complete one."
	"Could the fuckin\' thing be a trap?" asked Niedrsha.  "It\'s
got atomic warheads."
	"But there\'s no power being generated." objected
Jietlshaiepr.
	"It could still be booby trapped." pointed out Gresha.
	Shtam\'s voice came over the intercom authoritatively,
"Right, I suggest we send over a boarding party consisting of
myself, Gresha, and Miakr.  We can investigate it without risking
the rest of the ship."
	"Why us?" asked Miakr.
	"I\'ll go to evaluate the engines, Gresha obviously knows a
Vixen on sight, we need you to evaluate the condition of the
robots aboard."
	"I\'ll come too.  He\'ll be needing me." announced Vole.
	- XXIII -
	Gresha pulled the gig close to the tumbling Vixen.
	"Any idea\'s on how to get in?" asked Miakr.
	"There\'ll be an emergency manual hatch switch beside the
main airlock." reported Gresha.  "\'Course that\'s the best place
to leave a trap.  Our best bet\'s the turrets.  The ship\'ll be
depressurized because there\'s no living crew.  We can just open
on up the inspection hatch, and get on in."
	"Easier said than done." observed Vole.  "The ship is
tumbling end over end at a rate of one revolution every seven
point three four seconds.  With a radius of fifteen meters that
will make centripetal force of..."
	"Eleven meters per second per second centripetal
acceleration." interrupted Miakr.  "Just over one standard G."
	Shtam picked up the tethers he had ready, "We will secure
lines to the hull framework and climb to the turret on the pylon.
Any of you ever done any repelling before?"

Intersting.  I just recently got a thing from the EAA (experimental 
aircraft association) discussing the FAA\'s (federal aviation 
administration - a government body) new policy on civilians with 
privately-held surplus USSR aircraft.

You\'re supposed to remove or "render inoperable" the guns.  Remove all
other weapons *and their mounts*, and remove or "render inoperable" the
ejection seat.  I guess they don\'t want abandonded aircraft coming down
on people\'s heads.  

Looks the policy is one of making sure the main differences between the
boy scouts and the army are "the scouts have adult leadership and the army
has heavy artillery"  :=)

However, most pilots I know _do_ carry sidearms, which is a contravention

A TL 8 hand computer can have 2 meg RAM.  Talk to someone with a Psion
Series 3 or a Hewlett-Packard 95.

A TL 9, or maybe even late TL 8 hand computer will have 20 meg of something.
It won\'t be a hard disc as we know it, because gyroscopic effects would
make using a hard disc in a hand computer a bad idea.  (An ACR with a 20 MB
hard disc supplying both gyro-stabilisation and data on the enemy\'s forces
might be an idea, though. :-)  But I would not be surprised to see some
sort of chip become available, such as the next generation of Flash EPROM,
which allows that sort of storage in a hand computer.

And a TL 11 hand computer?  That would probably have at least 100 MB in
some sort of memory, be it RAM, EPROM or whatever is being used at TL 11.

I can give you a stat on the other side.  In 1917, a Belgian relief ship 
collided with a French munitions carrier in Halifax Harbour; the Mont 
Blanc caught fire and 2 766 tons of picric acid, TNT and guncotton 
exploded.  Two and a half square kilometers of Halifax were flattened by 
the blast, the subsequent tidal wave, or the raging fire started when 
buildings collapsed in on burning stoves and furnaces. Windows were shattered 
in Truro, a hundred kilometers away.

The Halifax Explosion remains the world\'s greatest man-made non-nuclear 
explosion.

Bit of trivia and a bit of data. Help any?

Umm... I am afraid it gets more absurd than that, given modern technology.... 
Apparently, some researcher in California has come out with a 3D memory storage
unit that holds about 4 Tera (yes, Tera)(!!!!)  bytes of ROM. Any part of the 
storage can be accessed (by orders of magnitude) faster than modern computers
can handle. The size: about that of a sugar cube.
	(Quick Illustrative Analogy: equivalent to -- about 1K file on every 
person on the planet, enough for 500 library of congresses, etc. etc. etc.)
	The problem: right now, information stored on the device lasts about 8
hours at room temperature, and only a couple of months at liq. helium
temperatures. (Note: any inorganic chemist who wants to become REALLY rich
might think about working on a more durable analog than what is out there today.
	I forget the details (who, when,where,etc )-- but I remember seeing it i
in the New York Times. I will post with further info.

*Traveller*, here\'s my general FRP gaming rules...

1.  GMs and players incapable of maintaing civilized adult
    interpersonal interactions under *all* circumstances need
    not apply.  The fact that one is playing a game doesn\'t
    excuse one adopting a dismal standard of behavior (although
    the way certain people on this list have been going on
    lately, I\'m not sure I\'d want to interact with them outside
    the gaming environment either (1/2 :-)).

2.  GMs and players without a healthy or better sense of humor
    need not apply either.  This is important enough to rate
    rule #2 by itself.

3.  The GM and players are meeting to work together at having
    fun.  Anybody who\'s not trying hard to have fun and to help
    everybody else in the room have fun should go away.
    Corollary:  nobody "wins" at an FRP game.  Or everybody
    does.  The (real-life) competition is against boredom and
    ennui, not against each other.

4.  One only buys the rules to help keep the gaming company in
    business, and thus producing other useful gaming materials.
    One should, in fact, ignore or change the rules at any
    plausible opportunity.  Last I checked, we\'re doing fantasy,
    not rule-playing.  This rule will only work if the GM and
    most of the players are reasonable people.  See rules 1-3
    above.

5.  Roleplay, roleplay, roleplay.  If one has trouble
    roleplaying, one should pick a character so far from one\'s
    own self image that one *has* to roleplay to play at all.
    The GM must be a roleplayer par excellence.

6.  No fewer than 3 players (excluding GM), no more than 6.
    These numbers are completely empirical, and the *very best*
    groupings can probably get away with 7 players, while lame
    groupings should have no more than 4, if they choose to
    play at all.

7.  Always try to find a convenient resolution (in the music-
    theoretical sense) within 3-4 hours of the start of the
    gaming session.  People\'s brains can\'t take more continuous
    gaming than that.  (Of course, second and even third
    sessions are both permissible and encouraged, but the group
    should resolve things quite a bit and take at least a
    half-hour break first.)  Again, these numbers are empirical,
    but highly recommended.

Thanks much for an interesting exercise -- the process of
formalizing and ordering these rules really helped me see what
I\'ve been doing.  Major flames, anyone?

Late Tech 8 or tech 9??? What about today\'s technology? I just read this 
in the latest (May 1992 p61) issue of Network Computing:

GRiD has announced PalmPAD, the first wearable pen computer, a 2.8 pound
full-featured pen-based PC with a 6.5 inch backlit screen, 2Mb of RAM, and
a slot for a 20-Mb *solid state* "Disk Drive". molded rubber and plastic
package that can pass a three foot drop test on concrete. One cable provides
power and comm link allowing well-dressed power users to turn their belts
into expansion buses. Dubbed Belt Bus, the "LAN that is worn around your
belt" will accommodate "future belt-mounted peripherals, such as printers, 
magnetic stripe readers, and batteries". The main unit\'s grip is hollowed
out to fit either 2,400-bps data-fax modem or a spread-spectrum radio
modem (microwave technology). Base price: US$ 2,895

    The following message includes a note from GDW (guess they are tired
about being flamed personally). But first I want to get two cents in
on a couple of things.

    To make a long message short:

    FIRST OFF, the last couple of bundles have included some FLAMES,
personally I\'m not particularly interested in watching gamers flame
each other about good GM/Player vs. bad GM/Player, I\'ve heard it all
before, and especially since I have to pay for the Internet access,
I don\'t appreciate bandwidth taken up by wasted words (even if I didn\'t
pay, I don\'t appreciate the wasted storage). SO IF YOUR GOING TO FLAME
each other keep it PRIVATE.

    Secondly, I\'m tired of hearing about the same complaints about
Traveller or MT (new ones are okay). What I would be interested in seeing
is fixes, or helpful suggestions and I haven\'t seen as many of those
as I would like to see.

    And as for a third generation of Traveller, considering that the
game is nearly as old as D&D (or AD&D to you younger guys <grin>), a third
edition is perhaps not out of line, especially as the second was somewhat
incomplete (to phrase it one way at least).

OTHER MESSAGES,

Catie Helm,
    I believe it was you that mentioned a write-up on a race called
"Racoonoids", I might be interested in such an article (name would
definitely have to be changed though, too Space Operish to me).


    <CYBERTECHNOLOGY> Most game systems nowadays presume the the technology
use the brains normal existing nervous system pathways (as do some modern day
prosthetic devices).
    Now about 16 years I do recall reading articles that talked about direct
brain/computer hookups that did not use the existing pathways. They tended
to presume it would be easier to map the brain out and develop the equipment
to hook in. At that time they expected the technology to be available around
the mid 90\'s. About the only technology that I am aware of that currently
exists is the wristwatch pagers and credit card radios (providing the
communications pathway to the computer database) and some work done
use old apple computers to help paraplegics walk. But no direct brain
interface yet (although those developments are about 2-3 years old too).
    About the only possible problem with cybertechnology is that
Nanotechnology might quickly replace it in part.

You all have seen me get up on my soap box from time to time to
complain, but It isn\'t very often that I\'ve seen someone step up
on one to proclaim victory!  :-)

Challenge 61 is out.  Just read through it.

There is a pretty good adventure thing by Terry McInnes concerning
a nuclear powered wet navy on TL 6 Aramanx (Powderkeg of the
Towers Cluster)

(Well *I* liked it anyway.  Remember who it was who put out so many
Wet Navy designs before there were any rules to do so!  And most of
those ships were TL 6 too!  :-)

But what is the excitment about?  I hear you all wondering.  Well,
Fission power.  They have finally revised the fission power fuel
requirements.  I can\'t exactly figure out what they did, but I have
been able to get the following approximations from their ship
designs.

The nuclear fission reactor power plant now provides:
Power Output:	   0.2MW per Kiloliter of power plant.
Fuel consumption:  0.05Kl of fuel per 360 days.

(Fuel consumption is still way to high, but it is better than it was before)

Weight and cost of the plant I have not calculated.

Fuel consumption of Fission plants has been a pet peeve of mine
for a while.  Ever since I calculated that the USS Nautilus would
have consumed 90 percent of it\'s mass in uranium if it had been built
according to the original MegaTrav specs.  :-P

So, this is kinda neat. (But only to the design freaks out there)  But
it does bring some interesting things up.  Using the above power plant
(TL6) it is JUST barely possible to built a traveller starship that
can be fueled for an entire year.  Rather than 30 days as with normal
Fusion power.  (The main problem is weight)

So... Fusion is less efficient than Fission?  How interesting... :-(
(Sigh)

What is worse is that the above reactor is TL 6.  Now imagine what
increases in efficiency there would be in a higher tech fission plant?
Well with the more advanced shielding from superdense materials.  Not to
mention nuclear dampers to play with, what is a TL 15 fission plant gonna
look like?

Well, despite this, I consider it a victory.  SOMEBODY up there finally
noticed that the fission plants were WAY off.  I think Rob Dean once
mentioned to someone that fission plants as stated were rediculous.  Maybe
somehow it was that mention that worked it\'s way into the acticle.  Or
maybe someone up there read one of my endless tirades on how nuclear
powered designs were completely impossible with MegaTrav.  Or (gasp!)
someone was smart enough to figure it out by themselves!

Nevertheless, it is a small step forward to bringing Trav closer to
reality!  YAHOO!  :-)

What next I wonder?  Will GDW begin making MORE corrections where Trav is
WAY off in terms of reality?  Well... Lemme get my list...  Lessee...

Thrust to weight ratio?
Where every Type A Free trader has the thrust to weight ratio 3 times that
of an SR-71 and is barely able to reach Mach 1...

Aircraft engine rated thrusts?
Where every engine has five or six times the thrust it should have?

What else?

Hmmm...
I ususally call anyone who can\'t spell my name correctly (when He/she
is copying it from other written matter) an idiot, but let that pass.
 
Reasons for thinking the people who generated MT are idiots:
 
     1)  COACC.  I\'m one of the few people who post to the TML
regularly who LIKED COACC.  But I NEVER use it, because the various
engines presented on page 32 all have performances that are out to
lunch.  None of those engines (except the fusion rocket) have NOT been
built, so it should have been a simple matter to look up actual
thrust/fuel usage/mass figures, and use them.  The people responsible
didn\'t bother, so you have rockets with higher Isp than jets.  Your
(yes, I know that you personnally had nothing to do with COACC (or at
least your name isn\'t mentioned on the credits)) fusion rocket has an
Isp of 2,000,000,000 and change.  Which translates to an exhaust
velocity of 19,656,000 Km/s, which you should notice is 65.565 times
the speed of light.
     2)  Neutrino detectors.  You all inserted a neutrino detector
into your starship design sequence that fits in a suitcase.  This
device was supposed to be able to detect the neutrino emmissions from
a 10Kw power plant at long range (if it couldn\'t detect a 10Kw power
plant, then the 10Kw rating was pretty silly).  Considering what we
know about neutrinos, its fairly safe to say that catching enough of
them to make detection meaningful would require a substance, which, if
plated over a ship as armour, would make the ship immune to trivial
things like meson guns, particle beams, and nuclear weapons.  We
bogused up an explanation that didn\'t require perfect armour to be
invented along with the neutrino detector, but I doubt our explanation
could work unless the detector were the size of a Mac truck, as
opposed to a small suitcase.
     3)  Spacecraft with a density 4+ times that of platinum.  Try
it.  Design a spacecraft with armour 115 (bonded superdense, of
course).  Put all the usual contents (J-drive, M-drive, P-plant, etc)
inside.  Then divide computed mass by computed volume.  Density 85+.
     4)  10,000 year old technology that has never been improved
enough to bring the price down from point of introduction (LPHG grav
modules)
     5)  A trade system which makes merchandise more expensive if
BUILT (not bought) away from a large rail-center.  I can believe that
the products of Nakege are more expensive to buy at Efate, but I find
it hard to believe that when I go to Nakege, they are marking things
up above the price I would have to pay elsewhere.  Great way to make
sure I don\'t go there, terrible way to assume economics work.
     6)  For that matter, a trade system in an adventure kind of game
that encourages the players to stay near the center of civilization. 
Arguably the best thing to do with your shiny new ship is to run back
and forth between Efate and Louzy until it gets paid off.  You get
gobs of money that you would never see wandering around among "E" and
"D" starports in the boonies.
     7)  The generation of star types for the worlds of the Spinward
Marches that places Ag worlds around M7 V (0534, 1526, 2231), M6 V
(0614, 1817, 2908), M9 V (0710, 0732, 2523, 3004), M5 V (1210, 3138),
M8 VI (1912), M9 D (2324), F3 D (2912), none of which are in the
habitable zone, because there IS NO HABITABLE ZONE for those stars. 
And if you can get "Ag" without being in the habitable zone, then why
is "Ag" even meaningful, when ANYONE can grow crops under ideal
conditions in a dome?
     8)  Trade class "In", which assumes that you cannot have lots of
industry without a polluted atmosphere, even though the major source
of air pollution (burning oil/coal/etc) stopped with the advent of
fusion power some thousands of years ago.
     9)  Fission power plants for vehicles/starships with fuel usage
rather more than 1000 times as high as REAL fission plants have.  By
your rules, the submarine I was on should have had to carry 58,500
tons of fuel to operate as it did.  Since the boat only massed
7000-odd tons, I\'m pretty sure it DIDN\'T carry that much fuel.  This
is information available in any good university library.  Along with
that, fissionable fuel that has a density higher than iridium.
     10)  Laser/maser communicators that use more power than radios.
     11)  Hard Times.  Which either should be MUCH worse than it is,
or not nearly so bad as it is.  You managed to find the ONE point to
stabilize at that is unstable - it should either fix itself quickly
(ten years or so), or collapse back to the stone age (in a century or
less).  And the adventure/campaign in Hard Times provides the "good
guys" with a ship that can beat the whole "bad guy" fleet without
assistance.  So why bother with the rest of the adventure/campaign?
     12)  Data dsiplay headsets.  Introduced at TL13 in MT. 
Introduced four or five years ago in the real world.
 
     I\'m frankly getting tired of typing, so I\'ll stop here.  Is this
enough reason for me to suspect the MT designers are idiots?  If not,
I\'ll gladly send more.
 
     But, be that as it may, I was speaking largely facetiously when I
called you all "idiots".  I think you all made a great TRY at
integrating the disparate elements in your rules.  I just wish it had
been a great success.  You introduced a task system (which is great!),
and a vehicle system (which falls apart near the limits), then didn\'t
bother to integrate starship design/combat into the vehicle system. 
You added in aircraft, without ever bothering to insert into the rules
a good reason for them existing after the introduction of grav.  You
publish modules where ships specifically described as having no fuel
scoops are seen to be scooping fuel at a gas giant (Knightfall). 
"Fighting Ships of the Shattered Imperium" (Shattered Ships of the
Fighting Imperium?) includes a large number of ships that violate your
own rules (check the armour values assigned to BB-11, BB-12, BL-13,
BM-15, BH-14, BH-15), and almost no ships that are especially
combat-effective.  That\'s just careless, sloppy work with a bad
spreadsheet, which is supposed to be caught by editors.
 
     BTW, I do NOT disapprove of your third edition of Traveller.  And I
don\'t approve of it because of your second edition, but in spite of it. 
But let\'s see some good work, with an editor who EDITs, rather than
spell-checks with his word-processor.  And a little reality checking
wouldn\'t hurt, either.
 
     Last comments:  If you need someone to give something a fine-tooth
"internal logic check", I\'m always here.  And you would probably get
more MT stuff for Challenge if you (a) payed a little better, or (b)
tried less hard to appear as if you were dumping MT in your eternal
quest to separate us from more of our money.  At the very least, I\'d
send you stuff better than most of the stuff you do publish for MT.  And
WHY did you dump 2300AD and 1889???  What was done was among your best
work since the original Traveller, but now it\'s gone, never to return...
 
                              ----Steve Higginbotham

often than I call GDW people idiots, in fact...

This is one that\'s been sitting on my back burner for a bit.
Sorry this took me so long to get back to, I\'ve been busy and there was a
lot here to read over and consider.

}From: bryan borich <70541.1410@CompuServe.COM>
}Subject: (4095) Alternate Starship Combat System
}Variant starship combat rules. Fighters have more chance to knock out a
}battleship, but only if they are in large formations. Ships or fighters
}with armor-120 can now be damaged by weapons smaller than factor-T.

Hmm, according to the design tables in the Referee\'s Guide, this should NOT
be a problem until Tech Level 24.  (Max armor is TL *5)  So the max armor
available in the Imperium (That *I* wanna deal with) is Armor=75G at TL 15).
But then again, Shattered Ships of the Squabbling Imperium is chock full of
the things and other assorted errors.

}2. Damage Point Computation
}  The component hit points computed during design evaluation are not used
}in the current combat rules. This variant uses them.
}  First, we will compute the damage points each type of weapons does.
}  Turret mounted weapons do 10*UCP in damage. A bay weapon does 20*UCP in
}damage. Spinal mounts do 100*UCP in damage.
}  Nuclear and anti-matter do four times the precalculated damage. Example:
}a UCP-3 turret firing nuclear missiles does 120 points of damage ((3*10)*4).

I like it.  A way we can actually USE those damage point numbers we\'ve been
patiently calculating and recording and never using.  Sounds like a good
idea.

}  Hull. To find out when the armor factor is reduced, divide the
}inoperative value by the armor factor. The Planet has an inoperative hull
}value of 67500 and an armor factor of 50. Each 1350 hits received reduce the
}armor factor by one.

I kind of like the idea that a weapon still causes damage even though it
may not penetrate the hull.  I heartily appaud this idea.  Assigning chassis
damage is a good idea.  Also burning it\'s armor off sounds plausible.

}Computer. I had trouble making damage plausible without being too
}devastating. Weapons with a UCP of 1-4 give "Computer-1", UCP of 5-9 gives
}"Computer-2", and UCP-A gives "Computer-3." On exceptional success reduce the
}computer factor by an additional one.

Hmm, my reading of the damage tables must be slightly different from yours.
I understood that Computer-1 would knock one computer off line, Computer-2
takes 2, and so on.  In High Guard we knocked the computer level down.  So
what gives?

}7. Optional Sensor Rules
}  Make all sensor tasks one level less difficult if the target is in an
}adjacent hex.
}Make active sensor tasks one level more difficult:
}o if the target is within a gas giant, 
}o when attempted through a hex where a nuclear missile has exploded.
}o if target uses jamming.
}Neutrino detection:
}o If target\'s EMLevel is faint, give a -1 DM to neutrino scans.
}o If target\'s EMLevel is strong, give a +1 DM to neutrino scans.

Don\'t forget background neutrinos.  (The sun... high population planets
where everybody owns a fusion powered air/raft... etc.)

}Densitometer detection:
}o If target is small, give a -1 DM to densitometer scans.
}o If target is large, give a +1 DM to densitometer scans.
}o Increase detection task difficulty by one level if detection is
}attempted through a planet or moon with size 5+ or through a planetoid belt.

All the above sound like good ideas.  However the range and detection of
sensors needs work.  As far as I can see, it is just about impossible to
detect a ship at the rated range of the sensors.  Now I can understand that
a sensor could detect other ships out to far orbit range, but even with a
model 9 computer and a Far orbit range sensor, you just can\'t detect them
that far.  So what does a \'Far Orbit\' sensor detect?  What does an
\'Interstellar\' sensor detect?  If the answer is nothing, why then are they
called that?

You see, my good old astigmatic Mark I eyeball is a passive sensor that can
detect objects at GALACTIC ranges.  *Without* my glasses.  But it hardly
can distinguish a ship at ranges of more than a few tens of kilometers.

Therefore, the range bands of sensors need clarification.

}Time and distance. I plan to scale down the time and distance scale in
}starship combat from 20 minutes/25000km to 4 minutes/5000km. For longer combat
}turns, more damage must be given for each hit.

Bad Idea.  In my experience, opposing ships open fire as soon as they are
within range.  (Far orbit)  With 4 minute turns and 5000 km hexes how big
a board are you gonna have to plot the movement on?  Far orbit range would
leave you with 100 hexes to worry about.  It gets rediculous!  If each hex
is a centimeter, your map needs to be a meter across.  In my experince,
combat lasts several turns say 10?  In forty minutes, ships will not close
significantly from Far Orbit ranges.  By the time they got within close range
(to use fusion guns and where meson gun performance goes up) They will be
lifeless drifting rocks burned to bits by laser batteries and missiles.

}  Movement: I am inclined to make some changes in the movement rules.
}  First, I want to make heading changes somewhat more difficult. As in
}Interceptor or Leviathan, it costs thrust points to change heading. What I
}want to do is require a certain number of hexes travelled at a given velocity
}before allowing a one hex side course change. How many hexes to travel may
}depend on both maneuver gee and/or agility. Using this rule would make it
}appropriate to limit the arc of the spinal mount to forward.

Hold it right there!  Are you telling me that a ship with (at the very least)
1 G thrust to mass ratio CAN\'T bring it\'s nose to bear on target EVEN in
the FOUR MINUTE time intervals you suggest?  No WAY!  If a ship can not turn
faster than that, then agility would have no hope of bringing any correction
help in avoiding fire.

And given the fact that they are (and should remain) 20 minute turn intervals,
I have some trouble seeing any firing arc restrictions.  Even the ones we
currently use!

What you are suggesting sounds vaguely reminiscent of the fact that aircraft
cannot instantly bring their nose to bear on target as they approach higher
and higher speeds.  In a vaccum this will not be a problem:  No wings.

Changing VECTORS is a totally different story.  You can\'t suddenly switch
your heading by 180 degrees without applying your maneuver drive.  ie you
can\'t be moving 12 hexes per turn in one direction and in the next turn
be heading in the opposite direction at the same speed.  (unless you have
a Maneuver drive with 24G\'s behind it!)

(I haven\'t read MEgaTrav combat very well, PLEASE don\'t tell me you can do
that with their rules...  I still go by the Mayday movement rules)

I don\'t know about Leviathan or Interceptor or the type of game they are
trying to create.  But this sounds like you are trying to get the feel of
a more World War I & II type of air combat:  Dogfighting.  Well, with the
ranges and weapons involved, I\'m afraid it will be more akin to 2 F-14
Tomcats detecting each other *Well* beyond visual range and fireing Pheonix
missiles at each other at something like a hundred nautical miles.

}DAMAGE RESULTS
}Fuel Tank. I\'m going to change the "fuel tank shattered" to "fuel leak".

In a 20 minute turn, a fuel tank that is open to space will evacuate itself.
Even a slow leak.  I have trouble seeing it not empty itself even in the
four minute intervals you suggest.  If there is a leak, that fuel in that
compartment will be lost immediately.  It won\'t bleed off slowly unless it is
a tiny leak.  A self sealing tank should be well able to handle any such tiny
leaks.

No.  If the structure is sound enough to take 1G acceleration, it can
certainly stand rotational stresses which would be negligible in a four

That doesn\'t make sence.  If there is an open path for ships to leave, then
there exists a path for them to enter.  I think you are confusing slow

deck operations are of necessity held at high speeds to prevent aircraft

On a completely different subject,
Mr. Borich, I\'m not going to respond to your attack concerning flames.
I\'m sure some of our more irrascable members will do that.  I will however
SUGGEST that in future the way to extinguish flames is with water, not flame.

And if you are interested in solutions to particular problems with Trav and
MegaTrav, I would point you to the archives to find the numerous discussions
on problems percieved and solutions proposed.  If you have any particular
problems in mind, I suggest you address them yourself so that discussion may
ensue.  I think you will find this preferable rather than waiting for others
to bring them up if you find the wait so disturbing.

Sincerely,
Scott S. Kellogg

	Not that it has any significant bearing on Traveller,
but I thought I ought to properly explain the why behind the FAA\'s
"take it all off" ruling about ex-soviet warplanes in civilian hands.

	The Federal Bureau of Alcohol and Firearms (BATF) regulates
among other things weapons sales and import/export in the US,
from handguns to nuclear missiles (though nobody\'s ever asked for that
particular permit... it does exist on paper, tho 8-).
	A normal civilian simply cannot within the US own what\'s
term a Weapon of Mass Destruction.  You have to be registered as
an Arms Dealer to have one, not an impossible (or even all that
expensive; I spend more many years on Gaming stuff than the permit
would cost for that level...) task, but one that few people do.
	If you\'re not a dealer, then you can\'t have a Weapon of 
Mass Destruction.  Aircraft and Tanks (and ships and missiles and...)
all fall under the Weapons of Mass Destruction category.  Any aircraft
that was origionally a combat aircraft is a weapon.
	To "de-weaponify" one, you have to honest to god make it impossible
to put weapons back in without making serious modifications... i.e. take
the weapons and mounts both out, remove weapons pylons from the
outside, etc.  The FAA isn\'t the one making this rule; it\'s the BATF.
I don\'t know about the Ejection Seat, but civilians in the US have
owned them before (a civil-owned F-104 set a new speed-at-height record
at one point, then went out of control.  The pilot ejected and
survived).  I would guess that either these are the ejection seats
that use a cannon shell as the ejection charge (ouch), or that
the FAA will grant specific exemptions later (perhaps) to people who
prove they\'ll treat and maintain the (dangerous) ejection seats right.

	Here\'s an optional MegaTraveller craft design sequence
modification/optional rule that I\'d like some comments on...

CRAMPED ENGINE ROOMS
	The average drive on a MegaTraveller craft only takes up half
of the physical volume it\'s placed within.  The listed space requirements
include sufficient space for easy access to all parts, and for easy
disassembly and maintenance.
	It is possible to design a craft without this margin of extra
space, but this will result in more difficult maintenance.
	If a drive is only given 90% of its listed space, it will require
10% more maintenance time (or 110% the engineering crew) a normal drive
requires.  In addition, all maintenance tasks done on a time-constrained
basis (such as damage control and emergency repairs) have a DM of -1.
Remember, that with only 90% of the space, there\'s a 20% reduction in
the actual work space to do maintenance in.
	If a drive has only 80% of its listed space, it requires 20%
more maintenance time and all hasty tasks recieve a DM of -2.
	If a drive has only 70% of its listed space, it requires 40% more
maintenance time (or 140% of the engineering crew) and all maintenance
and repair tasks are one difficulty level harder, no matter how much time
is available.
	If a drive has only 60% of its listed space, it requires 100%
more maintenance time (or 200% the normal crew) and tasks more significant
than minor repairs cannot be done without opening up the hull to get more
access space to components.  All tasks that can be performed are two
difficulty levels harder.
	If an additional cost of 10% of the base
drive cost is paid, access panels can be included in the hull
to allow access at "normal" repair rates to the drive on a vessel with
60% (or more) volume allocated.
Otherwise, the craft will have to be stopped at a starport and
have the hull welded open to get to components, at a cost that is
equal to the percentage of the hull (metal) cost that the drive
in question occupies.

This got me thinking.  Has anybody calculated what sort of impetus a
close-range nuke would apply to a well-armored ship?  All that armor
isn\'t going to do an awful lot of good if the ship ends up thrown with
20 G\'s of acceleration for a not-so-small duration of time.  Kinda like
subs being tossed around by depth charges - eventually you\'ll compromise
structural integrity of the ship (and the crew\'s bodies).

What was that conversion factor between joules and Megatons of TNT...

This is a good idea, but...
 
You\'re reducing the amount of working space to 20% of the normal.
Then you\'re saying you can partially counterbalance the difficulty
of getting in that smaller space to repair things by squeezing
MORE people into there?
 
I think the bit about adding additional crew needs to be reworked
to reflect diminishing returns - at some point, adding an extra crew
member is going to cost you because of cramped space.  I think that
point comes well before you reach squeezing your normal crew into
10% of the space they\'re used to (twice the normal crew in 20% of
normal workspace).
 
Say, if you reduce the engine workspace, you still need the same
size crew, but fewer of them can work at once, thus increasing repair
time and difficulty.  Or some variation thereof.

Only one thing I take exception to here:  Less space shouldn\'t require
more engineering crew, since they would only get in each other\'s way
in the cramped space.  I saw enough of that on the submarine to last a
lifetime.  Try requiring more maintenance groundside (for every day in
space, the engineering crew has to work xx% of a day after landing to
get ready for the next flight).

I agree.  I\'m skeptical about burning off armour unless the weapons
are really horrendous (large nukes, spinal mounts, MANY batteries of
lesser stuff).

There is NO "neutrino scan" in this game.  Neutrino detectors are
integrated into PEMS scan tasks.  Neutrino detectors do do pinpoint 
tasks, but EMLevel has little, if anything, to do with neutrino 
emissions, and so should have little to do with associated tasks.  
In any case, the subject is already dealt with in the rules:  faint
EMlevel means you need an exceptional success, strong EMlevel needs 
anything better than exceptional failure.

The first two cases are already dealt with in the rules: small targets
require exceptional success to detect with PasObjScan/Pin, large
objects are detected with anything better than exceptional failure.
The third case assumes you can detect an object through a planet
8000Km thick with a sensor that has a max penetration of 1Km. 
Planetoid belts are mostly (99.9999999999999%) empty space - who cares
whether you hide in one?

Not bright idea, grasshopper.  Original assumption behind scale was
that hex size be distance traveled after time scale acceleration at
one G.  This has changed in MT, until distance scale has little, if
anything, to do with something so trivial as acceleration and
velocity. (proper scale should be 20min/15,000Km (or even 7500Km for
you high realism types (like me)).  Changing to a four minute time
scale requires that the distance scale be reduced to 600Km (or 1000Km
to stay consistant with MT).

Too true.  So don\'t use meson guns and fusion guns.  MT allows a
missile launcher to chunk out 1 shot per minute (in personal combat),
but only 1 shot per twenty minutes in ship combat.  Bringing those two
numbers in closer agreement won\'t bother me very much, even if it DOES
invalidate half the ship designs out there.

NO!!!  If you want to fix movement rules, get back to Mayday rules! 
They are the only set of movement rules that were ever orth the

I assume that fuel tanks are self-sealing (we do it now, why can\'t
they?), and that the fuel tanks are NOT "ONE BIG VOID" in the hull. 
Rather more like a myriad of little, self-contained tanks, linked by
piping with cutout valves that are closed in the event of leakage. 
Net result: fuel leaks are ridiculous, fuel tanks being shattered
slightly less so.  But only slightly.

Why not?  If the spinal mount is intact, it can shoot.  If the hull
can pull one G, then the recoil (if any) of the spinal mount is
irrelevant (unless the ship can pull more than one G backwards using
the spinal mount as a drive)

I don\'t disapprove of a revision of MegaTraveller either. In fact, if
you can repair some of MegaTraveller\'s defects so much the better. But
I strongly disapprove of your plans to invalidate most of the background
information that has been slowly building up over the last 15 years. As
I understand it, you even consider that wealth of information detrimental
in some way. Not I. One of the great problems with a startravelling role-
playing campaign is the sheer amount of information that the PCs should
have at their fingertips, but that the Referee simply haven\'t the time
to provide. Pick up a tourist guide to some country and look through it.
This is the kind of information that a PC should be able to get out of
any decent library data program, not just for every planet around him,
but for each seperate region of every planet around him. That\'s totally
impossible to provide, of course, but at least the information level for
a few of the regions of the Imperium were beginning to approach something
near the absolute bare minimum. And now you want to move the game back-
ground forward through 80 years of social upheaval, thereby ensuring that
only the geographical details will remain valid  -  and not those either
come to think about it... planetary bombardments must surely rearrange
the face of the planets too...

If you persist in your plans I advise you to publish the new rules and
the new background seperately. You will thereby ensure at least one
sale of the rulebook. I\'d be eager to buy improved rules, but I\'m not
going to invest in a new background.

	It seems like I only get to read the TML every 2 months. I uploaded
the issues and, lo and behold, the first was from March! Anyway...

	It looks like I am pretty much the only person who has spoken that
can say they almost unreservedly agree with Metlay (4109). It did, however,
touch on one particular well rehersed argument of mine...

	Proposal:		GAME BALANCE IS A MYTH

	Substantiantion:	Any system of rules has a balance point

	Discursion:
		I see the term "game balance" being bandied about a
lot. Usually w.r.t. "I don\'t allow xxx to maintain the game balance."
People change the rules to change the course of the game and make it
adhere to the setting in a way the referee desires more. To me, this is
backwards.
	If you look at a game setting as a point in space. The rules
govern how this point moves (i.e. by player action within the rules)
and the course it traces out can be described as the campaign. I maintain
that given any set of rules there are regions within that space that are
stable. I.e. under the normal course of application of game rules the
campaign will not greatly deviate from that region. These are balance
points.
	The perceived "imbalance" that is observed when people bring up the
myth of game balance is when the referee, out of ignorance or misunderstanding
of the game rules, sets their campaign at a point in the space that is
not within a balance point. When set there the normal course of gaming
action (within the rules) will draw that point, away from the original
setting, toward a region of balance. Thus, over time (sometimes a very
short amount of time) the campaign will move away from the original
region chosen by the referee.
	A referee sees this as undesirable, and unwilling to admit
to ignorance or just unable to perceive it, changes the rules in the
name of game balance. Usually the change in the rule system is not too
drastic which means the new regions of balance are "near" the old ones.
One might suppose that they are nearer the current point of game play.
However, given the campaign is currently accelerating in one direction
it is unlikely to be suddenly in a stable region, despite the fact that
this is the desire of the referee. It will, most likely, start careening
in a different direction under the new rules.
	Thus, as time goes on, the referee continues to change rules and
the campaign zooms from here to there chasing a moving target that it is
unlikely ever to reach.
	The mistake is in the placement of the game. One should consider
rules carefully and try to understand their full implications. Consulting
people who have played for some time is probably a good idea. I wouldn\'t
think one can ever fully understand a gaming system and one\'s target will
almost always be wrong. However you are better off watching the flow of
your campaign to see where it is going. As it deviates from its starting
position its further course will become clearer as more of the rule
implications filter through.
	If you change the rules you will never understand where the
campaign is going. I maintain that you should, instead, accept that there
will be some dynamicism in your campaign. Watch where it goes and be
prepared to flow with it. If you don\'t change the rules it won\'t change
direction and you have a better chance of understanding it fully.

	If you are familiar with mathematical modeling the above will
probably make ready sense to you (the more so if you grok topolocical
spaces :-). On the other hand it may make no sense whatsoever. Think
about it for a minute then either apply it or toss it...


	Different subject: Although quiet I\'ve not been sitting on my hands.
SYSGEN level 5 is nearly ready to hit the streets. It uses the same integrated
environment as LIBRARY which means, unfortunately, it only works on PCs.
In addition to nearly full WBH detail on each of 100 trillion planets
it now supports editing of all details at the expense of about 24K of disk
space per system. Right down to the local customs!
	What I want to finish is the adding and subtracting of entire
planets (i.e. you can only modify existing ones now) and graphical printing
of surfaces (I plan to support FX, HPLJET and PostScript printers). As I
don\'t have a PostScript printer I would appreciate any volunteer to test
that particular bit...
	The hard disk with the manual on it crashed so that will be delayed
(again!) bt there is now an on-line help feature. The .EXE has hit 250K! :-)
	Does GDW really read the TML now? The gods really are watching!
If the gods really are listening perhaps they might be willing to humour
a supplicant and have a look at LIBRARY or SYSGEN. It was designed to be
everything they promised us with the WBH software. I\'m quite sure they
get tons of half-arsed programmers sending them disks upon disks of planetary
generators but I think these are a fair cut above the rest and would beg
their indulgence just this once :-).

I\'ll answer this with the proviso that I may be corrected by any REAL aero-
dynamicists(SP?) out there....

Airplanes run into this problem because they must change COURSE to target an
enemy ship.  Since they only have a limited ability to change heading w/o
changing course, in atmosphere they are essentially the same thing.  Take any
airplane, mount small maneuvering jets in strategic places (nose, tail, wing
tips...) and put it in space and you separate the two.  You can now do things
that any self-respecting plane in atmosphere can\'t (move in direction A while
pointing in direction B)

You change heading with the manuevering jets, and course with the main engine
(if heading <> course).  The problem in atmosphere is that high-G turns put
the plane at the outer rim of a circle.  Since the linear speed is constant,
a smaller circle places a higher G-force on the plane/pilot.  Too much stress
on either the plane\'s structure or the pilot\'s and things start to fall apart.

Take a spaceship, change it\'s COURSE as fast as you change the plane\'s and
you will place an equivalent stress on it\'s structure.  The limiting factor
becomes how much stress the ship\'s/occupant\'s structure can take.  That\'s what
inertial dampers were invented for.

Question:  putting inertial dampers on an airplane should allow you to make
higher-G turns.  The limiting factor here becomes max linear speed (remember
frictional heating) + max rotational speed (which depends on elevator
deflection and moment arms and other things I don\'t want to think about).
True or not?

How big is the leak?  How much fuel is left in the tank?  These things will
all affect how fast the fuel will be lost.  Unless the leak approaches a
significant fraction of the tank size or there isn\'t much fuel left in the
tank, it won\'t be lost immediately.

No news is good news?  GDW opened the discussion of the revision again
on GEnie about a month ago, and there has been little activity.  I guess
that everything that people wanted to say was pretty much said last year
when the issue was first raised.  About the only things that are "certain"
are that it will be called "Traveller: The New Era" (TNE), and that the
basic mechanics will be Twilight:2000 with a d20 instead of a d10.  (So
much for that intersystem compatibility they were hoping for?).  The Star
Viking project (originally a miniatures game for planetary raids based on
Command Decision) will not be issued for Gencon as projected, and it won\'t
be a miniatures game when it does come out.  (Board game?)

Meanwhile, the folio adventure Assignment: Vigilante has been released with
absolutely no fanfare, for the bargain price of $4.50.

I can\'t say much else, since there isn\'t much to say.  I\'ve chided, castigated,
and cajoled GDW about this in private, in public and in person.  I\'ve 
volunteered to edit, to proofread, to playtest and gotten no real response.
I\'ve volunteered the list.  What else can I do?

Just as well--they are the ones responsible for most of the more peculiar
additions and insertions in MT.  However, since they dropped the Traveller
business to pursue their own game, they have been little seen...when was
AI supposed to be out?  Several months ago?  Rumor I heard had it that
40% of the final draft disappeared in a hard disk crash and is being
reconstructed...(The other 60% went too, but was recoverable).

As far as I am concerned, this intention of this rule has always been an
open question.  For starships, should that be 40 + 5*TL?  If not, then a
\'legal\' TL7 spacecraft is impossible.  (Tell the Apollo crew to give it up
boys--we can\'t build the command module thick enough!)

I don\'t.  At least not yet.  Look at it like this.  For smaller weapons
operating over a _short_ turn, a laser does MW damage if pulse, or 2*MW
damage if beam.  A ship sized beam laser should do 500 points of damage in
combat--more if the turn length is considered.  If it doesn\'t, then I\'ll
design my ships with the smaller weapons, nyet?  The principle is good, but
the math is bad.  This reminds me--have we _ever_ come to any agreement on
whether lasers actually shoot at their targets at far orbit range or whether
they just slash around hoping for a random hit?  If the latter, then a low
damage might be justifiable (but it should increase as range decreases, not
from differing beam strength but from increasing time on the target).  If  
the former, then the damage should be larger (or the damage from vehicle
mounted weapons should be smaller.)

Agree with Scott here.  A lot of stuff has been chewed over (and over and over)

True, and to tell you the truth, I don\'t see the real reason for this rule,
I would think you could always slap on thicker armor.  But the rule is on the
books, and it does solve the problem.  However, I would point out that the
Apollo capsule was not as radiation proof or as well armored as I am lead to
believe in the case of traveller starships.

Your right.  I hadn\'t considered that.  But I still like the idea of using
the damage point values.  What we need is to adopt a more mass oriented
system than the volume oriented system.  (ie 1 damage point per 15 tons
rather than per 15 kiloliters or something like that)

}This reminds me--have we _ever_ come to any agreement on

A good question.  *I* would assume the slashing movements for the lasers.
It seems to make sence within the confines of the game and as to what is
actually going on.  This would account for the increased probability of
hitting with lasers at closer ranges.

It sounds as though there are 2 more products to be released before Trav NE.
comes out.

An Astrogators guide to Diaspora, and a Survival guide.
the Survival guide is supposed to be a transition guide from MegaTrav to
Trav NE.  Both of these are supposed to be small booklets like Assignment
Vigilante.  ($5?)

The Astrogators guide is (supposed to be) due in September?

The Survival Guide is supposed to be due in October?
	(Don\'t quote me I wasn\'t taking notes)

Traveller The New Era Is supposed to be out in November.

Now, since Loren Wiseman seems to be listening in on us, I would like to
suggest to him that if he is interested in our input to stuff on this he
may find the Archives of the TML helpful.  Otherwise, If you want
me to, I can try and reiterate some of the suggestions that I have made
before.

Then again, I believe a lot of the stuff I\'ve said got sent over to GEnie
last fall.  So you may have already heard the stuff I got to say.

So, Whaddya say GDW?

That way, the entire effort could be on background/etc., rather than on more

Anyone ever consider what kind of effort it would take to make traveller 3D?
I know that 2D is so damn much simpler, but space isn\'t supposed to be simple.
What\'s the excitement of it\'s just a bunch of small islands on a real big 
sea? 
On the same topic, one thing that always bothered me was that population was
random, no matter how bad the conditions on the planet. 99 billion on a 
size A with atmosphere F is kind of hard to believe (much less that many on
size 1, no water, no air)! Why not have modifiers to the population roll based
on the other rolls? Say, something like this:

UCP	Size	Atmos	Water
- ----
0	-2	-3	-2
1	-1	-2	-1
2	-1	-2	-1
3	 0	-1	 0
4	 0	-1	 0
5	 0	 0	 0
6	 0	+1	 0
7	 0	-1	 0
8	 0	 0	 0
9	 0	-1	-1
A	+1	-2	-2
B+		-3

This way, you wouldn\'t have all those poor planets with billions next to 
the perfect one that the GM can name every person on.
Also, TL 9-B should reduce the effects of tainted atmosphere to tolerable
(say, carginogenic, or perhaps a simple lung-wash is needed every month),
C-D should make it nothing but a faint odor, and E+ should eliminate tainting
altogether. Remove the requirement for atmospheric type (make it 0-9) for
industrial worlds.

Anyone want to reinterpret the TLs to make it more sane? I don\'t mean changing
any number, but making Earth 1992, say, 4, and making higher numbers just
more specific high-technology. Ship design is going to be re-done anyway,
and all the high-tech weapons are silly to begin with.

One last thing. Why wouldn\'t the laser be the premiere weapon in `Hard Times\',
that pinnacle of hard science? You don\'t need to re-learn how to make
smokeless powder, no bullets to make or store or run out of, and no recoil.
Maybe an Ancient could explain that 200+ shots really aren\'t necessay, and
build a weapon with a Pen of ~15, 40 shots, and a 1-2 kg internal battery.
I know Traveller has this enormous fear of power (look at fission plants, etc.)
but this just seems (to me) just too logical. Get a rechargeable clip, and
when you run out of ammo, just plug \'er in the fusion plant. No other
energy-transfer technology needed (and lasers are what? TL 8? 7?!?).

This is perhaps a good idea in principle, George, but I think your math is
off.  Drives certianly do not take up their entire listed volume, but 50% is
a bit much to shave off.  I think working space is going to be a more
complicated function than just some percentage number.

Consider:  A huge battleship with a HUGE powerplant.  Does that mean that
50% of that huge volume is work space?

In it\'s simplest execution, imagine:  A spherical fusion plant with a series
of 3 meter cat walks running around it.  (In my opinion, that is about as
large an area as you could concievably use for repair work) Now for small
engines that would be more than 50% but with HUGE engines that would be much
less.  (I don\'t have my calculator here, but you can see how the numbers
would add up anyway)

Yup, supposedly, a Damper can either stabalize or destableize radioactive

started subscribing to this list.  Here, on these pages (pages??)
I learned about the Hard Times Suppliment and the upcomming TNE.
        One of the subjects that has been continually mentioned in

as an explanation for the fall of the Imperium.  They, apparently,
decided not to do this to the vast relief of nearly everyone on this

        I\'m just bloody curious.  What were they proposing for this
virus?  How was it supposed to work?  Why was the list so convinced
that the concept wouldn\'t work.
        If this subject has been bashed to death in the past and
no one in their right mind (which leaves me out, of course) cares to

Just a quick question:
I\'ve been throwing The 4.5th Frontier War out at you, but with a few
exceptions everybody\'s been pretty quiet about it (Hey Edmund! Er.. Michael)

So, does anyone have any comments?  Are you reading it?  Are you bored with
it?  Do you like it?  Any criticism?

Also, I know Grant & Co. is probably being delayed due to thisis madness.
But if memory serves, wasn\'t there someone else out there (a long time ago)
who was posting stories?  (Other than the PBEM)

I believe it was Catie Helm who redirected a message from someone not
directly connected ta the list.  That person offered to send in some stories.
(Sorry, can\'t remember names)  Well, if you got stories, sure!  Send em.  I
have been trying to keep the volume down by posting the whole shebang slowly.
I suggest you do the same.  If I tried to put the whole 4.5th Frontier War,
in, it would flood the list.  As is, I try to send them off over the weekend
or when the TML is running low on traffic.

Also, a note to those who have read the 4.5th Frontier War before.  Guys,
the stuff I\'ve been posting has been re-edited and redone since I sent you
the lot.  Not any real major changes, but you might want to throw out what I
originally sent you as it gets replaced.

Hydrogen Fuel Leaks:
Now consider:  When we talk about fuel leaks in Trav, we are not talking
about leaking gasoline in air.  We are talking about leaking Liquid
*HYDROGEN* into *VACCUM*.

What is gonna happen?  Well as soon as the pressure in the tank is reduced,
the hydrogen is gonna vaporize.  VOOM!  At that point you\'re gonna loose any
hope of keeping your leak contained.  It\'s worse than opening your airlock
to space.  Everything is going to escape.  No hope of containing it.  I
rather doubt that self sealing stuff would work.  Certainly not at TL 8 or 9.

The way self sealing tanks work today is when a bullet punches a whole in the
tank, there\'s a rubber liner which moves molds itself into the hole and plugs
the leak.  At liquid hydrogen temps, you\'re gonna have trouble finding
*ANYTHING* that is sufficiently plyable to function in this manner.  And
considering the weapons doing the hole punching, that hole is probably gonna
be a bit on the LARGE size.

As Steve pointed out, the fuel tanks are compartmentalized.  Thus when a
fuel hit occurs, we only loose 1% of total fuel.  (or 10 tons which ever
is greater)  This makes sence to me:  Slow leaks do not.

When a leak occurs, it is going to loose fuel all of a sudden, but then it
will stop when that fuel compartment is empty.  But *even* if you use 4
minute combat terms, it\'s gonna be all gone by the end of that turn.

About Armor Maximums:
Yes Steve, they do say max add-on armor is TL*5, but they never define add
on armor.  They have never explained weither we are to add that number to
40 or to 4.  The table seems to indicate that it is added on to 4, but I
could be mistaken.  If it is added on to 4 then the Apollo capsule could
*Almost* make it.  (Armor=39)

If we are to say that max armor is TL*5+40 then a TL 3 ironclad could have
Armor 55?  That doesn\'t sound right to me.

Despite a generally positive response, there are two questions that
keep coming up about the Cramped Engine Spaces.  One is that the
extra crew would have less space to work.  Two is that some people
don\'t think that 50% work space is an accurate figure.

	Responding to the first problem, I would argue that in most
vessels, a crew will be working from 10 to 12 hours on the drives,
at most, except during emergencies.  The rest of the time, they\'re
being left alone.  This is standard practice today with ships at sea;
you do routine maintenance during one "shift" with some overflow,
but leave it alone the rest of the time.
	Since there would be less space to work, with the same number
of people doing say "replacing lateral heat exchanger" the job will take
say one and a half times as long.  Which means that the two assistant
engineers will have two hours less to be calibrating the fuel feed
heater injectors, so you need someone else to handle that.
Not everyone is crawling over the physical drive at the same time.
You\'re just going to be increasing the length of time that the jobs
involving doing so take, thus requiring more people to handle the
other jobs.

	As for the second... 8-)  Look at any of the published deck
plans.  Azhanti High Lightnings have more than 50% empty or access
space in their drive rooms.   So do most (but not all) of the smaller
ships that have appeared in deck plan form.
	Real naval vessels today have between 50% and 80% of their 
drive spaces empty for maintenance and access purposes.  I think that
using the 50% figure is safe.

     Even hydrogen has a heat of vaporization.  If kept cold enough,
it won\'t instantly vaporize, even into vacuum.  And hydrogen CAN be
kept liquid at very close to vacuum pressure.  So it may not VOOM!
into vacuum.
     Note also that liquid ammonia stores more Hydrogen per kiloliter
than liquid hydrogen does (120Kg per Kl, as opposed to 70.6 Kg per
Kl).  So warships may (should!) be carrying fuel in the form of
ammonia, and processing it into H2 as needed.  Then the problem tends
to evaporate.

I doubt it, too.  I also suspect that space battles at TL8 and 9 are
pretty silly affairs, at best.

I always assumed 40.  Be that as it may, the Apollo capsule is a silly
example.  The apollo capsule (about two MT tons) did NOT mass 25+ tons
metric.  It also did not have a hull stronger than that on most MBTs. 
Estimated armour value of an Apollo is only 10 (at MOST).
 
 
>If we are to say that max armor is TL*5+40 then a TL 3 ironclad could

Nor to me.  Though that is only 5 feet of soft steel.  But then I
don\'t believe that maximum armour that can be fabricated is an
exponential function of TL, either.  And +5 per TL is exponential
(effective armour thickness increases by 57.3% per TL.
 
This is but a part of why I said the vehicle design system falls apart
at the limits - TL low vehicles are miracles of capability compared to
the real world, and TL high ones are, well, magic.  Consider that the
maximum armour value at TL15 is 115 (maybe), which translates to about
224 meters of hard steel.  Sure it\'s using bonded superdense, and is
thinner - (from Striker) it\'s actually only 16 meters thick.  A
hundred ton ship would have 100,000+ tons of armour, which SHOULD have
a volume of 6690 Kl, or 495 displacement tons.  Pretty amazing stuff,
eh?

Yes, but in George\'s defense I\'ll point out that the actual "workspace" of
the engineers is not included in the volume of the drive; it is included 
in the volume of the staterooms and other accommodations.  At least that
is how the game is currently rationalized.

OK.  I\'ll keep this very short. (-:  You\'re right.  A damper can clean
radiaoactive messes.  This function is specifically described in the
advanced rules for Striker (Book 2 out of 3), which is unfortunately a
little hard to come by right now.

This, by the way, is another example of a MT problem--the old-timers know
what a damper is and roughly how it works, but it isn\'t described anywhere
in MegaTraveller...lots of Striker stuff in MT without the required
explanations...

I agree with Steve.  Burning off armor is probably not necessary in a game
sense, as long as _some_ hull damage is occuring from what are currently
the "no damage" hits.  Let\'s look at the current vehicle combat rules,
scaled up to starships, for a second.  A 200 ton free/far trader has hull
points of 180/450 under the current rules.  A 250MW beam laser would do
500 points of damage on a "full penetration hit", and 50 points on a
"no penetration hit".  Now recalling that vehicles get their damage 
multiplied by ten, that would be 1800 points to disable the hull.  That\'s
only 36 laser shots--three fire phases from a ship with 4 triple turrets
with beam lasers (which would make a decent system defense boat in this
system...)  As it stands now, the poor SDB probably has all of his turrets
arranged as one factor 5 battery, which will cause weapon-1, maneuver-1 or
fuel-1 three times...  (Critical hits on a 5 battery vs. a 200 ton ship
disregarded.)

I wrote this into a \'minimalist\' vehicle system redesign when we had the 
first TDR flurry.  What was that?  About a year and a half ago?  As far as
I know, Bertil is the only one who took the idea and actually tried it out
in a game, and I seem to recall that he was pleased with it. (-:  If GDW
wants to revised this section of the rules, I\'d be all for it, and I think
that it would be an excellent time to stop and think about what damage 
values for weapons ought to be in relation to the number of damage points
for vehicles.  As it stands now, a typical tank (4 displacement tons)
has a hull value of, um, 4/9, which should be read as 40/90 in "personal"
combat.  A typical TL7 tank gun (say a 10cm high velocity, roughly equal
to a US 105mm) does about 10 points of damage per hit.  Thus, 13 hits
would be required to \'destroy\' the hull.  A single hit from a 50MW beam
laser will do 100.  Any idea what the muzzle energy of a 105 tank gun is?

The worst offenders in this problem are the aircraft.  I\'ve posted previously
my calculations showing that a typical current fighter plane in COACC can
take a couple of dozen hits from anti-aircraft missiles before becoming
unflyable...

We assume so in our games.  Standard Imperial policy after using
nuclear weapons is to clean it up with a damper so the marines can go
in.

I suspect romance could happen, physical liaison probably not.  Wrong
sexual cues form the aliens - they are probably no more sexually
exciting than a tree.  Though I do have a human character who thinks
female Aslan are "intriguing".

I wonder how they EVER figured it out, myself.  They have 421 (or
somewhat fewer) DIFFERENT cultures and technologies.  They don\'t even
use the same kind of screws from site to site.  So how did ANYONE ever
leap to the conclusion that they all belonged to one race?

I assume that the lasers are aimed exactly at close range, and may
hunt a small amount at long range.  Big question is how stable the
firing platform is, and MT seems to assume that the firing platform
has point-defense FC.  If so, it\'s about as stable as it gets, and
lasers should only have to hunt to deal with the uncertainty of the
target\'s position at long range.

BTW, why not use the rated damage from the table in the PLayer Book?  It
covers all shipboard weapons nicely, without having to make up another set
of numbers.

Quite true.  Liquid Ammonia has a greater atomic density of hydrogen than
pure liquid hydrogen.  Maybe the Traveller TNE folks should take note?

Yeah...  I\'m not sure what to use really.  It seems to me that you should
be able to just slap thicker armor on there if the design will still float.
I dunno what to say.  Max armor *I* know of at TL 6 was around 18 inches of
steel in the torpedo belts of battleships.  I think that qualifies as

Here\'s a question for you...If you carry your fuel as ammonia, what do you do
with the nitrogen after processing?  Vent it to space?  Store it for those
times when you use wilderness refuelling and recombine it with the H2 so you
can store it as ammonia again?

If you vent it, would it be possible to detect a ship by the cloud of nitrogen
it leaves behind it?  Or would it be a trail of N?  Would it leave enough N
to detect, perhaps by the wavelengths of light it absorbs from the local sun?
How much N would be contained in a tankful of ammonia?

But strangely enough there are Traveller planets that are radioactive.
Of course a half-way radioactive planet IS a dramatic locale for an
adventure. That\'s what I meant in a previous posting about situational
physics. When it\'s convenient you can and when it\'s convenient you can\'t.

One thing occurs to me, however. Nuclear dampers work by focussing a
\'node\' of a field on the material to be treated. That\'s why no nuclear
screens. Have anyone ever computed the amount of topsoil usually made
radioactive by a nuclear bombardment? How big is a damper node? (The
range of the field is a multiple of the distance between the two field
generators, but I don\'t think the size of the node is defined anywhere).
So how long would it take to focus a node on every cubic meter of the
affected area? How long do you have to keep it focussed? Perhaps cleaning
up a radioactive planet is not quite so easy as running a vaccuum cleaner
over a carpet.

421 huh? You know, that is just one of the glaring holes in the whole
Grandfather story. "He kept careful count of his descendants and made
sure he killed them all". Yeah, sure. But what about the children that
they had unknown to him? Say during the second millenium of the war when
those surviving must\'ve begun to suspect what he was up to, and in any
case needed allies. Not to mention all the programmed clones they must\'ve
made to decoy Grandfather into killing a clone instead of the real thing.

    'body' => 'George Herbert wrote a pretty good summary of the current state of US
law concerning Weapons of Mass Destruction, but I\'d like to clarify a
few of his points.

To buy and sell anti-tank guns, rocket launchers, etc., a person needs
a Federal Firearms License.  A Class III FFL allows one to deal in
full auto firearms and a few other controlled devices.  A Class II FFL,
I believe, is what George is referring to when he spoke of being registered
as an "Arms Dealer".  However, a FFL is not required to own controlled weapons,
only to sell them.  There is some licensing and paperwork involved to
buy a controlled device, but you don\'t have to be a registered dealer.  A
friend of mine buys C4 plastic explosives and shaped charges for his
business, a oil well perforation service.  He has to fill out a ton of
papers, but he doesn\'t need an FFL to buy.

Tanks and aircraft designed to carry weapons are not classed as weapons
in themselves.  Anyone can buy an M3 Stuart tank or a P-51 Mustang, sans
weapons, no problem.  What you have to do to disable the weapon carrying
capability depends on the BATF\'s whim.  I knew a group of WWII reenactors
in Oklahoma City who bought a Wehrmacht surplus Hetzer tank destroyer
from a museum in Switzerland in 1981.  To legally import into the
country, they had to have the breech block of the cannon cut in half
to disable it.  They had this pretty carefully done in Europe, then shipped
it to all to Oklahoma, where they applied for a manufacture permit to
enable the cannon.  Once they had the permit from the BATF, they had
the breech welded back together and they had a fully functional light
tank destroyer to play with.  Finding cannon shells to fire was a 
problem, though.

What\'s happening today is that the BATF is making up its own rules as it
goes along.  If the BATF doesn\'t want to allow something, they simply
restrict it, regardless of whether or not they have a legal basis to do
so.  For instance, there is an Executive order banning the import of
a list of specific weapons into the US.  The BATF has taken it upon itself
to expand that list to include weapons are not restricted by the order.
One dealer I\'ve read of got clearance from the BATF to import a number
of rifles, got them as far as a US Customs warehouse, then found that
the BATF had changed its mind.  The rifles are sitting in the warehouse,
they are legal to import, but the BATF says no, we won\'t let you bring
them in.  Sue us.

It\'s the same thing with the Soviet aircraft.  There are no real legal
restrictions on the aircraft or their systems, but the BATF is simply
overreaching its authority in what it can control.

To Byran Borich: hello.  With regards to "racoonids" I am not the
author of them - one of the people in my weekly traveller game
invented them several years ago, and we\'ve been playing with them ever
since.  We have a write-up which we were thinking of sending to
Challenge, but since we had character generation rules based on MT, we
decided to drag our feet and see what sorts of new character
generation rules we would get with TNE. (Now that Imperiallines is
coming out, we may send it there instead - we haven\'t decided.) I will
upload the basic write-up to this list over the week-end, but folks,
we really would like to get some comments back please.  We\'ve tried
very hard in our traveller game not to make them funny little people
in fuzzy suits, but rather real aliens.

About the "space opera" character of the name "Racoonid": that the
name was like-unto-space-opera had never crossed our minds.  It
sounded like as good a name as any, and it _is_ desciptive.
Alternatively, have you ever stopped to think just how space-operish
"Aslani" is?!?  ;->

Without a good representation the players only get confused and
discouraged by trying to visualize the 3-D map. If you had a computer
or a 3-D model of the universe then this could be quite practical.
Otherwise most players can\'t tell what planets are close to their current
postion, and almost none could plot a shortest route course though the 3-D
universe.

Just think of analogies on earth, why is japan so overcrowded while 
Austrailia which is relatively close is almost empty? Usually there
are socio-economic resaons why you see strange population figures, and
what we need is a program/method to come up with novel reasons why
there is a disparagy.

I agree totally with this, as someone else pointed out (Scott? Metlay? Steve?)
the fossel fuel burning is well past at high tech levels. Perhaps the
populace want to have a tainted atmosphere to be classified as industrial :-)

	Actually Lesley\'s ability to write fiction increases as parts of the
thesis become iminent :-). Displacement activity I suppose :-).
	I had posted "Getting Out of the Doledrums" some time ago. It is the
most relevant (and suitably short) of what I have. I have a fair amount of
stuff written but most of it deals with the pre-history of my campaign which
means it is about as relevant to standard traveller as the Similrilion is to
the Hobbit. There is other stuff which isn\'t as specific which uses a
Traveller like universe as a setting (there is one grim one I like about a
ship trapped while refueling in a gas giant by a fault in their static 
discharge probe).
	Alternatively there is this competition we wrote back in \'89. It was
100 pages long and we playtested it 11 times. We still can\'t get it out of
our heads! It occurs to me that a story, following the most amusing turns
of the playtesting and competition would make a humorious serial.

	So people, do you want fiction on the TML?

	Send me e-mail indicating "Yea" or "Nay" and, perhaps, the maximum
number of lines per bi-weekly mailing you would be willing to tolerate :-).
If I get sufficiently more Yeas than Nays I\'ll give it a test run. I\'ll talk
to James about shifting them down to the bottom of the mailing.

Yea. the TML moderator suggests one or two 20kB installments each week
- -- I have traditionally treated multi-part fiction like a story column
in a magazine. Messages over 6kB in size are automatically sorted by the
digester to the end of the digest (unless it appears to be a ship design
- - ship designs are treated as the very lowest form of life and are
always sorted as close to the absolute end of the digest as possible).

Well, in the USNavy it would mean that about 50% was work space.

Your experience obviously doesn\'t include removal of a motor-generator 5m
long from it\'s position in an engine room, and transport from there to a 
repair shop.  It takes more than 3m of space to do a lot of work.

George, in the boats we did maintenance 24 hours a day.  One watch on,
one watch maintenance, one watch asleep.  From the time the boat left
port till after it returned.

Are we eroding away the cabin space again?  If you assume work space is
part of the accomodations, you have work space amounting to less than 2%
of the machinery space.  You won\'t get much work done like that.

In the range of 5,000,000 to 8,000,000 joules, I believe.  Depends on
what kind of penetrator you use.

Scott, we can already make "slush hydrogen".  We expect to be able to make
it with 50% solid hydrogen in a few more years.  It\'s not THAT big a deal
to get the temperature down that far.

True.  Unless H2 is a really good heat conductor, it won\'t make much
difference to most of the contents of the tank, unless it\'s a small tnak.

Well, the obvious thing is to vent it with the waste hydrogen (you\'re only
fusing about four atoms per 7000 present).
Or there\'s my new alternative (to keep Cynthia on her toes, and annoy 
purists):  Since most of the hydrogen used is actually used as a coolant,
let\'s use the nitrogen waste as coolant, too.  You have to redesign the
heat exchangers, but that\'s not a big deal even now.  Assuming nitrogen 
makes about half as good a coolant as Hydrogen (and there really isn\'t a
good reason why it should be worse at all), then you can run your ship on
twice the MASS of fuel, which takes up about 23% of the VOLUME.  Then 
design a ship that can do 6G, agility-6, and 4 jump-6 without refueling.
(I\'m going to call her "Vanguard").

100,000 Kl of ammonia has about 53,364,000 Kg of Nitrogen.  A 100GW plant 
should emit about 4Kg per second.  How detectable that is I have no idea
at all.

A half-way radioactive planet is also just about impossible.  And

A good battlefield damper can totally inert the radioactives in 288

Humans I wasn\'t concerned with.  How do the ALIENS feel about it?  If

consider us attractive?  Admittedly Vargr should have similar sexual cues

[]On the same topic, one thing that always bothered me was that population was

 ---- Chart deleted ----

I would also suggest some sort of population/area vs. tech limit.  We have
5+ billion on "one earth area" at TL8 and we are starting to hit the edge
of the envelope...I don\'t think it would be possible to sustain that many
people with victorian era (TL4.5) technology, much less with TL1 (possible
due to the +1 mod for pop 9).  I think we\'d be lucky to stuff 5 million cavemen
on earth at TL0.  I am re-starting a Trav campaign, and as such have written 
an "update" program that I can plug in a spinward marches UPP and have it spit
out my persoanl alterations. 

[]Also, TL 9-B should reduce the effects of tainted atmosphere to tolerable
[](say, carginogenic, or perhaps a simple lung-wash is needed every month),
[]C-D should make it nothing but a faint odor, and E+ should eliminate tainting
[]altogether. Remove the requirement for atmospheric type (make it 0-9) for
[]industrial worlds.

But the tainting should still reduce the population a tad...

[]Anyone want to reinterpret the TLs to make it more sane? I don\'t mean changing

[]more specific high-technology. Ship design is going to be re-done anyway,
[]and all the high-tech weapons are silly to begin with.

Scott "2G" Kellogg sez...

[]}maximum armour value at TL15 is 115 (maybe), which translates to about

This is probably the big bugaboo about armor maximums -- limit the thickness,
not the rating.

[]Here\'s a question for you...If you carry your fuel as ammonia, what do you do
[]with the nitrogen after processing?  Vent it to space?  Store it for those
[]times when you use wilderness refuelling and recombine it with the H2 so you
[]can store it as ammonia again?
[]
[]If you vent it, would it be possible to detect a ship by the cloud of nitrogen
[]it leaves behind it?  Or would it be a trail of N?  Would it leave enough N
[]to detect, perhaps by the wavelengths of light it absorbs from the local sun?
[]How much N would be contained in a tankful of ammonia?

Vent it as reaction mass...

threads that have gone through the TML before I lose regular net access
for the forseeable future.  


NUCLEAR DAMPERS: 

    I once had a campaign in which we used nuclear dampers to clean up
areas which had been rendered radioactive by bombardment.  Remember the
old adventure _Leviathan_?  The character who played the captain of the
ship dicovered 0409 Egyrn, the T-norm world that had killed itself in
a nuclear war.  Due to other events in the campaign, around the time of
the 5FW he was awarded a barony over the world with instructions to 
eventually bring it, and hopefully the area, under Imperial rule.  This
may seem an incredible reward, but he was given relatively limited
resources, considering that he was very near the Zhodani colony at
Pa\'an/Egyrn....
    It was a lot of fun.  Ruined cities, colonization of the world, 
Zhodani intrigue and outright warfare when both sides dared, and the
possibility that not *all* the original alien inhabitants died made for
aa complicated background.  
    What does this have to do with dampers?  One of the projects he
assigned the Imperial Corps of Engineers involved cleaning up the
contaminated areas so that survey teams and colonists could enter the
area.  He mounted expensive nuclear dampers on armored gravitic vehicles,
and they slowly would treat an area in order to remove the dangerous
contamination. It took a long time to clear even a small area -- first
the area was damped as if the vehicles were plowing it, and then teams
had to go in and make sure nothing was missed, and he was continually
trying to work out something to do with the residual material left
behind in the soil -- lead.  Besides this, he only had so many decontam
vehicles and teams to spare, and not a few hostile neighbors in the
subsector to keep them occupied with other things.  He only could take
the time to clean up the areas he wanted to concentrate on or investigate.
Sometimes, an area would be finished and a storm of rain or dust would
come through, recontaminating everything.


ALIEN ROMANCE:

    I noticed in S&A that the Aslan seem to consider such liaisons *very*
dishonorable.  The fact that they consider them at all probably means that
there are some of the Ftierle who do engage in what most of their folk
would normally consider perverted....


TNE and the VIRUS FROM HELL:

    I\'d like to second Metlay\'s comments.  I could put up with minor
typos in the rules when Traveller was going strong.  But then GDW 
decided that publishing more rule books would be more profitable than
supporting their games with supplements and adventures.  In the last
five years, the only adventure I can think of that they\'ve published
was Knightfall, which missed out on the opportunity to develop the
Rebellion in favor of doing a more balanced "Secret of the Ancients"
adventure, complete with typos.  
    Now I hear that another set of rule books are planned, and that
the current setting will get axed, without any further development.
Furthermore, an unlikely plot device is suggested in place of an
obvious and more reasonable one -- a space virus instead of the gradual
collapse of the Empire.  A sourcebook is planned -- for fall release.
Fall, eh?  Makes me wonder sometimes how serious GDW actually is about
this talk of "increased support".  I\'ve played this game for a long
time, but I doubt that I\'ll be buying another new rule set quickly.

    Incidentally, does anyone know how close DGP and GDW were in
contact on the design of S&A?  It seems to me that they\'re trying to
set up an internal civil war for the Aslan as well, with the little
comments about Yerlyariwo/Khaukeairl dishonor and reckless young clans.
I can just see them setting this war off when they activate the idiotic
space computer virus just to keep them from taking the Daibei area
away.  Knock out two of the most important governments in Known Space
to slow things down?  Any comments or thoughts?
